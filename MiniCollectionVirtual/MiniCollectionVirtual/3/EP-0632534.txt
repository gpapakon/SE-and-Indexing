<ABSTRACT>
For an electric connector, in particular between a generator and 
an electronic controller for inflatable restraint systems 

(airbags) in motor vehicles, with a connector housing for housing 
the contact tubes with leads, where the connector housing in the 

coupling position lifts a jumper, disposed in a receptacle for 
the generator-sided plug pins, from the plug pins, it is provided 

in order to simplify the assembly and mount the connector 
reliably on the generator, that the connector housing (1) 

exhibits an assembly opening (2), which can be closed by means of 
a cover member (11), that the cover member (11) can slide over 

the assembly opening (2) of the connector housing (1) and can be 
held at the connector housing (1) by means of a pin (16), 

arranged in front in the push-on direction, and guide elements 
(12, 13, 14, 15), attached to the front and rear regions of the 

longitudinal sides, and can be arrested at the connector housing 
(1) in a preclick-stop position and click-stop position by means 

of shoulders (21) designed on the longitudinal sides, and 
strip-shaped extensions (18), which reach in the click-stop 

position as the blocking element behind hook-shaped spring 
elements (19, 20), which are attached to the connector housing 

(1) and engage with recesses (24) of the generator (29), and 
prevent a return swing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric connector, in particular 
between a generator and an electronic controller for inflatable 
restraint systems (airbags) in motor vehicles, with a connector 
housing for housing the contact tubes with leads, where the 
connector housing in the coupling position lifts a jumper, 
disposed in a receptacle for the generator-sided plug pins, 
from the plug pins. Known connectors of the above class are used in ignition systems 
in order to avoid unwanted triggering of ignitions. They exhibit 
the drawback that not only are the designs of said connectors 
complicated but the connection between connector housing and 
ignition generator is unstable, thus enabling unintentional 
separations and preventing the ignition systems from functioning 
reliably. The object of the invention is to provide a connector, whose 
construction and assembly is simple, and to provide measures for 
a reliable hold of the same at the generator. This problem is solved according to the invention in that the 
connector housing exhibits an assembly opening, which can be 
closed by means of a cover member, that the cover member can 
slide over the assembly opening of the connector housing and can 
be held at the connector housing by means of a pin, arranged in 
front in the push-on direction, and guide elements, attached to  
 
the front and rear regions of the longitudinal sides, and can be 
arrested at the connector housing in a preclick-stop position and 
click-stop position by means of shoulders designed on the 
longitudinal sides, and strip-shaped extensions, which reach in 
the click-stop position as the blocking element behind 
hook-shaped spring elements, which are attached to the connector 
housing and engage with recesses of the generator, and prevent a 
return swing. The connector housing, designed thus, can be 
equipped in a simple manner with contact tubes and leads, while 
the dual function of the cover member guarantees that the 
connector housing is closed reliably and mounted on the 
generator, whereby only a simple sliding movement of the cover 
member is required for these operations. It is self-evident that the receptacle provided with the jumper 
can be formed by means of a tube, which may or may not be mounted 
in a pre-fabricated state on the connector housing, e.g. a plug 
extension, and can be attached together with the connector 
housing to the generator or designed separately from the 
connector housing directly on the generator. The design of the connector provides that the

Electric connector, in particular between a generator and an

in motor vehicles, with a connector housing for housing the 
contact tubes with leads, where the connector housing in the 

coupling position lifts a jumper, disposed in a receptacle for 
the generator-sided plug pins, from the plug pins, characterized 

in that the connector housing (1) exhibits an assembly opening 
(2), which can be closed by means of a cover member (11), that 

the cover member (11) can slide over the assembly opening (2) of 
the connector housing (1) and can be held at the connector 

housing (1) by means of a pin (16), arranged in front in the 
push-on direction, and guide elements (12, 13, 14, 15), attached 

to the front and rear regions of the longitudinal sides, and can 
be arrested at the connector housing (1) in a preclick-stop 

position and click-stop position by means of shoulders (21) 
designed on the longitudinal sides, and strip-shaped extensions 

(18), which reach in the click-stop position as the blocking 
element behind hook-shaped spring elements (19, 20), which are 

attached to the connector housing (1) and engage with recesses 
(24) of the generator (29), 
and prevent a return swing. 
Connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the connector housing (1) accepts an electric attenuating element 

(7), which envelops the leads (5, 6) to the contact tubes (3, 4) 
and is made, e.g., of a ferrite material, for electrical and/or 

magnetic fields that build up in the region of the leads (5, 6). 
Connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the extensions (21) are wedge-shaped and can be slid into the 

recesses (22, 28), which are designed in succession in the shape 
 

of saw teeth and form pre-click-stop and click-stop positions in 
the push-on direction of the cover member (11) in the connector 

housing (1). 
Connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the guide elements are formed by strips and/or ribs and/or wedge 

elements. 
Connector as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the receptacle exhibiting the jumper (25) is formed by means of a 

tube (23) receiving a plug extension (9) that is stationary in 
the connector housing. 
Connector as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the plug extension (9) exhibits a groove-shaped recess (31), 

which forms together with a shoulder (30), which is rigidly 
attached to the tube, a coding between connector housing (1) and 

tube (23).
