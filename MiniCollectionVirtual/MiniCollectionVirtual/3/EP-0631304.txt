<ABSTRACT>
A system (60) and method for monitoring, evaluating and controlling 
the uniformity of a semiconductor wafer fabrication process is provided for 

use in manufacturing integrated circuits on semiconductor wafers (40). By 
using 
in situ
 ellipsometry (20) in conjunction with statistical modeling 
methods, the spatial etch rate pattern across a semiconductor wafer (40) may 

be inferred as a function of the process conditions. A predicted mean etch 
rate may be calculated for other locations (46 and 48) on the semiconductor 

wafer surface (42) by using the mean etch rate measured at the selected 
ellipsometer site (44) and individual spatial etch rate models developed for 

each site (44 and 48) based on statistically designed experiments. The 
predicted mean etch rate at the other sites (46 and 48) is also a function of 

the fabrication process conditions. The method for evaluating uniformity 
may be used with fabrication processes such as oxidation, doping, etching or 

any other process which may be measured 
in situ
 at a selected location (44) 
on a semiconductor wafer (40) during the fabrication process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated circuits, and more particularly
relates to monitoring and evaluating uniformity of semiconductor wafer
fabrication processes.Various processes and procedures are used to fabricate integrated
circuits on semiconductor wafers. Examples of these processes include
oxidation of silicon to form a silicon dioxide (SiO2) film on a silicon substrate
and microlithography which generally involves placing a radiation sensitive
material (sometimes referred to as a "photoresist" or "resist") on the oxide
film. Structural features of the integrated circuit are frequently developed
on the wafer by either depositing material, oxidation, or removing the
underlying material (etching). Typically, the resist is radiated through a
mask placed over the resist by lithography techniques such as
photolithography, electron beam lithography or x-ray lithography. The resist 
reacts chemically in the exposed areas of the mask depending upon the
choice of the chemical system.Other processes commonly associated with semiconductor wafer
fabrication include diffusion of controlled impurities or dopants into the
films. Ion implantation is also used to introduce controlled impurities into
the films. Additional fabrication processes include physical vapor deposition
of thin films by sputtering and physical vapor deposition of thin films by
evaporation.The sequence of wafer fabrication processes and procedures are
selected depending upon the type of semiconductor wafer and the desired
operating characteristics of the integrated circuit which will be fabricated on
the semiconductor wafer. Fabrication processes are frequently repeated
several times to build up multiple layers associated with modern very large
scale integrated circuits which are fabricated on semiconductor wafers.Etching is a commonly used process in the fabrication of many
integrated circuits on semiconductor wafers having a silicon substrate.
Etching involves removal of material from the silicon substrate and/or
selected thin film layers which were previously deposited on the surface of
the silicon substrate. When a mask is used to protect portions of the wafer
surface, the goal of etching is to remove material which is not covered by the
mask. The primary objective of the etching process is to precisely transfer
the pattern established by the protective mask onto the underlying material. Various techniques such as ellipsometry are used to measure film
thickness on semiconductor wafers. Ellipsometry also measures the optical
index of
