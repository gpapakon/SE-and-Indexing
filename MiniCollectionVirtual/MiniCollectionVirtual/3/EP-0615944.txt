<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and a device for severing a fibre sliver on a drawframe in preparation for the can change. The object of the invention is to avoid the disadvantages of the state of the art at a lower outlay for severing the fibre sliver and, after severance, always to guarantee a specific fibre-sliver length in relation to the can. According to the procedure, the fibre sliver is severed between a pair of calender rollers (4) and a sliver-guide channel (7). The severing device (2) can be arranged correspondingly in this region.

A method of sliver separation on a drawing frame, wherein the sliver is conveyed into a 
sliver-guiding duct (7) through a pair of calender rollers (4) and is deposited in a can 

(6) and the sliver delivery on the drawing frame is stopped while the cans are changed, 

characterized in that
 the sliver (
FB
) is clamped by folding onto the opening edge of 
the sliver-guiding duct (7) situated directly opposite the pair of calender rollers and is 

then separated mechanically between the pair of calender rollers (4) and the said sliver-guiding 
duct (7). 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a clamping point (
A
) is formed 
by folding the sliver onto the opening edge of the sliver-guiding duct (7). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the separated 
leading end of the sliver is blown by means of air out of a nozzle (100) into the sliver-guiding 

duct (7). 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a clamping point (
B
) is formed 
by moving the sliver transversely towards a pivotable wall portion of the sliver-guiding 

duct (7) positioned in the direction of movement. 
A drawing frame with a pair of calender rollers (4) and a sliver-guiding duct (7) 
arranged downstream thereof, and a sliver-separating device for performing the method 

according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 a mechanical 
separating device (2) is arranged between the pair of calender rollers (4) and the 

directly opposite opening edge of the sliver-guiding duct (7), and the upper opening 
edge of the said sliver-guiding duct (7) is a device for clamping the sliver. 
A drawing frame with a pair of calender rollers (4) and a sliver-guiding duct (7) 
arranged downstream thereof, and a sliver-separating device for performing the method 

according to one or more of Claims 1, 3 and 4, 
characterized in that
 a mechanical 
separating device (2) is arranged between the pair of calender rollers (4) and the directly 

opposite opening edge of the sliver-guiding duct (7), and a wall portion pivotable on 
the upper opening edge of the sliver-guiding duct (7) is a device for clamping. 
A drawing frame according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the pivotable wall portion  
 

is a pivoting flap (102). 
A drawing frame according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the bearings (103, 104) 
of the pivoting flap (102) are arranged outside the imaginary median axis (
M
) thereof in 
the direction of opening edge of the sliver-guiding duct (7).
