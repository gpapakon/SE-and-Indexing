<ABSTRACT>
The pedal cranks (32, 34) on the propulsion group of a bicycle or similar 
rotate independently with respect to one another around axis (
a
), and is 
parallel and spaced at distance (d) from axis (
b
) of a chain drive sprocket 
wheel (28). Each pedal crank is constrained to rotate together with the 

sprocket wheel but is free to travel over said wheel. An adjustment for the 
position of the sprocket wheel, around the axis of the pedal cranks, is 

provided for.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the field of energy transmission between components having a 
reciprocating motion and components having a rotating motion, continuous 
technical research has aimed at improving the efficiency of such 
transmissions. In the bicycle sector, in particular, there has been a continuous effort to 
take greater advantage of the energy imparted to the pedals by the rider 
through the use of multipliers, gear ratios, gear selectors, etc. The invention is intended to further improve the transmission performance 
between the energy imparted by the person or other means acting upon 
the pedal cranks or pedals, and the energy that can actually be used for 
the propulsion of, for example, bicycles and similar. It was observed that, in prior art bicycles whose pedal cranks are 
connected together and rotatable around an axis coinciding with the axis of 
the chain drive sprocket wheel, the energy transmitted by the rider is 
variable according to the position of the pedals as they travel in a circular 
path around the axis of rotation; see figure 4. In fact, such energy is 
decidedly lower in the part where a traction force is exerted on the pedal 
(upward pedal travel) and significantly greater in the part where pressure is 
exerted on the pedal (downward pedal travel) and having two areas with 
no efficiency in the transmission of movement (dead centers), i.e., where  
 
the pedal cranks are both in a direction that substancially coincides with 
the directions of the forces acting upon the pedal cranks. To explain in greater detail, during a single 360° clockwise rotation of 
pedals A-B, the pedal cranks consecutively assume the positions 
illustrated in steps 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d. The positions in which the pedal cranks 
are vertical (4a, 4c) or close to a vertical position (for simplicity's sake, only 
vertical positions will be mentioned hereafter), are virtually or completely 
inefficient for transmitting energy from the rider to the bicycle; from an 
inclined position at angle α, clockwise with respect to a vertical position, 
and for the entire arc of 180°-2α as indicated in figure 4a, the rider exerts a 
very effective pressure on the pedal traveling over said arc (pedal B in 
figure 4b, pedal A in figure 4d); and, if a suitable pedal is used, the rider 
can simultaneously exert a less effective traction force on the other pedal, 
A or B.  
 FR-A-763303 discloses a device according to the preamble of claim 1. The 
prior art device is shown with a fixed, non-modifiable eccentricity between the 
pedal cranks axis
