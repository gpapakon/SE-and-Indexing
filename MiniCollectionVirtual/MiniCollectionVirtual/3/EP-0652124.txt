<ABSTRACT>
A bottom outlet type air conditioning 
accumulator canister avoids the drain down problem 

inherent with bottom outlets by providing an internal 
return tube (34) that has two complete loops, 

including three legs (38,44,48) and an upper (46) and 
lower (40) bight. A bleed hole assembly (42) for 

aspirating out collected liquid is located in the 
lower bight, while the upper bight prevents drain down 

through the bleed hole when the system sits idle. The 
upper bight is also located just below the upper end 

(36) of the return tube, so that a pair of saddle bag 
style desiccant pouches (52) can be hung over the 

upper tube end and rest on the upper bight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bottom outlet 
accumulator/dehydrator assemblies for vehicle air 
conditioning systems in general, and specifically to 
such an assembly that has internal, integral 
protection against leak down into the compressor 
outlet line. Vehicle air conditioning systems include a 
compressor that compresses and superheats refrigerant 
vapour, which then runs through a condenser, expander 
and evaporator in turn before returning to the 
compressor to begin the cycle again. The output of 
the evaporator includes more than just refrigerant, 
carrying a component of lubricating oil and some small 
amount of water, all three of which are in a 
vapour-liquid mixture. Interposed between the 
evaporator and compressor is a so called accumulator (see document 
US-A-5 179 844), 
also known as an accumulator dehydrator (hereinafter 
referred to as an A/D), which is designed to 
accomplish several objectives. Primarily, the so 
called A/D operates as its name would suggest, 
receiving and accumulating the evaporator output and 
serving as a reservoir or separator in which liquid 
collects at the bottom and vapour at the top. A 
return tube internal to the canister has an open inlet 
located near the canister top end. The canister 
suction line is connected to an outlet end of the 
return tube, so that the compressor draws primarily 
vapour, through the return tube inlet. However, the 
accumulated liquid also has to be drawn out, since it 
will not vaporise quickly enough to simply be drawn 
out from the vapour space at the top of the canister. 
To draw down the accumulated liquid, a bleed hole 
assembly, consisting of a small hole in the return 
tube and a surrounding filter screen, is located on  
 
the return tube, near the canister bottom end. As 
suction is applied to the return tube, accumulated 
liquid, both the refrigerant and oil component, is 
aspirated through the bleed hole. The shape of the return tube varies 
depending on where its outlet can be located. 
Ideally, the return tube outlet can be placed high in 
the canister, near the upper end. This allows the 
return tube to have a U shape, with the bleed hole 
assembly located at the bottom bend in the U. Then, 
there is a built in trap to prevent accumulated liquid 
from draining down into the compressor suction line 
when the compressor is off for extended periods. This 
can cause so called "slugging," undesirable noise when 
the compressor is turned on again. Sometimes, under 
hood packaging and line routing considerations dictate

<CLAIMS>
A bottom outlet accumulator/dehydrator 
for use in a vehicle air conditioning system having an 

inlet line (22) from an evaporator (20) from which a 
mixture of liquid and vapour refrigerant is received, 

and an outlet suction line (12) to a compressor (14), 
comprising a generally cylindrical canister having top 

and bottom circular ends (26,28) and a cylindrical 
internal volume that is divided into four quadrants, 

the canister having a connection (30) for the inlet 
line located substantially above the bottom end so 

that liquid refrigerant collects in the internal 
volume near the bottom end with vapour rising to the 

top end; a continuous, one piece return tube (34) 
internal to the canister having a first leg (38) 

extending downwardly from an open inlet end (36) near 
the top end through a first quadrant to a lower bight 

(40) located near the bottom end, a second leg (44) 
extending upwardly from the lower bight through a 

second quadrant and crossing over to a third quadrant 
to an upper bight (46) located near the top end, and a 

third leg (48) extending downwardly from the upper 
bight through a fourth quadrant to a lower outlet end 

(50) opening through the bottom end and connectable to 
the outlet suction line; and a liquid bleed hole 

assembly (42) mounted to the lower bight, whereby, 
when the compressor is on, the suction line draws 

refrigerant vapour from the canister through the open 
inlet end and aspirates collected liquid through the 

bleed hole assembly, and when the compressor is off, 
collected liquid is prevented from draining into the 

suction line by the upper bight. 
A bottom outlet accumulator/dehydrator 
as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the first leg (38) 

extends radially outwardly from the open inlet end  
 

(36) near the centre of the top end (26); and wherein 
the third leg (48) extends radially inwardly from the 

upper bight (46) to the lower outlet end (50) opening 
near the centre of the bottom end (28). 
A bottom outlet accumulator/dehydrator 
as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the upper 

bight (46) is located adjacent and below the inlet end 
(36). 
A bottom outlet accumulator/dehydrator 
as claimed
 in Claim 3, further comprising a desiccant 
pouch (52) resting on the upper bight (46), 

substantially above the level of collected liquid.
