<ABSTRACT>
A guarantee seal of the type that consists of a 
flexible strip (1), one end of which terminates in a head (2) 

provided with means that cooperate with means provided on 
the other end (3) of the strip to prevent said strip from 

being extracted once it has been inserted into the head, 
said means of the head consisting of two internal teeth (9), 

each of which defines a notch (12), and two openings at the 
bottom, and said means of the opposite end consisting of 

an elastically deformable terminal in the shape of an 
arrowhead comprisina two converging branches (6) each of 

which is provided with teeth (8) at the diverging ends, said 
teeth cooperating with the notches (12) of the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to guarantee seal, 
i.e. a seal which ensures that the container which it 
protects remains perfectly sealed in such a way that said 
container can only be opened by breaking the seal, providing 
clear evidence that such an action has taken 
place. Seals of this type are known and have the form of a 
naturally flexible strip, preferably plastic, that terminates 
at one end in a small grooved head through which 
the other end passes, said head being provided with 
fastening means which go through the body of the strip as 
it passes through said head and which become immovable, 
i.e. once they have been sealed or fastened it is impossible 
to open them again without breaking the ring formed 
by the seal at any point along its length.  In general, these seals become structurally complex 
if a high level of effectiveness or security is to be 
achieved. The guarantee seal of the invention is of the type 
described above, i.e. formed by a ring which becomes 
immovable once closed, and has been designed and constructed 
to achieve optimum guarantees of security by means 
of an extremely simple structure as well as a simple 
closing operation. More particularly, to achieve this the seal proposed 
by the invention is made of an elongated, flexible body, 
which may be laminar, such as those described above, or 
may be have the form of a cord, without affecting the 
basic concept of the invention, but where in either case 
one of its ends terminates in a flat terminal and the 
other end in a small grooved head. More particularly, the flat terminal defines a kind 
of elastically deformable arrowhead which converges 
towards its free end to make it easier to insert into the 
groove of the head, and on which are provided two rear, 
lateral, interlocking teeth corresponding to complimentary 
teeth provided inside the groove of the head, just 
inside its opening, such that these complimentary teeth 
of the head at first force the two parts of the flat 
terminal to converge, by deforming it elastically, until 
the teeth of said terminal have passed beyond those of 
the groove, at which point the flat terminal recovers 
elastically and becomes perfectly adapted inside the 
groove of the head with the teeth of both elements permanently 
interlocked, since when the seal is pulled to 
try and extract the flat terminal from the head, the 
special configuration of said teeth tends to cause them  
 
to become interlocked even more tightly. Finally, it only remains to be said that although 
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A guarantee seal of the type that consists of an 
elongated, flexible body (1) in the form of a band or a 

cord normally made of plastic, characterized essentially 
in that one of its ends incorporates a small head (2) 

provided with a transverse groove (3), whilst the other 
end of said elongated, flexible body incorporates a flat 

terminal (5) which defines a kind of elastically deformable 
arrowhead that can be snap-fitted into the groove 

(3) of the head (2) such that after it has been fitted it 
cannot be removed. 
A guarantee seal according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the flat terminal (5) is provided with two 

lateral branches (6) that converge towards the free end, 
a front cutout (7) being defined between them to make the 

elastic deformation of the terminal easier, said branches 
each ending in diverging rear, lateral teeth (8) which 

constitute the means of interlocking the head (2), whilst 
said head (2) incorporates lateral complimentary teeth 

(9), just inside the opening (4), behind which notches or 
sharp steps (12) are defined for engaging the teeth (8) 

of the flat terminal (5). 
A guarantee seal according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the groove (3) of the head (2), whose size 

and shape are approximately the same as those of the flat 
terminal (5), is provided at the bottom with small holes 

(10) that lead to the outside and through which pass the 
front ends (11) of the lateral branches (6) of the flat 

terminal (5), said holes (10) being totally blocked by 
said branches (6) as a result of snap-fitting the terminal 

into the head.
