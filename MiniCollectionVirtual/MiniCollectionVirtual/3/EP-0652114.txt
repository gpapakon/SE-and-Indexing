<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer
image-receiving sheet. More particularly, it relates to
a thermal transfer image-receiving sheet having a dye-receptive
layer of which the texture is similar to that
of the so-called "plain paper."A thermal transfer sheet comprising a substrate
sheet and a dye layer provided on one surface of the
substrate sheet has hitherto been used in an output print
for computers and word processors by a thermal
sublimation dye transfer system. This thermal transfer
sheet comprises a heat-resisting substrate sheet and a
dye layer formed by coating an ink comprising a mixture
of a binder with a sublimable dye on the substrate sheet
and drying the resultant coating. Heat is applied to the
thermal transfer sheet from the back surface thereof to
transfer a number of color dots of three or four colors
to a material on which an image is to be transferred,
thereby forming a full color image. Since the colorant
used is a dye, the image thus formed has excellent
sharpness and transparency and high reproduction and
gradation of intermediate colors, which enables a high-quality
image comparable to the conventional full color
photographic image to be formed.Such a high-quality image, however, cannot be
formed on a transfer material undyable with a dye, such
as plain paper. In order to solve this problem, a
thermal transfer image-receiving sheet comprising a
substrate sheet and a dye-receptive layer previously
formed on the substrate sheet has been used in the art.Conventional thermal transfer image-receiving
sheets are generally thick and have a dye-receptive layer
of which the surface has a texture close to the so-called
"photographic paper" rich in gloss, so that in some sense
they can be said to give an impression of high grade. However, in the so-called "applications in office,"
the gloss of the surface of the dye-receptive layer and
the hard texture of the sheet per se give a poor image to
users. In order to overcome this problem, a thermal
transfer image-receiving sheet, particularly one which
has a surface having a texture close to plain paper and
can be handled like copying paper, has been desired in
the art.The present invention has been made under these
circumstances, and an object of the present invention is
to provide a thermal transfer image-receiving sheet,
particularly one which particularly has a surface having
a texture close to plain paper and can be handled like
copying paper.In order to attain the above object, the present
invention provides a thermal
