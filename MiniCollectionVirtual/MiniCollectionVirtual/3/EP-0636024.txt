<ABSTRACT>
An antimicrobial composition comprising an antimicrobially effective amount of a combination of: A) a monoglyceride of lauric acid, a monoglyceride of monomyristic acid or a mixture of these monoglycerides, and B) at least one chemical substance selected from the following group: i) local anaesthetics of the amide type; ii) carbamide; iii) antibacterial substances in the form of steroid antibiotics, imidazole derivatives or nitroimidazole derivatives, and iv) diols with 3 - 6 carbon atoms, and C) optionally, a conventional physiologically acceptable carrier and/or physiologically acceptable additives. A process for the preparation of this composition by heating (A) to the transition temperature of the lipid, adding (B), and optionally (C), and cooling the mixture to form a solid lipid crystal composition. Use of the composition for the preparation of a dermatological preparation for combatting bacteria and fungi or as a preservative additive in a cosmetic product, a food product, or a medical product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel antimicrobial
composition and to a process for the preparation thereof.
The invention further relates to the composition for use
as a pharmaceutical composition, to the use of the
composition for the preparation of a pharmaceutical
preparation as well as to usages of said composition as a
preservative additive in cosmetic, medical or food
products. More specifically, the composition contains
certain special monoglycerides which potentiate the
antimicrobial properties of previously known antimicrobial
compounds or impart antimicrobial properties to compounds
which have not in themselves been regarded as
antimicrobials.The use of antibacterial substances is common within, by
way of example, the field of dermatology. The aim of this
use is partly to treat the patient with a specific
antibacterial substance against some infection, e.g
antimycotics against fungal infections, partly to preserve
the products against microbial contamination.In cases where a patient is to be treated, specific-action
antimicrobial substances without general effects are
often used. The disadvantage of such treatments is that
"typing", a dermination in order to enable choice of the
appropriate preparation, must be undertaken before the
treatment. Additionally, there is the risk that other
microorganisms may invade during treatment against which
the preparation has no effect. On the other hand, if the antimicrobial substance is used
as a preservative in the product, it is desirable that it
has no effect on the patient, either of an antimicrobial
or a toxic nature. The substances that are nowadays used
for this purpose are well documented as regards
preservative effects but it is also known that many of
them exhibit toxic effects in some form or other.The present invention enables the elimination or at least
the drastic reduction of the above shortcomings or
disadvantages.In the practice of the invention, it has surprisingly been
found that the combination of particular monoglycerides
with certain specific groups of chemical substances
provides a synergistic effect with regard to antimicrobial
properties. In this respect, it has been established that
the invention not only provides a synergistic effect in
relation to compounds which were previously known to
exhibit certain antimicrobial properties, but that it also
leads to synergistic effects in relation to chemical
substances which had previously not been known to exhibit
antimicrobial properties at all.Aside from the monoglycerides used in

<CLAIMS>
An antimicrobial composition, characterized in
that it comprises an antimicrobially effective amount of a

combination of:

A) a monoglyceride of lauric acid, a monoglyceride
of myristic acid or a mixture of these monoglycerides,

and
B) at least one chemical substance selected from
urea, fusidic acid, econazole nitrate (1-(2,4-dichloro-beta-(p-chlorobenzyloxy)-phenethyl)imidazol

nitrate), mikonazole nitrate (1((2(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2((2,4-dichlorophenyl)methoxy)-ethyl)-1H-imidazol
nitrate), tinidazole

(1-(2-(ethylsulphonyl)ethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole),
metronidazole (1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole

and pentanediol, and
C) optionally, a conventional physiologically acceptable
carrier and/or physiologically acceptable

additives, the concentration of A) being from
0.2 ppm to 30% and of B) being from 1 ppm to 20%,

in both cases calculated as weight of the total
weight of the composition.
A composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the chemical substance B) is fusidic acid.
A composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the chemical substance B) is econazole

nitrate.
A composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the chemical substance B) is tinidazole.
A composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the chemical substance B) is urea. 
A composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that the pentanediol is 1,5-pentanediol.
A composition according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the monoglyceride A)

is a monolaurate, preferably 1-glycerol monolaurate or
3-glycerol monolaurate.
