<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a divisible oblong tablet, intended in particular for pharmaceutical applications. When the tablet is placed on a flat surface, the underside of the tablet makes contact with the surface at two zones which extend out from the underside of the tablet at each end but does not make contact over the zone in between, the zones extending out at each end of the tablet being fashioned as bulges. A tablet of this kind can be easily divided into two halves using one hand and picked up from a flat surface. It is also easy to manufacture.

<CLAIMS>
Divisible oblong tablet in which each of the two 
ends of the tablet underside and upper side have a 

zone which extends in such a way that, when one of 
the said sides is laid on a flat surface, the 

extending zones but not the intervening zone touch 
the surface, wherein the extending zones are shaped 

like bulges. 
Tablet as claimed in claim 1, wherein the tablet is 
in the form of a dumb-bell. 
Tablet as claimed in claim 1, wherein it consists 
of a flat plate (2) in which bulges (3) extend from 

both of the large plate areas that are opposite to 
one another. 
Tablet as claimed in claim 3, wherein the large 
areas of the plate (2) are in the shape of an 

oblong with semi-circular end zones and have 
lateral edges parallel to the longitudinal axis in 

the middle zone of the tablet (1), the distance 
between the edges parallel to the longitudinal axis 

preferably being the same as, but if desired also 
smaller or larger, than the diameter of the 

semicircles at the ends of the oblong whereby if 
the distance is smaller the circle sectors are 

larger than a semicircle.  
 
Tablet as claimed in claim 4, wherein the apexes of 
the bulges and the centres of the circles of the 

said semicircular end zones lie on the same 
straight line running perpendicular to the 

longitudinal axis of the tablet (1). 
Tablet as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the bulges (3) form spherical segments (4) 

at least in the region of the apexes. 
Tablet as claimed in claim 6, wherein second plates 
(5) which taper towards the spherical segments (4) 

form the transition between the spherical segments 
(4) and the plate (2). 
Tablet as claimed in claim 6 or 7, wherein the 
diameter of the spheres of the spherical segments 

(4) is larger than the height of the tablet. 
Tablet as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8, 
wherein at least one breaking crevice (6) is 

provided in their middle zone which runs 
perpendicular to the connecting line between the 

end zones of the tablet with which the tablet lies 
on a support during division. 
Tablet as claimed in one of the claims 3 to 9, 
wherein a groove (7) runs over the apex of at least 

one of the bulges (3) whose projection on one of 
the large areas of the plate (2) forms either no or 

at most an acute angle with the longitudinal axis 
of the tablet.  

 
Tablet as claimed in claim 10, wherein the edges 
which the groove (7) forms with the surface of the 

bulges (3) are mirror-symmetrical to a plane which 
is perpendicular to the plate (2).
