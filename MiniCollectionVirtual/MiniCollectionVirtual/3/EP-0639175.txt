A process for the preparation of 2-(dialkoxymethyl)-carboxylic 
acid esters of the formula I 


 
wherein 


R¹
is a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical or a 
heterocyclic non-aromatic radical, which apart 

from oxygen, nitrogen and/or sulfur atoms in 
the ring only contains carbon and hydrogen 

atoms, in each case having 1 to 20 carbon 
atoms, it being possible for the radical R¹ to 

carry 1 to 5 substituents and the substituents 
being identical or different and being halogen, 

an aryl, carbalkoxy, dialkylamino, diarylamino 
or cyano group or an alkoxy group, the alkyl 

being substituted or unsubstituted C₁- to C₁₂-alkyl, 
or is an aryloxy group, the aryl being 

substituted or unsubstituted C₆- to C₁₄-aryl, a 
substituted or unsubstituted benzyl or 

phenethyl radical or an R⁴O-(R⁵C)
X
-R⁵ group, 
where R⁴ is substituted or unsubstituted C₁- to 

C₁₂-alkyl or C₆- to C₁₄-aryl, R⁵ is a branched 
or unbranched hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 

4 carbon atoms or phenylene and x = 1 to 6, 
R²
is hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms 
and 
R³
is unsubstituted or substituted C₆- to C₁₄-aryl  
 

or a radical mentioned under R¹, 
 
by oxidizing β-acetalization of acrylic acid esters 

with alcohols R¹OH, wherein R¹ has the meaning 
mentioned, in the presence of oxygen as the oxidant 

and of a catalyst system based on one or more metals 
of the platinum group and/or compounds thereof and 

on a copper compound, which comprises carrying out 
the reaction at a temperature of up to 80°C and the 

catalyst system containing 1 to 4 equivalents of 
anions, based on the sum of the metal atoms and 

metal cations, of which at most 3 equivalents are 
halide ions, the halogen having a molecular weight 

of at least 35.
