<ABSTRACT>
A compact and high-performance electrical drive for powered vehicles is created according to the invention in that the rotor (19) of an electric motor (1) transmits its rotation via the rotor shaft (17) to a transmission which is arranged in a transmission housing (21) and has a differential transmission (23) which can be changed via couplings (clutches), which differential transmission has two output-drive shafts (25, 27) which drive the front wheels and the rear wheels of the powered vehicle via jointed shafts. In this case, one of the output-drive shafts (25) is mounted rotatably, by means of a needle bearing (43), in the rotor shaft (17), which is constructed as a hollow shaft.
