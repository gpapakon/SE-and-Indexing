<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for making a double carpet fabric, with weft threads (S3,S4;S2,S1) inserted in pairs into the upper cloth and the lower cloth, with pile threads (OP,UP) which are distributed as dead piles over the two cloths, are tied according to a dead-pile control programme and can be alternately assigned to a pattern-pile control programme according to the particular pattern. With the aim of making a cloth of high pile density which is free of mixed contours, the weft threads (S3,S4;S1,S2) are assigned alternately in pairs to the upper cloth and the lower cloth, the pile-thread change is carried out between pile threads consisting of different materials, when the last-patterning pile thread (OPM,UPM) is located in its outer shed, the two pile threads are held in the respective outer shed over the period of shed entry and are assigned there to the other control programme for pile threads (OP,UP); and the pile-thread change takes place between pile threads consisting of identical materials in such a way that a respective pile thread (OP,UP) of the interchanging pair is held in the outer shed for the next pass, and the other pile thread (UP,OP) changes between its own middle shed (3) and the foreign outer shed (1,2).
