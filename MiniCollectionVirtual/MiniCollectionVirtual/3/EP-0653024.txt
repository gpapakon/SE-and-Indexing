<DESCRIPTION>
 FASTENER FOR HOLDING OBJECTS TO A PERFORATED WALLBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to fasteners, and more particularly to fasteners for holding objects to a perforated wall.Brief Description of the Prior ArtA wide variety of useful fasteners for holding objects to walls is available to the public and has been for many years. When attaching objects to a perforated wall, the available fasteners are much fewer in number, and those that are available have many severe drawbacks.For the sake of convenience, in this specification, the term "tool holder" will be used to represent that group of implements that are attached to a perforated wall board by insertion of an element into at least one hole and used to hold hand tools, garden tools, instruments, wires, cables, display items (such as package hangers or shelves) , picture hangers, and the like. The term "wall" shall be used to represent that group of wall-like structures in which at least one hole is made and which accommodates and supports a tool holder by means of insertion of a part of the tool holder into the hole.The typical tool holder, whether it be a hook, a straight bar, or a loop for holding different types of tools such-. s screwdrivers, usually has a bent rod-like offset hooked portion at its top which is inserted into the hole by a rotating action of the fastener to situate the top tip of the hook behind the wallboar while allowing the lower part of the fastener to rest against the front surface of the wallboard. An improvement over this type of holder is to provide a pin or projection near the lower side of the tool holder which is inserted, without resistance to removal, into an adjacent hole in the pegboard. While the latter arrangement prevents rotation of the tool holder and avoids some of the frustration experienced using holders 

without the extra pin or projection below, those who use suc fasteners or holders for tools and the like still experienc frustration and irritation upon attempting to remove the too from the fastener, since the bottom portion of the fastener i easily pulled away from the wall surface because the pin o projection is loosely fitted into its hole.One known fastener used to secure rod-like tool holders to perforated wall or board is formed from a thin piece of wir (about 0.5 mm in diameter) into the shape of a half-sized hairpi with outwardly bowed legs defined by a sharp bend in each leg s that the bends are spaced apart greater than the diameter of th holes, and the bight
