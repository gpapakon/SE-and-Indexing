<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are mild shampoo and shampoo premix compositions, and methods of making mild shampoo and shampoo premixes that are substantially free of alkyl sulfates. The preferred shampoo premix comprises alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, a specific type of imidazolinium-type amphoteric surfactant, a crystalline suspending agent that is preferably solubilized and recrystallized in the premix composition, and a relatively low amount of water. The preferred shampoo compositions hereof comprise alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, imidazoline-type amphoteric surfactant, betaine surfactant, a recrystallized suspending agent, and water. The shampoos and shampoo premixes hereof can provide mild, good lathering, pearlescent compositions. The premix compositions hereof are particularly useful for use in mild shampoo compositions containing silicone conditioning agents and/or particulate antidandruff agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 mild shampoo compositionsTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention is related to shampoo premix composi¬ tions as well as finished shampoo compositions. The present invention also relates to methods of making said mild shampoo and shampoo premix compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMild shampoo compositions which provide low irritation to the skin are highly desirable. Conventional shampoos contain high levels of harsh anionic surfactants. These surfactants can provide excellent lathering and cleaning characteristics. How- ever, they can also penetrate the skin and destroy its integrity. This results, at the very least, in rough and/or dry skin, and can ultimately lead to red, irritated skin. Ideal shampoo composi¬ tions should provide sufficient lathering and cleaning benefits to cleanse the hair while at the same time causing little or no irritation to the skin. This is particularly essential for shampoo compositions used on babies, small children, or adults with dry or sensitive skin.Mild shampoo compositions, in general, are well known in the art having been taught in, for example, European Patent Applica- tion 0250181, published December 23, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,578,216, Fuji i et al., issued March 25, 1986; U.S. Patent 4,726,915, Verdicchio, issued February 23, 1988; U.K. Patent Specification 1,508,929, published April 26, 1978; European Patent Application 0160269, published November 6, 1985; U.S. Patent 4,435,300, Guth et al., issued March 6, 1984; U.S. Patent 4,426,310, Vernunica, issued January 17, 1984; U.S. Patent 3,950,417, Verdicchio et al . , issued April 13, 1976; U.S. Patent 4,443,362, Guth et al . , issued April 17, 1984; U.S. Patent 4,654,207, Preston, issued March 31, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,851,154, Grollier et al., issued July 25, 1989; U.S. Patent 4,292,212, Melby, issued September 29, 1981; and U.S. Patent 4,329,334, Su et al., issued May 11, 1982. These 

references teach the use of a wide variety of surfactant combina¬ tions to achieve mi ldness . These surfactants include mi ld anionic surfactants, such as ethoxyl ated alkyl sulfates, amphoteric surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and various combinations thereof.One well -known mild shampoo is Johnson's Baby Shampoo (John¬ son & Johnson) . This product contains relatively high l evel s of nonionic surfactant (PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate) and other mild surfactants to boost its cl eaning performance (betaine, ethoxy- l ated alkyl sul fate, an i idazol ine-derived amphoteric, and an ethoxylated al kyl carboxyl ate) .The formul ation of
