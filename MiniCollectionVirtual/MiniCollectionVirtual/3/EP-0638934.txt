<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of a semiconductor device, a first 
semiconductor wafer is provided with circuitry therein. A layer 

of spin-on glass material is deposited on the wafer. Then a 
second semiconductor wafer is placed on the spin-on glass 

material. The structure is then heated to cure the spin-on glass 
material. Further circuitry may then be formed in the second 

semiconductor wafer. Preferably, the spin-on glass forms a 
cross-linked siloxane polymer, which may be a poly-organo-siloxone 

having a carbon content of at least 5 per cent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of a 
semiconductor device. The invention also relates to a 
semiconductor device structure. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), Ultra Large Scale 
Integration (ULSI), and higher-density approaches to 
integrated circuit fabrication require reduced parasitic 
capacitances. One approach to reducing these capacitances 
is the use of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) techniques. In SOI 
fabrication, layers of device-quality silicon are formed 
upon insulating islands, as shown in Figure 1. In one 
method of SOI fabrication, silicon is grown upon sapphire 
(the INSULATOR in Figure 1) in an epitaxial growth step. In 
another method, shown in Figures 2A-2D, oxygen (or nitrogen) 
is implanted through silicon, to form a buried layer of 
silicon dioxide (or silicon nitride). After implantation, 
an epitaxial layer 3 may be added to the silicon located 
above the implant, in order to provide a thicker silicon 
layer. The silicon layer 6 provides the device-quality 
silicon. SOI technology is not without drawbacks. Epitaxial 
approaches have several disadvantages. Firstly, epitaxial 
growth is expensive; secondly, the epitaxially grown silicon 
is now always sufficiently defect-free; thirdly, adhesion 
problems can result between the epitaxial layer and the  
 
substrate; and fourthly, stresses can occur at the silicon-insulator 
interface, because of different thermal 
coefficients of expansion, and mismatch between the inter-atomic 
spacing of the silicon, compared with that of the 
insulator. Implantation approaches also face disadvantages. Thus 
the implantation approach requires implantation equipment, 
which is expensive. Also, during implantation, the 
implanted species disrupts the crystalline structure of the 
silicon. An annealing step is required to restore proper 
crystallinity of the silicon. A further disadvantage is 
that practical implantation energies cannot supply the 
required implant depth for most implant species. Further, a 
layer 3 in Figure 2C is frequently obtained, in which no 
substantial implantation occurred. Sometimes, this layer 3 
may be too thin, requiring that the thickness of layer 3 be 
increased. The increase in thickness is generally 
accomplished by epitaxial techniques, which require added 
processing steps, shown in Figure 2D. Moreover there 
is a limit to the amount of implanted species which can be 
implanted. Thus, the doping concentration, and hence the 
conductivity, of the implanted layer 6 in Figure 2D is 
limited. It is an object
