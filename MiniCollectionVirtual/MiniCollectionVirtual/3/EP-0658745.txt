<ABSTRACT>
A position detector (75), with the aid of which an electrical signal is generated and supplied to processing electronics (91) whenever a moving body (1) reaches a predeterminable position, is to be developed in such a manner that the processing electronics operate reliably even when their regular power supply has failed and the body approaches the predetermined position at a very low speed. For this purpose, an energy store (85) is provided which, when the body approaches the predeterminable position, collects and stores some of the energy of motion of the body in the form of potential energy and, when the position is reached, abruptly releases the stored potential energy in the form of kinetic energy, and a device (81, 84, 88) for transforming this kinetic energy into an electrical energy pulse which is supplied to the processing electronics.
