<ABSTRACT>
Aromatic polyether polymers, illustrated by polyethersulfones, polyetherketones and polyetherimides, are prepared by a phase transfer catalyzed reaction between a salt of a dihydroxyaromatic compound and a substituted aromatic compound such as bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) ketone or 1,3-bis[N-(4-chlorophthalimido)]benzene or the corresponding derivative of toluene or diphenyl ether, or the analogous fluoro-, bromo- or nitro-substituted compounds. The phase transfer catalysts employed are those which are stable at temperatures in the range of about 125-250  DEG C. Particularly preferred phase transfer catalysts are the hexaalkylguanidinium and  alpha , omega -bis(pentaalkylguanidinium)alkane salts and the corresponding heterocyclic salts.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PHASE TRANSFER CATA YSED PREPARATION OF AROMATTC POLYFTHER POT.YMERSThis invention relates to the preparation of aromatic polyether polymers, and more particularly to their preparation by a phase transfer catalyzed reaction.Various types of aromatic polyethers, particularly polyethersulfones and polyetherketones, have become important as engineering resins by reason of their excellent properties. These polymers are typically prepared by the reaction of salts of dihydroxyaromatic compounds, such as bisphenol A disodium salt, with dihaloaromatic molecules such as bis ( -fluorophenyl) sulfone, bis (4-chlorophenyl) sulfone or the analogous ketones.These reactions normally require the use of dipolar aprotic solvents, which are necessary to solubilize one or both reactants. Such solvents are expensive, difficult to purify and difficult to keep dry, since they readily dissolve water. Moreover, the polymers prepared by the use of such solvents are frequently colored by reason of the occurrence of side reactions leading to colored by-products.Another class of polymers capable of preparation by a similar method is the polyetherimides. U.S. Patents 3,787,364, 3,838,097 and 3,847,869 describe their preparation by the reaction of salts such as bisphenol A disodium salt with halo- or nitro-substituted bis (phthalimido) derivatives of aromatic diamines. These methods of preparation also require dipolar aprotic solvents. In addition, they frequently do not afford products of high molecular weight or in high yield. As a result, polyetherimides are normally produced on a commercial scale by the reaction of diamines with bis (ether anhydrides) . The latter reagents are generally themselves produced by a complex multi-step synthetic method often employing nitro-substituted 

phthali ides, which lead to the formation of by-products hazardous to the environment in varying degrees.There has been considerable attention directed in recent years to methods for conducting organic reactions in heterogeneous systems, employing a phase transfer catalyst which facilitates migration of a reactant into a phase from which it is normally absent. Thus, for example, bis (ether anhydrides) may be prepared by the reaction of a bisphenol disodium salt with a nitro- or halo-substituted phthalimide in a methylene chloride-water mixture, employing a phase transfer catalyst to promote migration of the otherwise methylene chloride-insoluble bisphenol salt into the organic layer for reaction with the substituted phthalimide.
