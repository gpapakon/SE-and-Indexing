<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing system is provided comprising a detergent supply pack (1) for supplying solid state detergent material to a dispensing device (4) associated with a washing machine and said dispensing device, which supply pack comprises packaging material for said solid state detergent material, said solid state detergent material and a closing/release device for promoting release of the detergent solid from the supply pack into the dispensing device, whereby the closing/release device comprises two movable parts (3a, 3b) in between which the packaging material is clamped and which, after closing, are blocked by locking studs, such that the locking studs can be released by placing the supply pack on a top centring frame of the dispensing device which is used as a key for opening the movable parts and introducing the solid detergent into the dispensing device. There are also provided a detergent supply pack and a dispensing device which are adapted for use in a dispensing system according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispensing system to be used 
for solid detergent products for institutional washing 
machines. The invention also relates to a detergent supply 
pack and a dispensing device, which are adapted for use in 
a dispensing system according to the invention.Furthermore, 
the invention relates to a method of dispensing a solid 
detergent product into the wash liquor to be fed to a 
washing machine. Hitherto, various products and packs have been developed to 
provide institutional washing machines, especially dish-washing 
machines, with a supply of detergent material from 
which measured amounts of detergent product are dispensed 
to the wash liquor in the washing machine. These products 
include detergent products in powder form, in liquid form 
and in paste form, which are generally packed in supply 
packs or containers. More recently, solid detergent blocks 
for institutional washing machines have been developed, 
which have the advantage of being discretely shaped. 
Furthermore, solid detergent blocks can contain more concentrated 
product than the other above-mentioned product 
types. These block form detergent products are generally 
dissolved by simply spraying with water in a dispensing 
device, and then are delivered to the wash liquor. Since 
detergent products which are suitable for use in 
institutional washing machines, often have a high alkali 
content, contact with the skin should be avoided. Block 
form detergent products appear to be very suitable for 
avoiding skin contact. US-A-4,569,781 (Ecolab) describes a detergent container for 
a cast detergent solid suitable for use in dishwashing 
machines. The container contains a detergent product  
 
produced from a melt and allowed to solidify. The detergent 
product is subsequently dissolved from the container on 
contact with a stream of aqueous liquid from a spray means 
when placed in a dispensing device. The advantage of a 
block form detergent product and dispensing device of this 
type is that, with proper handling, contact with the skin 
is virtually eliminated. Owing to the shape thereof, 
however, the container described in this patent has shown 
to leave residues of detergent after emptying by spraying. 
This situation is unacceptable for economic, safety and 
environmental reasons. Detergent residues in the container 
are a potential danger source to the user when a supposedly 
empty container is being replaced by a completely full container. 
Moreover, from an environmental point of view such 
a rigid

A dispensing system comprising a detergent supply pack 
(1) for supplying solid state detergent material to a 

dispensing device (6) associated with a washing machine and 
said dispensing device, which supply pack comprises packaging 

material for said solid state detergent material, 
said solid state detergent material and a closing/release 

device for promoting release of the detergent solid from 
the supply pack into the dispensing device, characterised in that the 

closing/release device comprises at least two movable parts 
(3a,3b) in between which the packaging material is clamped 

and which, after closing,are blocked by locking studs, such 
that the locking studs can be released by placing the supply 

pack on a top centring frame (10) of the dispensing 
device which is used as a key for opening the movable parts 

and introducing the solid detergent into the dispensing 
device. 
Dispensing system according to claim 1, wherein the 
movable parts comprise two doors (3a,3b), which are turnable 

over an angle of at most 90Â° when the locking studs 
are released and the solid detergent is introduced into 

the dispensing device. 
Dispensing system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
top centring frame comprises release knobs and the locking 

studs are release by cooperation with these release knobs 
when placing the supply pack on the centring frame of the 

dispensing device. 
Dispensing system according to any of claims 1-3, 
wherein the movable parts are springloaded and turn almost 

back into their closed position after solid detergent 
material has been introduced into the dispenser.  

 
Dispensing system according to any of claims 1-4, 
whereby the supply pack contains a compacted detergent 

block and comprises packaging material which conforms to 
the shape of the detergent block. 
A dispensing system according to any of claims 1-5, 
wherein the dispensing device is provided with a grid-type 

support (6) with a flexible sealing in the bottom part of 
it on which support the detergent solid is located after it 

is introduced into the device, whereby a spraying nozzle 
(7) is situated underneath the support and the flexible 

sealing is located such that only the bottom part of the 
detergent material is contacted with water. 
Dispensing system according to any of claims 1-6, 
wherein the dispensing device is provided with a top lid 

closure which can be opened only after the height of the 
solid detergent inside the device has decreased t
o below a 
certain level so as to ensure that the device cannot be 

opened just after adding fresh solid detergent material. 
Detergent supply pack which is adapted for use in a 
dispensing system according to any of claims 1-7. 
Dispensing device which is adapted for use in a dispensing 
system according to any of claims 1-7. 
Method of dispensing a solid detergent product into the 
wash liquor to be fed into a washing machine, whereby a 

dispensing system according to any of claims 1-7 is applied.
