<ABSTRACT>
A gas fired boiler arrangement comprises a boiler control arrangement for 
controlling the operation of a gas burner and a pump P which circulates water 

through a heat exchanger heated by the gas burner, the arrangement comprising 
a pair of two-position switches 2,3 which in one position thereof are responsive 

to a demand for heat for causing the gas burner to be ignited and the pump P to 
be operated, and which are responsive to a sensed temperature for causing the 

switches 2,3 to be operated to a second position in which the pump P is operated 
without the gas burner being ignited for pump overrun purposes (Fig. 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas fired boiler arrangements, and is especially 
applicable to gas fired central heating boilers. Most gas fired central heating boilers employ a thermostat to switch the 
gas burner on and off as the outgoing water temperature varies around the 
desired set point. Because of the thermal capacity of the heat exchanger, the 
temperature usually further increases after the shut-down of the burner sometimes 
causing overheating. This potential problem is normally avoided by providing 
a secondary thermostat which maintains the operation of the heating system water 
circulating pump until the temperature has fallen sufficiently. This pump 
continuation feature is commonly known as "pump-overrun". The pump overrun feature also provides a secondary benefit in that it 
usefully extracts the residual heat contained in the heat exchanger for transfer to 
the system water. One problem with such a boiler is that it is necessary to provide two 
thermostats which operate at different temperatures for monitoring the outgoing 
water temperature. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved gas fired 
boiler which obviates the need for a second thermostat. According to the present invention there is provided a gas fired boiler 
arrangement comprising a gas burner, a heat exchanger which is heated by said 
gas burner when said gas burner is ignited, pump means for causing fluid to flow 
through said heat exchanger to be heated thereby, and a boiler control 
arrangement for controlling the operation of said gas burner and said pump, said 
boiler control arrangement comprising switch means having two positions, 
which, in one position thereof is responsive to a demand for heat for causing said 
gas burner to be ignited and said pump means to be operated, and which is 
responsive to a sensed temperature for causing the switch means to assume a 
second position thereof in which said pump means is caused to operate without  
 
said gas burner being ignited for pump overrun purposes. In one preferred arrangement for carrying out the invention it may be 
arranged that said switch means forms part of a thermostatic control in which 
said switch means switches from said one position to said second position in 
response to a first sensed temperature, and switches from said second position 
to said one position in response to a second sensed temperature, said second 
sensed temperature being lower than said first sensed temperature. Advantageously, said switch means comprises a first

A gas fired boiler arrangement comprising a gas burner, a heat 
exchanger which is heated by said gas burner when said gas burner is ignited, 

pump means for causing fluid to flow through said heat exchanger to be heated 
thereby, and a boiler control arrangement for controlling the operation of said 

gas burner and said pump, said boiler control arrangement comprising switch 
means having two positions, which, in one position thereof is responsive to a 

demand for heat for causing said gas burner to be ignited and said pump means 
to be operated, and which is responsive to a sensed temperature for causing the 

switch means to assume a second position thereof in which said pump means is 
caused to operate without said gas burner being ignited for pump overrun 

purposes. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, in which said switch means 
forms part of a thermostatic control in which said switch means switches from 

said one position to said second position in response to a first sensed 
temperature, and switches from said second position to said one position in 

response to a second sensed temperature, said second sensed temperature being 
lower than said first sensed temperature. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2, in which said switch means 

comprises a first two-position switch to which a switched live supply is applied 
corresponding to a call for heat, and which in a de-energised first position of said 

first switch applies said switched live supply to means for causing said burner 
means to be ignited, and in which said switch means comprises a second two-position 

switch which, in a de-energised first position, connects said pump means 
to the switched live supply afforded by said first switch, and which in an 

energised second position thereof connects said pump means to a permanent live 
supply for pump overrun purposes. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, comprising temperature sensing 
means for causing said switch means to be operated to its second position in 

 
response to a predetermined temperature being sensed, and timer means for 

maintaining said switch means in said second position for a predetermined time 
period for causing said pump means to be operated for pump overrun purposes. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 4, comprising power supply 
means which is energised when said pump means is energised and which supplies 

power to said temperature sensing means and said timer means. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5, in which said power supply 
means comprises an isolating transformer, and isolating resistor means are 

provided for electrically isolating said timer means and said temperature sensing 
means. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6, in which said switch 
means comprises a first two-position switch to which a switched live supply is 

applied corresponding to a call for heat, and which in a de-energised first 
position of said first switch applies said switched live supply to said timer means 

and to means for causing said burner means to be ignited, and in which said 
switch means comprises a second two-position switch which, in a de-energised 

first position, connects said pump means and said power supply means to the 
switched live supply afforded by said first switch, and which in an energised 

second position thereof connects said pump means and said power supply means 
to a permanent live supply for pump overrun purposes. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 7, in which said first switch and 
said second switch are constituted by relay contacts of a relay which is operated 

by said temperature sensing means.
