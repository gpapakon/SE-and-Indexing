<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a cooling system for a transmission unit, particularly for reduction gear (2) for driving a sprocket wheel (1) for tracked or wheeled vehicles. The reducer (3) comprises an internal lubrication circuit (10) with forced circulation of a heat-transfer fluid and at least one additional surface (15; 22) for heat-exchange with the external air and means (16, 17, 24, 25) for routing the heat-transfer fluid towards the said heat-exchange surface which is, for example, incorporated into the hub (2) of the sprocket wheel (1) and/or consists of an external radiator (20) fixed to the reducer (2) and possibly equipped with fins (28).

<CLAIMS>
A cooling system for a reduction gear (3) which 
drives a sprocket wheel (1) hub (2) of a tracked or 

wheeled vehicle, the reduction gear (3) comprising an 
internal forced lubricating circuit (10) for a coolant 

fluid, the system comprising at least a first additional 
heat exchange surface (15) integrated into the hub (2) and 

means (16, 17) to channel the coolant fluid between the 
internal circuit (10) and said first additional heat 

exchange surface (15), 
characterized in that
 said means to 
channel the coolant fluid between the internal circuit and 

said first additional heat exchange surface (15) comprise 
piping (16, 17) enabling the fluid to circulate inside the 

hub (2) thereby increasing the contact surface between the 
fluid and the hub (2). 
A cooling system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the first additional heat exchange 

surface (15) is formed by first internal ducts on the 
internal peripheral surface of the hub (2). 
A cooling system according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it comprises a second additional 

heat exchange surface (22) formed by second internal ducts 
of a radiator (20) attached to the reduction element (3) 

integral with the hub (2) and communicating with the 
lubricating circuit (10) of the reduction gear (3). 
A cooling system according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the first internal ducts and/or the 

second internal ducts (15, 22) are formed by ring-shaped 
grooves, a threading, and ribs or analogous devices. 
A cooling system according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the external surface of the radiator 

(20) is fitted with fins (28). 
A cooling system according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the fins (28) are arranged in a 

perpendicular plane to the rotational axis of the sprocket 
wheel (1).  

 
A cooling system according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the fins (28) are arranged in a 

plane passing by the rotational axis of the sprocket wheel 
(1).
