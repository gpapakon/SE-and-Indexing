<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to outdoor cooking 
devices and incinerators. Ever since the discovery of fire man has tried many 
ways of harnessing its power through the utilisation of 
more or less elaborate apparatus and systems. Nowhere is 
this more evident than in the field of cookery and in 
particular in the design of barbecues and other outdoor 
cooking devices. Their dimensions, non-complexity, 
portability, efficiency and economy have all been present 
in the minds of those that have directed their attention to 
the finding of novel and better solutions to the problems 
associated with such devices in the past. Typical of these problems are those of protecting the 
burning fuel against winds, avoiding burning or charring 
the food to be grilled, and enabling the utilisation of an 
economical fuel. Additional to these problems is the fact 
that barbecues and other outdoor cooking devices are 
typically of a bulky construction and so may take up 
valuable storage space when not in use. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided an outdoor cooking device or incinerator 
for confining a fuel to be burnt that when assembled 
comprises a base and one or more side walls extending 
upwardly from said base characterised in that said base and 
side walls comprise a plurality of sections which can be 
separated or moved relative to each other for storage in a 
nested configuration. Advantageously said plurality of sections may include 
a base portion comprising a base and one or more side walls 
extending upwardly from said base and at least one 
open-ended member, the base portion being so sized to be 
capable of receipt within said open-ended member. 
Preferably the outdoor cooking device or incinerator may 
include two open-ended members, one of said open-ended 
members being so sized as to be capable of receiving said 
base portion and to be itself received within the other of  
 
said open-ended members. Advantageously each of said plurality of sections may 
comprise the same number of side walls as each of the other 
of said plurality of sections. Advantageously said plurality of sections are 
assembled one on top of the other. Advantageously said plurality of sections may each be 
provided with one of a respective pair of interengaging 
formations. Preferably said interengaging formations may 
comprise an edge of one of said sections which is adapted 
for receipt within a rim of another of said sections. Advantageously said plurality of sections may be 
assembled in

said base, characterised in that said base and side walls 

comprise a plurality of sections which can be separated or 
moved relative to each other for storage in a nested 

cofiguration. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with claim 1, wherein said plurality of sections 

include a base portion comprising a base and one or more 
side walls extending upwardly from said base and at least 

one open-ended member, the base portion being so sized as 
to be capable of receipt within said open-ended member. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with claim 2 and including two open-ended 

members, one of said open-ended members being so sized as 
to be capable of receiving said portion and to be itself 

received within the other of said open-ended members. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with claim 2 or claim 3, wherein each of said 

plurality of sections comprises the same number of side 
walls as each of the other of said plurality of sections. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with any preceding claim, wherein said plurality 

of sections are assembled one on top of the other.

accordance with any preceding claim wherein said plurality 

of sections are each provided with one of a respective pair 
of interengaging formations. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
 

accordance with claim 6, wherein said interengaging 
formations comprise an edge of one of said sections which 

is adapted for receipt within a rim of another of said 
sections. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with any preceding claim, wherein said plurality 

of sections are assembled in such a way that in 
cross-section the corresponding side walls of each of said 

sections extend rectilinearly of each other. 
An outdoor cooking device or incinerator in 
accordance with any preceding claim, wherein each of said 

plurality of sections is of substantially inverted 
frustro-conical shape.
