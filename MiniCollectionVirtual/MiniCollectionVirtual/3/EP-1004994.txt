<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field of merchandise sales and, in particular, to business methods and devices for the sale of merchandise.It is well known that the sale of merchandise, such as jewelry and other items of value, typically are sold in either specialty stores, such as jewelry stores, for instance, or other stores which typically are equipped with special safety devices for safeguarding the merchandise. Oftentimes, such stores typically possess a sophisticated and elegant appearance that tends to attract a certain type of customer, i.e., a customer with relatively large purchasing power. Such an appearance, however, also may inhibit the attraction of other customers, i.e., customers with average purchasing power. Due to the current stability in the value of gold and precious stones, the aforementioned "average purchasing power" customer may possess the ability to purchase merchandise, such as jewelry, and other "high-end" merchandise; however, as mentioned hereinbefore, the tendency of such customers to avoid jewelry stores and the like has, heretofore, tended to limit the sale of such merchandise.While the "traditional" jewelry store method of merchandising arguably has some beneficial results, such as by providing increased security of the displayed merchandise, this method also tends to negatively affect the sale of less expensive and, thus more customer-accessible merchandise that could easily be purchased by a larger group of customers. Because of this, customer-accessible merchandise typically has been purchased by customers at a rate which is less than the rate desired by the producers of such merchandise.Therefore, there is a need for improved methods, and devices for implementing such methods, that address these and other shortcomings of the prior art.A monitoring system for monitoring a vending machine is known from US Patent US 5,091,713. The vending machine includes means for securely storing and displaying products, means for providing access to the products stored and displayed and means for remotely monitoring transactions occuring at the vending machine.A sales point unit for use in displaying and storing merchandise is known from French Patent FR 2 650 099. The sales point unit includes means for securely storing and displaying merchandise, means for providing access to the merchandise stored and displayed within the sales point unit and means for remotely monitoring transactions occurring at the sales point unit. The means for providing access to the
