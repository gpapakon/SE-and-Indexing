<ABSTRACT>
A method for inserting a paper strip (P) between the layers of a strip (m) 
wound around a winding reel (10) of a carrousel type winding apparatus (9) 

provided at the exit of metallic strip continuous processing line. The method 
includes the steps of advancing the paper (P) discharged from a paper strip 

coil (24) located above a carrousel type winding apparatus (9) in a downward 
direction; shifting a paper feeding direction to a horizontal plane; and 

inserting the paper strip (P) through an entrance of a winding reel (10). 
An apparatus for performing this method includes a continuous paper feeding 

apparatus (20) disposed near a winding carrousel type winding apparatus (9); 
a paper feeding direction changing apparatus (40) disposed at an entrance 

of the winding reel (10); and a paper shear (29). The continuous paper 
feeding apparatus (20) includes two or more paper unwinders (22a,b); a paper 

bonding device (28) which bonds a paper (P) discharged from one 
paper-discharging unwinder (22a,b) to a paper on another idle paper unwinder 

(22a,b); and a paper cutter (29) for cutting the discharged paper (P) when 
the papers (P) are bonded together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper inserting method 
and system which are capable of inserting a paper strip 
between layers of cold-rolled stainless steel strip being 
wound and coiled on a metallic strip continuous processing 
line, such as a continuous tandem cold rolling line, without 
interrupting the line operation, to prevent occurrence of 
marring on the surface of the steel strip. Conventionally, a strip, such as cold rolled stainless 
steel, the surface quality and gloss of which are regarded as 
important has been produced by a reverse rolling method in 
which the material is reverse rolled many times using a 
Sendzmir mill equipped with multi-stage rolls or by a tandem 
rolling method in which the material is continuously rolled by 
multiple Sendzmir mills arranged in tandem. However, 
production is restricted because the roll overheats due to the 
roll diameter being as small as 50 - 120 mm resulting in 
frequent replacement of the roll. For this reason, to improve the productivity of the 
strip, for example, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.3-47928 
and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.4-52005 and 52009 have 
disclosed a rolling method using a tandem rolling mill in 
which multiple units of large-diameter rolling mills for 
making normal steel are arranged. According to the rolling method using the tandem rolling 
mill for carbon steel, large-diameter work rolls about 250 - 
650 mm in diameter are used, thus the method (1) secures a 
great reduction rate because the strength is high, (2) 
realizes effective roll cooling because the roll surface area 
is large, (3) has a roll service life five or six times longer  
 
than when using small diameter rolls, and (4) ensures 
excellent feeding performance of the leading edge of the 
strip, thereby securing a high rolling speed. The continuous 
tandem cold rolling mill continuously rolls material without a 
stoppage, thus there is no off-gauging due to stopping 
operation of the rolling mill. Therefore, this rolling mill 
can be expected to improve productivity and yield a great 
rate. Further, as described in Japanese Patent Examined 
Publication No.3-47928, a large-diameter roll retards the 
unevenness of the raw material surface from being transferred 
to the finished strip during cold rolling, thereby obtaining a 
product with an excellent surface. A typical example of a fully continuous tandem cold 
rolling mill will be described with reference to Fig. 25. 
After a strip is unwound from a coil on a pay-off reel, a
