<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an X-ray diagnostic device for producing X-rays of body parts of a patient, in which a line detector camera (4) is arranged diametrically opposite a radiation source (3) and comprises an X-ray detector (35) arranged behind a slot-shaped opening (18) and whose width is adapted to the width or length of the body part to be imaged. Furthermore, there are adjustment means (D1, D4) which adjust the line detector camera relative to the body part in such a way that the slot-shaped opening is moved along the body part. The fan beam delimited by the diaphragm (52, 12) of the radiation source (3) is moved along synchronously to the camera movement. The line detector camera can be arranged horizontally or vertically.

Radiodiagnostics device for producing
panoramic tomograms of the jaw of a patient,

cephalometric radiograms or mammograms of a patient,
using a line-detector camera (4), which is arranged

diametrically opposite a radiation source (3) and is
mounted close to the patient for producing panoramic

tomograms and mammograms and is mounted at a distance
from the patient for producing the cephalometric

radiograms and contains an X-ray detector (35), which
is arranged behind a slit-like opening (18) and the

width of which is matched to the width or length of the
part of the body that is to be radiographed, with there

being adjusting means (D1, D4) which adjust the line-detector
camera with respect to the part of the body in

such a way that the slit opening is moved along the
part of the body, the fan-shaped ray, which is

delimited by the radiation diaphragm (52, 12) of the
radiation source (3), being moved synchronously with

the camera movement, and in which there are provided
holding devices (15) for the line-detector camera (4)

that are constructed identically for the different
radiograms mentioned above.
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 1,
in which the line-detector camera (4) is held in such a

way that the slit opening (18) extends horizontally and
the adjusting movement takes place in the vertical

direction (Figure 2).
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 2,
in which there is allocated to the line-detector camera

(4) a wall adapter, which contains adjusting means for
a vertical adjustment of a holder for the camera.
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 2,
in which there is allocated to the line-detector camera

(4) a cantilever arm (6) which is held in a vertically
adjustable manner on a stand (1) which supports the 

radiation source (3) (Figure 2).
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 1,
in which, for cephalometric radiograms, the line-detector

camera (4) is held in such a way that the slit
opening (18) extends vertically and the adjusting

movement takes place in the horizontal direction.
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 5,
in which the radiation source (3) is fixed and the

primary diaphragm (52) connected in front of it is
adjusted synchronously with the adjustment of the

camera.
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 5,
in which the radiation source (3) is arranged so as to

be adjustable, and is arranged in a manner such that,
together with the primary diaphragm (52), it is

adjustable about the centre of rotation (54) of a
rotation unit (2) which supports the radiation source.
Radiodiagnostics device according to one of
the claims 1 to 7, which, in order to produce panoramic

tomograms (PAN radiograms) of the jaw of a patient on
the one hand and tele-radiograms (ceph-radiograms) of

the skull of a patient on the other hand, contains the
following elements:


a stand (1) having a vertically adjustable
supporting portion (1a);
a rotation unit (2) having an X-ray source (3)
and a first head-supporting and positioning device (5);
a first holder (15) for a line-detector camera
(4) for producing the PAN radiograms;
a cantilever arm (6), on which there is arranged
a second head-supporting and positioning device (7);

and also
a second holder (15) having an identically
constructed connecting piece (24) for the alternative

holding device of the above-mentioned line-detector
camera (4) for producing the ceph-radiograms,
 
with the first holder being arranged in such a way

that the line detector is oriented in a manner such
that its longitudinal extent is vertical and can be

moved together with the radiation source (3) about the
head of the patient, while the second holder is

arranged in such a way that the line-detector camera is
oriented in a manner such that its longitudinal extent

is horizontal and is arranged so as to be adjustable in
the vertical plane with respect to the radiation

source.
Radiodiagnostics device according to claim 8,
in which the second head-supporting and positioning

device (7) is fastened on a stationary portion (wall)
outside the device and the line-detector camera (4) is

fastened on the vertically adjustable cantilever arm
(6).
