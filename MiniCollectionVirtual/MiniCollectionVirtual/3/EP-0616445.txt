symbols, each of the said first data symbols being
formed of a plurality (51) of orthogonal carrier

frequencies each modulated by a data element of a
first source signal, and
first means (48) of transmission ensuring the
modulation of the said first data symbols at a

first modulation frequency (f

broadcasting of the modulated symbols with the aid

of at least a first antenna;

in that each of the said base stations (12
i

second means (22, 24, 26) of channel coding
delivering a second series of second successive

data symbols, each of the said second data symbols
being formed of a plurality of orthogonal carrier

frequencies (31) each modulated by a data element
of a second source signal, and
second means (28) of transmission ensuring the
modulation of the said second data symbols at a

second modulation frequency (f
2

and in that each of the said base stations (12
i

81) cooperates with at least two spatially distributed

hertzian transmission and reception units (13

bidirectional manner to the said base station,

in such a way that a signal emanating from the said
base station is transmitted to the said mobile stations

by each of the said units, and that a signal received
by the said base station corresponds to the sum of the

signals received by each of the said units.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said signal received by the said base station

(12
i

comprising a predetermined number of first data

symbols, each frame being partitioned into time
intervals (I
i
) each comprising at least one data symbol,
and in that at least one time interval (I
i
) is assigned
to each of the said mobiles (15
i
; 220; 419
i
; 66; 71
i
,
72, 77
i

the time intervals assigned to it.
System according to either one of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the said signal emanating from

each of the said base stations (12

instant of transmission (423) of the said first

symbols, as a function of the said synchronization data
(422).
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that a guard interval (32; 52) is

contrived between each of the said first data symbols,
so as to absorb the synchronization gaps between two

mobile stations.
