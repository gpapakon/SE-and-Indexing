<ABSTRACT>
The cutting machine according to the invention
comprises a frame (11) supporting at one end (11.1) a drive

unit (12) with a stationary drive pulley (12.1) turned by a
motor/gearbox assembly (12.2). Two idle deflection pulleys

(13) are able to travel along respective straight rails (14)
fixed to the frame (11). Each deflection pulley (13) is

mounted on its own motorized carriage (13.1), which is able
to move along the corresponding rail (14). To make the cut,

the frame (11) is placed with the drive unit (12) in a
proximal position to the material to be cut. A diamond wire

(17) is introduced into holes specially made in the material
and is formed into an endless loop, running it partly around

the drive pulley (12.1), and deflecting it around the
deflection pulleys (13), while correct tension is applied to

it; the motor/gearbox assembly (12.2) is then turned, and
with it the drive pulley (12.1), which sets the diamond wire

(17) running, which wire, as it cuts its way through the
material, tends to slacken, but is maintained at tension by

moving at least one of the deflection pulleys (13) in such a
way as to take up the excess length of wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diamond-wire
cutting machine for cutting stone in quarries or reinforced
concrete on construction sites and the like.Cutting machines of the type indicated are used in
quarries for making primary cuts, for example on granite and
marble, and for squaring blocks of stone, while on
construction sites they can be used for demolishing
reinforced concrete.Known cutting machines comprise a robust carriage
structure with driving wheels to propel the machine backwards
or forwards along fixed straight tracks for both positioning
and working. The carriage supports a unit carrying a
flywheel, the translational movement and rotation through
360° of which are effected by electric motors. A diamond
cutting wire with a length of e.g. 20-80 m is partially wound
in an endless loop around the flywheel, is guided by a pair
of fixed idle pulleys whose axes are parallel with that of
the flywheel and adjacent to it on opposite sides relative to
its axis, and is fed through the material to be cut, for
example through specially made holes. It is thus possible to
cut the material on a plane containing the loop of diamond
wire. To this end, during the working phase, while the
diamond wire is being run around the flywheel and is
executing the cut, the carriage reverses along the tracks to
maintain the constant and correct tensioning of the wire,
whose excess length is thus taken up in step with the depth
of the cut executed.However, known diamond-wire cutting machines have the
following principal disadvantages:
they occupy a large amount of space;during cutting it is practically impossible to protect
the diamond wire as it is taken up, which remains exposed;to operate they require a travelway formed of fixed
tracks at least equal in length to half the length of the
diamond-wire to be taken up during the cut; during the cut, their diamond wire has poor grip on the
flywheel; andon start-up, the pressure exerted by the diamond wire on
the material to be cut is too great.The present invention notes these disadvantages and
seeks to provide a solution to them.The principal object of the present invention is
therefore to provide a diamond-wire cutting machine for
cutting stone in quarries or reinforced concrete on
construction sites and the like, that occupies little space,
enables at least a substantial proportion of the diamond wire
taken up during the cut to be protected, and that does not
require the use of a travelway whose length is at least equal
to half the length of the diamond wire to be taken

<CLAIMS>
Diamond-wire cutting machine for cutting stone in
quarries or reinforced concrete on construction sites and the

like, characterized in that it comprises a supporting
structure which is essentially a flat frame (11) supporting

at one end (11.1) a drive unit (12) that includes a
stationary drive pulley (12.1), whose axis is essentially

perpendicular to the plane in which the frame itself lies and
which is rotated by a motor/gearbox assembly (12.2), together

with two idle deflection pulleys (13) these being located in
a plane essentially parallel with the plane containing the

said drive pulley (12.1), having their axes essentially
parallel with the axis of the said pulley and being able to

travel along respective straight rails (14) fixed to the said
frame (11), each travelling deflection pulley (13) being

mounted on its own motorized carriage (13.1), which travels
in both directions along the corresponding rail (14), the

latter being in the form of, for example, a monorail, so that
in order to make the cut the said frame (11) is placed with

its end (11.1) carrying the drive unit (12) in a proximal
position to the material to be cut, in which, if necessary,

suitable holes have been prepared for a diamond wire (17) to
pass through, the wire then being introduced into these holes

and formed into an endless loop, running it partly around the
said drive pulley (12.1) and deflecting it around the said

travelling deflection pulleys (13), while correct tension is
applied to it; the cutting operation is then commenced by

turning the said motor/gearbox assembly (12.2) and with it
the said drive pulley (12.1), which sets the diamond wire

(17) running, which wire, as it cuts its way through the
material, tends to slacken, but is maintained at the correct

tension by moving at least one of the said travelling
deflection pulleys (13) a corresponding amount, on its

supporting carriage (13.1), towards the distal end of the
corresponding rail (14) from the said end (11.1) of the frame

(11), thereby taking up the excess length of wire.
Cutting machine according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the translation along its rail (14) of the carriage

(13.1) of each travelling deflection pulley (13) is
independent of the translation of the other carriage.
Cutting machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it comprises, to guide the diamond wire

(17), two idle pulleys (15) supported with respect to the
said end (11.1) and on the outside of the said supporting

frame (11), on opposite sides of and with axes essentially
parallel to the axis of the said drive pulley (12.1), the

said guide pulleys (15) being in a plane essentially parallel
with the plane containing the said drive pulley (12.1).
Cutting machine according to Claim 3, characterized
in that each guide pulley (15) is supported on one end of a

rod (16.1) of a corresponding actuator (16) whose cylinder is
attached to the said end (11.1) of the frame (11), in such a

way that the said guide pulleys (15) determine the distance,
in an essentially radial direction, of the diamond wire (17)

on either side, from the axis of the said drive pulley
(12.1), within the range of extension of the rods (16.1) of

the respective actuators (16).
Cutting machine according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the said supporting

frame (11) is provided with adjustable feet (18) to enable it
to stand on the ground, as for example when cutting in planes

approximately parallel with the ground.
Cutting machine according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises a rotary

supporting device (19) comprising a spindle and a thrust
bearing, mounted centrally with respect to the said

supporting frame (11), so that the said machine can be
operationally mounted detachably and 360°-rotatably on a

quarry or site vehicle (leveller truck R).
Cutting machine according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the said thrust bearing of the rotary supporting

device (19) is mounted detachably on a carrier frame (T)
supported by pivoting arms (B1, B2) in a quarry or site

vehicle (leveller truck R), in such a way that it is possible
to move the cutting machine (10) both during cutting and at

rest, and to position it where it can execute cuts - by way
of example in essentially vertical or horizontal planes - by

orienting the said carrier frame (T) by using the said arms
(B1, B2) as required.
Cutting machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is provided with a

protective housing that largely surrounds the said supporting
frame (11) with its pulleys (12.1, 13, 15), thereby

protecting the diamond wire (17) as it is taken up during
cutting.
