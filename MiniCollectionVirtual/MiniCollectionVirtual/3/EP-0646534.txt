<ABSTRACT>
Elongated objects are aligned by being placed on a vibratory 
grid (1) having elongated holes arranged parallel to one another and 

to the direction of advance (A) and removal of the aligned objects. 
They drop through the grid (1) onto conveying means (2) which then moves 

them away in the desired direction of removal. This removal on 
the conveying means (2) can be relatively fast. Desirably the 

vibratory grid (1) is in the form of a number of parallel but spaced 
round bars which quickly and effectively align the elongated 

objects as they pass down through the spaces between the bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the aligning, or "laning" as it
is often called, of elongated objects. In particular, the
invention relates to a laning apparatus and method for aligning
such elongated materials.When objects are to be sorted or checked, if they are
elongated in one dimension it is highly desirable that they all
be aligned in the same general direction, e.g. with their
elongated axes parallel. This is particularly the case when such
objects need to be sorted and defective objects rejected.The invention is particularly, although not exclusively,
useful in relation to objects which are substantially cylindrical
and, in particular, of an elongated cylindrical nature, such as
sausages. However, the objects need not be truly cylindrical and
more conically shaped objects such as carrots can also equally
be aligned by adopting the principles of the invention.Presently known systems use a vibratory conveyor on to which
such objects are dropped, and their alignment is achieved by
providing within the top surfaces of the conveyor, grooves which
extend lengthwise in the direction of advance of the conveyor.
The elongated objects then progressively align themselves and
drop into these grooves as they advance along the vibratory
conveyor.The problem with such a simple arrangement however is its
overall capacity. Thus the speed of advance of a vibratory
conveyor is relatively low and is in any case limited by the
necessity to allow quite a long length of conveyor or, in other 
words, time for the objects to become aligned and to fit into the
elongated grooves. In practice, this means that one needs to use
a very wide vibratory tray to cope with the amount of material
to be laned, but even then there are problems in that sometimes
the objects lay upon one another in the grooves, known as a
double stacking problem, and in any case the speed of advance is
still very slow.To overcome the problem of double stacking, it is normal to
have a number of vibratory conveyors, usually three, positioned
one after the other with the aligned objects from the first
conveyor falling on to the second, and from the second on to the
third, the hope and expectation here being that eventually along
the overall length of the combined conveyor, the double stacking
will be avoided because at some stage, a second or third item
laying on a first will fall back and rest at the bottom of a
groove on its own. Such an arrangement can reduce or avoid
double stacking but does nothing to increase the speed of
sorting.Attempts to increase the

Apparatus for aligning elongated objects comprising an
upper vibratory grid (1) having a direction of advance of objects

placed on it and having elongated openings arranged substantially
parallel to one another and to the direction of advance and

removal of the aligned objects, and beneath that vibratory grid,
conveyor means (2) including means for retaining the objects in their aligned

orientation, for removing the objects from beneath the grid (1)
in a direction substantially parallel to the aligned orientation

of such objects achieved as they fall through the elongated
openings in the grid onto the conveyor means, the conveyor means

(2) being arranged to remove the aligned objects from beneath the
vibrating grid (1) at a higher linear speed than the speed of

advance on the vibratory grid.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 in which the vibratory grid
is made up of a number of parallel spaced bars (1), the elongated

openings being defined between adjacent pairs of bars.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 in which the bars (1) are
rounded in cross-section.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the
vibratory grid advances the objects in a direction opposite to

the direction of the conveyor means (2), a reject bin at the end
of the grid (1) being provided for objects too large or distorted

to fit the elongated openings.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the
conveyor means comprise a plurality of pairs of spaced parallel

endless bands (2a).
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which a
second conveyor means working at a higher linear speed than the

first conveyor means (2) is provided so as to space out the
objects further in the direction of advance. 
A method of aligning elongated objects in which they are
subjected to vibration on a vibratory grid (1) such that the objects are advanced on the grid, the grid having elongated

openings substantially parallel to one another and to the direction of advance and intended
direction of alignment of the objects, and the objects drop

through those elongated openings as and when they achieve an
appropriate alignment onto conveyor means (2) which retain the

objects in their aligned orientation and remove them in the
direction of their alignment from beneath the vibratory grid (1)

at a higher linear speed than the speed of advance on the
vibratory grid.
A method as claimed in Claim 7 in which the conveyor means
(2) moves at a linear speed of at least 0.5m/s.
A method as claimed in Claim 8 in which the conveyor means
(2) moves at a linear speed of at least 3m/s.
A method as claimed in any of claims 7 to 9 in which the
conveyor means (2) comprises a plurality of pairs of spaced

parallel endless bands (2a), one pair beneath respective
elongated opening in the vibratory grid (1) so that objects

aligned by dropping through the elongated opening, rest on and
between the respective pair of bands and so are retained in that

alignment by the bands.
A method as claimed in any of claims 7 to 10 in which the
direction of advance o
f the objects over the vibratory grid (1)
is opposite to the direction of removal of the conveyor means

(2).
A method as claimed in any of claims 7 to 11 in which a
second conveyor means is provided which operates at a higher

linear speed than the first conveyor means (2), the objects being
passed from the first conveyor means (2) to the second conveyor

means to space them further in the direction of advance of the
conveyor means.
