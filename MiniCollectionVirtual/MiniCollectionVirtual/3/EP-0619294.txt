<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 1-phenoxy-2-aminopropane represented by general formula (II), (wherein R represents hydrogen 
or C₁-C₆ alkyl, and n represents 0 or an integer from 1 to 5) in a high yield at a high selectivity by reacting 

1-methyl-2-phenoxyethanol represented by general formula (I), (wherein R and n are each as defined above) with ammonia in 
the presence of a copper-chromium catalyst and hydrogen in a solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of 1-phenoxy-2-aminopropane useful as an intermediate 
for triazine herbicides. As a triazine herbicide, JP-A-63-264465 discloses a 
triazine herbicide in which a (3,5-dimethylphenoxy)-alkylamino 
group is substituted on a triazine ring, as is represented by the 
formula, 
The above Japanese Publication describes that the above 
triazine herbicide has remarkable advantages in that it is not 
only excellent in herbicidal activity but also free of 
phytotoxicity to paddy rice. According to the above Publication, the above 
(3,5-dimethylphenoxy)alkylamino group-substituted triazine 
herbicide is obtained by reacting 
1-(3,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane with 
2-amino-4,6-dihalotriazine. It is also described that the 
1-(3,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane used in the above reaction 
is obtained by reacting (3,5-dimethylphenoxy)acetone with sodium 
cyanoborohydride in methanol in the presence of ammonium acetate 
(this process will be referred to as Conventional Process I). 
Conventional Process I is represented by the following scheme.  
 
However, the defect with the above Conventional Process 
I is that the yield of 1-(3,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane as 
the intended compound is very low, as low as about 30 %. Meanwhile, as a process for the production of 
1-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane which is a structural 
isomer of 1-(3,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane, Polish 
Laid-open Patent Publication No. 142711 discloses a process in 
which 1-methyl-2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)ethanol is reacted with 
ammonia in the presence of a copper-nickel catalyst and hydrogen, 
as is shown in the following scheme (this process will be 
referred to as Conventional Process 2). 
However, the defect with Conventional Process 2 is that 
since a large amount of 2,6-xylenol is formed as a byproduct in 
addition to 1-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-2-aminopropane, the 
selectivity to the intended compound is low. For example, in 
Example 6 of the above Polish Publication, the byproduct 
(2,6-xylenol) is formed in an amount of as much as 25 % and the 
yield of the intended compound is 58 %, so that the selectivity 
to the intended compound is as low as 70 %. Chemical abstracts, 1988, 109, n.233141f discloses a process for the 
synthesis of 1-phenoxy-2-aminopropane of the present formula (II) which 
comprises reacting 1-methyl-2-phenoxyethanol of the present formula (I) 
with ammonia in the presence of a copper-chromium catalyst and hydrogen. As explained above,'there
