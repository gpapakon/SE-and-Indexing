<ABSTRACT>
An Event Driven Interface (EDI) is disclosed for use as a 
subsystem of a monitoring and control system for a data 

communications network. The network communicates a serial 
stream of binary bits having a characteristic pattern. The 

system includes a control vector generator for generating a 
control vector C(i) which describes the characteristic pattern 

and an event vector analyzer for analyzing an event vector 
E(i) which represents a plurality of occurrences of the 

pattern on the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to the extraction 
of information from large bodies of data for high speed 
communication facilities. This invention is particularly well 
suited to the extraction of information which characterizes 
complex data communications networks. With the advent of FDDI, BISDN, and SONET, the day of 
gigabit computer communications network is here, and the day 
of the terabit network is fast approaching. These high speed 
network environments demand new and powerful tools that 
require information from the network to assist with network 
design, network management, network control functions, and 
network services. One extremely important problem to solve is 
how to monitor the raw data from one or more high speed 
communications channels and convert the data to useful 
"information," for a user, a service, input to an algorithm 
whenever it is required, etc. Previously, this problem has 
been viewed to be that of "real-time" network monitoring and 
performance evaluation. Network monitoring is defined as the 
extraction, processing, collection, and presentation of 
dynamic information with respect to the operation of a system. 
Monitoring information is then used by network performance 
management (usually an individual) to evaluate the state of 
network resources in real-time (usually via some type of 
display). Involvement by high skilled individuals, 
unfortunately, is required by the present day 
state-of-the-art.  Data collection requires the accumulation of information 
relevant to its use. Two approaches for network data 
collection are typically used: 
1. Tracing an recording the actual data. The term "trace" 
refers to a record of all frames and bytes transmitted on 
a network, as well as environmental information. Two 
examples of environmental information include time stamps 
and control block information. A trace usually provides 
a complete picture of time dependent network behavior. 2. Collecting statistical information only. Statistical 
information is parametric information that is usable in 
mathematical models for performance evaluation. Unlike 
trace data that keeps track of all information 
transmitted and relative timing information, statistical 
information is obtained by categorizing the data and 
keeping counters for each category. For example, we 
could categorize frames by frame length and count the 
number of frames of a particular length within a given 
time interval. Statistical approaches are not flexible 
and are typically geared to one
