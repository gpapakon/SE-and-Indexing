<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cosmetic applicators 
comprising absorbent sheets impregnated with an oil-in-water 
emulsion incorporating various cleansing and 
moisturizing agents which are particularly adapted to the 
effective cleansing and moisturizing of skin. These 
emulsions may also contain antimicrobial agents exhibiting 
activity against the causative organisms associated with 
diaper rash. It has been shown that the most effective way of 
preventing diaper rash is to cleanse the skin thoroughly 
and to remove the microorganisms that have been identified 
as causative. The source of these microorganisms is often 
the fecal deposits that can remain on a baby's skin while 
wearing the diaper. Because fecal deposits consist of 
both water-soluble and oil-soluble matter, however, 
complete removal of fecal deposits from the diaper area 
requires both water-based and oil-based cleansing agents. 
Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide a 
mechanism for cleansing babies' skin in order both to 
remove waste deposits and to reduce the number of 
microorganisms available to cause infection. A variety of treated cloths which are adapted for 
skin washing and cleansing are commercially available. 
Such products are composed of paper or non-woven fabric 
sheets which are wetted with an aqueous solution of water 
soluble or water dispersible ingredients. To cleanse skin 
thoroughly, both water soluble and oil soluble cleansing  
 
agents should be incorporated. Incorporating water-insoluble 
cosmetic ingredients in the form of an oil-in-water 
emulsion has been described in U.S. Patent 4,559,157 
granted Dec. 17, 1985 to Smith et al., "Cosmetic 
Applicator Useful for Skin Moisturizing". However, these prior-art emulsions are not very 
acceptable in that (1) they possess significant viscosity 
(1300 - 2000 cPs), which makes them difficult to use and 
which result in the emulsion remaining on the cloth rather 
than transferring to the baby's skin; or, (2) in cases 
where viscosity has been reduced, the compositions tend to 
be unstable. Thus, it has been difficult to make stable 
compositions that are low in viscosity and therefore 
acceptable for use on a cleansing cloth or wipe. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to 
provide a cosmetic applicator containing both water-soluble 
and water-insoluble cleansing agents and an 
antimicrobial agent, incorporated over and above the 
requirements for adequately preserving the product, which 
exhibits activity against the microorganisms that have 
bee
