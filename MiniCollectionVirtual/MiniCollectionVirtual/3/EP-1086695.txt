<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to the use of yohimbine as acitve principle for the preparation of therapeutic compositions with antiviral activity.
The invention also refers to the use of
pharmacologically acceptable yohimbine salts for the preparation of
pharmaceutical compositions having antiviral activity.Yohimbine (C21H26N2O3, methyl 17-alpha-hydroxy-20-alpha-yohimban-16-beta-carboxylate,
m.p. 243-244Â°C) is an indole alkylamine alkaloid contained in the
bark of Pausinystalia johimbe, a tree belonging to the Rubiaceae family, in the
bark of Corynanthe johimbe and Pseudocinchona johimbe, as well as in the root of
Rauwolfia serpentina, from the alcoholic extract of which it has been isolated
together with other alkaloids similar to it as regards chemical composition
(Chatterjee, Experientia, Vol. X/6 246-247 (1954). The use of yohimbine as a drug
has been known (R. Benigni et al., PIANTE MEDICINALI - Chimica, Farmacologia,
Terapia, Vol. II - Inverni della Beffa, Milano 1964) since last century both as a
vasodilator and, at high doses, as a vasoconstrictor. Its activity on the vascular
system has been amply described, and the specificity of action of yohimbine, its
pharmacological kinetics, as well as its selectivity towards alpha2-adrenergic
receptors, make it the ideal instrument in pharmacological dissections for the
study of animal and human physiology, as well as for the study of the mechanism
of action of other active principles, in particular anaesthetics and
antihypertensives. It is used in the treatment of impotence on an organic basis.
Yohimbine hydrochloride has moreover been successfully employed in the
treatment of the sequelae of surgical operations on the abdomen (intestinal
atony).WO 98/29101 discloses that glutathione or a glutathione derivative has potential
for the treatment of impotence and may also be co-administered with yohimbine,
providing synergistic effect. In a large study, I.T. Kusumoto et al. (Shoyakugaku Zasshi, 1991, 45/3 240-254)
tested flavonoids and alkaloids on reverse transcriptase and concluded that, of the
alkaloids tested, isoquinoline alkaloids and other alkaloids including indol (among
which yohimbine), steroidal, quinolizilidine, pyridine and imidazole alkaloids
containing no quaternary nitrogen did not show any significant reverse trancriptase
activity.In another study, B.Alarcon et al. (Antiviral Research 1984, 4, 231-143) carried out
a screening of a number of compounds for antiherpes activity and found that
yohimbine hydrocloride proved inactive against HSV-1
