<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to alkaline photoresist
stripping compositions containing reducing agents and the use
of such stripping compositions to reduce or inhibit metal
corrosion and/or metal loss when stripping photoresists from
substrates containing metals such as tungsten and/or copper
and its alloys with aluminum.With reference to EP 93 11 7966.7 which forms part of the state of the art persuant to Art 54(3) and (4) EPC applicant submitted separate claims for
contracting states DE, IE, IT, NL and CH/LI.An integral part of microelectronic fabrication is
the use of photoresists to transfer an image from a mask or
reticle to the desired substrate circuit layer. After the
desired image transfer has been achieved, the photoresist is
removed, that is, stripped from the substrate before
proceeding to some subsequent process step. Starting around
1980, amides and mixtures of amides with various co-solvents
have routinely been used for this stripping step, see for
example Ward et al., U.S. 4,395,479; U.S. 4,428,871 and U.S.
4,401,748.Depending on the type of processing that is
performed while the photoresist is in place on the substrate,
the photoresist polymer may be cross-linked or hardened to the
extent that amide-based solvents will no longer effectively
strip the photoresist. Starting around 1985, the use of amide
mixtures containing additional alkaline components, such as
organic amines, (see Johnson U.S. 4,592,787; Merrem U.S.
4,765,844; Sizensky U.S. 4,617,251; Turner WO 87/05314 and
Thomas et al. U.S. 4,791,043) or quaternary ammonium 
hydroxides (see Steppan et al. U.S. 4,776,892; Haq U.S.
4,744,834; Martin WO 88/05813) was introduced to facilitate
the removal of such hardened photoresists.The use of these alkaline components in strippers on
microcircuits containing metals, particularly tungsten or
copper and its alloys with aluminum, can lead to metal loss.
Various types of metal corrosion, such as for example
corrosion whiskers, pitting and notching of metal lines, have
been observed during the use of these alkaline strippers. In
the case of tungsten and copper corrosion can occur in the
heated dry organic stripping composition mixtures with
dissolved oxygen providing the cathodic reaction.It would therefore be most desirable to be able to
provide alkaline-containing photoresist stripping compositions
suitable for stripping cross-linked or hardened photoresist
polymer from substrates containing metal in which metal
corrosion and/or metal loss is reduced or inhibited. A
