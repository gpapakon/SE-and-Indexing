<ABSTRACT>
The invention is related to a capacitive transducer feedback-controlled 
by means of electrostatic force and a method for 

controlling said transducer. The transducer comprises a body 
part (8) supporting a dynamically moving transducing element 

sensitive to the variable being measured, said transducing 
element being, e.g., a diaphragm (9) or a reference mass (36) 

supported by a bending beam (37), said element further being 
at least on its surface electrically conductive to the end of 

forming a first electrode (9, 36) of the transducer, and the 
transducer further comprising at least two second, planar 

electrodes (5, 6) which are placed on the same side with 
regard to the transducing element (9, 37). According to the 

invention, the second electrodes (5, 6) have at least essentially 
equal effective areas to the end of measuring the profile of the 

transducing element (9, 37) and controlling the same to an 
exactly defined geometric state

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a capacitive transducer according to the preamble of
claim 1, said transducer employing feedback-control by means of electrostatic
force.The invention also concerns a method for controlling the profile of the transducing
element in a transducer feedback-controlled by means of electrostatic force.The following publications are cited as reference to the prior art:[p1] U.S. Pat.

Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators, pp. 832-835, 1993.Cited publications [p1 - p10] describe capacitive pressure transducer structures in
which the silicon diaphragm acting as the transducing electrode is flexible relative
to a rigid metal electrode. Cited patents [p1, p10] disclose particularly a transducer
structure suited for measuring the pressure difference imposed on the transducer
diaphragm by the pressures acting on the different sides of the diaphragm. Such a
transducer structure is termed a differential pressure transducer.Prior-art differential pressure transducer constructs can be divided into asymmetrical
and symmetrical structures. In an asymmetrical structure [cf. p1, p8], the
capacitance change is measured only between the pressure-sensitive diaphragm and
a single metal electrode. In a symmetrical structure [cf. p1, p4, p10], the
capacitance measurement is performed between the pressure-sensitive diaphragm
and metal electrodes placed on both sides of the diaphragm, which arrangement
renders differential capacitance measurement possible.In structures based on the flexure of the pressure-sensitive diaphragm under
pressure, temperature dependence is approximately a linear function of the deflection
of the
