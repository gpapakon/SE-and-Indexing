<ABSTRACT>
Organosiloxane compositions comprising specified 
combinations of MQ resins and liquid polyorganosiloxanes are 

applied as molten materials to form coatings that are non-flowable 
under ambient conditions and that can initially be 

remelted by heating the coating above its flow transition 
temperature. In the presence of moisture, the flow 

transition temperature of the coating gradually increases 
due to the reaction of hydrolyzable groups on the 

polyorganosiloxane ingredient until the coating is converted 
to a non-flowable, resin reinforced elastomer. Preferred 

coatings are non-transferable at 25°C. within ten minutes 
following application.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for applying
protective silicone coatings to substrates. This invention
involves heating a specified class of moisture reactive
organosiloxane compositions to a flowable state and applying
the compositions as coatings to a substrate, whereupon the
compositions cool and become non-flowable. The initially
applied coatings are made flowable by heating but in the
presence of atmospheric moisture the coatings gradually
convert to a resin-reinforced elastomeric material that is
not reflowable with subsequent heating to temperatures well
above the application temperature. Many of these coatings
can be handled within minutes after being coated without
damage to the coating or transfer of the coating material.The cured coatings provide long term protection
for substrates against harsh environments at temperatures
above the application temperature of the initial coating.Many combinations of resinous and liquid polymers
are well known. Some exhibit the properties characteristic
of pressure sensitive adhesives, also referred to as PSA's.
PSA's based on organosilicon compounds typically contain 1)
a silicone resin with specified concentrations of monofunctional
R3SiO units, referred to as M units, and tetrafunctional
SiO4/2 units, referred to as Q units, and 2) a high
molecular weight polydiorganosiloxane having the consistency
of a gum. These compositions are typically applied as a
solution in a compatible organic liquid or a low viscosity,
liquid non-reactive polyorganosiloxane. Following application
of the solution to a desired substrate the liquid is
evaporated to deposit the PSA. The prior art is represented by the following:
EP-A2 0,529,841; US-A 4,143,088; US-A 4,515,932;
US-A 4,753,977; US-A 4,990,364; US-A 5,070,121;
US-A 5,091,484; JP-A 64/251,827 and JP-A 04/81,487.When curable compositions are applied in the molten
state (as "hot melts") and are used as protective coatings,
the cooled uncured compositions should preferably
exhibit sufficient adhesion and low tackiness to allow the
coated articles to be handled either immediately, or shortly
following application, without damage to the coating or
transfer of the coating material to objects in contact with
the articles.When the substrate is a printed circuit board, it
is desirable that the interior portion of the coating remain
reflowable upon heating for a limited time to correct coating
defects and to make repairs of electronic components
mounted on the coated substrate. Ultimately, a crosslinked,
non-reflowable
