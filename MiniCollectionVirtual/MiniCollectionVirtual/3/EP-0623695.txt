<ABSTRACT>
So that the change of a harness can be carried out effectively and, after the harness change, the loom can be started up without loss of productivity, measures at the interface between a transport carriage (1) receiving a harness-transport device and the transport device itself and other measures have been taken. The measures are that the interface between the supporting device (2) and the transport carriage (1) is formed by centring means (9,10) which have a simple geometrical shape and, furthermore, that the supporting device consists of a first and a second pair of horizontal carriers (4,6). The pairs of horizontal carriers are received in a guide piece or crosspiece (7) so as to be longitudinally displaceable relative to one another in a common transverse plane. Each pair of carriers (4,6) is designed in such a way that more operating components can be received than is known from the state of the art.

in that the anti-tilt device comprises two pins (26, 27) 

engaging through the side walls of the guide and spaced 
apart from one another, wherein the pin (27) lying in the 

region of the guide opening guides the arm (23) in a slot 
(28).  

 
Support device according to claim 3, characterised 
in that holding members (29) for receiving a rod-shaped 

element (30) supporting the warp-monitor unit (25) are
