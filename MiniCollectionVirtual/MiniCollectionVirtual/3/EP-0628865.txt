<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic negative film 
has a red sensitive layer containing a coupler which 

reacts with oxidized color developer to form a cyan 
dye, a blue sensitive layer containing a coupler which 

reacts with oxidized color developer to form a yellow 
dye, and a green sensitive layer containing a coupler 

which reacts with oxidized color developer to form a 
magenta dye. The coupler in the green sensitive layer 

produces a magenta dye which has relatively low density 
in the 560-590 nm range as compared with magenta dyes 

produced by pyrazolotriazole type couplers or 1-phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolone 
couplers. The element 

additionally has an inert dye present, preferably 
positioned below the green sensitive layer containing 

the foregoing coupler. The inert dye has a peak 
absorption between 560-590 nm so that the negative has 

a ratio of density at 580 nm to density at 550 nm, both 
as measured at neutral midscale exposure, which is 

greater than exhibited by the element absent the inert 
dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color photographic
negative film elements containing particular types of
image-dye forming couplers and an inert dye to enhance
printer compatibility of the negative.The color negative-positive photographic
system relies on the exposure of a scene onto a color
negative film. The exposed negative is then projected
onto a negative-working color photographic paper to
form, after development, the desired positive image. In
order to correctly expose the photographic paper, the
average density of the negative in all three color
records (red, green and blue) must be measured so that
the exposure time and balance between the relative
amounts of the different colored light used to expose
the paper can be adjusted.The general practice in the photofinishing
industry is to read the average color density of the
negative using red, green and blue filters. There is
no uniform standard for these filters. Different sets
of filters may read the same negative differently
because of variations in the amount of light they pass.
In most cases, this is not a problem since the response
of a printer filter set is accounted for in the
calculation for the subsequent exposure of the paper.
However, this method assumes that the measured red,
green and blue densities of any and all negatives to be
printed by a particular printer system reflects the
color balance of the original scene. Pyrazolotriazoles have been used as magenta
couplers in commercially available color negative films
and can offer useful photographic advantages depending
on format. The hues of the magenta dyes formed from
pyrazolotriazoles are broad in terms of bandwidth, with
substantial density at wavelengths from 560 to 590 nm.
1-Phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolones are also used as
magenta couplers in commercially available color
negative films and can offer useful photographic
advantages depending on format. The hues of the magenta
dyes formed from 1-phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolones are
broad in terms of bandwidth, with substantial density
at wavelengths from 560 to 590 nm, similar to
pyrazolotriazole based dyes.1-Phenyl-3-anilino-5-pyrazolones are also
used as magenta couplers in commercially available
color negative films and can offer useful photographic
advantages depending on format. However, the hues of
the magenta dyes formed from 1-phenyl-3-anilino-5-pyrazolones
are narrower in bandwidth than those formed
from pyrazolotriazoles or 1-phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolones,
with much less density at wavelengths from
560 to 590 nm. Although
