<ABSTRACT>
A torque motor (8) comprises an armature (30) placed radially between a central bar (31) and an external ferromagnetic tubular portion (32). The central bar (31) comprises two portions of the same cylinder (33A, 33B) diametrically opposite each other and having substantially equal angular amplitudes below 180 , and separated by generally parallel longitudinal flats (34A, 34B). A radial permanent bar magnet (35) is incorporated in the central bar (31) between the cylinder portions (33A, 33B). The armature (30) has a winding (36) formed from longitudinal strands (36A) connected by transverse strands (36B) and arranged into bundles (F1, F2) within which all currents flow in the same direction at all times.
