<ABSTRACT>
A rotisserie oven (50) includes an air plenum (300) having three sections 
(320, 350, 380) surrounding a cooking chamber (100). Two sections extend along 

opposing lateral walls (110, 112) while a third section extends along the top wall 
(114) of the cooking chamber. Exhaust vents (132a, 132b) in the air plenum (300) 

provide forced, heated air into the cooking chamber (100) from at least two sides. 
A control system (210), disposed adjacent a cooling fan (252) for a blower motor 

(250), is isolated from the relatively hot cooking chamber by a stream (256) of 
cool ambient air. A conduit (514) for relatively dry ambient air is selectively 

opened to the interior of the cooking chamber (100) based on the detected relative 
humidity. Also, the drip tray (160) on which the grease falls is cooled by a stream 

of bleed air (117b) to reduce burning of grease.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to improvements in a food cooking apparatus in
general and more specifically to improvements in a rotisserie-type cooking apparatus
having at least one rotatable element for supporting a food product.Use of a rotatable element to support a food product for cooking is well known.
Such rotatable elements are often referred to as rotisseries, spits, skewers and a host of
other names. For simplicity the term rotisserie will be used with the understanding that
this term is intended to cover all forms of rotatable elements which support food
products or to which food products may be attached for cooking in all types of cooking
environments including gas or electric ovens, barbecues, microwave ovens and a variety
of other cooking environments.With reference to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a prior art rotisserie oven
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,561,348 to Halters et al. The oven includes a casing 1 housing
a grilling space 2. The grilling space is defined by a plurality of stainless steel walls 5
within outer casing 1. An air flow path is formed between the stainless steel walls 5 and
casing 1. Within the air flow path is a motor 10 for a fan and a motor 4 for rotating a
spit 3 on which the food is positioned in the grilling space 2. Fan blades 16, which are 
drivingly connected to motor 10, draw ambient air into the air flow path through
apertures 17 and expel air out of the air flow path through apertures 18. The ambient
air flowing through the air flow path cools the outer surface of the walls 5.A fat collecting tray 7 is arranged below spit 3. An upper plate 8 is provided at
the top of the cooking chamber. An inner space 2' is formed between the upper plate
8 and the top wall 5' of the cooking chamber. A fan 11 is provided within the inner
space 2', and a suction opening 9 in the upper plate 8 permits air from the grilling space
2 to be drawn in the inner space 2'. Several heating elements are provided in the
grilling space at 13, 19, 20. A grease collection device includes guide baffles 21 which
divert the dripping fat to fat collecting tray 7 through drain hole 22. During cooking,
air is drawn into inner space 2' through suction opening 9, expelled downwardly out of
inner space 2' through exhaust aperture 12, and diverted by guide baffles 21 upwardly
towards suction opening 9. Thus, a circular flow path as shown by the arrows 14 is
established within the cooking chamber 2.In general, the hottest portions of the oven are the portions proximate to the
heating elements. In ovens

A rotisserie oven comprising:

a cooking chamber (100) defined by a plurality of walls (110, 112, 114,
116, 118);
a door (58) for accessing the interior of the cooking chamber (100);
a rotary support (410) extending within the cooking chamber (100) for
supporting food products;
an air delivery system (300) comprising a first air plenum section (350)
disposed outside of at least a portion of a first wall (114) of the cooking chamber (100),

the air plenum section (350) comprising an inlet opening (149), the inlet opening
providing communication between the cooking chamber (100) and the first air plenum

section (350); and
a first blower (251) disposed in the first air plenum section (350) for
drawing air through the inlet opening (149); the rotisserie oven characterised by:
further air supplying means (510) for supplying dry ambient air to the interior of the cooking
chamber (100) while the door (58) remains closed.
An oven of claim 1, wherein the ambient air supplying means (510)
comprises a fluid communication passage (514) having at least two openings, one of

said at least two openings being disposed adjacent the inlet opening and another of said
at least two openings communicating with air outside the cooking chamber (100).
An oven of claim 2, further comprising a humidity sensor (518) for
sensing relative humidity of the cooking chamber (100) and a solenoid valve (516)

disposed in the fluid communication passage (514), the solenoid valve (516) being
opened when the relative humidity within the cooking chamber (100) as detected by the

humidity sensor (518) exceeds a first predetermined value.
An oven of claim 3, wherein the solenoid valve (516) is closed when the
