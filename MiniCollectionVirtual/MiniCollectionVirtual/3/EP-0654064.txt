<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: THERMOPLASTIC OLEFINSThis invention relates to thermoplastic olefins which display quasi-single phase behavior. In particular, this invention relates to thermoplastic olefins comprising a blend of propylene based random copolymer, ethylene propylene rubber and polyethylene. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPolypropylene exhibits several advantageous properties, for example, relatively low density excellent resistance to higher temperatures and aqueous and non-aqueous liquids. Polypropylene also has the less favorable characteristic of inadequate impact strength at temperatures below room temperature especially below OβC. Adequate impact strength, however, is required and is of importance in many uses such as for example freight containers, suitcases, automobile parts and similar parts. Articles made of high density polyethylene possess this satisfactorily high impact strength but show a lower resistance to deformation at high temperatures. Ethylene propylene elastomers, saturated as well as unsaturated, exhibit good mechanical properties such as high heat ageing resistance, high ozone resistance and impact resistance at low temperatures, such that the copolymers are also excellently suited for use where the product is exposed to weathering. Due to the elastomeric properties of these copolymers, it is popular to combine elastomers with harder polymers. Many attempts have been made to combine the properties of polypropylene and/or polyethylene and/or ethylene propylene rubbers by the production of binary or ternary blends or molding compositions. Mixtures of polypropylene and 

polyethylene are known, however, these mixtures exhibit an impact strength at room temperature which is hardly improved over polypropylene itself. Also, blends of isotactic polypropylene and ethylene propylene elastomers, which are cross-linked or partially cross- linked by vulcanizing agents, require improvement with respect to tensile strength, modulus, and hardness values attainable.Blends of polyethylene with EPDM terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and nonconjugated diene are known from US Patent No. 3,919,358 and exhibit high tear strengths. The blends do not show sufficient heat resistance due to the low melting temperature polyethylene. Ternary molding compositions are also described in British patent No. 1,154,447. These crystalline polypropylene, polyethylene and ethylene propylene block copolymer ternary blends exhibit a tensile strength of only 10 N/mm2 and are not flexible at temperatures below 30°C.
