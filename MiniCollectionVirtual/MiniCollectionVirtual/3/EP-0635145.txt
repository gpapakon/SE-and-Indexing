<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing photoresists having a very low level of metal
ions, especially sodium and iron, and for using such
photoresists in producing semiconductor devices. The
present invention also relates to a process for making
photoresists having a very low level of metal ions, such
as sodium and iron. Further, the present invention
relates to a process for coating substrates with these
photoresist compositions as well as the process of
coating, imaging and developing photoresists on suitable
substrates.Photoresist compositions are used in
microlithography processes for making miniaturized
electronic components such as in the fabrication of
computer chips and integrated circuits. Generally, in
these processes, a thin coating of film of a photoresist
composition is first applied to a substrate material,
such as silicon wafers used for making integrated
circuits. The coated substrate is then baked to
evaporate any solvent in the photoresist composition and
to fix the coating onto the substrate. The baked coated
surface of the substrate is next subjected to an imagewise
exposure to radiation.This radiation exposure causes a chemical
transformation in the exposed areas of the coated
surface. Visible light, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron
beam and X-ray radiant energy are radiation types
commonly used today in microlithographic processes.
After this image-wise exposure, the coated substrate is
treated with a developer solution to dissolve and remove
either the radiation-exposed or the unexposed areas of
the coated surface of the substrate. Metal contamination has been a problem for a long
time in the fabrication of high density integrated
circuits and computer chips, often leading to increased
defects, yield losses, degradation and decreased
performance. In plasma processes, metals such as sodium
and iron, when they are present in photoresists, can
cause contamination especially during plasma stripping.
However, these problems have been overcome to a
substantial extent during the fabrication process. For
example, by utilizing HCL gettering of the contaminants
during a high temperature anneal cycle.As semiconductor devices have become more
sophisticated, these problems have become much more
difficult to overcome. When silicon wafers are coated
with a liquid positive photoresist and subsequently
stripped off, such as with oxygen microwave plasma, the
performance and stability of the semiconductor device is
often seen to decrease. As the plasma stripping process
is
