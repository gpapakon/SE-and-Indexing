<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new liponucleotide analog
compounds having useful antiviral activity, represented by
general formula (I) :

   wherein R1 is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 6-22
C atoms ; R2 is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 12 - 20
C atoms ; R3 and R4 are each hydrogen or hydroxy ; and B is one
of the nucleoside bases of formula (a):

   wherein R5 is a hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, amino, mercapto,
or C1 - C4 alkyl amino ; R6 is a hydrogen, halogen or amino ; W 
is a nitrogen or C - R8, where R8 is hydrogen, halogen, amino or
C1 - C4 alkyl, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.The present invention also relates to methods of preparing
and using the compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions
containing effective amounts of such compounds.The compounds of formula (I), consisting of 1-S-alkyl
phospholipid and nucleoside, may be D-form or L-form in its
phospholipid portion or the mixture thereof.Liponucleotides, consisting of nucleoside and phospholipid
have been synthesized to allow the nucleosides to be delivered
efficiently to cancer or virus infected cells and thereby
increase their antiviral effect. Diacyl-glycero-nucleoside
compounds, for instance, have been produced by reacting
nucleoside-5'-monophosphomorpholidate with 1,2-diacyl glycero-3-phosphate
[Journal of Medical Chemistry 25, 1322 (1982);
Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication 85, 715
(1978); Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 619, 604 (1980)].In addition, a compound consisting of 1-0-alkyl-2-0-acyl-glycero-3-phosphate
and nucleoside, wherein the
phospholipid having anticancer and immune modulating activity was
expected to give synergistic or at least additive effect together
with the nucleoside, has been disclosed in Korean Patent
Publication No. 93/1988. WO 91/19726 discloses other lipid nucleoside covalent
conjugates and derivatives. The document describes
pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using them to
combat HIV-1 infections. In particular the document
discloses 3'Azido-3' deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate-D,L-3
octadecanamido-2-ethoxypropane and 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine-5'
butyrate-γ-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium-β-(1-phospho-2-ethoxy-3-hexadecyloxypropane)
as examples.DE 4026265 discloses nucleoside phospholipid
derivatives, their tautomers and salts. Their use as
antiviral agents active against DNA viruses, RNA viruses
and especially retroviruses is suggested.WO 86/00309 discloses cytotoxic compounds,
particularly conjugates of antitumor compounds and
thiophospholipid exhibiting
