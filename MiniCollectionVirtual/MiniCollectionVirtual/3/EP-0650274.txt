<ABSTRACT>
A method for use in multicellular communication network 
system of the type having base stations and a plurality of 

remote stations. The method achieves reliable and fault 
tolerant synchronization between the stations in a call 

when a frequency hopping technique is used. The method 
includes steps for acquiring the frequency hop sequence by 

remote station and tracking the frequency hop sequence 
after acquisition in order to stay in synchronism. The 

method also provides for recovering from loss of 
synchronism and for staying in synchronism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communication systems, and
more particularly to synchronization of frequency hopping
communication systems which are fault-tolerant in the
presence of transmission errors.Frequency hopping is a radio communication technique in
spread-spectrum modulation wherein information is
transmitted using a sequence of carrier frequencies that
change at set times to produce a narrow band signal that
bounces or hops around in center frequency over the
available spectrum.In a centrally controlled multicellular mobile radio
communication system based on slow frequency hopping, each
cell has a base station that provides the necessary timing
and control information received and used by all the remote
stations that belong to the cell.All stations belonging to a cell, the base station and all
remote stations that belong to it, must hop in synchronism
in order to communicate with each other at the same
frequency. Different cells will typically operate on
different frequency hopping patterns, The control
information required for synchronized frequency hopping is
broadcast by the base station. A key problem in the
operation of a frequency-hopping based system is that of
maintaining hop synchronization between all stations that
belong to the same cell. Synchronization must be ensured 
even under conditions of loss of transmission of control
information. The problem of maintaining synchronism can be
further divided into the subproblems of: a) Obtaining
initial synchronism, b) Staying in synchronism and c)
Reacquisition of synchronism after temporary loss of
synchronism. The base station may modify at any time the
frequency hopping pattern (for instance to overcome
interferences) and the remote stations must be able to
follow this pattern change in an efficient and reliable
manner.The following references are typical of the background art
in the field of frequency hopping systems and
synchronization techniques therefore.In U.S. Patent 5,130,987 issued July 14, 1992 to Flammer
entitled "Method For Synchronizing A Wide Area Network
Without Global Synchronizing", a frequency-hopping packet
communication system without a master clock or master
control unit is described which is based on use of a
receiver's frequency hopping timing and identification to
control communication. A frequency-hopping band plan,
involving the number of channels and the pseudo-random
pattern of frequency change and nominal timing of changes,
is universally known to each node in the network. A
