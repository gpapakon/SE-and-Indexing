<DESCRIPTION>
OIL SOLUBLE METAL-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS.This invention relates to radiation curable coatings, adhesives, inks and molded articles. The invention also relates to clear, transparent molded articles useful as lenses, laminating resins, and novel unsaturated metal sulfates.The use of metal (meth)acrylates such as zinc, calcium and magnesium salts of acrylic or methacrylic acids as crosslinking monomers for use with elastomers to promote adhesion to substrates is well known. As described in Proudfit, US Patent 5,314, 187 for example, zinc acrylate, zinc diacrylate, and zinc methacrylate are particularly suitable crosslinking agents for elastomers such as EPDM, 1 ,4-butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, and the like. Ahmad et al., US Patent 5,506,308 teaches use of unsaturated carboxylic metal salts such as zinc diacrylate in curable elastomeric compositions wherein the elastomer may be a nitrile rubber, EPDM, EVA, and the like. Other prior patents which teach zinc acrylate, zinc diacrylate, zinc methacrylate, calcium diacrylate, and calcium dimethacrylate as crosslinking agents for elastomers include US Patents 5,731,371 5,721,304 ; 5,656,703 ; 5,208,294 ; 5, 126,501 ; 4,918, 144 4,770,422 ; 4,720,526 ; 4,715,607 ; 4,716,409 ; 4,529,770 4,500,466 ; 4,495,326 ; 4, 165,877 ; 4,065,537 ; and 4,264,075.One disadvantage of such metal salts of carboxylic acids is their poor oil solubility. For example, they are relatively insoluble in organic monomers and oligomers.Soluble zinc and calcium salts of ethylene glycol-methacrylate- phthalate (EMD) prepared in aqueous solution, and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylates (MMA), styrene (ST), and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were disclosed by Matsuda, et al., Preparation and Copolymerization of Divalent Metal Salts of Ethylene Glycol-Methacrylate-Phthalate, J. App. Poly. Sci., 17, 1941- 1952 (1973), as ionic crosslinkers. The resultant crosslinked copolymers are shown to have improved physical properties. 

 US Patent 3,847,846 assigned to Kansai Paint Co., Ltd., teaches electrically conductive resins prepared from metal salts of certain sulphonates, phosphates or phosphoric acid diesters, with an epoxide, optional solvent, polymerization initiator, and/ or photosensitizer, and useful for magnetic tape and the like.Matsuda, et al., US Patent 3,899,382, teaches polyvalent metal salts of compounds such as diethylene glycol methacrylate phthalate, mixed with an organic peroxide.Matsuda, et al., Metal-Containing Cured Resins Based on Divalent
