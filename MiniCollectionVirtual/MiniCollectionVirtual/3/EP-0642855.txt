<ABSTRACT>
A casting mold includes a cavity formed therein, and 

a core projecting into the cavity. The core 
forms a concave portion in a cast product, and it exhibits a 

thermal expansion coefficient being equivalent to or more than 
a thermal expansion coefficient exhibited by a molten metal to 

be charged into the cavity. Hence, the core greatly 
expands thermally during casting, and it keeps the expanded 

state during the solidification of the molten metal. 
Accordingly, the casting mold can prevent the casting defects 

resulting from the shrinkage cavities from arising in the 
resulting cast products. All in all, the casting mold can 

obviate to give the core a tapered configuration, and 
it can reduce the after-casting machining allowance to be 

provided in the resulting concave portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
used to produce a cast product having a concave portion, e.g.,
a hole or the like, therein.For instance, as set forth in Japanese Unexamined Utility
Model Publication (KOKAI) No. 59-25,361, a core or a core pin
has been used conventionally when producing a cast product
which has a concave portion such as a hole or the like therein.
The core or the core pin is subjected to a holding force which
results from the shrinkage of a molten metal during
solidification. Accordingly, it is difficult to remove the
core or the core pin from the resulting cast product after
cooling the cast product. Hence, in order to make the core or
the core pin likely to be removed from the cast product, it is
usually tapered gradually from wide to narrow in the direction
toward its leading end.When the cast products are produced by using the core or 
the core pin, they come to have a concave portion such as a
hole or the like. However, the resulting concave portion is
inevitably formed in a tapered hole whose inside diameter
reduces from large to small in the direction toward its inner
side. Thus, it is hard to make the resulting concave portion
which has an identical inside diameter over its entire length.
As a result, it is a routine practice to carry out machining on
the inner periphery of the concave portion after the casting,
thereby establishing an identical inside diameter over the
entire length of the concave portion.In particular, when die-casting aluminum or zinc, the
molten aluminum or zinc is solidified rapidly at its surface
where it is brought into contact with a mold. Consequently, at
the surface where the molten aluminum or zinc is brought into
contact with the mold, there is formed a healthy layer in which
no bubbles are involved in a thickness of from about 0.7 to 1.0
mm. However, there exist blow holes in the deeper layer
disposed under the healthy layer, because the molten aluminum
or zinc is solidified at a slower rate in the deeper layer.Thus, when the taper-holed concave portion formed by
casting is machined, and especially when the concave portion
has a long overall length, the machining allowance should be
enlarged on the inner side of the concave portion so that it
goes beyond the healthy layer. As a result, the blow holes 
come to be exposed to produce defects. For example, when a
cast product is produced by using a core or a core pin having a
draft angle of 1 degree and when the resulting concave portion
has an overall length of 200 mm, the concave portion

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a cast product with a concave
portion, comprising the steps of:


inserting a core (3; 6) projecting into a cavity (10)
of a casting mold,
charging a molten metal into the cavity (10), and
solidifying the molten metal,
the core (3; 6) exhibiting a thermal expansion
coefficient being equivalent to or more than a thermal

expansion coefficient exhibited by the molten metal,

wherein

a) the core temperature is sharply raised during
casting and the core is thus expanded to apply a

pressing force on the molten metal, and
b) immediately after or before the solidification of
the molten metal has been completed, the core (3;

6) is cooled by supplying water to a cooling water
circuit provided in the casting mold in order to

cool the core (3; 6) rapidly and forcibly before
splitting the mold, while
c) increasing the temperature difference between the
core (3) and the cast product.

molten metal
