<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for hay soaking wherein a body of 
hay is held immersed during soaking by a hay-retaining 

grid (16). After soaking the treatment fluid is allowed to 
drain through a common drain and filling valve (14). The tank (12) 

is then tipped to complete the hay-draining process. 
While tipped, the hay-retaining grid (16) retains the hay and 

is then removed whereby the heavy body of soaked hay can 
be deposited on draining slats (18) or the like without any 

significant lifting thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for hay
soaking.The invention may also find application to other related
techniques in which a mass or body of crop or the like
material is treated with liquid, and thereby is rendered
relatively heavy and requires subsequent handling.Hay soaking is not a new technique. Whilst it is known to
soak hay in tanks, most systems use lifting gear to place
the hay into and out of a tank (GB 2 238 036 and DE 3 909
850 and DE 3 505 067). There is disclosed in GB 2 250 673
a stationary tank having a hinged screen which is revolved
to place hay on it into the tank and to pick up and drain
hay resting in the tank, according to the preambles of claims 1 and 5.In the case of hay soaking, a body of hay, such as hay in
a hay net, or a bale of hay is treated with water in order
to produce several effects including reduction of the
amount of dust in the hay, which can cause horses
consuming the hay to cough. Likewise, the treatment also
is carried out in order to, effectively, wash the hay so
as to reduce the presence of bacteria and spores. The
washing is usually carried out with plain water, but of
course additional materials may be included in the water
if so desired in order to increase the effect of the 
treatment on bacteria or spores or otherwise.A problem that arises in relation to hay soaking is that,
after soaking, the body of hay is much heavier than
before. This leads to lifting problems. Back injuries
can be caused to personnel. At the very least, the
increase in weight causes delays in the handling of the
soaked hay.Prior proposals in this regard, as indicated above,
include the provision of traditional lifting gear for the
soaked hay, for example in the form such as might be used
for lifting or hoisting the engine from a car during
repair operations. Another prior proposal which may have
been made includes the provision in a hay soaking tank of
means for lifting the soaked hay out of the tank so that
it can then be handled.An object of the present invention is to provide a method
and apparatus offering improvements in relation to the
handling of soaked hay and/or in the soaking process
itself and/or in the separation of the soaked hay from the
soaking fluid and/or in relation to one or more other
matters discussed herein, or generally.In accordance with the invention there is provided
apparatus adapted for use in soaking hay and a method of
soaking hay as defined in the accompanying claims.According to the invention there is provided
apparatus and a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus adapted for use in soaking hay and the like
comprising:-


a) a tank (12) to receive a body of hay;
b) said tank (12) being adapted to receive water or
other treatment fluid to effect soaking;
c) a hay retaining member (16) mounted in relation to

said tank (12) and positionable in relation to the tank
(12) and fluid when contained therein so as to be capable

of holding a body of hay more fully immersed in said fluid
than it would be otherwise; characterised by:
d) hay removal means comprising pivot means (18) to
permit tipping of said tank (12).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised by means
(14) adapted to discharge at least some of said treatment

fluid before said tank (12) is tipped.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised by said hay retaining member (16)

comprising a grid or mesh or the like member.
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised by said
hay-retaining member being mounted in relation to said tank

(12) so as to be removable therefrom or movable to a non
hay-retaining position.
A method of soaking hay or the like; said method
comprising retaining a body of hay in soaking relationship

with a body of water in a tank (12) by locating the body of
hay below a hay retaining member (16), or in a defined

working relationship thereto, whereby the body of hay is
more fully immersed during soaking; characterised by the

step of tipping said tank (12) after treatment of hay 
therein to enable the body of treated hay to be removed

without significant lifting thereof.
A method according to claim 5, characterised by the
step of discharging treatment fluid from said tank before

tipping thereof.
