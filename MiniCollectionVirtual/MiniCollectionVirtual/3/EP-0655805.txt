<ABSTRACT>
Cable plugs for medium-voltage networks are known in which a plug contact pin (30) is screwed into a base piece (20) to which a sleeve is fitted by friction welding. A cable conductor (3) is pressed into the sleeve. The known cable plug is of elongated construction, is relatively cumbersome to install (assemble) and has a large number of individual parts as well as contact resistances between them. It is proposed to construct a retaining hole (21) for accommodating the cable conductor (3) in the base piece (20) and to screw the plug contact pin (30) into the base piece in such a manner that a spherical end surface (32) on it firmly clamps the cable conductor (3) in the retaining hole (21).
