<DESCRIPTION>
The compounds of the present invention have an 
antiproliferative affect on cell division and are thus 
indicated for use in the treatment of diseases where excess 
cell proliferation or protease release is an important 
aspect of the pathology. Therefore, the compounds are 
useful in treating diabetic complications and restenosis. Diabetic complications, including diabetic 
retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are largely the 
result of abnormalities in microvascular function. Changes 
in vascular function include increased blood vessel 
permeability and altered blood flow. These changes precede 
the development of the clinical symptoms of diabetic 
complications. The later stages of diabetic retinopathy and 
proliferative vitreoretinopathy are characterized by the 
growth of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis. One of the 
early events in angiogenesis is secretion of proteases 
involved in the dissolution of the basement membrane. 
These proteases include the plasminogen activators, 
procollagenase and prostromelysin. Plasminogen activators 
such as urokinase (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator 
(tPA) are serine proteases which cleave the zymogen 
plasminogen to generate the active serine protease plasmin. 
Plasmin can influence basement membrane integrity directly 
through cleavage of basement membrane components or 
indirectly through cleavage of procollagenase and 
prostromelysin to generate active collagenase and 
stromelysin. The resulting dissolution of the basement 
membrane allows the endothelial cells to escape from the 
microvessel and begin the neovascularization process. Increased plasmin formation also has several 
ramifications in terms of the permeability of the diabetic 
microvessel. Plasmin can directly degrade basement 
membrane components or can activate stromelysin, thus  
 
directly or indirectly influencing the normal turnover of 
heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Because HSPG is 
involved in blood vessel permeability as well as growth 
control, this enhanced degradation of HSPG may result in 
its depletion from the membrane with resultant increased 
vessel permeability. Microvascular dysfunctions arise through this 
abnormal activation of endothelial cells which is mediated, 
in part, through protein kinase C (PKC)-regulated pathways.
