<ABSTRACT>
A demodulator (10) demodulates a PSK communications signal using a
synchronizer (12), a period window detector (20), and a logic device (22). The

synchronizer provides a transition signal representing reference edges of the
communication signal. The period window detector, coupled to the synchronizer,

establishes a time interval based on the period of the transition signal. Finally, the logic
device, having logic inputs coupled to the outputs of the period-window detector, yields

a logic output signal. The demodulator preferably includes a carrier boundary detector
(34) for framing messages and minimizing noise detection in a manner that permits

signal strength measurements over a wide d ynamic range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to demodulators for communications equipment and, in particular, to demodulators for phase-shift-keyed or analogous communications signals.Phase-shift-keying (PSK) demodulators often have used inflexible fixed-function circuitry limited to particular applications. Consequently, new or different applications have required designing new circuitry for particular applications, which tended to increase costs of the demodulators.Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC's) and phase locked loops (PLL's) are illustrative examples of fixed-function circuitry used in PSK demodulators. An ASIC may comprise a dedicated algorithm to recover the message content of a received signal. Similarly, a PLL comprises an oscillator control mechanism that limits the practical frequency range of demodulators. While the frequency range of a PLL circuit may be enhanced by using adjustable components or replacing components, such hardware changes may require disassembly of the PLL circuit, its housing, or other disruptive measures. Thus, a need exists for a cost-effective demodulator that is readily apposite to a wide assortment of applications.One fixed-function modulator design is disclosed in United States Patent 5,533,069, to Fleek et al. Fleek discloses a PSK demodulator which operates at a given frequency by counting a predetermined number of pulses for a measured clock count value. The demodulator disclosed therein, determines when the spacing between peaks of a square wave change due to phase-shift-keying. This square wave is output by a digital filter which helps distinguish transitory events in a waveform from being confused with disturbances.One problem with certain existing demodulators is insufficient immunity to spurious noise. Noise may be caused by a prodigious variety of man-made sources that intentionally or unintentionally radiate electromagnetic energy within a frequency range affecting a PSK carrier frequency of interest. Typical sources of noise include telecom-munications equipment, electric motors, generators, and internal combustion engines, among others. As referred to herein, inter-message noise refers to electromagnetic noise energy between PSK messages. Inter-message noise may be modeled as a randomly occurring electromagnetic signal with an amplitude characterized by a probability density function. Inter-message noise tends to degrade reception of PSK messages and interpretation of demodulated data. A demodulator with insufficient immunity to noise is
