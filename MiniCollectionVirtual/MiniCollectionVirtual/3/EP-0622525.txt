<ABSTRACT>
Such a gap (4) is arranged between a rotating first component in the nature of a shaft (1) and a second component in the nature of a bushing (3) and at its ends is exposed to a pressure gradient in a surrounding fluid. The gap (4) consequently has a high pressure side (5) and a low pressure side (6). The second component is provided with openings (8), independent of one another and distributed over the circumference, by way of which openings a flow of highly pressurised fluid flows into the gap (4) in order to improve the quiet running of the rotating component. In order to reduce the vibrations and stabilise the shaft (1), the openings (8) are arranged so that the flow fed by way of the openings (8) is added as stabilising flow (9) to a gap flow (7) flowing from the high pressure side (5) to the low pressure side (6) and the pressure in the stabilising flow (9) is selected so that both flows emerge from the gap (4) solely on the low pressure side (6). Owing to the support action a gap (4) designed in this way increases the quiet running of the rotating component and is suitable for use under increased stressing. The invention may be used in particular in axial thrust-relieving devices.

A component arrangement defining a radial gap (4), for 
instance of a fluid flow machine, arranged between a rotating 

first component resembling a shaft (1) and a second element 
resembling a bushing (3), which gap is subject to a pressure 

gradient at its ends in a surrounding fluid and consequently 
possesses a high pressure side (5) and a low pressure side (6), 

the second component possessing openings (8), which are independent 
of one another and are distributed about the periphery, 

through which openings, for the purpose of improving the smooth 
running properties of the rotating component, a flow under a 

high pressure emerges into the gap (4), characterized in that 
the openings (8) are so placed that the flow supplied through 

the openings (8) is added as a stabilizing flow (9) to a gap 
flow (7) flowing from the high pressure side (5) to the low 

pressure side (6) and the pressure in the stabilizing flow (9) 
is so selected that both flows emerge exclusively at the low 

pressure side (6) from the gap (4). 
The component arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the openings (8) in the bushing (3) are so 

arranged that they open into a central region of the gap (4). 
The component arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or in 
claim 2, characterized in that the openings (8) in the bushing 

(3) are radial holes evenly distributed about the periphery. 
The component arrangement as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 through 3, characterized in that the openings (8) lie 

in a plane perpendicular to the central axis of the shaft (1). 
The component arrangement as claimed in any one of the  
 

claims 1 through 4, characterized in that the openings (8) are 
arranged in a plurality of planes perpendicular to the central 

axis of the shaft (1) with a mutual axial spacing from each 
other. 
An axial thrust balancinq device of a fluid flow motor 
comprising a component arrangement as claimed in any one of the 

claims 1 through 5, in the case of which the first component 
comprises a relieving element, rotating with a shaft (1) and 

having at least one section in the form of a piston (2) and the 

second component comprises a stationary bushing (3), characterized 
in that a relief flow (7) flows through the gap (4) from 

the impeller side space of an impeller as a high pressure region 
(5) into a low pressure region as a low pressure side (6). 
The axial thrust balancing device as claimed in claim 
6, characterized in that the stabilizing flow (9) is branched 

off outside the impeller side space from a region with a pressure 
increased above the unaffected pressure in the gap (4) at 

the point (A) of emergence from the openings (8). 
The axial thrust balancinq device as claimed in either 
of the claims 6 and 7, characterized in that the flow (9) is 

branched from a pressure housing (12) or a pressure connection 
means (11) of the fluid flow machine. 
The axial thrust balancing device as claimed in any one 
of the claims 6 through 8, characterized in that a centrifugal 

pump with a head of 200 m. upward is provided with it.
