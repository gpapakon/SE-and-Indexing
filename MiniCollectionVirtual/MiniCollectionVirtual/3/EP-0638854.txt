<ABSTRACT>
This element is used for the method in which an electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image 
carrier is developed in a liquid toner, and after the image which appears by this development is electrostatically 

transferred to an intermediate transfer element, the image on the element is further transferred to a material which 
receives the image. At least a silicone rubber layer, an adhesive layer and a conductive fluororubber layer are arranged 

in this order from the outer surface. Such an intermediate transfer element has an excellent durability and an excellent 
transfer ability. Therefore, an image forming method using the intermediate transfer element provides a high-quality 

image with a good reproducibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intermediate transfer 
material used for an image forming method of developing an 
electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image carrier 
by a livid toner, electrostatically transferring the image 
visualized by the development onto an intermediate transfer 
material, and re-transferring the visible image on the intermediate 
transfer material onto final transfer objects, for example, an 
intermediate transfer material used for the image forming method 
adopted in copiers and laser beam printers. The intermediate transfer materials used for the above image 
forming method include the following. For example, EP Laid-Open No. 399186 (Conventional Example 1) 
discloses an intermediate transfer material with a two-layer 
elastic layer consisting of a thin dielectric layer smooth on the 
surface and a conductive layer supporting the dielectric layer, and 
as for the material of the dielectric layer, it is only stated to 
simply use silicone coating or fluorine coating, etc. Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 3-243973 (Conventional 
Example 2) discloses an intermediate transfer material with an  
 
elastic layer smooth on the surface and capable of absorbing the 
solvent in the livid toner. The elastic layer consists of a 
dielectric layer and a conductive layer. An example of the 
intermediate material has a conductive silicone rubber coated with 
an insulating silicone rubber. Furthermore, USP 5099286 (Conventional Example 3) discloses an 
intermediate transfer material with a dielectric layer formed on a 
conductive base. An example of the intermediate transfer material 
has a dielectric layer made of polytetrafluoroethylene layer formed 
on a conductive base made of urethane rubber. The intermediate transfer materials used for the above 
mentioned image forming method are rehired to satisfy the 
following requirements. 
(1) The visible image should be able to be efficiently transferred 
onto the intermediate transfer material. (2) The visible image on the intermediate transfer material should 
be able to be efficiently re-transferred onto final transfer 
objects. (3) The intermediate transfer material should be durable. However, the above Conventional Examples 1 to 3 do not satisfy 
all of the requirements (1) to (3). For example, if a material like silicone coating or fluorine 
coating is simply used as in Conventional Example 1, the durability 
is not sufficient. In Conventional Example 2, since a conductive  
 
silicone rubber is used for the elastic
