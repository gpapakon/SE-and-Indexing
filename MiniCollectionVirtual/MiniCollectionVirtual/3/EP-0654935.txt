<ABSTRACT>
Continuous tone black and white images are 
duplicated using l
aser thermal digital halftone 
printing. A continuous tone black and white image 

signal is provided by a source (16) such as a medical 
imaging source. The image signal is screened with a 

digital halftone screen (30), such that each pixel of 
said image signal is represented by a predetermined 

matrix of micropixels, so that to produce a digital 
halftone image signal corresponding to the continuous 

tone black and white image signal. A master is created 
by printing (12) the digital halftone image onto a dye 

ablated medium (34) by means of laser thermal 
recording. A duplicate of the master is produced (14) 

by contact printing onto a duplicating medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to the
duplication of black and white images and, more
particularly, to the duplication of radiographic,
medical or other high quality black and white images
using laser thermal digital halftone printing.In conventional film/screen radiography, a
body part of a patient is exposed to x-rays to produce
a latent x-ray image in film. The exposed film is
processed and ready for viewing by a radiologist or
other medical made diagnostician. In many cases, it is
desirable to have more than one copy of an x-ray image
available for use by other medical personnel, for
archiving, for transmission to a remote location, and
so forth.One method of making duplicate copies of
radiographs has been by contact printing on direct-positive
duplicating film. Because of the difficult
set of requirements on the duplicating film, that is,
high maximum density (D max), gamma = -1, and wide
dynamic range, it has been difficult to obtain accurate
and inexpensive copies by this method. Other contact
printing techniques, such as the thermal duplicating
technique disclosed in US-A-3,768,906; and
US-A-4,967,287, do not have high enough quality to be
useful in radiographic film duplication.In the case of other medical imaging
modalities, such as computerized tomography (CT), or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the image is
acquired, digitized, and stored on a magnetic or
optical storage medium (disk, tape). Such an image may
be printed, for example, on a laser film printer and
the film developed in a film processor. Multiple 
duplicates can be made by repeating the process. In
doing so, however, one is limited by the relatively
slow throughput time of the laser film
printer/processor.Laser thermal recording of images by means of
analog ablation and/or evaporation techniques are known
in the production of optical records and the like.
(See, for example, US-A-4,000,492; US-A-4,023,185; and
US-A-4,097,895.) The ablated record can then be used
to produce duplicates by optical contact printing (See
US-A-4,980,262), or by impression contact printing (See
US-A-4,285,056).The method of halftone printing as a means of
rendering continuous tone imagery using ablation
recording on thin metal (for example, bismuth) layers
is disclosed in US-A-3,720,784 and EP-A-0 564 877 (See also:
Micromachining and Image Recording on Thin Films by
Laser Beams, by D. Maydan, The Bell System Technical
Journal, Vol. 50, No. 6, July-August 1971.) A
projection copy of the record can be made by
photographic or electrophotographic
