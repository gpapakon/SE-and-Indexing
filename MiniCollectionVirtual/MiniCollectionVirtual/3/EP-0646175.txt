<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production and use of
recombinant Pseudomonas-derived toxins modified to increase
their toxicity and potency in therapy. More particularly, the
invention relates to exotoxins comprising deletions in the
amino acid sequence that represent the removal of domain Ia
and certain sequences of domain II of Pseudomonas exotoxin.Toxins attached to growth factors, antibodies and
other cell targeting molecules can be used to kill harmful
cells bearing specific receptors or antigens (Pastan et al.,
Cell 47:641 (1986) and Vitetta et al, Science 238:1098
(1987)). One promising source for an effective therapeutic
toxin is Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE)
is an extremely active monomeric protein (molecular weight
66kD), secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which inhibits
protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells through the inactivation
of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) by catalyzing its ADP-ribosylation
(catalyzing the transfer of the ADP ribosyl
moiety of oxidized NAD onto EF-2).The toxin contains three structural domains that act
in concert to cause cytotoxicity. Domain Ia (amino acids 1-252)
mediates cell binding. Domain II (amino acids 253-364)
is responsible for translocation into the cytosol and domain
III (amino acids 400-613) mediates ADP ribosylation of
elongation factor 2, which inactivates the protein and causes
death. The function of domain Ib (amino acids 365-399)
remains undefined, although a large part of it, amino acids
365-380, can be deleted without loss of cytotoxicity. See
Siegall et al., Biochem. 30:7154-7159 (1991). PE has been
combined with growth factors, antibodies or CD4 to create
toxins that can be selectively targeted to cells with 
different cell membrane proteins as reviewed in Pastan and
FitzGerald, Science 254:1173-1177 (1991).Native PE characteristically produces death due to
liver failure. Immunotoxins with PE also attack the liver
and, when given in much larger (20 to 250-fold larger) doses,
may produce death due to liver toxicity. Improved forms of PE
that reduce non-specific toxicity in the host and which
improve therapeutic efficacy are highly desirable. Variants
of PE omitting the cell binding domain Ia have been found to
be effective while reducing the amount of non-specific
toxicity. See, U.S. Patent No. 4,892,827, for example.This invention discloses improved recombinant
Pseudomonas exotoxin molecules that demonstrate higher
activities than prior described molecules. Further, the
discoveries described here enable one to create PE
