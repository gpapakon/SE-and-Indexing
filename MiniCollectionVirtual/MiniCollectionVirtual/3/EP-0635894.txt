<ABSTRACT>
A layered structure formed on a substrate comprising an oxide 
superconductor thin film deposited on the substrate, a noble metal 

monolayer deposited on the oxide superconductor thin film and an 
insulator thin film deposited on the noble metal monolayer. The noble 

metal monolayer prevents interdiffusion between the oxide 
superconductor thin film and the insulator thin film so that they have 

excellent properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a layered structure comprising an
insulator thin film and an oxide superconductor thin film, more
specifically, to a layered structure comprising an insulator thin film and
an oxide superconductor thin film with a little interdiffusion at an
interface between those two thin films.Oxide superconductors which have been recently advanced in study
have higher critical temperatures than those of metallic superconductors,
so that they are more applicable for practical usage. For example,
Y-Ba-Cu-O type oxide superconductor has a critical temperature higher
than 80 K and it is announced that Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type oxide
superconductor and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O type oxide superconductor have
critical temperatures higher than 100 K.In order to apply the oxide superconductors to superconducting
devices, it is necessary to make oxide superconductors in a form of thin
films. The term thin films means films, having a thickness of from 10-1
nanometers to on the order of 10 Âµm, artificially deposited on substrates. 
The oxide superconductor thin films are usually deposited on single
crystal substrates, for example a MgO substrate, a SrTiO3 substrate, a
YSZ (yttrium stabilized zirconia) substrate, etc., by various methods such
as a sputtering, an MBE (molecular beam epitaxy), a reactive
co-evaporation, a CVD (chemical vapor deposition). The oxide
superconductor thin films grow epitaxially on these substrate.It is also necessary to deposit other thin films on the oxide
superconductor thin films in order to manufacture some types of
superconducting devices. For example, a tunnel type Josephson junction
comprises a layered structure of a first superconducting layer, an thin
insulator layer and a second superconducting layer stacked in the named
order. Therefore, if an oxide superconductor is applied to the tunnel type
Josephson junction device, a first oxide superconductor thin film, an
insulator thin film and a second oxide superconductor thin film should be
stacked in the named order.A superconducting field effect device, a candidate of realistic
three-terminal superconducting devices, has a superconducting channel
and a gate electrode formed on the superconducting channel through a
gate insulator layer. If a superconducting field effect device is
manufactured by using an oxide superconductor, it is necessary to stack an
oxide superconductor thin film, an insulator thin film and a normal
conductor film in the named order.In addition, in order to fabricate a superconducting multi-layer
wiring
