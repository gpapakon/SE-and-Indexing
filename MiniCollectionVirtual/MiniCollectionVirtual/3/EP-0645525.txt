<ABSTRACT>
In a two-stroke engine having a pressurised air rail 
for producing an atomized fuel spray for injection into the 

individual combustion chambers, oil for lubrication is 
atomized by metering it into a stream of compressed air 

taken from the rail or a reservoir connected thereto and 
the resulting oil-air mist is injected into the crankcase 

and/or the lower part of the cylinder selectively and 
directly on to points requiring lubrication.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the lubrication of 
two-stroke internal combustion engines of the kind in which 
fuel is injected directly into the individual combustion 
chambers of the cylinders and the combustion air is pumped 
separately from the crankcase into the combustion chambers. Oil for lubrication of such engines is metered 
intermittently into the air supply to the crankcase through 
an oil jet upstream of a reed valve located at the air 
intake to the crankcase. The reed valve acts as a 
non-return valve for the air supply and the vibrating reeds 
serve to break up the oil into droplets and disperse it in 
the intake air. It is, however, difficult to control the 
amount of oil to meet the requirements of the engine, and 
contact of the reeds at the intake orifice with liquid oil 
can both affect the dynamic behaviour of the reeds and lead 
in time to their becoming coated with a gummy deposit that 
further interferes with their action in breaking up and 
dispersing the oil. The oil jet may also tend to become 
blocked by the formation of wax and/or ice at sub-zero 
temperatures. FR-A-2 638 204 discloses a pump-type two-stroke 
engine in which part of the air compressed in the crankcase 
in the power stroke of the piston is used to pre-atomize the 
oil and to inject the resulting fine mist of oil droplets in 
air into the crankcase. The air for the atomization is 
taken from the crankcase of the same or a different cylinder 
of the engine, but in either case the flow rate and timing 
of the oil supply are both dependent on the operation of the 
engine. The present invention provides a two-stroke engine 
having a pressurised air rail for producing an atomized fuel 
spray for injection into the individual combustion chambers, 
in which oil for lubrication is atomized by metering it into 
a stream of compressed air taken from the rail or a 
reservoir connected thereto and the resulting oil-air mist  
 
is injected into the crankcase and/or the lower part of the 
cylinder selectively and directly on to points requiring 
lubrication. In order to fulfil its function in the fuel 
injection system, the air pressure in the pressurised rail 
is necessarily in excess of the maximum pressure in the 
crankcase, so that the compressed air stream used for 
atomization of the oil will generally be at a pressure of at 
least 4 bar, and preferably it is 6 bar or more. The 
pressure does not vary cyclically with the engine operation. 
The air pressure required for the oil atomization may 
however be lower than 4

<CLAIMS>
A two-stroke engine having a pressurised air rail 
for producing an atomized fuel spray for injection into the 

individual combustion chambers, characterised in that oil 
for lubrication is atomized by metering it into a stream of 

compressed air taken from the rail or a reservoir connected 
thereto and the resulting oil-air mist is injected into the 

crankcase and/or the lower part of the cylinder selectively 
and directly on to points requiring lubrication. 
A two-stroke engine according to claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein each cylinder of the engine is provided 

with a plurality of lubricating nozzles or jets directing 
the atomized oil locally to one or more of the small-end 

bearing, the big-end bearing and the area of the cylinder or 
cylinder liner contacted by the piston skirt. 
A two-stroke engine according to claim 2, further 
including lubricating nozzles or jets directing the atomized 

oil to the crankshaft main bearings. 
A two-stroke engine according to any preceding 
claim, in which the compressed air stream flows continuously 

through the lubricating nozzles or jets. 
A two-stroke engine according to any preceding 
claim, in which the compressed air source for atomization of 

the oil is maintained at a pressure of at least 6 bar. 
A supercharged two-stroke engine according to any 
preceding claim, in which the supply of compressed air for 

atomising the oil is supplemented by compressed air from the 
supercharger.
