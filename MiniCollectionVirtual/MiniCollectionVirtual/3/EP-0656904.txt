<DESCRIPTION>
 PEPTIDE INHIBITORS OF SELECTIN BINDINGBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to peptides which inhibit binding of selectins such as P-selectin, E-selectin and L- selectin.The adherence of platelets and leukocytes to vascular surfaces is a critical component of the inflammatory response and is part of a complex series of reactions involving the simultaneous and interrelated activation of the complement, coagulation, and immune systems.The complement proteins collectively play a leading role in the immune system, both in the identification and in the removal of foreign substances and immune complexes, as reviewed by Muller-Eberhard, H.J., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57: 321-347 (1988) . Central to the complement system are the C3 and C4 proteins, which when activated covalently attach to nearby targets, marking them for clearance. In order to help control this process, a remarkable family of soluble and membrane-bound regulatory proteins has evolved, each of which interacts with activated C3 and/or C4 derivatives. The coagulation and inflammatory pathways are regulated in a coordinate fashion in response to tissue damage. For example, in addition to becoming adhesive for leukocytes, activated endothelial cells express tissue factor on the cell surface and decrease their surface expression of thrombomodulin, leading to a net facilitation of coagulation reactions on the cell surface. In some cases, a single 

receptor can be involved in both inflammatory and coagulation processes.Leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelium is a key initial step in migration of leukocytes to tissues in response to microbial invasion. Although a class of inducible leukocyte receptors, the CD11-CD18 molecules, are thought to have some role in adherence to endothelium, mechanisms of equal or even greater importance for leukocyte adherence appear to be due to inducible changes in the endothelium itself.Activated platelets have also been shown to interact with both neutrophils and monocytes in vitro . The interaction of platelets with monocytes may be mediated in part by the binding of thrombospondin to platelets and monocytes, although other mechanisms have not been excluded. The mechanisms for the binding of neutrophils to activated platelets are not well understood, except that it is known that divalent cations are required. In response to vascular injury, platelets are known to adhere to subendothelial surfaces, become activated, and support coagulation.Platelets and other cells may also play an important role in the
