<ABSTRACT>
Use is made of a device (15) with a clamping and denting unit (16) and with an end-expansion and ironing unit (17). A starting tube (1) is first of all fixed locally by means of the clamping and denting unit (16). An ironing ring (30) is then moved along a freely projecting end section (31) of the starting tube (1) with the aid of an ironing cylinder (22) of the end-expansion and ironing unit (17), and a mandrel (26) is then driven into the end section (31) with the aid of a mandrel cylinder (21) of the end-expansion and ironing unit (17). Once the mandrel (26) has reached its end position, in which the inside diameter and the outside diameter of the end section (31) are enlarged, the ironing ring (30) is drawn over the end section (31), the outside diameter being reduced to the original outside diameter of the starting tube (1). Following this, the mandrel (26) too is withdrawn from the end section (31) and two dents are produced on the outer circumference of the end section (31) of the starting tube (1) with the aid of the clamping and denting unit (16). Together with a drawing point produced by forming the free end of the starting tube (1), these dents form a plug chamber into which are embedded a plurality of drawing plugs that interact with drawing dies during the cascade drawing.

Method for the production of a stopper chamber (12) which 
accommodates at least two drawing stoppers (2, 3, 4) and is bounded 

on one side by a drawing tang (13) and on the other side by an 
indentation (14) made in the external circumference of a starting 

tube (1) during cascade drawing of tubes (1) made of non-ferrous 
metals or alloys thereof, characterised in that the end portion (31) 

of the starting tube (1) lying at the front in the direction of 
travel (DR) is first expanded enlarging the inside diameter (ID) and 

the outside diameter (AD), and then the outside diameter (AD1) of 
the expanded end portion (31) is stretched to the original outside 

diameter (AD) lengthening this end portion (31), whereupon the 
indentation (14) is produced, then the drawing stoppers (2, 3, 4) 

are introduced into the stopper chamber (12) and lastly the drawing 
tang (13) is formed. 
Device for implementing the method according to patent claim 1, 
which exhibits a clamping and indenting unit (16) for the starting 

tube (1) and an expanding and stretching unit (17) which is disposed 
coaxial with the clamping and indenting unit (16) and is 

displaceable relative to it, the clamping and indenting unit (16) 
being provided with clamping jaws (18) and indenting tools (20) 

movable radially relative to the starting tube (1), and the 
expanding and stretching unit (17) being provided with an expander 

(26) displaceable in the longitudinal axis of the starting tube (1), 
and with a stretching die (30) displaceable on the circumferential 

side of the expander (26) and the portion (31) of the length of the 
starting tube (1) projecting on the front side of the clamping and 

indenting unit (16). 
Device according to patent claim 2, characterised in that the 
expanding and stretching unit (17) exhibits two hydraulically 

actuated cylinders (21, 22) coupled to one another in the 
longitudinal axis of the starting tube (1) with piston rods (25, 27) 

which can be extended in opposite directions, the piston rod (25)  
 

which can be extended in the direction of the clamping and indenting 
unit (16) carrying the expander (26), and the other piston rod (27) 

being connected to the stretching die (30) by means of a rod 
assembly (29) parallel with the cylinders (21, 22).
