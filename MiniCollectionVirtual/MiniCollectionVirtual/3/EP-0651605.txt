<ABSTRACT>
There is referred to a process for supplying water to a closed pond (1) for the breeding of fish, and the process is characterised in that the water is supplied to the pond (1), preferably in a horizontal tangential direction, so that the volume of water of the pond (1) is set in a rotating motion, that the level of water in the pond (1) is controlled by regulating the speed of the rotating motion of the water, for example by dispersing the ingoing current of water in one or more directions, and that the water is conducted freely through an exhaust (8) designed in the bottom portion of the pond (1). There is also referred to an arrangement for carrying out the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
for the supply of water to a closed pond for
the breeding of fish. The water is supplied to the pond so
that the volume of the water of the pond is put in a rotating
motion.The invention is of particular concern with a pond
type which is arranged floating in water, such as fresh
water or sea water, for breeding fish, such as salmon and
trout, but can also be adapted for land-based installation.For breeding fish in the sea it is usual to employ
open ponds which consist of a net bag and associated
floating bodies besides. The open net bag causes fresh sea
water continuously and by means of currents and waves to
move through the net bag. In this way fish which are held
within the net bag, necessarily supplied by sea water, are
safeguarded. A breeding installation consists as a rule of
several separate ponds.The breeding of fish in open ponds has been found to
involve a series of problems. It is difficult to control
the environment for the fish. Water temperature, salinity
and oxygen content of the sea water will be variable over
the year and during the course of a day. In addition algae
have good growth conditions in the spring and summer. Some
algae types are poisonous and fatal to fish. Also salmon
lice often exist in open breeding installations. The operation 
of open breeding installations at sea often leads
over time also to a stress of the environment in the
vicinity of the installation. This stress is due to
organic waste in the form of residues of fish feed, plus
solid or liquid excrement from the fish. Organic waste
which lies on the sea bottom in the vicinity of the breeding
installation will over time decay. Problems of pollution
from fish breeding are described in a series of newspaper
articles and professional articles, including the
Norwegian newspaper " Bergens Arbeiderblad", 12 October
1988, page 9. The problems with breeding in open ponds
exhibit themselves in the form of various diseases in
fish. Diseases can be spread by infection being transmitted
from one installation to another. These diseases
often lead to heavy mortality among fish and consequent
difficulties with the economic operation of open breeding
installations.Solving of the problems of breeding based on floating,
open ponds have been attempted by constructing closed
installations, on land or at sea. By closing the installations
the possibility is reduced of both sickness, and the
danger of transmitting disease between the installations.
Land-based breeding installations consist of

<CLAIMS>
Process for conducting water through a substantially circular pond (1)
having impervious side walls for the breeding of fish, where the water by means

of a pump is supplied through a feed pipe (5, 12) to the upper portion of the
pond (1) in a direction so that the volume of water of the pond (1) is set in a

rotating motion, and the water is conducted out of the pond through an exhaust
(8) in the centre of the pond (1) bottom portion, 
characterized
 in that the water
is conducted free flowing out of the pond (1) through the exhaust opening (8),

and in that the water flow through of the pond is controlled by regulating the
speed of the rotating motion of the water, thus also regulating the water level of

the pond.
Process in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the speed of
the water rotating motion is regulated by regulating the speed of the water

supply.
Process in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the speed of
rotation is regulated by conducting the supplied water at regulatable angles

relative to the volume of water in the pond, i.e. in one or more water jet
directions.
Process in accordance with any of claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that the
supply direction(s) of the water is/are changed by control of water guide means

at the intake of the water to the pond (1).
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that
towards the exhaust (8) the rotating motion of the water is converted to a

substantially vertical rectilinear motion.
Process in accordance with claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the vertical
motion is produced by causing the rotating water to flow towards guide plates

(7). 
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in
that on starting up the operation of the pond (1) the water is supplied in

substantially one direction, such as in a tangential horizontal direction, in order
to rapidly establish a rotating motion in the water, and in order to fill the pond

(1) with water, and when the pond (1) is sufficiently full, a portion of the inflowing
water is conducted in another direction, such as a countercurrent, so as

to produce a stable operative condition with respect to the water through flow,
i.e. the water level and the speed of rotation.
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in
that a water flow of up to 100 m
3
 per minute is supplied to the pond, the pond
having a total pond water volume of about 1300 m
3
.
