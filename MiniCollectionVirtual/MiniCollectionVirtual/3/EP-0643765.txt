<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a substantially pure yeast product and a modified cultured yeast product from a lactose-containing substrate. The process includes filtering the substrate, inoculating the substrate with a yeast strain and fermenting it under yeast growth conditions in a bioreactor. The product of the bioreactor is then separated into a yeast cream and a centrate. A portion of the yeast cream is further processed to produce a substantially pure yeast product. The centrate is concentrated and combined with the remainder of the yeast cream to produce a yeast cream/centrate mixture. This mixture is further processed to produce a modified cultured yeast product. The combination of the yeast cream and the concentrated centrate produces a new product having potential for human and animal consumption. The further use of the centrate to produce a food supplement also reduces the amount of environmentally-undesirable waste discharge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing yeast products and modified cultured yeast
products from lactose-containing substrates. The
invention is further directed to reducing or eliminating
environmentally-undesirable waste discharge during a
yeast production process.Lactose is the primary milk sugar in milk and
milk products. It is used in food supplements and in
pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose also provides a
nutritional medium for a host of microorganisms, among
them yeast. Although lactose can provide a nutritional
medium for yeast in the form of whole milk, other
lactose-containing substrates, notably whey, can be
utilized.Whey is the residual liquid or by-product after
removal of fat and casein from whole milk. The major
components in whey are lactose (approximately 75% on a
total solids basis), protein (approximately 13%) and ash
(approximately 9%). The ratio between the components
varies depending on the process involved. Examples of
whey by-products include acid or sweet whey,
deproteinized whey, whey permeate, deproteinized and
partially delactosed whey, and other products which have
a reduced lactose content.Because whey has a low protein content, it is
precluded from being accepted as a high-grade food
product. Additionally, only a part of the whey can be
used for the production of valuable products such as whey
powder, whey protein concentrates and lactose.
Unfortunately, the quantity of whey produced during a
dairy operation usually exceeds any significant demand
for the by-product. Further, the market demand for whey
products does not justify the expense of either
transporting liquid whey from the factory or drying the 
whey. Thus, a significant amount of the whey or its
derivatives must be eliminated.Because of its high organic content, whey
cannot simply be disposed in a waste treatment plant
without polluting the environment. Pollution is usually
expressed in parts per million Biochemical Oxygen Demand
(ppm BOD). The BOD value of whey is on the order of
50,000 ppm, which is much too high to allow whey to be
eliminated by normal sewage treatment plants. The liquid
is usually field sprayed, which can be an expensive
operation. Therefore, effective methods of efficiently
utilizing whey are sought.One method is to utilize the whey or its
derivatives as a growth medium for microorganisms in a
fermentation process. For example, whey can be used in a
fermentation process with lactose-utilizing yeast strains
to produce a marketable yeast product. Examples of such
processes
