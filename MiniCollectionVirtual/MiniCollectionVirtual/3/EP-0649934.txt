<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dosing devices which can 
be securely but releasably attached to containers, 
preferably bottles. Due to the inadequate dispensing mechanisms of washing 
machines for liquid detergent compositions, detergent 
manufacturers have developed alternative dosing and 
dispensing devices which are independent of the washing 
machine. These dosing and dispensing devices are placed 
directly in the drum of the washing machine and been proven 
very effective in delivering the detergent composition 
during the washing process.  The dosing and dispensing devices may also be used for 
dispensing granules, particularly compact granular 
formulations which tend not to readily dissolve in the wash. When not in use, the dosing and dispensing devices need to 
be conveniently stored. Preferably the dosing and dispensing 
devices are attached to a container containing the fabric 
treatment which the dosing and dispensing device will 
dispense. Thereby the dosing and dispensing device occupies 
the smallest space and prevents loss. Particularly with 
bottles, the most effective means is to place the dosing and 
dispensing device over the neck of the bottle and fasten 
thereto by clipping means. GB 2 157 718 describes two piece dosing and dispensing 
devices which are attached to containers. These two piece 
devices comprise a piece referred to as a dosing device 
funnel which is placed in the dosing and dispensing device's 
opening. The dosing and dispensing device is placed over the 
container neck and the funnel comprises means which clip 
onto the lid of the container as described for example in 
EP-O-201 376. However there are a number of disadvantages with this 
system. Firstly the two piece dosing and dispensing device 
are more expensive for the manufacturer to produce and thus 
represent an additional cost. Furthermore one piece dosing 
and dispensing devices require less material for their 
production and thus have a reduced environmental impact. In 
addition such two piece dosing and dispensing devices are 
not firmly attached to the container and can be very easily 
dislodged. In addition two piece dosing and dispensing 
devices result in difficulties for the consumer to 
accurately measure the amount of fabric treatment 
composition required in the device.  Thus, it is an object of the present invention to securely 
but releasably attach a one piece dosing and dispensing 
device to a container. It is an additional object of the present invention to 
attach a one piece dosing and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A packaging assembly suitable for packaging fabric 
treatment compositions, said assembly comprising a container 

for said fabric treatment composition and a separate dosing 
and dispensing device, wherein: 

said container comprises a neck with a dispensing orifice, 
and a self-draining transition piece cooperating with said 

neck so as to provide a ridge, the upper edge of which is 
formed by the bottom edge of said transition piece, and 

said device is a single piece device comprising at least one 
expandable opening, said opening having a perimeter in its 

non-expanded state, which is larger than the perimeter of 
the upper edge of the transition piece and slightly smaller 

than the perimeter of the bottom edge of said transition 
piece, 

whereby said dosing and dispensing device can be releasably 
clipped onto said container into said ridge. 
A packaging assembly according to claim 1, wherein the outer 
surface of said bottom edge of said transition piece is 

substantially similar in shape to the opening of said dosing 
and dispensing device such that said transition piece 

cooperates with said dosing and dispensing device. 
A packaging assembly according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the perimeter of the neck not in contact 

with said bottom edge is slightly larger than the perimeter 
of the neck in contact with said bottom edge.
