<ABSTRACT>
An image processing technique is described in 
the context of a hierarchical image storage and 

retrieval system. The method allows for the controlled 
addition and removal of digital watermarks from 

selected image components in the hierarchy. The method 
adds a digital watermark in a selected image resolution 

component and the means to remove it in an additional 
image component termed the watermark removal component. 

The method employs the encryption of the watermark 
removal component, and decryption with a special key, 

or password during authorized retrieval. This 
technique allows users of a distributed system the 

convenience of providing the entire image hierarchy on 
a single storage medium permitting images containing 

watermarks to be accessed without restriction for 
browsing and proofing, while the watermark removal 

requires knowledge and us of a controlled code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to U.S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/026,726, entitled 
"Method and Apparatus for Controlling Access to 
Selected Image Components In An Image Storage and 
Retrieval System" filed March 5, 1993, by P. W. 
Melnychuck and assigned to Kodak, the assignee of the 
present application. The present invention is related to the field 
of digital image processing and more particularly to 
methods and associated apparatuses for adding and 
removing a digital watermark to and from a selected 
image resolution and the preventing of unauthorized use 
of associated higher resolution digital image 
components. A number of hierarchical techniques for image 
coding have been described in the open technical 
literature and in various patents. Of particular 
relevance to the present invention are the following 
publications:  P. J. Burt and E. H. Adelson, "The Laplacian 
Pyramid As A Compact Code," IEEE Trans. Comm., COM-31, 
532-540 (1983). J. Seberry and J. Pieprzyk, "CRYPTOGRAPHY: An 
introduction to Computer Security" Prentice Hall, 1988 
and the following patents: U.S. Pat No, 4,969,204 entitled "Hybrid 
Residual-Based Hierarchical Storage And Display Method 
For High Resolution Digital Images In A Multiuse 
Environment," by Paul W. Melnychuck and Paul W. Jones, 
1990. U.S. Pat No, 5,048,111 entitled "Hybrid 
Subband-Based Hierarchical Storage And Display Method 
For High Resolution Digital Images In A Multiuse 
Environment," by Paul W. Jones and Paul W. Melnychuck, 
1991. The publication by Burt, et al. teaches an 
encoding method for images termed the Laplacian 
pyramid, the Burt pyramid, or the residual pyramid. In 
this technique, the original image is lowpass filtered, 
and this lowpass image is subsampled to take advantage 
of its reduced bandwidth to provide an image of reduced 
dimension. This process of lowpass filtering and 
subsampling is repeated three times to generate a 
hierarchical structure, or pyramid of images of 
successively smaller dimensions. The total number of 
resolution levels are created depending on the 
application. Each lowpass image in this pyramid is 
then expanded to the dimensions of the next higher 
level by upsampling (inserting zeros) and filtering to 
form a-prediction image for that level. This 
prediction image is subtracted from its corresponding  
 
lowpass image in a subtractor to generate difference, 
or residual, images. The residual images corresponding 
to the levels of the lowpass pyramid form another 
pyramid which is termed the

least one low resolution digital image and at least one 

high resolution digital image, with said high 
resolution digital image encoded with a watermark that 

requires an authorization code for removal. 
2. The storage medium according to claim 1 
and further having stored thereon at least one 

additional high resolution digital image that is not 
encoded with a watermark and is accessed with the 

authorization code in place of the high resolution 
digital image encoded with the watermark. 
3. A storage medium having stored therein at 
least one low resolution digital image and at least one 

high resolution digital image in the form of a BASE 
image, residual image components and a watermark 

component, with said low resolution digital image, said 
BASE image or said high resolution image formed by the 

combination of the BASE image with said residual image 
components and a watermark component being accessible 

without an authorization code.
