<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a polypeptide having 
an amino acid sequence including a complementarity 

determining region (CDR) sequence of a native antibody 
having an amino acid substitution, the polypeptide having 

a binding affinity for a metal chelate of EDTA or an EDTA 
analog that is about equal to or altered from the binding 

affinity of the native antibody.

<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this disclosure various 
publications are referred to by their bibliographic 
citations within parenthesis. These publications are 
hereby incorporated by reference to more fully describe the 
state of the art to which this invention pertains. The present invention is directed towards 
antibodies and antibody fragments useful in the diagnosis 
and treatment of disease. In particular, the present 
invention is directed towards a family of antibodies or 
antibody fragments capable of binding metal chelates. Higher organisms are characterized by an 
immune system which protects them against invasion by 
potentially deleterious substances or microorganisms. When 
a substance, termed an antigen, enters the body, and is 
recognized as foreign, the immune system mounts both an 
antibody-mediated response and a cell-mediated response. 
Cells of the immune system, termed B lymphocytes or B 
cells, produce antibodies which specifically recognize and 
bind to the foreign substance. Other lymphocytes, termed 
T lymphocytes or T cells, both effect and regulate the 
cell-mediated response resulting eventually in the 
elimination of the antigen.  It is known that antibody specificity and 
affinity are governed by the sequence and structure of the 
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable 
sequences in the light and heavy variable domains. The 
structure of the binding region of the antibody involves 
the variable domains of each pair of light and heavy 
chains. The domains on the light and heavy chains have the 
same general structure and each domain comprises four 
regions having conserved sequences, connected by three  
 
hypervariable or complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs). The four framework regions largely adopt a β-sheet 
conformation, and the CDRs form loops connecting and in 
some cases forming part of the β-sheet structure. The CDRs 
are held in close proximity by the framework regions and, 
with the CDRs from the other domain, contribute to the 
formation of the antigen binding site. Analysis of crystal structures of antibodies 
complexed with an antigen or hapten have been used to 
demonstrate that amino acid residues from each CDR contact 
the antigen (See, for example, Davies et al. J. Biol. Chem. 
263 (1988). The interactions between CDR amino acid 
residues and the hapten molecule have been studied for 
several antibody-hapten complexes utilizing crystal 
structures of the complex in conjunction with site-directed 
mutagenesis studies. (See, for example, Glockshuber
