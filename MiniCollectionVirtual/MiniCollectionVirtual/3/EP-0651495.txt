<ABSTRACT>
It is intended to reduce the production costs for a sealed wall bushing for the electrical cable (4, 6) of a centrifugal pump unit (rotary pump unit) which is driven by an electric motor and in the case of which the partially stripped cable conductors (6) have their exposed braids embedded in a body (11) made of insulation material. This is achieved by the insulation being removed only at the ends (8) of the cable conductors (6) and by the braids which are exposed there each being provided with a plug connector (9), those ends of the plug connectors (9) which are connected to the braids being arranged, together with a spacer washer (10) which holds them, within the body (11) which is made of insulation material.

<CLAIMS>
A liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough for a multiple 
core electric cable (4 and 6) extending through the wall of 

an electric motor-driven centrifugal pump unit, the 
insulation of each individual one of the cable cores (6) 

guided by spacer washers (7 and 10) being partially stripped 
and the cable cores (6) including the exposed strands being 

embedded in a body (11) of a castable, curable insulating 
material, characterized in that the insulation is only 

removed at the ends (8) of the cable cores (6) and the 
strands exposed here are respectively provided with a plug 

connector (9), the ends of the plug connectors (9) connected 
with the strands of the plug connector (9) being arranged 

together with a spacer washer (10) holding them within the 
body (11) of insulating material. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 1, characterized in that the plug connectors (9) are 

arranged adjacent to each other in a plurality of rows. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 1, characterized in that the plug connectors (9) are 

arranged in a circle. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 1, characterized by the use of flat plug connectors 

(9). 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 1, characterized by the use of round plug connectors 

(9). 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 1 and any one or more of the claims 2 through 5,  

 
characterized in that the plug connectors (9), together with 

the body (11) surrounding them of insulating material, 
constitute a plug socket. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
any one of the claims 2 through 5, characterized in that the 

entire cable feedthrough is arranged within a separate plug 
housing (1), which is to be coupled using a releasable 

connection with the housing of the centrifugal pump unit and 
an electrical plug conn
ection present there. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 6 or claim 7, characterized in that the parts to be 

coupled together as a plug and socket connection are provided 
with interlocking parts adapted prevent incorrect connection. 
The liquid- and gas-tight feedthrough as claimed in 
claim 7, characterized by a flange-less plug housing, which 

is to be connected with the housing on the centrifugal pump 
unit.
