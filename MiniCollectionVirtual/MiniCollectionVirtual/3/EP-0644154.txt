<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuous process for the preparation of aluminium nitride by the carbonitridation of alumina. According to this process, the reaction, which involves alumina, carbon, a binder and nitrogen, is carried out in a reactor which is characterised in that the reaction region consists of at least one pipe having an exchange surface area/volume ratio of between 5 and 150 m
<
-1
>
 and preferably of between 10 and 50 m
<
-1
>
.

<CLAIMS>
Process for continuously making aluminium
nitride by a carbonitriding reaction starting from

alumina, carbon and nitrogen, 
characterized in that
 the
reaction is carried out in a reactor operating as a

moving-bed reactor and comprising a plurality of conduits,
the reaction zone of each conduit having an exchange

surface area/volume ratio of between 5 and 150 m
-1
.
Preparation process according to Claim
1, 
characterized in that
 the plurality of conduits are
arranged uniformly, so that the centre of each conduit

lies on a circle whose centre is the centre of the
reactor.
Process according to either of Claims 1
and 2, 
characterized in that
 the exchange surface
area/volume ratio varies from 10 to 50 m
-1
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 and
2, 
characterized in that
 the alumina and carbon,
combined with a binder, are employed in the form of

granules having a crushing strength of between 0.2 and
3 MPa and an attrition loss less than 15%.
