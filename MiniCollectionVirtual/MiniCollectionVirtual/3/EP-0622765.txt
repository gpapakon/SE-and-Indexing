<ABSTRACT>
From a paging station a radio display pager receives a sequence 
of repeat calls and non-repeat calls. Each of the repeat and non-repeat 

calls contains a message and a message number identifying the message, 
the same message numbers being repeated for the repeat calls of the 

sequence. The message numbers of received calls are stored in a first 
memory. A currently received call is compared with each of the 

previously stored calls to detect a mismatch. Upon detection of the 
mismatch, a lost call detector determines the message number of a lost 

call which may exist between the currently received call and a call stored 
last in the first memory. The determined message number is stored into 

a second memory as a lost message number. The stored lost message 
number is erased if a call bearing the same message number is received. 

The lost message number than remains in the second memory is put on 
display to allow the owner of the pager to inform the system center of 

the lost message number to obtain the lost message.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to selective calling radio
display pagers, and more particularly to a radio display pager for a
paging system where repeat call transmissions are provided as a system
option and all messages are identified with a serial message number.In radio display paging systems, it is the usual practice to send a
calling signal by multiplexing messages and the address codes of the
message destinations in a frame format Because of the inability of the
paging receiver to acknowledge receipt of a message, a paging system
such as the European Radio Message System provides repeat call
transmissions as a system option to ensure against possible transmission
errors. To enable receivers to identify individual messages, a serial
number is attached to all messages. However, due to transmission errors,
some of the transmitted calls are disrupted and the messages contained
in the calls fail to reach the destination users. If a non-repeat call is lost an
unfavorable situation can occur if the message contained in the lost call is
important to the parties concerned. It is therefore desirable to identify the
lost call and allow the destination user to communicate the lost message
number to the system center to obtain the lost message.However, due to the presence of repeat calls where the same
message number and message are retransmitted, a loss of a single repeat call must be
precisely discriminated against a loss of a non-repeat call.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
radio display pager capable of precisely discriminating a loss of a single 
repeat call and a loss of a non-repeat call.According to the present invention a radio display pager comprises the features claimed in claim 1 or operates according to the method claimed in claim 4. A radio display pager is
described which comprises a receiver for receiving from a paging station a
sequence of repeat calls and non-repeat calls addressed to the radio
pager. Each of the repeat and non-repeat calls contains a message and a
message number identifying the message, and the message numbers of
a call and repeat
calls containing identical messages are equal to each other. The pager
includes a first memory for storing the message numbers of calls received
in sequence by the receiver, and a second memory. A currently received
call is compared with each of the previously stored calls to detect a
mismatch. Upon detection of the mismatch, a lost call detector
determines the message number of a lost call which may exist

<CLAIMS>
A radio display pager comprising:

receiver means (5, 6) for receiving from a paging station a
sequence of repeat calls and non-repeat calls addressed to the radio

pager, each of said repeat and non-repeat calls containing a message
and a message number identifying the message, the message numbers

of a call and repeat calls containing identical messages being equal to each other;
first memory means (8) for storing the message numbers of calls
received by the receiver means (5, 6);
second memory means (13);
mismatch detector means (24, 25) for comparing a call currently
received by the receiver means with each of the calls previously stored in

the first memory means (8) for detecting a mismatch therebetween;
lost call detector means (26, 27, 28, 30) responsive to the
detection of a mismatch by the mismatch detector means (24, 25) for

detecting the message number of a lost call which may exist between a
call currently received by the receiver means (5, 6) and a call stored last in

the first memory means (8), storing the detected message number into
the second memory means (13) as a lost message number, and removing

from the second memory means (13) the lost message number when a
call having the same message number is received by the receiver means;

and
display means (31-35) for displaying the message number which
remains in said second memory means (13).
A radio display pager as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
lost call detector means (26, 27, 28, 30) comprises:


first detector means (26) responsive to the detection of a
mismatch by the mismatch detector means (24, 25) for detecting the 

presence of a lost call when there is a difference of at least one between
the message number of a call currently received by the receiver means

(5, 6) and the message number of a call stored last in the first memory
means (8);
second detector means (27) responsive to the detection of a lost
call by the first detector means (26) for detecting a mismatch

between the message number of the currently received message and a
message number stored in the second memory means (13); and
third detector means (28, 30) responsive to the detection of a lost
call by the second detector means (27) for determining a message number

which exists between the message number of the currently received call
and the message number of the call last stored in the first memory means

(8) and storing the determined message number into the second memory
means (13) as said lost message number, and responsive to the detection

of a match by the second detector means (27) for removing from the
second memory means (13) said lost message number which is equal to

the message number of a call received by the receiver means.
A radio display pager as daimed in claim 1, wherein said lost
call detector means (26, 27, 28, 30) is arranged to:


when a mismatch is found by the mismatch detector means (24, 25),
decide that a message has not been lost when the associated message number

of the currently received message equals a reference number defined as an
associated message number of a last previously stored message plus one, and

decide that a message has been lost otherwise; and
store as a lost message number every sequential number residing
between the associated message number of the currently received message and

the reference number.
A method for detecting and managing lost messages in a radio
pager receiving messages having associated message numbers, comprising the

step of

(a) comparing the associated message number of a presently received
message with associated message numbers of previously received and stored

messages, 
characterized
 by the steps of:
(b) storing as a lost message number any consecutive number
residing between the associated message number of the presendy received

message and a reference number defined by a last previously stored associated
message number plus one; and
(c) erasing a stored lost message number that is equal to the
associated message number of the presently received message.
The method according to claim 4, further comprising the steps
of:


starting a timer when it is determined that a lost message number is
stored in a memory of said radio pager; and
alerting the user that a lost message number exists if it is determined
that a lost message number is stored in the memory after the timer has

reached a predetermined count.
