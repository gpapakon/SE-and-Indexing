<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided which enables ink used in a print 
head disposed in an ink jet printing arrangement to be produced, in 

situ, from an ink concentrate and a diluting agent. Such apparatus 
includes a generally hollow fluid-tight housing member. A 

collapsible ink concentrate container is provided for containing a 
predetermined volume of ink concentrate therein. The container is 

disposed in an interior portion of such housing member. A 
connection is disposed on the housing member and in fluid 

communication with the interior portion of such housing member for 
connecting the housing member to a source of fluid pressure. An 

ink concentrate fluid communication passageway is connected to the 
ink concentrate container for communicating a predetermined volume 

of ink concentrate to a mixing apparatus. A fluid communication is 
established for communicating a diluting agent from the interior 

portion of such housing member to the mixing apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to ink which is
communicated to at least one print head disposed in an ink jet
printing arrangement and, more particularly, this invention relates
to a method of and an apparatus for making such ink, in situ, in
such ink jet printing arrangement from an ink concentrate and a
preselected diluting agent.Prior to the present invention, ink jet printing has been in
use in industry for several years. These ink jet printing
arrangements have normally utilized a premixed ink ready, as
received, for delivery to the printing head. Such premixed ink
being communicated by a pump to the print head disposed in such ink
jet printing arrangement. As is well known, pumps are generally
difficult and costly to maintain due to their numerous moving
components.Applicants are aware of only one ink jet printing arrangement
which does not require the use of a pump. This prior art system
utilizes a series of elastic members surrounding a container of
premixed ink. These elastic members are capable of forcing the ink
from the container to the print head disposed in the printing
arrangement. However, this system requires over filling of the ink
container. The reason such over filling is required is because the 
force being exerted by the elastic members will obviously decrease
as more and more ink is communicated from the container. In
addition to the wasted ink, these containers are always thrown
away. This, therefore, adds to the printing cost.According to US-A-4 422 085, ink concentrate and
diluting agent are supplied to a sub tank, to which also
old ink liquid is returned. Control means are provided to
control the viscosity of the ink liquid delivered from the sub tank.Applicants are also aware of European Patent EP-A-266 344
which teaches a fluid jet printing device. This device utilizes a
fluid container which supplies a premixed ink to the printing
device. Such container is filled with ink and a pressurized gas.
The container has an outlet which is adapted to be detachably
connected to an inlet port of the printing device. As with other
prior art devices, this container is non-refillable and,
therefore, costly to use.Further, such premixed inks normally used in ink jet printing
are solvent based and, therefore, present a number of undesirable
problems from an environmental standpoint and oftentimes from a
safety standpoint. Obviously the extent of these problems will
depend to a large extent on the solvent being used to produce the
ink.Furthermore, because the inks used prior to
