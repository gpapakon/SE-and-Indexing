<ABSTRACT>
A process and system are disclosed for automated running of sports contests. The system has machine readable card-shaped information carriers for each contestant and for control data for each type of contest, at least one reader (14, 16) for the card-shaped data carrier, by means of which contestant data and control data are exclusively input into a computer unit (12), and at least one display device (18, 20) linked to the computer unit (12) for displaying contest data. The individual phases of the contest running are strictly determined by the sequence of the data carriers introduced in the reader(s) (14, 16).

<CLAIMS>
A system for automated running of sports contests, using a 
program-controlled computer unit, comprising: 


machine-readable, preferably card-shaped data carriers 
for each contestant and for control data for each type of 

contest to be performed; 
at least one reader (14, 16) for the card-shaped data 
carriers, by means of which contestant data and control 

data are exclusively input into said computer unit (12); 
and 
at least one display device (18, 20) linked to said 
computer unit (12) for displaying contest data, 
 
characterized in that
 
the individual phases of the contest running are strictly 

determined by the sequence of the respective data carriers 
introduced in said reader(s) (14, 16). 
The system of claim 1, characterized in that said computer 
unit (12) and said reader(s) (14, 16) are accommodated 

within a common closed housing (10), substantially only 
comprising an insertion slot for each reader (14, 16). 
The system of claim 2, characterized in that said display 
device (18) is also integrated in said housing (10). 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that at least one display device (22) is a tele-indicating 

device arranged at the respective contest location. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that said computer unit (12) has also linked thereto a 

printer (22) integrated in the housing, if desired. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized by a 
data carrier identification device for detecting the type 

of data carrier linked to or integrated in said computer 
unit (12), the computer unit only permitting data to be  

 
read from an introduced data carrier, if a data carrier 

associated to the corresponding phase of operation was 
inserted in said reader(s) (14, 16), if not, ejecting the 

data carrier from said reader (14, 16). 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that a type of contest is selected and started in a first 

step by introducing the control data carrier corresponding 
to the desired type of contest, and only then, the 

contestants' data carriers are inserted in said reader(s) 
(14, 16), one after another, to enter the contestant data 

to said computer unit (12). 
The system of claim 7, characterized in that the input of a 
contest result is performed by continuously introducing the 

two contestant data carriers of a pair of contestants, 
wherein, if there are two readers (14, 16), one thereof is 

determined to have introduced the data carrier of the 
winner and the other one that of the loser or, if there is 

only one reader (14), respectively, at first the data 
carrier of the winner and then that of the loser is 

introduced. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized by 
an excluding data carrier erasing a contestant in said 

computer unit (12), if the excluding data carrier is 
inserted in connection with a contestant data carrier, 

i. e. the contestant is excluded from the contest. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized by a 
coin introduction and collection device provided at said 

housing (10), through which device the system may be 

activated in cooperation with said computer unit (12), for 
a predetermined period of time, if desired. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that after termination of a contest, said display device 

(18, 20) remains active to display the contest result for a  
 

predetermined period of time, and then said computer unit 
(12) resets by erasing the data corresponding to the 

terminated contest. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized by 
indicating lights, preferably located near the insertion 

slot(s) for said reader(s) (14, 16) to demand the insertion 
of data carriers corresponding to the respective phase of 

operation. 
A system of any of the preceding claims, characterized by 
selecting means provided at said housing (10), for 

selecting one of several desired types of contest instead 
of or in addition to the data carrier containing control 

data. 
A process for running of a sports contest by using a system 
of any of the preceding claims, characterized by the 

following steps: 

a) introducing a data carrier containing control data in a 
reader (14, 16); 
b) verifying the type of data carrier by said computer unit 
(12); 
c) introducing data carriers containing contestant data in 
said reader(s) (14, 16), and recording the contestant 

data by said computer unit (12); 
d) determining the teams of the first contest round by said 
computer unit (12), and indicating them on said display 

device (18, 20); 
e) inserting the contestant data carriers of the winner and 
the loser in a predetermined association to said 

reader(s) (14, 16); 
f) displaying the contest result on said display device 
(18, 20) under control of said computer unit (12); and 
g) printing, if desired, the contest result by said 
printing device (22), under control of said computer 

unit (12). 
The process of claim 14, characterized in that a data 
carrier introduced in a reader (14, 16), but not 

corresponding to the respective phase of operation, is 
recognized and ejected.
