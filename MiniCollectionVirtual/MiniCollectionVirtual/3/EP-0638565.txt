<ABSTRACT>
Gamma-butyrolactone is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the vapour phase in the presence of catalysts based on copper chromite in reduced form, the reaction being carried out with the aid of an essentially uniform catalyst essentially derived from the 3 components copper oxide, chromium oxide and silicon dioxide. The ratio of CuO to Cr2O3 to SiO2 is preferably approximately 78 : 20 : 2. The concomitant use of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, as a diluent may be advantageous.
