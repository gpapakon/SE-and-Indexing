<ABSTRACT>
In an improved power transmission belt (10), the 
circumferentially disposed reinforcing cords (30) 

are made from multi-filament 
yarns (32) of heterofilaments. These cords, when fused, have 

good inter-filament bonding without the solvent of the 
solvent/adhesive systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to heterofilament yarns
being used for the cord reinforcement in power transmission
belts.Power transmission belts, for example V-belts and
ribbed V-belts, are well known (See: Wake, N.C., et al.,
"Textile Reinforcement of Elastomers", Applied Science
Publishers, Englewood, NJ, 1982). Such power transmission
belts typically comprise rubber impregnated
fabric layers disposed on the belt's innermost and outermost
circumerential surfaces, and a layer of a masticated
rubber/staple fiber mixture and a layer of circumferentially
disposed reinforcing cord being sandwiched
therebetween. The reinforcing cord or "stiff cord" is typically
made from an adhesive impregnated, multi-filament
yarn. Exemplary yarns include filaments of nylon,
polyester, and rayon, polyester being preferred because
of its superior properties.Generally, these belts are made by laying up the
above-mentioned layers, in an inverted order, on a
drum. First, a layer of rubber impregnated fabric is laid
on the drum. Then, the reinforcing cords are laid up.
'Next, a layer of masticated rubber/staple fiber is laid up.
Finally, a second layer of rubber impregnated fabric is
applied to the construction. The foregoing is then vulcanized,
thereby forming a "large tube". From this tube,
individual belts are cut.One problem with this type of belt is "cord pop-out".
"Cord pop-out", or fraying of cord from the belt's cut
edge, seriously diminishes the belt's useable life span
because the loss of cord from the belt accelerates wear
on the belt leading to its ultimate failure. Cord pop-out
and situations which lead to cord pop-out can arise during
manufacture and use of the belt. In manufacture,
when belts are cut from the tube, the cord or the yarn in
the cord can be stripped away. In use, as the belts
leaves the sheave, the cord or the yarn may "pop-aut"
of the belt because of the reduction of lateral compressive
force on the belt."Cord pop-out" is such a serious concern that the
reinforcing cords or "stiff cords" are impregnated with an
adhesive to facilitate inter-filament bonding. Inter-filament
bonding within the yarn and cord reduces the possibility
of individual filaments popping from the belt and
beginnig to fray from the belt. Typical adhesives for interfilament
bonding include isocyanate systems which are
normally applied to the cord in a solvent carrier. The solvent/isocyanate
systems is necessary so that the isocyanate
penetrates in between the filaments of the yarn
and thereby facilitates inter-filament bonding

<CLAIMS>
An article of manufacture comprising a cord (30) adapted for reinforcing a power
transmission belt by being circumferentially disposed within said belt, said cord

comprising a side-by-side or sheath/core bi-component heterofilament (34) wherein
one portion of the side-by-side heterofilament or the core portion (38) of the

sheath/core heterofilament comprises a relatively high melting point polymer
component which is polyethylene terephthalate and the other portion of the side-by-side

heterofilament or the sheath portion (36) of the sheath/core heterofilament is
fusible and comprises a relatively low melting point polymer which is polybutylene

terephthalate.
The article according to claim 1, wherein the cord comprises yarns (32), said yarns
being multifilament yarns comprising heterofilaments (34) having fusible portions as

described in claim 1 whereby the heterofilaments can bond with one another when
heated under pressure.
The article according to claim 1, wherein the cord comprises yarns (32), said yarns
being multifilament yarns comprising heterofilaments (34) as described in claim 1

which are bonded to one another by fusion of their fusible portions.
The article according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein each heterofilament (34) is a
sheath/core heterofilament of which the sheath surrounds a core.
The article according to claim 4, wherein the polyethylene terephthalate has a
melting point 30Â°C greater than that of the polybutylene terephthalate.
A power transmission belt (10) having circumferentially disposed reinforcing cords
(30) as defined in any of claims 1 to 5. 
The power transmission belt (10) according to claim 6 which is a cut edge V-belt.
Multifilament yarn (32) comprising sheath/core heterofilaments (34) having a
fusible sheath portion (36) and composed of a relatively high melting point polymer

component and a relatively low melting point component, wherein said relatively low
melting point component is polybutylene terephthalate and comprises said sheath

portion and the relatively high melting point component is polyethylene terephthalate
and comprises the core (38) of the sheath/core heterofilaments.
