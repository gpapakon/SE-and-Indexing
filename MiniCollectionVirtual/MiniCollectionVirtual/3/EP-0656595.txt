<ABSTRACT>
When a character key is operated, the apparatus reads 
display character size data for the inputted character, which 

corresponds to a selected print character size, in S40. 
Display dot pattern data corresponding to the starting 

character code in a text memory is then read out. The thus 

read out data is stored in the location designated by a 
display position pointer value of a display data buffer in 

S42. The print fullwidth data for the inputted character 
code is then read out in S43 so as to calculate the display 

fullwidth data for display in S44. The display fullwidth 
data is added to the display position pointer value to 

determine the next display position pointer value in S45. 
The display dot pattern data corresponding to the next 

character code is placed into the location designated by the 
next display position pointer value in S42.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printing
apparatus and, more particularly, to a tape printing
apparatus for inputting desired characters, such as letters
and symbols, displaying the inputted characters on a display
for the operator's confirmation, and printing the inputted
characters onto a tape.United States Patent No. 5,066,152 has proposed a
tape printing apparatus employed with a keyboard, a display
unit and a print mechanism. Characters, such as letters and
symbols, inputted through the keyboard are displayed on the
display unit, while being printed, by the print mechanism, on
a print medium housed in a tape cassette (e.g., a tape 18 or
24 mm wide). The tape printing apparatus is suitable for
printing file names, for example, on the tape to make labels
for classifying file binders.More specifically, the display unit is similar to
what is commonly used with word processors or the like. The
characters inputted through the keyboard are displayed in
matrix format in a predetermined character size (e.g., 16-dot
size). The print character size, font and other format
setting information are also displayed by the use of control 
characters ("F", etc.). The inputted characters are printed on
the tape, in the print character size and in the font based on the
format setting information .From EP 0 497 352 A a tape printing apparatus is known for printing
desired characters onto a tape. The apparatus comprises input
means for inputting characters, data storage means for storing indicative
of characters inputted by the input means. The characters
may be displayed on display means. For printing on a tape the tape
width data are compared with the printing-width data in order to prepare the print data. If the
printing-width data are larger than the tape-width data an error
message is displayed because printing is not possible. For displaying
the data on the display line character size data are obtained
by an arithmetic unit, however, the display data are prepared
such that the display size is constant and does not depend from the
print size.From EP 0 506 460 A a tape printing apparatus for printing desired
characters onto a tape is known. The sizes of the characters and
the intervals between the characters are calculated according to
the available space. Margins are adjusted so that the characters
can be printed. The inputted characters are display on display
means. The size of the displayed characters is constant and related
to the size of the printed characters. The present inventors have motivated the
