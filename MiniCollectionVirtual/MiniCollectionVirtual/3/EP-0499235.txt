<ABSTRACT>
An electric vacuum cleaner includes a main body 
having an electric blower and a dust collecting chamber, a 

triac for controlling the electric blower, a floor nozzle 
coupled to the main body, an electric current sensor for 

sensing electric current in a rotary brush driving motor 
in the floor nozzle, and a microcomputer. The 

microcomputer detects a period of variation of the motor 
current and the maximum electric current value for every 

predetermined period on the basis of an output from the 
electric current sensor, performs fuzzy inference on the 

detected values, and determines the duty cycle of the 
blower control triac on the basis of a result of it. 

Supply of electric power to the electric blower according 
to using conditions of the floor nozzle and kinds of a 

floor surface is realized by this.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric vacuum 
cleaner and, more particularly, to an electric vacuum 
cleaner in which input to an electric blower is 
automatically controlled at least in accordance with using 
conditions of a floor nozzle. Conventionally, a technique has been proposed for 
improving convenience of use of an electric vacuum cleaner 
by changing input to an electric blower, i.e. supply 
power, in accordance with the magnitude of the load of 
suction and the amount of collected dust in a dust 
collecting chamber. Such a conventional technique as 
proposed includes an approach that a pressure detecting 
device is provided in an air inlet passage between an 
electric blower and a filter, the pressure in the dust 
collecting chamber is detected by the pressure detecting 
device, and input to the electric blower is controlled in 
accordance with the detected pressure value, and an 
electric vacuum cleaner using such a technique is  
 
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 
57-75623 (1982). In such a conventional technique, however, input to 
the electric blower is controlled merely in accordance 
with detection of the pressure in the dust collecting 
chamber, and it is difficult to perform optimum input 
control adapted to actual conditions of a floor nozzle 
performing dust collection and a floor surface subject to 
dust collection. For example, in the case of the surface of a floor of 
a floorboard, a suction port of the electric vacuum 
cleaner tends to cling to the floor surface, and once it 
clings to the floor, the pressure in an air inlet passage 
is lowered. In such a case, input to the electric blower 
is increased in accordance with decrease of a detected 
output of a pressure detecting device to make the suction 
power still greater, so that the suction port comes to 
cling to the floor surface still harder in the above-described 
conventional technique. As described above, 
there is a problem that, in the conventional electric 
vacuum cleaner, input control of the electric blower 
adapted to actual conditions of the floor nozzle and the 
floor surface is not performed, and convenience of use of 
it is not sufficiently improved. Another approach proposed is disclosed in Japanese  
 
Patent Laying-Open No. 64-52430 (1989), for example, in 
which suction power in accordance with actual conditions 
of a floor nozzle and a floor surface is realized by 
sensing a change in electric current in a driving motor of 
a dust collecting rotary brush provided in a
