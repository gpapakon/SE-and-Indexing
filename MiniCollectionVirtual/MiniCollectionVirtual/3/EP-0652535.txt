<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a main computer (10) located at the cash and carry operator, with an associated optical main reader (30) and an associated label printer (20), as well as a hand-held computer (50) located at the retailer, with an associated optical hand-held reader (60) and an associated list printer (70). The two computers (10,50) are communicatively connected via a transportable storage medium (D).   By means of the hand-held reader (60), product data which are present on products or their packaging in encoded form can be registered and transferred into the hand-held computer (50). On the basis of the registered data and on the basis of product-range-specific product data stored in the hand-held computer, a purchase list (71) for the retailer can be compiled automatically and printed out via the list printer (70). The hand-held computer (50) can also be used for compiling inventory lists and, in conjunction with a voucher printer (80), for compiling sales vouchers in plain text. The optical main reader (30) at the cash and carry operator registers products bought by the retailer. On the basis of the registered product data and on the basis of product-range-specific product data stored in it, the main computer (10) in conjunction with the label printer (20) compiles automatically updated shelf-price labels (SPL) for the retailer and also automatically updates its product-range-specific stock of data on the storage medium (D). The device permits, in particular, a more efficient and less complicated management of the adaptation operations which are necessary for the retailer for example in the case of range changes and price changes.

memory medium,
interacts with an optical hand scanner (60) for reading article data provided on
the retailer's shelf price tickets (RPS) into the hand computer (50)
and interacts with a list printer (70) for printing a goods shopping list (71) for
the retailer,
the main computer (10) being equipped

to write assortment-specific article data relevant to the retailer via the cited first
write/read device (13) onto the transportable memory medium and
to print, based on data which are entered or read in by means of an optical main
scanner (30) interacting with that computer and which pertain to a purchase of

goods made by the retailer at the cash 
&
 carry wholesaler's and also based on
the merchandise assortment-specific article data contained in the main

memory (12), via the ticket printer (20) corresponding shelf price tickets (RPS)
pertaining to the purchased goods,
and the hand computer (50) being equipped 

to read in the merchandise assortment-specific article data contained on the
transportable memory medium (D) via the cited second write/read (54) device

and
to print, based on these merchandise assortment-specific article data and on
article data which are read off from the retailer's shelf price tickets (RPS) by

means of the optical hand scanner (60) as well as on manually entered amounts,
via the list printer (70) a shopping list (71) for the retailer which is sorted

according to specified criteria, in particular according to article groups.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it comprises a receipt printer
(80) interacting with the hand computer (50), which hand computer (50) is equipped

to print, based on article data read off by means of the optical hand scanner (60) from
code fields (40) provided on articles (EW), optionally in conjunction with the

merchandise assortment-specific article data stored in the hand computer (50), via the
receipt printer (80) a plain language receipt (81) pertaining to goods sold to a

customer of the retailer.

characterised in that
 the transportable
non-volatile memory medium (D) is a memory card composed of electrically

readable and writable memory components.
A device according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterised in that
 the hand
computer (50) is equipped to manufacture an inventory protocol based on article data

read off by means of the optical hand scanner (60) from code fields (40) provided on
articles (EW), optionally in conjunction with merchandise assortment-specific article

data stored in the hand computer (50) and with manually entered amounts, and to
print said inventory protocol via the list printer (70).
