<ABSTRACT>
The contact pads (86) of a print cartridge (24) are 
formed on a flexible tape. Each of the uniformly spaced 

contact pads (86) is preferably a square separated from an 
adjacent square by a minimum distance to provide each 

contact pad with a maximum area. The contact pads (86) 
are arranged on the flexible tape (87) only along the side 

portions of the plastic print cartridge body (106), where 
the body (106) is generally flat, to avoid the pads being 

located in the sunken middle portion (112) of the body 
(106), where the sinking occurs during the injection 

molding process used to form the body. This improves the 
reliability of the interconnection between the pads (86) 

and the printer electrodes (85).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ink 
printers and, more particularly, to the arrangement of contact 
pads on a print cartridge. Ink-jet printheads operate by ejecting a droplet of 
ink through a nozzle and onto a recording medium, such as a 
sheet of paper. When a number of nozzles are arranged in a 
pattern, such as one or more linear arrays, the properly 
sequenced ejection of ink from each nozzle causes characters 
of other images to be printed on the paper as the printhead 
is moved relative to the paper. The paper is typically 
shifted each time the printhead has moved across the paper. 
The printhead is usually part of a disposable print cartridge 
containing a supply of ink, where the print cartridge is 
easily installed in and removed from the printer. In one design of a thermal ink-jet print cartridge 
the print cartridge includes: 1) an ink reservoir and ink  
 
channels to supply ink proximate to each of the nozzles; 
2) a nozzle plate in which the nozzles are formed in a 
certain pattern; and 3) a substrate attached to a bottom 
surface of the nozzle plate, where a series of thin film 
heaters are formed on the substrate, generally one below 
each nozzle. Each heater includes a thin film resistor 
and appropriate current leads. To print a single dot of 
ink, an electrical current from an external power supply 
is passed through a selected heater. The heater is 
ohmically heated, in turn superheating a thin layer of the 
adjacent ink. This results in explosive vaporization of 
the ink causing a droplet of ink to be ejected through an 
associated nozzle onto the paper. One example of this type of print cartridge is shown 
in Fig. 1 as print cartridge 10. Print cartridge 10 
generally includes a body 12 which acts as an ink 
reservoir. Body 12 may have formed on it one or more 
projections, such as projection 13, to enable print 
cartridge 10 to be secured in place within an ink printer. 
The printhead portion 14 of print cartridge 10 includes a 
metal nozzle plate 16 (such as a gold-coated nickel 
plate), which has two parallel arrays of nozzles 17 formed 
in it using conventional photolithographic techniques. 
Nozzle plate 16 is attached by an adhesive to an 
underlying substrate (not shown) which includes heater 
resistors paired with each of the nozzles 17. A flexible insulating tape 18 has formed on it a 
number of conductors which terminate in contact pads 20. 
The other ends of the conductors on tape 18 are connected, 
using tape automated bonding (TAB), to electrodes on the 
s

<CLAIMS>
A print cartridge (24) comprising: 

a plastic print cartridge body (106) which has 
been injection molded, said print cartridge body 

(106) including a first side having a depressed 
valley (112) toward a middle portion of said first 

side due to said middle portion sinking during an 
injection molding process to form said print 

cartridge body (106); and 
a flexible circuit (87) secured on at least said 
first side of said print cartridge body (106), 
said flexible circuit (87) having contact pads 
(86) formed thereon for contacting corresponding 

electrodes (85) in an ink printer, said flexible 
circuit (87) having conductive traces terminating in 

said contact pads (86) for connection to a printhead, 
said flexible circuit (87) having a width 
larger than a width of said valley (112) in said 

first side of said print cartridge body (106) so as 
to extend to both sides of said valley (112), said 

contact pads (86) on said flexible circuit (87) not 
being formed where said flexible circuit (87) 

overlies said valley (112). 
The print cartridge of Claim 1 wherein said 
contact pads (86) are substantially square shaped. 
The print cartridge of Claims 1 or 2 wherein said 
contact pads (86) are arranged along sides of said 

flexible circuit (87) and not over said valley (112) so 
that when said print cartridge (24) is inserted into an 

ink printer, all of said contact pads (86) will be in a 
substantially single plane so as to provide more reliable 

contact with corresponding electrodes (85) in said ink 
printer.  

 
The print cartridge of Claim 3 wherein said 
contact pads (86) are separated from an adjacent contact 

pad (86) by a minimum distance to allow for a maximum 
contact pad area. 
The print cartridge of Claims 3 or 4 wherein said 
contact pads (86) are formed in parallel columns on both 

sides of said valley (112).
