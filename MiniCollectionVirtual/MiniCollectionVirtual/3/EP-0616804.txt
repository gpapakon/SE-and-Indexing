<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid as active ingredients 
for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions possessing 
anxiolytic activity and suitable for the treatment of states of 
depression. As known, depression is an emotional disorder implying a state of 
lowered mood, characterized by deep sadness, pessimism, 
restlessness, self-pity, ideational poverty, and by organic 
symptoms, such as insomnia, anorexia, loss of enthusiasm and of 
libido. Depression may be treated by the use of tricyclic antidepressants, 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, some psychotropic drugs, lithium 
carbonate, and by electroconvulsive (ECS or electroshock) therapy 
("Le basi farmaceutiche della terapia", Italian translation of the 
6th U.S. edition of a text by Goodman and Gilman, pp. 440-456). However, the treatment that proved to be most effective and, 
therefore, which is widely adopted, consists of the administration 
of tricyclic antidepressants, in particular imipramine. This drug, like all other tricyclic antidepressants, is highly 
toxic, the median lethal dose (LD₅₀) values being 90 to 110 mg/kg  
 
i.p. and 400 to 490 mg/kg per os. Most of the toxic reactions are referred to the antimuscarinic 
effects of said drugs and to their toxicity to the brain; however, 
also the effects on the heart constitute a serious problem (Goodmann 
and Gilman, ibid., pp. 439-456). Another tricyclic antidepressant, mianserin, exhibits the following 
LD₅₀ values: mouse: 365 to 390 mg/kg per os and 31 to 32.5 mg/kg 
i.v. As disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4.983.632, the pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and, in particular, 
the sodium salt thereof, are used to fight addiction to alcohol and 
to treat the relevant abstinence crisis. It has unexpectedly been found that the pharmaceutically acceptable 
salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid are particularly efficacious in 
the treatment of depression and possess anxiolytic activity, while 
their toxicity is much lower than that of the antidepressants and 
anxiolytics of commerce. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric 
acid for use in the present compositions are lithium-, sodium-, 
potassium-, calcium-, and magnesium salts, the sodium salt being 
particularly preferred. The following tests were carried out to check the activity of 
pharmaceutically acceptable gamma-hydroxybutyric acid salts in the  
 
states of depression:
