<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is the detection of
reactivity between alloantigen and alloantigen-specific
ligand in biological samples.In many transplantation-type situations, there is
concern for differences between the allotype, especially
the HLA type, of a cell source and the cell recipient. In
situations where allogenic cells or tissue are taken from
a donor and introduced into a recipient, it is desirable
that the donor and recipient be as closely HLA matched as
possible. The presence in the patient serum of antibodies
against HLA antigens of the donor (donor specific
crossmatch) or against a high percentage of HLA alleles
(PRA testing) predicts a high risk of graft rejection.The determination of HLA phenotype (HLA typing) is
useful in numerous situations such as transplantation,
platelet transfusion and forensic or paternity testing.
The standard technique for HLA typing and detection of
anti-HLA antibodies is microlymphocytotoxicity, where
serum containing antibodies is incubated with HLA antigen-expressing
lymphocytes, then with complement. The level
of cytotoxicity is then estimated by discriminating
between dead and viable cells using various dyes. This 
method has numerous disadvantages: it is labor intensive;
time consuming; requires isolation of cells; requires
viable cells; is nonspecific for HLA; and requires a
subjective evaluation. Flow cytometry may also be used
but requires a large number of cells and expensive
instrumentation.It is therefore of interest to provide alternative
techniques which can be performed simply, can be automated,
do not share the shortcomings described above, and provide
a readily discernible result which is significant for the
prognosis of graft acceptance.References of interest include Duquesnoy etal. (1990)

<CLAIMS>
A method for detecting the presence in an antiserum of at least one human
antibody to an HLA antigen in a physiological specimen, said method comprising:


combining said specimen with antibody reagent to said at least one HLA
antigen and a solid support comprising said HLA antigen; and
detecting the amount of antibody reagent present on said support as compared
to a control value,

   wherein a reduced amount of antibody reagent bound to said support is
indicative of the presence of said at least one human antibody to an HLA antigen in

said specimen.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said antibody reagent is labelled with
a detectable label.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said detecting comprises:

washing said solid support substantially free of non-specifically bound
antibody reagent;
adding a labeled detector molecule to said washed solid support, wherein said
labelled detector molecule binds to said antibody reagent; and
detecting the amount of antibody reagent present on said support as compared
to a control value by means of said labelled detector molecule.
A method for detecting at least one alloantigen or antibody thereto in a
physiological specimen, said method comprising:


combining said specimen with antibody reagent to said at least one alloantigen
and beads comprising said at least one alloantigen, wherein the ratio of binding sites

between alloantigen on said beads and antibody reagent results in a change in
agglutination in the presence of said allvantigen or antibody thereto; and
detecting the change in agglutination with said sample as compared to the
agglutination in the absence of said sample.
A method for HLA matching of donor and recipient for transplanting an organ,
said method comprising:


identifying the presence of antibodies to one or more HLA antigens in a
recipient blood specimen;
combining a blood sample from said recipient with a physiological sample
from said donor and a cross-section of HLA antigens conjugated to latex beads,

wherein the amount of sample and latex beads is selected to provide for agglutination
when said recipient sample has antibodies to at least one of said latex bead-conjuqated

HLA antigens; and
detecting the presence of anti-HLA antigen antibodies to an HLA antigen of
said donor in said recipient by a reduction in agglutination as compared to the amount

of agglutination in the absence of said donor physiological sample.
A kit for use in a method according to Claim 5, said kit comprising latex beads
coated with a plurality of HLA antigens from a cross-section of individuals.
