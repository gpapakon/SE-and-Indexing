<ABSTRACT>
A braider having a mandrel support member (Bm) which is pivotable 
around a braiding point and linearly movable toward and away 

from the braiding point. Since control of the position of the 
mandrel (m) is performed by pivotal motion around the braiding 

point and linear movement in a direction toward the braiding 
point, the mandrel can be moved to an arbitrary position 

without depending upon movement of the mandrel by a great 
distance in one direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a braider for
crossing a plurality of yarns, fiber bundles or like
elements with each other to braid various braids.Conventionally, various braiders wherein a
plurality of yarns, fiber bundles or like elements are
crossed with each other on a mandrel having a cross
section of a circular, square or some other shape to
braid a braid are known, for instance, from EP-A-0 523 471.In conventional braiders, however, since the
braiding point on the mandrel is spaced away from the
position at which axial lines of bobbins placed on bobbin
carriers and an axial line of the mandrel intersect with
each other, yarns, fiber bundles or like elements
(hereinafter referred to merely as "yarns") unwound from
the bobbins are bent by a great amount, and this gives
rise to such a problem that yarns cannot be unwound
smoothly or that excessive tension is applied to yarns,
and makes an obstruction to appropriate braiding.
Meanwhile, where the yarns are fibers fragile to bending
such as glass fibers, such a trouble that the yarns are
cut by such bending occurs.Meanwhile, since the braiding point of the
mandrel is spaced away from the position at which the
axial lines of bobbins placed on the bobbin carriers
and the axial line of the mandrel intersect with each 
other, the size of the braiaer is increased as much,
resulting in such a problem as deterioration of the
operability of the braider or increase of the installation
area.Further, where the tracks have a cylindrical
shape, the range of movement of the mandrel is limited,
and consequently, there is such a problem that the types
of braids which can be braided are limited.A braider showing the combination of features according to the preamble of independent claim 1 is described in WO-A-9 110 766.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an automated braider which is superior in
productivity or operability solving such objects of
the conventional braiders as described above.In order to attain the object described above,
according to the present invention, a mandrel is disposed
inside of a cylindrical or curved surface
configuration comprising tracks along which bobbin carriers are travelled,
and comprises a mandrel support member which is pivotable around
a braiding point and is linearly movable toward and away
from the braiding point. Further features of the invention form the subject-madder defined by claim 1.Further, according to a preferred embodiment it is proposed a braider in which
a braiding point of the mandrel is a position at

<CLAIMS>
Braider having a mandrel (m; 5) surrounded by a cylindrical or curved surface
configuration (U; 9) having tracks along which bobbin carriers (C; C'; 10) are travelled,

and a mandrel apparatus (Bm; 3) having a mandrel support member (b26; 18) which
is linearly

movable toward and away from the braiding point (P; 14) wherein said mandrel
apparatus (Bm; 3) is disposed on one side of a braider body (Bb; 2) and has a

horizontally movable frame (bl; 16) mounted for horizontal movement toward the
braiding point (P; 14), characterised in that a frame (b8) is mounted on said horizontally movable frame (b1 ;

16), and said mandrel support member (b26; 18) is movable along said frame (b8) and pivotable around a braiding point (P; 14) on said mandrel (m; 5)
such that a path of movement of said mandrel support member (b26; 18) on said

frame (b8) can be formed from an arc centered at the braiding point (P; 14).
Braider as claimed in claim 1, wherein a plurality of mandrel apparatus (Bm;
Bm') are surrounded by a cylindrical or curved surface configuration along

which said bobbin carriers (C;C';10) are travelled.
Braider as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein an actuator (b36) is disposed

further on said mandrel support member (b26; 18) and said mandrel (m; 5) is
mounted on an output shaft (b36') of said actuator to control the posture of said

mandrel (m; 5) three-dimensionally.
Braider as claimed in claim 1, wherein the braiding point (P; 14) of said
mandrel (m; 5) is in a position at which axial lines of bobbins placed on said bobbin

carriers (C; C'; 10) and an axial line of said mandrel (m; 5) on which braiding is
performed instersect with each other, and a braiding position stabilizing guide (G; 19)

is disposed in the proximity of the braiding point (P; 14) of said mandrel (m; 5). 
Braider as claimed in claim 4, wherein said braiding position stabilizing guide
(G; 19) includes a first braiding position stabilizing guide member (g1) and a second

braiding position stabilizing guide member (g2) disposed in a predetermined spaced
relationship across the braiding point (P; 14)..
Braider as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 5, wherein a dust collecting
apparatus (21, 22) has at least one fan (21) for sucking dust and at least one filter (22)

for catching the dust.
Braider as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 5 wherein a cutting apparatus (S;
20) is provided for cutting a braid for which braiding is completed and yarns (Y, y; 6)

connecting to the braid to separate them from each other.
