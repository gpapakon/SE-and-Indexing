<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a process for producing a component (1) from a preform, wherein the component has at least one two-piece bearing seat formed by a bearing cap (18), in which process the bearing cap (18) is separated from the preform. Before or after the bearing cap (18) is separated, a bearing layer (15) made from another material than that of the preform is applied to the bearing face (4) of the preform and at least the bearing layer (15) is divided by means of fracture separation.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a component from a 
shaped part, the component having at least one divided 

bearing seat (4) formed by a bearing cap (18), in which 
method the bearing cap is separated from the shaped 

part, characterised in that a bearing layer (15) made 

of a material other than that of the shaped part is 
applied to a bearing seat surface (4) of the shaped 

part, and that at least the bearing layer (15) is 
separated by fracture separation. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that before the coating of the shaped part the bearing 

cap (18) is separated from the shaped part and is 
assembled detachably therewith. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the separation of the bearing cap (18) is 

effected by fracture separation. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing cap (18) after the coating of the 

shaped part together with the part (21) of the bearing 
layer (15) applied to the seat surface (20) of the 

bearing cap is separated from the shaped part by 
fracture separation. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the shaped part is provided on 

the bearing seat surface (4) in the region of the point 
of separation (19) with at least one initial crack 

notch (17). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that before the fracture separation  

 
the shaped part is embrittled at least in the region of 

the point of separation (19) by selective heat 
treatment. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that before the fracture separation 

the shaped part is cooled at least in the region of the 
point of separation (19). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that before the fracture separation 

the bearing layer (15) is embrittled at least in the 
region of the point of separation (23) by selective 

heat treatment. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that before the fracture separation 

the bearing layer (15) is cooled at least in the region 
of the point of separation (23). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the cutting finishing of the 

bearing surface (13) of the bearing layer (15) after 
the separation of the bearing cap (18) and the fracture 

separation of the bearing layer (15) is effected in the 
assembled state of the component. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the bearing layer (15) is applied 

to the bearing seat surface (4) by a thermal spraying 
operation, in particular by flame spraying, high-speed 

flame spraying or plasma spraying. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the shaped part is produced by 

casting or forging or powder-metallurgical processes, 
in particular sintering or sinter-forging.  

 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the bearing layer (15) is formed 

as a sliding bearing layer. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that a connecting-rod (1) having a 

divided connecting-rod head (3) is produced as the 
component. 
A component which is made from a shaped part, 
comprising a basic body and a divided bearing seat 

formed by a bearing cap (18), characterised in that the 
bearing seat surface (4) of the basic body is provided 

with a bearing layer (15) made of a material other than 
that of the shaped part, and that the point of 

separation of the divided bearing seat at least in the 
region of the bearing layer (15) has a point of 

separation (23) produced by fracture separation. 
A component according to Claim 15, characterised 
in that the point of separation of the divided bearing 

seat also has a point of separation (19) produced by 
fracture separation in the region of the parting plane 

between the bearing cap (18) and the basic body. 
A component according to Claim 15 or 16, 
characterised in that the component is designed as a 

connecting-rod (1) having a divided connecting-rod head 
(3).
