<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide an 
electric drive system which ensures effective generation of 

torque from the start to the maximum speed, and extended 
cruising distance and upgraded running performances. The 

drive system according to the present invention is 
characterized in that, in an electric vehicle to be driven by 

the wheels which are driven by the rotary output of two or 
more motors (5,6), said two or more motors (5,6) comprise at least two 

different types of motors, and the system is provided with the 
control means (10) to adjust the share of the vehicle driving force 

to be generated by each of said motors in conformity to the 
running state of said vehicle. These two or more motors (5,6) 

comprise a combination of a low speed drive motor (5) and high 
speed drive motor (6), and a highly efficient motor is used as 

said low speed motor (5), while a motor having a greater capacity 
and greater base speed than said low speed drive motor (5) is used 

as the high speed drive motor (6). The share of the driving force 
of said vehicle is controlled by the control means such that 

up to the maximum torque is generated by said low speed drive 
motor (5), with the remaining torque generated by said high speed 

drive motor (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric vehicle
having an electric vehicle
drive system, according to the preamble of claim 1.As disclosed in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open NO. 133005-1990, the conventional
electric vehicle drive system is known to be available in the
following types;
a system wherein either the front or rear wheels are
driven by two or more motors, a system where each of the front
and rear is provided with one motor to form a four-wheel
drive, and a system where each of the wheels is driven. Each
of them is a drive system comprising a combination of one or
more motors of the same type or the same capacity where two
or more motors are controlled to produce the same output at
all times.In said technique, the drive efficiency depends on the
characteristics of each motor used even when two or more
motors are used. For example, when the motor featuring an
excellent torque generating efficiency is used in the low
speed range, efficient drive capacity cannot be gained in the
high speed range even when two or more motors are combined.
Conversely, efficiency in the low speed range is reduced by 
using the motor featuring an excellent torque generating efficiency in the
high speed range. This means that drive performances cannot be upgraded
over all speed ranges.Furthermore, the drive system composed of two or more motors of the
same type, increases the motor space and curb weight than the drive system
using only one motor; this is not advantageous for design configuration of
the electric vehicle.When the drive system is composed of two or more motors so that
power is supplied from the battery of the same system, it will be damaged
by short-circuiting if any power device of the power converter in said
system is damaged. This will cause a short circuit to be formed in the
power converter, and short circuit current to flow. So the brake torque is
produced until the faulty power device is burnt or the fuse in the circuit is
blown and opened.EP-A-0 496 059 relates to a method and device for transmission
control in electrical feed vehicles including at least one electrical motor and
a driving wheel whose respective shafts are mechanically linked together by
a coupling device, whereby the coupling device is adjustable according to
torque transmission. If the vehicle is equipped with two or more driving
wheels, each driving wheel is provided with its own propulsion system as
described above. The object of the present invention is to provide an
electric vehicle drive
