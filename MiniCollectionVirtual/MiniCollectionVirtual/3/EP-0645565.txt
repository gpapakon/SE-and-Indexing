<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shut-off valve, in particular a ball cock, with a housing and a connection stub, the mutually contacting linings of the flange faces being fitted with at least one sealing ring projecting towards the opposite flange face. When the connection stub and the housing are connected, this ring engages in receiving grooves in the opposite flange face.

<CLAIMS>
A shut-off device, especially a ball valve, 
comprising a control element (2) arranged in a housing (1), 

the housing (1) being provided with a flange face (8) which 
may be attached to a flange face (9) of a connecting branch 

(5), the inside and flange face (9) of which, as well as the 
inside and flange face (8) of the housing (1) are provided 

with a lining of plastics material or the like, the linings 
lying sealingly against each other when the connecting branch 

(5) is attached to the housing (1) and the mutually adjacent 
linings (110 and 510) of the flange faces (8 and 9) each 

being provided with at least one sealing ring (111 and 511 
respectively) projecting towards the opposing flange face and 

being formed of the material of the lining (110, 510), 
characterised in that the sealing rings engage in receiving 

grooves (112, 512) formed in the linings (110 and 510 
respectively) of the opposing flange faces (8 and 9) when the 

connecting branch (5) and the housing (1) are in the closed 
state, each sealing ring (111 and 511) being of uniform 

thickness while the free cross section of each receiving 
groove (512 and/or 112) tapers towards the deepest point of 

the groove. 
A shut-off device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the sealing rings (511 and 111) are longer than the 

thickness of the lining in the remaining area of the flange 
faces (8, 9). 
A shut-off device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the linings of each flange face (8, 9) 

comprise a plurality of sealing rings (511a, 511b; 111a, 
111b).  

 
A shut-off device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that one of the two 

linings (510 and 110 respectively) of the flange faces (8 or 
9) is constructed as a grooved seal (14). 
A shut-off device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the thickness of a 

sealing ring (511, 111) corresponds to the largest free cross 
section of the associated receiving groove (512, 112).
