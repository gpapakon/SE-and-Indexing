<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with polymer compositions that
are reinforced with inorganic filler and used
in the fabrication of flexible magnetic recording media. More
particularly, the compositions of the present invention provide tough,
cohesive, high modulus coatings. According to the present invention, a
polymer component containing a glassy resin and a rubbery polymer is
employed wherein the glassy resin is in contact with and encapsulates the
inorganic filler.Various types of bonding materials are useful in the fabrication of
filled synthetic polymer compositions. Certain of these synthetic
polymer compositions have been used for fabricating flexible magnetic
recording media. Another application of importance, especially from a
commercial point of view, involves fabricating abrasive articles. In
both of these areas of use, the interactions between the inorganic filler
and binder can effect critical characteristics of the final composition,
and therefore, its applicability for practical use. This is especially
important since in both magnetic recording media applications and
abrasive articles, high filler loading is employed which makes it
necessary to have strong interactions between the filler particles and
binder.In addition, high density recording requires tape coatings to be
fabricated with increasingly smaller magnetic particles. However,
current binder systems do not adequately address the need for optimized
binder-filler interaction and coating mechanical requirements. In fact,
current binder systems produce excessive debris and contamination of the
recording interface. For instance, it has been particularly difficult to
achieve useful reinforcement of conventional binders when filled with
stabilized iron metal particles, or of aluminum oxide (alumina)
particles, typically included along with iron metal or other non-abrasive
particulate media, as head cleaning agents. In addition, due to the lack
of significant chemical interaction with the oxide protective layer on
these particles, the results appear to indicate considerable sensitivity
to not only the source and type of particle, but also variations from
within the same lot of material in the case of iron metal powders.In fact, as compared to chromium dioxide particles, the interaction 
of iron and similar particles with various binders is significantly less.
For example, polyurethanes, which are quite suitable when used with
chromium dioxide particles, are not acceptable when used as the binder
for iron and iron oxide
