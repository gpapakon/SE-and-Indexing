<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for forming a coating
film on a substrate as known from US 5,066,616 and EP 0
403 086 A2 as well as an apparatus for carrying out such a
method. In the aforementioned two documents a wafer starts
rotation after a solvent has been applied thereto at the
center portion of the wafer. Thus, the wafer experiences a
material evaporation that the solvent with the subsequent
strong possibility at the solvent film portion which is
formed in the center portion of the wafer may differ in
thickness from the solvent film portion on the edge or
periphery of the wafer. This difference in uniformity has
a material impact upon the eventual uniformity of a layer
of photoresist which is applied to the wafer surface.
Furthermore, both aforementioned documents do not have any
disclosure whatsoever that a specific setting or
optimizing of the rotation speed is desired in order to
achieve a high accuracy and an even surface.US 4,451,507 discloses an automatic liquid dispensing
apparatus for spinning surface of uniform thickness. Here
a single nozzle is used for dispensing liquid.US 5,002,008 discloses a coating apparatus and method for
applying a liquid to a semiconductor wafer wherein a
nozzle is selected in a stand-by state. Here, one or two
nozzles are used for dispensing a resist solution.As is well known, in the field of semiconductor
techniques, a resist film is formed on the surface of a
layer as a mask for a pattern portion when a semiconductor
layer, an insulating layer, or an electrode layer
formed on a semiconductor wafer is to be etched into a
predetermined pattern.For example, spin coating is known as a method of
forming a resist film. According to this method, a
table is rotated with a semiconductor wafer being placed
and fixed thereon. For example, a resist solution
consisting of a solvent and a photo-sensitive resin is
dropped on the central portion of the upper surface of
the wafer. The resist solution is spirally diffused
from the central position of the wafer to its peripheral
portion in accordance with the rotational and centrifugal
forces of the wafer, thereby coating the resist
solution on the semiconductor wafer.According to this method, in the process of diffusing
the resist solution from the central position
of the wafer to its peripheral portion, the solvent in
the resist solution evaporates. For this reason, the
viscosity of the resist solution varies in a diffusion  
direction, and the thickness of the resist film at the
central portion is different from that at
