<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR MAKING CROSS-LINKED ETHYLENIC POLYMER FOAM STRUCTURES5 This invention relates to a composition of and a process for manufacturing a cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structure having enhanced processabi ty and physical propertiesCommercially-available, cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structures (XLPE) are typically made with conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) resins made by high pressure jø processes LDPE resins have found favor because of their relatively low melt temperatures and desirable processabihtyIt would be desirable to have an XLPE foam structure with enhanced strength and resiliency, yet retain the low foam density and desirable resin processabihty afforded by the use of LDPE resins One means of enhancing strength and resiliency is to employ a conventional- 5 linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), a copolymer of ethylene and a C 10 alpha-olef in Unfortunately, LLDPE resin is difficult to process and to a XLPE foam, and results in a relatively high density foam structure with poor quality It would be desirable to have an XLPE foam structure similar in strength and resiliency to an XLPE foam structure of LLDPE while comprising a resin having in an un-crosshnked state processabihty similar to an LDPE resin20 According to the present invention, there is a cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structure of an ethylenic polymer material of a cross-linked, substantially linear ethylenic polymer The substantially linear ethylenic polymer has in an un-crosshnked state a- a) a melt flow ratio, I10 I2. ≥ 5 63; b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation Mw/Mn < (l ιo/l2) - 4 63; and c) a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least25 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a linear ethylenic polymer having about the same l2 and Mw/Mn The foam structure is strong, resilient, and of low density The structure has high strength and resiliency similar to that of a foam structure comprised of cross-linked LLDPE, and has low density and quality similar to that of a foam structure of cross-linked LDPE30 Further according to the present invention, there is a process for making a cross- linked ethylenic polymer foam structure First, a foamable melt polymer material is formed by blending and heating a decomposable chemical blowing agent and an ethylenic polymer material comprising a substantially ethylenic polymer having, a) a melt flow ratio, o^'2. — 5 63, b) a molecular weight distribution,
