<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed for limiting the DC peak current value and/or the AC inrush current after the ignition of a discharge lamp (HL, NL) connected to an AC supply source (U) to connect a further current-limiting circuit part (B) in series with the conventional inductor (D) serving for limiting the current. At the instant when the discharge lamp is ignited this circuit part is in a first state in which it limits to a larger extent the current flowing through and switches over to a second state after a specific time has expired, in which state it limits to a lesser extent the current flowing through. The switching-over process can be carried out by a temperature-sensitive switch (S), which is in thermal contact with a component which is heated up by the current flowing through, or by a control circuit (ST).

Circuitry arrangement for limiting the d.c. current
peak value and/or the startup a.c. current upon

switching on of a gas discharge lamp (HL; NL) which
can be connected to an a.c. current supply source (U),

having a choke (L) serving for current limiting and a
further current limiting circuit part (B) connected in

series with the choke (L),

characterised in that,

upon the switching on, the further current limiting
circuit part (B) in a first state allows a more

strongly limited current to pass and after expiry of
a certain time switches into a second state in which

it allow a less strongly limited current to pass.
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that,

the further current limiting circuit part (B) includes
an upstream resistance (RV).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 2,

characterised in that,

there is arranged parallel to the upstream resistance
(RV) a switching device (S) which is open in the first

state of the current limiting circuit part (B) and is
closed in the second state.
Circuitry arrangement according to any preceding
claim,

characterised in that,

the switching arrangement (S) is temperature
sensitive.
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 4,

characterised in that,

the temperature sensitive switching arrangement (S) is 
a bimetallic switch.
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 4 or 5,

characterised in that,

the upstream resistance (RV) is a heater resistance
which, due to its heat development, closes the

initially open switching arrangement (S).
Circuitry arrangement according to any of claims 4 to
6,

characterised in that,

the choke (L) is so thermally coupled with the
switching arrangement (S) that the choke (L), due to

its heat development, closes and/or holds in the
closed condition the initially open switching

arrangement (S).
Circuitry arrangement according to any of claims 4 to
7,

characterised in that,

an additional heating arrangement is provided which,
due to its heat development, closes and/or holds

closed the initially open switching arrangement (S).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 8,

characterised in that,

the additional heating arrangement includes a heating
resistance (RH).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 9,

characterised in that,

the additional heating resistance (RH) is connected
parallel to the choke (L).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 9,

characterised in that,

the additional heating resistance (RH) is connected 
parallel to the series circuit of the upstream

resistance (RV) and the choke (L).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 3,

characterised in that,

a control arrangement (ST) is provided for controlling
the switching arrangement (S).
Circuitry arrangement according to claim 12,

characterised in that,

the control arrangement (ST) closes the initially open
switching arrangement (S) after expiry of a certain

time.
