<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical preparation containing a number of coated particles
comprising a salt of morphine coated with a barrier membrane with a controlled release of morphine over the main part
of the dose interval when administered once daily, providing a significantly reduced plasma concentration fluctuation
compared to known morphine preparations. The invention is also related to a method for the manufacture of such a
preparation and the use of such preparations for the manufacture of an analgesic useful in the treatment of severe
chronical pain.Morphine has a serum half-life of 2-4 hours and the duration of its analgesic effect is about 4-6 hours after oral
administration.
The short duration makes it necessary to administer morphine orally 4-6 times daily to achieve a satisfactory analgesic
effect.
This has led to a development of various oral controlled release formulations of morphine.
Oral controlled release products containing morphine on the market e.g. MST Continus® or MS Contin® and Dolcontin®,
are in general administered 2-3 times a day in order to give a sufficient pain relief over the entire dosage interval.
Conventional matrix tablets consisting of morphine and an inert carrier composition are characterized by a fast initial
drug release leading to an early peak of morphine plasma concentration followed by a decrease in release, which will
be especially pronounced in the lower intestinal system where more neutral or weakly basic conditions prevail.
There has been a demand to find a way to obtain an oral drug preparation having a more even release of morphine in
order to get smoother blood concentration and effect profiles over the entire dosage interval when administered once
daily.EP-B-0 097 523 discloses such a preparation where the drug is distributed in a controlled release matrix partly
in the form of a salt and partly as a free base. This preparation increases dissolution time and biovailabilty without the
need of applied coating membranes.It is known that morphine gives considerable problems in the development of matrix tablets which have been
considered to be due to poor absorption properties of morphine in the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract, see Proceed.
Intern. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater., 18, 1991, pag. 433-434, (B. Olsson et al).There are several examples of formulations which are designed to overcome the drawbacks of oral matrix tablets
by providing a constant or controlled release rate over a more extended period.
An example

<CLAIMS>
An oral pharmaceutical preparation containing a therapeutically effective amount
of a salt of morphine for administration once daily 
characterized in that
 it consists of
at least 50 individual particles with an individual particle size in the range of 0.7 to 1.4

mm, each particle having a core containing a salt of morphine coated with a barrier
layer said barrier layer being derived from a solution, dispersion, suspension, emulsion

or melt, and containing at least one water insoluble component selected from the
group consisting of ethyl cellulose, copolymers synthesised from acrylic and

methacrylic esters and natural or synthetic waxes, and a plasticizer, for providing drug

release through the coating barrier layer which is substantially independent of pH in
the range of 1.0 to 7.0 and 
in that
 the mean serum concentration of morphine
obtained is at least 50% of the maximum serum concentration during at least 12 hours

after the administration of a single dose of said preparation.
A preparation according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the mean serum
concentration of morphine obtained is at least 50% of the maximum serum

concentration during at least 18 hours after the administration of a single dose of said
preparation.
A preparation according to any previous claim 
characterized in that
 the coating
barrier layer also contains at least one water soluble component selected from the

group consisting of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, copolymers
synthesised from acrylic and methacrylic acid esters, and optionally pigments.
A preparation according to any previous claim 
characterized in that
 the coating
barrier layer contains ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and triethyl

citrate as a plasticizer.

characterized in that
 the viscosity
of the ethyl cellulose lies in the range of from 5 to 15 cps.
A preparation according to any previous claim 
characterized in that
 the salt of
morphine is chosen among morphine hydrochloride, morphine sulphate and morphine

salts of organic carboxylic acids.
A preparation according to any previous claim 
characterized in that
 it is in the
form of a tablet, a capsule or a sachet.
A process for the manufacture of the preparation according to any of claims 1-8

characterized in that

procedure in a fluidized bed with a coating liquid in the form of a solution containing

at least one water insoluble barrier layer forming component, a plasticizer and
one or several solvents selected from the group consisting of ethanol, acetone, and

methyl isobutylketone (MIBK), for providing a pH-independent barrier coating on the

A process for the manufacture of the preparation according to any of claims 1-8

characterized in that
 the morphine containing particles are subjected to a spray
coating procedure in a fluidized bed with a coating liquid in the form of a dispersion,

suspension or emulsion containing at least one water insoluble barrier layer forming
component, a plasticizer and one or several solvents selected from the group consisting
