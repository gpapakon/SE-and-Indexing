<ABSTRACT>
A technique for removing particles from above a semiconductor 
wafer, particularly particles that are trapped in a plasma 

chamber during processing of the wafer (22). Trapped particles 
are usually not all drawn out with gases exhausted from the 

chamber, in part because a peripheral focus ring and clamping 
mechanism impede their flow. In the method of the invention, 

the focus ring (28) and clamping mechanism (24) are raised on 
completion of processing, but before radio-frequency (rf) power 

is disconnected from the process chamber. Trapped particles are 
then easily flowed from the chamber with an introduced inert 

gas, and the level of particulate contamination of the wafer is 
significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to techniques for removal of 
particulate contaminants during semiconductor processing and, more particularly, 
to methods for removing contaminant particles that may accumulate in a 
reaction chamber particularly a plasma reactor chamber. In the manufacture of microelectronic devices, particulate contamination 
has become of increasing concern because semiconductor devices are being packed with 
ever-increasing densities on semiconductor chips. Usually, multiple chips are formed 
from a single larger semiconductor wafer, six to eight inches (15-20 cm) in diameter, 
but overall chip dimensions have been increasing in recent years and some integrated 
circuits may occupy areas comparable with a whole wafer. Concurrently, there has been 
a continuing trend toward smaller device geometries, i.e. higher device densities. 
Obviously, use of a smaller device geometry means that smaller contaminant particles 
may cause defects in a circuit. The presence of particles during deposition or etching of 
thin films can cause voids, dislocations or short-circuits, which adversely affect 
performance and reliability of the devices. Moreover, larger overall device dimensions 
result in a lower percentage yield of satisfactory devices. Particle contamination has been significantly reduced by improving the 
quality of clean rooms and automated equipment designed to handle semiconductor 
wafers, and by improving techniques to clean the wafer surfaces. However, many 
particles are generated inside wafer processing chambers themselves. Possible sources 
of contamination include processing materials, interior walls of processing chambers, and 
mechanical wear of the automated wafer handling equipment. More specifically, in 
processing steps that use a plasma many chemical "fragments" of various kinds are 
generated from the processing gases, including ions, electrons and radicals. The 
fragments can combine to form generally slightly negatively charged particles, which 
may ultimately contaminate a wafer being processed. In addition, various materials, such  
 
as polymers, are coated onto the process chamber walls during plasma processing. 
Mechanical and thermal stresses may cause these materials to fracture and dislodge from 
the walls, generating additional contaminant particles. Other sources of contaminants are 
oil from vacuum pumps, and particles generated within the processing chambers during 
wafer transfer operations. In plasma processing, contaminant particles typically become

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing unwanted contaminant particles from 
a processing chamber, in which a semiconductor wafer is 

held in position by a peripheral mechanism, the method 
comprising the steps of: 


continuously evacuating the chamber; 
terminating a flow of cooling gas to the wafer; 
raising the peripheral mechanism above the wafer; 
supplying gas to the chamber; and 
continuing to evacuate the chamber, wherein particles 
above the wafer can flow freely beneath the 

peripheral mechanism and out of the chamber. 
A method as defined in Claim 1, wherein the step of 
supplying gas to the chamber includes switching to a 

source of inert gas prior to raising the peripheral 
mechanism. 
A method for removing unwanted contaminant particles from 
a plasma processing chamber especially according to Claim 

1 or 2 the method comprising the steps of: 

placing a semiconductor wafer on a support in the 
processing chamber; 
lowering a clamping mechanism onto the wafer, the 
clamping mechanism including a focus ring extending 

above the wafer at its periphery, to enhance 
uniformity of processing; 
introducing process gases into the chamber; 
applying radio-frequency (rf) power to chamber 
electrodes, to sustain a plasma region that enhances 

processing of the wafer; 
continuously evacuating the chamber through an 
exhaust port, to maintain a desired pressure in the 

chamber during processing; and 
on completion of processing, but before disconnecting 
rf power from the chamber electrodes, terminating 

flow of any cooling gas supplied to the wafer and 
raising the clamping mechanism and focus ring from 

the wafer, wherein particles trapped above the wafer 
during processing may flow out beneath the clamping 

mechanism and focus ring, and through the exhaust 
port. 
A method as defined in claim 3, and further comprising 
the step switching from a supply of process gases to a 

supply of inert gas prior to lifting the clamping 
mechanism. 
A method as defined in Claim 4, and further comprising 
the step of increasing the flow rate of inert gas. 
A method as defined in Claim 5, and further comprising 
the step of maintaining the increased flow rate for a 

period of at least a few seconds, to sweep the particles 
into the exhaust port.
