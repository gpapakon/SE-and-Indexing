<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speech
enhancement apparatus for enhancing rising portions of
speech including consonants.Figure 15 shows a basic configuration of a
conventional speech enhancement apparatus. The speech
enhancement apparatus includes an amplifier 101 for
amplifying a speech signal, a gap detector 102 for
detecting a silence component, an envelope follower 103
for following an envelope of the speech signal, a zero
crossing detector 104 for determining the zero crossing
frequency of the speech signal, and a differentiator
105 for determining the rate of change in the
speech signal. The speech enhancement apparatus further
includes a one-shot mono/multivibrator 106 which
generates a pulse on the basis of the output from the
gap detector 102, the differentiator 105, and the
zero crossing detector 104 so as to control the amplifier
101.The operation of such a conventional speech
enhancement apparatus will be described with reference
to Figures 16A to 16C. Figure 16A shows a waveform of
an input speech signal. The input speech signal is
sent to the amplifier 101, the gap detector 102, the
envelope follower 103, and the zero crossing
detector 104. The gap detector 102 detects a silence
component of the received speech signal and outputs the
result to the one-shot mono/multivibrator 106. The 
envelope follower 103 follows an envelope of the received
speech signal and outputs the result to the
differentiator 105. The differentiator 105 determines
the rate of change in the envelope and outputs the
result to the one-shot mono/multivibrator 106. The
zero crossing detector 104 determines the zero crossing
frequency of the received speech signal and outputs the
result to the one-shot mono/multivibrator 106. Based
on the outputs from the gap detector 102, the differentiator
105, and the zero crossing detector 104, the
one-shot mono/multi vibrator 106 generates a pulse
having a waveform as shown in Figure 16B. The pulse is
generated when a silence component of the speech signal
shifts to a sound component thereof and lasts until
both the zero crossing frequency and the rate of change
in the envelope become sufficiently high. The pulse
generated by the one-shot mono/multivibrator 106 is
sent to the amplifier 101. On receipt of the pulse,
the amplifier 101 amplifies the input speech signal
with a predetermined amount of gain, and outputs an
amplified speech signal having a waveform as shown
in Figure 16C. When no pulse is sent to the
amplifier 101, the original speech signal input to the
amplifier 101
