<ABSTRACT>
A friction enhancing material (28) is applied to at least one 
surface (23,24) of the geosynthetic clay liner (20). The placement of 

friction enhancing material (28) on the surface (23,24) of the liner 
(20) that 

engages a slope or embankment (11,12,13) of a landfill helps the liner 
(20) maintain its position during and after installation. The 

improved frictional contact between the liner (20) and the slope or 
embankment (11,12,13) permits use of bentonite liners on steeper slopes 

or 
embankments and therefore enables more efficient construction of 

landfills. The friction enhancement material (28) may also be applied 
to the surface (23,24) to improve contact between the upper surface of 

the geosynthetic clay liner (20) and the cover soil. The friction 
enhancement material (28) may be high density polyethylene, EVA, 

rubbers and other polymeric materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an improved geosynthetic 
clay liner for use on relatively steep slopes or embankments. 
Specifically, the invention relates to an improved geosynthetic 
clay liner with a lower surface that has been at least partially 
coated with a friction enhancing material. The friction 
enhancing material improves the frictional contact between 
the lower surface of the liner and the slope or embankment that 
comes in contact with the lower surface of the liner. The concept of using geosynthetic clay liners made with 
bentonite for lining landfill sites is well-known. The problem 
addressed by the present invention involves the prevention of 
the geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) from sliding down the slope 
or embankment surrounding the periphery of the landfill. The 
present invention may also be used in the construction of man-made 
lakes and ponds. A GCL is commonly comprised of three major parts: (1) the 
primary carrier sheet, also known as the primary backing, primary 
textile or primary carrier; (2) a cover sheet, also known as the 
secondary textile, secondary carrier sheet or scrim; and (3) a 
layer of bentonite disposed therebetween. Geosynthetic clay liners in current use are normally sewn 
or needle punched together to enhance the internal sheer strength 
of the liner and improve the performance of the liners when they 
are used on sloped surfaces. However, enhancing the internal 
sheer strength of the liners does not address the problem of the 
liners sliding down a slope or embankment during or after  
 
installation. If the liner is installed during wet conditions, 
this slippage problem is even more prevalent. Simply put, no 
geosynthetic clay liner found in the prior art provides an 
increased coefficient of friction between the underside of the 
liner and the surface in direct contact with the underside of 
the liner. The inability of geosynthetic clay liners to maintain their 
position on steep slopes can also stem from the granular 
bentonite contained within the liner. Bentonite is a clay 
material that expands and becomes substantially impermeable upon 
being exposed to water. The layer of bentonite contained with 
the liners creates a low permeability barrier at the bottom of 
landfills. However, wet bentonite is extremely slippery. If any 
bentonite migrates through the lower sheet of the liner, the 
slippery bentonite will contribute to the inability of 
geosynthetic clay liner to maintain its positions on steep slopes 
and embankments. If the liner is made
