<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a pliers-like combination tool (1) having two handle parts (2), a joint (3) and also two working parts (10,20) constructed as jaws (11,21) of pliers, in which a hammer head (25) is integrally formed on a first jaw (11) and a hammer point (15) is integrally formed on the second jaw (21), the hammer head (25) and the hammer point (15) being coaxially aligned and running substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the tool, the invention proposes that the two working parts (10,20) are constructed with a crescent-shaped curve as jaws (11,21) of a plaster cutter.

<CLAIMS>
Plier-like combination tool (1) having two grip 
parts (2), an articulation (3), and two active parts (10, 

20) which are designed as plier jaws, a hammer head (25) 
being integrally formed on a first jaw (21) and a hammer 

tip (15) being integrally formed on the second jaw (11), 
the hammer head and the hammer tip being aligned equiaxially 

and running essentially perpendicularly with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the tool, characterized 

in that the two active parts (10, 20) are designed 
to be curved in a sickle-like manner as jaws (11, 21) of 

plaster shears. 
Combination tool according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a narrow front edge (16) is integrally 

formed in a step-like manner on the hammer tip (15). 
Combination tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that depressions (12, 22) are arranged 

in the cutting edges (14, 24) of the plaster shears and 
run essentially perpendicularly with respect to the 

cutting edge (14, 24). 
Combination tool according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the cutting edges (14, 24) are designed in 

a toothed manner by means of the depressions (12, 22). 
Combination tool according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a spring is arranged 

between the two grip parts (2) and spreads apart the two 
grip parts (2), the spring being arranged between articulation 

(3) and the grip region of the grip parts (2). 
Combination tool according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a catch hook is 

arranged pivotably, between the grip region and the  
 

articulation (3), on one of the grip parts (2) and is 
assigned a protrusion on the other grip part (2) in order 

to keep the tool (1) in the closed state. 
Combination tool according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that a latching means is assigned to the catch 

hook, on the grip part (2) on which the latter is pivotably 
mounted, in order to secure the catch hook in its 

position in which it releases the other grip part (2).
