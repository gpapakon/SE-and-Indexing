 LATH FOR P ASTER AND THE LIKETECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to the general field of building construction products, and more particularly relates to a lath for use in mounting plaster and the like to a substrate.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn the application of plaster and the like to a vertical substrate, it is common in the art to place a metal lath against the substrate prior to applying any plaster. The lath is secured to the substrate, as by nailing, and acts to help stabilize the plaster while it is in its flowable state prior to drying and tends to reinforce the plaster.Fig. 1 shows a typical prior art metal lath which is essentially a screen made up of individual undulating strands secured to each other in a heel-to-toe arrangement similar to overlapping shingles. One disadvantage of such a known metal lath is that, while the openings of the metal lath generally allow plaster to be passed therein to make direct contact with the underlying substrate, the lath generally remains in close contact with the underlying substrate and very little plaster becomes positioned between the lath structure and the underlying substrate. To ensure that at least a minimum amount of plaster is positioned between the metal lath and the substrate, it has been known in the art to first secure vertical furring strips of thin wood to the substrate prior to mounting the metal lath. This places the metal lath a selected small distance away from the substrate and ensures that plaster is forced between the metal lath and the substrate when the plaster is applied with a trowel. Of course, in many instances 

it would be desirable, if possible, to eliminate the need for first nailing furring strips to the substrate to prepare it for receiving a lath.Another problem presented by the use of known metal laths in plaster is that the plaster is essentially alkaline and tends to corrode or attack the metal lath. The resulting corrosion of the metal lath can leach through the plaster causing stains in the exterior of the plaster, can reduce the mechanical strength of the lath itself, and can reduce the mechanical bond between the lath and the surrounding plaster. Also, known metal laths, such as that shown in Fig. 1, typically have a directional bias, that is, they are more well-suited for receiving plaster when applied with a trowel moving in one direction than with a trowel moving in some other direction. Obviously, it would be preferred that a lath be equally well-suited to receiving plaster when applied with a

CLAIMS
1. A lath for use in mounting plaster and the like to a substrate, comprising: a substantially planar grid including first portions extending laterally in a first direction and second portions extending laterally and generally transversely of said first portions, said grid having a generally smooth side, and said first portions and said second portions defining a plurality of openings extending transversely through said grid, said lath further comprising a plurality of spacer means positioned opposite said generally smooth side of said grid for spacing said grid away from the substrate for allowing plaster tc be pressed between said grid and the substrate.
2. A lath as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said grid and said spacer means are made of a thermo-plastic material.
3. A lath as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said first portions comprise a first plurality of relatively flat strands and wherein said second portions and said spacer means comprise a second plurality of strands having a relatively flat portion and an upstanding portion attached to said relatively flat portion.
4. A lath as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said grid has a selected thickness and wherein said spacer means are sized and adapted to space said grid away from the substrate a distance generally at least as great as said selected thickness
5. A lath as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said spacer means are sized and adapted to space said grid- at least .050 inches away from the substrate. 


6. A lath for use in mounting plaster and the like trate, said lath comprising: a substantially planar grid made of a thermo-plastic material and including a plurality of first elongate, generally flat strands extending laterally in a first direction and a plurality of second elongate strands extending laterally and generally transversely of said first elongate strands, said grid having a generally smooth side, and wherein said first elongate strands and said second elongate strands define a plurality of openings extending transversely through said grid, said second elongate strands comprising spacer portions positioned generally opposite said smooth side of said grid for spacing said grid a selected distance away from the substrate.
