<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the formation of coordination 
compounds of titanium and more specifically to the preparation of TiCl₃-ether 
coordination compounds from TiCl₃·1/3AlCl₃. Coordination compounds of TiCl₃ such as TiCl₃ complexes with, 
dimethoxyethane (DME) or tetrahydrofuran (THF) are useful intermediates in forming 
metallocenes by the reaction of the complexes with cyclopentadienyl containing 
ligands. The metallocenes, when activated, catalyze olefin polymerization. It is known to prepare a TiCl₃(THF)₃ complex by refluxing anhydrous 
tetrahydrofuran with TiCl₃ as reported in Inorganic Synthesis, Vol. 21, 1982, p. 137. 
The coordination complex TiCl₃(DME)1.5 is prepared in an analogous manner as 
reported in J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 3748-3749. Pure TiCl₃ starting material can be 
obtained by hydrogen reduction of TiCl₄, which is costly. Aluminum reduction of 
TiCl₄ is less expensive but the product is the complex, TiCl₃·1/3AlCl₃ rather than 
pure TiCl₃. I have now discovered that TiCl₃·1/3AlCl₃ will react with ether solvents 
at ambient temperature to form solid TiCl₃ coordination complexes in good to high 
yields and purity. When using cyclical ethers, most, and in some cases virtually all, 
of the aluminum chloride by-product stays in solution. The process not only provides 
the advantage of starting with a more readily available and less expensive material 
compared to starting with pure TiCl₃, but the presence of the aluminum chloride may 
also be responsible for driving the spontaneous formation of the Ti(III) chloride 
coordination compounds at ambient temperatures such that reflux of the reaction 
mixture is not necessary. In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for 
preparing a TiCl₃ coordination complex comprising adding TiCl₃·1/3AlCl₃ to an ether 
solvent so as to form a solid, TiCl₃-ether coordination complex in said solvent.  The starting material TiCl₃·1/3 AlCl₃, is obtained by aluminum 
reduction of TiCl₄, as known in the art, and this material is commercially available in 
anhydrous form. Suitable ether solvents are cyclic ethers and acyclic polyethers having 
from about 4 to 10 carbon atoms. Cyclic ether solvents have the advantage of 
solvating the AlCl₃. Because the AlCl₃ remains in solution in the ether, a solid, 
substantially AlCl₃ free TiCl₃-ether coordination complex is produced. Non-limiting 
examples of ethers include tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether 
(DME or glyme), 1,4-dioxane, 2-methoxyethyl ether (diglyme),
