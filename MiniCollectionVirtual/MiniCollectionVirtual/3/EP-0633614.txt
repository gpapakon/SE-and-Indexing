<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a polymer 
based tunable light emitting diode (LED). Commercial LED devices are made of inorganic 
semiconductors e.g. GaAs, GaP, etc. which cover almost the 
whole spectral region. It would be advantageous to have an 
organic material with electroluminescence in the blue 
region, as organic materials are usually more easy to 
process. The production of an effective blue LED using 
organic materials has however not been accomplished yet, 
which is one of the reasons for the search for alternative 
materials. Although low molecular weight organic materials 
are known to give luminescence even with high 
efficiencies, only recently the use in electroluminescent 
devices was reported. A disadvantage of the use of low 
molecular weight organic materials in devices is their 
tendency to recrystallize. The use of organic materials in the production 
of LED has certain advantages, especially from the 
viewpoint of processability. One of the important advantages of the polymer 
LED is its ease of fabrication. The active polymer or 
prepolymer can be cast from solution on a substrate which 
makes it possible to fabricate large-area devices. 
Conjugated polymers can cover the whole spectral region by 
chemical tuning of the wavelength of the emission by 
choice of the polymer and control of the conjugation 
length of the polymer. Another promising feature is the 
additional use of a conducting polymer as the hole-injecting 
electrode resulting in a fully flexible LED. Suitable candidates for applications in stable 
optoelectronic devices are conjugated polymers. Polymers  
 
can be processed relatively easily and especially large 
area structures are feasible. The first encouraging 
results were reported by Burroughes ET AL (Nature, 347, 
477 (1992)), Braun ET AL. (Appl. Phys. Lett. 58, 
1982(1992)) and Grem ET AL. (Adv. Mater.4, 36 (1992)), 
using poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s and poly(p-phenylene) as 
the electroluminescent layer. The basic element giving rise to injection 
luminescence is that of a p-n junction diode operated 
under forward bias as is illustrated in fig. 1. The electrons recombine with holes and give rise 
to emitted photons. In the ideal case each injected 
electron takes part in the radiative recombination but in 
practice this is not the case. The quantum efficiency of a 
device made of an inorganic semiconductor emitting in the 
visible region lies in the range 0.05 to 4%. The 
wavelength of the emitted photon is determined by the 
energy band gap (ideal
