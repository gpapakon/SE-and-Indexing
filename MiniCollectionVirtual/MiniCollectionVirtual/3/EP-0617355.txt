<ABSTRACT>
The ventilation control (21) regulates the feed rate of a number of ventilation fans (20a...20d) in dependence on the number of modules (12a...12d) inserted in respective module locations (11a...11d). The ventilation control is supplied with module information representing the number and type of modules, the corresponding ventilation fan feed rates calculated using a given algorithm. Pref. the ventilation control is coupled to the modules for receiving the module information via a common bus system.

<CLAIMS>
Method for controlling the output of one or
more fans (20a..d) in an appliance having one or more

module compartments (11a..c) for the reception of
modules (12a..d), a fan control (21) determining module

information, which indicates the presence and therefore
the number or else the type of connected modules, via a

signal path connected to the appliance and setting the
output of the fans (20a..d) according to a

predetermined algorithm on the basis of the said module
information.
Method according to Claim 1, the fan control
(21) being connected to the modules (12a..c) via a

common bus system (10) or separate signal paths and
determining the module information via these.
Method according to Claim 1, the appliance
being a data-processing system with an operating

program which provides the module information and which
transmits it to the fan control (21) via a signal path.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, with
at least one sensor (23) for a supply-air temperature,

which is linked to the module information by the fan
control, the output of the fans (20a..d) being set

according to the result of the link.
Method according to Claim 4, a performance
figure being formed from the module information and

being multiplied by the supply-air temperature, and the
output being controlled in proportion to this. 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, if a
predefined supply-air temperature or else a predefined

rate of rise of the supply-air temperature is exceeded
the fan control (21) assuming a fault state and

preferably thereupon controlling all the fans
(20a..20d) at maximum output.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, the
fans (20a..d) transmitting rotational-speed information

to the fan control (21), and the latter, if the
rotational speed falls short of a predefined minimum

rotational speed or a minimum rotational speed derived
from the desired rotational speed, assuming a fault

state and preferably thereupon controlling all the fans
(20a..d) at maximum output.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, the
fans (20a..d) transmitting rotational-speed information

to a monitoring circuit (22), and the latter, if the
rotational speed falls short of a predefined minimum

rotational speed or a minimum rotational speed set by

the fan control (21), sending a signal (29), preferably
an interruption signal, to the fan control (21) which

thereupon assumes a fault state and preferably controls
all the fans (20a..d) at maximum output.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, the appliance having an operator panel (14),

and the fan control (21) indicating a fault state on
the said operator panel.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, an operator interface (13) determining the

module information via a signal path (10) to the
modules (12a..d) and transferring the said module

information to the fan control (21) via a second signal
path (27).
Method according to one of the preceding Claims
6 to 10, the fan control (21), when it assumes a fault

state, sending a signal to the operating program, in
particular in order to cause the operating program to

stop correctly. 
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, the fan control determining, via a further

signal path from the power supply supplying the
appliance with energy, a value for the power

consumption or power delivery and utilizing the said
value as an additional parameter in the calculation of

the necessary output.
Arrangement for controlling the output of one
or more fans (20a..d) in an appliance having one or

more module compartments (11a..d) for the reception of
modules (12a..d) and having a fan control (21) which is

connected, on the one hand, to the modules (12a..d) via
a signal path (10, 10a) for the transmission of module

information which indicates the presence and
consequently the number or else the type of connected

modules, and, on the other hand, to devices for setting
the output of the fans (20a..c) and which sets the

output of the fans (20a..d) according to a
predetermined algorithm on the basis of the said module

information.
Arrangement according to Claim 13, a console
interface (13) determining the module information via a

first signal path (10) and transferring it to the fan
control (21) via a second signal path (27).
Arrangement according to Claim 13 or 14, the
fans (20a..d) having an input for connecting a

temperature sensor, preferably a PTC resistor, which
receives electrical signals from the fan control (21).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 13 to
15, at least one sensor (22) for the supply-air

temperature being additionally connected to the fan
control (21).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 13 to
16, the fans (20a..d) having an output (25a..c) with

rotational-speed information, the said output being
connected to the fan control (21).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 13 to
16, the fans (20a..d) having an output (25a..c) with 

rotational-speed information, the said output being
connected to a monitoring circuit (22) for the

rotational-speed information, and the monitoring
circuit (22), in turn, being connected to the fan

control (21).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 13 to
18, a characteristic value for the power consumption or

power delivery of the power supply of the appliance
being fed to the fan control (21) via a signal path.
