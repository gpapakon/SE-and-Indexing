<ABSTRACT>
Accelerometer on a silicon substrate (1) on which a beam (2) made from polysilicon is bendably anchored as a motion detector, and on which a tip (3) is arranged which is directed towards said beam (2) and is provided for utilising the tunnel effect. Electrodes (4) are present which upon the application of a potential cause an electrostatic compensation of bending of the beam (2).

Acceleration sensor on a silicon substrate (1) on 
which an electrically conductively doped polysilicon bar 

(2) is flexurally anchored, and on which, under this bar 
(2), an electrically conductively doped polysilicon spike 

(3), directed towards the bar (2), is arranged at such a 
small distance from the bar (2) that the tunnelling 

effect is introduced between this spike (3) and the bar 
(2), electrodes (4) being provided for electrostatic 

compensation of the inertial force acting on the bar (2). 
Acceleration sensor according to Claim 1, in 
which the bar (2) is situated in a cavity enclosed by a 

polysilicon layer (5), and in which the electrodes (4) on 
the bar (2) and on this polysilicon layer (5) are 

designed in such a way as to be opposite one another. 
Process for producing an acceleration sensor 
according to Claim 1, 


in which, in a first step, a first polysilicon layer (6), 
followed by a second layer (7) of a different material, 

are applied to a silicon substrate (1) provided with 
structured doping, 
in which, in a second step, these two layers (6, 7) are 
structured in such a way that, 
in a third step, as a result of wet chemical undercut 
etching of the first layer (6), a spike (3) is left, 
in which, in a fourth step, an auxiliary layer (8) and a 
planarizing layer (9) are applied over the entire surface, 
in which, in a fifth step, a planar portion of this 
auxiliary layer (8) is bared and structured,  

 
in which, in a sixth step, a polysilicon layer is applied 
over the entire surface, doped for producing an electrode 

(4) and removed until an anchored bar (2) is left, and 
in which, in a seventh step, the auxiliary layer (8) is 
removed. 
Process according to Claim 3 for producing an 
acceleration sensor according to Claim 2, 


in which, before the seventh step, a further auxiliary 
layer (10) is applied over the entire surface and structured, 
then the polysilicon layer (5) is applied over the entire 
surface, doped for producing an electrode (4) and removed 

until a portion spanning the bar (2) is left, and 
in the seventh step, this further auxiliary layer (10) is 

likewise removed.
