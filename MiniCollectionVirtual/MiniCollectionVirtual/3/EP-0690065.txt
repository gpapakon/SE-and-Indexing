<ABSTRACT>
Novel biphenyl-2,2'-diyl-bis diphenyl- phosphines of formulae (I) and (II) with the biphenyl rings in (I) opt. substd. by up to 8 F and/or Cl are claimed, as are also (i) prepn. of (I) and (II) by reaction in an org. solvent of a biphenyl phosphine oxide of formula (III) (opt. having up to 6 additional F and/or Cl on the biphenyl rings) with either (i) Cl2SiMeH and NBu3 or (ii) a refluxing mixt. of HSiCl3 and NBu3; (ii) cpd. (III) as a novel cpd.; (iii) prepn. of (III) and its intermediates; (iv) Rh(I)-, Ru(II)-, Pd(II)- and PD(O)- complexes of (I) and (II) and their use as catalysts, esp. for addn., substitution, adducting or coupling reactions; and (v) prepn. of the complexes (iv). X = F or Cl.
