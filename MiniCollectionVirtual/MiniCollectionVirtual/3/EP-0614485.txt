<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S.
Application Serial No. 07/513,543, which was filed April 23, 1990 (US Patent
No. 5635387).The present invention relates generally to cells which make up bone
marrow, and more specifically, to methods which may be utilized to
selectively expand the number of CD34 positive cells.Cancer accounts for over one-fifth of the total mortality in the
United States, and is the second leading cause of death. The leading types of
cancer in men are lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, and for women, breast,
lung and colorectal cancer. Currently, most cancers are treated with a
combination of therapies involving surgery, and chemotherapy and/or radiation
therapy.One difficulty with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, however, is that
it also destroys an individual's immune system, as well as stem cells, the progenitor
cells of the immune system. In order to reconstitute the immune system, a patient
undergoes bone marrow transplantation with generally either allogenic or
autologous bone marrow. Many individuals, however, die because their own bone
marrow is involved with the cancer, or a histocompatible donor cannot be found.One method that has been suggested to overcome this difficulty is
the use of long-term marrow cultures which prolong the life of engrafting cells.
For example, Dexter et al. (J. Cell Phys. 91:335, 1976) describes conditions for
proliferating stem cells in vitro (hereinafter referred to as "Dexter cultures").
Briefly, this method involves the establishment of an adherent monolayer of
stromal cells, which supports the viability of stem and early progenitor cells.
Dexter cultures, however, are ultimately disadvantageous because they only slow
the death rate of stem and progenitor cells, and do not provide the desired result
of increasing the number of such cells. The present invention provides methods for selectively
expanding CD34+ cells. These methods overcome disadvantages of
prior methods, and further provide other related advantages.Briefly stated, the present invention is directed toward
methods for selectively expanding CD34+ cells.
Within one aspect of the present invention, a method for
selectively expanding CD34+ cells is provided, comprising the steps of (a) separating
stem cells from other cells, and (b)
incubating the separated CD34 positive
cells in a selected medium containing
stem cell growth factor, Mast
cell Growth Factor, Interleukin 1,
Interleukin 3, Interleukin 4, Interleukin 6,
Interleukin 7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF,
TGF-β,
