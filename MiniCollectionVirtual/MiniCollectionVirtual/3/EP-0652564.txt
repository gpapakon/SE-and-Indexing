<ABSTRACT>
An information recording method in which a 
recording start position of a data section in which 

file data of a recording medium such as an optical card 
has been recorded is calculated on the basis of a 

directory for managing a file of the information 
recording medium recorded in a directory section and, 

when the data has been recorded at the calculated 
recording start position, a retry operation to judge 

whether the data has been recorded at the next 
recording position or not is repeated a predet
ermined 
number of times, thereby retrieving the final recording 

position of the data section. When the final recording 
position of the data section cannot be detected even if 

the retry operation was repeated the predetermined 
number of times, the information indicative of the 

recording position at which the retry operation was 
finally executed is recorded to the directory section. 

When performing the retry operation again, the retry 
operation is executed from the recording position at 

which the retry operation was finally performed on the 
basis of the information indicative of the recording 

position at which the retry operation was finally 
executed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording method for recording information to an
information recording medium such as an optical card or
the like.Hitherto, as a form of a recording medium to which
information is optically recorded or from which
recorded information is optically read out, various
kinds of forms such as disk shape, card shape, tape
shape, and the like are known. Among them, the card-shaped
recording medium (hereinbelow, referred to as an
optical card) has a small size and a light weight and
is convenient to carry and, further, has a large
recording capacity. Therefore, a large demand is
expected as a write once type recording medium in the
future.In case of recording or reproducing information
to/from such an optical card, generally, information is
managed every file by using management information
(hereinafter, referred to as a directory) for managing
file data. The directory comprises information such as
file name, file length, track number of head data, and
the like which are necessary for the file management. 
The directory is written into a part of the optical
card.Fig. 1 is a plan view showing the recording
surface of the optical card. A number of tracking
tracks 31 to 3n+1 are arranged in parallel in an
information recording area 2 of an optical card 1.
Information tracks 41 to 4n to record information are
provided among the tracking tracks. Physical track
numbers 51 to 5n to discriminate the information tracks
have been recorded in the both edge portions of the
information tracks.The information recording area 2 is divided into a
data section 10 to record file data and a directory
section 20 to record a directory. In the data section
10, one information track is divided into two sectors.
In the directory section 20, one information track is
divided into four sectors. In case of recording the
file data, it is sequentially recorded in accordance
with the order such that data 101, 102, 103, ... from
the sector on the left side of the information track 4n
on the upper side on the diagram. On the other hand,
in case of recording the directory, it is sequentially
recorded in accordance with the order such that
directories 201, 202, 203, ... from the sector on the
left side of the information track 41 on the lower side
on the diagram.In this instance, it is assumed that data of a 
file C having a capacity of six sectors is recorded to
the optical card in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 is a diagram
showing a state in which the data has been recorded in
this instance. In Fig. 2, a sector

<CLAIMS>
An information recording method in which a
recording start position of a data section in which

file data of a recording medium has been recorded is
calculated on the basis of a directory for managing a

file of said information recording medium recorded in a
directory section and, when the data has been recorded

in said calculated recording start position, a retry
operation to judge whether data has been recorded at a

next recording position or not is repeated a
predetermined number of times, thereby retrieving a

final recording position of said data section, characterized by:

a step of recording, into said directory section,
information indicative of said recording position at

which said retry operation was finally executed in the
case where said final recording position of said data

section cannot be detected by repeating said retry
operation said predetermined number of times.
A method according to claim 1, further
including:


a step of performing said retry operation from
said recording position at which said retry operation

was finally executed on the basis of the information
indicative of said recording position at which the

retry operation was finally executed in the case where 
said retry operation is again executed.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the
information indicative of said recording position at

which the retry operation was finally executed is
recorded to said directory section as a directory having

a format different from a format of the directory which
is used by a user.
An information recording method comprising the
steps of:


calculating the position of the end of the recorded
data on a recording medium, and recording the position

in a directory;
detecting the recorded position, characterized in that
the last detected

recording position is recorded in the directory when said position of the end of the recorded data cannot be detected.
