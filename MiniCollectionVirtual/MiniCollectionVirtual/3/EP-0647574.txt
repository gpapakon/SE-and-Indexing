<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device mounted on a 
refuse collection vehicle (1) for emptying waste containers 

(4) into a receiving container (5) of the refuse collection 
vehicle (1). By means of an image sensor (6), one or more 

ready waste containers (4) are detected and displayed on a 
viewing screen (7) in the driver's cab (8). With means 

provided in the driver's cab (8), one of the waste 
containers (4) can then be selected for emptying by means 

of the image displayed on the viewing screen (7), following 
which a jib (2) mounted on the refuse collection vehicle 

(1) moves towards the selected waste container (4) on the 
basis of control signals generated by the device, lifts 

said waste container up and moves it into a position in 
which it can be emptied. 
The device also comprises means for reading out 
information provided on a waste container (4) to be 

emptied, as well as recording means for storing 
information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a device is known from the European patent
application published under number 0 388 618.In a refuse collection vehicle provided with such a
device, an image displayed on a viewing screen in the
driver's cab is assessed by operating an activating
switch and the jib can automatically lift up and empty
any ready waste containers under the control of a computing
unit. One disadvantage when using such a
device is the fact that, when there is more than one
waste container in the image field to be assessed, the
selection of a specific waste container by the jib cannot
be influenced by the driver.The object of the present invention is to provide a
device which does not have this disadvantage and
which allows the emptying of the waste containers to be
carried out in a more flexible manner. To this end, according to the invention, there is provided a device as described in claim 1.In this manner, by means of a device according to
the invention, waste containers can be lifted up and
emptied in a safe manner using a jib.Some advantageous embodiments of the device
according to the invention are defined in subclaims 2-10.The invention will now be explained in greater detail
with reference to the attached drawing, in which:
Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows a front view of a
refuse collection vehicle provided with a device
according to the invention;Fig. 2 shows a possible image on a viewing screen
in the driver's cab of the refuse collection vehicle;
andFig. 3 shows an illustrative embodiment of a data
carrier for a waste container.  In Fig. 1, a refuse collection vehide or refuse lorry
is designated by reference numeral 1 and is equipped
with a jib 2, which is intended for lifting up waste containers
4 placed along the side of the street 3 and ready
for emptying, and emptying them into a receiving container
5 of the refuse lorry 1. To this end, the jib 2 is provided
with controllable motors 2a.In order to be able to execute the operations
involved largely automatically, the refuse lorry 1 is
equipped with a camera 6, in particular a CCD camera,
the recorded images of which can be displayed on a
viewing screen 7 (see also Fig. 2) in the driver's cab 8 of
the refuse lorry 1. The camera 6 is directed towards the
side of the street 3, in particular when the refuse lorry 1
is moving, in this case the right-hand side, where any
waste containers 4 may be placed ready for emptying.
In particular, the camera 6 is equipped with a lens having
a large angle

<CLAIMS>
Device, mounted on a refuse collection vehicle (1),
for emptying waste containers (4) into a receiving

container of the refuse collection vehicle, comprising:

detection means for detecting at least one
waste container ready for emptying,
position determining means for determining the

position of a waste container to be emptied relative
to the refuse collection vehicle,
a jib (2) mounted on the refuse collection vehicle
for lifting up a waste container to be emptied

and for moving the waste container into a
position in which it can be emptied,
first jib control means for automatically controlling
the jib on the basis of signals generated by

the position determining means dependent
upon the position of the waste container to be

emptied relative to the refuse collection vehicle,

in which the detection means comprise a first
image sensor (6), a viewing screen (7)

is installed in the driver's cab of the refuse collection
vehicle for displaying an image containing one or move containers recorded by the

first image sensor, characterized in that the device
also comprises selection means arranged in the

driver's cab (8) by means of which a waste container
to be emptied can be selected from the

image displayed on the viewing screen (7), and in
that the selection means allow driver to point at a displayed waste container (4) to thereby determine the container as the container to be emptied.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the viewing screen (7) is a touch screen by means

of which a waste container (4) to be emptied can be
selected from the image displayed on the viewing

screen.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the device comprises reading means for reading

out information provided on a waste container
(4) to be emptied, as well as recording means for

storing information.
Device according to daim 3, characterized in that
the reading means comprise a second image sensor

(10) mounted on the jib.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the device comprises second

jib control means for manually operating the jib (2).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the device comprises pattern

identifying means for aligning the jib (2) relative to
the waste container (4) to be emptied prior to the

gripping thereof.
Device according to one of claims 3-6, characterized
in that the jib (2) comprises weighing means

with which the weight of a waste container (4) to be
emptied can be determined, and in that the recording
