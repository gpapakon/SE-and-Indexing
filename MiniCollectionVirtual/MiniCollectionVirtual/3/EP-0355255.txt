<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrically driven pump unit composed of an electric motor 2 arranged in a casing 1 and of a pump 4 and also of a connection module 8, which is connected to a measuring device 7 for the electrical or hydraulic operating variables of motor 2 or pump 4, and to which a further module 9 is detachably fastened. For simplified continuous registration of the operating variables of the unit, the further module 9 is designed in such a way that it contains a memory unit 12 and/or an indicating unit 10, 11, by means of which the operating variables can be registered outside the casing. In this manner, error diagnostics can be carried out very simply on pump units in the operating state or in the installed state.
