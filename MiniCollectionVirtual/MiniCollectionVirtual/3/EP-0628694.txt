<ABSTRACT>
Corner or crossbar connection (11) for frame profiles (12, 13), in particular for window or door frames, having a connector (14) which is to be fastened on the two frame profiles (12, 13), engages into a closed chamber (15) of one of the frame profiles (12) and is secured there against being drawn out of the profile (12). In order to improve a corner or crossbar connection (11) having the features mentioned in the introduction, such that a sealed connection, unaffected by building tolerances, between two frame profiles (12, 13) can be produced, it is designed such that the connector (14) has at least one latching strip (16) with a multiplicity of securing catches which are arranged one behind the other and are provided, in the same design, over more than half of the length of the connector (14).
