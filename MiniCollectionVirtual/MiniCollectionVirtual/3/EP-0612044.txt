<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin wrapping 
apparatus for wrapping a predetermined number of coins and, 
in particular, to a compact coin wrapping apparatus which 
can wrap a predetermined number of coins in a desired manner 
with a mechanism of simple structure. A coin wrapping machine generally includes a coin 
stacking apparatus for stacking a predetermined number of 
coins in a roll-like manner and a coin wrapping apparatus 
comprising three wrapping rollers for winding a wrapping 
film such a paper, a transparent or semitransparent plastic 
film or the like around the coins stacked by the coin stacking 
apparatus, a coin support means for receiving the 
stacked coins from the coin stacking apparatus and transferring 
them to between the three wrapping rollers and an upper 
crimp claw and a lower crimp claw for crimping the upper 
portion and the lower portion of the wrapping film wound 
around the stacked coins. Since the coin diameter differs depending upon the 
denomination of the coins to be wrapped, the coin wrapping 
apparatus is provided with a cam mechanism and a link mechanism 
for moving the three wrapping rollers and the pair of 
crimp claws in accordance with the denominations of coins to 
be wrapped.  
 A coin wrapping apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 
is known from US-Patent No. 4,219,985. However, the thus constituted coin wrapping apparatus 
has a lot of cams and, correspondingly, a lot of link mechanisms 
and, therefore, inevitably becomes large. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a compact coin wrapping apparatus which can wrap a  
 
predetermined number of coins in a desired manner with a 
mechanism of simple structure. The above and other objects of the present invention 
can be accomplished by a coin wrapping apparatus according to 
the preamble of claim 1, which further comprises the features of 
the characterizing part of claim 1.  
 In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the 
coin support member moving mechanism comprises a coin support 
arm member having a bore whose inner surface is formed 
with an internal thread and the coin support member formed 
on one end portion thereof, the first coin support member 
moving means comprises a rotatable shaft formed with an 
external thread which can engage with the internal thread of 
the coin support arm member and the second coin support 
member moving means comprises swing means swingable about 
the rotatable shaft together with the coin support arm 
member so that the first
