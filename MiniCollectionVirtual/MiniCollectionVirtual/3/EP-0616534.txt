<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOCKING THE EFFECT OF TERATOGENS ON A FETUSThis invention relates to a method for blocking the effect of a teratogen on a fetus by administration of a sulfated cyclodextrin to a pregnant mother.Blocking the effect of teratogens with sulfated 5 cyclodextrin prevents congenital birth defects in some cases and in other cases reduces the effect of the teratogen on the fetus.Congenital birth defects are defects which originated in an organism during development in the I Q uterus and which are not necessarily due to heredity. Teratogens include radiation, temperature extremes, chemicals, drugs, bacteria, viruses, hormones, stress, injury, pregnancy, and fatigue.Teratogens affect the developing organism in a 5 pathological sense and can result in congenital defects such as prenatal defects, structural defects, functional defects, behavioral defects, or an increased likelihood of cancer.Prenatal defects occur in over 45% of conceptions. 0 Over 30% of these defects are manifested before implantation of the embryo in the uterus and result in reabsorption of the embryo without further development.Approximately 15% of prenatal defects result in spontaneous miscarriage. 

 Structural defects occur in approximately 3% of viable births. Structural defects are visible abnormalities in the structure of the fetus at birth. Functional defects occur in an additional approximately 7% of births. Functional defects do not manifest themselves until some period after birth wherein a system does not perform its function, e.g. a learning disability which is generally not detectable at birth. Additionally, another 20% of births involve infants with behavioral defects which are caused by an in utero induced abnormality. These defects are also generally only discovered later in life and are not apparent in the newborn infant. A higher likelihood of cancer is another congenital birth defect which may result from in utero exposure to an oncogenic agent. About 80-85% of cancers are induced by the genetic and congenital makeÂ¬ up of the organism and may be triggered by one or more oncogenic agents, or a combination thereof. Oncogenic agents and teratogens are in many instances the same. It is known that teratogens cause birth defects. However, it is not known if the teratogen affects the mother, the fetus, or both. It is also not known how the teratogen causes the congenital birth defect. It is believed that one possible point of damage by teratogens is the interferon component of the immune system of the fetus. Interferon is a low

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A process for reducing or blocking the effect of a teratogen in a host in need of such treatment comprising treating said host with an effective amount of a sulfated cyclodextrin in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
2. The process of claim 2 wherein said cyclodextrin is beta cyclodextrin.
3. The process of claim 1 wherein said host is treated with said cyclodextrin before exposure to said teratogen.
4. The process of claim 1 wherein said host is treated with said cyclodextrin after exposure to said teratogen.
5. A composition of matter comprising as an essential ingredient therein a sulfated cyclodextrin in an amount effective to reduce or block a congenital defect together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
6. The composition of claim 5 wherein the sulfated cyclodextrin is beta cyclodextrin. 


only reduces gross anatomical defects, but also blocks to some degree low birth weight associated with teratogens.
It will be understood that the claims are intended to cover all changes and modifications of the preferred embodiments of the invention herein chosen for the purpose of illustration which do not constitute a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.
