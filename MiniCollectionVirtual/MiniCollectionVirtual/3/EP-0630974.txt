<ABSTRACT>
The presence of amplified nucleic acids can 
be identified by detecting the presence of inorganic 

orthophosphate which is a stable by-product of the 
amplification process. There are a number of useful 

detection systems which can be used in either solution 
or dry formats. A preferred embodiment is to use a dry 

analytical element containing suitable reagents for 
generating a colorimetric signal in response to the 

orthophosphate. A diagnostic test kit can include 
individually packaged reagents for both amplification 

and orthophosphate detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diagnostic methods 
for the detection of nucleic acids by monitoring the 
production of a by-product associated with 
amplification procedures. In particular, it relates to 
a test kit and a method to detect a target nucleic acid 
by measuring the inorganic orthophosphate generated 
when the target nucleic acid is amplified using various 
amplification procedures, including polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). Technology to detect minute quantities of 
nucleic acids has advanced rapidly over the last two 
decades including the development of highly 
sophisticated hybridization assays using probes in 
amplification techniques such as PCR, ligase chain 
reaction and self-sustained sequence replication. 
Researchers have readily recognized the value of such 
technologies to detect diseases and genetic features in 
human or animal test specimens. In particular, PCR is a significant advance 
in the art to allow detection of very small 
concentrations of a target nucleic acid. The details 
of PCR are described, for example, in US-A-4,683,195; 
US-A-4,683,202; and US-A-4,965,188; although there is a 
rapidly expanding volume of literature in this field. Despite the broad and rapid use of PCR in a 
variety of biological and diagnostic fields, there are 
still practical limitations which must be overcome to 
achieve the optimum success of the technology. PCR requires considerable expensive reagents, 
especially in various detection systems. Detection of 
the amplified target nucleic acid has generally 
required the use of ethidium bromide gels or expensive  
 
capture and detection probes. The use of such 
materials requires additional tedious steps and 
requires expenses which a user would like to avoid. 
The more steps that are required in PCR, the greater 
the likelihood of contamination from one assay to 
another since PCR is a highly powerful means of 
amplifying nucleic acids in a specimen besides the 
target nucleic acid. Workers in the field are 
expending considerable effort to reduce the problem of 
contaminants. Many conventional methods of PCR also 
use either or both a capture probe or detection probe 
which requires a third oligonucleotide (besides the 
primers) which is complementary to at least one of the 
amplified strands. There are many instances where it 
would be advisable to avoid detection or capture 
probes. WO 92/16654 describes methods for 
amplification of target nucleic acids and detection of 
the resulting pyrophosphate by-product using 
chemiluminescent or
