<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor product logic chip (20) including a logic 
network (27-1) to be fed by a tie-up/tie-down circuit (21-1). 

A tie-up/tie-down circuit is comprised of a non-inverting 
buffer book (22-1) whose input terminal (23-1) is 

controlled from the outside by a connection (25) to a 
primary input terminal (24) of the said chip. Its output 

terminal (26-1) is connected to said logic network. The 
primary input terminal is connected to a voltage supply 

means (29) capable of supplying a constant supply voltage 
VDD/GND in the SYSTEM mode and a supply voltage varying 

between VDD and GND, during the TEST mode. When the chip 
operates in the SYSTEM mode, the supply voltage means is 

the VDD/GND power supply, so that the primary input terminal 
is directly tied to the VDD/GND power supply. As a 

result, the tie-up/tie-down circuit generates a steady 
logic level "1"/"0" on its output terminal. Unlike, in the 

TEST mode, the voltage supply means consists of the tester 
generator so that the tie-up/tie-down circuit follows the 

tester stimuli sequence. As a result, the output terminal 
of the tie-up/tie-down circuit switches between the "1" 

and "0" logic levels depending on the tester stimuli. This 
allows the tester to detect all the stuck-at faults in the 

logic network. In this mode, the tie-up/tie-down function 
is not realized, since its output terminal is set to either 

the "0" and "1" logic levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the testing of product 
semiconductor logic product chips including numerous complex 
logic networks for carrying on data processing operations 
that have "stuck-at" faults and more particularly to 
tie-up and tie-down circuits provided with a connection to 
a primary input to improve the testability of such complex 
logic networks, and thereby the final quality of the said 
semiconductor product logic chips. In semiconductor product logic chips, such as ASIC chips, 
a high level of testability is required in order to eliminate 
all defective parts. A test coverage of more than 
99.9% is usually expected with advanced semiconductor 
technologies. The test coverage is a function of the predicted 
yield and the targeted Shipped Product Quality 
Level (SPQL) at system level. Circuits such as tie-up 
and/or tie-down circuits are often used for functionality 
purposes in combination with combinational logic books to 
form complex logic networks. As a matter of fact, a short 
to the VDD power supply would be equivalent to a tie-up 
function (which generates a logic "1"), and a short to the 
ground (GND) power supply would be equivalent to a tie-down 
function (which generates a logic "0"). Admittedly, 
these tie-up/tie-down circuits are testability killers in 
some respect with the current "stuck-at" fault model because 
they prevent fault activation/sensitization or fault 
extraction. For example, if the input and/or the output of 
a logic book is continuously forced to a determined logic 
value, it cannot be completely tested. Unfortunately, the 
stuck-at fault model does not always correlate with the 
actual hardware faults, especially when the CMOS technology  
 
is employed. However, the technical community agrees to 
consider this model the only acceptable one to calculate 
efficiently the testability of the high density ASIC chips 
designed to date. The testability is calculated over the 
"flat" structure of the complete design built from elementary 
logic books such as AND, NAND, OR, NOR, ..., etc. To 
each input and output of these elementary books is assigned 
two data: one "stuck-at-1" and one "stuck-at-0". 
The stuck-at-1 indicates the wiring net which is connected 
to the input (or output) is blocked (stuck) to the logic 
level "1", while the stuck-at-0 indicates the wiring net 
is blocked to the logic level "0". As is known to those skilled in the art, 
before a product chip is shipped in a system to the customer, 
it is extensively tested in the manufacturing
