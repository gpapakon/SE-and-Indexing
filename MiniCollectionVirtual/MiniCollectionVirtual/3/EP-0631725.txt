<ABSTRACT>
Baking trolley which comprises a support base (1), with rolling means (2), to which base there is fastened, on one of its lateral sides, a vertical bar (3) on which bar there are mounted numerous tray-holder frames (4) by means of tubular elements (5) secured to one of their sides. These tubular elements (5) allow each tray holder (4) to pivot independently on the vertical bar (3), and are separated along the bar (3) by limit stops (8) which cannot pivot, which act as dividers and which prevent the weight of each tray from falling down onto those below. A tray (6) is placed on each tray holder (4), and several portions of dough are placed in this tray for making patisserie, bakery, or viennese bread products. The baking trolley additionally comprises means for immobilising the tray holders (4) in a given position.
