<ABSTRACT>
The active substance in the pharmaceutical composition of at least one alkali-sensitive active substance with an effervescent system is embedded in at least one of the following compounds: an edible organic acid, a higher alcohol, a hydrocolloid, a long-chain polyvinylpyrrolidone, preferably covered with at least one of the said compounds. The carbonate constituent is preferably also embedded in at least one edible organic acid and preferably covered by the same or a different acid. The contact zone between active substance and effervescent system should have a pH not exceeding 4.5. Particles both of effervescent system and of active substance which are embedded and, where appropriate, covered in this way can be applied to carrier crystals of the same or a different acid. The mixture is preferably compressed to tablets. The acid intended for the embedding or covering can contain 0.1 to 3 mg of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid per tablet.

<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical formulation in the form of a 
mixture of at least one alkali- and/or metal-sensitive 

active ingredient with an effervescent system 
comprising at least one alkali metal carbonate or 

alkaline earth metal carbonate or alkali metal 
bicarbonate or alkaline earth metal bicarbonate and at 

least one solid, edible, organic acid, characterized in 
that the active ingredient is covered by at least one 

of the following compounds: a solid, edible, organic 
acid - excluding fumaric acid - such as citric acid, 

tartaric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid or adipic 
acid; a polyhydric alcohol, such as, for example, 

mannitol, sorbitol, or xylitol; a hydrocolloid, such 
as, for example, maltodextrin, guar gum, gelatine or 

gum arabic; a solution of a relatively high molecular 
weight polyvinylpyrrolidone, preferably embedded in 

such a compound, the formulation optionally being 
compressed to give tablets. 
Formulation according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the carbonate components and at least a part of 

the acidic components of the effervescent system are 
applied to carrier crystals of at least one solid, 

edible, organic acid - preferably as a mixture with or 
embedded in the same or another edible, organic acid - 

and are optionally also covered with the same or 
another solid, edible, organic acid. 
Formulation according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the active ingredient particles 

are applied to carrier crystals of at least one Solid, 
edible, organic acid and either embedded in at least 

one, or covered with at least one, of the stated 
compounds. 
Formulation according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the carbonate components and at least a part of 

the acidic components of the effervescent system are  
 

granulated and are preferably covered with the same or 
another solid, edible, organic acid. 
Formulation according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the active ingredient particles are present as 

a mixture with at least one of the stated compounds. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the acid provided for the 

embedding or covering contains ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid, preferably 0.01 to 2 parts by weight for 

covering 100 parts by weight of effervescent granules, 
and preferably 0.05 to 2 parts by weight for covering 

100 parts by weight of active ingredient phase. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the active ingredient is 

an ACE inhibitor, in particular captopril. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the outer coat of the 

effervescent system has a pH of not more than 4.5. 
Process for the preparation of a formulation 
according to any of the preceding Claims, characterized 

in that an effervescent phase and an active ingredient 
phase are prepared separately from one another and then 

mixed and optionally compressed to give tablets, the 
effervescent phase being formed by embedding powdered 

alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal carbonates or 
bicarbonates, and the active ingredient phase by 

embedding powdered active ingredient particles, in each 
case in granular particles comprising an edible, 

organic acid. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the granular particles of the effervescent phase 

and/or of the active ingredient phase are covered by a 
coat of at least one of the following compounds: an 

edible, organic acid, such as, for example, citric 
acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid or 

adipic acid; a polyhydric alcohol, such as, for 
example, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol; a hydrocolloid,  

 
such as, for example, maltodextrin, guar gum, gelatine 

or gum arabic; a solution of a relatively high 
molecular w
eight polyvinylpyrrolidone - optionally in 
the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid - 

preferably in a vacuum mixing drum. 
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that about 1 to about 5 mg of ethylenediaminetetraacetic 

acid are embedded in the coat per tablet weight.
