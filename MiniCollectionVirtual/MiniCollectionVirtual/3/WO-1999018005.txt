<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device in a bundle tie. This comprises an elongated tie part (2) of a certain width and thickness, which at one end has an elongated insertion part (3) of lesser width than the tie part (2) and at its other end has a locking head (1) with a through-opening (6) for the tie part (2). The opening has essentially the same width as the tie part (2), but a height greater than the thickness of the tie part (2). In one transverse wall of the opening is a slit (7), the width of which is such that it allows the insertion part (3) to be inserted into the opening (6) via the slit (7), forming a tie loop, interacting elements designed to lock the tie part (2) in relation to the locking head (1) being provided on the tie part (2) and in the locking head (1). The said locking elements take the form of a tongue (8) which, emerging from the bottom of the opening (6) at one end of the opening (6), extends approximately diagonally towards the other end of the opening (6) and towards the slit (7). The locking elements are designed to positively and detachably interlock in one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
Locking deviceDevice in a bundle tie comprising an elongated tie part of a certain width and thickness, which at one end has an elongated insertion part of lesser width than the tie part and at its other end has a locking head with a through-opening for the tie part, which has essentially the same width as the tie part but a height greater than the thickness of the tie part, and a slit in one transverse wall of the opening, the width of which is such that it allows the insertion part to be inserted into the opening via the slit, forming a tie loop, interacting elements designed to lock the tie part detachably in relation to the locking head being provided on the tie part and in the opening of the locking head.The application of the design defined above in order to produce a bundle tie is exemplified in Swedish patent No. 9404328-8, publication No. 503217. This known design, however, has inherent disadvantages, which to a large extent limit the use thereof, because of inadequate technical characteristics and for cost reasons, especially on the manufacturing side, due to high tooling costs and other time-consuming manufacturing problems that increase costs. In addition to lower costs, there is also a desire to achieve better technical characteristics, especially greater ease of use, without having to sacrifice the locking efficiency. Moreover, new technical characteristics are sought, such as easy release and opening of the lock of a fitted bundle tie which is applied by placing it around a cable bundle, for example, and tightened in order to reduce the space required for the cable bundle. Tightening intensifies the locking action, making easy release or opening of the tie fundamentally impossible. When wishing to release or open known bundle ties, this generally leads to the tie being destroyed by cutting it open.The object of the present invention is to effect these desired improvements and remove the above-mentioned disadvantages in the device defined in the introductory part.The present invention achieves this object in the device specified in the introductory part in that the said locking elements take the form of a tongue, extending approximately diagonally from the bottom of the opening at one end of the opening towards the other end of the opening and towards the slit, and that the said elements are designed to positively interlock in one another. 

According to a particular characteristic, the tongue extends out through the hole to form a release part. The locking elements on the tongue and on
