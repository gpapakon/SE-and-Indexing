<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic radial passenger car
tyre as specified in the preambles of the independent claims and having an improved carcass structure, in which
steering performances are improved without
increasing the tyre weight.In general, a pneumatic radial tyre, especially a
passenger radial tyre is provided with a carcass
made of one or two plies of radially arranged cords.In the case of one carcass ply, usually, the ply is
turned up around bead the cores from the inside to
the outside of the tyre to be secured thereto.In the case of two carcass plies, 1) both of them
are turned up around bead cores, or 2) one of them
is turned up around the bead cores and the other is
turned down around the bead cores from the axially
outside.In either case, by providing a bead apex of high-rigidity
rubber and increasing the carcass ply
turnup height, the tyre sidewall portions are
provided with rigidity so as to increase the lateral 
stiffness of the tyre to obtain the desired steering
performance.Steering performance is however, a contradictory
requirement to tyre weight reduction.In order to improve steering performances, if, as
usual, the carcass ply number and the turnup heights
thereof are increased, and/or the bead apex height
is increased, the tyre weight inevitably increases.On the other hand, if to reduce the tyre weight the
carcass ply turnup height and/or bead apex height
are decreased, steering performances are
deteriorated.Thus, it is very difficult to satisfy both
requirements in a tyre, whereas the recent
improvements in vehicle performance and fuel
consumption greatly require a light weight tyre.A tyre for a motorcycle having a rubber spacer
inserted in the sidewall
is known from US-A-4770222. However in
this known tyre the carcass cord angles are 
specifically limited in the range of 50 to 65
degrees and thus the tyre is not a radial tyre. EP-A-0535938 shows a tyre in accordance with the preambles of the independent claims. This document discloses a cord spacing in the range from 1 to 10 times the diameter of the cords,
in particular the value 4.4.It is therefore, an object of the present invention
to provide a pneumatic radial tyre in which steering
performances are improved, without increasing the
tyre weight.According to the present invention
there is provided a pneumatic radial passenger car tyre in
accordance with the independent claims 1 to 6. The upper sidewall region between the axially outer
edge of the belt and the maximum tyre width position
is subjected to a large
