<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel substituted
tertiary amino compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof having an aromatase inhibiting activity and useful as
a drug, a process for preparing the same, and a
pharmaceutical composition containing the same.It is known that an enzyme, aromatase, takes part in
the final stage of biosynthesis of estrogen. Aromatase
aromatizes the ring A of the steroid and uses androgen as a
substrate to produce an estrogen. Inhibition of the
aromatase activity leads to prevention and treatment of
various diseases in which an estrogen participates as an
exacerbating factor.Several aromatase inhibiting compounds have hitherto
been proposed based on the above concept. Typical examples
of known aromatase inhibiting compounds include imidazolyl-,
triazolyl-, pyridyl- or pyrimidyl-substituted methyl
compounds disclosed in EP-B-236940, EP-B-293978, U.S. Patent
No. 4,762,836, and J. Med. Chem., Vol. 33, p. 416 (1990).Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,774,251 describes that a
compound having a pyridyl- or pyrazyl-substituted tertiary
amino group and one or two phenyl groups, as represented by 
the following general formula, exhibits an aromatase
inhibiting activity.

(cf. U.S. Patent 4,774,251 as to definitions of the symbols)The compound according to the present invention is
distinctly different in structure from any of the compounds
found in the above-described literature in that it contains a
pyrimidine ring, a pyridazine ring or a triazine ring as a
basic structure.Additionally, the compound of the present invention
has been proved highly useful as it has 100 times or more the
aromatase inhibiting activity of the compound disclosed in
the literature.EP-A-0 384 370 discloses amino pyrimidine compounds
which can be similar to those of the present invention
but proposes them only for screening aldose reductase
inhibitors.The substituted tertiary amino compound of the
present invention is represented by the general formula (I): 

wherein A represents a single bond, a lower alkylene group or
a group represented by formula:

   wherein n represents an integer of from 1 to 6, and X
represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a group
represented by formula: CH2;
ring B represents a pyrimidine ring, a pyridazine ring or a
triazine ring;and rings D and E, which may be the same or different, each
represent a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a
substituted or unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic
group containing 1 to 3 hetero atoms each selected from a
nitrogen atom, an
