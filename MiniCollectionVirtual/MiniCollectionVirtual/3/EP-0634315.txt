<ABSTRACT>
A steering mechanism for a tractor having a transverse 
axle (15) with pivotally movable steering wheels (17) and a 

laterally shiftable chassis (11) is disclosed wherein a first 
tie rod (28) interconnects the steering arms (27) of the 

opposing steerable wheels (17) to couple the movements thereof 
and a second tie rod (50) interconnects the chassis (11) and 

the first tie rod (28) to couple the laterally shifting 
movements of the chassis (11) to the pivotal movements of the 

steerable wheels (17). The second tie rod (50) is selectively 
re-positionable to the transverse axle (15) to disassociate the 

lateral shifting movements of the chassis (11) from the pivotal 
movements of the steerable wheels (17), thereby allowing a 

selection between a compound steering operation and a 
conventional-type simple steering operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a steering mechanism 
for an agricultural tractor in which the front axle is 
laterally shiftable in response to a steering movement of the 
steerable wheels and, more particularly, to a tie rod 
configuration for controlling the lateral movements of a 
chassis in response to the pivotal movements of the steerable 
wheels. Tractors, whether used in an agricultural setting or in an 
industrial setting, typically include a fixed axle through 
which primary driving power is transferred through fixed wheels 
rotatably mounted on opposing ends of the fixed axle, and a 
steering axle having pivotally mounted steerable ground 
engaging wheels rotatably mounted on the opposing ends thereof 
to support the chassis of the tractor above the ground. 
Supplemental driving power is often provided through the 
steerable ground engaging wheels, while a steering mechanism 
remotely controllable by the operator from the operator's 
compartment selectively controls the pivotal movement of the 
steerable wheels relative to the steering axle. One such steering mechanism incorporates a transversely 
disposed, horizontally extending hydraulic cylinder supported 
by the steering axle and connected to the opposing steerable 
wheels. This hydraulic cylinder affects pivotal movement of the 
steerable wheels about their respective pivotal connections to 
the steering axle by manipulating the pressures in the 
hydraulic cylinder to effect a transverse displacement of the 
cylinder rod, causing a turning of the wheels. Due to physical limitations relating to the range of 
movement of the steering mechanism and to the eventual 
interference between the steerable wheels and the steering axle 
or chassis frame, the amount of pivotal movement of the 
steerable wheels relative to the steering axle is limited by  
 
tire size and track setting to a given restricted turning 
angle. This maximum turning angle defines the minimum turning 
radius of the tractor for a given chassis clearance width, axle 
oscillation angle, wheel base length and king pin spacing. The 
selection of the length of the wheel base, i.e., the distance 
between the fixed axle and the steering axle, is a compromise 
between the need to minimize the turning radius and, therefore, 
minimize the wheel base length, and to maximize ride 
considerations which require longer wheel base lengths. These conflicting wheel base requirements can be better 
resolved by a steering mechanism incorporating a laterally 
shifting front axle that is
