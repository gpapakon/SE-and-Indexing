<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photoreceptor is provided with a photosensitive 
layer, which contains an azo compoun
d represented by the followin 
g general formula (1): 


wherein A means a coupler residuum having phenolic OH radicals, R₁ and 
R₂ designate, respectively, a radical of an integer of, both, m=0∼4, n 

=0∼4, selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen atoms, 
alkyl group, alkoxy group, and di-substituted amino group. 
The electrophotographic photoreceptor of this invention has excellent 
electrification characteristics, sensitivity characteristics and image-forming 

property as well as good sensitivity. In addition, its sensitivity 
and electrification characteristics undergo less variations even when 

employed repeatedly. It also undergoes little light-induced fatigue. It 
has high weatherability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor containing 
a photosensitive layer which contains a specific azo compound as carrier producing material. In recent years, the utility of electrophotography was not limited 
to the field of copying machines but has expanded to various other fields 
where photographic techniques have conventionally been used, such as 
printing plates, slide films and microfilms. Investigations are also 
under way in order to apply electrophotography to high-speed printers 
which make use of a laser or LED as a light source. The demand is hence 
moving toward a wide variety of electrophotographic photoreceptors of 
higher quality. As photoreceptors for electrophotography, those having a photosensitive 
layer composed of an inorganic photoconductive material such as 
amorphous selenium, cadmium sulfide or zinc oxide as a principal 
component have been used primarily to date. Although photoreceptors 
formed of these inorganic materials are useful, they are still accompanied 
by various drawbacks. With a view toward making improvements to the above drawbacks, 
electrophotographic photoreceptors making use of various organic materials 
as photoconductive materials have been proposed and have started finding 
practical utility in recent years. Needless to say, an electrophotographic  
 
photoreceptor must have both carrier producing function and carrier 
transporting function. As organic compounds usable as carrier producing 
materials, numerous pigments have been proposed such as phthalocyanine 
type pigments, polycyclic quinoline type pigments, indigo type pigments, 
dioxazine type pigments, quinacridone type pigments and azo type pigments. 
There are however very few pigments which have been put to practical use. 
Since a carrier transporting substance can be chosen only from a limited 
range, it has not been obtained under the circumstances any carrier 
transporting substance which can meet satisfactorily the diversified 
demands for the electrophotographic process. The present inventors have carried out an investigation with a view 
toward making improvements to organic electrophotographic photoreceptors. 
As a result, it has been found that an electrophotographic photoreceptor 
provided with a photosensitive layer containing an azo compound represented 
by the following general formula (1), has super electrophotographic 
characteristics, leading to the present invention.

R2 designate,
