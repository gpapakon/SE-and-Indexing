<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device making it possible to fire low-power ammunition over a short distance with a large-calibre (bore) weapon. This device comprises:   - a reducing tube (1) locked forwards at the end of a chamber (2) of the basic weapon by a tapered bell socket (3), - one or more tubular transfer casings reproducing part of the tubular casing (4) of the basic bore, and with a chamber (5) open towards the front to receive the reduced ammunition, a breech (6) activated via a compression spring (7) and locked in the firing position by a push-button (8).   At this stage, the transfer tubular bush or bushes are inserted or extracted as desired using the mechanism of the basic weapon. For firing, a striker relay (9) compensated by a spring (10) extends the action of the striker of the basic weapon, converting the central striking into annular striking. The device according to the invention is particularly intended for rifle practice in a small space.

Device for firing low strength ammunition using rifled barrel hunting 
rifles, this device comprising of a transfer cartridge (4) to be taken into the 

chamber of such a hunting rifle, the named transfer cartridge (4) having : 

a chamber (5) open towards the front to house ammunition of 
reduced calibre, 
a lateral opening (15) to insert such ammunition, 
an adjustable gun lock (6) fixed in the named cartridge 

it comprises a reducing tube (1) 
the named transfer cartridge (4) is equipped with a cartridge 
case (11) provided for at the back of the named transfer 

cartridge (4) and a multi-function return spring which activates 
the named adjustable gun lock (6). 
the named adjustable gun lock (6) is equipped with a 
diametric and through borehole (14), this borehole (14) 

holding a locking push button (8) of the named gun lock (6) ; 
the named multi-function spring (7) has two ends (16 and 17) 
inclined at a right-angle in the same longitudinal plane, one 

(16) of these ends (16 and 17) crossing a diametric drilling (18) 
of the named locking push button (8), the other (17) (16 and 

17) being connected to the named cartridge case (11), the 
action of the named multi-function spring being such that it : 
pushes the named adjustable gun lock (6) forwards, the 
direction being defined by the bullet's direction of exit; 
incites the named locking push button (8) to come out to a 
certain limited position ensured by contact with the upper 

generator of the named adjustable gun lock (6) in a front 
position behind the loaded ammunition. 
Device according to the claim characterised as the reducing 
tube (1) has a collar with a compact end in concentric male female cone. 
Device according to claim (1) and claim 2 characterised by the 
fact that one or several transfer cartridges can be used in the case of a 

repeating weapon. 
Device according to claim (1) characterised by the fact that a 
firing pin relay (9) controlled in position by the return spring (10) and the 

rod of the locking push button (8) re-transmits the impact of the basic gun's 
firing pin.
