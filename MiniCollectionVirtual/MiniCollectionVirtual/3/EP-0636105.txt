<ABSTRACT>
A system for control of automatic refuelling automotive vehicles parked alongside a fuel dispenser unit comprises a communication means (10), for starting, monitoring and finishing a refuelling procedure, operating control units (31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) for controlling a number of operating functions involved within said refuelling procedure and to be carried out by respective operating units; and a central processing unit (20) for processing and communicating data signals, the data signals processed being conducted to said operating control units. Said communication means is arranged within the vehicle to be refuelled. During said refuelling procedure, it is operated by the customer for transmitting data signals concerning the vehicle and the customer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for control of 
automatic refuelling automotive vehicles. European patent application publication No. 418 744 discloses a 
system for control of automatic refuelling an automotive vehicle, 
which system comprises a service panel for receiving data relating 
to the automotive vehicle to be refuelled, a fuel dispenser unit, a 
parking place located between the service panel and the fuel 
dispenser unit, and an induction loop arranged in the parking place 
to detect the presence of an automotive vehicle, which system 
further includes a device for coarsely determining the position of 
the automotive vehicle, means for moving the fill pistol, a near 
field sensor located near the fill pistol and adapted to co-operate 
with a signalling device located near the fill opening of the 
automotive vehicle, and a processing unit for operating the system. Although in the above document an advanced automatic refuelling 
system is presented in that the driver or customer yet maintains 
full control as to the fuelling procedure, some shortcomings remain. 
Always panel handling, including the supply of a credit card, 
outside the vehicle is required. In view of the customer's or 
client's convenience as to safety, possible physical handicap, and 
state of the weather, the way of operating shown is less desirable. Besides the safety aspects mentioned a further aspect has to be 
noticed. Although automatic refuelling simplifies the customer's 
efforts and his direct involvement and interference with respect to 
the refuelling procedure, simultaneously said automation 
substantially reduces the customers power to correct and to 
interrupt the procedure. Furthermore, separate station units, arranged for operating the 
above said console-table and housing filling devices, making up the 
refuelling station as a whole, are necessary. As a further consequence several data providing and data 
communications links are employed, hereby complicating signal  
 
communication processing. Accordingly separate driver actions and 
respective detection operations need to be connected to unified data 
signals for being processed by the processing unit. Thus, separate 
signal pick up and signal link interruptions are possible failure 
sources. It is therefore an object of the invention to obtain a fully 
integrated system for control of automatic refuelling automotive 
vehicles in that simultaneously full control on the refuelling 
procedure from inside the vehicle is maintained. It is a further
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system for control of automatic refuelling an automotive 
vehicle parked alongside a fuel dispenser unit, which system 

comprises 

(a) communication means which communication means include means for 
operating the communication means arranged in the automotive vehicle 

and an electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver arranged on the 
automotive vehicle, and an electronic circuitry which is connected 

to the electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver, which electronic 
circuitry holds data including fuel pipe and fuel cap position data; 

and 
(b) at the fuel dispenser unit, a processing unit, an 
electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver connected to the 

processing unit, operating control units connected to the processing 
unit for controlling fuel supply operating units and for vehicle 

position determination, fill pipe and fuel cap position 
determination, and a couple of electromagnetic wave receivers 

connected to the operating control unit for the vehicle position 
determination, 
 
wherein when the communication means is activated the 

electromagnetic waves emitted by the electromagnetic wave 
transmitter/receiver on the automotive vehicle are received by both 

the electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver and the couple of 
electromagnetic wave receivers of the fuel dispenser unit. 
System as claimed in claim 1, wherein the electromagnetic wave 
transmitter/receiver on the automotive vehicle and the 

electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver of the fuel dispenser unit 
are transmitters and receivers for infra-red light waves, and 

wherein the couple of electromagnetic wave receivers are receivers 
for infra-red light waves. 
System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the system for 
operating the communication means is a vehicle control means.  

 
System as claimed in any one of the claims 1-3, wherein the 
electromagnetic wave transmitter/receiver of the automotive vehicle 

is arranged in a rear light. 
System as claimed in any one of the claims 1-4, wherein the 
system for operating the communication means is the brake pedal.
