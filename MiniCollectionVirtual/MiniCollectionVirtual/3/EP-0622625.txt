<ABSTRACT>
Air quality in a geographic area is monitored through an 
integrated network (10) of a central site (80) for receiving 

telemetrically-transmitted air-content data and multiple air-content 
sensors (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70) distributed throughout 

the geographic area. The air-content sensors (20, 30, 40, 50, 
60, 70) telemetrically-transmit air-content data to the central 

information receiving site (80). The distributed sensors (20, 
30, 40, 50, 60, 70) not only monitor air in general but are also 

located at pollutant emission sites such as industrial exhaust 
flues (61), vehicle thoroughfares (51) which are generally 

traveled by exhaust-emitting vehicles, and sites through which 
gaseous substances regularly flow and are likely to escape. The 

location which is the source of telemetrically-transmitted air-content 
data may be identified by encoding the signal (22, 32, 

42, 52, 62, 72) transmitted from the source. Telemetric-transmission 
may be accomplished by satellite (13) link, cellular 

relay, or radio-transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for monitoring air 
quality, and more particularly to an integrated system for real-time 
assessment of air quality. The quality of air greatly affects the sustenance of plant 
and animal life in a geographic area. In particular, air quality 
affects the ability of humans to comfortably live or survive in 
a geographic area. Air quality is affected by the types and 
concentrations of gaseous substances that are present in the 
normal unadulterated mixture of gases that make up air. The 
quality of air at a given instant is a function of pollutants 
present in air and pollutants entering air. It is important to 
monitor air quality to detect any changes for several reasons. 
One reason is that a change in air quality may result in a 
condition that is less than optimum for human habitation of the 
area. In this instance, individuals may experience severe health 
problems in attempting to breathe degraded air or may not be able 
to live if air in the area is breathed over a period of time. 
It is desirable in these instances to issue health warnings or 
alerts. Another reason for monitoring air quality is that a 
change in air quality due to pollutants may be an indication of 
an impending or occurring environmental or man-made disaster. 
For example, gaseous emissions from a volcano may signal an 
impending or occurring eruption. Similarly, an accident at a 
nuclear plant or in a gas pipeline will cause characteristic  
 
gases to enter the air. A problem in monitoring air quality is that it is difficult 
to accurately assess air quality in a geographic area where the 
content of the air frequently changes due to pollutants 
periodically or regularly entering the air. Likely emitters of 
gaseous pollutants are vehicle exhausts, industrial flues, and 
mechanical members such as flanges and valves of pipelines which 
restrain or direct the flow of gaseous substances. It is an object of the invention to provide a means for 
analyzing air-quality on a continuous, real-time basis. It is a further object of the invention to provide a means 
for real-time analysis of air quality by integrating air-quality 
information from multiple monitoring sites including pollutant 
emission sites. According to a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention, air quality in a geographic area is monitored through 
an integrated network of a central site for receiving 
telemetrically-transmitted air-content data and multiple air-content 
sensors distributed throughout the geographic
