<ABSTRACT>
A needle holder assembly (10) having a sleeve (30) that slidably 
receives 

a needle holder (20) 
having a needle assembly (5) attached thereto. After the need holder 

assembly (10) has been used 
to collect a sample of body fluid, the needle holder (20) is slid from 

its initial retracted position 
to a permanently locked extended position. In the extended position 

the used needle (15) is 
contained within the sleeve (30) of the assembly (10) and can be 

disposed of. 
The assembly (10) of the 

present invention includes a mechanism for smoothly releasing the 
needle holder (20) from the 

retracted position, an improved mechanism for permanently and securely 
locking the needle 

holder (20) in the extended position, and a body fluid collection 
channel (33) 

around the distal end of 
the sleeve that prevents body fluid from splattering from the distal 

end of the assembly (10), 
when the sleeve  (30) is locked in the needle holder (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved needle holder assembly and,
more particularly, a needle holder assembly having a release mechanism for
smoothly releasing the needle holder from a retracted position to permit the needle
holder to slide within a sleeve to an extended position at which the holder is
permanently locked for disposal by an improved locking mechanism.A needle holder assembly is commonly used in hospitals and doctors
offices to aid in drawing body fluid, e.g., blood, from a patient for diagnostic
testing and other procedures. Needle holder assemblies primarily consist of a
hollow cylinder inner tube body or needle holder that holds a standard double-ended
hollow needle at its distal end with one end of the needle extending into the tube
and the other end extending out of the tube for piercing the patient's skin extending.
The tube body is shaped to receive an evacuated collection tube having a piercable
closure so that the closure is pierced by the internal end of the needle and body fluid
is drawn by the vacuum from the patient into the collection tube. An example of a 
piercable closure that is currently being used to seal evacuated tubes is the
HEMOGARD™ Closure for use on the VACUTAINER Brand tube from Becton,
Dickinson and Company. The HEMOGARD™ Closure is basically a rubber stopper
covered by a plastic shield, however, a more detailed description of the closure is
contained in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,741,446 (Miller) and 4,991,104 (Miller), both of
which are assigned to Becton, Dickinson and Company.Needle holder assemblies have also been made having an outer safety
shield or sleeve that slidably receives the hollow cylinder inner tube, described
above, the sleeve being slightly larger in diameter than the inner tube which permits
the inner tube to slide within the sleeve from a retracted position to an extended
position. When the inner tube is in the retracted position, the needle extends out of
an opening in the distal end of the sleeve and when the inner tube is in the extended
position, the needle is contained within and surrounded by the sleeve so that the
needle holder assembly can be disposed of. Such needle holder assemblies are very
useful and valuable since they minimize the chance of accidental needle sticks
occurring after the assembly has been disposed of by surrounding the sharp point of
the used needle.A needle holder assembly of the type described above is shown in U.S.
Patent No. 4,923,445 (Ryan). The Ryan assembly includes a hollow cylindrical
inner tube body

<CLAIMS>
A needle holder assembly (10) comprising:

a sleeve (30) having a main portion with an opening at a proximal end (40) of
said sleeve (30) and a neck portion (32) at a distal end of said sleeve (30) that is

connected to said main portion;
a needle holder (20) slidably received within said sleeve (30) through said
opening for movement from a retracted position where a needle held in said needle

holder (20) extends through said neck portion (32) of said sleeve (30), to an extended
position where the needle is contained within said sleeve (30);
a locking mechanism that permanently and securely locks the needle holder (20)
to the sleeve (30) at the extended position; and
means for smoothly releasing said needle holder (20) from said retracted
position and permitting said needle holder (20) to slide towards said extended position;

characterised in that the locking mechanism includes

a segmented annular projection (36) having a plurality of angled free-standing
flexible fingers (36) that extend from an interior wall (31) of the sleeve (30);

and
a groove (26) at the distal end of the needle holder (20) for receiving
said plurality of flexible fingers (36) when the needle holder (20) is in the extended

position; the flexible fingers (36) expanding in the groove (26) when the needle holder
(20) is moved and thereby provide permanent and secure mating and locking with the

groove to prevent any axial movement of the holder (20) in the sleeve (30).
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 1, wherein said means for
releasing said needle holder (20) from said retracted position is activated in response to

rotation of said needle holder (20) within said sleeve (30). 
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 1, wherein said means for
releasing said needle holder (20) from said retracted position includes a plurality of

threads extending from an interior wall of said sleeve (30) that mate with said needle
holder (20), whereby said needle holder (20) is released from said retracted position as

said needle holder (20) is rotated relative to said sleeve (30).
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 1, wherein:

said sleeve (30) further includes a shoulder (34) connecting said main portion to
said neck portion (32);
said needle holder (20) further includes a shoulder (24) at said distal end that
contacts said sleeve shoulder (34) when said needle holder (20) is in said retracted

position to prevent said needle holder (20) from sliding in a distal direction with said
sleeve (30); and
said releasing means securely mates with said needle holder (20) to prevent said
needle holder (20) from sliding in a proximal direction within said sleeve (30).
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 1, further comprising means
for supporting said needle holder (20) within said sleeve (30) about said proximal end.
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 5, wherein said supporting
means includes an annular support (38) extending from said proximal end of said sleeve

(30) and contacting said needle holder (20).
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 1, further comprising means
for capturing liquid within said neck portion (32) to prevent the liquid from splattering

out of said sleeve (30).
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 7, wherein said means for
capturing liquid within said neck portion (32) comprises an annular channel (33)

surrounding an opening at said distal end of said neck portion (32) on said sleeve (30) 
so to prevent the liquid from splattering out of said sleeve (30) when said needle holder

(20) is locked in said extended position.
A needle holder assembly (10) according to Claim 8, wherein said channel has a
shape of to half a hollow toroid.
