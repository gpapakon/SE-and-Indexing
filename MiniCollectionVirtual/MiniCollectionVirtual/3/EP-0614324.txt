<ABSTRACT>
An assembly/disassembly system is comprised of a cell assembly 
and a cell disassembly, each assembly having one buffer memory (12, 

910) with its memory area logically divided into a plurality of data 
areas (banks). The cell assembly receives TDM data to assemble ATM 

cells by storing the TDM data into the respective banks according 
to the virtual channels. When one of said banks stores the TDM data 

in the payload length of an ATM cell, an new bank (unused bank) is 
specified to store the TDM data successively. An ATM cell is formed 

by using the data read out from the bank where the TDM data is 
stored in the payload length of an ATM cell. The cell disassembly 

receives ATM cells from the ATM highway (5) to disassemble the ATM 
cells into TDM data by using the buffer memory. The payload of a 

received cell is stored into an unused bank of the buffer memory. 
A chain of the bank addresses each storing the payload of the 

received ATM cell is formed for each virtual channel of received ATM 
cells. According to a bank address read out from the chain 

corresponding to each channel of the TDM highway (11), the data as 
the TDM data is read out from the buffer memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to assembly/disassembly of ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) cells and, in particular, to a
multiprocessing system for assembling/disassembling ATM cells in
order to connect an ATM network system to a network system of other
information transfer mode.B-ISDN (Broad band-Integrated Service Digital Network) is a
network which is capable of dealing with transfer of various types
of information contemplated in the future such as full motion
pictures, high-definite images or large capacity file, and has been
vigorously researched and developed in the world. For such a B-ISDN,
ATM is currently recognized to be more suitable than the
conventional STM (Synchronous Transfer Mode).ATM is an information transfer mode where information to be
transmitted is loaded into fixed length cells each comprising a
header and an information field which are multiplexed together to
transfer over transmission lines. These fixed length cells are
hereinafter referred to as ATM cells. ATM allows the network system
to obtain an effective use of the transmission lines as well as a
flexibility such that information transfer can be made regardless
of information type such as sound and image. In order to achieve an integrated service by the ATM network,
however, it is necessary to connect the ATM network to the existing
communication network and, to such an end, a system for cell
assembly/disassembly becomes indispensable. Since cell
assembly/disassembly is made for each call, a high speed and large
multiplexing capability is necessary to the system for cell
assembly/disassembly.A conventional system is hereinafter described, taking the cell
assembly/disassembly, by way of example, which is performed between
fixed bit rate data on an N-channel time division multiplex (TDM)
data highway and ATM cells on the ATM highway.It should be noted that the term "virtual channel" or "VC" is
hereinafter defined by VPI (Virtual Path Identifier) and VCI
(Virtual Channel Identifier).First, a cell assembly apparatus, which assembles ATM cells
from the TDM data, is provided with N buffer memories and N memory
controllers corresponding to the N channels, respectively. Upon
receipt of the TDM data, it is allocated to the respective buffer
memories according to their channels where the respective cells are
individually assembled. On completion of the assembly of a cell,
the cell is read out from the buffer memory and is transmitted to
the ATM highway as an ATM cell.A cell disassembly apparatus, which disassembles ATM cells into

A multiprocessing system for disassembling asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) cells into multiplex data on a time division

multiplex transmission line (11) having a plurality of channels,

an unused bank address memory (16) for retaining the 
addresses of the banks which are not used for cell disassembly;

bank address from/onto said unused bank address memory; and
data writing means (102) for writing the payload data of an
received ATM cell onto said buffer memory according to the unused

bank address.

said unused bank address memory is adapted to retain said unused

bank addresses in a queue, and said memory control means is
