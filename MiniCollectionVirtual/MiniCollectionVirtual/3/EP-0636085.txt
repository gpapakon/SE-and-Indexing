The present application is related to commonly-owned, 
co-pending patent applications entitled 
HELICOPTER NOISE REDUCTION THROUGH GEARING 
MODIFICATIONS (S-4591), filed March 9, 1992, and 
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSMISSION GEARBOX NOISE 
CONTROL UTILIZING LOCALIZED OIL COOLING/HEATING (S-4463), 
filed March 9, 1992. The present invention is directed to systems for 
reducing helicopter interior noise levels resulting 
from airframe vibrations, and more particularly, to 
an active noise control (ANC) system that is 
operative, utilizing optimally combined sensors and 
force actuators mounted on interface structural 
members that are mechanically stiffened in their 
entirety or only at specific localized segments, to 
nullify high frequency vibrations emanating from the 
helicopter main transmission gearbox at the 
gearbox/airframe interface, thereby providing a 
significant reduction in interior noise levels. The 
ANC system of the present invention has particular 
utility in abating high frequency vibrations 
emanating from the main transmission gearbox of S-76® 
helicopters (S-76 is a registered trademark of the 
Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies 
Corporation).  
 Interior noise control is a primary concern in 
the operation of helicopters. While there are 
numerous sources of noise-generating vibrations 
occurring in an operating helicopter, such as the 
main rotor assembly, the main transmission, the 
engines, the tail rotor assembly, the hydraulic 
system, aerodynamic forces, etc., the vibrations 
emanating from the main rotor assembly and the main 
transmission have the most pronounced effect on 
helicopter interior noise levels, i.e., in the 
cockpit and/or cabin. The operation of the main rotor assembly during 
forward flight of the helicopter results in the 
generation of "low frequency" vibrations at the blade 
passing frequency (and harmonics thereof). The blade 
passing frequency is equal to the product of the 
number of main rotor blades and the rotational speed 
of the rotor. For example, the main rotor assembly 
of the BLACK HAWK® helicopter (BLACK HAWK is a 
registered trademark of Sikorsky Aircraft), which has 
four main rotor blades, has a blade passing frequency 
of approximately 17 Hz. Similarly, the S-76® 
helicopter has a blade passing frequency of 
approximately 19 Hz. The operation of the main transmission of the 
helicopter, in contrast, results in the generation of 
"high frequency" vibrations. For example, Sikorsky 
helicopters of the S-76® series, e.g., S-76A,
