<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for determining the degree of coupling of a variable transmission system is described which exhibits a differential electrical transmission characteristic. This can be a differential transformer. An oscillator feeding the input of the transmission circuit comprises a series circuit of an integrator and a comparator, the output of the comparator being connected to the input of the transmission circuit. The output of the comparator is also connected via an adder, together with the output of the transmission circuit, to the input of the integrator. An evaluation and indicating circuit comprises a counter arrangement, or a computer, measuring the frequency or the period of the oscillator.

a) the transmission system (10) has a differential electrical

calculated from circuit parameters or have been measured in a 

preceding or cyclical calibration operation, the degree of coupling
