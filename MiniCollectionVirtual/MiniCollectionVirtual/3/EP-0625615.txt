<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes an apparatus for removing blockage in 
a tubular member with a plunger (10) having a hollow channel and flexible 

member. 
The drain plunger comprises a pipe terminating at one end with a cap and the 

other end a flexible member for exerting pressure on the stagnant fluid in the 
tubular member. Preferably, the flexible member has a cross sectional area 

corresponding to the inner diameter of the tubular member. In simplest 
implementation of the present invention, the flexible member is a flexible 

disk or 
washer. When the user exerts pressure on the column of stagnant fluids with 

the plunger in the tubular member, the compressed air in the hollow channel 
assists the user in reversing the direction of the plunger and dislodging the 

plumbing traps in a few reciprocating strokes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for clearing blockages in a 
tubular member, and in particular to a plunger for removing plumbing traps in a 
drain pipe. A variety of devices are known for clearing blockages in drain pipes. For 
instance, the ubiquitous suction cup has been in existence for some time to 
perform this function. Lately, chemicals are employed to dissolve the solid 
particles that are lodged in the inaccessible portion of a pipe. While the suction 
cup is effective for minor blockages, the chemical solutions tend to be corrosive.  The present invention describes an apparatus for removing blockage in a 
tubular member with a plunger having a hollow channel and flexible member. 
The drain plunger comprises a pipe terminating at one end with a cap and the 
other end a flexible member for exerting pressure on the stagnant fluid in the 
tubular member. Preferably, the flexible member has a cross sectional area 
corresponding to the inner diameter of the tubular member. In simplest 
implementation of the present invention, the flexible member is a flexible disk or 
washer. When the user exerts pressure on the column of stagnant fluids with 
the plunger in the tubular member, the compressed air in the hollow channel 
assists the user in reversing the direction of the plunger and dislodging the 
plumbing traps in a few reciprocating strokes.  Fig. 1A is a perspective view of one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 1B is an exploded perspective view of the present invention according to 
Fig. 1A and shows the various components of the drain plunger. Fig. 1C is a side elevational view of the present invention. Fig. 1D is a cross sectional elevational view of the present invention according 
to Fig. 1C. Figs 2A - 2D are cross section views of the present invention being inserted in a 
section of a blocked gulley to remove plumbing traps lodged within the gulley.  Fig 1A is a perspective view of one embodiment of the present invention 
10. Fig. 1B is a exploded perspective view of the present invention according 
to 
Fig. 1A. In Fig. 1B, the plunger 10 comprises a tubular member 15, a flexible 
member 30 and a cap 50. It should be understood by one skilled in the art that 
the tubular member 15 refers to any cylindrical object having at least a hollow 
channel 20 (not shown). Preferably, the tubular member 15 is a pipe made of a 
lightweight but sturdy material. In the preferred embodiment of the present 
invention, the tubular member is a general purpose drain pipe. Referring

<CLAIMS>
A device for removing blockages in a first tubular member, said 
member having at least one opening through which said device may be 

inserted, said device comprising 
   a second tubular member having an outer diameter smaller 

than the inner diameter of said first tubular member; 
   a cap sealing one end of said second tubular member such 

only one end of the hollow interior of said second tubular member is 
exposed; 

   a flexible member coupled concentrically to the other end of 
said second tubular member without obstructing the opening of said hollow 

interior for exerting a pressure on the fluid lodged within the interior of said first 
tubular member. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said flexible member has 
a cross sectional area substantially similar to that of that of the inner diameter of 

said first tubular member. 
The device according to claim 2 wherein said flexible member is a 
flexible disk or washer. 
The device according to claim 2 wherein said flexible member is a 
balloon. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said second tubular 
member may be extended.
