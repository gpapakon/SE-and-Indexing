<ABSTRACT>
In a construction for automatically milking animals 
in a milk box having a milking robot use is made in the 

milking robot of carriers for teat cups, which carriers are 
connected capably of being moved to under the animals to be 

milked to four-bar linkages, of which one of the sides is 
adjustable in the longitudinal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a
milk box having a milking robot with at least one arm
construction with a carrier of a teat cup and a second four-bar
linkage with which the carrier can be moved in the upward
direction.Such a construction is known from EP-A-0 313 109.
In order to position the teat cups in a horizontal plane,
each teat cup can rotate around an associated vertical hinge
pin. Consequently the teat cups can be positioned in the
cycle.So as to allow the carrier of a teat cup to be
placed and moved under the animal in an advantageous manner,
more in particular to enable transverse motions by means of
the carrier, whereby coupling of the teat cups to the teats
is advantageously influenced, the respective carrier of a
teat cup is attached, according to the invention,
to a first four-bar linkage,
of which one arm is adjustable and which first four-bar
linkage is active in a predominantly horizontal plane, while
furthermore there is provided second four-bar linkage with
which the carrier can be moved in the upward direction. More
in particular, the carrier may be attached to a four-bar
linkage near the box wall, as here there is sufficient room
for accommodating such a structure. The construction can be
provided near the box wall with adjusting devices comprising
four-bar linkages, the devices being disposed such that the
teat cups are simultaneously couplable to the four teats of
an animal to be milked. Near the box wall there is sufficient
room for accommodating four adjusting devices comprising
four-bar linkages, whilst this creates the possibility of
coupling the teat cups at the same time, so that coupling the
teat cups can be effected in a particularly fast manner. The
four-bar linkages are disposed such that two of these
structures are located near each of the two side walls of the 
milk box. In an advantageous arrangement, the four-bar
linkages accommodated near a side wall of the milk box may
have been disposed at the exterior side, at the front and
rear sides of the milk box. Since a four-bar linkage serves
as a carrier of a teat cup and it must be possible to move
this cup from the side wall of the box to under a relevant
teat, such a four-bar linkage will preferably be active in a
predominantly horizontal plane. In addition, the four-bar
linkage can be connected capably of upward motion to a
rigidly disposed frame portion. More in particular, via a
second four-bar linkage the said first four-bar linkage can
be

A construction for automatically milking animals,
such as cows, comprising a milk box (3) having a milking

robot with at least one robot arm construction (19) with a
carrier (23) of a teat cup (26) and a second four-bar linkage

(22) with which the carrier (23) can be moved in the upward
direction, characterized in that the carrier (23) is attached

to a first four-bar linkage (24), of which one arm (25) is
adjustable and which first four-bar linkage (24) is active in

a predominantly horizontal plane.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the carrier (25) is attached to the first four-bar

linkage (24) near the box wall.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that near the box wall it

is provided with adjusting devices which comprise first and
second four-bar linkages (22, 24) and are arranged such that

the teat cups (26) are simultaneously couplable to the four
teats of an animal to be milked.
A construction as claimed in claim 3, characterized
in that near each of the two side walls of the milk box (3)

there are disposed two facing first four-bar linkages (24).
A construction as claimed in claim 4, characterized
in that the first four-bar linkages (24) located near one

side wall of the milk box are attached to the exterior side,
at the front and rear side of the milk box.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the second four-bar

linkage (22) is connected with the said first four-bar
linkage (24) and is capably of upward motion to a frame

portion (20) located near the box wall.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the first and second

four-bar linkages (22, 24) are movable with the aid of a 
pneumatic operating cylinder.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the carrier (23) of a

teat cup (26) extends predominantly linearly and is obliquely
and rearwardly movable between a front and hind leg of an

animal to be milked to under a relevant teat of the animal.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it includes teat cups

(26) to which milk tubes (27) are connected which are
separately accommodated capably of sliding in or along

predominantly linearly extending carriers (23) of the teat
cups (26).
A construction as claimed in claim 9, characterized
in that a teat cup (26) can be pulled up against the end of a

carrier (33) with the aid of an operating cylinder.
A construction as claimed in claim 10,
characterized in that the operating cylinder acts on the milk

tube.
A construction as claimed in claim 10,
characterized in that the operating cylinder acts on a

separate flexible element, such as a cable, by means of which
