<ABSTRACT>
A personal lubricant composition containing an 
antiviral, alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol spermicide, a 

water soluble polymer gel matrix and a solubilizer which 
permits the spermicide to be compatible with the gel 

matrix. Preferably, a polyethoxylated compound such as 
polyethoxylated castor oil may be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricating composition 
containing a spermicidal/anti-viral component. More 
particularly, it relates to a spermicidal/anti-viral 
sexual lubricant composition which is stable and extremely 
lubricious. For many years, women have used spermicidal products, 
such as nonoxynol-9, to prevent unwanted pregnancies. 
These products have been applied in formulations such as 
jellies, creams and foams. More recently, it has been 
found that nonoxynol-9 and its related spermicides can be 
effective in combatting sexually transmitted diseases 
caused by certain viruses, including Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). [See, for example, Stone et 
al., Am J. Obstet. Gynecol., Vol. 155, p. 180 (1986); 
Voeller, Lancet, 1 (8490), 1153 (1986); and Louv et al., 
J. Infect. Dis., Vol. 158, 518 (1988)]. Although there are currently vaginal cream and jelly 
products intended for preventing pregnancies which are 
commercially available, the lubricating and spreading 
properties of these products are relatively poor. They 
can be grainy and are not capable of moisturizing the 
vagina, and, therefore, cause some discomfort in use. 
Furthermore, the main objective of these creams and 
jellies is to prevent pregnancy, rather than necessarily 
to function as a personal lubricant. It has been suggested that anti-viral agents such as 
zinc or spermicides may be added to sexual lubricants in  
 
order to provides personal lubrication (European Patent 
Application 0 402 078, Kelly, published December 12, 
1990). However, the mere addition of a spermicide such as 
nonoxynol-9 to an existing polymer matrix can cause 
physical reactions which may destroy the polymer matrix 
and will not afford an effective personal lubricant. Personal, or vaginal lubricants such as K-Y· brand 
lubricating Jelly, which contain hydroxyethylcellulose as 
a base, are known to afford vaginal moisturization and 
lubrication, as set forth in copending U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/921,819. However, the addition 
of nonoxynol-9 or related spermicides to a 
hydroxyethylcellulose gel system tends to cause the 
hydroxyethylcellulose gel system to collapse. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to 
provide a composition for lubricating and moisturizing the 
vagina and/or body cavities. It is a further object of this invention to provide 
a spermicidal composition that has excellent moisturizing 
and lubricating properties. Yet another object of this invention is to provide an 
antiviral composition that has
