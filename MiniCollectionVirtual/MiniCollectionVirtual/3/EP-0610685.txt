<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for making a pressure-sealed connection of thin-walled articles made of metal, in particular plate-shaped metal sheets, such as heat-exchanger plates, which are provided with an enamel layer (3, 8) at least on one side as corrosion protection. In order to obtain a pressure-sealed and self-retaining connection of the articles to be connected, which requires no joining fillers or joining agents or no subsequent treatment of the joint, it is proposed that the articles to be connected to one another be correctly positioned and that they be pressed against one another at least at the joining surfaces (4) and heated in such a way that the enamel layer (3, 8) located between the joining surfaces (4) is changed into a pasty state and produces a self-retaining connection of the articles.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the pressure-tight connection of 
thin-walled objects made of metal, in particular plate-shaped 

metal sheets, such as heat-exchanger plates, which 
are provided at least on one side with a layer of enamel 

as an anti-corrosion measure, characterized in that the 
objects which are to be connected to one another are 

placed in the correct position and are pressed against 
each other at least at the joint surfaces (4) and heated 

such that the layer of enamel (3, 8) situated between the 
joint surfaces (4) changes into a pasty state and brings 

about a material-to-material connection of the objects. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the application of heat and pressure takes place in 

a furnace under standard atmosphere. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the heat is generated by inductive heating of the 

metallic base material. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the inductive heating takes place exclusively in the 

region of the joint surfaces (4).
