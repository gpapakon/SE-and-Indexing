<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a resin for powder coatings for use as a top coat in the automotive industry. The invention also concerns top-coated automotive substrates. The resin is an acrylate polymer with several side chains containing unsaturated groups and the amount of unsaturation in the unsaturated acrylate resin is between 213 and 1400 g per mol unsaturated group. The unsaturated group is a (meth)acrylate ester group, an allyl group, a vinyl group or an anhydride containing unsaturated group. The resin results in powder coatings having properties, which makes them very suitable in the automotive industry, especially for use as clear top coats.

 RESIN FOR POWDER COATINGS FOR USE AS A TOP COAT IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND TOP-COATED AUTOMOTIVE SUBSTRATESThe invention relates to a resin for powder coatings for use as a top coat in the automotive industry. The invention also concerns top-coated automotive substrates.The top coat or finish coat is the coating intended to be the last coat applied in a coating system and is usually applied over a primer, a basecoat or surfaces. The clear top coats which, according to the present state of the art in the automotive industry, are used as a two-component system are solvent-containing paint systems based on acrylate resins cured with isocyanates. In order to meet the requirements regarding the reduction in solvent emissions, so-called high-solids systems are already being used. The only way to reduce solvent emissions still further is to use powder coatings for clear automotive coatings (Lattke, E. "Pulverlack am Auto; Aus der Sicht der Autoindustrie", presented at "Der Pulvertreff '92, January 23, 1992, Mϋnchen"; JOT-Veranstaltungen, pages 1-11).Powder paint systems for automotive top coats must meet the same stringent performance standards set for the solvent-containing systems. These requirements include for instance flow, chemical resistance, gloss and outdoor durability (Kinza, W. "Pulverklarlack fur dieKarosseriebeschichtung", presented at "Die EPS-Praxis 1991, November 25 1991, Bad Neuheim"; Schriftenreihe Praxis-Forum, Fachbrochure Oberflachentechnik 27/91, pages 49-55).It is an object of the present invention to provide a resin which results in these properties at a curing temperature of less than 150°C. The presently available powder resin systems do not satisfy the required combination 

of properties. Some properties can be obtained with systems based on an acid-epoxy curing reaction, but the required combination of good flow, good chemical resistance, high gloss, high scratch resistance, good mechanical properties and good outdoor durability remains a desired but still elusive objective for powder coatings. With systems based on polymers containing hydroxyl groups and curing agents containing blocked isocyanate groups, too, several of the above-mentioned properties can be obtained. However, the usual temperature (above 170°C) at which these systems must be cured is far too high for application as a (clear) topcoat for automotive applications. It is for example elucidated in the article 'PowderCoatings in Europe' by Morandini (Pitture e Vernice 9/88, p. 70), that it is yet always an aim to
