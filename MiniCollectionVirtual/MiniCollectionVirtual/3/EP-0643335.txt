<ABSTRACT>
An image projection system for all surfaces of a three 
dimensional object (7) such as a polyhedron in which direct and 

angle reflected image patterns are projected from 
superpositioned non-overlapping mask patterns (5,8) mounted on 

different levels (3,4) where the separation (S) of the levels is 
related to the size of the object. the apparatus and process 

permits simultaneous photolithographic printing of conduc tors 
on the top and all sides of a cube shaped stack of integrated 

circuit chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the projection of patterned light 
such as images onto the surfaces of three dimensional objects 
and in particular to the projection of patterns for 
lithographical electrical conductor formation purposes on the 
surfaces of solid state electronic apparatus. In producing a three dimensional object, such as a polyhedron 
where it is desirable to provide patterns on different 
surfaces for photoresponsive operations, it would be of 
advantage to produce a pattern on each surface without having 
to reposition the object. A particular illustration is in 
the field of solid state electronic apparatus where the 
wiring, for a plurality of integrated circuit members that 
have been assembled into a stack having an overall polyhedron 
shape, is formed on the surfaces of the polyhedron. The 
standard way in the art of forming such wiring is by the 
separate projection or contact printing, for subsequent 
photolithographic conductor formation of an image of the 
wiring for each individual surface, on that respective 
surface. Where there is a high conductor density and 
interrelationship of conductor patterns from surface to 
surface, the problems of the positioning in registration of 
the surfaces of the polyhedron shaped integrated circuit 
stack for separate photolithographic conductor formation on 
each surface reqiures meticulous attention and adds to cost 
in manufacturing.
 
 
There has been some activity in the electronic apparatus 
field photolithographic accommodation of three dimensional 
features and considerations.
 
In US-A- 5,001,038, in the printed circuit manufacturing 
field, differences in surface level are accommodated by using 
different masks for different levels relative to a reference 
plane.
 
In Japanese Patent document JP-A- 3183115 the considerations 
of flaws in mask patterns in the semiconductor manufacturing 
field is accommodated by superimposing more than one mask in 
an optical path to be projected onto a substrate.
 
It would be of advantage to be able to project an image on 
each surface of a three dimensional object simultaneously and 
without having to reposition the object. The invention is a technique of projecting light patterns for 
such photosensitive reactions as chemical changes, 
photodeposition and ablation.
 
Image projection is provided for all surfaces of a three 
dimensional object through an optical system wherein light 
passes through a mask pattern for each surface,the light 
through the mask patterns is focused on each surface,
