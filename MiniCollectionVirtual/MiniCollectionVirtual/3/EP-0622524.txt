<ABSTRACT>
A system for measuring an excavation position for measuring a position of an underground excavator with high accuracy 
by advantageously utilizing fluctuation errors which are difficult to be removed. The system comprises: a plurality of magnetic 

field generating devices (2) provided at known positions outside the underground excavator; a magnetic field detecting device (3) 
provided in the underground excavator; and a microcomputer (4) connected to the above-described devices (2, 3). The microcomputer 

(4) drives the above-described devices (2, 3) on the basis of an allowable error in displacement, which is specified and input 
to the microcomputer (4) by an operator and outputs an excavation position of the underground excavator (1) within a scope of 

the aforesaid allowable error. As for the aforesaid allowable error to be specified and input, a magnetic field generating device 
previously selected by the operator or an allowable error previously selected by the operator will serve the purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for measuring an 
excavation position and, in particular, to a system for 
measuring a position of an underground excavator with high 
accuracy on the basis of an allowable error in displacement. The present inventors have proposed various devices 
and methods for measuring excavation position of an 
underground excavator (See, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 245690/1990, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 87612/1991, 
Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58371-58384/1990 and 59201-59220/1991). 
Those disclosed therein are for measuring the 
excavation position of an underground excavator by using 
techniques applying magnetic fields or radar. Considering the outline of a method using magnetic 
fields, at least one magnetic field generating device is 
provided outside the underground excavator. For example, the 
magnetic field generating device(s) may be provided within a 
vertical shaft ahead of the underground excavator, in front 
of the underground excavator opposed thereto, or on a plane 
along an excavation plan line. A magnetic field detecting 
device is provided in the underground excavator to detect 
strength of the magnetic field generated by the magnetic  
 
field generating device. The relative position between the 
magnetic field generating device and the magnetic field 
detecting device is measured according to the strength of the 
detected magnetic field. The magnetic field generating device is located at a 
known position relative to the excavation plan line while the 
magnetic field detecting device is also located at a known 
position in the underground excavator. Accordingly, the 
excavation position of the underground excavator can be 
measured by means of measuring the relative position of these 
devices. The above mentioned conventional art is basically for 
measuring an actual excavation position relative to the 
excavation plan line, i.e., an absolute value of the 
displacement, which results in a value with high accuracy to 
some extent. However, this method is disadvantageous in that 
the magnitude of errors is unknown. The errors can be divided into equipment errors and 
fluctuation errors. It is possible to overcome a problem of 
the equipment errors by means of improving performance of the 
equipment used. However, the fluctuation errors are 
difficult to be removed because it depends on various 
external factors. More particularly, the fluctuation error 
may be caused as a result of permeability change related to 
divergent underground
