<ABSTRACT>
A device for operating an electrically heatable catalytic converter (2) with a circuit designed for an electric power of some 0.5 to 10 kW, comprising a current source (6), a power switch (20), an electrically heatable catalytic converter (2) and electric leads (21, 22, 61, 62). Here the power switch (20) is the shared regulator and the catalytic converter (2) is the shared regulating path of at least two different control circuits, the shared regulating value is the temperature in the catalytic converter (2). Control electronics arranged in an electronic unit (5) belong to the various regulating circuits. The electronic unit (5) contains means for checking the regulating circuits and selecting a reliable one. It is possible in this way to compensate for the breakdown of individual components of a regulating circuit by switching over to another without any drawbacks concerning the availability of the motor vehicle and compliance with exhaust gas regulations.

A method of operating an electrically heatable catalytic

downstream of an internal combustion engine (3) with electronic engine 
control (4), wherein the catalytic converter (2) can be supplied with an 

electric current (I) by way of an electronic regulating means (5) and a 
power switch (20) and is to be brought to a minimum temperature required

a) the temperature of the catalytic converter (2) is a regulating 
parameter of at least two different regulating circuits;

power switch (20) is below a minimum value or above a maximum value. 
A method according to claim 8 characterised in that the fact 
that the electrical heating is taken out of operation triggers a 

malfunction message and/or still permits only limited driving operation
