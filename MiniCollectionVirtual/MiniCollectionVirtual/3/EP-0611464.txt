<DESCRIPTION>
 SILICON NEURONThe present invention relates to an electronic instantiation of a biological neuron and, in particular, to an integrated circuit that emulates a biological neuron in real-time (or faster) .It is well known that biological neurons occurring in nervous systems of animals are cells delimited by an enclosing cell membrane that in its various regions is recognised as the cell body (or εoma) , a number of branching dendrites and an axon. The computational properties of the neurons are intimately linked to the controlled flow of ions across the cell membrane and the subseguent flow of ions within the cell. The dendrites collect information from axons of other neurons, via synapses (or contacts) between the dendrites and axons, and pass the information to the cell body. Each neuron is in contact with thousands of other neurons via the dendrite/axon interactions. The dendrites pass the collected information to the cell body. In its resting or polarized state, the inside of a region of membrane fluctuates about a voltage of approximately -70mV with respect to the outside of the membrane. The voltage fluctuation is due to the continual flux of various ions, in particular sodium and potassium ions, into and out of the cell via membrane conductances. These ionic conductances of the cell membrane are voltage- ion- and ligand-sensitive. These ionic conductances are responsive to the state of the local membrane and in turn affect the state of the local membrane. For example, some regions of membrane contain voltage-sensitive conductances that act to amplify the current flowing across the membrane. This current propagates from the local region to nearby regions of membrane affecting its polarization. The most extensively studied example of this phenomenon is the generation of an action potential.If the stimuli fed by the dendrites to the cell body are such that the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the membrane depolarizes past a threshold of 

 approximately -50mV, an avalanche effect occurs as more an more positively charged ions enter the membrane. Thi results in the voltage of the inside of the membran shifting past zero to approximately +50mV. As this occurs an action potential (nerve impulse) is initiated, whic lasts about 1 millisecond.Figure la shows an intrasomatic current injection int a neuron and Figure lb shows the resulting change i membrane potential of the neuron. As can be seen, if a sub threshold current stimulus of 0.20nA (broken line) i entered, a simple charging
