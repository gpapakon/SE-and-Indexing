<ABSTRACT>
The 'SIAMESE' Electronic Post Process is a method of 
achieving aesthetically superior enveloping without 

sacrificing any of the efficacy of the basic Electronic 
Post paradigm. SIAMESE Electronic Post can meanwhile 

produce mail pieces that are indistinguishable from 
professional correspondence initiated on a personal basis. 

This means that regular, non-window, high quality paper 
stock envelopes with aesthetic addressing are produced. 

The process consists in joining the envelope and content 
objects into one 'Siamese' object 100 when the Electronic 

Post mailing is being composed. When this Siamese object 
100 goes through an AFP printer 200, the address is 

imprinted on an envelope sub-object 110 of the Siamese 
object 100 while concurrently the text is printed on a 

content sub-object 120. From printer 200, the Siamese 
object 100 enters a splitting stage 300 where the envelope 

sub-object and the content sub-object 120 are separated. 
The envelope sub-object 110 is automatically cut, folded, 

assembled integral to the splitting stage 300 and the 
content sub-object 120 inserted. The envelope is then 

sealed as a unit 400 and enters the inbound distribution 
phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of electronic distribution of mail by 
creating a transmittal object that can be enveloped using the Electronic Post 
process while maintaining the degree of synchronization and having the material 
properties that allow fluorescent bar coding (bar/no-bar) with only the direct 
use of black ink (non-fluorescent) high-speed printing. Every year, worldwide, approximately 300 billion mail pieces are processed. 
In revenue this creates a cash flow of about $150billion; yet nearly 80% of post 
offices run at a deficit. The missing piece of the economic equation is of course 
that mail processing is labor and transportation intensive - two expensive 
commodities. A mail piece can have as many as 5 sort passes and 4 transits 
before its delivery. If the sortation passes are performed by hand, each pass 
costs about $14/thousand envelopes. If automated, the cost drops to roughly 
$2/thousand envelopes. Hence a very persuasive case exists for automation so envelopes can be machine 
sorted. This process is driven either by OCR devices that image scan the 
face of the envelope and intelligently determine sortation information, or via 
large volume mailers that print a sortation bar code which is machine readable 
on the face of an envelope when the address field is printed. This latter process 
is called pre-bar coding. In certain circumstances, pre-bar coding can make a 
major impact on mail flow. Such letters can be sent directly to the relatively 
inexpensive and numerous bar code sort machines instead of requiring OCR 
processing, which is a more limited and expensive resource. The preceding makes no impact on travel time and transit cost. Most recently 
this vestige of mail processing cost (and delay) has been very effectively addressed 
by a new technology called Electronic Post. The Electronic Post (see FIGURE 3) paradigm assumes receipt of an address 
list and text from a large volume mailer (LVM). Instead of the mailer printing  
 
out the text, enveloping and addressing the mailing; the LVM sends the machine 
readable text and address list to Electronic Post. Electronic Post electronically 
transmits the subject text and corresponding address list to the 
respective destination sort centers. At each destination, the mail pieces for 
delivery from that center are printed out, enveloped and addressed. By this 
means, the major travel time and cost factors in mail processing are eliminated. While Electronic Post represents a revolutionary change in the dynamics of

<CLAIMS>
Improvement over Electronic Post process characterized in that it comprises: 

having an envelope sub-object (500) in an Electronic Post process come preprinted 
with a fluorescent strip (510), and 
having an AFP printer (520) create a bar/no-bar encoding by overprinting 
the florescent strip wherever a "no bar" should be, whereby when scanned by 

a bar code reader (530), the effect of the opaqued areas between bars is the 
same as the traditional "no bar" blank area.
