<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an exterior rearview mirror for a motor vehicle, which mirror is used for observing the area located behind the vehicle. The exterior rearview mirror comprises a foot part which is fixed to the bodywork and on which there is arranged, in an articulated manner, a mirror carrier which, being capable of swivelling freely around the upright articulation pin essentially parallel to the mirror plane, can be advanced towards, and moved away from the vehicle bodywork. The exterior rearview mirror has an electric-motor drive device which exhibits a reduction gear mechanism and is intended for producing the swivelling movement of the mirror carrier, which is in operative connection with the drive device via coupling means which can be brought out of contact in the event of a force acting on the mirror carrier from the outside to effect one of the swivelling movements, the articulation pin, designed as a bolt-like component, penetrating a supporting element, connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the component, as well as the foot part and the extension, and a gear wheel being mounted freely rotatably on that side of the extension which is directed away from the foot part, the toothing arrangement of said gear wheel meshing with a counter-toothing arrangement which is driven by an electric drive motor arranged on the extension. In order that, after an enforced safety swivelling movement which is effected from the outside and takes place in a different plane than the normally intended electric-motor swivelling movement, the rearview mirror can move into its basic position again merely by virtue of the actuation of the drive device, there is arranged, on that end side of the gear wheel which is directed away from the extension, a ring which is penetrated by the component, is connected in a rotationally fixed manner thereto, is pressed against the gear wheel by a pre-stressed means and exhibits at least one carry-along protrusion which fits into a carry-along depression in the gear wheel.
