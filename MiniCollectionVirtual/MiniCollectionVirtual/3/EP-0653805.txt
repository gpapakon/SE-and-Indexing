least one flat conductor of a flexible conductor film with at least 

a conductor lead wire, said contact strip terminal comprising a 
strip-type base part (2) of electrically conducting material and at 

least two groups of teeth (5) projecting outwards relative to a 
surface of said base part (2) for contacting at least one flexible 

conductor of said flexible conductor film, wherein each tooth (5) 
has a sharp pointed end (9) and projects over its total length 

mainly at a right angle away from said surface of said base part 
(2), the contact strip terminal further comprising an edge clip 

connector for connecting the terminal with contact faces of one or 
both surfaces near an edge of a substrate, the edge clip connector 

comprising a stem strip (34) and a clip contact (35) in the form of 
a closed flat longitudinal loop strip which at one end passes into 

the stem strip (34) and which is bent at the other end backwards 
about a transverse axis (38) of said flat loop, so that the legs 

(36, 37) formed by the two halves of said loop come to rest adjacent 
to each other and together define an approximately U-shaped 

clip opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a divisional patent application of European Patent 
Application 87200611.9 (EP-A-243 998). The present invention relates to a contact strip terminal for 
electrically interconnecting at least one flat conductor of a flexible 
conductor film with at least a conductor lead wire, said contact 
strip terminal comprising a strip-type base part of electrically 
conducting material and at least two groups of teeth projecting 
outwards relative to a surface of said base part for contacting 
at least one flexible conductor of said flexible conductor film, in 
which each group of teeth consists of four pointed triangular 
teeth, the base of each triangle mainly coinciding with the surface 
of said base part, said groups of teeth being placed within the 
periphery of the strip-type base part, so that the base line of the 
teeth of each group lies on a simple closed contour, wherein each 
tooth has a sharp pointed end and projects over its total length 
mainly at a right angle away from said surface of said base part. A contact strip terminal of this type is known from US Patent 
Specification 3,197,729. Flat electrical cables such as ribbon cable or flexible conductor 
film are generally known and have been in use for several 
years now, principally for connection purposes. The term "flexible 
conductor film" is generally used for a polyester film serving as a 
carrier, with a copper layer applied thereto, which is etched to 
form a combination of several parallel conducting strips or a 
printed circuit board. Over the etched copper it is also possible 
to apply one or more electrically insulating flexible protection 
layers, with the object of protecting the conducting strips against 
undesired contacting, damage, oxidation through the effects of 
damp, etc. The use of flexible conductor film as wiring for electrical 
circuits, particularly in automobile technology, is reaching ever-increasing 
proportions. Flexible conductor film permits, on the one  
 
hand, a saving of space and weight compared with other wiring techniques 
and, on the other, a considerable simplification of the 
generally complex wiring to electrical instruments, lighting and 
electronic components. In practice, it is therefore necessary to be able to produce 
interconnections in a simple manner at any desired points on the 
film for the purpose of accommodating electrical components (resistors, 
capacitors, diodes, etc.) on the flexible conductor film, but 
also in order to connect the conductors of one flexible conductor 
film in a

Contact strip terminal for electrically interconnecting at 
least one flat conductor of a flexible conductor film with at least 

a conductor lead wire, said contact strip terminal comprising a 
strip-type base part (2) of electrically conducting material and at 

least two groups of teeth (5) projecting outwards relative to a 
surface of said base part (2) for contacting at least one flexible 

conductor of said flexible conductor film, in which each group of 
teeth (5) consists of four pointed triangular teeth, the base of 

each triangle mainly coinciding with the surface of said base part 
(2), said groups of teeth (5) being placed within the periphery of 

the strip-type base part (2), so that the base line of the teeth 
(5) of each group lies on a simple closed contour, wherein each 

tooth (5) has a sharp pointed end (9) and projects over its total 
length mainly at a right angle away from said surface of said base 

part (2), characterized in that the contact strip terminal further 
comprises an edge clip connector for connecting the terminal with 

contact faces of one or both surfaces near an edge of a substrate, 
the edge clip connector comprising a stem strip (34) and a clip 

contact (35) in the form of a closed flat longitudinal loop strip 
which at one end passes into the stem strip (34) and which is bent 

at the other end backwards about a transverse axis (38) of said 
flat loop, so that the legs (36, 37) formed by the two halves of 

said loop come to rest adjacent to each other and together define 
an approximately U-shaped clip opening. 
Contact strip terminal according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the teeth (5) have such dimensions that after bending 

backwards in the direction of the base part (2) they do not extend 
beyond the periphery of said base part (2). 
Contact strip terminal according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that one leg (36) of each half of said 

loop is a meander-shape with at least two supporting bracket contact 
points (36.1, 36.2) directed to the other leg (37), said other 

leg (37) is a slight V-shape, whose top (37.3) is directed to said 
one leg (36) and opposite the bend lying between the two supporting  

 
bracket contact points (36.1, 36.2) of the one leg (36), so that 

the substrate in question can be inserted parallel to the end leg 
part (37.2) of the other leg (37) at an angle to the longitudinal 

direction of the clip contact mainly perpendicular to said transverse 
axis (38) until its edge lies in the said bend of the one leg 

(36) and subsequently can be introduced with lever action on the V-shape 
of the other leg (37) along the longitudinal direction up to 

the closed end of the two halves of the loop.

connector for interconnection with a separate flexible conductor. 
Process for the production of a row of contact strip terminals 
or a single contact strip terminal according to any of the 

preceding claims, in which the contact strip terminals are stamped 
out of a flat sheet of resilient metal and by means of a stem strip 

(34) are held firmly on a carrier strip (39) made from the sheet, 
while after the stamping operation the closed flat loop strip thus 

obtained is bent about said symmetrical transverse axis (38) and 
the stem strip (34) with its related clip contact (35) is bent over 

at right angles relative to the base part (2).
