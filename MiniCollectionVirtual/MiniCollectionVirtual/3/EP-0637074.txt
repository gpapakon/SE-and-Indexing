<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming isolation and active regions, wherein the 
patterning of an oxidation-barrier active stack is performed separately 

in the PMOS and NMOS regions. After the active stack is in place, 
two masking steps are used: one exposes the isolation areas on the 

NMOS side, for stack etch, channel-stop implant, and silicon recess 
etch (optional). The other masking step is exactly complementary, and 

performs the analogous operations on the PMOS side. After these two 
steps are performed (in either order), an additional nitride layer can 

optionally be deposited and etched to cover the sidewall of the active 
stack. Field oxide is then formed, and processing then proceeds in 

conventional fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuit isolation 
structures. Adjacent elements on an integrated circuit must be electrically 
isolated from each other if they are to function independently. 
Therefore, it has long been recognized that the most basic elements of 
integrated circuit technology include not only active devices and 
interconnect, but also isolation. The standard industry process for isolation of CMOS circuits has 
long been LOCOS ("LOCal Oxidation of Silicon"). In this process, a 
stack of silicon nitride and silicon oxide layers (or a stack of silicon 
nitride, polysilicon and oxide layers), is patterned to provide an 
oxidation barrier in locations where active devices are to be formed 
(i.e., the active regions). This stack is referred to as an "active stack." 
Silicon is exposed in locations where a field oxide is desired for 
isolation. A "channel-stop" implant is then performed, using dopants 
which will prevent parasitic transistors from turning on. In CMOS 
processes (including BiCMOS, CBCMOS, etc.), two channel-stop 
implants are often necessary, one for P-type regions and one for N-type 
regions. Thus, two mask steps (in addition to the active mask) are  
 
normally required.¹ The wafer is then placed in an oxidizing environment to grow a 
thick field oxide (typically at least several thousand Ångstroms)² 
 on 
the exposed silicon areas. Silicon under the nitride will generally not 
be oxidized EXCEPT at the edge of the active stack, where lateral 
diffusion of oxygen under the active stack will cause a tapered shape, 
known as a "bird's beak," in the resulting structure. A problem with LOCOS is that the bird's beak costs a substantial 
amount of area. For many years there have therefore been substantial 
attempts to find an alternative to LOCOS. Many of the proposed 
alternative technologies also use localized oxidation, with modifications 
to reduce the width of the bird's beak.³ All conventional isolation process using localized oxidation have 
the following drawbacks as applied to modern technology: 
1. If both n and p channel stop implants must be performed, then 
3 masks will be needed: one for active, one for NMOS channel stop, 
and one for PMOS channel stop. Counterdoping may be able to 
eliminate one of these masks, but counterdoping imposes its own 
constraints. 2. The critical dimension (CD), or minimum geometry, cannot 
be optimized for the active areas in both N-well and P-well regions, 
due to the depth difference caused by typical well formation
