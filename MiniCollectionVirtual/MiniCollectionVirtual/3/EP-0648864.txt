<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the use of iron salts for inhibiting the 
corrosion of metals. Replacement of corroded equipment can be a major expense in an industrial 
process, both from the standpoint of equipment cost and from the standpoint of lost 
production during the replacement process, as well as costs for removal and disposal of 
the corroded equipment. In addition, maintenance costs for equipment in a corrosive 
environment may be high. A number of approaches are utilized to reduce the effects of corrosive substances 
on metal equipment. These include fabricating the equipment from corrosion resistant 
materials such as titanium, zirconium or tantalum; coating or lining the equipment with 
corrosion resistant materials such as glass; and adding corrosion inhibiting substances 
to the corrosive materials. Use of corrosion resistant metals and coating of equipment 
with inert materials can be expensive. When corrosion inhibiting substances are employed care must be taken to fully 
evaluate any proposed metal/corrosion inhibitor system, that is, the metal, the 
corrosive material, the inhibitor, and other components which may be present, in order 
to avoid unexpected results, the most important being failure to inhibit corrosion. For 
example, fluoride ions accelerate the dissolution of titanium oxide. Therefore, 
whenever fluoride ions are present, oxidizing agents generally do not work well as 
titanium corrosion inhibitors. In some cases low concentrations of corrosion inhibitors 
actually increase the corrosion rate. They only function as inhibitors at concentrations 
above what is known as the critical value. In highly corrosive environments, such as occur in the presence of 
sulfuric/hydrocyanic acid mixtures, corrosion resistant metals are often used. 
Unfortunately, such acid mixtures are sufficiently corrosive that even when corrosion 
resistant metals are used unacceptable corrosion often occurs, especially at elevated 
temperatures which occur, for example, in distillation columns during distillation. For 
that reason, corrosion inhibitors are typically added to such mixtures. Corrosion resistance of many of the common metals, including aluminum, iron 
and steel, titanium, and zirconium, is through formation of a metal oxide layer on the 
metal's surface. In environments where water or oxygen are present, such metals 
regenerate metal oxide layers spontaneously. In more aggressive environments, such as 
in the presence of acidic mixtures, the metal oxide layer may be
