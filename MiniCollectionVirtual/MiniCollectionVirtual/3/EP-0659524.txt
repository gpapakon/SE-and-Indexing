<ABSTRACT>
A driver is designed for coaxial and non-coaxial 
driving of a fastener with a lobed drive recess. The driver 

has a part spherical drive head connected by a neck to the 
drive end of a shank coaxially therewith, the outer surface 

of the head defining circumferentially alternating lobes and 
valleys extending longitudinally in planes containing the 

driver axis. The head is shaped such that its longitudinal 
cross section in one of the planes through a valley defines 

a central part-spherical portion and frustoconical end 
portions substantially tangent to the central portion 

respectively at its opposite ends. The head is further 
shaped so that, in its transverse cross section, each of the 

lobes has a leading flank and a trailing flank shaped and 
dimensioned that the flanks do not define undercuts which 

would make molding of the driver difficult.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tools that are used to 
turn fasteners having lobed drive recesses or sockets. In 
particular, the invention relates to tools having a 
generally rounded drive head so as to be tiltable in the 
fastener drive recess to turn the fastener in a non-coaxial 
relationship. The prior art contains a number of tools that have 
rounded or circular drive heads used to turn fasteners that 
have polygonal drive sockets or recesses. The purpose of 
the rounded head is to provide the capability of turning the 
fastener when the drive tool is disposed in an angular 
relationship with respect to the fastener's axis. This 
capability is significant where the fastener is located in a 
hard to reach place. One such driver is disclosed in U.S. 
patent no. 4,246,811 and is designed for turning a fastener 
with a polygonal drive recess. The driver has a rounded 
head which, in longitudinal cross section, is elliptical, 
resulting in a shape which is rather difficult to fabricate. Another such driver is disclosed in U.S. patent no. 
4,824,418, which discloses an articulated joint between two 
shafts, the one shaft having a lobed recess and the other 
having an enlarged rounded drive head. Again, however, the 
drive head in longitudinal cross section defines two non-concentric 
hemispheres. One standard type of lobed-recess fastener is that sold 
by CamCar/Textron under the trademark "TORX", for which 
there are mateable lobed drivers. Heretofore, however, 
there have not been provided any effective ball-type TORX 
drivers to provide non-coaxial driving of a TORX fastener. It is a general object of the invention to provide an 
improved male driver of the tiltable type which avoids the 
disadvantages of prior drivers while affording additional 
structural and operating advantages.  An important feature of the invention is the provision 
of a driver which will afford non-coaxial driving of a TORX 
fastener. In connection with the foregoing feature, another 
feature of the invention is the provision of a driver of the 
type set forth which has a generally part-spherical drive 
head which can have a maximum transverse thickness greater 
than that of the associated driver shaft. In connection with the foregoing features, another 
feature of the invention is the provision of a driver of the 
type set forth, which is of relatively simple and economical 
construction and which can be fabricated by a number of 
different techniques. Still another feature of the invention is the provision 
of a driver of

<CLAIMS>
A driver comprising: a shaft having an axis and a 
drive end, a ball-type drive head, and a neck connecting 

said head to said drive end of said shaft substantially 
coaxially therewith, said head having an outer surface 

defining circumferentially alternating lobes and valleys 
extending longitudinally in planes containing said axis, 

said head being shaped such that its longitudinal cross 
section in one of said planes through a valley defines 
a 
central part-spherical portion having a distal end and a 

neck end and frustoconical end portions substantially 
tangent to said central portion respectively at the distal 

and neck ends thereof. 
The driver of claim 1, wherein said part-spherical 
portion extends on both sides of a radial plane 

perpendicular to said axis. 
The driver of claim 2, wherein said part-spherical 
portion extends substantially equidistantly on each side of 

said radial plane. 
The driver of claim 1, wherein each of said lobes 
is generally triangular in transverse cross section and has 

an apex which is more rounded adjacent to said central 
portion than it is to adjacent to said end portions. 
The driver of claim 1, wherein said shaft is 
polygonal in transverse cross section. 
A driver comprising: a shaft having an axis and a 
drive end, a ball-type drive head having a center and 

connected to said drive end of said shaft substantially 
coaxially therewith, said head being shaped such that its 

transverse cross section through its center perpendicular to 
the axis defines a plurality of equiangularly spaced-apart 

lobes projecting radially outwardly relative to said axis, 
each of said lobes having a leading flank and a trailing 

flank shaped and dimensioned such that no part of a first 
leading flank on a first lobe or of a second trailing flank 

on a second lobe once removed from said first lobe extends 
 

to the axis side of a plane parallel to said axis and 
tangent to said first and second flanks. 
The driver of claim 6, wherein said head has an 
even number of said lobes. 
The driver of claim 7, wherein the number of said 
lobes is six. 
The driver of claim 6, wherein each of said flanks 
extends from a peak of the associated lobe to a valley 

disposed between the associated lobe and an adjacent lobe, 
the peaks of said lobes being tangent to a first common 

imaginary circle and the valleys between said lobes being 
tangent to a second common imaginary circle concentric with 

said first circle. 
The driver of claim 6, wherein said head has a 
maximum transverse thickness which is greater than that of 

said shaft.
