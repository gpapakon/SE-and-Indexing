<ABSTRACT>
A method of observability characterization for data posts in a digital terrain 
elevation data structure is obtained by calculating intervisibility with respect to 

surrounding data posts within a given radius. By then summing the number of data posts 
within this radius and visible to the data post of interest, an observability value may then 

be associated with the data post of interest. This observability value represents 
observability generally with respect to surrounding terrain as a whole, not with respect to 

a specific other point in the database. In this manner, terrain may be evaluated for 
observability generally in, for example, route selection procedures where observability 

plays a role.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to use of digital terrain elevation data 
(DTED), and particularly to use of a transformation function applied to digital terrain 
elevation data to reveal terrain masked areas of low observability. Digital terrain elevation data represents surface altitude at discrete "data posts." 
Each data post has a surface location or address, e.g., latitude and longitude, and an 
associated altitude, e.g., vertical offset relative to sea level. Thus, a simple form of a 
DTED database would deliver a scaler altitude in response to longitude and latitude 
input. More complicated DTED databases have been developed for certain applications. 
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,899,292 issued February 6, 1990 to J. F. Dawson and 
E. W. Ronish shows a tessellation method for creating a spherical database by warping a 
digital map, including digital terrain elevation data, by longitude and latitude parameters. DTED database systems are used in flight mission computer systems and flight 
planning strategy in military applications to aid in, for example, covert and evasive flight 
operations. As used in mission computer systems, a DTED database can aid a pilot in 
time-critical maneuvers such as in selecting evasive routes with respect to a given threat 
position. Threat positions may be known in advance and included in the DTED 
database, or detected while in flight. The computation and speed required in accessing 
and calculating routes or alternatives based on DTED database systems can be vitally 
critical, especially for computations executed repeatedly to keep a pilot fully appraised of 
current terrain conditions and route alternatives. Thus, improvements in methods of 
accessing DTED database systems and computations based on extracted DTED are not 
simply improvements in computational elegance, but can be life-saving and critical to 
mission success. A DTED database may be used in flight planning for low altitude covert air 
routes. Such routes should be well obscured by surrounding terrain, i.e., terrain masked. 
A DTED database used to determine local minimums of terrain altitude, with the 
assumption that local minimums of terrain altitude correspond to local minimums in 
observability, could provide an observability function. FIG. 1 is a computer generated 
topographic map illustrating such prior use of a terrain elevation map wherein darker  
 
areas are associated with relatively low elevation and lighter colored areas are associated 
with relatively higher elevation. Thus,
