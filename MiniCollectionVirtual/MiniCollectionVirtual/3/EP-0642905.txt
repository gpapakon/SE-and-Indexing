<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing isocyanate/wood mixture mouldings from the press platen of a pressing device without leaving a residue using an aqueous paraffin dispersion, where the press platen and/or the surface of the pressing is/are treated with the paraffin dispersion and with aqueous alkali before the pressing of the isocyanate/wood mixture. A mould release agent which is suitable for this purpose, in the form of an aqueous release solution, contains from 3 to 10% by weight of alkali and from 25 to 60% by weight of dispersed paraffin having a melting point of from 50 to 70 DEG C, in each case based on the total weight of the release solution.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the residue-free detachment of 
isocyanate-wood composite moldings from the pressing 

plates or molds of a press using an agueous paraffin 
dispersion, wherein, prior to the pressing of the isocyanate-wood 

mixture, the pressing plates and molds 
and/or the surface of the pressed body is treated with 

the paraffin dispersion and agueous alkali metal 
hydroxide. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
agueous alkali metal hydroxide used is sodium hydroxide 

solution and/or potassium hydroxide solution. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein an 
aqueous mixture of paraffin dispersion and alkali metal 

hydroxide is used. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
agueous mixture contains from 3 to 10% by weight of 

alkali metal hydroxide and from 25 to 60% by weight of 
paraffin, in each case based on the total weight of the 

mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
agueous mixture contains from 4 to 8% by weight of NaOH 

or KOH. 
A mold release composition in the form of an 
agueous release solution containing from 3 to 10% by 

weight of alkali metal hydroxide and from 25 to 60% by 
weight of dispersed paraffin having a melting point of 

from 50 to 70Â°C, in each case based on the total weight 
of the release solution. 
A mold release composition as claimed in claim 6 
containing from 4 to 8% by weight of NaOH and/or KOH.
