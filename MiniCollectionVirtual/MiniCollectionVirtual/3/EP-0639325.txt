<ABSTRACT>
For the stepped line connection of a water inlet (7) to in each case one of a plurality of water outlets (8), a switching mechanism (17), which is located essentially in the dry and intended for a locking member (13), is designed such that it effects a switching operation only in the case of the spring-operated return stroke of its drive (16). The through-passage opening (50) of the locking member (13) can thus assume essentially the same position in the initial position of the distributor (1) as in the subsequent stroke end position, this resulting in very favourable flow conditions.

fluid outlets (8) to the fluid inlet (7), as well as for
blocking at least one other of the fluid outlets (8) at

an openable blocking area (11) in in each case a given
operating-control position and which in the opened

blocking area (11) determines an operating passage
cross-section, with the drive (16) defining an inope
rative

movement, particularly in such a way that the switching
mechanism (17) for switching from one control position

position, characterized by at least one of the following
features:


a) the switching movement only takes place on part of
the working movement,
b) the starting position coincides with an operating-control
position
