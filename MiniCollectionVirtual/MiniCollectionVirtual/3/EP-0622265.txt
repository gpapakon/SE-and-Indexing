<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (10) for an electric vehicle (14) is 
provided which imposes an identification signal on the 

outlet voltage to inform the battery charger (16) of the 
characteristics of the outlet (e.g., the maximum current and 

voltage) to allow the battery charger (16) to charge at the 
maximum possible rate allowable by the outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to electric vehicle
power systems and more specifically to an adapter for
connecting an on-vehicle battery charger with an electrical
outlet wherein the adapter transmits certain electrical
characteristics of the outlet to the charger.Electric vehicle battery systems typically employ
charging facilities with unique features and greater power
transfer capabilities than most conventional electrical
outlets. Therefore, specially adapted recharging stations
are provided with power supply capability coincident with
the recharge capability of the electric vehicle power
system. Nevertheless, it is desirable to have the
capability to recharge electric vehicles using either
specially adapted charging facilities or standard wall
outlets if such a charging facility is unavailable. The
specially adapted charging facilities may deliver current at
a rate of about 230 volts and 30 amps while a standard wall
outlet delivers 120 volts and 12 amps.It is desirable to produce an electric vehicle power
system capable of being recharged anywhere in the world.
One obstacle, however, lies in the different electrical
services provided throughout the world. For example, the
line voltage in the United States is 120 volts while in
Europe it is 230 volts. Household-type appliances are known
which transform the different outlet voltages to a common
voltage to operate the appliance. However, in this method
the power transfer capabilities of the outlets are not fully
utilized. A special outlet is capable of handling a
significantly higher current than a standard wall outlet and
thus, a battery can be charged at a faster rate. If a
battery charger attempts to charge through a standard wall
outlet at the high current of a special outlet, current in
excess of the ratings for the outlet and household wiring
will flow thereby tripping a circuit breaker or blowing a
fuse. JP-A-2 146 937 discloses a battery charger which is
connected to a power supply outlet through a cable connector
having a number of short-circuit terminals. A control
circuit controls the flow of current into the battery
charger according to a selection of one of the short circuit
terminals, the selection being made by the user according to
the type of power source. An abnormal current flow is
thereby avoided. This document does not however disclose an
adapter which incorporates the means to inform the battery
charger of the characteristics of the power outlet without
user intervention.DE-A-3 537 432 discloses an optical signal coupler
