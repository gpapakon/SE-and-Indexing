<ABSTRACT>
The air bearing surface of a magnetic head slider is formed with two side rails (32, 34) 
and a wishbone-shaped rail configuration between the side rails, which may be 

rectangular or ablated. The rail configuration includes segments (26, 28) forming a V 
and segments (38, 40) extending from the V rail segments towards the trailing edge of 

the slider. The rail configuration is centered or offset relative to the sides of the slider. 
Leading edge tapers (36, 42, 44) are provided for the side rails and rail configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
Copending U.S. patent application Serial Number 07/982,853 filed November 30, 1992 
on behalf of Stephen S. Murray, and assigned to the same assignee, discloses magnetic 
head sliders having air bearing surfaces with configured rails. This invention relates to air bearing magnetic head sliders used in disk drives and in 
particular to head sliders with configured air bearing surfaces. A magnetic recording head assembly used in a disk drive typically incorporates an air 
bearing slider carrying at least one magnetic transducer that flys over the surface of a 
magnetic disk for transducing data signals. One objective for improving the transducing 
relationship between the magnetic transducer and the magnetic disk is to provide a low 
flying height or very close spacing between the transducer and the disk during operation 
of the disk drive. When used with very narrow transducing gaps and very thin magnetic 
films, the close spacing allows short wavelength, high frequency signals to be recorded, 
thereby affording high density, high storage capacity recording. It is also desirable to 
maintain a substantially constant flying height and a tightly controlled pitch of the slider 
relative to the disk surface so that the signal being processed is accurate. To realize 
controlled pitch and constant flying height, pitch stiffness of the air bearing slider needs 
to be controlled. One known type of air bearing slider, illustrated in Fig. 1, employs a cross bar or cross 
rail adjacent to the leading edge of the slider. The leading edge of the slider is the edge 
over which air first passes to provide aerodynamic lift to the slider during operation in a 
disk drive. The trailing edge of the slider is opposite to the leading edge. A magnetic 
transducer for recording and reading data on a magnetic disk is located at the trailing 
edge. A negative pressure region is produced to provide a self-loading slider with fast 
liftoff during operation of the magnetic heads in disk drives. However, such head  
 
sliders are known to be subject to entrapment of stray particles, which can cause head 
crashes and undue wear of the slider. An object of this invention is to provide an air bearing slider having a configuration that 
substantially avoids entrapment of stray particles. Another object of this invention is to provide an air bearing slider which minimizes or 
eliminates head crashes. Another object is to provide an air bearing slider that reduces wear of magnetic heads 
and disks during data signal processing. A further
