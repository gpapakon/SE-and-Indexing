<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for phase selection for single-pole tripping of high-impedance ground faults in direct grounded power networks. Starting from the ratio of the negative-sequence voltage to the zero-sequence current (U2/I0) and the ratio of the negative-sequence voltage to the positive-sequence voltage (U2/U1), two criteria with different conditions are formed, each of which indicating a faulted phase, and if both criteria indicate the same phase as faulted, single-pole tripping can take place.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is both desirable and important, in the event of a fault 
in a power network, not to overreact by disconnecting all 
the phases when, for example, there is a fault in one of the 
phases only. The great problem in this connection, at least 
for faults with a high fault resistance, is to be able to 
determine which phase, or which phases, has (have) faulted. 
The present invention relates to a method and a device for 
phase selection for single-pole tripping of high-impedance 
ground faults in direct grounded power networks. Determining which phase has faulted, or which phases have 
faulted, will hereafter, in accordance with the terminology 
used within this technical field, be referred to as "phase 
selection". A number of different fault types occur in a power network, 
for which it is desired to learn as quickly as possible in 
which phase or phases a fault has occurred. The reason for 
this is that a faulted phase/faulted phases is/are to be 
disconnected from the supply sources to prevent dangerous 
situations from arising. In relatively simple networks and in relatively simple 
contexts a phase selection can be made, in the event of a 
fault, by determining by means of phase-current measuring 
members that a phase current exceeds a pre-set value. An obvious and simple method, in principle, is to use as 
phase selection determining criterion phase current changes 
exceeding a certain value related to nominal phase currents. 
In US-A-3,956,671, such a method is described which is 
otherwise based on directional wave detectors for each phase 
and which comprises a phase selector for single-phase  
 
tripping of circuit breakers for a faulted phase and for 
three-phase tripping of the circuit breakers of all the 
phases when faults occur on two or three phases. In another method for phase selection, the voltage reduction 
of the phases involved, which a fault generally results in, 
is also utilized in addition to the phase currents. In 
principle, this comprises using a voltage-dependent 
overcurrent relay or, as it is called within this technical 
field, an underimpedance relay. Such relays are described in 
a number of variants, for example as in ASEA Information RK 
556-300 E, Nov. 1974, "Impedance Relay Type RXZF 2" and RK 
556-301 E, Feb. 1979, "Three phase impedance relay type 
RXZK". These relays are activated when an impedance, 
calculated with measured voltages and currents, lies within 
an operating range, specific to the relay and defined in an 
R-X diagram. The methodology in this

complex numbers with one real part and one imaginary part, 

which method is 
characterized in that
 with the aid of the 
symmetrical components, a first ratio U2/I0 is formed as a 

first complex quantity in the form of a real part A and an

second complex quantity in the form of a real part D and an 
imaginary part E 


U2/I0 = A + jB 
U2/U1 = D + jE 
 
and when there is a zero-sequence current, the faulted phase 

is determined according to a first criterion with conditions 
based on the first complex quantity and a second criterion 

with conditions based on the second complex quantity, and 
when the same phase is indicated as faulted by both the 

first and the second criterion, single-phase tripping of 
this phase takes place.
