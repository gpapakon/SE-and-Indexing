<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of rebuilding a papermaking machine,
which has a conventional C-wrap type twin wire forming section, for the manufacture
of a sanitary paper web, said method including incorporating in said machine a TAD
section for thermally predrying the formed paper web by passing hot air through the
web, said C-wrap type twin wire forming section having an endless looped inner
forming fabric, a forming roll that is rotatable in a direction and is located inside of the
inner forming fabric loop and has a portion wrapped by a portion of the inner forming
fabric, an endless looped outer forming fabric partially wrapping said portion of the
inner forming fabric, means for guiding the forming fabrics so as to form between them
a converging forming throat located at a lower rising quadrant of the rotatable forming
roll and curving along an upstream part of said wrapped portion of the forming roll,
and a headbox for discharging a jet of papermaking furnish obliquely upwards into the
forming throat, said furnish on drainage through at least the outer forming fabric being
formed into a paper web sandwiched between the two forming fabrics, and said TAD
section including an endless looped TAD fabric and at least one hollow TAD cylinder
that is rotatable in the same direction as the forming roll and has a foraminous shell for
the passage of hot air therethrough from the exterior to the interior of said at least one
TAD cylinder in order to thermally predry the web, said at least one TAD cylinder
being located inside of the TAD fabric loop and having a top portion that is wrapped
by a portion of the TAD fabric.The term "sanitary paper" as used herein is a generic term intended to include all
kinds of creped or uncreped paper used for sanitary purposes, such as bathroom tissue,
including toilet tissue and facial tissue, paper handkerchiefs, paper towels, kitchen or
household paper, and industrial tissue or towel paper, for example. Occasionally, the
term "tissue" is used for the same purpose.Similarly, the term "TAD" as used herein is intended to mean "through air
drying" or "through air dried" depending on the context in which the term is used. The present invention also relates to a C-wrap type twin wire former of the kind
having an endless looped inner forming fabric, a rotatable forming roll that is located
inside of the inner forming fabric loop and has a portion wrapped by a portion of the
inner forming fabric, an endless looped outer forming fabric partially wrapping said
portion
