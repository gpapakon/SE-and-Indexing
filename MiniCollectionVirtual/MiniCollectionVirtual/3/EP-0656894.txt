<ABSTRACT>
Starting from a mixture containing tocopherol, fats and/or derivatives of fats, in particular fatty acids, and optionally sterol and/or sterol derivatives, the free fatty acids present in the mixture are esterified using a lower alcohol. The mixture with the lower alcohol is then transesterified in the presence of a basic catalyst. Following the transesterification, excess lower alcohol is distilled off from the reaction mixture. The transesterification catalyst and any glycerin which may be present are separated off and the fatty-acid alkyl ester distilled off from the mixture. The method is suitable for use with many different starting mixtures and does not use any solvents with toxic or polluting effects. High yields are obtained with limited thermal effects. The method can also be carried out economically on an industrial scale. It is possible to isolate tocopherol and sterol simultaneously.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the recovery of tocopherol and/or sterol concentrates
from tocopherol- and/or sterol-containing mixtures of fats and/or fatty

derivatives by esterification of free fatty acids with methanol,
alkali-catalyzed transesterification of the triglycerides with methanol and

removal of the fatty acid methyl esters by distillation, 
characterized in that

the transesterification mixture is acidified to neutralization and the alkaline
catalyst is removed by washing before distillation.
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 steamer
distillates of soybean oil are used as the mixtures of fats and/or fat

derivatives.
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the residue
accumulating in the production of rapeseed oil methyl ester is used as the

mixture of fats and/or fat derivatives.
