<ABSTRACT>
The decorative dish consists of two parts (1, 2) which are longitudinal cutouts from a thin-walled hollow cylinder whose radian measure is less than 180@. The longitudinal edges of the hollow-cylinder cutouts extend at an acute angle to the line of symmetry. The first part (1) has a slot (4) which is closed on both sides, extends symmetrically and at right angles to the line of symmetry and into which the second part (2) is pushed, the narrower ends of both parts pointing in the same direction. The tapered end, pushed through the slot (4), of the second part and the mid-point of the arcuately extending edge of the opposite end of the first part (1) form the standing points.
