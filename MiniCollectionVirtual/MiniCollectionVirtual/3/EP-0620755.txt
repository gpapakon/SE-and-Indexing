<ABSTRACT>
The filter system comprises a filter element (10) arranged in wave- or zig-zag-shaped folds and having flat filter element portions (12) and intermediate bending lines (14). The longitudinal edges of the filter element (10) are connected to tensioning bands (20). When the filter element (10) is stretched, these tensioning bands (20) are tensioned and in their tensioned condition fulfill a holding function for holding the filter element portions (12) in the stretched condition of the filter element (10). Thus, no spacers are required on the filter frame (22) for maintaining the stability of shape of the filter element (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a filter system for
filtering fluids, particularly gases, particularly for
filtering air streaming into the passenger cabin of a
vehicle, comprising a filter element folded in a wave-shaped
or zig-zag-shaped manner having bending lines
and substantially plane filter element folding portions
arranged therebetween, the filter element being adapted
to be stretched in the direction of its successive
folding portions and to be compressed in the opposite
direction.A pleated paper filter is known from French Patent
No. 1,289,456, provided with longitudinal paper glued
to the edge of the filter. The paper filter is
maintained in the pleated zig-zag condition by a rigid
peripheral framework in conjunction with longitudinal
and transverse support wires. The transverse wires are
attached to two parallel longitudinal wires side edges
of the filter. The transverse support wires engage the
filter at the bending lines of each pleat fold
maintaining the pleat structure and spacing.Filter systems for filtering air streaming into
the passenger cabin of a vehicle are known in a wide
range of versions. Examples of such known filter
devices are described in German Laid-open Application
Nos. 25 57 444, 35 29 579, 35 34 318, 37 16 243 and 38
15 907, as well as in German Patent Specifications 21
38 412 and 34 39 255 and, finally, in German Utility
Model 80 01 798. A common feature of all these filter
systems resides in that the filter element is fixedly
mounted in a filter frame so that exchange of the
filter element is not possible without exchanging the
filter frame along with it. In known filter systems, the filter element is
arranged in wave- or zig-zag-shaped folds for enlarging
the filtering area. Since the filtering materials (for
instance, paper or non-woven materials) have hardly any
inherent stability of shape, there is either added an
air-permeable reticular support structure to the filter
element, or there are provided spacers for keeping the
substantially plane folding portions of the filter
element between successive bending lines of the filter
element at mutual distances and thus maintaining said
filter element folding portions in their V-shaped
orientation relative to each other. The provision of
spacers complicates the construction of the filter
system.The filter system known from EP 0 170 643
comprises a filter element adapted for insertion into a
filter frame. The filter element is accommodated in
the filter frame in a manner allowing exchange of the
filter element. For providing
