<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a disc shaped recording medium (1) 
having a first recording region in which an information signal recorded using pits and a 

second recording region in which an information signal recorded using a magneto-optical 
method includes a rotational driving unit (2), a servo apparatus (9) and a 

controller (11). A head moves (3,4) between the first and second recording regions of 
the disc-shaped recording medium and records and reproducing information signals to 

and from the disc-shaped recording medium. The rotational driving unit rotates the 
disc-shaped recording medium at a constant linear velocity by using the output signal 

outputted from the head. The servo apparatus generates a servo signal according to an 
error signal generated using the output signal from the head and carries out servo 

control on the head and rotational driving unit. The controller determines which of the 
first or second regions of the disc-shaped recording medium the head is in based on the 

output signal from the head and then uses this determination result to control the servo 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for a disc-shaped recording medium. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for reproducing information signals having
differing reproduction principles which are recorded on a
disc-shaped recording medium.Systems using optical discs and magneto-optical discs as a
recording medium where the user can reproduce or record and
reproducing data such as music data are well known. For example,
optical disc reproducing apparatus such as CD (Compact Disc)
players which are dedicated to reproduce and recording and/or
reproducing apparatus which use magneto-optical discs.While data is reproduced from the optical disc by this kind
of recording and/or reproducing apparatus, a light beam is
radiated, onto the signal recording surface by an optical head and
data is then read out by detecting the light beam which is
reflected by the recording surface. In order that the light beam 
is radiated in an appropriate manner, a tracking servo and a
focusing servo is controlled the position of an objective lens
within the optical head and a sled servo feeds the optical head in
an radial direction of the disc.Also, the operating modes, for example, the tracking operation
modes and the spindle servo modes at the time of recording and
reproducing are different for read only type optical discs as CDs,
where the information is physically formed as convex or
concave-shaped pits, and magneto-optical discs, where
magneto-optical areas in which the user can record information are
provided.It therefore follows that with recording and/or reproducing
apparatus for optical discs which have both regions in which the
information is recorded to use pits, hereinafter referred to as pit
regions, and recordable regions which are capable of being recorded
in, it is necessary to switch over between the tracking operation
mode and the spindle servo mode.When the optical disc is a magneto-optical disc on which the
user can, for example, record music etc., a pit region 50a is
provided at the innermost side of the disc, as shown in FIG. 1(a).
At this pit region, TOC information (referred to hereinafter as a
"P-TOC") for managing the disc attributes and recorded data etc.
is recorded using pits. This is followed by a recordable region
50b, in which management information (referred to hereinafter as
a "U-TOC") to be used in re-writing by the user is recorded along
with usual data such as music etc. A wobbled pregroove is formed
