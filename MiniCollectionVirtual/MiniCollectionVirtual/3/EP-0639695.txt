<ABSTRACT>
Valve stem seal comprising a rigid, non-deformable tube (1) which is bounded at one end by a first cylinder section (3) and at the other end by a flange (2) projecting radially outwards, a self-locking sealing ring (7) being inserted into the cylinder section (3), which sealing ring has a radially elastic sealing lip (8), projecting in an axial direction, which can be brought into engagement with the valve stem, circumferentially distributed ribs (13), being provided on the cylinder section (3), where they project radially towards the sealing ring (7), and/or on the sealing ring (7), where they project radially towards the cylinder section (3), and the sealing ring (7) and the cylinder section (3) touching one another only in the area of the ribs (13).

A valve stem seal comprising a tube (1) resistant 
to deformation which is bounded at one end by a first 

cylindrical section (3) and at the other end by a 
flange (2) which projects radially outwards, the cylindrical 

section (3) having inserted into it in a self-locking 
manner a sealing ring (7) which has a radially 

flexible sealing lip (9) which projects in the axial 
direction and can be brought into engagement with the 

valve stem, characterized in that circumferentially 
distributed ribs (13) which project radially in the 

direction of the sealing ring (7) are provided on the 
cylindrical section (3) and/or circumferentially distributed 

ribs (13) which project radially in the direction 
of the cylindrical section (9) are provided on the 

sealing ring (7), and in that the sealing ring (7) and 
the cylindrical section (3) touch one another only in the 

region of the ribs (13). 
A valve stem seal according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the ribs (13) are distributed uniformly 

in the circumferential direction. 
A valve stem seal according to either of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the ribs (13) have a triangular 

profile which tapers from the base in the direction 
of the tip. 
A valve stem seal according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the height of the ribs (13), 

measured in the radial direction, amounts to a few 
hundreds of a millimetre more than the difference between 

half the inside diameter of the cylindrical section and 
half the outside diameter of the sealing ring.  

 
A valve stem seal according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the cylindrical section (3) 

is bounded at the end remote from the first flange (2) by 
a second flange (4) projecting radially inwards. 
A valve stem seal according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the cylindrical section (3) and the 

second flange (4) overlap the sealing ring (7) and the 
sealing lip (8) axially over their entire length and in 

that the sealing lip (8) is freely movable in the radial 
direction. 
A valve stem seal according to any of claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the sealing ring (7) comprises 

a reinforcing ring (11) and a flexible sealing 
element. 
A valve stem seal according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the sealing element comprises at least 

one sealing lip (8) which can be brought into engagement 
with the valve stem and at least one sealing rib which 

can be brought into engagement with the valve guide, the 
said lip and rib merging integrally into one another.
