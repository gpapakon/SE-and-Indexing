<ABSTRACT>
According to Figure 1, a scanning plate (171) of a length measuring device (11) is illuminated with parallel light by a light source (31) and a condensor (101). Parallel light beams impinge on a number of prisms which are combined to form a prism plate (191) and are allocated to the scanning fields (111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161) of the scanning plate (171) and which deflect the light by small but different angles so that the light, after reflection by the measurement division carrier (181) passes from the individual scanning fields (111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161) to small photodiodes (41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91) allocated to these fields. The prisms (191) in this arrangement form a row which is arranged perpendicularly to the direction of measurement.

<CLAIMS>
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
with an illuminated measurement division carrier 

(181), at least one scanner plate (171) with a 
plurality of scanner fields and a plurality of 

prisms (191) with a plurality of differently 
inclined regions for separating ray beams as well 

as with at least one lens (101) for focusing the 
ray beam on photodetectors arranged after it,
characterised in that
 
the prisms (191) are arranged in at least one row 

transversely to the measuring direction and in 
that the differently inclined regions of the 

prisms (191) are each allocated to one scanner 
field (111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161) of the 

scanner plate (171), the ray beams deflected by 
the prisms (191) being focused via the lens (101) 

on to the photodetectors (41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91). 
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a 
light source (31) and a plurality of 

photodetectors positioned symmetrically to same  
 

are arranged on a board (21), in that a lens (101) 
is arranged after this board (21) in the direction 

of the beam, then the row of prisms (191),
 
subsequently the scanner plate (171) and 

thereafter a reflective measurement division 
carrier (181). 
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
measurement division carrier (183) has a crosswise 

division with division marks running perpendicular 
to one another, and that the prisms (194) are 

arranged in rows which in each case run 
perpendicular to the measurement direction with 

which they are associated. 
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
measurement division carrier is a cylinder surface 

(184). 
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
cylinder surface (184) has a crosswise division  

 
with division marks running perpendicular to one 

another and to which marks rows of prisms (194) 
are allocated which in each case run perpendicular 

to the measurement direction with which they are 
associated. 
Photoelectric length or angle measuring device 
according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 a 
cylindrical lens (324) is arranged in the beam 

path, which lens focuses the illumination ray 
beam on to the cylinder axis.
