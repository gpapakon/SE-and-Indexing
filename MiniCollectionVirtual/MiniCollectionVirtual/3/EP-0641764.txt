)-alkylcarbonylamino,

by reacting compounds of the formula II


in which R is as defined above, with compounds of the
formula III



in which n is as defined above, in inert aprotic solvents
in the presence of a base to give compounds of the

formula IV 


in which R and n are as defined above, and rearranging
the compound of formula IV using an alkali metal

hydroxide, which comprises not isolating the compound of
the formula IV and, following reaction of the compound of

the formula II with the compound of the formula III,
adding water, removing the salt-containing aqueous phase

at a pH of from 0 to 7 and further reacting the organic
phase to give the compound of the formula I.
The process as claimed in claim 1, which comprises
preparing a compound of the formula Ia



in which R and n are as defined in claim 1.
The process as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2,
wherein R is hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, hydroxyl

or chlorine.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 3, wherein the inert aprotic solvent used is

diethoxymethane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether,
triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran,

monoethylene glycol diethyl ether, monoethylene
glycol dimethyl ether or methyl tert-butyl ether.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein the inert aprotic solvent comprises from

0 to 30% by weight of water.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein the inert aprotic solvent comprises from

1 to 10% by weight of water.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 6, wherein the base used is an alkali metal

carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate, alkaline earth metal 
carbonate, alkaline earth metal bicarbonate, alkali metal

hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, alkaline earth
metal oxide or a tertiary amine.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 7, wherein the alkali metal hydroxide used is

lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium
hydroxide or mixtures thereof.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 8, which comprises carrying it out in the presence

of anionic, cationic or nonionic surfactants or phase
transfer catalysts.
