<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the production of low-fat and low-cholesterol pulverulent egg-based products, the pulverulent starting material being extracted with liquid propane at a pressure 
<
/= 200 bar and a temperature 
<
/= 70@C. In this manner, low-cholesterol and low-fat pulverulent egg-based products having good sensory properties are produced without in this case substantial removal of the phospholipids, in particular lecithin, being performed.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of egg-based products in 
powder form with a reduced fat and cholesterol 

content by treatment with compressed gases,
wherein
 
the egg-based starting material in powder form is 

extracted with liquid propane at a pressure of 
≦ 200 x 10⁵ Pa (200 bar) and a temperature of 

≦ 70°C. 
Process as claimed in claim 1,
wherein
 
the extraction is carried out at a pressure of 10 

to 60 x 10⁵ Pa (10 to 60 bar) and at a temperature 
between 20 and 60°C. 
Process as claimed in claims 1 and 2,
wherein
 
the extraction temperature is between 25 and 50°C. 
Process as claimed in claims 1 to 3,
wherein
 
1 to 30 kg propane is used per kg starting 

material. 
Process as claimed in claims 1 to 4,
wherein
 
the fats and cholesterol derivatives are separated 

from the propane by evaporation and/or reduction in 
pressure.  

 
Process as claimed in claims 1 to 5,
wherein
 
the propane is used in a mixture with butane.
