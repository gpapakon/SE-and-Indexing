<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for discharging cold rolled tubes after a cold pilger mill with stepwise feed and/or rotation of the tube, in which the tube is deflected from the rolling direction in a buffer zone between the rolling zone and a driver (pinch roll unit) operating at constant speed to compensate for the cyclically nonuniform rolling speed. According to the invention, the tube (R) is deflected in a S by constrained guidance.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the removal of cold-rolled tubes behind a cold pilger
rolling mill (1) with intermittent advance and/or rotation of the tube, in which

the tube, between the rolling zone and a driver (5) operating at constant speed
is deflected from the rolling direction to balance the cyclically non-uniform

rolling speed in a buffer zone,

characterised in that

through parallel displacement of the tube between the cold pilger rolling mill (1)
and the driver (5), a bending line curved in an S-shape is forced upon the tube,

in which bending line the finished tube lengths which have emerged under the
influence of the accelerations and decelerations of the rolling mill between the

positions of maximum acceleration and maximum deceleration of the rolling mill
are temporarily stored.
A method for the removal of cold-rolled tubes according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the forced-on bending line is curved several times in alternating directions.
A method for the removal of cold-rolled tubes according to Claim 1 and
2,

characterised in that

the forced-on curvature of the bending line can be adjusted.
A device to carry out the method according to one of Claims 1-3,
consisting of a cold pilger rolling mill (1), a driver (5) and a guide channel (4)

arranged between the cold pilger rolling mill (1) and driver (5),

characterised in that

the guide channel (4) is closed on at least three sides and has a guide wall (6)
adjustable transversely to the guide channel (4) in the deflection direction of the 

tube (R), which wall (6) brings about the deflection of the tube.
