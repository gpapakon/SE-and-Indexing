<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide color 
reversal photographic light-sensitive material, particularly 
to a silver halide color reversal photographic light-sensitive 
material improved in color reproducibility and graininess. The demand for higher quality images in silver halide 
color reversal photographic light-sensitive materials has 
become strong in recent years. And graininess, sharpness and 
color reproducibility are regarded to be especially important 
among various photographic properties required in forming 
images. It is known that dye images are formed on a silver halide 
color photographic light-sensitive material by color 
development which comprises reaction between an aromatic 
primary amine color developing agent and a coupler. However,  
 
dyes formed from the usual couplers are not necessarily ideal 
in absorption spectrum; especially, magenta and cyan dyes have 
disadvantages in photographic color reproduction, such as a 
broad absorption spectrum and a secondary absorption in the 
short wavelength region. Particularly, such a secondary 
absorption in the short wavelength region is liable to 
deteriorate saturation. Use of a pyrazoloazole-type magenta 
coupler is known as a measure to minimize the secondary 
absorption. However, when used in a color reversal 
photographic material, this type coupler has disadvantages of 
deteriorating sensitivity and graininess, though it decreases 
the secondary absorption. Accordingly, elimination of such 
defects are desired. As a measure to improve the graininess, enhancement of an 
inter-image effect is known. And as a means to enhance the 
inter-image effect, addition of a diffusible 4-thiazoline-2-one 
to a color reversal photographic material is known; use of 
an N-substituted 4-thiazoline-2-one compound in development of 
a color photographic material to reduce a silver halide to 
silver is also known as another means. However, these methods 
are not necessarily satisfactory; therefore, daylight-type 
high-speed color reversal photographic materials which are 
commmercially available are rather poor in color reproduction 
because of their insufficient inter-image effect, and 
improvement in that point is strongly demanded.  Meanwhile, there is an increasing concern for pollution 
of the natural environment caused by processing solutions for 
silver halide color light-sensitive materials. Although 
highly safe raw materials are used in these processing 
solutions, harmful influences of formalin used in a 
stabilizing solution,
