<ABSTRACT>
A panel particularly but not exclusively usable for 
fireproof partition walls and process for manufacturing it. 

The panel comprises at least two sandwiches (117,118) made 
of heat-bonded regenerated natural and/or synthetic textile 

fibers and/or made of heat-bonded synthetic and/or natural 
fibers. At least one sheet of corrugated cardboard (116), 

coupled to, and arranged between, composite heat insulation 
sheets (119,120), is arranged between these sandwiches. 

The process for manufacturing the panel comprises steps for 
compressing the sandwiches while heat is applied and a step 

for coupling, by means of adhesives, to the at least one 
sheet of corrugated cardboard and/or one or more composite 

thermal insulation sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panel particularly 
but not exclusively usable for fireproof partition walls 
and to the process for manufacturing it. Panels substantially constituted by an internal layer 
of glass wool, interposed between layers of chipwood and 
externally covered with layers of melaminic and/or phenolic 
resins, are currently used for the partition walls of 
offices, exhibition stands etc. Although extensively used, these panels are not free 
from drawbacks, the foremost of which is the use of glass 
wool, which is a non-ecological and non-recyclable 
material. Other drawbacks observed with the use of these panels 
arise from the considerable thickness and high unit weight 
per unit surface (g/mÂ²) characterizing them. Another drawback is the need to make the installer 
assemble their components (usually three), with all the 
consequent problems. The aim of the present invention is to provide a 
panel, particularly for partition walls, that overcomes the 
drawbacks described above in known types. A consequent primary object is to provide a process 
that allows to manufacture the panel without particular 
technical problems and economically. Another important object is to provide a panel which 
is highly heat-resistant and highly sound-proofing in a 
limited thickness. Another object is to provide a panel which can be  
 
manufactured with conventional equipment and facilities. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a panel particularly 
for fireproof partition walls, characterized in that it 
comprises at least one sheet of corrugated cardboard 
between at least two sandwiches made of heat-bonded 
regenerated natural and/or synthetic textile fibers and/or 
made of heat-bonded synthetic and/or natural fibers having 
a porous structure; and by a process for manufacturing said 
panel, consisting in: 
-- compressing each sandwich while heat is applied; -- coupling the unit to said at least one central sheet of 
corrugated cardboard and/or one or more composite thermal 
insulation sheets by means of adhesives. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of two embodiments of the panel and of the 
operating steps of its manufacturing process, illustrated 
only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying 
drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a sectional view of a first embodiment of 
the panel; figure 2 is a sectional view of a second embodiment of
