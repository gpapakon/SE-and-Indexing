<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing adherence to the skin or 
eyelash of a skin care preparation containing an active 

ingredient by incorporating into the skin care preparation a 
film forming agent as an ingredient and applying the skin 

care preparation containing the active ingredient and the 
film forming agent to the skin. Our method is characterized 

by the film forming agent being a silicone pressure sensitive 
adhesive. Sunscreen preparations and eye cosmetics are 

described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to personal care and, 
more particularly, to skin care products including color 
cosmetics, which have been found to possess improved skin 
substantivity characteristics. Water and wear resistance are vital properties to 
skin protection products, since contact with water by 
perspiration and swimming, can destroy the effectiveness of 
an otherwise beneficial skin care product. Where greater 
protective qualities, high water resistance and substantive 
barrier characteristics, are desired in a skin care product, 
it is customary in the art to incorporate various organic 
waxes, organic resins and organic polymers, into the skin 
care product in order to achieve these goals. EP-A-0 521 647 describes a cosmetic composition for the 
treatment of areas around the eyes to reduce, or at least 
cover, facial lines and wrinkles. The cosmetic product 
described in this reference comprises:- 
(i) from about 1 to about 90% of a volatile 
silicone fluid; (ii) from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight of a 
non-volatile silicone gum; and (iii) from about 0.5 to about 50% of a C16 - C22 
fatty acid ester of citric acid. The citrate esters were found to be suitable for 
formulation with silicones to provide a clear composition 
with a slightly tacky feel.  
 What has been discovered in accordance with the 
present invention is that certain silicone based materials 
can be employed as viable alternatives to the organic waxes, 
resins and polymers, customarily used heretofore. 
Specifically, the silicone based material is a silicone 
pressure sensitive adhesive. The invention relates to a method of enhancing the 
adherence to the skin or eyelash of a personal care 
preparation containing an active ingredient. The method 
involves incorporating into the skin care preparation a film 
forming agent as an ingredient thereof and applying the skin 
care preparation containing the active ingredient and the 
film forming agent to the skin. The film forming agent 
according to the present invention is a silicone pressure 
sensitive adhesive.  
 The invention further relates to a sunscreen 
preparation containing a film forming agent and at least one 
ultraviolet light absorbing compound as an active ingredient. 
The invention is characterized by the use of a silicone 
pressure sensitive adhesive as the film forming agent in the 
sunscreen preparation. In addition, the invention relates to an eye 
cosmetic containing a film forming agent, a pigment, a wax, 
an oil and a preservative. Again, a silicone
