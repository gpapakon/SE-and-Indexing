<ABSTRACT>
A pouch (10) and coupler (16) which is used for administering medical products includes a fluid reservoir section (12) and a sterile section (14), with the coupler (16) positioned within the sterile section (14). The reservoir (12) being sealed such that the fluid cannot pass through the coupler (16). The coupler (16) including a projection (56) which extends through a seal (38) into the reservoir (12) so as to provide access through the coupler (16). The sterile section (14) being openable to provide access to the coupler (16) and provide a passage from the reservoir (12) through the coupler (16) to an administration set (50). In an alternative embodiment, the coupler (16) includes a projecting poppet (76) which extends through the coupler (16) so as to provide the fluid access.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pouch of the 
type used for retaining fluids, such as medical fluids 
for purposes of administration. The present invention 
includes an attachment structure for connecting with a 
fluid administration set and for transferring the liquid 
from within the pouch. The present invention may also 
include a coupler which is actuated by the attachment to 
the administration set. The present invention may also 
be used to accomplish the connection between the pouch 
and the administration set in a sterile manner. Medical fluids are often supplied to living 
organisms through an administration set which is 
connected to a source of the fluid through flexible tubing. 
Medical fluids are administered parenterally and 
enterally. The source of the various types of medical 
fluids typically includes a reservoir or the like having 
a tap which is mounted at the bottom end thereof such 
that when the reservoir is hung above the patient, a 
substantially constant supply and pressure is provided 
to the patient. Previously, reservoir units were made of glass 
and required sterilization. More recently, medical fluids 
have been prepared in advance and provided in sterile  
 
flexible pouches which are sealed during filling. Such 
pouches may be of the type which are prepared in a 
continuous automatic form/fill/seal machine such as those 
manufactured by Inpaco Corporation of Nazareth, 
Pennsylvania.  
 US-A-4 548 606 discloses an apparatus for administering fluid comprising a flexible 
pouch having at least one sealed fluid reservoir, an exhaust channel mandrel sealed 
to the pouch, means forming a seal between the reservoir and the exhaust channel 
and a coupler means movable within the exhaust channel between a first position 
and a second position.  
 In order to provide the connection between the 
sealed reservoir within the pouch and the intravenous 
syringe maintained within the patient's arm, a connection 
must be provided. It is contemplated that this connection 
must be maintained sterile. The combination of a 
fluid administration pouch and a sterile interconnection 
with a medical fluid administration set is a portion of 
the subject matter of the present invention. The present invention relates to a pouch and 
coupler of the type used for retaining and administering 
fluids. The pouch comprises a fluid reservoir section 
and a sterile section. The pouch preferably narrows at 
its lower end to form a channel. A coupler is sealed 
within the channel, forming the beginning of

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for administering fluids comprising: 

a flexible pouch (10; 10'; 10''), the pouch having a sealed fluid 
reservoir (12; 12'; 12'') and an exhaust channel (36; 36'; 36'') for the 

reservoir (12; 12'; 12''); 
means forming a seal (16, 38; 16', 38; 16'', 76) between the reservoir 
(12; 12'; 12'') and the exhaust channel (36; 36', 36''), the seal means 

comprising 

coupler means (16; 16', 16'') sealed within the exhaust channel (36; 
36', 36'') of the pouch (10; 10', 10''), at least a portion of the coupler 

means being moveable within the channel between a first sealed 
position and a second fluid passage position, the second position 

permitting fluid passage through the coupler from the reservoir, the 
opening of the seal being created by the movement of at least a 

portion of the coupler means into the reservoir. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the seal means (16; 
38; 16' 38) further comprises a peelable heat seal (38) formed in 

the pouch (10; 10'), the peelable seal (38) positioned at the communication 
between the reservoir (12; 12') and the exhaust channel (36; 

36'), the movement of the coupler means (16; 16') causing separation 
of the peelable seal (38). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the coupler 
means (16; 16') further comprises a projected end (56; 56') that 

moves into the reservoir (12; 12') in the second position.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the projected end (56) 
of the coupler means (16) further comprises projecting tabs (60, 62) 

that extend transversely into the reservoir (12) in the second position 
beyond the opening between the exhaust channel (36) and the 

reservoir (12). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the projected end (56') 
of the coupler means (16') further comprises an angle portion (68)
