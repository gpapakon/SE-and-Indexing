<ABSTRACT>
The fingerprint identification system involves using a compound prism with reflecting surface elements (14). The image of the finger (1) is directed onto a lens (7) and is focussed onto an optical sensor, e.g. a CCD array (8) that generates input to a processor (18) for identification. The readings of the fingerprint are taken when a pressure sensor (10) indicates a certain contact level has been attained. The processing cycle includes a comparison of the image intensity with a reference level.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the verification of finger prints, in
which a finger is placed on the image plane of a signal-relaying

optical component, the application pressure is

determined, and the finger-specific features are imaged on
an image recording sensor at least for individual edge

regions and/or central regions separately or at the same
time by means of a light source, wherein the image recording

is controlled 
via
 the application pressure, a threshold
value comparison and a control indication and, finally, an

analysis unit enables identification, and wherein:

a) application pressure and image recording are controlled
by one and the same signal processor unit (18),
b) the image recording is carried out at the application
pressure at which the width of the dark and light lines

of the finger print lie within a predetermined tolerance
and the analysis is carried out by the same signal

processor and
c) the same signal processor additionally compares the
image intensities with the threshold value when the

image is read out and only the beginning and end of the
light regions - having an intensity above the threshold

- are recorded in the pixel cycle.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the extents of the light regions of the finger print (15)

are determined from the image co-ordinates in a row 
direction (Z
1
 to Z
n
), in a columnar direction (S
1
 to S
n
) or in
lines (G
1
 to G
n
) at any angle (Fig. 4).
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that in
a row (Z
1
 to Z
n
) only the beginning and end of a light region
- for example, in the pixel cycle - are recorded.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a flash exposure is triggered at a

specific application pressure when video-standard CCD
cameras are used.
An arrangement for carrying out the method according to
claim 1 or any one of the subsequent claims, using a prism

onto which the finger in question is placed, pressure
sensors activated by the prism, a control indication for

monitoring the application pressure, and a light source by
means of which the finger-specific signals are imaged on an

image recording sensor, wherein:

a) a prism combination (2 to 5) in the form of a dovetail
prism is provided in place of the prism,
b) above a first short lateral face (4) of the dovetail
prism, a diffuser (4') is provided with a light source

(6) which is connected upstream in terms of function
and, in the region of the opposing second short lateral

face (5), the image recording sensor (8) is provided
with the optical imaging unit (7) which is connected

upstream thereof in terms of function, 
c) the mutually parallel sides of the dovetail prisms are
each covered, at least partially, with a reflective

plate (14) having defined absorption, and
d) a recess (17) adapted for placing the finger (1) is
provided in the top of the housing (9) surrounding the

arrangement.
