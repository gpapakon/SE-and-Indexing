<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a tile from a brittle material. The tile can be split up by breaking it into one or more smaller tiles. In the process, laser scoring in an individual tile of large dimensions produces:   a) parallel first predetermined breaking points in each case at a distance da, and b) parallel second predetermined breaking points in each case at a distance db, which intersect the first predetermined breaking points.   In this arrangement, a and b are integral numbers greater than 1. In the outer area at the distance da from the two outer first predetermined breaking points and at the distance db from the two outer second predetermined breaking points, the marginal zone is removed so that the remaining tile without marginal pieces (a-1) x (b-1) contains tile sections of the same size which are each defined by four predetermined breaking points.

Method for producing a plate from a brittle
material, which plate can be divided up by means of

breaking to form one or more smaller plates,
characterized in that


a parallel first predetermined breaking positions
each with a clearance d
a
, and
b parallel second predetermined breaking positions
each with a clearance d
b
,

are produced in a large size single plate by means of
laser notching, with the second predetermined breaking

positions intersecting the first predetermined breaking
positions, with a and b being whole numbers above 1,

the edge zone is removed in the outer region with
spacing d
a
 from the two outer first predetermined
breaking positions and with clearance d
b
 from the two
outer second predetermined breaking positions, with the

result that the remaining plate, without edge pieces,
contains 
(a-1) x (b-1)
 small plate sections of the same
size, which are limited by four respective

predetermined breaking positions.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that a rectangular plate is used and the first and the

second predetermined breaking positions are arranged in
such a way that they extend at right angles to each

other, so that the remaining plate is rectangular and
can be divided up into rectangular small plate sections

of the same size.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in
that ceramic material is used as the material of the

rectangular single plate.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that at least one hole is produced in the small plate 

sections of the remaining plate by means of laser
drilling.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in
that a recess is produced in the rectangular small

plate sections of the remaining plate by means of laser
cutting.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the edge zone is cut off by means of a laser.
Method for producing a plate from a brittle
material, which plate can be divided up by means of

breaking to form one or more smaller plates,
characterized in that


a parallel first predetermined breaking positions
each with a clearance d
a
 apart from in the edge
region, and
b parallel second predetermined breaking positions
each with a clearance d
b
 apart from in the edge
region,

are produced by means of laser notching in a large size
single plate with the second predetermined breaking

positions intersecting the first predetermined breaking
positions, with a and b being whole numbers above 1,

and with the plate being laser-notched to remove the
edge zone in such a way that with this outer laser

notching a spacing is maintained which is slightly
larger than the spacing d
a
 or d
b
, the edge zone produced
by means of laser notching is broken off and the broken

edges of the plate, produced upon the breaking-off, are
ground until the spacing from the next predetermined

breaking position amounts to exactly d
a
 or d
b
.
Method according to claim 7, characterized in
that at least three narrow recesses are formed by means 

of laser cutting at the outer predetermined breaking
positions produced by means of laser notching, at least

two of the recesses being arranged on the same side and
at least one being arranged on an adjacent side.
Method according to claim 8, characterized in
that the narrow recesses contact the outer

predetermined breaking positions from the outside, with
the predetermined breaking positions being produced by

means of laser notching.
Method according to claim 8, characterized in
that the central axes of the narrow recesses have the

same position as the outer predetermined breaking
positions produced by means of laser notching.
Method according to claim 1 or 7,
characterized in that a plurality of rectangular

plates, the edge zone of which produced by means of
laser notching has been broken off, are stacked on top

of each other in such a way that the contours of
corresponding narrow recesses lie on top of each other,

the stack is compressed and corresponding outer
contours of the rectangular plates are simultaneously

levelled by means of grinding.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the edge zone is sawn off, with the sawing-off a

clearance from the next predetermined breaking
positions, which corresponds to the clearance d
a
 or d
b
,
being maintained.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the plate remaining after the removal of the edge

zones is printed at least partially with metal paste
and baked.
