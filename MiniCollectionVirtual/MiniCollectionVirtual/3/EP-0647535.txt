<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting a 
deflated tyre on a vehicle suitable for cars, 
trucks or the like. Prior applications such as French Patent 
Publication No 2568519 and European Patent 
Publication No 291 217 propose using wheel speed 
signals from the vehicle wheels such as for example 
the signals from an anti-lock braking system which 
are multi-pulse signals of typically 48 to 96 
pulses per revolution of each wheel. The prior art 
system compares the speed derived signals in 
various ways, and also attempt to overcome errors 
due to vehicle factors such as cornering, braking, 
accelerating, uneven or changing loads, which can 
cause changes in the speed signals which are larger 
than those caused by a tyre deflation of for 
example 0.4 bar. French Patent Publication 2568519 avoided errors of 
this type by monitoring the speeds of the 
diagonally opposed pairs of wheels for a long time  
 
or distance period so that it averaged out 
effectively cornering of the vehicle. The result 
however was that the device operated very slowly 
taking many Kilometres to sense a pressure loss. European Patent Publication No. 291 217 improved the 
situation by calculating the lateral and 
longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle using the 
same four wheel speed signals and setting fixed 
limits above which the detection system was 
inhibited to avoid false signals due to cornering 
and acceleration. This inhibition of detection 
however meant that for a proportion of the time of 
vehicle running the system was not sensing 
punctures, the actual proportion depending upon the 
type of roads and the way the vehicle was being 
driven. European Patent Publication No. 552 827 discloses a further tyre 
pressure sensing system of this kind. The real difficulty with these types of systems is 
that, apart from the lateral acceleration of the 
vehicle which occurs during cornering causing 
increased deflection of the outer pair of wheels 
compared to the inner pair of wheels, each vehicle 
has different characteristics due to the position  
 
of the centre of gravity and the type of suspension 
and these different characteristics when cornering 
produce additional deflections in the outer pairs 
of tyres with regard to the inner pairs of tyres. However the vehicle characteristics make the tyre 
deflections different in each of the tyres. 
Similar problems occur due to vehicle 
characteristics in the deflections in the front 
pair of tyres compared to the rear pair when the 
vehicle brakes, and vice- versa
