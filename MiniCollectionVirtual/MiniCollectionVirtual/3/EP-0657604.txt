<ABSTRACT>
A drive-in ground socket with a drive-in peg (1), which is closed off by a dome-like carrying plate (4) and exhibits a central, axial thread-receiving means for the thread of a screw, and with a support (2) which is closed off by a dome-like footplate (11) and is intended for a post, there being provided, in the footplate (11), a through-passage (15) for the screw and a washer (18) which engages over this through-passage (15). The problem of the invention is to provide such a design of the drive-in ground socket that follow-up treatment of the nut thread is dispensed with and that unobstructed alignment of the inclination and of the vanishing line is ensured even after the post has been installed. The thread-receiving means (9), formed as a nut, is seated in a cage-like clearance (7) of the drive-in peg (1), and the support (2), which is designed as a sleeve (10), exhibits a slit (14) which is level with the head of the screw (16).

<CLAIMS>
A hammer-in ground holder having a hammer-in spike 
which is terminated by a dome-shaped supporting plate and 

which has a central axial threaded receiver for a thread of 
a screw, and having a support, terminated by a dome-shaped 

base plate, for a post, a passage for the screw and a disc 
reaching over the passage being provided in the base plate, 

characterized in that the threaded receiver, which is 
constructed as a nut, is seated in a recess (7) in the 

hammer-in spike (1), and in that the support (2), which is 
constructed as the holder (10), has a slot (14) at the 

level of the head of the screw (16). 
A hammer-in ground holder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the nut is constructed as a plate (8) 

and the wing (2) lies in a cross-shaped slot (7). 
A hammer-in ground holder according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the slot (14) at the base of the wall 

(13) of the holder (10) is constructed as a cutout. 
A hammer-in ground holder according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the holder (10) is constructed as a 

four-sided holder, and in that the slot is cut out over the 
width of a wall (13). 
A hammer-in ground holder according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that flow outlets remain free in 

the corner regions at the base of the four-sided holder 
(10) opposite the base plate (11).
