<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a solid and integrated electrochemical sensor for measuring pH, consisting of a field-effect transistor, in which the drain and the source are each connected to at least one connection terminal (72, 73), to a supply and measurement circuit, via at least one conducting plug (6), characterised in that it has an elongate general shape; in that the connection terminals (72, 73) are arranged in an end region (Z) opposite the one (Z') containing the source (2), the drain (3) and the gate (4); in that it is lined, with the exception of the connection terminals and the selective gate, with an external protective layer; and in that the selected gate consists of a silicon oxynitride and/or nitride membrane, having a surface density of Si - NH2 sites lying between 2 and 8, preferably between 3 and 5, and even more preferably of the order of 4 micromoles x m
