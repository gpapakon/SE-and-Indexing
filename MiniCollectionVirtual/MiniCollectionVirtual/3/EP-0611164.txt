<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting a magnetic marker, such as 
an anti-pilferage marker, is disclosed, which method 

comprises simultaneously generating a relatively low 
frequency and a relatively high frequency magnetic 

field in a surveillance zone, and detecting the 
intermodulation products generated by a marker in 

response to the magnetic fields when the marker passes 
through the surveillance zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting a
marker within a predetermined zone and to a system for
carrying out the method. The invention is intended
primarily to be used in the detection of goods in
electronic article surveillance or anti-theft systems,
but it may be used for example in article tracking or
personnel detection systems.The invention concerns the detection of markers
which have specific non-linear characteristics. It is
exemplified in relation to high permeability
ferromagnetic markers, but it applies also to markers
which have non-linear electronic circuit components.Systems which are examples of this invention will
provide for the excitation and interrogation of
(receipt of information from) special markers, and the
systems give better distinguishability in detection of
these markers over commonplace 'false alarm' objects at
minimum system complexity and cost, when compared to
systems of the prior art. This leads to high positive
detection probability and low false alarm probability.The types of markers detected by these systems are
well known in the prior art. They are usually
ferromagnetic markers which have a very high magnetic
permeability and low coercivity. This means that they
exhibit magnetic saturation (and particularly a
reproducible non-linear magnetic response) at very low
levels of applied magnetic field (typically of order 1
Oersted). They are typically long narrow strips or
thin films of special high permeability magnetic
alloys.In systems which detect these markers, an
interrogating magnetic field is driven by a coil or set
of coils. This varying magnetic field produces a
varying state of magnetization in the marker which in 
turn re-emits a magnetic field. Because of the non-linearity
of the marker, the re-emitted field contains
frequency components such as harmonics and
intermodulation products which are not present in the
interrogating field. These components are detected by
a coil or set of coils to indicate the presence of the
marker.The detection is made difficult because many
commonplace objects are magnetic, such as tin cans,
keys, shopping trollies, etc. These also have
nonlinear characteristics of a greater or lesser
degree, and also give rise to varying amounts of the
new frequency components.Many systems of the prior art have used an
interrogating magnetic field of a single frequency f1,
and detected a harmonic component n.f1. In order to
discriminate between high-permeability markers and low-permeability
common objects, these systems have
detected
