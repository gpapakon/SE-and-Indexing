<ABSTRACT>
One embodiment example includes bus lines (LB') the length of which, between two successive points of contact (CO, C1) is greater than the width (d) of the gap between these two points of contact, by virtue of a castellated shape. Application to backplanes transmitting logic signals at high throughput.

<CLAIMS>
A device for limiting the impedance mismatch of a
point-to-multipoint link comprising bus lines (LB') printed on

a rigid insulative substrate and a plurality of electronic
circuit board connectors (S1, ..., S4) consisting of pins

(C1, ..., C4) when some boards are absent from the connectors;

   characterised in that the length of each portion
(L1, ..., L3) of bus line (LB') between two successive pins

(C1, C2) is greater than the width (d) of the space between
the two pins.
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that each
bus line (LB') is in the form of a series of crenellations

(L1, L2, L3).
