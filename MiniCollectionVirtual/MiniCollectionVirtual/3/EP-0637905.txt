<ABSTRACT>
Protective bellows (10) at the shaft end (2) of a rotating shaft comprising a connecting portion (14) attached to the annular bearing box of a stationary protective pipe (4) surrounding said shaft (1), said connecting portion (14) providing means (20) for detachably connecting a resilient bellows (11) to said connecting portion by means of a connecting ring (12) in order to achieve a complete covering of said shaft end (2). Through the device, the shaft end in its entirety will be protected in all situations, while permitting it to be detached for maintenance work by a single operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROTECTIVE BELLOWSThe present invention relates to a protective device for a cardan shaft of a transmission from a drive unit to a driven tool or machine, and particularly to a protective bellows, that covers the universal joint of such a cardan shaft. The protective bellows is meant to cooperate with a stationary protective pipe disposed around the rotating shaft, thereby providing an extension of the cardan shaft protection, that entirely covers the universal joints of the shaft ends up to the drive means or tool.Particularly in the field of agriculture,there is often a need to drive connected units such as manure-spreaders, self-loading wagons or a bale machines etc. by means of the tractor power take-off. This need may be frequent enough to call for numerous connecting and disconnecting operations of such units or tools in the course of the working-day. In order to drive the tool or machine, the rotating movement is transmitted from the tractor power take-off to the tool or machine by means of a shaft, that is displaceable in its length direction and provided with a universal joint at its two ends. The universal joint at the end facing the tractor will be pushed onto the power take-off spline shaft and axially locked, usually by means of a spring-loaded locking pin, that engages with a tangential groove on the splined shaft.The cardan shaft being coupled in this manner constitutes a serious risk of injuries, and demands are made in different places, e.g. by insurance companies and working environment orga¬ nizations, to prevent this risk by providing protective devices, that surround the rotating cardan shaft and the universal joint.Several attempts have been made in order to prevent this risk of injury, the Swedish patent No. 218479 describing a funnel-shaped or cylindrically shaped universal joint protection, which, according to a first embodiment yields to axial forces by means 

of a step-by-step tapered, connecting portion between the protective funnel and a protective tube supporting said funnel above the cardan shaft, said connecting portion being made in a flexible material or radially slitted. In a second embodiment, in which the protective funnel is not made in a resilient material, the funnel is axially displaceable by means of a helical spring, that is disposed inside the protective funnel. The spring, one end of which is attached to the protective tube and the other end of which is attached to openings in the envelope surface at the base of the conical funnel, pushes the funnel over the

CLAIMS
1. Protective device at the shaft end (2) of a rotating cardan shaft (1), comprising a resilient bellows (11), a connecting ring (12) with a centre opening (15) and axial grooves or openings (16, 17) fixed at one end of said bellow, a supporting ring (13) fixed at the other end of said bellow, a connecting portion (14) with a centre opening (8) and connecting means (20), as well as a protective pipe (4) formed with an annular bearing box (5), which engages with an annular groove (6) on the cardan shaft (1), characterized in that said connecting portion (14) is attached to the cardan shaft side of said shaft end (2) by presenting in its centre opening (18) a profile (18
1
), by means of which said connecting portion is in contact with said bearing box (5) and attaches thereto, in that the bellows (11) due to its length and resiliency under pressure contacts the wall at the power take-off of the drive device or the driven device by detachably connecting the connecting ring (12) through engagement between said grooves (16, 17) and the connecting means (20) to the connecting portion, and in that said protective device being attached in this manner makes the shaft end (2) accessible on one hand through compres¬ sion of the bellows (11) towards the shaft end (1) without disconnecting the connecting ring (12) from the connecting portion (14), on the other through the axial displacement of said bellows (11) over said shaft end (2) after the disconnecting of said connecting ring (12) from said connecting portion (14) for a total exposure of said shaft end (2).
2. Protective bellows according to claim 1, characterized in that said bearing box (5) is integrated with said connecting portion (14).
3. Protective bellows according to claim 1, characterized in that said connecting means (20) comprises pins (20), each provided with a head, said pins (20) constituting in cooperation with said grooves or openings (16, 17) of said connecting ring a bayonet-type quick coupling, which is secured in a rotational 


direction (B) opposed to the rotational direction (C) of said cardan shaft (1).
4. Protective bellows according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said bellows (11) is a helical rubber hose with steel wire reinforcements, or the like.
