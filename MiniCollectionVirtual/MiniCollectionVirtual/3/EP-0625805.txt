<ABSTRACT>
An alkaline secondary battery comprising a negative 
electrode comprising cadmium, zinc or iron or an oxide or 

hydroxide thereof or a hydrogen absorbing alloy, a positive 
electrode comprising a metal oxide or a metal hydroxide, and a 

separator, which are all impregnated with an electrolyte 
comprising an alkaline aqueous solution is disclosed, wherein 

the separator is made of a polyolefin fiber sheet which has a 
wicking rate of pure water of at least 10 mm per 2 minutes when 

one end of the sheet is dipped in pure water at 20°C and 60% 
RH. Since the separator is chemically stable and exhibits 

sufficient hydrophilic properties, the battery retains a high 
electrode utilization even at a high rate discharging and has 

a practically sufficient cycle life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a alkaline secondary
battery.A separator of alkaline secondary batteries is required
(1) to hold an alkaline electrolyte, (2) to separate a positive
electrode and a negative electrode, (3) to withstand winding
tension, (4) to cause no shortcircuit between positive and
negative electrodes, (5) to allow ions and water to migrate,
and (6) to allow gas produced to permeate.Conventionally used separators of alkaline secondary
batteries include polyamide nonwoven fabric and polyolefin
nonwoven fabric having been made hydrophilic by a chemical
treatment, grafting or application of a surface active agent
(see JP-A-58-94752, JP-A-61-78053, JP-A-64-86445, JP-A-2-291665,
and JP-A-4-167355, the term "JP-A" as used herein means
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").The FR-A-2504734 discloses a process for manufacturing of fiber-based
separators for battery cells, of which the hydrophilic electrolyte retention properties have
been improved by radio frequency plasma treatment of a fiber sheet in the presence of a
gas conferring oxygen groups under reduced pressure. The plasma treatment as
disclosed in this prior art document increases the O/C ratio in the separator fibers from
about 0.05-0.35.JP-A-4167355 and JP-A-56063771 disclose a separator sheet made of
polypropyrene fibers and a heat- and alkali-resistance alkaline storage battery.Polyamide nonwoven fabric, though excellent in
hydrophilic properties, undergoes hydrolysis in an alkaline
electrolyte, and the hydrolysis product reduces the capacity
retention during storage as pointed in H.W. Lim, et al.,
Proceedings of the 27th Power Sources Conference, pp. 83-85
(1976). Polyolefin nonwoven fabric endowed with hydrophilic
properties by a chemical treatment or grafting has become
brittle due to the treatment as reported in Mori, et al.,
KOBUNSHI RONBUNSHU, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 1-9 (Jan., 1991). As
a result, shortcircuits tend to occur during electrode winding
or on charging or discharging. Besides, an additional step is
required for disposal of the waste treating liquid.Polyolefin nonwoven fabric having been rendered
hydrophilic with a surface active agent has disadvantages that
the applied surface active agent is easily dissolved in the
electrolyte, resulting in a lowering of capacity retention
during storage as discussed in JP-A-64-57568 and that the
internal resistance of the battery tends to increase with
lowering of capability of holding the electrolyte, resulting in
a discharge voltage
