<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium includes in a magnetic film (5) 
first areas (39) containing magnetically pre-recorded 

readable data (17) and second areas (40) for magnetically recording 
and reading data (16). The first and second areas 

(39, 40) may co-exist in mixture and be defined at least

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording medium; to a method of producing such medium
and to an apparatus of magnetically recording and reading data on
the recording medium while a magnetic head is being subjected
to tracking control.Tracking control marks have not been necessary in a
conventional magnetic recording medium (magnetic disk) which
records digital information by a magnetic head because a
method has been employed which sufficiently reduces
eccentricity of the magnetic recording medium, sufficiently
increases a track width and improves accuracy of a mechanism
of a magnetic recording apparatus to reduce a relative
position error between the magnetic recording medium and the
magnetic head. In a magnetic reocording medium for recording
digital data, a magnetic film is sputtered onto a disk
substrate such as an aluminium substrate and initial
magnetization is effected. Then, the disk is individually
initialized by a servo writer or the magnetic head of the
magnetic recording apparatus.In order to accomplish a higher recording density by
reducing further a recording track width of a magnetic
recording medium, machining accuracy of the magnetic
recording medium and the mechanism of the magnetic recording
apparatus must be improved, but this results in the problems
that yield of the recording medium (magnetic disk)
drops, ultra-high precision machining is necessary 
for the mechanical components of the magnetic recording
apparatus and the magnetic recording apparatus thus
becomes too large in scale to achieve reasonable
stability and cost.Since it has not been possible conventionally
to replicate in advance fixed information specific
to a computer onto a magnetic disk, troublesome
procedures of purchasing beforehand software
recorded on a floppy disk and then transferring
the information from the floppy disk to a magnetic
disk have been necessary to replicate a personal
computer software. If the software is large in
scale, the number of floppy disks reaches some
dozens so that operability of the apparatus drops
and a user cannot use it so easily. Moreover, the
magnetic disk medium must be initialized individually
by a servo writer or a magnetic recording
apparatus after a magnetic film is sputtered onto
a disk substrate such as an aluminium substrate and
is magnetized initially. Therefore, it has been
difficult to replicate large quantities of magnetic
disk media having recorded information.On the other hand in a magnetic disk (floppy)
in which digital data are recorded by a magnetic
head

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic recording medium having a magnetic film (5)
for magnetically recording and reading data (16), comprising

first areas (39) containing magnetically readable pre-recorded
data (17) composed of preformed pits whose magnetic

characteristics are locally different from those of said magnetic
film and to be magnetically detected by magnetic flux distribution

occurring at the edges of said pits; and second
areas (40) for magnetically recording and reading data (16).
The recording medium of claim 1, wherein said first and
second areas (39, 40) co-exist in mixture and are defined at

least partly by radial division of a disk-shaped recording
medium.
The recording medium of claim 1 or 2, wherein said pre-recorded
data (17) are recorded in said first areas (39) by

removing partially said magnetic film (5).
The recording medium of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein a
large number of magnetically readable servo pits (3, 4) recorded

by partial removal of said magnetic film (5) are periodically
provided along a track (2, 2') and said pre-recorded

data (17) are provided between said servo pits (3, 4). 
The recording medium of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein a
large number of magnetically readable servo pits (3, 4)

recorded by partial removal of said magnetic film (5) are
periodically provided along a track (2, 2') and the portions

between said servo pits (3, 4) are used as second areas (40)
for magnetically recording and reading data (16).
A method of producing the magnetic recording medium (5)
of any preceding claim, using a mask (130) having a pattern

of pre-recorded pits (20) comprising:

exposing a resist (22) disposed on a magnetic film, whereby said film is for magnetically recording and reading data
(5) through said mask (130);
removing the exposed part of said resist (22) corresponding to said pattern;
and
modifying the magnetic characteristics of the portion of
said magnetic film (5) corresponding to said pattern using the remaining part of

said resist (22) as a mask to thereby preform magnetically readable pits (20) on first areas (39) and to leave second areas (40) for magnetically recording and reading data.
The method of claim 6, wherein said pits (20) are pre-formed
by removing the portions of said magnetic film (5)

corresponding to said pattern.
The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein said pits (20) are
preformed by converting the portions of said magnetic film

(5) corresponding to said pattern to a non-ferromagnetic
state. 
The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein said pits (20) are
preformed by local removal of a base film (32) below said

magnetic film (5) corresponding to said pattern.
A magnetic recording apparatus including a magnetic head
(10) for detecting a tracking signal by sensing the magnetic

field occurring at each of said preformed pits (20) formed on
the magnetic recording medium of any of claims 1 to 5, and

for magnetically recording data while controlling the recording
position of said magnetic head (10) by said tracking signal.
The recording apparatus of claim 10, wherein the length
of each of said preformed pits (20) in a direction transverse

to the data recording direction is substantially equal to the
width of the recording portion of said magnetic head.
