<ABSTRACT>
There are discolsed a pesticidal composition containing a water-insoluble 
alginate, which is prepared by treating a solid composition 

containing (a) a pesticidally active ingredient which is a pest-controlling 
active ingredient or a plant growth-regulating active 

ingredient and (b) an alginic acid or a water-soluble alginate with an 
aqueous solution containing a divalent or polyvalent cation which can 

convert said alginic acid or water-soluble alginate into a water-insoluble 
alginate. Also disclosed is a pesticidal composition 

containing a water-insoluble alginate, which is prepared by coating a 
solid substance containing the pesticidally active ingredient with a 

water-insoluble alginate. The composition of the invention has 
excellent sustained-release effects of the pesticidally active 

ingredient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pesticidal composition
wherein release of a pesticidally active ingredient which is a pest-controlling
active ingredient or a plant growth-regulating active
ingredient having a water solubility of not greater than 2000 ppm, is effectively controlled. The invention also relates to
a method for preparing such a pesticidal composition and use of the
same.A variety of pesticides have been developed and used in many
fields. Sustained release of a pesticidally active ingredient from a
pesticidal composition into soil, water, or another specific
environment allows sustainable effects of the pesticide on target pest
and reduces the phytotoxicity of the composition on plants.
Irrespective of wide researches and investigations, however, any
method of realizing sufficiently sustained release of a pesticidally
active ingredient has not been found yet.WO-A-91/01803 discloses multilayer granules containing coated active substances,
as well as a production method, a device for implementing such method and
utilization of the obtained granules. The granules of WO-A-91/01803 are each
comprised of a coated core, and are characterized in that the coating is comprised
of two layers, the layer closer to the core (first layer) not providing by itself around
the core a unique layer, autonomous and/or capable of keeping its properties, and
the layer situated immediately after (second layer) being a protection layer.Moreover, A. B. Pepperman et al. describe alginate controlled release formulations
of metribuzin, especially the release rate of metribuzin from various alginate-clay
formulations (Journal of Controlled Release1991, 17, 105-112).In US-A-4,401,456 and US-A-4,400,391 alginate gel beads containing bioactive
materials dispersed therein are disclosed. Those beads may be made to either
float or sink in aqueous environments, and are said to be capable of providing the
controlled release of their bioactive materials when applied to terrestrial or aqueous
environments.It is the object of the present invention to provide a
pesticidal or plant growth regulating composition having
sufficiently sustained release of the active ingredient.This object could be achieved on the basis of the
finding that a pesticidal or plant growth regulating
composition containing a water-insoluble alginate can
control release of the active ingredient contained in the
composition, and has excellent sustained-release effects. The invention is directed to a pesticidal or plant
growth regulating composition containing
a
