<ABSTRACT>
A thermosetting printing ink composition comprising 
a functional copolymer of a thermosettable polyester and 

a polysiloxane, a pigment, a crosslinking agent and a 
curing catalyst which may be a strong acid or a metal 

salt thereof. The composition desirably also includes a 
reactive diluent such as a glycol, glycol ether or 

alcohol. The compositions are especially useful for 
imprinting metal containers such as beer and soda cans.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermosetting printing ink
compositions which are especially useful for imprinting
metal containers such as beer and soda cans. The
composition comprises a functional copolymer of a
thermosettable polyester and a polysiloxane, a pigment, a
crosslinking agent and a catalyst which may be a strong
acid or a metal salt thereof. The composition desirably
also includes a reactive diluent and one or more
conventional fillers.Thermosetting coating compositions containing one or
more thermosettable polyesters, an aminoplast resin
crosslinking agent and a curing catalyst consisting of a
strong acid are well known. Such prior art compositions
maybe used as printing inks by incorporating pigments
and appropriate solvents therein. It has now been found
that if a functional, i.e. reactive, copolymer of a
thermosettable polyester and a type of polysiloxane is
used instead of the polyester, the resultant ink
composition possesses improved pigment wetting, reduced
initial shear viscosity, lower contact angle and lower
surface tension. The printing ink compositions of the
present invention also exhibited improved transfer and
laydown, higher gloss and increased color strength.U.S. Patent 4,370,441 discloses a coating
composition containing three components: an essentially
nonfunctional organic solvent-soluble silicone resin
reaction product of a highly branched, low molecular
weight hydroxy-functional polyester with an hydroxy or
alkoxy-functional polysiloxane; a second component 
consisting of an organic solvent-soluble, essentially
linear, low molecular weight, hydroxy-functional
polyester and a heterocyclic aminoplast resin for curing
the second component.The compositions of the aforesaid '441 patent are
prepared such that, upon curing, no significant
combination of the nonfunctional polyester-silicone
reaction product with either the reactive polyester or
the aminoplast resin will occur, i.e. stratification of
the coating will occur and the silicone will rise to the
coating surface to provide the desired weather
resistance. In contrast thereto, the compositions of the
present invention are prepared such that the polyester-silicone
copolymer is functional, i.e. reactive in
nature, and such copolymer will combine with the
crosslinking agent.The thermosetting printing ink compositions of the
present invention comprise:
(a) a functional copolymer of a thermosettable
polyester and a polysiloxane having the general formula:
 
wherein x is an integer having a value of 0 to 250
and y is an integer
