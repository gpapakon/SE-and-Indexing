<ABSTRACT>
An electret filter made of a resin whose angle of 
contact upon wetting with pure water is no smaller than 95 

degrees, as well as an electret filter made of a resin 
whose angle of contact upon wetting with pure water has 

been adjusted to no smaller than 95 degrees by addition of 
silicone oil. Those electret filters have high trapping 

efficiency and their ability to trap particulates, 
especially cigarette smoke, will not deteriorate even if 

they are continuously used. Therefore, they can 
advantageously be used as filter media in many applications 

such as home and industrial air conditioners, air cleaners, 
fan heaters, vacuum cleaners, and air conditioning systems 

for common equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electret filters, more
particularly, to electret filters that have high trapping
capability, with the added advantage that their ability to
trap cigarette smoke is retained in a consistent manner.Electret filters are used as filter media in many
applications such as home and industrial air conditioners,
air cleaners, vacuum cleaners, fan heaters and air
conditioning systems for common equipment to clean ambient
atmospheres by trapping the dust, smoke and other particulate
contaminants. Such electret filters are conventionally
prepared from nonwoven fabrics of polymers such as
polypropylene by processing them into electrets.
For example, FR-A-2357998 describes a method of preparing
electret tapes made of various polymers such as
polyethyleneterephthalate.
However,
the conventional electret filters have had the problem that
they are not highly suitable for adsorbing cigarette smoke
since their ability to trap it will drop markedly with the
amount of adsorption and cannot be retained in a consistent
manner.The present invention has been achieved under these
circumstances and has as an object providing an electret 
filter whose ability to trap particulates, especially
cigarette smoke, will not deteriorate even if it is
continuously used and which hence is capable of retaining the
satisfactory trapping performance in a consistent manner.
Having this advantage, the electret filter of the present
invention is suitable for use as a filter medium in
air conditioners, air cleaners and other applications.Cigarette smoke as suspended matter in air consists of
liquid particles. When such liquid smoke particles are
deposited on the surface of a filter, they cover the fibrous
surfaces of the filter and interfere with the action of
electric charges that have been formed on the surface of the
filter as a result of processing into an electret. This
would probably contribute to a sudden drop in the ability of
the electret filter to trap cigarette smoke.Under the circumstances, the present inventor conducted
intensive studies in order to obtain a filter which, unlike
the conventional filters, would not experience a sudden drop
in its ability to trap cigarette smoke. As a result, the
present inventor found that this object
can be achieved by an electret filter that is made 
of a resin whose angle of contact upon wetting with pure
water
has been adjusted to no smaller than 95
degrees by addition of silicone oil.In a preferred embodiment, the silicone oil may be added
in an amount of 0.05-5 wt%.Fig.
