<DESCRIPTION>
Applicants' invention relates generally to electrical
control mechanisms and more particularly to a network of
single point input and output devices serially connected to
programmable logic controllers or other types of
microprocessor based devices that perform a number of
control functions.This application is related to the following, commonly
assigned applications filed concurrently herewith, entitled
"A Synchronous Serial Communication Network for Controlling
Single Point I/O Devices" (WO-A-93/13484, Our Docket AP-46);
"Apparatus for Receiving And Decoding A Serial Data
Packet Containing The Status Of A Network of Single Point
I/O Devices" (WO-A-93/13633, Our Docket AP-48) and
"Apparatus For Receiving And Modifying A Serial Data Packet
From A Communications Network To Indicate Its Status" (WO-A-93/13608,
Our Docket AP-49).Input and output control modules for interfacing with
a programmable logic controller (PLC) that is normally used
to control a number of functions in a manufacturing
operation are well known. In most instances, these control
module assemblies are electrically interconnected in a rack
assembly with the PLC. This assembly is often of necessity 
located on the plant floor at a distance from the machinery
used in the manufacturing operation to prevent physical
abuse from dirt, moisture, or vibration. Since many of the
switches, pilot lights, control relays and so on are
located on the machinery, considerable wiring is required
to connect these devices to the PLC since each device
requires at least two wires between it and its respective
I/O point.Remote I/O control modules are available that can be
located in a rack assembly mounted directly on the
machinery. Whereas this will reduce the wiring
requirements, the additional rack assembly will require
adding a power supply and a remote network interface module
(NIM) that could be more costly. These assemblies are
generally bulky and require mounting space that may not be
available. Each device will still require a direct
connection to the remote I/O control module.The host PLC will also require a local NIM
Communications between the local and remote NIMs can become
complicated. Each device has an unique address. There
must be a means for each I/O point to know and set its
address location so that it can decode and select the data
meant for it from the various data packets sent over the
communication link by the PLC. It must also be able to
mark its data with its identity when it is being sent back
to the PLC. With very large systems,
