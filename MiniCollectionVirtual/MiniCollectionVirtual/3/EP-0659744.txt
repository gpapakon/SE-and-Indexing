<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes two industrial processes for the preparation of heterocyclic 7-membered ring ketones by means of Dieckmann condensation with avoidance of the customary dilution method. In addition, the otherwise customary high excesses of base are distinctly reduced and the reaction times are significantly shortened. In one process the 1,8-dicarboxylic acid ester is added to the recirculated reaction mixture in the region of a jet, in the other the 1,8-dicarboxylic acid ester is added to the top of a packed column and diluted along the column by means of the condensate from the reaction mixture boiling under reflux in the column. The yields achieved by these procedures are 80-89% of theory. The distinctly improved yields allow the synthesis of azelastine (INN) and flezelastine (INN) in increased total yield, the final reaction to the end product being carried out in water instead of in organic solvent. Reaction in water gives yields of 70-90% of theory.

)-alkylphenyl and salts thereof, by means of the
Dieckmann condensation using strong bases in inert

solvents, characterised by the following features:

a) that an excess of up to a maximum of 20% of
strong bases is used
b) that the condensation reaction is carried out
over reaction times of from 1 to 6 hours,

preferably from 1 to 3 hours
c) that the operation is conducted using
concentrations of from 0.1 to 1.5 mol, preferably

0.3 to 0.9 mol, of the undiluted dicarboxylic
ester flowing in to be condensed, per litre of

solvent
d) that, avoiding the conventional dilution
technique, either

   the reaction is carried out in a closed device,
with the dissolved base being circulated and the

undiluted dicarboxylic ester being charged into
the circulation system by means of a jet nozzle,

or
 
   that the ascending condensate formed is used

simultaneously in a packed column for the
dilution and heating of the undiluted

dicarboxylic ester introduced at the top of the
column.
