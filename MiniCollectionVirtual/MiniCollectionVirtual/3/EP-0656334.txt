stream containing hydrogen and a hydrogenatable material 

comprising a dialkyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate at an inlet

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of cyclohexanedimethanol, and more particularly
to a process for the production of a mixture containing a
major amount of the trans-isomer of cyclohexanedimethanol
and a minor amount of the corresponding cis-isomer.1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is used to prepare highly
polymeric linear condensation polymers by reaction with
terephthalic acid and is useful as an intermediate in the
preparation of certain polyester and polyester amides. The
use of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol for such purposes is
disclosed in, for example, US-A-2901466. This document
teaches that the trans-isomer of polycyclohexylenedimethylene
terephthalate has a higher melting point range
(315°-320°C) than the corresponding cis-isomer (260°-267°C).One method for preparing 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol
(hexahydroterephthalyl alcohol) involves the hydrogenation
of diethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (diethyl
hexahydroterephthalate) in a slurry phase reactor in the
presence of a copper chromite catalyst at a pressure of 3000
psia (about 206.84 bar) and a temperature of 255°C, as is
described in Example 3 of US-A-2105664. The yield is said
to be 77.5%.The hydrogenation of dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate
(DMCD) to 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) is
shown below in equation (1):-

The two geometrical isomers of CHDM thus produced are: 
The resulting 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol product is
a mixture of these two isomers which have different melting
points. As reported on page 9 of the book "Fiber Chemistry"
edited by Menachem Lewis and Eli M. Pearce, published by
Marcel Dekker, Inc.: "Both the alicyclic ester [i.e.
dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate] and the alicyclic
diol [i.e.1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol] exist in two isomeric
forms, cis ... and trans ..., that are not interconvertible
without bond rupture". The passage continues later:
"Control of the [cis-:trans-] ratio is important [in 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol]
since many polymer and fiber
properties depend on it".The cis-isomer of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol has a
melting point of 43°C and the trans has a melting point of
67°C. The higher melting point trans-isomer is often
preferred over the cis-isomer for use as a reagent in the
preparation of polyester and polyester-amides if a high
melting point for such materials is considered desirable.
As noted above, the trans-isomer of a typical polyester,
such as trans-polycyclohexylmethyl terephthalate, has a
higher melting point than the cis-isomer. Hence, for
example, US-A-5124435 discloses a
