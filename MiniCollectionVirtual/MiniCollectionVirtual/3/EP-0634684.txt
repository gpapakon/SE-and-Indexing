<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetooptical
element for use as an optical isolator in an optical
amplifier or the like and, more particularly, to a
magnetooptical element which is suitable for use in a
wavelength range between 0.8 micrometer and 1.1
micrometers. This invention relates furthermore to an
optical isolator in which the magnetooptical element is
used as a Faraday rotator.A travelling-wave optical amplifier of a 1.5-micrometer
band with an Er (erbium) added optical fibre
has a high efficiency, no polarization dependency, and
an excellent feature of match with a transmission system.
Its practical application to excitation of laser diodes
(hereafter LD) of a 0.98-micrometer and 1.48-micrometer
bands has vigorously been studied. As a result of
experimental studies of signal-to-optical gain and noise
characteristics, it is already known that higher-efficiency
and lower-noise characteristics are achieved by the
excitation in the 0.98-micrometer band than the
excitation in the 1.48-micrometer band. Development is, 
however, currently in progress as regards an optical
amplifier comprising an optical device (as, for example,
an optical isolator) suitable in the 1.48-micrometer
band.As a 0.98-micrometer optical isolator, optical
isolators are in practical use at present with use of a
terbium-gallium-garnet (TGG) single crystal. They are
too bulky as compared with an LD and are not studied for
future points of view. Bulk yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG)
and Bi-substituted garnet are highly absorbing at the
0.98-micrometer band and are not practical because of an
insertion loss of about 5 dB. It has been confirmed that
Cd1-xMnxTe is a material having a great Verdet constant
and is confirmed to exhibit a practical performance as a
material for optical isolators of visible wavelengths of
0.85 to 0.63 micrometer when Mn is substituted for a part
of Cd of CdTe of a ZnS crystal structure (Onodera and
Oikawa, the 15-th Scientific Lecture Proceedings of the
Applied Magnetism Institute of Japan, 30aB-7, page 179
(1991)).The Verdet constant is, however, too small at
0.98 micrometer and has made it difficult to use in
practice. This has been a main reason of a delay in
development of an optical isolator for 0.98-micrometer
band excitation of LD-moduled optical amplifier despite
its intrinsically higher efficiency and lower noise
characteristics than 1.48-micrometer band excitation. From JP 61-123814 A or from JP 3-229217 A magnetooptical elements
of the general sum formular Cd1-x-yMnxHgyTe are known. In particular,
