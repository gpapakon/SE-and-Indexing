<ABSTRACT>
A paper coating composition comprises (I) a pigment, 
(II) an aqueous binder, and (III) a water-soluble resin 

obtained by the reaction of at least (a) an alkylenediamine 
or a polyalkylenepolyamine, (b) a urea compound, and (c) a 

compound selected from aldehydes, epihalohydrins, and is 
further improved by incorporating therein (IV) a compound 

selected from (f) amines selected from monoamines, diamines 
and their salts each having at least 4 carbon atoms, (g) 

quaternary organic ammonium salts, and (h) polyamides 
obtained by the reaction between a dibasic carboxylic 

compound and a polyamine. The water-soluble resin of the 
component (III) may be further allowed to react with a 

dibasic carboxylic compound, and alicyclic amine and/or an 
alicyclic epoxy compound in addition to the above three 

ingredients (a)-(c). Paper coated by using the above 
composition has excellent ink-receptivity and water-resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper coating
composition, and more particularly to a composition imparting
excellent printing quality and excellent printing results
to paper.The term "paper" as used herein should be interpreted
in its broad sense, and includes paper in the narrow
sense, as well as paperboard.Coated paper obtained by applying a paper coating
composition mainly composed of a pigment and an aqueous
binder on to paper, followed by the necessary steps, such as
drying and calendering, has been widely used for commercial
printing, magazines, books and the like due to its excellent
properties, such as the printed results. With the increasing
demand for higher quality and the development of high-speed
printing techniques, constant efforts have continued further
to improve the coated paper quality. Particularly in the
art of offset printing, which predominates in the various
printing techniques, it is an important matter to improve
ink receptivity taking into account the effects of damping
water, water resistance such as wet pick, and anti-blister
properties when used on a rotary press.In order to resolve the above-mentioned problem, it
is conventionally known to add a wet strength agent or
printing quality improver including melamine-formaldehyde 
resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, or polyamidepolyurea-formaldehyde
resins, such as those disclosed in, for
example, JP-B-69-11667 and JP-B-84-32597 (the term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined published Japanese patent
application (KOKOKU)") to the paper coating composition.EP 0 081 994 describes a paper coating composition
comprising a conventional pigment, binder and water together
with a thermosetting resin aqueous solution prepared by mixing or reacting
(a) an alkylene diamine or polyalkylene polyamine with (b)
an epihalohydrin and (y) a water-soluble resin obtained by
reacting (i) urea, (ii) polyalkylenepolyamine and (iii) a
dibasic carboxylic acid and reacting the resultant
polyamidopolyurea with formaldehyde.Although these conventional wet strength agents or
printing quality improvers exhibit effective
characteristics, each of them has a serious defect or
inadequacy with respect to some of the desired
characteristics, and is not always satisfactory for
practical use.For example, aminoplast resins, such as melamine-formaldehyde
resins and urea-formaldehyde resins, not only
cause evolution of formaldehyde from the coating line or
resulting coated paper, but also produce substantially no
effect on improving ink receptivity and
