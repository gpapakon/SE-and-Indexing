<ABSTRACT>
Described is a double-turret tool holder for a lathe, the tool holder having two turret discs (16, 18) mounted coaxially to each other and connected so that they rotate in unison. The two discs can be continuously displaced relative to each other along their longitudinal axis by a control drive (44) and can be clamped at any required relative longitudinal positions. In order to be able to machine workpieces (14) on both sides with rotational tools, e.g. grinding wheels (28, 30), longitudinally aligned tool-clamping devices (24, 26) are rotatably mounted at at least one point on the circumference of the turret discs (16, 18), the tool-clamping devices being coupled to each other by a drive shaft (46) passing through the turret discs.
