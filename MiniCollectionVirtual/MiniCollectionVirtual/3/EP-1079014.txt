<ABSTRACT>
A drum type washing machine includes an outer cabinet (1),
a water tub (8) elastically mounted in the cabinet (1), a drum

type rotating tub (14) provided in the water tub (8) so as to
be rotatable about a horizontal axis, and an electric motor (33)

provided on a rear wall (27) of the water tub (8) to directly
drive the rotating tub (14). A distance between a portion of

the rear wall (27) of the water tub (8) on which the motor (33)
is provided and a rear wall (4) of the cabinet (1) is larger than

a distance between another portion of the rear wall (27) of the
water 
tub (8) and the rear wall (4) of the cabinet (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drum type washing machine including an outer cabinet and a water tub suspended from elastic supporting mechanisms in the cabinet.FIG. 14 illustrates one of conventional drum type washing machines. The illustrated washing machine comprises an outer cabinet 101 and a water tub 102 elastically supported on a plurality of suspension mechanisms in the cabinet. A rotating tub 104 is provided for rotation about a horizontal axis in the water tub 102. A bearing housing 106 is mounted on the rear of the water tub 102. A bearing 107 is provided in the bearing housing 106. The rotating tub 104 has a rotational shaft 105 supported on the bearing 107. A driven pulley 108 is mounted on the rotational shaft 105.An electric motor 109 is provided on a lower portion of the water tub 102. The motor 109 includes a rotational shaft 109a on which a driving pulley 110 is mounted. A transmission belt 112 extends between the pulleys 110 and 108. The pulleys 108 and 110 and the belt 112 constitute a belt transmission mechanism 111. In the above-described construction, torque developed by the motor 109 is transmitted via the belt transmission mechanism 111 to the rotating tub 104 so that the tub is rotated.In the drum type washing machines such as described above, vibration or oscillation generally tends to be produced during a dehydrating or spinning operation since laundry stuck to the inner circumferential face of the rotating tub 104 is raised against gravity. For reduction in the vibration, counterbalances 113 and 114 are mounted on upper and lower front portions respectively so that load is uniformly applied to the suspension mechanisms 103 and so that weight distribution with respect to the centre of rotation of the rotating tub 104 is well balanced.However, an amount of load received by each suspension mechanism 103 is varied due to an amount of the laundry accommodated in the rotating tub or the weight distribution with respect to the centre of rotation during the washing or dehydrating operation. As a result, a sufficient amount of vibration due to rotation of the rotating tub 104 cannot be reduced. Thus, a further improvement is desired.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a drum type washing machine in which the vibration due to rotation of the rotating tub can effectively be reduced.US Patent 3509742 discloses a drum type washing machine with elastic supporting elements, according to the pre-characterising portion of Claim 1.In order to reduce the amount of
