<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a material bearing zwitterionic groups, such as phosphoryl choline groups, which comprises treating at least the surface of a substrate with a solution or dispersion of a polymer grafted with zwitterionic groups, and material produced by the method. The method is suitable for producing materials for use in contact with blood and in particular a regenerated cellulose membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PRODUCING ANTI-THROMBOGENIC MATERIALAND MATERIAL PRODUCED THEREBY The present invention relates to a method of producing a material having improved anti-thro ogenicity, to certain materials produced thereby and in particular a regenerated cellulose membrane which is particularly suitable for use in artificial kidneys . The invention further provides a device such as a contact lens , biomedical or blood-contacting device or filtration membrane comprising such a material . At present, methods for prolonging the lives of patients with chronic renal insufficiency include blood dialysis, blood filtration and other blood-purification methods. In Japan, more than 100,000 patients are treated with such blood-purification methods.The principles of blood purification involve bringing the blood and a dialysate into contact via a membrane, allowing the diffusion of the waste products and the metabolic products contained in the blood into the dialysate and their subsequent removal, and removing the water surplus by taking advantage of the pressure differences.As is generally known, regenerated cellulose membranes, especially cellulose membranes regenerated by the copper ammonium method, arc commonly used in the method of artificial dialysis in particular; with progress in dialyzers and dialysis techniques, they have come to play an important role in the life prolongation and social recovery of patients with renal insufficiency; this is because the regenerated cellulose membrane is characterized not only by a superior dialysis capacity and mechanical strength, but also by high safety confirmed by years of experience.Despite the progress in dialysis methods, however, various problems associated with dialysis have still remained unsolved. One of these is the problem of various side effects which are believed to result from the long-term administration of high doses of anticoagulants.Currently, in cases in which aπificial dialysis is conducted, anticoagulants such as heparin are continuously administered in order to suppress the blood clotting reaction in the artificial dialyzer. Despite current improvements in the removal of solute in aπificial dialyzers, as well as the possibility of achieving long-term life prolongation of up to 20 years, a number of problems caused by the use of heparin have been pointed out continuously. In paπicular, it has become apparent that long-term administration of heparin produces in patients side effects such as liver.
