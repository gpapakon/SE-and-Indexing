<ABSTRACT>
The solid bed reactor (1), for microbial degrading and/or conversion of a substrate soiled by organic matter, has one or more eddy chambers (11) in the container (2) with a carrier medium (21) flowing vertically through. The carrier medium (21) is delivered into an eddy chamber (11) in a fluid stream (S).

<CLAIMS>
A fixed-bed reactor (1) for the microbial decomposition and/or microbial
transformation of organically polluted substrates, comprising at least a holding

container (2) and a carrier medium (21) in which the bacteria live which is
poured into the holding container (2) and through which the fluid to be cleaned

can flow, with one or more swirl chambers (11) arranged in the holding
container (2) such that the carrier medium (21) can flow through the swirl

chambers (11) vertically and, in a preferred embodiment, the swirl chambers
(11) are formed by upright pipes (12) arranged centrally in the holding

container (2),
characterized in that
,

the carrier medium (21) can be conveyed to each swirl chamber (11) by
means of a jet of fluid (S) in such a way that an injector nozzle (17, 17') is

arranged in the carrier medium (21, 21') before the swirl chamber (11) and the
injector nozzle (17, 17') can direct the jet of fluid (S) into the swirl chamber

(11), and that the jet of fluid (S) is taken from the cleaned fluid (22, 22').
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with Claim 1,
characterized in that
,

the fluid (22, 22') flowing through the carrier medium (21, 21') can be supplied
to the injector nozzle (17, 17') via a pipe (18, 18') provided with a controllable

feed pump (19, 19'), with this feed operating, in a preferred embodiment,
pulse-by-pulse or at adjustable time intervals.
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with Claim 1,
characterized in that,

the swirl chambers (11) are arranged in the holding container (2) in such a
way that their inlet opening (14, 14') is located in the carrier medium (21, 21')

and their outlet opening (15, 15') is located in the fluid (22, 22') which has
flowed through the carrier medium (21, 21').
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that,

the swirl chamber (123) is provided with inserts in the form of webs, perforated
plates or the like in order to deflect the flow.
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that,

the carrier medium (21) in the bottom part of the holding container (2) is
poured into the holding container (2) and the injector nozzle (17) is arranged

below the swirl chamber (11).
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that,

the carrier medium (21') is provided in the bottom part of the holding container
(2) and the injector nozzle (17') is arranged above the swirl chamber (11).
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that,

the holding container (2) is provided with an inlet pipe (7, 7') in order to feed in
the substrate and, in a preferred embodiment, the inlet pipe (7, 7') emerges

into the vertically lower area of the carrier medium (21, 21').
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with Claim 7,
characterized in that,

the inlet pipe (7") for feeding the substrate into the holding container (2) is
directly connected to the injector nozzle (17') or to the feed pipe (18') for the

injector nozzle (17').
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that,

the holding container (2) has a truncated conical base (3) and an unloading
opening (4) is provided in this base (3) which can be opened as an option.
The fixed-bed reactor in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that,

the holding container (2) has an overflow pipe (9) which, in a preferred
embodiment, is provided with a siphon (10) or the holding container (2) has an 

outflow pipe (9') equipped with a shut-off valve (10') in order to remove the
cleaned fluid (22, 22').
