<ABSTRACT>
A video image signal input apparatus of the present 
invention is capable of deciding whether the apparatus of 

the other party of communication is a normal telephone 
apparatus or facsimile equipment by the operator who 

hears the data received from a connected communication 
medium or automatically by analysis of the procedure of 

controlling the communication with the apparatus of the 
other party, and transmitting the data obtained by 

photographing a subject in accordance with the 
communication specification corresponding to the 

apparatus decided, as well as receiving the data from the 
apparatus of the other party in accordance with the 

communication specification corresponding to the 
apparatus decided and displaying the data on a display 

unit. The apparatus is also capable of visual telephone 
communication with a video image signal input set and facsimile 

communication with facsimile terminal equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video image signal
input apparatus which is capable of supplying image data
relating to a video image to various types of apparatuses.Conventional video image signal input apparatuses are
capable of converting a video image signal obtained from a
camera or the like into digital image data which are to be
supplied to an apparatus for processing the image data.However, since the specifications of such image data
processing apparatuses, as for example computers,
significantly differ from each other, the image signal of
conventional video image signal input apparatuses has to be
further processed in order to be editable by various types of
image data processing apparatuses. In the Article "A Video Conference Terminal with Multipoint
Capability" by L. Chiariglione et al, disclosed in IEEE
GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, Vol. 1, November 28,
1983, San Diego, CA, pages 562 to 566, an electric video
image signal input apparatus is described, comprising input
means, converting means and storage means. Furthermore, a
moving video coder and a still image coder are provided for
coding the converted digital video signal, wherein the
moving video coder is used for moving video signals and the
still image coder for still image signals. Thus, the data
format is defined by the type of input image signal of the
apparatus.Furthermore, an image signal input apparatus is disclosed
in ELECTRONICS, Vol. 58, No. 33, August 1985, New York,
USA, pages 34 to 36, wherein an input video signal is
digitized and supplied to a digital video system RAM. The
stored digital video signal is connected via a digital
video system interface to a transmission line compatible
with the NATIONAL TELEVISION STANDARDS COMMITTEE'S STANDARD
RS-170 and via a telephone interface to a usual telephone
line. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
an improved video image signal input apparatus which is
capable of providing an image signal directly editable by
various types of image processing apparatuses.This object is achieved by an improved video signal image
input apparatus as claimed in claim 1.Accordingly, since the video image signal input apparatus is
provided with a format selection means for selecting one of
plural kinds of data formats each of which respectively 
corresponds to one of plural types of apparatuses, it is
possible to adapt the video image signal to various types of
image processing apparatus into which the video image signal
is to be input. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of
