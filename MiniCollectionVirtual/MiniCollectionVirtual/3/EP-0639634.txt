A colloidal product containing sulfur, nitrogen and at least one of calcium
or magnesium, obtained by at least partial neutralization of the basicity reserve of at

least one of an overbasic sulfonate, phenate or salicylate having at least one of
calcium or magnesium carbonate dispersed within micelles therein, said neutralization

being by at least one dicarboxylic acid of formula I:


wherein a is each independently, a whole number from 1 to 8, x and z are each
independently a number from 1 to 4, y is a whole number from 0 to 4 and n is 1 or 2.
A colloidal product according to claim 1, wherein in formula (I), each a is
independently 1 or 2, x and z are each independently 1 or 2, and y is zero or 1.
A colloidal product according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the dicarboxylic acid
of formula I is:


3,3'-(1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(3-thiapropanoic) acid;
4,4'-(1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(4-thiabutanoic) acid;
4,4'-(1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(3,4-dithiabutanoic) acid;
5,5'- (1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(4,5-dithiapentanoic) acid;
bis(3-(5-thio-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-3-thiapropanoic) acid;
or bis(4-(5-thio-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-4-thiabutanoic) acid.
A colloidal product according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the starting overbasic compound, sulfonate and/or phenate and/or salicylate, has a

basicity reserve corresponding to a total base number (TBN) up to 600 mg of potash
per gram.
A colloidal product according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that it has a sulfur content up to 30% by weight and a nitrogen content up to 15% by

weight, relative to the weight of the active material.
A colloidal product according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that it has a calcium content up to 30% by weight and/or a content of magnesium up to

15% by weight, relative to the weight of the active material.
A lubricating oil or grease composition characterized in that it comprises a
major proportion of lubricating oil or grease and a proportion of from 0.1 to 25% of at

least one product according to any one of claims 1 to 6, expressed as the weight of
active material.
