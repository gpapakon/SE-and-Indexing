<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre for heavy load which prevents 
irregular abrasion generated at an edge of a land at 

the side of a shoulder inside a land of a shoulder 
edge. An irregular abrasion preventing land (5) is 

formed at an edge of a second land (7) at the side 
of the shoulder inside a shoulder edge (2), whereby 

the irregular abrasion generated at the part is 
prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre
for heavy loads which is adapted to prevent
irregular abrasion from being generated at the
shoulder-side edge of a region or land located
inside the region or land of the shoulder edge.It is necessary to control the shape of a tyre when
the tyre hits the ground in order to improve the
operativity and abrasion resistance of a heavy load
tyre which has a tread radius and amounts of camber
at the central part of the tread and the shoulder
edges.When the above shape is elliptic, in spite of the
favourable operativity and wandering performance,
the shoulder edges easily slip at the road surface
because of the lower contact pressure in the
vicinity thereof when the tyre contacts the ground,
so that the shoulder edges are abraded irregularly.If the sliding abrasion at the shoulder is reduced
and the tread radius is increased, the touch
pressure in the vicinity of the shoulder edge is
increased and the contact length of the shoulder to 
the ground is increased. If the contact or touching
length at the central part of the tread is
maintained at a certain value to keep the
operativity (linear motion stability and steering
response), the touch pressure at a second region or
land counted from the shoulder edge becomes lower
than at the other parts, and therefore the edge of
the second land is abraded non-uniformly. This
irregular abrasion spread gradually all over the
width of the land, leading to punching of the land.Under the circumstances, forming a small step-like
land has been proposed to eliminate the irregular
abrasion described above (e.g. Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication Nos. 2-169305, 2-88312 and 2-88311).
Such a narrow stepped land or rib is also
disclosed in a zig-zag tyre pattern by the generic US-A-5345988.
The stepped portion is disposed between 2 and 4mm
below the main land or rib body in order to improve
the draining performance of the tyre.However, in the conventional technique, the step-like
land is sometimes out of touch with the ground
depending on the using condition (condition of the
load) which induces irregular abrasion at the edge
of the second land seen from the shoulder edge. In 
the case where a notch is cut at a part of the
second land closer to the centre of the tyre, it is
disadvantageously impossible to avoid the irregular
abrasion due to the twisting force brought about by
the notch.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a pneumatic tyre for heavy load which can prevent
irregular abrasion at the second land inside
