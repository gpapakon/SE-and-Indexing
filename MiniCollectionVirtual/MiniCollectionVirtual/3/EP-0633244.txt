<ABSTRACT>
In the process according to the invention, an N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine, for example N-methylglucamine, is reacted with a fatty acid alkyl ester and in the presence of a basic catalyst. The reaction is carried out continuously in at least two, preferably in two or three, stirring vessels arranged in a cascade under specific conditions in each stirring vessel. Using the process according to the invention, polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, for example N-methyl fatty acid glucamides, are obtained continuously in high yield and purity.

A process for the continuous preparation of
polyhydroxy-fatty amide by reaction of N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine

and C
1
 to C
4
 alkyl ester of fatty acid in the
presence of basic catalysts, which comprises continuously

carrying out the reaction in two or three stirred tanks
arranged in a cascade and carrying it out in this case in

such a way that

a
1
) the N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine is first reacted with an
alkali metal alkoxide or an alkali metal hydroxide

or with a mixture thereof in an amount of 0.01 to
0.15 mol per mole of N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine to

prepare an essentially anhydrous mixture essentially
comprising N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine and catalyst and
a
2
) the mixture prepared in step a
1
) in the form of a
flowing melt and the C
1
 to C
4
 alkyl ester of fatty
acid in an amount of 1 to 1.5 mol per mole of N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine

used in step a
1
) are
continuously and simultaneously fed to the first

stirred tank and in the tank a temperature of 60 to
120°C is maintained and a residence time is

maintained so that a single-phase liquid reaction
mixture is obtained,
b) the single-phase liquid reaction mixture leaving the
first stirred tank and entering the second stirred

tank is kept in the second stirred tank at a
temperature of 60 to 100°C, under vacuum and for a

residence time such that, in the case of two stirred
tanks, 80 to 98 mol% of the N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine

are reacted, essentially all of the C
1
 to C
4
 alcohol 
present being distilled off, and, in the case

of three stirred tanks, 80 to 95 mol% of the
N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine are reacted, C
1
 to C
4
 alcohol
present being distilled off down to a residual

amount of 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on solid
product,
c) in the process having two stirred tanks, the
polyhydroxy-fatty amide is isolated from the

reaction mixture leaving the second stirred tank; in
the process having three stirred tanks, the single-phase

liquid reaction mixture leaving the second
stirred tank and entering the third stirred tank is

kept in the third stirred tank at a temperature of
60 to 100°C, under vacuum and for a residence time

such that 93 to 99 mol% of the N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine
are reacted, essentially all of the C
1
 to C
4

alcohol present being distilled off, and that
d) the polyhydroxy-fatty amide is isolated from the
reaction mixture leaving the third stirred tank.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein
methanol is fed to the first stirred tank in an amount of

0.5 to 20 mol per mole of the N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine fed
to the first stirred tank.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 2, wherein a viscosity-decreasing agent selected

from the group comprising ethylene glycol, propylene
glycol or C
8
 to C
18
 fatty alcohols or ethoxylates thereof
having 1 to 5 ethylene oxide units is fed to the second

stirred tank in an amount of 1 to 50% by weight, based on
solid product.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 2, wherein ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or a

mixture thereof as a viscosity-decreasing agent is fed to
the second stirred tank in an amount of 1 to 50% by

weight, based on solid product.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein the N-alkylpolyhydroxyamine used is

N-methylglucamine, the alkyl ester of fatty acid used is
a methyl ester of fatty acid, the alkali metal alkoxide 

used is potassium methylate or sodium methylate and the
alkali metal hydroxide used is potassium hydroxide or

sodium hydroxide.
