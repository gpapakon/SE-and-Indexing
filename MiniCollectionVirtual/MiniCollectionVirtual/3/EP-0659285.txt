<ABSTRACT>
A machine supplied with strip material and including a plurality of feed hoppers (21) arranged on a turret (20). When an external supply such as a large-capacity hopper (30) is used, an interface device (50) defines a guide (51) between the outlet slot of the external supply and the inlet slot of the machine. The interface device (50) is characterised in that at least one portion (22) of the guide is combined with the rotary turret and rotates therewith. This system is useful for supplying a photographic printer.

<CLAIMS>
Machine (11) comprising: 

a) an inlet slot (13) for receiving a material in 
strip form (12) and directing it to a station where it 

is to be used; 
b) a feed device (10) provided with a rotary turret 
(20) able to receive several removable feed magazines 

(21) containing rolls of said material in strip form; 
c) means (16) for driving, towards the inlet slot, a 
strip of said material coming from a given feed magazine 

fixed to said rotary turret; and 
d) means (15) for interrupting the feed of the strip 
for the purpose of changing the feed magazine used; 
 
   machine characterised: 


i) in that it also comprises an interfacing device 
(50) arranged so as to connect the inlet slot to a strip 

feed source (30) external to said turret; 
ii) in that said interfacing device (50) comprises 
means (22, 23) for defining a guide path for the strip 

coming from the external source (30); and 
iii) in that said means (22, 23) for defining said 
guide path has a part (22) fixed to said turret, which 

part is able to rotate with it. 
Machine according to Claim 1, in which the strip (12) 
is a photosensitive strip. 
Machine according to Claim 2, in which said means (22, 
23) of the interfacing device (50) comprises a firs
t 
means (23) for connecting the external source (30) to 

the part which is able to rotate with the turret when 
this part is used, said first means being articulated so 

as to tilt between a first position in which this first 
means provides a lightproof path during the use of the 

external strip feed source (30) and a second position in 
which this first means is situated outside the space  

 
defined by all the feed magazines when the turret 

rotates. 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, in which 
the interfacing device (50) comprises means (41, 42) for 

moving the downstream end of the strip towards the 
external source when said means (15) for interrupting 

the feed of the strip is actuated, so that the part of 
the guide path which rotates with the turret no longer 

contains any strip. 
Machine according to Claim 4, characterised in that it 
comprises a guide device (160) defining a path of 

predetermined width when the strip coming out from a 
feed magazine is started off and a path of normal width 

when a strip coming from the external source is used. 
Method for supplying a product in strip form coming 
from a source (30) external to a machine (11) fitted 

with an entrance slot and feed magazines (21) disposed 
on a rotary turret (20) for the purpose of disposing the 

magazines one after another in a position in which they 
are able to supply the strip which they contain to the 

machine, method characterised in that the discharge from 
the external source (30) is connected to the entrance 

feed slot (13) of the machine by an interfacing device 
(50) comprising means (22, 23) defining a path, at least 

one part of which is fixed to the turret and rotates 
with it.
