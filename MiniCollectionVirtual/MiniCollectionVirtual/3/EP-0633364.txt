<ABSTRACT>
A multipurpose hanging device for profile rails exhibits a U-shaped carrying part (1) which consists of sheet metal and has an approximately square web plate (2), from which two elongate, parallel U-legs (4) are angled off at right angles. On their opposite borders, the free ends (5) of the U-legs (4) exhibit latching incisions (6). A sheet-metal mating piece (8) which can be connected to the free ends (5) of the U-legs (4) exhibits an approximately square base plate (9), from which, on two opposite edges (10), in each case one short retaining leg (11) is angled off at right angles. Jutting out towards one another from the free ends of the retaining legs (11) are angled-off latching strips (14) which engage into the latching incisions (6).

<CLAIMS>
A multi-purpose suspension system for sectional rails 
having the following features: 


a) a U-shaped metal sheet support section (1) including 
an approximately square web (2), with two elongated 

parallel U-legs (4) being provided on the same at a right 
angle; 
b) the free ends (5) of the U-legs (4) including locking 
recesses (6) at opposite ends; 
((b1) a connecting port (27) provided in the web (2) of the 
support section (1), characterised in that the multi-purpose 

suspension system includes the following 
additional features: 
c) a metal sheet counterpart (8) connectable by the free 
ends (5) of the U-legs (4) including an approximately 

square baseplate (9), with one short support leg (11) being 
provided at a right angle on two opposite edges (10) each; 
d) locking strips (14) projecting from the free ends of 
the support legs (11) at an angle, engaging in the locking 

recesses (6); 
e) a locking leg (16) provided at an angle on the two 
other edges (15) of the baseplate (9), each in contact with 

the free ends (5) of the U-legs (4); 
f) a connection (23) also provided in the 
baseplate (9) of the counterpart (8). 
A multi-purpose suspension system according to Claim 
1, characterised in that
  
 

   beads (19) are moulded at a right angle to these 
bending edges in both adjacent sheet areas, 


a) on the bending edges (3) between the webs (2) and the 
U-legs (4), 
b) on the bending edges (10) between the baseplate (9) 
and the support legs (11), 
c) on the bending edges (13) between the support legs 
(11) and the locking strips (14) and/or 
d) on the bending edges (15) between the baseplate (9) 
and the stop legs (16). 
A multi-purpose suspension system according to Claim 
1, characterised in that two beads (20) each are moulded at 

a distance from each other and provided mainly in parallel 
in the U-legs (4) of the support section (1). 
A multi-purpose suspension system according to Claim 
3 characterised in that the two beads (20), moulded into 

the free end (5) of the U-leg (4) are diverging. 
A multi-purpose suspension system according to Claim 
1, characterised in that beads (21) are moulded into the 

baseplate (9) of the counterpart (8) provided approximately 
diagonally. 
A multi-purpose suspension system according to Claim 
1, characterised in that the free ends (5) of the U-legs 

(4) and the stop legs (16) of the counterpart (8) in 
contact with the same are provided with congruent bolt and 

rivet bores (17 and/or 18).
