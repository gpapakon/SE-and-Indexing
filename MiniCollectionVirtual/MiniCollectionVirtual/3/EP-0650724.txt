<DESCRIPTION>
Uterine fibrosis is an old and ever present 
clinical problem which goes under a variety of names, 
including uterine hypertrophy, uterine leiomyomata, 
myometrial hypertrophy, fibrosis uteri, and fibrotic 
metritis. Essentially, uterine fibrosis is a condition 
where there is an inappropriate deposition of fibroid 
tissue on the wall of the uterus. This condition is a cause of dysmenorrhea and 
infertility in women. The exact cause of this condition is 
poorly understood but evidence suggests that it is an 
inappropriate response of fibroid tissue to estrogen. Such 
a condition has been produced in rabbits by daily 
administrations of estrogen for 3 months. In guinea pigs, 
the condition has been produced by daily administration of 
estrogen for four months. Further, in rats, estrogen 
causes similar hypertrophy. The most common treatment of uterine fibrosis 
involves surgical procedures both costly and sometimes a 
source of complications such as the formation of abdominal 
adhesions and infections. In some patients, initial 
surgery is only a temporary treatment and the fibroids 
regrow. In those cases a hysterectomy is performed which 
effectively ends the fibroids but also the reproductive 
life of the patient. Also, gonadotropin releasing hormone 
antagonists may be administered, yet their use is tempered 
by the fact they can lead to osteoporosis. This invention provides methods for inhibiting 
uterine fibrosis, comprising administering to a human or 
other mammal in need of treatment an effective amount of a 
compound of formula I     wherein R is hydrogen; hydroxy; C₁-C₆ alkoxy; a 
group of the formula -O-C(O)-Ra, wherein Ra is hydrogen, 
C₁-C₆ alkyl optionally substituted with amino, halo, 
carbonyl, C₁-C₆ alkoxycarbonyl, C₁-C₇ alkanoyloxy, 
carbamoyl and/or aryl; or Ra is C₁-C₆ alkenyl optionally 
substituted with aryl; or Ra is a C₃-C₇ cycloalkyl; or Ra 
is aryl optionally substituted with hydroxy, C₁-C₆ alkyl, 
C₁-C₆ alkoxy, and/or halo; or Ra is -O-aryl, said aryl 
optionally substituted with hydroxy C₁-C₆ alkyl, C₁-C₆ 
alkoxy, and/or halo,
 
   or R is a group of the formula -O-SO₂-Rb wherein 
Rb may be C₁-C₆ alkyl or aryl optionally substituted with 
C₁-C₆ alkyl;
 
   or R is carbamoyloxy wherein the nitrogen may be 
substituted once or twice with C₁-C₆ alkyl;
 
   or R is a group of the formula -O-C(O)Rc-O-(C₁-C₆ 
alkyl) wherein Rc is a bond or C₁-C₆ alkanediyl;

cycloalkyl, or
