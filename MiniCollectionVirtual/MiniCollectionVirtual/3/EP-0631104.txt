An electro-pyrotechnical initiator (100) comprising a
pyrotechnical charge (104) initiated by a heating resistive element

placed in contact with said charge, and designed in particular for
igniting the pyrotechnical system of an air bag type device, the

initiator being characterized in that said resistive element
comprises a flat strip (110) of narrow width 
l
, preferably lying in
the range 80 micrometers to 300 micrometers, and of length L lying in

the range 0.3 mm to 3 mm, the strip being obtained by photoetching a
thin film of resistive metal alloy that has a thickness lying in the

range 1 µm to 15 µm and that has previously been secured to a printed
circuit support (101), said resistive element being connected to two

current feeds (102, 103) via two large electrically-conductive areas
(121, 122), and in that the pyrotechnical charge (104) is a

thermosensitive substance applied in the form of an explosive varnish
covering the resistive element.
An initiator according to claim 1, characterized in that the
resistive flat strip (110) is constituted by a thin layer of

resistive alloy such as nickel-chromium alloy adhering to the support
(101).
An initiator according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
resistive flat strip (110) includes two ends in contact with two

respective electrically-conducting areas (121, 122) each constituted
by a thin layer of conductive metal such as copper, each conductive

area (121, 122) having a shape and a size that ensures it is
independent relative to the resistive flat strip (110).
An initiator according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the explosive varnish constituting the initiation charge is a

fine adhesive layer having a mass that is less than 15% of the total
mass of the pyrotechnical charge, and constituted by a primary

explosive or by a thermosensitive oxidizer-reducer mixture having 2%
to 15% of a film-generating binder added thereto. 
An initiator according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the printed circuit support (101) is made of a composite

plastics material.
A method of making an electro-pyrotechnical initiator (100)
according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it

comprises the following successive steps;

causing a thin foil of resistive metal alloy to adhere on the
printed circuit support (101);
photoetching the flat strip (110) in said thin film of alloy
masked with a desired pattern;
masking the etched thin film so as to define two regions
adjacent to said flat strip (110);
covering the two regions with a thin layer of electrically
conductive metal such as electrolytic coppery, thereby forming two

extensive electrically-conductive areas (121, 122);
fixing two current feeds (102, 103) to said conductive areas
(121, 122) respectively;
mixing explosive substances with a film-generating binder that
has previously been put into solution in an appropriate solvents;
depositing the resulting mixture in the form of a varnish on
the resistive flat strip (110) of the previously-made printed

circuit; and
evaporating the solvent from the varnish so as to form a hard
layer of explosive adhering to the resistive strip (110).
An initiation system characterized in that it comprises an
electro-pyrotechnical initiator (100) according to any one of claims

1 to 5, together with a cap (10) in which a tank (11) is provided
containing an ignition-reinforcing composition or a detonation-reinforcing

composition, and covering said initiator (100) in secure
manner.
