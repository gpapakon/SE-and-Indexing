<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binding agent which is used for stabilizing soil materials and for reducing the water-permeability of water-permeable soils. This binding agent is gypsum-based and contains titanium hydroxide and iron hydroxide compounds in lesser amounts. The invention also relates to a binding agent composition which contains the said binding agent and, additionally, prior known agents which promote stabilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a binding agent for use for
stabilizing soil materials and for reducing the water-permeability
of water-permeable soils. The invention also relates
to a binding agent composition which contains this binding
agent and also contains other binding agents, known per seThe best building areas, in which the soil is very suitable,
have in many places already been taken into use. For this reason,
construction must increasingly focus on areas with very
soft soil, for example clay or silt soil, i.e. so-called cohesive
soils. Therefore the soil must be made loadbearing. Piledriving
was previously the most common method of making soil
suitable for building. However, piledriving is a cumbersome,
slow and relatively expensive method, especially when what is
in question is the constructing of surface areas, streets and
sidewalks, pipelines, and other such projects in a safe manner
so that detrimental depressions will not appear in the course
of time.Such methods for improving the strength of soil have been described
in, for example, FI patent publication 74772, in which
flat pieces of a resilient, open net structure are embedded
into the soil.British application publication 2073090 A describes a method
for improving the strength of soil, in which method long and
wide pieces made of a resilient plastic material are embedded
in parallel into the soil.Since the 1970s, deep stabilization by a method, developed for
it, in which a certain stabilization composition is injected
via a rotating blade forced into the soil has begun to be used
increasingly for the stabilization of soft soils. In this 
method the composition is mixed into the surrounding soil material,
with which it will react, set, and form a bearing column
usually having a diameter of 30-120 cm.Previously, burnt lime was used as a binding agent. At present,
burnt lime (CaO) and cement are generally used at a suitable
mixing ratio.Finnish application publication No. 812355 discloses a method
for improving the strength of the subgrade, wherein both cement
and plasticizers are admixed into a soil which contains moisture.
In particular, these plasticizers are concrete plasticizers
and/or concrete flow promoters, known per se, and they are
used in an amount of 2.5 - 5 %, calculated from the cement
content.So-called quick-clay soils are especially difficult in terms of
stabilization. They are encountered, for example, in the northern
parts of the Soviet Union, in Scandinavia, in Canada, in
the northern parts of New York State, and in
