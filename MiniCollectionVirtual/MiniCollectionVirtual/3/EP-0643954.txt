<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plaster which is applied to a 
trouble part of the human body in order to relieve muscular ache 
or swelling . A taping therapy, which means that plasters are applied to 
trouble parts on the human body, is well known as one of the 
method of medical treatment for a sprain or a bruise. This 
medical treatment is operated at an oriental osteopathy clinic 
where an oriental medical therapy such as an acupuncture, a 
cauterization with moxa,and a finger-pressure treatment are in 
effect . A curative value by the taping treatment can be proved by 
means of a gate control theory, an axis sylinder reflex theory,a 
somatic autonomic reflex theory,and the others. Concretely they 
say that a fascia protective action by means of the taping 
therapy enhances the curative value. Generally, a strain of muscle is often caused by a lack of 
exercise,an external shock,senility,stress and so on.And then a 
muscular ache is caused by the strain of muscles. In order to 
endure the pain,the strain of the muscles is invited again, and 
the condition of the disease developes into a myalgia by the  
 
muscular rigor and developes further into a cellulitis . An usual plaster used for the taping treatment in order to 
abate the muscular ache or swelling is a simple non-pored sheet 
having an adhesive face. Otherwise,the Oriental medical science says that there are 
a large number of important points on the human body ,which are 
connected with the internal organs or tissues and control their 
functions . These points are called "tsubo" in Japan. The non-pored sheet is applied to the disease parts or the 
"tsubo" related to the illness on the human body. Thereby the 
pain of the muscles can be relieved . Above mentioned usual plaster,however,is not sufficient 
for the remedial value. The problem is as follows;
 
   The former non-pored plaster have a function to protect 
the malady parts or the "tsubo" related to the disease on the 
human body. Thereby,a burden on the trouble parts or the "tsubo" 
can be relieved,and then a healing phenomenon by a natural 
healing force can proceed smoothly in the human body . However,since the non-pored plaster is no more than a 
protective sheet which protect the disease parts on the human 
body until natural recovery from disease , it is difficult to 
expect a positive and early recovery. Accordingly the remedial 
value by the former non-pored plaster is still inadequate. In view of the foregoing,an object of the invention is to  
 
provide a plaster which is
