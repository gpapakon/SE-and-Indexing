<ABSTRACT>
A liquid enteral nutritional product contains a protein system of, by weight, 
about 50-90% of a soy protein hydrolysate having a degree of hydrolysis in the 

range of 14 to 17 and not more than 50% of one or more intact protein sources. 
The nutritional product may also contain an emulsifier, Iota carrageenan and 

Kappa carrageenan.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to liquid nutritional products for
enteral consumption and more specifically to such nutritional products which
contain a partially hydrolyzed vegetable protein and intact vegetable protein.It is believed to be medically advantageous to provide an enteral liquid
nutritional product having a source of protein comprising a soy protein
hydrolysate of the type manufactured using a process taught in U.S. Patent
4,100,024. Briefly, this process for the preparation of polypeptides from soy
protein soluble in an aqueous media at pH's in the range of 2 to 7 involves:
hydrolyzing soy protein with a microbial, alkaline proteinase in a
concentration ranging from 4 to 25 Anson units per kg of soy protein at a
substrate concentration of between 5 and 20% w/w soy protein at a pH in
the range of from 7.5 to 8.5, until a degree of hydrolysis in the range of from
about 8 to 15% is attained, whereafter the enzyme is inactivated by
reduction of pH with a food grade acid, then recovering the supernatant from
the precipitate. However, it is understood that a soy protein hydrolysate
produced by any other process which has the characteristics elaborated
upon herein may be used in the practice of the present invention.An example of a nutritional product containing such a soy protein
hydrolysate is taught in U.S. Patent 4,959,350, but this prior art nutritional
product has a pH of lower than 4.5 (as compared to a pH of 6.4 to 6.6 in the
product of the present invention).A further example of a nutritional product containing a protein source
wherein diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides are used as
emulsion stabilizers is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,497,800; however, this
nutritional product necessarily comprises, in addition to the mentioned
ingredients, an amount of lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and 
organic or mineral acids, and on the whole the nutritional product is
characterized by a pH in the range of 4.0 to 5.7, which is significantly lower
than the pH of the product according present invention.Finally, EP 465 801 discloses an edible product consisting of an
aqueous solution comprising 70 to 95% of a protein isolate capable of
forming a film and 5 to 30% of a mixture of lipids and emulsifier, said
emulsifier containing diacetyltartaric esters of monoglycerides. However, this
prior art aims at providing an product which is useful as moisture barrier
coating to be applied between the components in a heterogeneous food
system in order to reduce the migration
