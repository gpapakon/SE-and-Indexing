<ABSTRACT>
A carburetor comprises a jet needle (7) which has a taper portion 
gradually decreasing in diameter toward its head and which is 

inserted in a main nozzle (3) which is provided crossing with an 
intake pass and provided with a main jet (13) at its lower end. A 

gap between said main nozzle (3) and said jet needle (7) is 
allowed to change so as to control the flow of a fuel taken in 

from the head of the jet needle (7). The lower end of the main jet 
(13) fixedly provided on the head of said main nozzle (3) comprises 

a conical surface (16) and a planar portion (17). The main 
jet (13) has a plurality of downward oblique holes (18) boredly 

provided on said conical surface (16) in such a manner that the 
holes are equally spaced on the circumference at an inclined angle 

30 to 90 ° to axial direction. The internal surface of said 
oblique holes (18) is made a rough surface (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the improvement of a 
carburetor in engines using gasoline, light oil or the like 
as a fuel for, for example, automobiles, motorcycles and the 
like. Heretofore, a known structure of such carburetor is, 
for example, as shown in Fig. 1, such that it is provided 
with a throttle valve 6 which is moved in the direction 
crossing with an intake passage 2 communcating with an engine 
so as to form a variable venturi portion 5 in the intake 
passage 2; provided with a main nozzle 3 for controlling fuel 
inflow in a manner to cross with the intake passage 2 as with 
the throttle valve 6; and provided with a jet needle 7 which has a 
taper portion gradually decreasing in diameter toward its 
head, and whose base end is mounted to said throttle valve 6, 
and whose tapering head portion is inserted into the main 
mozzle 3. With the axial movement of the throttle valve 6, the 
gap between the main nozzle 3 and the jet needle 7 is 
allowed to change, whereby fuel proportional to the 
intake flow flowing through the venturi portion is taken in  
 
from the main nozzle 3 so as to control air-fuel ratio. Known head configurations of the jet needle 7 include 
the needle configuration in which its body tapers toward its 
head at a certain taper angle, and the conical configuration 
in which its body becomes conical at its head. 
A main jet 13 is threadingly connected to the lower end of 
the main nozzle 3. Such a carburetor is disclosed in the JP-A-4-66 760 
which serves as the basis for the preamble of claim 1. An object of the invention is to provide a carburetor 
capable of reducing the area of the boundary layer in the 
pass of fluid such as fuel or air, or mixed gas, of 
improving fuel efficiency by optimizing air-fuel ratio and 
eliminating knock and short breath, and of making design and 
setting easy so as to improve usability. This object is achieved by the carburetor of claim 1. 
Namely, in the carburetor in which the jet needle 7 which has a 
taper portion gradually decreasing in diameter toward its 
head is inserted in the main nozzle 3 which is provided 
crossing with an intake passage and provided with the main jet 
13 at its lower end, and with the axial movement of the 
throttle valve 6, the gap between the main nozzle 3 and the 
jet needle 7 is allowed to change so as to control the flow 
of a fuel taken in from the head of the jet needle 7; the 
lower end of the main jet 13 fixedly provided on the head of 
said main nozzle 3 comprises a conical surface 16 and a 
planar

<CLAIMS>
A carburetor in which a jet needle (7) which has a taper 
portion gradually decreasing in a diameter toward its head is 

inserted in a main nozzle (3) which is provided crossing with an 
air intake passage (2) and provided with a main jet (13) at its 

lower end, the jet needle (7) being mounted on the lower end of 
a throttle valve (6), which is disposed in the air intake passage 

(2) for axial movement therewith, whereby the gap between 
said main nozzle (3) and said jet needle (7) is allowed to 

change so as to control the flow of a fuel taken in from the 
head of the jet needle (7);
 
the carburetor being characterized in that the lower end of the 

main jet (13) fixedly provided on the head of said main nozzle 
(3) comprises a conical surface (16) and a planar portion (17), 

the main jet (13) has a plurality of downward oblique holes (18) 
boredly provided on said conical surface (16) in such a manner 

that the holes are equally spaced on the circumference at an 
inclined angle 30 to 90° to axial direction, and the internal 

surface of said oblique holes (18) is made a rough surface (19). 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 1, wherein the internal 
wall surface of fuel intake holes following said plurality of 

downward oblique holes (18) of the main nozzle (3) is also provided 
with the rough surface (19). 
The carburetor as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein an 
upward oblique hole (21) other than the downward oblique holes 

(18) is further provided.
