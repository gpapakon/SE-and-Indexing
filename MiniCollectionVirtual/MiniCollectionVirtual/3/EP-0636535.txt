<ABSTRACT>
A direct transmission system for a bicycle includes a 
first bevel gear (19) mounted on a front axle (11) of the bicycle to 

rotate therewith. A first box (12) is fixed to a bottom bracket (1) 
of the bicycle. A shell member has a second box (3) and a 

bracket (49) which are coupled together for housing the rear axle (51) 
of the bicycle. The bracket abuts against a hub member (5) of 

the bicycle. A chain stay (13) of the bicycle is securely 
engaged between the first box and the second box. A shaft (2) 

having a first end (20) and a second end (21), is mounted in the chain 
stay. The first and second ends respectively extend into 

the first and second boxes. A second bevel gear (18) is mounted 
on the first end of the shaft to rotate therewith and meshes 

with the first bevel gear. A third bevel gear (32) is mounted on 
the second end of the shaft to rotate therewith and is 

received in the second box. A fourth bevel gear (41) is mounted 
in the shell member for meshing with the third bevel gear 

and is securely attached to the hub member to rotate therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct transmission 
system, and more particularly to a direct transmission 
system for a bicycle. The closest prior art of a direct transmission system 
for a bicycle is disclosed in the Applicant's own U.S. 
Patent No. 5,078,025, filed October 29, 1990. There are 
still a few drawbacks in this patent. First, the first 
bevel gear portion and the rear end of the shaft are not 
securely engaged, so that the first bevel gear portion is 
apt to be loosened from the shaft during long-term utilization, 
and thus causes the meshing engagement between the 
first and second bevel gear portions to be insufficiently 
tight. Moreover, the bottom bracket is in a closed state, 
so, it is not to easy to inspect the interior thereof so 
that the parts in the bottom bracket are not easy to be 
dismantled and assembled, and thus causing difficulty in 
maintenance. Further, the chain stay is not securely attached 
to the box of the direct transmission system so that 
the structure of the bicycle is not stable. The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or 
obviate the afore-mentioned disadvantages of the 
conventional direct transmission system for a bicycle. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a direct transmission system for a bicycle. 
The bicycle has a front axle which has a first end and a 
second end, a bottom bracket engaged around the front axle, 
a rear axle, a hub member rotatably engaged around the rear  
 
axle, a chain stay, and a seat stay. The direct 
transmission system includes a first bevel gear mounted on 
the first end of the front axle to rotate therewith. A 
first box is fixed to the bottom bracket. A shell member 
has a second box and a bracket which are coupled together 
for housing the rear axle. The bracket abuts against the 
hub member and the chain stay is securely engaged between 
the first box and the second box. A shaft having a first 
end and a second end, is mounted in the chain stay. The 
first and second ends respectively extend into the first and 
second boxes. A second bevel gear is mounted on the first 
end of the shaft to rotate therewith and meshes with the 
first bevel gear. A third bevel gear is mounted on the 
second end of the shaft to rotate therewith and is received 
in the second box. A fourth bevel gear is mounted in the 
shell member for meshing with the third bevel gear and is 
securely attached to the hub member to rotate therewith. By such an arrangement, the second and third bevel.

<CLAIMS>
A direct transmission system for a bicycle, said 
bicycle has a front axle which has a first end and a second 

end, a bottom bracket engaged around said front axle, a rear 
axle, a hub member rotatably engaged around said rear axle, 

a chain stay, and a seat stay, said direct transmission 
system comprising: 

   a first bevel gear mounted on said first end of said 
front axle to rotate therewith; 

   a first box fixed to said bottom bracket; 
   a shell member having a second box and a bracket which 

are coupled together for housing said rear axle, said chain 
stay being securely engaged between said first box and said 

second box, said bracket abutting against said hub member; 
   a shaft mounted in said chain stay and having a f
irst 
end and a second end, said first and second ends 

respectively extending into said first and second boxes; 
   a second bevel gear mounted on said first end of said 

shaft to rotate therewith and meshing with said first bevel 
gear; 

   a third bevel gear mounted on said second end of said 
shaft to rotate therewith and received in said second box; 

and 
   a fourth bevel gear mounted in said shell member for 

meshing with said third bevel gear and securely attached to 
said hub member to rotate therewith. 
The direct transmission system for a bicycle in 
accordance with claim 1, further comprising a pair of first 

 
ball bearings mounted between said second bevel gear and said 

first box, a retaining ring being securely engaged on a 
distal end of said second bevel gear and abutting against 

said pair of first ball bearings to prevent said pair of 
first ball bearings from disengaging with said second bevel 

gear. 
The direct transmission system for a bicycle in 
accordance with claim 1, further comprising a second ball 

bearing mounted between said third bevel gear and said 
second box, a retaining ring being securely engaged on a 

distal end of said third bevel gear and abutting against 
said second ball bearing to prevent said second ball bearing 

from disengaging with said third bevel gear. 
The direct transmission system for a bicycle in 
accordance with claim 1, wherein said second bevel gear has 

a first key slot formed therein and said third bevel gear 
has a second key slot formed therein, said first and second 

ends of said shaft each having a plurality of key slots 
longitudinally formed thereon and respectively engaged with 

said first and second key slots by appropriate keys in said 
second and third bevel gears. 
The direct transmission system for a bicycle in 
accordance with claim 1, wherein said bracket has a hole 

formed therein through which said rear axle passes and is 
thus threadedly engaged with a nut.
