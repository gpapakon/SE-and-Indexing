<ABSTRACT>
A waste paper treatment process for the recycle and re-use of waste paper, which process comprises treating the waste paper , in a repulper, with a surfactant, preferably in the absence of traditional repulper chemicals such as silicate, caustic and peroxide. The surfactant is preferably a copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and is used in a sufficient concentration to form ink agglomerates which are retained on the paper as essentially non-visible agglomerates, rather than being removed from the recycled pulp as in traditional waste paper deinking. The process permits the elimination of normal repulper chemicals, and reduces the amount of ink sludge generated, while providing acceptable brightness levels for the recycled pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the treatment
of waste paper pulps, in particular to a process for
the treatment of waste paper pulps in a repulping stage and
to a recycled paper.Because of increasing public demand, the use of
recycled paper has steadily increased. To recover the
fibres used for papermaking from wastepaper, a waste
paper deinking operation must generally be carried out to
remove the inks used in printing, and thus create a
wastepaper with suitable appearance for re-use.
Traditionally, deinking has been conducted by either
washing, or flotation deinking.Wastepaper may contain a mixture of newspapers,
magazines, telephone directories, printed advertising
material, corrugated containers and the like. The paper
fibres used to produce these materials may be chemically
pulped materials, such as Kraft pulps, or may be
mechanical produced pulps such as groundwood. Much of
this wastepaper has undergone some form of printing
operation, which printing operation leaves a deposit of
ink on the paper. To date, wastepaper recycling has
concentrated on removal of the ink, prior to re-use of
the recycled waste paper for further printing.The basic stages in a typical washing or flotation
deinking process are: repulping the wastepaper in a
repulper; coarse cleaning and screening of the repulped
material; deinking; fine cleaning and screening;
post-bleaching, and finally, storage. A key component in a typical old newspaper (ONP)
deinking operation is treatment of the waste paper in the
repulper. In the repulper, the wastepaper is typically
treated in water with chemicals such as caustic soda,
sodium silicate and hydrogen peroxide, as described
hereinbelow. A metal chelating agent may also be
included.The repulping stage may degrade the resin surrounding
the ink particles, while the physical action of the
repulper helps to separate the ink from the fibres.Repulping is followed by a series of coarse cleaners
and screens to remove large particles, like staples and
plastics from the pulp. The cleaned pulp is passed to
either a wash or a flotation deinking stage.In wash deinking, a large volume of water is passed
through the repulped wastepaper which wastepaper is
supported on a mesh screen. Theink and other particles
are washed through, and away from the pulp.In flotation deinking, chemicals designed to collect
the ink particles together are employed while air bubbles
are introduced to the repulped wastepaper. The
hydrophobic nature of the ink particles treated with
collector chemicals promotes the

A waste paper treatment process comprising:

(i) mixing a waste paper, having a plurality of
attached ink particles, with water to form an aqueous

waste paper slurry;
