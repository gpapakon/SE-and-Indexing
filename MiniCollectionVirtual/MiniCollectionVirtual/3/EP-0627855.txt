<ABSTRACT>
When an advanced television (ATV) signal is recorded 
by a digital VCR (3) in the conventional television signal 

recording mode, variable speed reproduction data composed 
of high priority (HP) data containing an in-frame encoded 

frame (I frame) is redundantly recorded in a surplus record 
area that is formed by the difference between the 

transmission rate of the ATV signal and the transmission 
rate of the conventional compressed digital video signal. 

When variable speed reproduction is performed, the variable 
speed reproduction data can be successfully reproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital video signal recording apparatus and
method. An embodiment of such an apparatus and method is suitable for directly
recording an ATV (Advanced Television) signal to a magnetic tape through a rotating
head.EP-A-0 553 949 was published after the priority date of the present application
and is part of the state of the art according to Article 54(3) EPC. It discloses an apparatus
for decoding digital data representative of a compressed digital image signal. The
apparatus provides digital data representative of a compressed high definition video
image signal in a manner such that a conventional video tape recorder (VTR) employing
current electrical and mechanical technologies is adaptable for reading this data for
display in special modes such as fast forward, reverse and still frame. To minimise the
loss of data while the VTR is operating in one of these special modes, the data
representative of the high definition image signal is decoded by the apparatus to yield
available time slots in the data stream. These time slots are then filled with data which
duplicates the most important of the original transmitted data then existing in other time
slots in the data stream. This duplicating of the data increases the likelihood that the
important picture information will be read by the VTR while operating in a special mode.
To facilitate fast recovery from lost of synchronisation, the apparatus utilises a small
fraction of the original image which is included in each section or slice of the transmitted
image. As synchronisation is reacquired, the high definition video image is built from
the image found in the slices.WO 94/17631 designates the EPO and was published after the priority date of the
present application. It discloses a digital video tape record/playback apparatus for
processing a high definition television signal includes provision for controlling the
occurrence of high priority image information. Such information is selectively recorded
at normal speed in tape tracks within predetermined regions so as to appear along a tape
head scanning path associated with predetermined tape playback speeds greater than
normal (e.g. 20x normal). Input high priority data cells may be reordered or duplicated
for recording in the predetermined tape regions in other than received order. In either 
case, the input datastream is massaged to produce a viewable image in a fast playback
mode. In an illustrated system for receiving an MPEG coded datastream, an output
datastream at

A digital video signal recording apparatus for directly recording a data-compressed
image signal on a magnetic tape at a predetermined data rate, comprising:


means (1) for providing high priority data and standard priority data of the

image signal, the data rate of the high priority data being lower than the said
predetermined data rate;
means (3, 4, 5) for processing the high priority data at the said predetermined
data rate thereby time-compressing the high priority data, and
means (3, 4, 5) for redundantly recording the compressed high priority data on
the tape at the said predetermined data rate.
The apparatus as set forth in claim 1, wherein the providing means (1)
comprises means for dividing the image signal into the high priority data and the

standard priority data.
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the image signal
comprises an in-frame encoded frame as the said high priority data and a forward or bi-directional

predicted encoded frame as the said standard priority data.
The apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the recording
means (3) allocates the high priority data to positions on the tape during recording at a

first speed that allow valid reproduction thereof during reproduction at speeds other
