<ABSTRACT>
A deceleration sensor switch comprises a base (12d) 
including a plate portion (15d) and a rod portion (18d) 

having a longitudinal central axis (99d). In one 
embodiment (Figs. 11-15), a rectangular mass (20d) is 

mounted on the rod portion. The mass is spaced apart from 
the plate portion at a distance which prevents rotation of 

the mass about the axis of the rod portion. When the mass 
moves from an unactuated position to an actuated position, 

the mass moves away from a releasable tab portion (42d) of 
a contact (40d) to allow a contact portion (52d) of the 

contact to move into engagement with an electrical terminal 
(34d). The contact portion is spaced apart a predetermined 

distance (D) from the terminal when the mass is in the 
unactuated position. The tab portion includes a pair of 

contact ears (334) having convex-shaped arcuate edge 
surfaces (338) which allow the contact portion to maintain 

the same predetermined distance from the terminal upon 
movement of the mass in a direction perpendicular to the 

axis of the rod portion. The mass has a protection tab 
(306) which prevents a cover (11d) from striking the 

contact when the cover is moved into engagement with the 
base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a deceleration sensor
switch, and is particularly directed to a deceleration
sensor switch comprising an inertia mass which moves
against a spring bias in response to a predetermined
deceleration.Deceleration sensor switches which include an inertia
mass which moves against a spring bias in response to a
predetermined deceleration are known. One known
deceleration sensor switch includes a donut-shaped inertial
mass slidable on a rod against a spring bias. Another
known deceleration sensor switch includes a mass disposed
in a cylindrical chamber in a body and movable in the
chamber against a spring bias. Also, some of the known
deceleration sensor switches have means for adjusting the 
spring bias to adjust the responsiveness of the
deceleration sensor switch.In accordance with one embodiment of the present
invention, a deceleration sensor switch comprises a mass mounted on a rod portion and
movable relative to the rod portion between an unactuated
position and an actuated position along the longitudinal
central axis of the rod portion. The mass
moves from the unactuated position to the actuated position
when the deceleration sensor switch is subjected to
deceleration of a predetermined magnitude. The
mass moves against a spring bias to provide a restoring
force which acts on the mass to move the
mass relative to the rod portion from the
actuated position back to the unactuated position. The
spring bias is provided by a helical coil spring helically
wound around the rod portion along its longitudinal central
axis.First and second electrical terminals are electrically
connectable with each other. Connecting means is provided
for electrically connecting the first and second electrical
terminals with each other when the mass moves from the
unactuated position to the actuated position. The
connecting means comprises a contact including (i) a
releasable tab portion which engages the mass 
when said mass is in the unactuated position and
which is released for movement with the rectangular mass
when the rectangular mass moves from the unactuated
position to the actuated position, (ii) a biasing portion
which biases the tab portion into engagement with the
rectangular mass, and (iii) a contact portion which is
spaced apart a predetermined distance from one of the first
and second electrical terminals when the rectangular mass
is in the unactuated position and which contacts the one
electrical terminal when the rectangular mass is in the
actuated position.According to a further
