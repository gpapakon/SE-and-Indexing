Process for separating a gaseous hydride or a mixture of 
gaseous hydrides, not comprising silane, from a gaseous medium 

containing at least one gas from the group consisting of H
2
, 
Ar, He, characterized in that the gaseous medium is passed 

through a membranous module (6), so as to obtain at the non-permeate 
outlet of the module a concentration of the said 

hydride or said mixture of hydrides greater than its 
concentration in the gaseous medium, and in that the hydride 

or mixture of hydrides is comprised within the group 
consisting of disilane, phosphine, arsine and germane. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
gaseous medium arrives under pressure at the membranous 

module, the pressure difference between the inlet and the 
permeate side of the membrane not exceeding 100 × 10
5
 Pa 
absolute. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
pressure difference between the inlet and the permeate side of 

the membrane is situated within the interval 10
5
 Pa and 20 × 
10
5
 Pa absolute. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
gaseous medium arrives at the membranous module at a low 

pressure. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
said low pressure is compensated for by lowering, on the 

permeate side of the membrane, the partial pressure of the 
gaseous medium which is separated from the said gaseous 

hydride or from the said mixture of gaseous hydrides. 
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
partial pressure of the gaseous medium which is separated from 

the said gaseous hydride or from the said mixture of gaseous  
 

hydrides is lowered, on the permeate side (8) of the membrane 
(6) by using one of the following methods : 


the permeate side (8) of the membrane (6) is put under 
vacuum; 
the permeate side (8) of the membrane (6) is swept with 
the aid of a gas having a low permeation of permeate towards 

the inside of the membrane. 
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
gas used for sweeping is nitrogen. 
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
gas used for sweeping is SF
6
. 
Process according to one of claims 4 to 8, characterized 
in that the pressure of the gaseous medium to be separated 

which arrives at the membranous module is situated in the 
interval 10
4
 Pa to 5 × 10
5
 Pa absolute. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the gaseous medium treated in the membranous module 

comes from a generator for producing gaseous hydrides. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
generator of gaseous hydrides generates arsine by an 

electrolytic route, producing at the cathode the said gaseous 
medium, consisting of a mixture of arsine and hydrogen. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that : 


a) the gaseous medium treated in the membranous module 
consists of the reaction mixture obtained at the outlet from a 

reactor operating with a hydride or gaseous hydrides, this 
reaction medium containing a proportion of unreacted gaseous 

hydride or hydrides; 
b) the mixture obtained at the outlet from the membranous 
module (6) is then recycled to the inlet of the reactor. 
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
reactor is a deposition reactor, operating with a gaseous 

precursor of silicon. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that : 


a) the gaseous medium treated in the membranous module comes 
from a gas storage vessel of the cylinder type (1), comprising 

a low concentration of a gaseous hydride or mixture of gaseous 
hydrides in a carrier gas selected from the group consisting 

of H
2
, Ar, He, this concentration being compatible with the 
safety limits for the concentrations of these hydrides in the 

said carrier gas; 
b) the mixture obtained at the outlet from the membranous 
module (6) is then directed to a point of use where the 

required concentration of the said gaseous hydride or mixture 
of gaseous hydrides is higher than that of the storage vessel 

of stage a). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterized 
in that the membranous module employs several membranes with 

different characteristics. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 15, characterized 
in that the membranous module employs at least one membrane of 

the polyimide or polyaramide type.
