<ABSTRACT>
A liquid container 1 comprises a larger glass bottle 2 and 
a smaller glass bottle 3 which are separately formed and 

adhesively bonded together. A base 11 of the smaller 
bottle 3 is spaced slightly above the base 10 of the 

larger bottle 2 so that in use, the base 10 of the larger 
bottle 2 forms a standing surface for the container 1 to 

prevent rocking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a container of the type having 
two separate compartments of different capacities. US-A-2,826,338 and CH-A-19289 describe a container of this type. More particularly, the invention relates to beverage 
containers. In conventional beverage systems a liquid beverage is 
provided as a single liquid in a bottle. There have been 
attempts to provide immiscible or non-homogeneous liquids 
in a bottle, however, such systems require a consumer to 
mix the contents of the bottle prior to pouring to ensure 
that a homogeneous product is obtained. This invention is directed towards providing a novel 
beverage container system which may be used particularly 
for delivering a combination beverage product. The invention is characterised in that a container having 
two separate compartments of different capacities, 
characterised in that the container is a liquid beverages 
container, and in that the separate compartments comprise: 
a first glass bottle for one beverage; a second glass bottle for another beverage; the bottles comprising a smaller capacity bottle 
and a larger capacity bottle having a capacity of 
approximately twice the capacity of the smaller 
bottle; each bottle comprising: 
a base portion; a body portion;  
 a neck portion for receiving a closure; the body portions and neck portions of the 
bottles having flat mating 
surfaces; and an adhesive bonding the mating surfaces 
together to form a joint between the bottles. Preferably the base portion of the smaller capacity bottle 
is spaced upwardly from the base portion of the larger 
capacity bottle to spread the load and prevent rocking of 
the container, in use. Most preferably, the cross-sectional 
area of the base portion of the larger capacity 
bottle is larger than the cross-sectional area of the base 
portion of the smaller capacity bottle and the load of the 
container is supported by the larger base portion. In one embodiment of the invention the neck portion of the 
bottles are adapted to receive cork stoppers. In another embodiment of the invention the neck portions 
of the bottles are adapted to be sealed by screw type 
closures. In a preferred arrangement each bottle includes a recess 
portion in the outer surface thereof to receive a label. The invention will be more clearly understood from the 
following description thereof given by way of example only 
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 is a front elevational view of a container 
according to the invention; Fig. 2 is a side

<CLAIMS>
A container (1) having two separate compartments 
(2,3) of different capacities, characterised in 

that the container is a liquid beverages container, 
and in that the separate compartments (2,3) 

comprise: 

a first glass bottle (4) for one beverage; 
a second glass bottle (5) for another beverage; 
the bottles (4,5) comprising a smaller capacity 
bottle (5) and a larger capacity bottle (4) having 

a capacity of approximately twice the capacity of 
the smaller bottle (5); 
each bottle comprising: 

a base portion (10,11); 
a body portion (12,13); 
a neck portion (14,15) for receiving a 
closure; 
the body portions (12,13) and neck portions 
(14,15) of the bottles (4,5) having 

flat mating surfaces (16,17); 
and 
an adhesive bonding the mating surfaces 
(16,17) together to form a joint between the 

bottles (4,5). 
A container as claimed in claim 1 wherein the base 
portion (11) of the smaller capacity bottle (5) is 

spaced upwardly from the base portion (10) of the 
larger capacity bottle (4) to spread the load and 

prevent rocking of the container (1), in use.  
 
A container as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
cross-sectional area of the base portion (10) of 

the larger capacity bottle (4) is larger than the 
cross-sectional area of the base portion (11) of 

the smaller capacity bottle (5) and the load of the 
container (1) is supported by the larger base 

portion (10). 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the neck portion (14,15) of the bottles 

(4,5) are adapted to receive cork stoppers. 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the neck portions (14,15) of the bottles 

(4,5) are adapted to be sealed by screw type 
closures. 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 
wherein the body portion (12,13) of each bottle 

(4,5) includes a recess portion (22,23) in the 
outer surface thereof to receive a label. 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the capacities of the respective bottles 

(4,5) in combination with the transparence of the bottles form 
an indicator for comparing the 

levels of the beverages remaining in each bottle 
(4,5) to each other for evidencing that required amounts 

of the 
beverages have been dispensed from the bottles 

(4,5).
