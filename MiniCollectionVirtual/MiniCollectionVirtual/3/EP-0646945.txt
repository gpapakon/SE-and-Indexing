<ABSTRACT>
In each of plural flat-sheet-shaped electrodes (7a,...,7g) 
for constituting an electrode unit used in a flat type 

image display apparatus, an identification hole (7aa,...) is formed 
at respective predetermined pos
itions of each corner part 
to thereby make an alignment of the identification holes 

with a predetermined interval kept between adjacent two 
identification holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat type
image display apparatus which is mainly used for a TV set
or a visual display terminal for computers and its
fabrication method.In a known flat type image display apparatus, an
electron beam emitted from an electron beam source is
controlled (i.e., focussed, modulated and deflected) by a
flat sheet-shaped electrode unit. This flat sheet-shaped
electrode unit consists of plural electron beam control
electrodes which are formed into a lamination body. After
steps of focussing, modulating and deflection, the
electron beam reaches a phosphor screen. The phosphor
screen thereby emits light and forms an image thereon.FIG.15 is an exploded perspective view showing
general construction of the conventional flat type image
display apparatus 101. The image display apparatus 101
has a vacuum case constituted by a front panel 103, a rear
panel 104 and a side wall part (not shown). A phosphor
screen 102 is formed on an inner face of the front panel
103. An inbetween space defined by the front panel 103, 
the side wall part and the rear panel 104 is kept vacuum.
A back electrode 105, plural linear cathodes 106 and a
flat-shaped electrode unit 107 are provided from the back
panel 104 toward the front panel 103. The linear cathodes
106 act as an electron beam source. The back electrode
105 is formed on an inner face of the back panel 104. The
electrode unit 107 consists of an electron beam extracting
electrode 107a, a modulation electrode 107b, a vertical
focussing electrode 107c, a horizontal focussing electrode
107d, a horizontal deflection electrode 107e, a shield
electrode 107f and a vertical deflection electrode 107g.Electron beams emitted from the linear cathode
106 pass through the electron beam extracting electrode
107a, the modulation electrode 107b, the vertical
focussing electrode 107c, the horizontal focussing
electrode 107d, the horizontal deflection electrode 107e,
the shield electrode 107f and the vertical deflection
electrode 107g, thereby getting focussed, modulated and
deflected. Finally, a stream of the electron beams
reaches a predetermined position on the phosphor screen
102, and thereby the screen emits light to make an image.In the electrode unit 107, the respective
electrodes 107a --- 107g are bonded with each other with
each predetermined gap held therebetween, and they are
electrically insulated from each other. As an example, a
method for bonding the shield electrode 107f and the 
vertical deflection electrode 107g will be described with
reference
