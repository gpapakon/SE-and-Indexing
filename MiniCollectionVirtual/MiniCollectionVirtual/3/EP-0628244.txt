<ABSTRACT>
In a method of milking animals, the milk obtained 
can be collected in different storage containers (7, 7') 

after having been separated according to quality and/or 
composition, so that it can be collected in dependence on the 

albumen or fat content. A distinction can also be made 
between milk from one individual animal, in dependence on the 

course of the lactation period. In addition, the milk can be 
collected after separation in dependence on the somatic cell 

count of the milk, whilst a distinction can likewise be made 
between milk obtained during the initial stage of the milking 

operation and that during the further course thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
milking animals, in which the milk obtained from different
animals after having been separated according to quality
and/or composition is collected in different storage
containers. The milk obtained with the aid of teat cups
connected to the teats of an animal to be milked is usually
transferred to a milk tank via a milk meter. In document
EP-A-0 399 604 it is checked whether the milk is obtained
from an animal of which one or more udder quarters suffer
from an illness; this may be established by means of a milk
conductivity sensor to be included in the milk meter or in
the supply lines from the individual teat cups to said milk
meter. The infected milk is not to be transferred to the milk
tank, but to a waste milk tank via a valve incorporated in
the line between the milk meter and the milk tank. The
suitable milk is collected in the milk tank, which is usually
emptied a few times a week. A dairy factory, collecting the
milk from the milk tanks of the farmers, checks this milk
and, if necessary, might put it to different uses, e.g. for
consumption, or for animal food, etc.It is an object of the invention to enable a
determination of the intended use of the milk at an early
stage. According to the invention, in the method of milking
animals, the quality and/or composition is based on the
albumen content, or on the course of the lactation period. In
other words, already immediately after milking, a distinction
in the milk obtained is made and the milk is collected
separately. In this situation, the milk obtained from
different animals can be collected in different storage
containers, whilst it is likewise possible to collect the
milk obtained from one individual animal in different storage
containers, i.e. the milk can be separated during the initial
stage of the milking operation and that during the further
course thereof. The quality and the composition of the milk 
of different animals can be updated in a computer and be
coupled to an animal identification system which is customary
to the automatic milking of animals. The milk obtained from
animals, of which it is known that it has a higher albumen
content or a higher fat content, can be collected directly in
separate storage containers. Since the computer used in the
automatic milking procedure also updates the data which are
relevant to the milking of the animals, in particular the
lactation period of the animals, it is also possible to
collect the milk obtained from an animal during a lactation
period in

<CLAIMS>
A method of milking animals, in which the milk
obtained from different animals is collected in different

storage containers after having been separated according to
quality and/or composition, characterized in that the quality

and/or composition is based on the albumen content, or on the
course of the lactation period.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the milk obtained, depending on the fat content, is

collected in different storage containers, or whether the
milk is obtained during the initial stage of the milking

operation or during the further course thereof or in
dependence on the somatic cell count of the milk.
A construction for applying the method as claimed
in any one of the preceding claims, comprising a milking

machine (1) with teat cups (2) which are connectable to the
teats of an animal to be milked and a milk meter (4), via

which the milk is transferred from the teat cups (2) to means
(6) for collecting same, whereby these means comprise a

plurality of storage containers (7, 7') for the separate
collection of milk of a different quality and/or composition,

characterized in that the construction is provided with a
measuring unit (11) with a measuring element (11) for

establishing during the milking procedure the albumen content
or the fat content or the somatic cell count or the colour,

or the light absorption of the milk or several of these
elements.
A construction as claimed in claim 3, characterized
in that the means (6) are constituted by a milk tank which is

subdivided into compartments (7, 7').
A construction as claimed in claim 4, characterized
in that the milk tank (6) includes two compartments (7, 7').
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to
5, characterized in that, arranged between the milk meter (4)

and the milk collecting means (7, 7'), there is a divider
element (10) for guiding the milk from the milk meter (4) to 

one of the storage containers (7, 7') of the milk collecting
means (6).
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to
5, characterized in that several milk meters (4) are present,

each of which is connected to one of the storage containers
(7, 7') of the milk collecting means (6), whilst furthermore

between the teat cups (2) and the milk meters (4) there is
arranged a divider element (12) for guiding the milk from the

teat cups (2) to one of the milk meters (4).
A construction as claimed in claim 6 or 7,
characterized in that the milking machine (1) operates

automatically and co-operates with an animal identification
system, whilst in the computer of the automatic milking

machine (1) and/or of the animal identification system are
updated the data relevant to the quality and/or composition

of the milk obtained from each animal individually, on the
basis of which data the computer supplies the control signals

for the divider element.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to
8, characterized in that the milking machine (1) includes a

robot for automatically connecting the teat cups (2) to the
teats of an animal to be milked.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to
9, characterized in that the sensor measuring element for

establishing the light absorption in the milk obtained, can
check cloudiness of the milk.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that one or more measuring

elements and/or one or more sensor measuring units are
arranged in the milk meter (4).
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 3 to
10, characterized in that one or more measuring elements

and/or one or more sensor measuring units are arranged in a
line (3) constituting the connection between a teat cup (2)

and the milk meter (4).
