<ABSTRACT>
The present application is concerned with a solid slow release pharmaceutical dosage unit. More specifically, the invention is directed to a tablet form prepared by direct compression of cross-linked amylose (CLA) having a definite cross-linking degree, (alpha)-amylase and a pharmaceutical agent. The presence of the cross-linked amylose allows a sustained release of the drug, while the (alpha)-amylase permits the modulation of the release time. In other words, the release time of the drug is function of the amount of (alpha)-amylase in the tablet. The amount of (alpha)-amylase is defined in terms of Enzyme Units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a solid slow release 
pharmaceutical dosage unit, incorporating cross-linked amylose (CLA) and 
associated α-amylase as slow release matrix. The drug release is controlled 
enzymatically by two different sequential molecular mechanisms. The interest for monolithic devices for the controlled release of drugs 
is continuously growing, and much effort has been done for the development of 
novel pharmaceutical dosage forms ensuring more constant release rate of liberation 
over extended periods of time. Various polymers, such as vinylic polymers, polyethylene, silicone, 
ethylcellulose, acyl-substituted cellulose, poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-PHEMA, 
acrylic copolymers and the like, have been proposed for use as matrices for drug 
controlled release, (see for example US 3,087,860, US 2,987,445, US 4,761,289 and 
Pharm. Acta Helv., 1980, 55, 174-182, Salomon et al.). Despite the multitudes of 
these polymeric matrices that have been developed (hydrogels, hydrophillic, 
hydrophobic and the like), no ideal matrix conferring a sustained drug release at a 
constant rate is known. In this context, many physical and chemical systems have 
been suggested, most of them based on diffusion-controlled, swelling-controlled or 
chemically-controlled (external bioerosion) drug release. The diffusion controlled systems, which require hydrophillic polymers 
such as hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium-carboxymethylcellulose and the like, allow a  
 
sustained release of drugs, but do not permit a rigorous control since the release 
rate is not constant. The swelling-controlled systems are based on glassy homogeneous 
polymeric matrices free of internal channels, into which the water front penetrates 
at a constant rate. Behind this front, the polymer is in a rubbery state. If the 
diffusion coefficient of the drug is significantly higher in the rubbery state than in 
the glassy state of the polymer, a zero order release can be obtained, but only for 
a limited degree of release, usually around 60% from the total amount of loaded 
drug, and this only for the case of relatively low initial drug concentration (see N. 
Peppas and N. Franson, J. Polym. Sci., 21, 983-997, 1983. Another mechanism allows 
a slow drug release mediated by the tablet external bioerosion during its 
gastroenteric residence (E. Doelker and P.Buri, Pharm. Acta Helv., 56, 111-117, 
1981). This system is mainly based on starch or lipidic matrices, and the rate of 
drug release is related to the complex composition of the
