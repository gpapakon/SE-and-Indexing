<ABSTRACT>
An electrically data chip-erasable nonvolatile 
semiconductor memory wherein a write instruction 

directing a pre-erase data write is disabled and then a 
one-time test data write and an automated data erase is 

executed according to an erase instruction. The 
semiconductor memory is provided with an automated count 

setter (11A) for supplying one the preset write counts 
according to the applied voltage state of the test mode 

terminals in an automated data erase and rewrite test and 
control means (11) for controlling data write and erase 

in response to the write count from the automated count 
setter. 
A test method of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory 
comprises the steps of disabling a write instruction 

directing a pre-erase data write (a pre-programming), and 
executing a one-time test data write and a subsequent 

automated data erase according to an erase instruction. 
Another test method of the nonvolatile semiconductor 

memory comprises the steps of assigning the counts of 
pre-erase data writes to a plurality of test mode 

terminals in advance, in an automated erase and rewrite 
test, applying a test voltage higher than a usually used 

one to a selected one of the test mode terminals, 
executing a pre-programming according to a write count 

derived from the voltage state of the selected test mode 
terminal, and then executing an erase test data 

programming and an auto-erase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory and its test method, and more
specifically relates to improvements of an automatically
and electrically chip-erasable memory in which a pre-erase
write is executed in an automated erase operation.Recently, as various sorts of information processing
systems increase in their performance and the number of
their functions, nonvolatile memories has come to be used
which store the control algorithm for each system as
programmed data in memory cells.For example, in an electrically rewritable and
electrically chip-erasable memory (a flash E2P-ROM),
there are needs for an assurance of the number of
rewrites, a shorter test period and better test
efficiency.According to such conventional flash memory, in
performing an automated rewrite and erase test which
serves as a test of functions and operations of a flash
memory, a data write operation is performed on the basis
of a program command from an external device prior to an
automated erase and then an erase operation is performed
by an erase command from the external device
(Hereinafter, such data write operation or pre-erase
conditioning is referred to as "pre-programming").Thus, a rewrite test requires repetition of an
automated write which is executed prior to an automated
erase (hereinafter, referred to as an "auto-erase") based
on a program command (a pre-programming) and an automated
erase based on an erase command causing the test period
to be long and causing the data write based on the
program command to prevent a precise erase characteristic 
from being obtained.Now, the related art of the invention will be
described in the following. For example, as shown in FIG.
1A, an automatically and electrically chip-erasable
memory into which erase data are written before an auto-erase
comprises a storage section 1, a write/read section
2 and an erase/write controller 3.The erase/write controller 3 as shown in FIG. 1B
comprises a write-completion detector 4, latch circuits
5 through 7, an oscillator 8, inverters INV1 and INV2 and
a counter 9 to control inputs and outputs of the storage
section 1 and the write/read section 2 on the basis of a
test algorithm or a series of write and erase commands.Here, an erase command means the operational
instructions of writing erase data into the relevant
cells and erasing the contents of all the cells, that is,
injecting hot electrons into the cells and then repeating
an extraction of hot electrons through the F-N (Flower-Nordheim)
tunnel a few through
