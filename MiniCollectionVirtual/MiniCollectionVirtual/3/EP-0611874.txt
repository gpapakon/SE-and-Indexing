<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved subsea 
wellhead and to the method of retrieving the production 

string (58) from the wellhead and the method of retrieving the 
tree (62) from the wellhead. The wellhead includes a lower 

tubing hanger (56) landing within the wellhead housing (50) and an 
upper false tubing hanger (64) landed within the tree (62). The 

upper false tubing hanger includes preps for receiving two 
plugs (84,86) within its central bore above the radial bore (76) through 

the upper tubing hanger which communicates with the radial 
bore (78) through the tree through which production fluids flow 

from the well. A tubular member (66) extends from the upper 
false tubing hanger to the lower tubing hanger and defines 

the flow passage through which production fluids flow 
between the two hangers. A sleeve (88) surrounds the exterior 

of the tubular member and contains fluids communicated to 
the interior of the sleeve from the annulus surrounding the 

tubing string. Orienting means (71,72,74) is provided to orient the 
upper false tubing hanger as it is being landed within the 

tree so that the radial passages in the upper false tubing 
hanger and the tree are in registry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved subsea 
wellhead in which either the production string or the 
production tree may be easily and quickly recovered from 
their subsea location and readily reinstalled without the 
excessive loss of downtime normally associated with such 
operations. Prior to the present invention, the removal of either 
of the production tubing or the production tree from a 
subsea well could only be accomplished by utilizing the 
steps of their installation in the reverse order for 
recovery. This entails substantial equipment for the 
removal of the tree and for the removal of the tubing 
string. None of the known prior art allowed the easy 
removal of the production tree in any manner. EP-A-0572732, published after the priority date of the present 
application, and constituting prior art in accordance with 
Article 54(3) EPC, describes an improved 
wellhead in which the production tubing and tubing hanger 
can be retrieved without pulling the production tree. This 
art, however, requires that the production tubing be pulled 
prior to pulling the tree. There is no suggested structure 
or steps by which the tree can be removed, without first 
removing the production tubing, other than by the extended 
procedure which reverses its installation process. The present invention relates to an improved subsea 
wellhead in which the production string may be quickly and 
easily removed, or the production tree may be quickly and 
easily removed, each independent of the other. The  
 
structure includes the wellhead housing with the casing 
hangers supporting the casing strings landed in the 
housing, a tree connected to the upper end of the wellhead 
housing, an upper false tubing hanger landed in the tree 
and having communication with the production line extending 
radially out of the tree, a tubular member extending 
downwardly therefrom, an orienting lip extending downwardly 
therefrom and a sleeve extending downwardly around the 
exterior of the orienting lip and tubular member, and a 
lower tubing hanger landed within the inner casing hanger 
and having the production tubing string extending 
downwardly therefrom and an internal preparation for a 
sealing plug and any other downhole devices desired. With 
the two casing hangers, the production string can still be 
sealed with a plug when the upper hanger is removed and the 
tree is removed. In addition with this structure the 
complete production tubing string including both tubing 
hangers may be quickly and easily retrieved
