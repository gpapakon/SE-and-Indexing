<ABSTRACT>
A noise component of a video signal is reduced 
by using a three dimensional discrete cosign transform 

(3-D DCT) to determine the time frequency spectrum of 
both the video signal and the noise component, 

subtracting the time frequency spectrum of the noise 
component from the time frequency spectrum of the video 

signal, and converting the time frequency spectrum of the 

modified video signal back to the spatial time domain by 
using an inverse 3-D DCT.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system and method 
for reducing noise in a video signal. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a signal processing system and 
method of measuring and reducing a noise component of a 
video signal by using a three dimensional, 3-D, discrete 
cosine transform, DCT. A video signal may represent a first series of 
images converted to electrical energy that also may be 
transmitted, compressed, decompressed and received by a 
device which then may use the video signal to generate a 
second series of images which is ideally substantially 
similar to the first series of images. During the 
process of generating the second series of images from 
the first series of images, (i.e., any combination of the 
transmitting, compressing, decompressing, receiving, and  
 
displaying) a noise component may be added to the video 
signal so that the signal includes an image component 
representing the series of images and a noise component. 
Depending on the magnitude of the noise component, the 
second series of images may contain noise components 
which are visible to the viewer of the second series of 
images. As a consequence, video noise reduction systems 
have been developed to attempt to reduce the noise 
component of the video signal. In U.S. Pat. No. 
4,987,481 to Spear et al., the invention is a noise 
reduction system which averages from 2 to 9 frames, or 
series of images, of the video signal to determine the 
noise content in the series of images. This system, 
however, only works on the portions of the series of 
images that are similar in color and brightness in each 
image. In U.S. Patent 5,025,312 to Faroudja, the 
invention is a noise reduction system which uses 
recirculation for the portions of the series of images 
containing low level picture details and selectively 
cores the moving portions of the series of images. 
Coring consists of passing only those portions of a 
signal that have an absolute amplitude level which is 
greater than some threshold magnitude and zeroing 
components having magnitudes less than the threshold. 
Although this system may reduce the noise component of 
the series of images, the coring or recirculation process 
may add noticeable artifacts or spurious spatial 
frequency components to the series of images. Both 
coring and recirculation may also undesirably reduce the 
apparent resolution of the series of images. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,523,230 to Carlson et al., 
the invention is a noise reduction system which uses an 
octave spectrum
