<ABSTRACT>
The sensor head (1) is provided for a fibre-optic current measuring device. It has a twisted, low-birefringent (double-refracting) LB-fibre (14) which is guided around a current conductor (2) and serves to guide polarised light. With the LB-fibre (14) the Faraday rotation of the polarised light caused by the magnetic field (H) of the current (J) to be measured is detected. The LB-fibre (14) is spliced at its two ends in each case to one of two polarisation-maintaining, light-guiding HB-fibres (6, 7), one (6) of which feeds the polarised light. The two HB-fibres (6, 7) are in each case mounted next to the two splicing points (19, 20) while absorbing the torsional force caused by twisting the LB-fibre (14). The sensor head (1) is characterised by high measuring accuracy despite having a simple and robust construction.

Sensor head (1) for a fibre-optic current 
measuring device with a twisted low-birefringence fibre 

(14), guided around a current conductor (2) and serving 
to conduct polarized light, for the detection of that 

rotation of the polarized light which is caused by the 
magnetic field (H) of the current (J) to be measured, 

characterized in that the low-birefringence fibre (14) 
is spliced at its two ends in each instance with one of 

two polarization-conserving, light-conducting fibres 
(6, 7), one (6) of which supplies the polarized light, 

and is guided in a capillary (15) wound in the shape of 
a coil, which is formed of a material which is 

comparable with the material of the low-birefringence 
fibre (14) with respect to its coefficient of thermal 

expansion, and in that the two polarization-conserving 
fibres (6, 7) are secured in each instance in the 

vicinity of the two splice locations (19, 20) with the 
absorption of the torsional force generated by the 

twisting of the low-birefringence fibre (14). 
Sensor head according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the low-birefringence fibre (14) and the 

capillary (15) predominantly comprise quartz. 
Sensor head according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the capillary (15) is resiliently 

mounted on a rigid coil carrier body (16). 
Sensor head according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the capillary (15) is embedded in an elastomer 

resting on the coil carrier body (16). 
Sensor head according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the two polarization-conserving 

fibres (6, 7) are inserted in each instance at opposite 
ends into the capillary (15) and are secured to the 

capillary (15) in the region of the respective 
insertion opening by means of an adhesive connection 

(17, 18). 
Sensor head according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the adhesive connection (17, 18) includes an 

elastomer such as preferably silicone.  
 
Sensor head according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the polarization-conserving fibre 

(6) supplying the polarized light is spliced, by its 
end remote from the low-birefringence fibre (14), with 

a fibre generating polarized light. 
Sensor head according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the splice locations (19, 20) 

are formed by fusion.
