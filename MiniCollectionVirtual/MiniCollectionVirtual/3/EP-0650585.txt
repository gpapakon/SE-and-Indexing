<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for use in an optic system to detect current conditions in an environment. The sensor has a crystal member with a first waveguide extending from a top surface and a second waveguide extending from a bottom surface of a core member. Polarized light waves from a source are simultaneously communicated to the first and second waveguides. A first pressure is communicated to the top surface of the crystal member and an unknown pressure corresponding to the pressure of the environment is communicated to the bottom surface of the crystal member. The first pressure and the unknown pressure develop a pressure differential which act on the crystal member to deform the first and second waveguides. The deformation of the first and second waveguides modify the polarized light waves to create first and second output waves which are communicated to an optical interface where differences therebetween are extracted. The differences are analyzed by a computer to identify the current pressure and temperature of the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sensor for use in an 
optic system to detect conditions in an environment. The 
sensor has a crystal member with a substrate which has first 
and second waveguides extending therefrom. A source of 
polarized light waves is simultaneously presented to the 
first and second waveguides. A pressure differential 
developed from a first pressure and a different second 
pressure of the environment acts on the crystal member to 
deform the first and second waveguides. The deformation of 
the first and second waveguides modifies the polarized light 
waves to create first and second output waves. After the 
fundamental frequency of the first and second output waves 
are defined, an analyzer extracts the difference in 
frequency and phase there between to provide an input to a 
computer where the frequency and phase difference is 
compared with a reference frequency and chase to define the 
current pressure and temperature of the environment. The conditions of an environment have been 
measured through the use of a plurality of sensors which 
communicate information in the form of electrical signals to 
an indicator through bundles of copper wires. However, 
these bundles need to be shielded from extraneous forces 
which can modify the electrical signals of the sensors. 
Recently various optic sensors, which are immune to 
electromagnetic interference, such as disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 4,598,996 and 5,255,068 have been developed which 
use light carried on glass fibers to prevent extraneous 
forces from affecting output of the sensors. In these 
sensors, modification of the light wave pattern carried by 
the glass fibers are analyzed to detect the temperature of 
an environment; more specifically, a fringe pattern 
associated with light waves passing through birefringent 
crystals is decoded to determine the temperature in an 
environment. These sensors adequately detect temperature 
when used in an intended environment.  
 In evaluating the optic sensor disclosed in U.S. 
5,255,068 it was observed that the velocity of light waves 
propagating through a birefringent crystal could be shifted 
by an application of pressure to the crystal. German Patent DE-A-3 341 845 discloses a sensor 
system wherein first and second waves of polarized light are 
passed through a crystal member which separates a first 
chamber with a reference fluid pressure therein from a 
second chamber with an unknown fluid pressure therein. The 
crystal member is deformed by any pressure differential 
between the
