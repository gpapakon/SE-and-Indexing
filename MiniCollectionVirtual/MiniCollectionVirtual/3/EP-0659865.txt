<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
polymerizable liquid crystal composition which can be used as
an optical material, display material or recording material.
More particularly, the present invention relates to an
optically anisotropic film comprising a photopolymerization
product of such a polymerizable liquid crystal composition
having a high orientation state fixed therein which functions
to control light and is suitable for the application in the
field of optoelectronics, liquid crystal display, etc. The
present invention further relates to a process for the
preparation of such an optically anisotropic film. Moreover,
the present invention relates to a liquid crystal device
comprising the foregoing optically anisotropic film.In recent years, liquid crystal substances have been
applied to display media utilizing the reversible motion of
liquid crystal molecules such as display elements represented
by TN (twisted nematic) type and STN (supertwisted nematic)
type liquid crystal display elements. Besides these
applications, these liquid crystal substances have been
studied for application to optically anisotropic films such
as optical phase retardation plate, polarizing plate, light
polarizing prism and light filter taking advantage of its 
anisotropy in physical properties such as olientability,
refractive index, dielectric constant and magnetizability.In such an optically anisotropic film comprising a
liquid crystal substance as a constituent component, it is
essential that the uniform alignment of the liquid crystal be
semipermanently fixed to obtain stable and uniform optical
properties.As a method for semipermanently fixing the uniform
alignment of the liquid crystal, there has already been known
a method which comprises aligning a liquid crystalline
compound containing a polymerizable functional group or a
polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing such a
compound in liquid crystalline state, and then irradiating
the material with energy rays such as ultraviolet ray while
maintaining in the liquid crystalline state.As such a technique there may be exemplified one
employing the following liquid crystalline compound.For example, JP-A-58-102205 (The term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application") discloses as a liquid crystal compound
containing a polymerizable functional group a compound
represented by the following formula:
However, the foregoing compound is disadvantageous in
that it exhibits a nematic phase at a temperature as very
high as
