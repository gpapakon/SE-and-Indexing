<ABSTRACT>
A two part aqueous composition for coloring and providing 
durable conditioning to human hair which forms a gel on mixing of 

an alkaline aqueous lotion first part having a pH of from about 7 
to about 11 containing from about 0.005% by weight to about 5% by 

weight of at least one primary intermediate and at least one 
coupler for the formation of oxidation dyes, from about 0.1% to 

about 5% of a cationic polymer, from about 0.5% to about 15% by 
weight of an anionic or amphoteric surfactant or mixture thereof 

and at least 70% by weight water, and an aqueous developer second 
part having a pH of from about 2 to about 6 containing from about 

0.5% by weight to about 40% by weight of a peroxide oxidizer and 
from about 0.1% by weight to about 20% by weight of an anionic 

polymer, the anionic polymer being characterized in that it is 
insoluble in the developer and dissolves in the gel which forms 

when the lotion and developer are mixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oxidative, aqueous, hair coloring
compositions.When oxidation dyes of the type comprising primary
intermediates and couplers are used in the dyeing of human hair,
the procedure usually involves the use of a two part system. One
part is the lotion formulation which contains a variety of
ingredients, including the oxidation dye precursors, and forms a
gel immediately prior to application to the human hair, when
mixed with the second part, the developer formulation containing
a suitable oxidizing agent. The developer usually contains an
oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide and as a consequence
some of the natural melanin pigment of the hair may be initially
destroyed. The precursors in the lotion penetrate into the hair
and are oxidized to produce the desired color. Such systems will
generally contain 50% or more of organic solvents and
surfactants, and require relatively high levels of dye precursors
to produce the desired color.Several conditions are important for the procedures using
oxidative dyes to work properly. These include: 
1. The formulations must be stable to insure a reasonable
shelf life.2. The compositions formed by mixing the lotion and
developer must have rheological properties whereby
application, either by use of a brush or with the fingers,
can readily distribute the dye throughout the hair mass and
yet in the absence of stress, dripping or running from the
hair during the color development period can be
substantially avoided.3. The dye mixture, as applied to the hair, should allow
rapid diffusion of the dye precursors from the dye mixture
into the hair fiber.4. The mixture, while thick enough to stay in place during
the color development period should be readily rinseable
from the hair with water.5. The mixture should preferably contain conditioning
agents which leave the hair in a condition such that it is
easy to detangle while wet and also feel smooth and be
readily managed when dry.6. The lotion and developer should preferably, but not
necessarily, have comparable viscosities in order to
facilitate mixing.7. The dyeing effect should be rapid, with a dyeing time
preferably under thirty minutes.In conventional permanent hair dye products, the rheological
properties have generally been attained by the use of a dye
lotion containing a high level of surfactants and organic 
solvents to provide a thin lotion which, on mixture with a highly
aqueous developer solution of the oxidizing agent forms a dye
mixture with the desired gel-like consistency. The
