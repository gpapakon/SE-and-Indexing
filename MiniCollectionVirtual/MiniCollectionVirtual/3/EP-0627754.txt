<ABSTRACT>
A protective arrangement against current 
overloading, in particular for motor vehicle electric 

systems, with direct fuse coupling to a cable 
termination, wherein at least one fuse (69) terminal is 

placed in direct electric connection contact with a 
cable termination (70), thereby reducing the number of 

the series contact connections in the arrangement, and 
consequent voltage drop and power dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protective 
arrangement against current overloading, with direct 
fuse coupling to a cable termination, particularly for 
motor vehicle electric systems. It is a known fact that 
prior art electric systems for motor vehicles, 
automobiles, trucks, tricars, and self-propelled 
construction machines, are provided with a capillary 
protection of their electric functions using fuses 
housed in a fuse box so as to form an electric power 
distribution unit. The distribution unit is powered through a 
cable of appropriate conduction cross-section, and in 
turn powers, in cascade through a plurality of fuses 
having a suitable amperage, a plurality of electric 
apparatus, such as headlights, tail lights, parking 
lights, fans, windshield wipers, etc. In the event of a short or unacceptably 
protracted overloading of such apparatus, the fuse 
ahead operates to prevent dangerous overheating and 
destruction of the protected apparatus while also 
providing protection from fire hazard. This is specially important with vehicles 
operating on inflammables, mainly gasoline, and its 
importance is stressed by that modern cars frequently  
 
come equipped with fuel pumps and appropriate plenums 
to keep their fuel systems pressurized. In such circumstances, fire caused by shorts 
or overheating may have disastrous effects. The distribution units employed provide 
reasonable but not full protection from such hazard. In fact, the vehicle electric system includes 
a multiplicity of large supply cables extending ahead 
of the distribution unit and being unprotected from 
shorts. These cables are basically arranged to 
connect the battery to the electric starter, the 
junction box, and the charging alternator. In a manner related to the specially large 
loads they are to power, the cables have large 
cross-sections, and are kept permanently live and 
usually left unprotected. For this reason, in the event of a short 
occurring, and in the continued presence of large 
amounts of energy in the battery, overheating may be 
experienced with its attendant fire hazard and no 
apparatus provided to take actions. Attempted extensions of the protection 
against overcurrents to the battery side of the 
electric system clash with the large power dissipations  
 
and voltage drops that occur in any electric connection 
scheme upon breaking the physical continuity of the 
conducting elements and where the electric contact is 
ensured by the juxtaposition of the elements being 
maintained by a 
contact

<CLAIMS>
A protective arrangement against current 
overloading, comprising a fuse carrying box (60,88,89) 

and at least one cable termination (70) crimped and/or 
soldered to one cable end, said termination (70) being 

effective to provide electric contact with a fuse (69) 
terminal and being housed within said fuse box 

(60,88,89). 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 1, 
wherein said termination (70) is housed fixedly within 

said box (60). 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 2, 
wherein said termination (70) is locked within said box 

by elastic engagement means (47,48) which are prevented 
from becoming deformed by locking means (45,83) 

inserted into said box. 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 1, 
wherein said termination (70) is contained inside an 

insulating protection case (44) housed removably within 
said box (60). 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 1, 
comprising a plurality of said cable terminations (70) 

and a plurality of terminations (71,72) of contact with 
corresponding fuse terminals formed by a one-piece 

connection element (77) and means of securing 
 

(79,80,81) and electrically connecting said one-piece 
element (75) to at least one electric cable. 
A protective arrangements as in the 
preceding claims, wherein said cable terminations (70) 

and/or contact terminations (71,72) comprise a 
prismatic conductive element having a contact comb (30) 

opposite to a contact wall (27) to establish at least a 
triple contact with at least a contact spot and a pair 

of contact spots, on opposed faces of a flat fuse 
terminal, and a mechanical element (37) fast with said 

prismatic conductive element and provided with an 
elastic comb (38) juxtaposed to said contact comb (30) 

for imposing a contact pressure through the contact 
comb (30) and said contact wall (27). 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 6, 
wherein said cable termination (43) is provided with 

engagement means (41) and inserted into an insulating 
prismatic case (44) provided with elastic means (47,48) 

co-operating with said engagement means (41) to prevent 
withdrawal of said cable termination (43) from said 

case (44), said case (44) comprising a housing (52) for 
a locking element (45) effective to inhibit elastic 

deformation of said elastic means (47,48). 
An arrangement as in Claim 7, wherein said 
case (44) is integral with said box (60). 
A protection arrangement as in Claim 7, 
wherein said insulating case (44) is inserted removably 

into said box (60) and provided with keyed insertion 
means (57) to prevent said case (44) from being 

inserted the wrong way up. 
A protective arrangement as in Claim 9, 
wherein said insulating case (44) is provided with 

engagement means (56) co-operating with corresponding 
engagement means of said box (60) to prevent said case 

from being withdrawn from said box.
