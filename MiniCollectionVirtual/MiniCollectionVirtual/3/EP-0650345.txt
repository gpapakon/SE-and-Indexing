<ABSTRACT>
A steam sterilizable unit (10) for inactivating pathogens in a body fluid is provided comprising a plastic structure for housing a therapeutically effective amount of a methylene blue solution. The plastic structure preferably includes at least an inner layer (128) constructed from a non-PVC plastic. Preferably, the methylene blue solution has a pH of less than 7.0 and preferably less than or equal to approximately 6.3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates
to a steam sterilizable structure including a container
for housing body fluids and solutions and is
concerned with inactivating viral contaminants that may be present in
the body fluids.In a variety of therapies, such as transfusions and
transplants, body fluids, especially blood components
such as red blood cells, platelets, plasma, leukocytes,
and bone marrow, are infused from one or more individuals
into a patient. Although such therapies provide
treatments, some of which are life saving, and cannot
otherwise be provided, due to the transmission of
infectious diseases there may be potential risks involved
with such therapies.By way of example, it is known that blood can carry
infectious agents such as hepatitis virus, human immuno-deficiency
virus (an etiological agent for AIDS), and
herpes virus. Although screening methods exist to
identify blood that may include such viruses, blood
containing viruses, and other disease causing pathogens,
such as bacteria, cannot be 100% eliminated from the pool
of possible blood component supplies. Therefore, there
is still a small risk that blood transfusions can
transmit viral or other infections.Accordingly, a goal of recent biomedical research
has been to reduce the risk of transmitting an infectious
agent by selectively inactivating or depleting pathogens 
present in such blood components. One approach has been
to utilize photosensitive (photoactive) agents that when
activated by light of the appropriate wavelength will
destroy the ability of the pathogen to cause infection.
The use of photodynamic therapy has been suggested as a
way to eradicate infectious agents from collected blood
and its components prior to storage and/or transfusion.A number of different photoactive agents have been
proposed as possibilities to be used to eradicate viral
and other contaminants in body fluids. Such photoactive
agents include: psoralens; porphyrins; phthalocyanines;
and dyes such as methylene blue. See, for example, U.S.
Patent Nos.: 4,748,120; 4,878,891; 5,120,649; and German
Patent Application No. DE 39 30 510 A1 (Mohr).Although much effort has been focussed on
commercializing such methods using photoactive agents,
the inventors believe that such methods are currently not
commercial. Even though a commercial system for
utilizing a photoactive agent to treat blood to eradicate
or remove viral and other contaminants has not been
developed, it is envisioned that such a system would
entail combining the blood with the photoactive agent in
a

<CLAIMS>
A steam sterilizable structure, including a plastics container (112)
whose inner surface is constructed from PVC, characterised by a tube

(120) containing a therapeutically effective amount of methylene blue and
connected to the container (112), the inner surface of the tube being

constructed of a non-PVC material chosen so that methylene blue stored
therein will not substantially migrate into the material, and openable

means (123,125) to allow the methylene blue to be run into the container
from the tube.
The structure of Claim 1, wherein the non-PVC plastic is at least
one plastic chosen from polypropylene, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene,

ethylenevinyl acetate, polyester and polyurethane.
The structure of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the tube (120) is constructed
from a mono-layer material.
The structure of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the tube (120) is constructed
from a multi-layer material.
The structure of any preceding claim, wherein the tube (120) is
sealed to PVC material of the container.
The structure of Claim 4, wherein an outer layer of the multi-layer
material is sealed to the PVC material of the container (112).
The structure of any preceding claim, including a further tube for
allowing a body fluid to flow into the container. 
The structure of any preceding claim, wherein the methylene blue
is in a solution with a pH of less than 7.0.
The structure of Claim 8, wherein the methylene blue solution has
a pH of less than or equal to 6.3.
A method for storing a body fluid and inactivating pathogens
contained therein comprising the steps of steam sterilizing the structure of

any preceding claim, opening said openable means (123,125) and running
methylene blue from the tube (120) into the container (112), mixing the

body fluid with the methylene blue in the interior of the container (112)
of the structure and irradiating the container with light of a sufficient

wavelength to activate the methylene blue.
The method of Claim 10, comprising transferring the body fluid
into the container (112) through said tube (120) to cause the body fluid to

mix with the methylene blue.
