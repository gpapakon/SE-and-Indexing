<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pyrotechnic material in sheet 
form which is especially useful in inflators for gas bags of 
vehicle occupant restraint safety systems and in ignition 
systems, for example, in gas generators, rocket motors, shock 
wave transmission tubes and pyrotechnic signals. Pyrotechnic sheet material consisting of one or more 
substrate layers of oxidizing polymeric film having a layer 
of oxidizable material, preferably metal, on at least a 
portion of at least one surface of the, or each, substrate 
layer, the polymeric film and the oxidizable material being 
conjointly capable of reacting together exothermically on 
ignition, has been described in PCT International Publications 
Nos. WO 90/10611 and WO 90/10724. The use of pyrotechnic sheet material to ignite a 
propellant gas-generating charge has been described in our 
European patent publication no. 505024 and hybrid inflators 
containing gas heating elements comprising pyrotechnic sheet 
material to heat a supply of stored gas have been described 
in our United Kingdom patent specification no. GB 2264772A and 
European patent publication no. 559,335. The rate of combustion of a propellant charge, 
particularly a sheet propellant can be substantially increased 
by providing a space or channel adjacent to the propellant 
charge through which hot gas and flame from the burning 
propellant can travel ahead of the burning face of the 
propellant and ignite the propellant at downstream positions. 
An especially effective method of providing such a flame 
conducting space in a sheet propellant charge is by disposing 
spacer elements between overlapping parallel propellant sheets 
which may for example be disposed in parallel planes or 
wrapped co-axially or spirally to form a cylindrical charge. 
The spacer elements may be formed as projecting portions of 
the propellant sheet as in the propellant charges described 
in US Patent Specification No. 4408534, and UK Patent  
 
Specification Nos. 457423 and 1,278,116. Likewise the rate 
and violence of a pyrotechnic sheet such as that described in 
PCT International Publications Nos. WO 90/10611 and WO 
90/10724 may be enhanced by providing a space adjacent to the 
surface of the sheet to allow the passage of flame and hot 
combustion products to cause downstream (flashover) ignition. In previously available pyrotechnic sheet material of the 
kind consisting of an oxidizing substrate layer and an 
overlying layer of oxidizable material reactable therewith, 
both of the layers have been
