<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to indole 
derivatives which act on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 
receptors. More particularly the present invention relates to 
3,5-disubstituted indoles which are selective agonists 
at the "5-HT₁-like" subtype of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 
receptor. Such "5-HT₁-like" receptors are present in 
the carotid vascular bed and their activation causes 
vasoconstriction with a consequent reduction in carotid 
blood flow. Compounds which have "5-HT₁-like" agonist 
activity are therefore useful in the treatment of 
medical conditions which are thought to result from 
excessive dilation of the carotid bed, such as 
migraine, cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal 
hemicrania and headache associated with vascular 
disorders. Certain compounds of the present invention 
are also agonists at central 5-HT₁ receptors and are 
therefore useful for the treatment of depression, 
anxiety, eating disorders, obesity and drug abuse. The present invention provides compounds of 
formula: 
 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,
