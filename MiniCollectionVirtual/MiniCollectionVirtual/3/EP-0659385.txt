<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interface 
network for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
spectroscopy systems to enhance the imaging performance and 
spectroscopy sensitivity of such instruments when evaluating 
anatomical regions small in size relative to the body, 
and deep within the body, but proximate a location where an 
insertable pickup probe could be used. Specifically, the 
present invention can be used with an intracavity pickup 
probe designed to image the prostate region by rectal introduction, 
to image the cervix region by vaginal introduction, 
or the like. In the field of MRI systems, also commonly known 
as NMR imaging systems, external pickup probes are typically 
used for receiving radio frequency signals from the region 
of interest. For optimum performance however, the 
pickup probe should be insertable for intracavity use and 
which includes a radio frequency receiving coil, to be positioned 
as close to the region of interest as possible. In 
addition, the insertable pickup probe should also have a 
sensitive volume equaling the desired field of view of the 
region of interest. This allows optimization of the "filling 
factor" and "coupling coefficient" for the specific 
MRI system, thereby improving signal to noise ratio in MR 
imaging.  Furthermore, for optimum sensitivity, the 
receiving coil should have an unloaded coil quality factor 
(Q) which is as great as possible and should be adjusted to 
resonate at the exact Larmour frequency of the scanner of 
the MRI system. It also sometimes is desired that the insertable, 
intracavity pickup probe be disposable, and hence 
the cost of the probe should be minimized as much as possible. 
At the same time, it is important that in reducing the 
cost of the probe, the ability to impedance match and tune 
the receiving coil to the scanner of the MRI system not be 
compromised. Therefore, there is a need to provide an interface 
network for a disposable pickup probe for use in a 
MRI system which is capable of automatically or manually 
tuning and impedance matching the receiving coil to the 
scanner of the MRI system. It is a primary object of the present invention 
to provide an interface network having the ability to match 
the coil of the pickup probe to the resonant frequency of 
an MRI scanner in an MRI system.  It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide an interface system 
having the ability to perform resonant frequency adjustments from 
a remote location after the probe is inserted into the body
