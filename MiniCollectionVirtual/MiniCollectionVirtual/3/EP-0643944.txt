<ABSTRACT>
The blood sampling device comprises a relatively flexible inner tube (11) and an outer tube (10). There is an annular gap (12) between the two tubes. At its front end the inner tube (11) has a front wall (30) which presses against the annular protuberance (43) of a front wall (13) of the outer tube. For mutual fixation of inner and outer tube, an engagement profile is provided on the edge of the front wall (30) of the inner tube and engages in locking fashion with a counter-profile of the outer tube. On centrifugation, the inwardly directed protuberance becomes buried in the soft material of the front wall (30) of the inner tube. This prevents liquid from reaching the annular gap (12) on centrifugation.

<CLAIMS>
A blood-taking device with a radially expandable inner tubule (11), a comparatively
rigid outer tubule (10) surrounding said inner tubule with an annular gap (12), and a

separating member (33) contained in said inner tubule (11), said inner (11) and said
outer tubules (10) being clamped together at their respective front ends, whereby said

tubules are fixed with respect to each other, the front end of said outer tubule (10)
having an end wall (13) with a cannula hub (17),

wherein also said inner tubule (11) has an end wall (30) at its front end, the edge of this
end wall being shaped as a locking profile (40) cooperating with a counter profile (44)

of said outer tubule (10) in a locking and sealing manner.
The blood-taking device of claim 1, wherein said locking profile (40) is an outwardly
directed annular protrusion on the inner tubule (11) and said counter profile (44) is an

annular depression on the inner surface of a strengthened portion (42) of said outer
tubule.
The blood-taking device of claim 1 or 2, wherein said end wall (13) of said outer
tubule (10) has at least one annular protrusion (43) surrounding the channel (15) of said

cannula hub (17), said protrusion sinking into the soft material of said inner tubule (11).
The blood-taking device of claim 1 or 2, wherein said end wall (30) of said inner
tubule (11) has at least one annular protrusion (45) surrounding the channel of said

cannula hub (17), said protrusion being pressed flat by said end wall of said outer
tubule.
The blood-taking device of claim 3, wherein said protrusion (43) has a tip directed
towards said end wall (30) of the inner tubule (11). 
The blood-taking device of one of claims 1 to 5, wherein a centrifuge insert (58) is
provided which has a receptacle for a cannula hub (17) containing a pierceable membrane

(18), a pin (64) being disposed in said receptacle for supporting said membrane
(18).
The blood-taking device of one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the rear portion of said
inner tubule (11) is provided with a braking groove (46) extending circumferentially on

the inside thereof and receiving said plunger surface (34) of said separating member
(33) in locking engagement, and that the wall of said inner tubule (11) has a strengthened

wall portion (47) behind said braking groove (46).
