<ABSTRACT>
Crop-engaging element of an axial separating device or axial separating device with a rotor and with crop-engaging elements attached to its circumferential surface. An axial separating device has a rotor with crop-engaging elements (44) which contain a fastening plate (46) seated on the rotor and a crop-engagement plate (48) adjoining the fastening plate (46) obliquely.

<CLAIMS>
A crop engaging element (44) of an axial flow separator (24), with a mounting plate (46), from
which extends a crop engaging plate (48), characterized in that the crop engaging plate (48) runs

at an acute angle to the mounting plate (46) and in that a lip (58) adjoins the side of the crop
engaging plate (48) remote from the mounting plate (46) and runs at a right angle to the mounting

plate (46).
A crop engaging element according to claim 1, characterized in that an inclined leading edge (56)
is provided on the crop engaging plate (48).
A crop engaging element according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that a
plurality of mounting bores (52) and/or mounting slots (54) are provided in the mounting plate

(46).
An axial flow separator with a rotor (39) rotatably mounted in a rotor housing (38) and on whose
outer peripheral surface crop engaging elements (44), especially according to one or more of the

preceding claims 1 to 3, are arranged each by means of a mounting plate (46), from each of
which a crop engaging plate (48) extends outwardly, characterized in that the crop engaging plate

(48) runs at an acute angle to the mounting plate (46) and in that a lip (58) adjoins the side of the
crop engaging plate (48) remote from the mounting plate (46) and runs at a right angle to the

mounting plate (46).
An axial flow separator according to claim 4, characterized in that mounting holes (42) are
provided in the peripheral surface of the rotor (39) or in hollow bearers (40) fitted thereon.
An axial flow separator according to one or more of the preceding claims 4 and 5, characterized
in that the crop engaging elements (44) can be fixed in various attitudes relative to the axis of

rotation of the rotor (39) by means of mounting holes and bores (42, 52) in the crop engaging
elements (44) and the rotor (39) or the hollow bearers (40).
An axial flow separator according to one or more of the preceding claims 4 to 6, characterized in
that the crop engaging elements (44a) are arranged on the rotor in a threshing region at an angle

of 20° and/or the crop engaging elements (44b) are arranged on the rotor in a separator region at 
an angle of 10° and/or the crop engaging elements (44c) are arranged on the rotor in a discharge

region at an angle of 0° to the axis or rotation of the rotor (39).
