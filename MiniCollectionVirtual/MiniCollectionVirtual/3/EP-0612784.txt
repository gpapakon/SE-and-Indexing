<ABSTRACT>
Polysuccinimide and polyaspartic acid are prepared by polymerising maleic anhydride, ammonia and water or maleic acid derivatives or fumaric acid derivatives in the absence of solvents or dissolved in solvents in a twin-screw extruder. The polysuccinimide obtained can be converted into polyaspartic acid and polyaspartic acid salts by hydrolysis.
