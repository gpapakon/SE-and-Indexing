<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine intake valve operating 
mechanism for two intake valves having a separate driving 

rocker arm (38,40) for each valve and two free rocker arms (37,40) not 
connected to the intake valves. In a low-speed operating 

range, the driving rocker arms (38,40) are in their disconnecting 
states from the free rocker arms (37,40), so that both intake 

valves are opened and closed by a second cam (33) and a fourth 
cam (35). In a medium-speed operating range, the first free 

rocker arm (37) and the first driving rocker arm (38) are 
inter-connected, 

so that one of the intake valves is opened and 
closed by a first cam (32) and the other intake valve continues 

to be opened and closed by the fourth cam (35). In a high-speed 
operating range, the first driving rocker arm (38), the 

second free rocker arm (39) and the second driving rocker arm (40) 
are connected to one another, so that both the intake 

valves are opened and closed by a third cam (34). This reduces 
the equivalent inertial mass during connection of rocker 

arms and enables an increase in output and a reduction in 
fuel consumption in an internal combustion engine 

operating in multi-stages depending upon operating 
conditions of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve operating 
device according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Such valve operating devices have been already known, 
for example, from Japanese Utility Model Publication 
No. 6801/91 and the like. In the above prior art device, four cams having 
different profiles are provided to come into sliding 
contact with four rocker arms disposed adjacent one 
another, including two rocker arms independently 
operatively connected to a pair of intake valves, so that 
the connection and disconnection of adjacent rocker arms 
can be switched from each other, and the operating 
characteristics of the pair of intake valves can be 
switched through at least four or more stages. However, 
the rocker arm corresponding to the high-speed cam having 
the profile corresponding to the high-speed operating 
range of the engine is disposed at one end of the 
arrangement of adjoining rocker arms, so that both the 
intake valves are opened and closed by the high-speed cam 
in a condition in which all the rocker arms have been 
connected together in the high-speed operating range of 
the engine. For this reason, during operation of the 
engine at a high speed, the equivalent inertial mass of  
 
all the rocker arms is increased. If the spring constant 
of a valve spring for biasing the engine valve in a 
closing direction is set at a value suitable for the low-speed 
operating range in which the rocker arms are not 
connected, the bounce revolution-number, which is the 
lower limit number of revolutions of an engine which 
permits the engine valve to be reopened after full 
seating, is reduced to cause degradation of output and 
fuel consumption in the high-peed operating range. If 
the spring constant of the valve spring is set at a large 
value to avoid the reduction in the bounce revolution-number, 
the valve-operating friction is increased in the 
low-speed operating range of the engine no cause a 
mechanical pumping loss.  
 From document GB-21 97 686 A there is known a similar valve 
operating device in which four cams having different profiles are 
provided to come into sliding contact with four rocker arms 
disposed adjacent to one another, including two rocker arms 
independently operatively connected to a pair of intake valves, 
so that the connection and disconnection of the adjacent rocker 
arms can be switched from each other, and the operating 
characteristics of the pair of intake valves can be switched 
through at least four or more stages. However, the rocker arm
