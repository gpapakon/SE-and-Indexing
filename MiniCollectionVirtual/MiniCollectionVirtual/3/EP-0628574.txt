<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst is provided for polymerization of 
olefin. The catalyst is formed by bringing into contact a 

metallocene compound, an ionizing ionic compound, an 
organometallic compound, and an inorganic oxide having 

surface hydroxyl substituted partly or entirely by 
halogen. A process for polymerization of olefin is also 

provided which employs the above catalyst. This catalyst 
enables production of polyolefin having excellent physical 

properties in a well-regulated powder shape in high 
efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for 
polymerization of olefin formed from a metallocene 
compound, an ionizing ionic compound, an organometallic 
compound, and an inorganic oxide in which the surface 
hydroxyl is substituted by halogen. The present invention 
also relates to a process for polymerization of olefin 
employing the above catalyst. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 3-197513 
discloses polymerization of ethylene by use of a 
metallocene compound and an organoaluminum compound as the 
catalyst. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 3-290408 
discloses production of polyethylene or ethylene 
copolymer by use of a zirconocene compound, an 
organoaluminum compound, and an organomagnesium compound. 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 58-19309 
(Kaminsky et al.) and other papers disclose catalysts 
employing a metallocene and methylaluminoxane for 
production of polyolefin including polypropylene with high 
catalytic activity. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No. 63-51407 discloses suspension or gas-phase 
polymerization of olefin with a catalyst formed from a 
metallocene and methylaluminoxane as the catalyst 
components, one or both of the catalyst components being 
supported on an inorganic oxide carrier such as silica.  
 
However, such catalyst systems require use of a large 
amount of relatively expensive methylaluminoxane to 
produce a polymer having industrially useful properties. 
Therefore, such catalyst systems have disadvantages of 
high cost, and a large amount of residual aluminum in the 
polymer, and so forth. Recently, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
Nos. 3-124706 and 3-207704 disclosed catalysts having high 
activity in polymerization of olefin including propylene, 
prepared by combining an ionic metallocene with an 
organoaluminum compound. The specifications of these 
patent applications show that the ionic metallocene 
catalyst, the main catalyst, needs to be prepared by 
converting a chloride of a metallocene compound into a 
methyl derivative by a methylating agent such as 
methyllithium or methylmagnesium chloride and subsequent 
reaction of the resulting methyl derivative with an 
ionizing ionic compound. However, the methyl derivatives 
of the metallocene compounds and the ionizing metallocene 
catalysts disclosed are generally unstable and can be 
synthesized only through several complicated steps of high 
technical level. Therefore, such catalyst systems involve 
various disadvantages such as low purity of the catalyst, low 
repr
