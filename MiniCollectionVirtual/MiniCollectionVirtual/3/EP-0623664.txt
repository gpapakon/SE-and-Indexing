<ABSTRACT>
Process for hydroreforming in the presence of a catalyst including at least one refractory inorganic support, platinum, optionally at least one metal of group VIII, a halogen (palladium, nickel and ruthenium) and at least one additional metal M chosen from germanium, tin, lead, gallium, indium and thallium, in which process the said metal M is introduced, in the form of at least one organic compound, in situ into the reactor where the hydrocarbon feedstock will be subsequently treated or into a prereactor connected to the said reactor.

<CLAIMS>
A process for hydroreforming in the presence of a
catalyst containing at least one carrier, platinum, at least

one additional metal M selected from the group made up of
germanium, tin, lead, gallium, indium, rhenium, tungsten,

and thallium, and a halogen, process in which the catalyst
is obtained by introducing into a calcined and activated

catalytic mass, referred to as a precatalyst and which
includes at least one carrier and platinum, at least one

organic compound of at least one additional metal M, with
this additional metal M being introduced in pure or dilute

form, 
in situ,
 into the reaction zone where the treatment of
a charge is to be done in the presence of said catalyst or

in a prereaction zone that is in direct contact with the
reaction zone, said introduction being accomplished under an

inert or reducing atmosphere.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the
catalyst is prepared according to a process that includes

the following sequence of stages :

(a) in the first stage of this preparation ; a
precatalyst is prepared off site which contains at least

said carrier and platinum, with the precatalyst being
subjected to drying and to calcining at this stage ;
(b) the precatalyst is introduced into a reaction zone
where the charge will be sent to be treated by said catalyst

or to a prereaction zone directly connected to said reaction
zone ;
(c) the precatalyst is then subjected to an activation
treatment in an inert or reducing atmosphere ; and 

(d) in a second stage of said preparation, said
additional metal M is introduced into the precatalyst by

bringing at least one organic compound of said additional
metal M into contact with the precatalyst under an inert or

reducing atmosphere.
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2,
wherein the precatalyst also contain a metal from Group

VIII.
A process according to one of claims 1-3, wherein
the precatalyst contains at least a halogen or a halogen

compound.
A process according to one of claims 1-4, wherein
the organic compound of the additional metal M is

introduced in the liquid or gaseous phase.
A process according to one of claims 1-5, wherein
the organic compound of the additional metal M is introduced

onto the catalyst in at least one impregnation

solvent, which is a hydrocarbon solution.
A process according to one of claims 1-6, wherein
the activation of the precatalyst is accomplished in a

reducing atmosphere in the presence of hydrogen, between
300 and 600°C.
A process according to claim 7, wherein, upon the
completion of preparation of the catalyst (before the

charge to be treated is contacted with the catalysts), the
impregnation solvent of the additional metal M is

eliminated, and then heat treatment is carried out.
A process according to claim 8, wherein said heat
treatment is carried out under a stream of hydrogen at a

temperature of between 300 and 600°C.
A process according to one of claims 1-9, wherein
the additional metal M is introduced into the precatalyst 

in the form of at least one organometallic or alcoholate
compound.
A process according to claim 10, wherein said
organometallic or alcoholate compound is selected from the

group composed of carbonylic or polyketonic complexes of
metals M, and the hydrocarbyl metals of metal M such as

alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls, alkylaryls, and arylalkyls.
A process according to one of claims 1-10,
wherein said organic compound of metal M is selected from

the group composed of tetrabutyl tin, tetramethyl tin,
tetrapropyl germanium, diphenyl tin, and tetraethyl lead,

indium acetylacetonate, thallium acetylacetonate, thallium
ethanolate, and triethyl gallium.
A process according to one of claims 6-12,
wherein said impregnation solvent of said metal M is

selected from the group composed of the organic oxygenated
solvents containing 2-8 carbon atoms per molecule,

paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons
containing 6-15 carbon atoms per molecule, and halogenated

organic compounds containing 1-15 carbon atoms per
molecule.
A process according to claim 13, wherein the
impregnation solvent is selected from the group consisting

of ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, n-heptane, methylcyclohexane,
toluene, and chloroform.
A process according to one of the preceding
claims, wherein hydroreforming takes place at a temperature

of between 400 and 600°C, at a pressure of between 0.1 and
3.5 MPa, and at an hourly rate of between 0.1 and 10

volumes of liquid charge per volume of catalyst, with the
ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon being between 1 and 20.
A process according to one of the preceding
claims, wherein the temperature is between 480°C and 580°C, 

the pressure is between 0.2 and 1.8 MPa, the hourly rate is
