<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge-holder locking device for use with a 
magnetooptical disk player includes a biasing device (3) 

for resiliently biasing a cartridge holder (2) away from 
a deck (1), a locking pin (4) fixed to the cartridge 

holder (2); and a locking/releasing device (5, 6) 
installed on said deck (1) for locking or releasing 

engagement with the locking pin (4). The device features 
relatively few components and has a simplified structure 

allowing fast opening/loading speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cartridge-holder locking
device and, particularly but not exclusively to such a
device for use with a magnetooptical disk player.
Such a locking device having the precharacterising features of
claim 1 is known from EP-A-0048759.The development of magnetooptical disk cartridges of
a 64mm diameter (commercially referred to as "minidisks")
has been under way since the minidisk was first introduced
(by Sony of Japan).A portable player (Sony model MZ-1) for recording and
playback operations with the minidisk, is on the market.
This player has a slot into which a minidisk is
insertable. A minidisk cartridge is loaded into the deck
by the driving force of a motor, with a shutter of the
cartridge being moved aside to open a communicating
aperture. The cartridge is thereafter mounted on a
turntable and rotated by a spindle motor during
playback/recording operations.In general, it is desirable that a portable player
should be as light and small as possible, allow the rapid
insertion/extraction of a disk cartridge, and have a very
low power consumption. However, due to the specific
construction of the insertion means, i.e., via a slot, the
Sony minidisk player has a complicated structure for
insertion/extraction of cartridges. Furthermore, due to
limitations which are imposed on the player by providing
it with a motorized loading mechanism, it is difficult to
miniaturize and reduce the weight of the player and to
speed up the inserting and extracting operations thereof.
A further disadvantage is that utilising a motorized
loading mechanism to insert and/or extract the minidisk 
increases the player's overall power consumption.
Accordingly, battery power cannot be efficiently utilized.Therefore, it is an aim of
the invention to provide a cartridge holder locking device
in which the number of components for use in opening and
loading the cartridge holder may be reduced, so as to
miniaturize and lighten a player, such as a magnetooptical
disk player which incorporates the locking device, to
increase opening and loading speeds and to reduce overall
power consumption. This aim is achieved by the characterising
features of appended claim 1. The invention also includes a magnetooptical disk player
provided with a cartridge-holder locking device.EP-A-0 503 937 discloses a locking device with a slide plate, which slide plate is urged
to its locking position by a tension spring extending from a protrusion on the slide
plate to a protrusion of the player deck. For a better understanding of the

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge-holder locking device comprising:

a cartridge holder (2) pivotally connected to a deck
(1) of a player, the cartridge holder (2) being adapted

for the reception of a cartridge;
means (3) for resiliently biasing said cartridge
holder (2) away from said deck;
a locking pin (4) fixed to said cartridge holder; and
locking/releasing means provided on the deck (1) for
locking or releasing engagement with said locking pin (4)

characterised in that said locking/releasing means
comprises:
a guide pin (7) fixed to said deck;
a slide plate (5) installed on said player deck (1)
and having an elongate guide hole (5a) formed therein for

co-operation with said guide pin (7) so as to enable
rectilinear movement of said slide plate (5);
an actuator installed on said player deck for moving
said slide plate (5); and
a locking piece (6) formed on said slide plate (5)
for locking and releasing said locking pin (4) using said

actuator;

wherein said actuator comprises: 
a solenoid (8) connected to said slide plate (5) so
as to enable movement of the slide plate (5) to release

said locking pin (4); and
a compression spring (9) installed between said solenoid (8) and
said slide plate (5) so as to restore said slide plate (5)

to an initial position.
A magnetooptical disk player provided with a
cartridge-holder locking device in accordance with any of

the preceding claims.
