<ABSTRACT>
A method of levelling a pallet load includes providing 
at least two pallets (24, 26) and a pre-determined 

combination of containers and void fillers (20a and b). 
The combination of containers (22) and void fillers (20a 

and b) are placed upon a first pallet (24) that has 
generally flat, horizontal top (28) and bottom (30) 

surfaces. The combination of containers (22) and void 
fillers (20) defines a horizontal plane upon which a second 

pallet (26), which has generally flat top (28) and bottom 
(30) surfaces, is stacked.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a method of 
levelling a pallet load using a combination of containers 
and void fillers. More specifically, this disclosure 
illustrates a method of levelling a pallet load using a 
standard plastic container, and a void filler which may be 
expanded into a rigid configuration and collapsed into a 
generally flat configuration for storage. A typical prior art method for levelling a pallet load 
places a plurality of containers on a first pallet in a 
pre-determined configuration and thereafter stacks a second 
pallet on top of the containers. Each container must be 
identical in height so that the second pallet can be 
stacked upon a level, horizontal plane which is defined by 
the containers. A container is placed at each corner of 
the pallet, and if the pallet is large, a container is 
additionally placed in the centre of the pallet. While this prior art method effectively levels a 
pallet load, a disadvantage occurs in that each container 
must be identical in height. However, in practice, in 
order to minimize storage space for goods in a warehouse, 
the goods are placed into containers of unequal heights and 
sizes. Under this prior art method, in order to ship the 
goods, the goods must be placed into containers of equal 
height. Thus, container space is often wasted since the 
goods do not completely fill the containers. Furthermore, 
often times a shipment of goods will not fill up all of the 
containers that are required to level the pallet under this 
method. Therefore, extra containers and container space 
are wasted. The present invention is intended to overcome or 
minimize all of these problems, as well as to present 
several other improvements. According to a first aspect of this invention, a 
method for levelling a pallet load comprises:
 
 
   placing a pre-determined combination of at least one 
container and at least one void filler on a first pallet 
such that a generally level, horizontal plane is defined; 
and,
 
   placing a second pallet on top of said combination of 
at least one container and void filler. According to a second aspect of this invention, a 
method of levelling a pallet load comprising:
 
   providing a void filler comprising an outer housing 
including a bottom wall, a top wall, and two side walls, 
said side walls of said outer housing extending upwardly 
from said bottom wall of said outer housing to said top 
wall of said outer housing, an inner core having a 
substantially diamond shaped configuration disposed within

shaped configuration disposed within said outer housing, 

said inner core including foot members (54, 56) and side 
walls, said foot members (54, 56) being attached to said 

side walls (58) of said outer housing, said side walls 
(58) of said inner core including diagonal members (60, 62) 

extending from each foot member (54, 56) and being joined 
at an apex; 

   providing a container (22) having a bottom wall and 
upstanding side walls having upper margins; 

   providing first and second pallets (24, 26), each of 
said pallets having generally flat, horizontal top (28) and 

bottom (30) surfaces; 
   placing a pre-determined combination of at least one 

said container (22) and at least one said void filler (20) 
on said first pallet (24) so as to define a horizontal 

plane spaced above said first pallet (24), said at least 
one container (22) being disposed such that said upper 

margins are horizontal, said at least one void filler 
being disposed such that said top (38) and bottom (40) 

walls of said outer housing are horizontal and said side 
walls (44) of said inner core are vertical; and

 
   placing said second pallet (26) on said horizontal 

plane at the top of said pre-determined combination.

container (22) and void filler (20b) is of the same height. 
A method as defined in claim 1 or 2, further 
including the step of: 

   placing a void filler (20a) on top of a container (22) 
to form a container/void filler combination, said 

container/void filler combination being of the same height 
as another container (22) in said first-mentioned 

combination.
