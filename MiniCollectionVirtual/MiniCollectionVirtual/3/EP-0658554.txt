<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical N-benzyl 
dihydroindole compounds, their use and preparation. European Patent Application 0469833 (published 
February 5, 1992) describes various N-benzyl-indoles and 
their utility as LTD₄ antagonists. It is a suprising discovery of this invention that 
hydrogenated indoles (dihydroindoles) have utility as LTD₄ 
antagonists together with increased bioavailability and 
solubility compared to prior art compounds. The compounds of the invention are of the formula I 
Another aspect of the invention are pharmaceutical 
formulations containing the novel compounds of formula (I). Still another aspect of this invention is a method 
of treating an animal, including a human, for a disease in 
which leukotrienes are a causal mediator. The compounds of the invention are leukotriene 
antagonists. The compounds of the invention are of the formula 
(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; 
wherein
 
   R¹ is hydrogen, halo, C₁₋₄ alkyl, C₁₋₄ alkoxy, 
nitrile, optionally protected carboxy, optionally protected 
tetrazolyl, trihalomethyl, hydroxy-C₁₋₄ alkyl, aldehydo,

carboxy or optionally protected tetrazolyl;
 
   R² is halo, nitrile, an optionally protected acid 
group, C₁₋₄ alkoxy-carbonyl, or -CONR⁷R⁸ where R⁷ and R⁸ are 
each hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl;
 
   R³ and R⁴ are each hydrogen, C₁₋₄ alkyl, optionally 
substituted phenyl, or C₁₋₄ alkyl substituted by -CONR⁷R⁸ or 
an optionally protected acid group;
 
   R⁵ is selected from the following four formulae:  where W is -CH=CH-, -CH=N-, -N=CH-, -O- or -S-, R⁹ is 
hydrogen, halo, C₁₋₄ alkyl, C₁₋₄ alkoxy or trihalomethyl, and 
R¹⁰ is hydrogen, C₁₋₄ alkyl, C₂₋₆ alkenyl, C₃₋₆ cycloalkyl or 
C₁₋₄ alkyl-C₃₋₆ cycloalkyl; R⁶ is hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl;
 
   each X is independently selected from, -O-(CH₂)n-CR¹¹R¹²-, 
-S-(CH₂)n-CR¹¹R¹²-, -CR¹¹R¹²-, -CR¹¹R¹²-(CH₂)n-CR¹³R¹⁴- 
or -CR¹¹=CR¹²-, where R¹¹,R¹²,R¹³ and R¹⁴ are each 
hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl;
 
   n is 0, 1 or 2; and
 
   Y is -O-CR¹⁵R¹⁶-, -S-CR¹⁵R¹⁶-, -CR¹⁵=CR¹⁶- or 
-CR¹⁵R¹⁶-CR¹⁷R¹⁸- where R¹⁵, R¹⁶, R¹⁷ and R¹⁸ are each hydrogen 
or C₁₋₄ alkyl. In the above formula (I), a halo substituent can be 
for example, chloro, bromo and fluoro and is preferably 
chloro. A C₁₋₄ alkyl group includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, 
isopropyl, butyl and tert-butyl and is preferably methyl or 
ethyl, and a C₁₋₄ alkoxy group is one such alkyl group 
attached through oxygen. A hydroxy-C₁₋₄ alkyl group is a 
hydroxy-substituted C₁₋₄
