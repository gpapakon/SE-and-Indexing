<ABSTRACT>
A lithium secondary battery with a large capacity 
and a long cycle life is disclosed. This lithium secondary 

battery includes a case (1), a negative electrode 
(6) accommodated in the case (1) and containing a poly-meric 

material which has been formed by heat-treating a 
polymer having a perynaphthalene structure as a main 

repeating unit in a non-oxidizing atmosphere at 500 to 
1000°C and which absorbs and desorbs lithium ions, a 

positive electrode (4) accommodated in the case (1) and 
so arranged as to oppose the negative electrode (6) with 

a separator (5) sandwiched between them, and a nonaqueous 
electrolyte contained in the case (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithium
secondary battery and, more particularly, to a lithium
secondary battery in which the construction of a negative
electrode is improved.Recently, nonaqueous electrolyte batteries using
lithium as a negative electrode active material have
attracted attention as high-energy-density batteries.
Nonaqueous electrolyte primary batteries using, e.g.,
manganese dioxide (MnO2), carbon fluoride [(CF2)n], and
thionyl chloride (SO3Cl2) as a positive electrode active
material have already been used extensively as power
supplies of pocket calculators and watches and as backup
batteries of memories.In addition, with decreasing size and weight of
various electronic devices such as VTRs and communication
devices in recent years, demands have increasingly
arisen for high-energy-density secondary batteries for
use as power supplies of these devices. Therefore, the
study of lithium secondary batteries using lithium as a
negative electrode active material is being vigorously
done.More specifically, the study is being made on a
lithium secondary battery using a negative electrode
such as metal lithium; a nonaqueous electrolyte prepared
by dissolving a lithium salt, such as LiClO4, LiBF4, or
LiAsF6, in a nonaqueous solvent, such as 
propylenecarbonate (PC), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME),
γ-butylolactone (γ-BL), or tetrahydrofuran (THF), or an
electrolyte, such as a lithium ion conductive solid
electrolytic salt; and a positive electrode active
material, such as a compound which causes a topochemical
reaction with lithium, e.g., TiS2, MoS2, V2O5, V6O13,
and MnO2.However, no such lithium secondary batteries as
discussed above have been put into practical use. The
major reasons for this are a low charge/discharge efficiency
and a small number of times (a short cycle life)
by which charge/discharge is possible. This is considered
to be caused primarily by deterioration of
lithium brought about by the reaction between the metal
lithium of the negative electrode and the nonaqueous
electrolyte. That is, lithium which has dissolved as
lithium ions in a nonaqueous electrolyte during
discharge reacts with the nonaqueous solvent of the
electrolyte in precipitating on the surface of a lithium
negative electrode during charge. This makes a portion
of the surface of the negative electrode inert.
Therefore, if the charge/discharge is repeatedly performed,
lithium precipitates in a dendrite form or in
the form of small spheres on the negative electrode surface
and is eventually separated from the
