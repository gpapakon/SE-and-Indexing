<ABSTRACT>
A plasma etch process is described for the etching of oxide 
(30) with a high selectivity to nitride, including nitride 

(20) formed on uneven surfaces of a substrate (2), e.g., on 
sidewalls of steps (10, 12) on an integrated circuit 

structure. The addition of one or more hydrogen-containing 
gases, preferably one or more hydrofluorocarbon gases, to 

one or more fluorine-substituted hydrocarbon etch gases and 
a scavenger for fluorine, in a plasma etch process for 

etching oxide in preference to nitride, results in a high 
selectivity to nitride which is preserved regardless of the 

topography of the nitride portions (22, 26) of the 
substrate surface. In a preferred embodiment, one or more 

oxygen-bearing gases are also added to reduce the overall 
rate of polymer deposition on the chamber surfaces and on 

the surfaces to be etched, which can otherwise reduce the 
etch rate and cause excessive polymer deposition on the 

chamber surfaces. The fluorine scavenger is preferably an 
electrically grounded silicon electrode associated with the 

plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oxide etch process which is highly selective to nitride. 
More particularly, this invention relates to an oxide etch process with high selectivity 
to nitride which can be used on surfaces of uneven topology. A significant challenge in semiconductor fabrication is to etch an oxide such as a 
silicon oxide, in the presence of a nitride, such as a silicon nitride, without also 
etching the nitride, i.e., while maintaining a high selectivity to the nitride. An 
example of such could be where an oxide layer to be etched is located over a nitride 
layer. Since both oxide and nitride materials generally etch at the same rate in a 
typical fluorocarbon chemistry etch plasma commonly used for etching oxide, a 
process of providing additional selectivity must be found. When a fluorine-substituted hydrocarbon, such as C₃F₈, is used as an etchant, the 
fluorocarbon radicals react in the plasma to form a passivating coating of a carbon-fluorine 
polymer which forms over the materials being etched, e.g., by exposed oxide 
and nitride surfaces on a substrate. However, this polymer is dissociated by oxide 
atoms formed during the etch of the exposed oxide portions. Thus, as the oxide, 
e.g., silicon oxide, continues to etch, the nitride portions etches at a much slower rate 
due to the presence of the passivating coating thereon. However, the passivating  
 
layer is also attacked by free fluorine atoms present in the plasma, and thus the 
nitride also continues to be etched. Thus, a selectivity over about 8:1 of silicon 
nitride to silicon oxide was not achievable with such prior art etch processes due to 
the presence of such free fluorine atoms in the plasma. Since for state of the art 
devices having submicron dimensions, i.e., VSLI and ULSI devices, selectivity of 
over 10:1 and even 30:1 are required, an etch process for etching oxide in preference 
to nitride with a selectivity of over 10:1 would be highly desirable. In our parent application Serial No. 07/941,501, the subject matter of which is hereby 
incorporated by reference, we described and claimed the provision of a scavenger for 
fluorine such as a source of silicon or carbon. This scavenger for fluorine, when 
used in combination with such fluorine-substituted hydrocarbon etch gases, results in 
the formation of a carbon-rich polymer which does not dissociate over nitride 
surfaces, apparently due to either the reduced free fluorine content in the plasma, or 
the reduced fluorine content in the polymer, or both. In any
