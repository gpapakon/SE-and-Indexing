<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to unitary disposable absorbent 
articles, more particularly, catamenial pads or incontinent pads 
having elasticized side flaps. Unitary disposable absorbent articles such as catamenial pads 
or incontinent pads all have the same basic structure. An 
absorbent core is encased between a liquid pervious topsheet and a 
liquid impervious backsheet. Numerous variations of and elements 
in addition to the basic topsheet, backsheet, and absorbent core 
arrangements are known. Each additional element is usually 
directed to improving a specific characteristic of the catamenial 
pad or incontinent pad. Disposable absorbent articles have been provided with elastic 
members to improve the side leakage performance of such products. 
U.S. Patent 3,860,003, issued to Buell on January 14, 1975, 
discloses elasticized disposable absorbent articles wherein an 
elastic member is positioned in the side flap of the product 
between the topsheet and the backsheet. The elasticized portion 
of each side flap is positioned sufficiently remote from the 
semi-rigid absorbent body to permit an elasticized contractible  
 
line through the side flap. The side flap is gathered by the 
elastic member such that a boat-like configuration for the pad is 
presented and the side flaps form a barrier along the edges of the 
product. In particular, Figure 5 and Figure 6 show incontinent 
pads having various shaped absorbent cores wherein an elastic 
member is positioned along the side edges of the product. European Patent Application 0 091 412 A2, Widlund, published 
on October 12, 1983, adopts the configuration shown in the Buell 
'003 patent and specifically relates it to a feminine hygiene 
product. The Widlund application teaches a sanitary napkin with 
elastic means spaced from the core to thereby raise and form 
barriers against lateral leakage from the product. Figure 1 of 
the Widlund patent shows the boat-like shape of the product with 
the side flaps forming lateral barriers to the flow of exudates. U.S. Patent 4,597,761 issued to Buell on July 1, 1986, 
discloses an elasticized insert product for use as an incontinent 
pad or sanitary napkin having elastic in the side flaps. One or 
more elastic strands are positioned in the side flap to allow the 
product to assume the boat-like configuration shown in Figure 1 
with the side flaps extending upwardly to form barrier walls 
against lateral leakage. U.S. Patent 4,579,556 issued to McFarland on April 1, 1986, 
further defines the Buell '003 concept for
