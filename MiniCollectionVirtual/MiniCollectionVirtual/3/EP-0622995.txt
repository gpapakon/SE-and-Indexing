<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chair and its
support, and more particularly, to a chair and support
designed to provide in use a degree of controlled "yield"
for the particular purposes described below.Studies in the field of ergonomics have shown
that by encouraging subtle and unconscious use of muscle
groups ordinarily at rest, the body may be energized in a
way which manifests itself in longer, more comfortable and
more efficient work spans. In one of its aspects, the
present invention provides a resilient seat support,
exploiting elastomeric and other spring elements as well
as the flexibility and resilience of other parts of the
chair, to provide a controlled yield in the fore and aft,
as well as lateral and oblique directions. In other
words, when the occupant of a chair in accordance with the
invention chooses to lean to the rear, a tilting action,
conventional in many chairs, takes place. If the occupant
also leans slightly to the left or to the right, or if the
occupant while sitting upright reaches to the left or
right, the chair shifts slightly to a limited and
desirable extent, following the body and inducing the
occupant to use a series of different muscle groups to
counteract the tilt.It has been suggested that these desired body
movements be facilitated by the design of a chair. See,
for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,500,137, issued February
19, 1985, to Laurence E. Morehouse. The chair shown in
that patent, by its shape, seeks to motivate and
accommodate motion by the occupant. The present invention
likewise seeks to accommodate beneficial motion, but uses
a dufferent approach. A chair with a support according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-3
369 840. The invention is thus defined by claim 1 with reference to the
characterising part thereof.With the above in mind, there is herein disclosed, a chair, preferably with a
unitary seat element having a seat base and a seat back, a support pedestal provided
with casters and a pneumatic or hydraulic support cylinder, and a cantilever support arm
extending between the pedestal and the seat element to support the seat element. An
ergonomic seat support is provided between the cantilever arm and the seat element,
and accommodates and facilitates controlled movement between them. In one presently
preferred form of the invention, the support arm engages and supports a bracket
member, disposed transversely beneath a forward portion of the seat base, and the
bracket member receives and supports in turn a transversely disposed support bar.

(22) between said pedestal and said seat element (12), for supporting said chair (10);

wherein the first support bar (58) of the resilient support is coupled to said support arm
(22) and extends longitudinally with respect to said seat base (16), the distal end portion

of the first support bar (58) operatively engaging said bottom wall (18) of said seat base
(16) to resiliently support said seat element (12); and the second support bar (30) being

resiliently coupled to said support arm (22) extending transversely with respect to said
