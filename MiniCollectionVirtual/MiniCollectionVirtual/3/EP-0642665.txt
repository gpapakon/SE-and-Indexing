<ABSTRACT>
A method of improving the specific binding reactivity of a polypeptide which is capable of polypeptide complexing is disclosed. The method involves contacting the polypeptide with an anionic surfactant capable of decomplexing the polypeptide under suitable conditions resulting in at least some decomplexing of the polypeptide. The polypeptide is then contacted with a nonionic surfactant capable of complexing with the anionic surfactant under suitable conditions resulting in at least some of the decomplexed polypeptide remaining decomplexed. A method of assay of a sample containing a polypeptide which is capable of polypeptide complexing is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND ASSAY INVOLVING IMPROVED SPECIFIC BINDING REACTIVITY OF A POLYPEPTIDEThis is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/037,596, filed March 26, 1993, now abandoned.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method of improving the specific binding reactivity of a polypeptide in a sample, and specific binding assays incorporating that method.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many polypeptides are present in biological fluids and assay samples in a form in which a specific binding site or sites are inaccessible to binding partners specific to those binding sites. The inaccessibility of the binding sites is due to such phenomena as noncovalent binding between the polypeptide of interest and molecules with which it is complexed in precursor or latent form, or between the polypeptide of interest and other molecules in the sample. The noncovalently bound molecule or molecules block specific binding sites on the polypeptide of interest. The molecules with which the polypeptide of interest is complexed in the biological fluid or sample include other polypeptides, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and lipoproteins. Some complexed polypeptides are formed in the fluid or sample, such as blood or serum, while other complexed polypeptides are secreted in complexed form from cells such as platelets. The noncovalent binding in these polypeptide complexes is very strong, and is usually reversible only by proteolytic digestion. This noncovalent binding hampers efforts to design specific binding assays that exploit the highly specific reaction between a specific binding site and its specific binding partner. Specific binding assays that target polypeptides which are present at least partially in complexed form are unreliable and produce inconsistent results due to the interference of the noncovalently bound polypeptide, proteoglycan, glycoprotein or lipoprotein with a specific binding site for a specific binding partner.Illustrative of this problem is the assaying of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). Transforming growth factor β is a ubiquitous molecule 

which regulates growth and differentiation in many cell types. TGFβ was first described as a factor which caused phenotypic transformation of rat fibroblasts, but is now known as a multifunctional regulator of cellular growth and differentiation; it is a potent growth inhibitor for many cells, such as epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells, and T and B lymphocytes, but induces proliferation in other cell types, primarily cells
