<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a web-fed rotary offset printing machine having a plurality of printing units arranged successively and a printing unit for the flying plate change, in which a plate cylinder/transfer cylinder pair are shut down for the plate exchange and the other pair can be engaged against a common rotating back pressure cylinder. Two gear wheels are positioned on at least one of the cylinder axles of the printing unit for the flying plate change. During printing operation, the drive in each case of one plate cylinder/transfer cylinder pair can be disconnected from the main drive supplied via the back pressure cylinder and can be connected to an auxiliary drive. The invention is characterised in that the printing unit cylinders (11, 12, 13, 15, 16) are in an essentially vertically extending installation position, and both the printing unit cylinders (12, 13) of an upper printing unit (14) and the printing unit cylinders (15, 16) of a lower printing unit (17) can be disengaged together in each case from the back pressure cylinder (11).

Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing-forme change, in 
which one pair of printing-forme transfer cylinders can 

be stopped at a printing-forme change and the other 
thrown on a common rotating counterpressure cylinder, two 

gearwheels are positioned on at least one of the 
printing-assembly cylinder shafts of the printing 

assembly for a flying printing-forme change, and, in the 
imprint mode, the drive of a respective pair of printing-forme 

cylinder transfer cylinders can be uncoupled from 
the main drive supplied via the counterpressure cylinder 

and can be connected via couplings to an auxiliary drive, 
characterized in that the printing-assembly cylinders 

(11, 12, 13, 15, 16) of the printing assembly for a 
flying printing-forme change, including the joint 

counterpressure cylinder (11), are located in an essentially 
vertically extended installation position, and 

both the printing-assembly cylinders (12, 13) of an upper 
printing unit (14) and the printing-assembly cylinders 

(15, 16) of a lower printing unit (17) can respectively 
be thrown off jointly from the counterpressure cylinder 

(11). 
Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing- forme change 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the printing-assembly 

cylinders (12, 13) of the upper printing unit 
(14) and the printing-assembly cylinders (15, 16) of the  

 
lower printing unit (17) are respectively arranged 

symmetrically relative to the counterpressure cylinder 
(11). 
Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing-forme change 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the printing-assembly 

cylinders (12, 13) of the upper printing unit 
(14) and the printing-assembly cylinders (15 and 16) of 

the lower printing unit (17) are assigned in each case a 
multiple-disc clutch (18, 19) and in each case a denture 

clutch (29, 30). 
Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing-forme change 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the upper 

printing unit (14) and the lower printing unit (17) are 
each provided with a rotation transmitter (38). 
Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing-forme change 
according to Claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the 

rotation transmitter (38) of the respective printing unit 
(14, 17) is mounted on the shaft of the printing-assembly 

cylinder (12, 13; 15, 16) which also receives the respective 
denture clutch (29, 30) of the respective printing 

unit (14, 17). 
Web-fed rotary printing machine with a plurality 
of successively arranged printing assemblies and with a 

printing assembly for a flying printing-forme change 
according to Claim 3, characterized in that the denture 

clutch (29, 30) assigned to the respective printing unit 
(14, 17) is mounted separately.
