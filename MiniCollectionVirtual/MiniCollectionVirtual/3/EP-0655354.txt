<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire for small passenger vehicles having a 
pair of bead portions located at the internal periphery 

of a pair of sidewalls connected to a tread at both its 
edges, characterized in that the bead core (1) of the 

bead portion is a mono strand bead core, and the section 
of the bead core is a close-packed structure unit made of 

3 to 20 wires (2); the diameter (D) of the wires is 1.2 
to 1.8 mm, and the ratio (H/D) of the distance (H) 

between the centers of adjacent wires to the diameter (D) 
of the wires is 1.01 to 1.20; and the sectional 

configuration of the bead core is such that 

N(2) = N(1) + 1 
 
, 

where N(1) is the wire number of the first row and 
N(2) is the wire number of the second row counted from 

the bead base side. 
It is possible to improve steering characteristics 
(manoeuvrability) of such a pneumatic tire for small 

passenger vehicles by restraining the disorder of 
uniformity of the tire in the circumferential and 

longitudinal directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pneumatic tires, and in 
particular to pneumatic tires for small passenger 
vehicles having good steering characteristics by 
improving the bead construction of the tire. The bead core of the bead portion of a pneumatic tire 
has a function of locating and fixing textile or steel 
cords of a carcass ply and a function of determining the 
internal periphery of the tire body and engaging the 
tire with a wheel rim. Thus, the bead core is a very important component part 
in a pneumatic tire, and various kinds of constructions 
of bead core have been proposed. For example, as shown 
in Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings, it is well 
known to construct a bead core 10 by winding a strip 11 
of wire-rubber matrix made of one row of several wires 
12 buried in rubber 13. The sectional configuration of 
such a bead core is shown in Figure 6. However, in manufacturing a pneumatic tire having the 
above-mentioned bead core obtained by winding a strip of 
wire-rubber matrix or other conventional bead core, the 
rows and lines of the wire-rubber matrix tend to fall 
into disorder during tire building and curing, and it is 
very difficult to maintain uniformity of tires in  
 
circumferential and longitudinal directions. 
Consequently, the steering characteristics 
(manoeuvrability) of the tires thus manufactured are 
adversely affected. A prior art tire disclosing the features of the preamble of 
claim 1 is shown e.g. by US-A-5 010 938. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
pneumatic tire for small passenger vehicles having 
improved steering characteristics (manoeuvrability) by 
restraining the disorder of uniformity of tires in the 
circumferential and longitudinal directions. The present invention provides a pneumatic tire, 
particularly for small passenger vehicles, having a pair 
of bead portions located at the internal periphery of a 
pair of sidewalls connected to a tread at both edges 
thereof, 
the bead core of the bead portion being a mono strand 
bead core made of rubberized circular-section wires 
spirally wound and bundled, characterized in that: 
(a) the section of the bead 
core is a close-packed structure unit made of 3 to 20 
wires; (b) the diameter (D) of the wires is 1.2 to 2.2 mm, and 
the ratio (H/D) of the distance (H) between the centers 
of adjacent wires to the diameter (D) of the wires is 
1.01 to 1.20; and (c) the sectional configuration of the bead core is such 
that N(2) = N(1) + 1, where N(1) is the wire number of 
the first row and
