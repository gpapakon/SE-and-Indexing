<ABSTRACT>
An electrically powered tool (10), in particular an 
electrically powered tool of the type which comprises a 

shaft assembly (14) of adjustable length, comprises: 

(a) a handle assembly (16); 
(b) a cable entry (38) mounted in the handle 
assembly (16); 
(c) a shaft assembly (14), one end of which is mounted in 
the handle assembly (16); 
(d) a head (12) mounted at the end of the shaft assembly (14) 
remote from the handle assembly (16); 
(e) an electric motor (20) mounted within the head (12), and 
(f) a cable (30) which extends within the shaft assembly (14) 
from the cable entry (38) to the motor (20). 
The shaft assembly (14) is adjustable to allow relative 
movement between the head (12) and the handle assembly (16) in the 

radial and/or the axial direction, and the cable (30) follows a 
path within the shaft assembly (14) which path is defined and 

which is variable depending on the extent of extension 
and/or rotation of the head relative to the handle assembly (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically 
powered tool, in particular an electrically powered tool of 
the type which comprises a shaft assembly of adjustable 
length, located between a handle assembly providing an entry 
for cable supplying electrical power and an electric motor 
mounted in a housing at the opposite end of the shaft 
assembly, and in which a cable for supplying electrical 
power extends along the inside of the shaft assembly from 
the cable entry to the electric motor. Electrically powered tools of this type include 
vegetation cutters, in particular vegetation cutters which 
cut by means of a filament or strip that is rotated rapidly 
about an axis that may be either substantially vertical or 
substantially horizontal, depending upon the application. In vegetation cutters of this type, radial adjustment 
is provided in particular so that the unit can be used for 
trimming, in which the cutting filament or strip is rotated 
about a substantially vertical axis and edging, in which the 
cutting filament or strip is rotated about a substantially 
horizontal axis. Axial, or length, adjustment is provided 
so that the tool can be adjusted to the optimum length for 
an individual operator, for either edging or trimming. It is known to provide electrically powered tools of 
this type in which the cable for supplying electrical power 
is of the coiled or spirally wound type, which allows for 
extension and reduction of the length of the cable as the 
length of the shaft assembly is adjusted. Such cable has 
the disadvantage that it is expensive, and can lead both to 
difficulties during assembly of the tool, especially in  
 
automated assembly procedures and to over heating if the 
tool is used for a prolonged period in the non-extended 
position. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
electrically powered tool in which the above disadvantages 
are reduced or substantially obviated. The present invention provides an electrically powered 
tool comprising a handle assembly, a cable entry mounted in 
the handle assembly, a shaft assembly, one end of which is 
mounted in the handle assembly, a head mounted at the end of 
the shaft assembly remote from the handle assembly, an 
electric motor mounted within the head, and a cable which 
extends within the shaft assembly from the cable entry to 
the motor, characterised in that the shaft assembly is 
adjustable to allow relative movement between the head and 
the handle assembly in the radial and/or the axial 
direction, and

1 An electrically powered tool (10) comprising 

(a) a handle assembly (16), 
(b) a cable entry (38) mounted in the handle 
assembly (16), 
(c) a shaft assembly (14), one end of which is mounted 
in the handle assembly (16), 
(d) a head (12) mounted at the end of the shaft 
assembly (14) remote from the handle assembly (16), 
(e) an electric motor (20) mounted within the head 
(12), and 
(f) a cable (30), (32) which extends within the shaft 
assembly from the cable entry (38) to the motor (20), 

   characterised in that 
   the shaft assembly (14) is adjustable to allow relative 

movement between the head (12) and the handle assembly (16) 
in the radial and/or the axial direction, 

   and the cable (30) follows a path within the shaft 
assembly (14) which path is defined and which is variable 

depending on the extent of extension and/or rotation of the 
head (12) relative to the handle assembly (16). 
2 An electrically powered tool according to claim 1 
characterised in that the shaft assembly (14) is of 

clamshell construction, and comprises a first shaft part 
(26) on which the head (12) is mounted and a second shaft 

part (28) on which the handle assembly (16) is mounted. 
3 An electrically powered tool according to claim 1 
characterised in that a bell mouth exit (50) is provided at 

the end of the first shaft part (26), and the cable (30) 
passes through the exit (50). 
4 An electrically powered tool according to claim 3 
characterised in that the cable (30) passes around a fixed 

post (52) in the second shaft part (28), the fixed post (52) 
being positioned so that when the tool is assembled and in 

the closed position, the linear distance between the fixed 
post (52) and the bell mouth exit (50) is at least half the 

maximum amount by which the tool can be extended. 
5 An electrically operated tool according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the fixed post (52) is one of the 

screw bosses used to secure the mating parts of the 
clamshell.
