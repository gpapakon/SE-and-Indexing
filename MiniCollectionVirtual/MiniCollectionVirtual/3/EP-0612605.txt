Blow moulding machine for producing multi-axis hollow 
bodies of a plastics material, e.g. tube pieces which are 

curved once or several times, with a blow head (1), which 
produces a hose capable of being plastically formed under 

heat and is disposed after an extruder, and a split blow 
mould, which is mounted in a rising table and has a mould 

cavity (12) into which a cut-to-length hose piece (3) is 
introduced as a parison (10), which piece is blown into a 

hollow body (16) following the closure of the blow mould, 
characterised in that a premould (4), which can move between 

the blow head (1) and the blowing station comprising a blow 
mould (11, 15) with a horizontal parting plane and the shape 

of which is adapted to that of the mould cavity (12) of the 
blow mould, is provided with a mould trough (5) which is 

open on the blow head side, can be displaced at least in its 
hose receiving position below the blow head (1) in two 

horizontal directions (X and Y axis) and can be moved into a 
position above the mould cavity (12) of the bottom mould 

part (11) to release the parison (10). 
Blow moulding machine according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the premould (4) can be raised and lowered in the 

vertical direction in its hose receiving position. 
Blow moulding machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the premould (4) is mounted on a frame 

(7) of lightweight construction. 
Blow mould according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the bottom of the premould (4) 

consists of at least one pivotable bottom flap (6, 6a). 
Blow moulding machine according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the bottom of the premould (4) is composed of flap 

segments (6-6a, 6'-6a', 6''-6a''...6
n
-6a
n
) in conformity with 
the curved trend of the mould trough (5).  

 
Blow moulding machine according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the bottom flaps are in the form of rails, pins, 

etc. which are arranged like a rake and which in the closed 
state, being staggered, intermesh. 
Blow moulding machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the bottom of the premould (4) 

consists of one or more metal plate(s) which can be 
displaced laterally along the X axis. 
Method for producing hollow bodies such as tube pieces 
which are curved once or several times, comprising the 

following steps: 

a) an extruder head discharges a hose which can be 
plastically formed under heat, 
b) a parison transport device is moved in two horizontal 
directions (X and Y axis) below the extruder head and 

receives the hose in its mould trough, 
c) the parison transport device is moved into a position 
above the mould cavity of a blow mould such that the mould 

trough is positioned with the hose disposed thereon 
vertically above the mould cavity, 
d) the bottom of the mould trough is opened so that the hose 
falls into the mould cavity, 
e) the blow mould is closed and the hose is forced against 
the wall of the mould cavity by introducing a blow medium. 
Method according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
parison transport device is raised and lowered in the 

vertical direction (Z axis) below the extruder head.
