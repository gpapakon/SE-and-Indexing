<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a polyester-modified 
silicone resin which comprises mixing an alkoxysilane and/or its 

hydrolyzate, i.e. an alkoxysiloxane, and a polyester resin having at least two 
hydroxyl groups in the molecule, and subjecting the mixture to hydrolysis 

and polycondensation reactions in the presence of an acid catalyst. This 
process is performed by a continuous one-stage reaction sequence includ
ing 
hydrolysis, polycondensation and modification and is simplified. A 

composition comprising the polyester-modified silicone resin is curable at 
low temperatures to provide a cured film having good physical properties. 

The composition further comprising organozinc compounds is significantly 
improved in heat resistance and color difference.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a polyester-modified
silicone resin by a simple preparation procedure. The invention also relates to
a curable silicone resin composition which comprises a polyester-modified
silicone resin of the type mentioned above and also to a cured product obtained
therefrom.As is known in the art, polyester-modified silicone resins have good
weatherability and heat resistance and also have such good characteristics as
to suffer only a reduced degree of discoloration through thermal degradation on
comparison with those of other types of modified silicone varnishes. Thus, the
polyester-modified silicone resins have wide utility in the fields of paints or
varnishes for buildings, automobiles, mufflers for transport planes, cooking
utensils.In usual practice, polyester-modified silicone resins have been prepared by
initially preparing polyester resins from saturated polybasic acids and
polyhydric alcohols, and then preparing silicone resins by hydrolysis and
condensation of chlorosilane or alkoxysilanes as having a molecular weight of
about 1,000. Subsequently, such silicone resins are subjected to dehydration or
de-alcoholization condensation reaction with the polyester resins in the 
presence of a metallic catalyst, such as a titanium catalyst, thereby obtaining
the modified silicone resins.However, the above process broadly comprises the three steps including
the step of preparing a polyester resin, the step of preparing a silicone resin,
and the step of the modification. Thus, the process is complicated in its
procedure.Moreover, the resultant polyester-modified silicone resins have to be cured
under high temperature and long-term heating conditions or by use of curing
catalysts, such as a lead catalyst, in order to obtain a cured film having
optimum hardness and wear resistance. The high temperature and long-term
heating conditions require high costs, and the use of the lead catalyst presents
a problem on safety.The cured film obtained from polyester-modified silicone resins may suffer
yellowing owing to its low heat resistance. To avoid this, it is known to add zinc
compounds to the silicone resins, by which the heat resistance and yellowing
deficiency can be improved to an extent (Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 5-255638). However, the zinc compounds have no catalytic
action on the curing reaction. For polyester-modified silicone resins prepared
according to known processes, it is essential to use curing catalysts such as of
lead in order to obtain
