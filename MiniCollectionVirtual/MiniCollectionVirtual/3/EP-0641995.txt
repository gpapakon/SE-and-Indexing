<ABSTRACT>
A surveying instrument (20) includes an optical 
sighting scope having a sighting barrel (26) and 

orthogonal reticular lines (34a,34b) visible to an 
observer viewing through the barrel, in combination with 

a miniature light plane generator (24) that is oriented 
to produce a plane of light (51,52) that is coincident 

with one of the reticular lines in the direction viewed 
by an observer viewing through the barrel. The miniature 

light plane generator includes a laser diode (42) that 
generates a beam of light, a collimating lens (46) 

positioned within the beam of light generated by the 
laser diode in order to produce a beam of collimated 

light, and a fan lens (50) positioned within the beam of 
collimated light in order to divert the beam of light 

into a plane. The miniature generator additionally 
includes a power supply that supplies power selectively 

at a low duty cycle or a high duty cycle. The resulting 
reduction in electrical power required by the generator 

in the low duty cycle mode allows the components making 
up the generator, including a battery (54) for supplying 

energy to the power supply, to be combined within the 
housing of the optical sighting scope in order to provide 

a compact instrument. The visible light plane in the 
high duty cycle mode allows the instrument to be used in 

medium ambient light conditions without a separate 
sensor. This allows use with a self-leveling optical 

device (61,64") to concurrently level the image viewed by 
the user and the light plane generated by the miniature 

generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a surveying 
instrument, or apparatus, and more particularly to a 
surveying instrument providing both an optical sighting 
scope and planar referencing device that generates a 
datum plane of light for surveying tasks. The use of a conventional transit to perform a 
surveying task, such as locating footer forms 10a,10b can 
be illustrated by reference to Figure 1 of the 
accompanying drawings. A first operator 11 observes the 
image of stakes 14, or the like, being moved about by a 
remote worker 13a, while the first operator uses arm and 
hand or voice signals to communicate movement to the 
remote worker (Fig. 1). Once the line is established in 
this manner, height or elevation may be established by 
using a measuring stick 16, which is raised or lowered by 
the remote worker 13b in response to communications from 
the first operator, until the desired elevation is 
reached. While such conventional technique is suitable when 
two or more workers are available and under fairly 
controlled site conditions, the effort required increases 
enormously if the same individual must make the 
observation and adjust the implement observed, especially 
when the site is overgrown or otherwise presents 
difficult terrain. In order to allow an individual 
operator to perform a surveying task, devices have been 
developed that generate a datum plane of light, which may 
be set up at a particular vertical or horizontal plane 
and used by the same operator, holding a remote light 
sensor, to establish required headings and elevations. Prior art datum plane light generators have not met  
 
their full potential because they have been too expensive 
and require bulky power supplies in order to power the 
gas laser and rotating motor typically used in such 
devices to generate a light plane. Accordingly, such 
devices have been relegated to fairly specialized 
applications and have not found general use. According to the present invention, a surveying 
apparatus for use by an observer comprises a surveying 
apparatus for use by an observer, comprising an optical 
sighting scope including a barrel and means defining 
orthogonal reticular lines visible to an observer viewing 
through said barrel, and is characterised by at least one 
light generator adapted to project a datum plane of light 
to coincide with one of said reticular lines in the 
direction viewed by an observer viewing through said 
barrel. It is thus possible to construct a surveying 
instrument that includes a miniature
