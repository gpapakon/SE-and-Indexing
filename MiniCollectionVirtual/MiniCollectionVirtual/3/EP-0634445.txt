<ABSTRACT>
A light diffuser composition contains 

a) from 0.1 to 30 weight parts of inorganic particles 
having an average particle diameter of from 0.1 to 1 

micrometer and a refractive index of from 1.9 to 3.2 and 
b) from 1 to 150 weight parts of polymeric particles 
having a core/shell morphology with a core of a rubbery 

vinyl polymer and one or more shells, which particles 
contain at least 15% of a polymerized alkyl acrylate or 

alkyl methacrylate, based on the total weight of the 
particles. 
The light diffuser composition is useful for 
preparing a polymer composition which contains a 

thermoplastic polymer and 

a) from 0.001 to 0.3% of the inorganic particles a) and 
b) from 0.01 to 1.5% of the polymeric particles b). 
Molded articles can be produced from the 
polymer composition which are particularly useful in 

lighting applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light
diffuser composition and its use for imparting light
diffusing properties to a thermoplastic polymer. The
present invention further relates to a polymer
composition containing the novel light diffuser
composition and to a compounded composition or molded
article produced therefrom.It is well known to incorporate light diffusers
into thermoplastic, transparent polymers. The light
diffusers are generally white. When light diffusers are
incorporated into a thermoplastic polymer, the polymer
composition and articles produced therefrom have light
diffusing properties. Usually the resulting colors of
these composites are called opalescent colors. They are
semi-transparent or translucent to visible light, that
is, they scatter transmitted light so that the light
source is not visible. Light diffusing polymer
compositions may be formed into sheets or films of
various thicknesses, or into more complex shapes, such
as lamp covers like globes etc. Light diffusing polymer
compositions are widely used by the lighting industry
for producing luminaires, like fixed luminaires, road
and street lighting, emergency lighting, etc.
Accordingly, one important property of light diffusing
polymer compositions and articles produced therefrom is
a high resistance to thermal aging, particularly a high
color stability when exposed to elevated temperatures
over an extended time period. It is known to incorporate certain inorganic
additives into polymer compositions in order to impart
to the compositions light-diffusing properties.British patent specification 1,595,426 disclose
plastics containing a translucent organic polymer and a
white pigment which appear white in reflected and
transmitted light. The refractive index no of the
polymer is in the range of from 1.4 to 1.65 and the
refractive index n of the pigment is in the range of
from 1.7 to 2.9. Exemplary of white pigments are for
example titanium phosphate, lead hydrogen phosphate,
zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, magnesium titanate, calcium
titanate, titanium dioxide, etc.German patent 22 51 708 teaches it to be known
that white pigments, such as titanium dioxide, zinc
sulfide or zinc oxide provide articles produced from
organic polymers with an milky white color. The German
patent teaches that such pigmented articles have such a
low light transmittance that they are not useful as lamp
covers. If only a small amount of such pigments is
used, they do not scatter the light. German patent
2 251 708 teaches that barium sulfate which has
isometrica
