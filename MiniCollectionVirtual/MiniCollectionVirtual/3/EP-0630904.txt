<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel and an 
optically active nicotine derivative, and particularly 
to a nicotine derivatives containing a glycosyl group 
represented by the following formula (1). 
   Wherein R represents a hexose or a dihexose. 
Further, 
is an (S)-(-)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-2-pyridyl 
group, an (R)-(+)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-2-pyridyl 
group, an (S)-(-)-5-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-2-pyridyl 
group, or an
 
(R)-(+)-5-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-2-pyridyl group. Nicotine is an alkaloid obtained as a by-product in 
the tobacco industry. A useful derivative of nicotine is 
also known to have an effect of improving the flavor and 
taste of tobacco (for Example, Jpn. Pat. Nos. 1371806  
 
and 1456909). As a physiological activity of nicotine, for 
example, an autonomic nervous regulatory activity, a 
circulatory-system regulatory activity such as 
vasopressor activity, or a digestive organ regulatory 
activity such as gastrointestinal activation (for 
example, Seikagaku, 57, 447 (1985), J. Pharm. Experi. 
Ther., 222, 463 (1983), Br. J. Pharmac., 79, 869 (1983)) 
are known. Further, alkoxy nicotine is known to have an 
antimicrobial activity and an antibacterial activity 
(U.S. Patent Serial No. 3,644,176). As mentioned above, 
nicotine and a nicotine derivative have a variety of 
physiological activities, and they are expected to be 
useful as a pharmaceutical agent. In addition, a 
sulfate of nicotine is used as an agricultural 
insecticide, and application of nicotine or nicotine 
derivative to the agricultural field is also 
expected. However, since nicotine has toxicity by itself and 
its volatility is high, application of nicotine to the 
above-mentioned individual fields or practical use of 
nicotine in those fields has not yet been achieved. 
Accordingly, there is a demand for a nicotine derivative 
having its useful properties and capable of solving a 
problem such as toxicity. The present invention has been made under the 
above-mentioned circumstances and has an object to 
provide a novel nicotine derivative which is useful as 
an agent for improving the flavor and taste of tobacco, 
which can be expected to be used as a physiologically 
active substance. The object of the present invention can be achieved 
by a novel nicotine derivative represented by the 
following formula (1)     wherein R and a group represented by 
   are the same as defined above. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be 
explained in detail. The novel nicotine derivative of the present
