<ABSTRACT>
Continuous process for the isomerisation of n-olefins containing at most 20 carbon atoms, in the presence of a catalyst, in which a charge containing the said n-olefins is made to move through at least one mobile bed reaction region, the catalyst flowing into each reaction region. The catalyst drawn off from the last reaction region is conveyed into a regeneration region and is reintroduced, at the exit of the latter, close to the first reaction region. According to the process, the catalyst drawn off from the last reaction region is conveyed, after regeneration, into a region where it is subjected to a steam treatment before reintroduction into the first reaction region. The process is implemented in the presence of steam.

Process for the skeletal isomerization of n-olefins containing 
at the most 20 carbon atoms, in which the charge containing the 

n-olefins is, in a reaction zone, contacted with an alumina-based 
catalyst in the presence of water and the spent catalyst is regenerated 

and then treated with steam before being recontacted with the 
charge, the temperature in the reaction zone being between 300 and 

600°C, the pressure between 1 and 10 bars, the space velocity of the 
charge between 0.1 and 10 h⁻¹, characterized in that the continuous 

process takes place with a flow of the catalyst essentially constituted 
by alumina and 0.03 to 0.6 wt. % of titanium, the catalyst 

passing through the moving bed reaction zone being drawn off for 
regeneration and then treatment with steam at a temperature substantially 

equal to that of the reaction zone and the steam quantity in 
contact with the catalyst, in the reaction zone and during the treatment 

after regeneration is at between 3 and 85 wt.% based on the 
catalyst weight, the quantity of water introduced into the reaction
