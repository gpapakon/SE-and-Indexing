<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement having a MOS power transistor, it is provided, for the purpose of driving the said transistor, that the drain connection (A) of the transistor (M1) can be connected to the gate connection of the transistor via a charge pump (LP) and that the transistor and the charge pump have a common reference potential. This makes possible a switching stage which is normally on and operates with small operating voltages. In a preferred embodiment, it is provided that a control loop (RS) is arranged between the output of the charge pump (LP) and the gate of the transistor, for controlling the voltage across the drain connection (A) of the transistor to a constant value. Undesired control oscillations (hunting) in the load circuit of the MOS transistor can thus be corrected.
