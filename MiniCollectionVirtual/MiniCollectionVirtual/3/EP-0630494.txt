<ABSTRACT>
A control system, more especially for use in a glassware forming machine, to control movement of a driven member (12), for example carrying molten glass, between first and second rest positions, wherein the member is driven via a pneumatic valve (16) which receives control signals from a signal processing system (32) which continually receives feedback representing the position of the driven member, and responsibly thereto the control signals are produced in accordance with a repetitive algorithm determining a motion profile controlling both velocity and acceleration in such a manner that the driven member is brought to rest exactly at the required position without exceeding limiting values for acceleration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system suitable for use in a glassware forming machine, 
and in particular to a control system for controlling the 
movement of a moveable member in such a machine. In a common type of glassware forming machine, a gob of molten glass is formed, at a 
blank station, into a parison, the parison is transferred to a blow station at which it is 
blown into a container, and the blown container is then removed from the machine to a 
cooling station and thence to a conveyor. The parison when it is transferred from the blank station to the blow station, and the 
blown container when it is moved from the blow station to the cooling station, are at 
comparatively high temperatures, and the glass of which they are formed is readily 
deformable. Consequently, movement of the parison and the blown container has to be 
very carefully controlled to avoid distortion or damage, while at the same time such 
movement needs to be carried out as quickly as possible to obtain the maximum output 
from the machine. In the case of movement of the parison from the blank station to the blow station, this is 
usually performed by an invert mechanism which carries the parisons of hot glass from 
the blank station through about 180Â° about a horizontal axis, to the blow station. In the 
case of movement of the blown container from the blow station to the cooling station, this 
is usually performed by a take-out mechanism, which picks the blown containers up from 
the blow station and moves them, in a vertical orientation, through an arcuate path to the 
cooling station.  
 Critical control of the movement of the take-out mechanism and of the invert mechanism 
during their operation to move the glass is necessary in order to avoid distortion of the 
still soft glass and damage due to any sudden uncontrolled motion. There are certain other mechanisms in a glassware forming machine where, for other 
reasons, critical control of the movement of a mechanical member is desirable. An 
example of this is the movement of the plunger in a parison forming operation, which 
needs to be closely controlled to avoid the development of excessive pressure on the glass. 
Other mechanisms will benefit from critical control of their movement, in that faster and 
more precise operation and a longer life can thus be obtained. From US-A-4599101 there is known a type of control system (hereinafter "a control 
system of the type described") for controlling the movement of a driven member arranged 
to be driven between first
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A control system for controlling the movement of a driven member (10) arranged to 
be driven between first and second positions by a pneumatic piston and cylinder device 

(14), comprising a solenoid driven proportional pneumatic valve (16) adapted to control 
the supply of air to the piston and cylinder device (14), a transducer (26) which senses the 

position of the driven member, and an electronic signal processing system (32,34) 
incorporating a memory in which a desired motion profile is stored, which processing 

system throughout each cycle receives as a feedback from the transducer (26) the position 
of the driven member (10), characterised in that the processing system produces control 

signals for the valve (16) in accordance with a repetitive algorithm which takes account 
not only of the position error of the driven member from the motion profile but also of 

the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of the driven member, so that the valve (16) 
supplies air to the piston and cylinder device (14) to cause the member to move from rest 

at the first position to rest at the second position in a manner determined by the motion 
profile with the velocity and acceleration of the driven member being controlled so that 

the member moves from rest at its first position to rest at its second position without 
exceeding permitted maximum values of acceleration.
