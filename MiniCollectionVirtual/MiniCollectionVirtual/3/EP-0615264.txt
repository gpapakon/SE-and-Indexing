<ABSTRACT>
In the case of this push-button switch, a closure ring (2) enters a covering plate (1). A push button (4) which enters the closure (2) from the rear side is provided with a lens cap (3). Plungers (5) of the push button (4) pass through an existing adapter (6) and operate a switch which is supported by a switch block (7). A light reflector (10), which consists of a foot (8) and a reflector part (9), is inserted into an opening (11) in the adapter (6). A printed circuit (13) having light-emitting diodes (LED1 ... LED5) and diodes (D1 ... D4) enters the foot (8) of the light reflector (10) from the rear side. The supply voltage of the diode circuit is supplied to the printed circuit (13) by means of connecting wires (L1; L2).

Push button switch, with light-emitting semiconductors (LED1...LED5) 
as light source, for lifts, wherein the light of the light-emitting 

semiconductors (LED1...LED5), which are arranged on a printed circuit 
(13), is guided as acknowledgement to a light-permeable push button (4), 

and a light reflector (10), which is carried by an adapter (6), is 
provided for the light guidance, characterised thereby that the adapter 

(6) is connected with a stationary switch block (7), wherein plungers 
(5) of the push button (4) Denetrate the adapter (6) and actuate a 

switch arranged at the switch block (7), that the light reflector (10) 
comprises a reflector part (9) and a foot (8), which mutually form an 

outer shoulder (12) by which the light reflector (10) bears against the 
adapter (6) and that the light reflector (10) has at the foot (8) an 

inner shoulder (14) against which the printed circuit (13) with the 
light-emitting semiconductors (LED1...LED5) bears. 
Press button switch according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the light reflector (10) has bores (B1...B5), which reach from the foot 

(8) to the reflector part (9) and are penetrated by the light-emitting 
semiconductors (LED1...LED5). 
Press button switch according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
thereby that t
he light reflector (10) has a cylindrical shape. 
Press button switch according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
thereby that the light reflector (10) has a cube shape. 
Press button switch according to the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby that the light-emitting semiconductors (LED1...LED5) lie in a 

series circuit at one bridge branch of a bridge rectifier formed by 
diodes (D1...D4) and the other bridge branch is acted on by the supply 

voltage.  
 
Press button switch according to claim 5, characterised thereby that 
light-emitting semiconductors (LED1...LED5) are provided, which transmit 

light at the wavelength of 590 nm. 
Press button switch according to claim 5, characterised thereby that 
light-emitting semiconductors (LED1...LED5) are provided, which transmit 

light deviating from the wavelength of 590 nm.
