<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 99.5+ wt.% para-xylene by selective alkylation comprises providing an intermediate product having 99.0 to 99.8 wt.% purity and reacting it with an alkylating agent. The agent preferably has at least one tertiary butyl moiety and is reacted in the presence of an acidic catalyst under conditions where the catalyst is in good molecular contact with the non-para-xylene isomers. The catalyst may be a high surface area acidic heterogeneous catalyst such as a proton-exchanged zeolite. Upon distillation, para-xylene is recovered in 99.5 wt.% purity or higher. The selective alkylation gives little or no alkylation of the para-xylene, the most predominant species, and very little or no isomerization to the other, non-desirable isomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for producing 
para-xylene, and more particularly, the invention 
relates, in one aspect, to processes for separating 
para-xylene in exceptionally high purity from its 
isomers. There exist several technologies for recovering 
para-xylene from its mixture with other xylene isomers 
including ortho-xylene, meta-xylene and ethylbenzene. 
Adsorption-based methods and crystallization-based 
processes are commonly used in industry. These two 
processes can produce 99.6 to 99.8 wt.% purity para-xylene 
very efficiently. Achieving purities on the 
order of 99.9+ wt.%, however, is very difficult and 
costly. Other techniques for xylene separation such as 
hydrogen-fluoride extraction, sulfonation and 
alkylation have not been able to demonstrate an 
efficiency comparable to that of the adsorption and 
crystallization processes. The chemistry for xylenes alkylation has been 
studied for several decades. D. Nightingale, et al. in 
"Orientation Effects in the Alkylation of m-Xylene by 
Various Procedures and Reagents," Journal of the 
American Chemical Society, Vol. 64, pp. 1662-1665, 
1942; and D. Nightingale, et al. in "The Alkylation of 
o- and p-Xylene," Journal of the American Chemical 
Society, Vol. 66, pp. 154-155, 1944, indicate that 
ortho-xylene, meta-xylene and ethylbenzene can be 
alkylated with molecules containing tertiary butyl 
moiety (e.g. isobutylene, tertiary butyl chloride,  
 
tertiary butyl benzene, di-tertiary butyl hydroxyl 
toluene, etc.). Para-Xylene, however, was found to be 
quite difficult for tertiary butylation. It is 
theorized that a steric effect has hindered the 
insertion of the bulky tertiary butyl group to the 
more restricted aromatic ring of the para-xylene 
molecule. Partial separation of para-xylene from 
meta-xylene and ortho-xylene based on the selective 
alkylation concept has been demonstrated; see, e.g., 
US-A-2,648,713; US-A-2,801,271 and B. B. Corson, et 
al., Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 48, 
No. 7, pp. 1180, 1956. US-A-2,648,713 provides a process for the 
separation of ortho-xylene from an admixture thereof 
with meta-xylenes by the successive steps of 
alkylation, distillation and dealkylation. Para-Xylene 
may also be present in the xylene mixture and 
remains unalkylated with the meta-xylene. The 
alkylating agent is preferably an olefin or 
cycloolefin having a tertiary carbon atom, such as 
isobutylene; diisobutylene; trimethylethylene; 2,4-dimethylpentene-2; 
3-methylbutene-2; 4-methylcyclohexene-1 
and
