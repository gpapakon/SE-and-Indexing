<ABSTRACT>
Anti-microbial coatings and method of forming same on medical devices are provided. The coatings are formed by depositing a biocompatible metal by vapour deposition techniques to produce atomic disorder in the coating such that a sustained release of metal ions sufficient to produce an anti-microbial effect is achieved. Preferred deposition conditions to achieve atomic disorder include a lower than normal substrate temperature, and one or more of a higher than normal working gas pressure and a lower than normal angle of incidence of coating flux. Anti-microbial powders formed by mechanical working to produce atomic disorder are also provided. The invention extends to other metal coatings and powders similarly formed so as to provide enhanced solubility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for preparing modified materials such as metal
coatings or powders in a form such that metal species are released on a sustainable basis at
an enhanced rate. In a particular aspect, the invention relates to methods of forming anti-microbial
coatings and powders of biocompatible metals which provide a sustained release of
anti-microbial metal species when in contact with body fluids or body tissues.The need for an effective anti-microbial coating is well established in the
medical community. Physicians and surgeons using medical devices and appliances ranging
from orthopaedic pins, plates and implants through to wound dressings and urinary catheters
must constantly guard against infection. An inexpensive antimicrobial coating also finds
application in medical devices used in consumer healthcare and personal hygiene products as
well as in biomedical/biotechnical laboratory equipment. The term "medical device", as used
herein and in the claims is meant to extend to all such products.The anti-microbial effects of metallic ions such as Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Ir (i.e. the
noble metals), Cu, Sn, Sb, Bi and Zn are known (see Morton, H.E., Pseudomonas in
Disinfection, Sterilization and Preservation, ed. S.S. Block, Lea and Febiger, 1977 and Grier,
N., Silver and Its Compounds in Disinfection, Sterilization and Preservation, ed. S.S. Block,
Lea and Febiger, 1977). Of the metallic ions with anti-microbial properties, silver is perhaps
the best known due to its unusually good bioactivity at low concentrations. This phenomena
is termed oligodynamic action. In modern medical practice both inorganic and organic soluble
salts of silver are used to prevent and treat microbial infections. While these compounds are
effective as soluble salts, they do not provide prolonged protection due to loss through
removal or complexation of the free silver ions. They must be reapplied at frequent intervals
to overcome this problem. Reapplication is not always practical, especially where an indwelling
or implanted medical device is involved.Attempts have been make to slow the release of silver ions during treatment by
creating silver containing complexes which have a lower level of solubility. For example, 
U.S. Patent 2,785,153 discloses colloidal silver protein for this purpose. Such compounds are
usually formulated as creams. These compounds have not found wide applicability in the
medical area due to their limited efficacy. The silver ion release rate is very slow.
