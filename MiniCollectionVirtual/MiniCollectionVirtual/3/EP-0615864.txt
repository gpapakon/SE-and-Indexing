<ABSTRACT>
A method for mechanically enveloping a plurality of 
documents, wherein the documents (1'-3') of original 

residence in the different document stations (1-3) of 
the enveloping machine (M) are stacked on each other on 

a conveyor (4) travelling first through the document 
stations and then through an envelope station (K) where 

the stack is removed from the conveyor and placed in an 
envelope (10). According to the invention, the envelope 

station (K) is temporarily converted, prior to placing 
the document stack in the envelope, into a wrapping station 

(S) for wrapping the document stack with a strip 
(5). The package consisting of the document stack and 

the wrapper strip is then handled as a document (7') in 
one of the document stations (1-3) for conveyance by 

means of the conveyor (4) to the envelope station (K) 
now restored. The temporary conversion of the envelope 

station into wrapping station is carried out substantially 
by employing a wrapper supply in the wrapping 

station instead of an envelope supply, where each wrapper 
(5) in the wrapping supply consists of said strip, 

which is folded in such a manner that the enveloping 
machine is able to handle it substantially as an envelope 

(10) intended for the envelope station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
mechanically enveloping a plurality of documents. A method of this type is used e.g. for sending out 
printed advertising articles, information material etc., 
which may consist of single sheets and/or pamphlets, 
often of different size. These articles, or documents, 
are put into a common envelope, thus reducing postal 
charges. The enveloping machines comprise a conveyor which 
runs through fixed stations, where a document is deposited 
on the conveyor so that the documents from the 
stations form a stack on the conveyor. In an enveloping 
station, the stack is pushed into an envelope which 
after sealing is ready for dispatch. It will be appreciated that the number of mechanically 
enveloped documents is determined by the number of 
document stations. Commercially available machines have 
a varying number of document stations. Difficulties will arise if the operator of an enveloping 
machine wishes to envelop more documents than the 
number for which the machine is designed. Then, the 
extra documents must be put into the envelopes manually, 
with increased labour costs as a result, or be separately 
enveloped in the machine and be sent out by a separate 
dispatch, with increased costs for mechanical enveloping 
and postage as a result. The object of the invention is to overcome the 
above-mentioned problem. This object is achieved by means of the process as 
recited in the appended claims. By the method according to the invention, it is 
possible to increase the capacity of an existing enveloping 
machine having n document stations, i.e. its  
 
ability to envelop n documents, to a maximum of n x n 
documents, the envelope to be dispatched containing n 
wrappers, each of which contains n documents. Of course, 
the method can be used for enveloping fewer documents, 
some of which are held in a wrapper. It is known to put into an envelope to be dispatched 
at least one smaller document-containing envelope. 
The drawback then is that several envelopes have 
to be opened in a dispatch, the costs for manufacturing 
envelopes being relatively high. Besides, it is rather 
complicated to apply print on an envelope blank, since 
it is important that the print be accurately positioned. The invention will now be described in more detail 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which 
Fig. 1 shows the principle of the mode of operation 
of a conventional enveloping machine and the principle 
of the invention, and Fig. 2 shows the dimensional relations

<CLAIMS>
A method for mechanically enveloping a plurality 
of documents, wherein the documents (1'-3') of original 

residence in the different document stations (1-3) of 
the enveloping machine (M), are stacked on each other on 

a conveyor (4) travelling first through said document 
stations and then through an envelope station (K) where 

the document stack is removed from the conveyor and 
placed in an envelope (10), characterised by 

the steps, prior to placing said document stack in the 
envelope, of temporarily converting the envelope station 

(K) into a wrapping station (S) for wrapping the 
document stack with a strip (5), and of thereafter 

handling the package consisting of the document stack 
and the wrapper strip as a document (7') in one of said 

document stations (1-3) for conveyance by means of the 
conveyor (4) to the envelope station (K) now restored, 

the temporary conversion of the envelope station into 
wrapping station being carried out substantially by 

employing in the wrapping station a wrapper supply 
instead of an envelope supply, where each wrapper (5) 

in the wrapper supply consists of said strip, which is 
folded in such a manner that the enveloping machine is 

capable of handling it substantially as an envelope (10) 
intended for the envelope station. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the transverse dimension of the 

strip is substantially smaller than the transverse 
dimension of the envelope and substantially smaller than 

the maximum dimension of the largest document for which 
the envelope (10) is intended.
