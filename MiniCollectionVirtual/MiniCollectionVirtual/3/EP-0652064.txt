<ABSTRACT>
The trimming tool is formed by a hollow cylindrical 
grip 1 into which is inserted a hollow cone 2, the 

inner and outer surfaces of which are formed, 
respectively, by adjacent blades 2a and 2b. 
The tool may be used from both ends of the cylindrical 
grip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention consists in a manual tool for 
eliminating burrs which form around cut rims of 
metal pipes particularly, and, more generally, of both 
metal and plastic pipes by cutting with small saws or 
other suitable tools. More in particular, it consists in a universal tool, 
manually operated, in order to eliminate burrs from 
cut rims of pipes made of steel, copper and 
alluminium, and to create, both on the inner and outer 
surfaces, of said cut rims, an indispensable bevelling 
in order to obtain a water-tight connection between 
pipes and branch-pipe fittings. As is known, to trim the cut rims of small diameter 
metal pipes destined for hydraulic use, assemblers 
use manual tools, varying in name, although having the 
same function, like, trimming tools, bevelling tools 
or flaring tools. One of the said tools, used to bevel both the inner 
and outer surfaces of cut rims of metal pipes, 
consists in a plastic hollow cone, upon which are 
applied, along three dephased generatrixes of 120°, 
and both on the inner and outer surfaces, three sharp, 
forged cutting edges: the cone is contained within a  
 
cylindrical body which acts as a grip. Another tool to trim and flare the inner part of the 
cut rim of the pipe, is formed by a metal cone in HSS 
steel, the outer surface of which is worked so as to 
form adjacent cutting edges, being slightly helicoidal 
in shape, and which, nearly follow the course of the 
generatrixes of the cone: such a tool allows for an 
effective flaring of the inner cut rim of the pipe, 
even with limited rotations. The first type tools present various drawbacks. In fact, the limited number of cutting edges requires 
rotations of at least 120° of the axis of the tube, in 
respect to that of the tool, in order to carry out an 
initial scraping of the cut rim to be trimmed: each 
additional scraping requires a further rotation of 
120°. Moreover, the cutting edges of the tool may easily 
become detached from the inner and outer surfaces of 
the cone and break if excessive pressure is exerted on 
the cut rim of the pipe. The second type of trimming tool allows only for the 
trimming and flaring of the inner surface of the cut 
rim of the pipe and, therefore, in order to carry out 
the bevelling of the outer surface, it is necessary to 
have another suitable tool available for trimming.  The aim of the trimming tool according to the 
invention is to eliminate the above mentioned 
drawbacks. The invention, as characterized in the claims, solves 
the problem of obtaining a

<CLAIMS>
"Trimming tool to trim cut rims of both metal and 
plastic pipes" characterized by a hollow cylindrical 

grip (1) into which a hollow cone (2), made of steel 
for tools, is solidly inserted, both the inner and 

outer surfaces of cone being formed by adjacent 
blades, having rectilinear axes (2a) and (2b) 

respectively, positioned along the generatrix of the 
same cone, the section of the blades being triangular, 

decreasing from the base of the said cone and arriving 
at the vertex where it tapers into a point. 
Trimming tool as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the cutting edges (2a) and (2b) of the cone, 

which carry out the trimming of, respectively, the 
inner and outer surfaces of the cut rim of the pipe, 

are alternately accessible from both ends of the 
cylindrical grip. 
Trimming tool as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
combination of a hollow cylindrical body (1), acting 

as a grip, and a cone (2), of steel for tools, the 
inner and outer surfaces of which are formed by 

rectilinear axis blades having a triangular section, 
the cone being made solid to the inner surface of the 

cylindrical grip so that its axis coincides with the 
axis of the same above mentioned cylindrical grip, the 

 
axis of the same above mentioned cylindrical grip, the 

area of the section of each blade decreasing beginning 
from the base of the cone and arriving at the vertex, 

where it tapers into a point. 
Trimming tool as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the blades, realised using slotters or other 

suitable manufacturing processes, are of the same 
material for tools which forms the cone (2) inserted 

into the inside of the grip of the same trimming tool. 
Application of the trimming tool, as in the 
preceding Claims, to trim and bevel both the inner and 

outer surfaces of cut rims of metal or plastic pipes 
of any diameter, by means of a hollow cone, of steel 

for tools, fitted with blades having rectilinear axes 
and a triangular section which decreases beginning 

from the base of the cone, the axes of the said blades 
being positioned along the generatrixes, both on the 

inner and outer surfaces of same cone.
