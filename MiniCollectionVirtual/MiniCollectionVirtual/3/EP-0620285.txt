Injection equipment for the supply of gas and/or 
particulate material in the form of powder, granules, 

chips or similar to a liquid, for example metal melt, 
comprising a rotation body (1) which is designed to b

lowered down into the liquid and which is mounted on 

and driven via a shaft (2) of a drive unit (4,7). The 
material and/or gas is supplied to the liquid through 

the rotor via a coaxial bore in the shaft. The special 
feature of this equipment is that the rotation body has 

a cone-like or funnel-like design and is generally 
completely open at the bottom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns injection equipment for the supply
of gas and/or particulate material in the form of powder,
granules, chips or similar to a liquid, for example metal melt,
comprising a rotation body which is designed to be lowered down
into the liquid and which is mounted on and driven via a shaft of
a drive unit.Previous equipment and methods are known for processing and
adding particulate material to a liquid as stated above. Thus,
EP-A-151434 concerns a rotor for processing and adding material
to a liquid, whereby the rotor comprises a rotationally
symmetrical hollow body and whereby the material is added to the
liquid via a rotating tube or a bore of the rotor shaft and
onwards out through a hole in the side of the hollow body
together with the liquid which, on account of centripetal force,
is sucked in through an opening in the base and circulated
through the body. Even if this rotor in itself causes the
material to be well mixed in the melt, over time the material
will build up inside the tube and rotor, especially where large
particles are involved, and eventually block it up completely.Similar equipment is disclosed in EP-A-396267 or in EP-A-495581.DE-A-2622236 relates to an equipment for the supply of material
to a metal melt comprising a rotor shaped as a cone, and where
material is supplied to the melt through a bore in the rotor 
shaft. This equipment has no stationary pipe provided in the bore
of the shaft, but a lower part of a material holding container is
protruding shortly into the upper part of the bore.Usually, cone-shaped bottom of the rotor serres
to avoid clogging as in US-A-4004919 or
in EP-A-395138.Furthermore, EP-A-0065854 describes a procedure for removing
alkaline and earth-alkaline metals from aluminium melts whereby
aluminium fluoride is introduced in powder form into an eddy
produced in the melt. Processing takes place in a cylindrical
container with the ability to hold 3-5 tonnes of aluminium melt.
This known method requires a lot of agitation of the melt to
obtain the desired effect. However, such powerful agitation is
not desirable as it causes air to be pumped into the melt.
Furthermore, the quantity of aluminium fluoride which is required
to process each tonne of melt is relatively high.Other generally known methods (cf., for example, Norwegian patent
application no. 881370 corresponding to EP-A-285566) involve adding the powder to a melt by
means of a carrier gas through one or more lances. The
disadvantages of using lances are that the consumption of

Injection equipment for the supply of gas and/or
particulate material in the form of powder, granules,

needles or similar to a liquid, for example metal melt,
comprising a rotation body (1) which is designed to be

lowered down into the liquid and which is mounted on and
driven via a shaft (2) of a drive unit (4,7), disposing means

to supply the material to the liquid through the rotation body (1) via
a tube (3) passing coaxially through a bore in the shaft

(2), and where the tube (3), stretching through the whole
length of the bore, is stationary and is arranged with a

clearance in relation to the bore in the shaft (2) so
that an annulus (10) is formed between them, said annulus (10) communicating with a pipe connection (11) and that

the rotation body (1) has a shape of a cone or a funnel
and being completely open at the bottom,
characterised in that

said pipe connection is further connected to gas exhaust means through a valve (12) whereby the liquid
level within the rotation body and return of gas from

the rotation body can be controlled.
