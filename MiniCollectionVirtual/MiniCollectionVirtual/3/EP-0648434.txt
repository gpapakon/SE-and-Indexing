<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making edible mousses such as fruit mousses, based on purée, gelatin and cream. The purée is mixed together with a composition made up of gelatin containing a finely dispersed filler, a composition mainly made up of a mixture of gelatin and emulsifier is then incorporated into the mixture thus obtained, and the resulting composition, to which a cream-based composition has been added, is then whisked, thus directly producing the edible mousse. The invention also relates to the edible mousse produced using this process, to a composition used in making the mousse and to a process for making this composition.

Process for the manufacture of food mousses such as fruit mousses, based on
purée, gelatin and cream, 
characterized by
 the fact of : mixing the purée with a
composition consisting of gelatin containing a finely dispersed filler ; incorporating into

the mixture thus obtained, a composition mainly consisting of a mixture of gelatin and
emulsifier; treating with a beater the composition thus obtained, to which a cream-based

composition has been added, which makes it possible to obtain the food mousse directly.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact of preparing a fruit mousse
by using fruit purée.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact
that the filler dispersed in the gelatin which is mixed with the purée consists of a food

powder which is not appreciably soluble in molten gelatin.
Process according to claim 3, 
characterized by
 the fact that the food powder is a
milk protein or plant protein powder.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact
that the mixture of gelatin and filler contains between 1 to 8% by weight and preferably

between 2 and 5% by weight of filler.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact
that the composition based on gelatin and emulsifier which is used in the second phase of

the process contains from 15 to 50% and preferably from 25 to 35% by weight of an
emulsifier.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact of
using the gelatin-based compositions in an amount of 2.5 to 5.5 kg and preferably of 3.5

to 4.5 kg of mixture of gelatin and emulsifier per 1 kg of mixture of gelatin and filler.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact
that the gelatin containing the filler is incorporated into the purée at a sufficiently low

temperature so as to avoid to damage the taste properties of the purée.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact
that the proportion of gelatin containing the filler is from 2 to 10% by weight, and

preferably from 5 to 6% by weight relative to the purée.

characterized by
 the fact of
incorporating sugar, salt or spices into at least one of the gelatin-based compositions.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 the fact of
carrying out the second phase of the process in which the composition based on gelatin

and emulsifier is incorporated into the composition based on gelatin and purée, and of
deep-freezing the obtained composition.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized by
 the fact of using
a cream-based composition comprising one or more creams of animal or plant origin,

optionally incorporated into a milk of animal or plant origin.
Composition which makes it possible to obtain directly by mixing with a cream-based
composition, a food mousse exhibiting an overrun of about 2 to 3 times the volume

of its constituents, said composition being 
characterized by
 the fact that it consists of
purée, water, gelatin, a milk protein or plant protein powder and emulsifier, optionally

with addition of sugar, salt or spices.
