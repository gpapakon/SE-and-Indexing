<ABSTRACT>
The brake lining for disc brakes, particularly for high speed vehicles, consists of a carrier plate (10) with a holding plate (30) held on the front side of the latter by means of spacers (11) and fastening means (20) and having openings (31) for the reception of shaped bodies made of friction material arranged in baskets (41) as braking elements (40). Each braking-element basket (41) is provided with a laterally projecting base plate (42), which is brought to rest against the encircling rim of each opening (31), and is held in the contact position by means of a Belleville spring (45) supported on the carrier plate (10). Each fastening means (20) comprises a peg (50) which is secured on that wall surface (10a) of the carrier plate (10) which faces the holding plate (30), is passed through a second opening (131) formed in the holding plate (30) and that portion (50a) of which that projects from the holding plate (30) is provided with a through hole (51) which extends parallel to the holding plate (30) and is intended to receive a locking bolt (55), the locking bolt (55) being passed through the peg (50) above the holding plate (30) in such a way that the holding plate (30) is held on the carrier plate (10) by means of a clamping fit.

Brake lining for disk brakes, particularly for high 
speed trains with a one-piece or multipart supporting 

plate (10) having an attachment device or guiding 
means (12) on the rear for the brake lining and a retaining 

plate (30) mainteined at a distance on the front 
of the supporting plate (10) from the same with the aid 

of spacers (11) and fastening means (20) possessing a 
plurality of first perforations (31) for the accommodation 

of individual brake elements being comprised of 
a shaped friction material member or of a metallic basket 

(41) surrounding the shaped friction material member 
in a casing-like fashion and open at the top, whose bottom 

plate (42), in comparison with the basket wall (43), 
projects laterally and possesses a larger diameter in 

comparison with the diameter of each first perforation 
(31), in which case each brake element basket (41) is 

passed through the first perforation (31) of the retaining 
plate (30) in such a way that the external circumferential 

area (42a) comes to bear against the wall 
area (30a) facing the supporting plate (10), while the 

brake element basket (41) is maintained in the bearing 
position with the aid of a cup spring (45) resting on 

the supporting plate (10),
 
characterized in that
 
each fastening means (20) is comprised of a stud or pin 

(50) fixed to the wall area (10a) facing the retaining 
plate (30) of the supporting plate (10) and passed 

through a second perforation (131) formed in the retaining 
plate (30), whose section (50a) projecting from 

the retaining plate (30) is provided with a through bore 
(51) proceeding parallellly to the retaining plate (30) 

for the accommodation of a lockbolt or split pin (55)  
 

in the form of a locking means, in which case the lockbolt 
or split pin (55) is passed through the stud or 

pin (50) above the retaining plate (30) in such a way 
that the retaining plate (30) is retained on the supporting 

plate (10) by means of the cup springs (45) that 
rest with one end on the supporting plate (10) and on 

the brake element baskets (41) and the supporting of 
the retaining plate (30) connected with this on the 

lockbolts or split pins (55) by means of press fit. 
Brake lining for disk brakes, particularly for high 
speed trains, with a one-piece or multipart supporting 

plate (10) having an attachment device or guiding means 
(12) on the rear for the brake lining and a retaining 

plate (30) maintained at a distance on the front of 
the supporting plate (10) from the same with the aid 

of spacers (11) and fastening means (20) possessing a 
plurality of first perforations (31) for the accommodation 

of individual brake elements (40), each of said 
individual brake emements being comprised of a shaped 

friction material member or of a metallic basket (41) 
surrounding the shaped friction material member in a 

casing-like fashion while open at the top, whose bottom 
plate (42), in comparison with the basket wall (43), 

projects laterally and possesses a larger diameter in 
comparision with the diameter of each first perforation 

(31), in which case each brake element basket 
(41) is passed through the first perforation (31) of 

the retaining plate (30) in such a way that the external 
circumferential area (42a) of the basket bottom 

plate (42) comes toO bear against the wall area (30a) 
facing the supporting plate (10), while the brake 

element basket (41) is maintained in the bearing position 
with the aid of a cup spring (45) resting on  

 
the supporting plate (10),
 
characterized in that
 
each fastening means (20) is comprised of a stud or pin 

(50) fixed to the wall area (10a) facing the retaining 
plate (30) of the supporting plate (10) and passed 

through a second perforation (131) formed in the retaining 
plate (30), whose section (50a) projecting from 

the the retaining plate (30) is locked with the aid of 
a snap ring or spring ring in the form of a locking 

means, in which case the snap ring or spring ring is 
disposed above the the retaining plate (30) in such a 

way that the retaining plate (30) is retained on the 
supporting plate (10) by means of the cup springs (45) 

resting with one end on the supporting plate (10) and 
on the brake element baskets (41) and the supporting 

of the retaining plate (30) connected herewith on the 
snap ring or spring ring with the aid of press fit. 
Brake lining according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the stud or pin (50), on its upper end (50a) possessing 

the through bore (51) for the lockbolt or split pin (55), 
below the through bore (51), carries a ring (56) laterally 

projecting from the wall area (50a) which is rigidly 
connected to the stud or pin, which is disposed 

at a distance from the through bore (51) which corresponds 

to the thickness of the retaining plate (30). 
Brake lining according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the stud or pin (50), on its upper end (50a) possessing 

the through bore (51) for the lockbolt or split pin 
(55), is constricted in a neck-like fashion while forming 

an annular supporting area (50d) circumferentially 
below the through bore (51), which is disposed at a 

distance from the through bore (51), which corresponds 
to the thickness of the retaining plate (30).  

 
Brake lining according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that
 
the stud or pin (50), with its end (50b) facing the 

supporting plate (10), is inserted into a drilled hole 
(16) formed in the supporting plate (10) and is rigidly 

connected to the supporting plate (10) with the aid of 
a weld joint (17). 
Brake lining according to any of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that,
 
on to the stud or pin (50), a spacer ring or spacer 

sleeve (15) is slipped for maintaining the distance 
between the retaining plate (30) and the supporting 

plate (10).
