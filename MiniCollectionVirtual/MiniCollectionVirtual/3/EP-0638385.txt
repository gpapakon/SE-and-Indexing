<ABSTRACT>
A metal cutting tool comprising a cutting insert (1) having a cutting 
portion (7) and a tail portion (9) formed integrally therewith, 

a tool holder (2) having 
a holder head portion (18) formed with an insert retaining pocket (20) 

adapted to 
receive the insert tail portion (9) and a clamping screw (3). Upon 

the tail portion (9) 
being received in the pocket (20), a tail portion base (11) bears 

on a pocket base (22) and 
tail portion side walls (12) are disposed adjacent pocket side walls 

(23). Insertion of 
the clamping screw (3) into a through bore (15) of the tail portion 

aligned with a 
threaded pocket bore (26) and consequent screw coupling of a screw thread 

portion (6) in the threaded pocket bore (26) results in a clamping 
portion (4) of the 

screw bearing clampingly against a clamping engaging portion (17) of the 
tail 

portion through bore. As a consequence, the tail portion base (11) is 
biased 

against the pocket base (22) and a tail terminal portion (13) is biased 
towards an inner 

portion of the pocket (20) so as to ensure a contact between clamping 
surfaces 

of the side walls (12) of the tail portion and of the side walls (23) 
of the pocket (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal cutting tool comprising 
an exchangeable hard metal cutting insert replaceably mounted on a tool 
holder and particularly used in operations such as milling, drilling and 
turning. The invention is particularly related to cutting tools having a small 
cutting diameter, e.g. of approximately 6 to 30 mm. With tools having such small cutting diameters the body of the 
insert as well as the tool holder are of restricted dimensions and this, in its 
turn, restricts the possibilities for reliably mounting the insert in the tool. There is disclosed in U.S. 4,344,724 a cutting tool consisting of 
a cutter head formed with a pair of jaws defining a slot therebetween within 
which slot a knife plate is exchangeably mounted and is secured in position 
by a transverse clamping screw penetrating through respective bores in the 
jaws and in the plate. Such a manner of clamping is suitable only for cutting 
tools employing relatively flat cutting inserts. Furthermore, in order to 
ensure that the cutting tool has a rigid construction, the screw and consequently 
the through-bores respectively made in the plate and in the cutter 
head must have relatively large dimensions, thereby setting a limit on the 
minimum cutting diameter of the tool.  There is disclosed in US 4,850,759 a cutting tool having a small 
cutting diameter and comprising a cutting insert formed with a conical tail, 
which insert is detachably mounted in a conical cavity of a tool shaft. The 
tool is provided with a locking screw longitudinally received within the 
cavity and having an innermost, externally threaded portion adapted to be 
screwed into an internally threaded portion of the cavity and an outermost, 
hook-shaped portion adapted to engage a similarly hook-shaped portion of 
the tail. Thus, when the screw cooperates with the internally threaded 
portion of the cavity the tail is pulled into the cavity with its circumferential 
conical surface contacting the conical surface of the cavity. However, the 
specifically shaped engaging portions of the cutting body and of the screw 
in combination with their small dimensions render production of such tool 
rather cumbersome, especially in view of the fact that in this case final 
precise machining operations, such as grinding, polishing, etc., which usually 
follow powder metallurgy process of manufacturing tools of this kind, have 
to be carried out manually rendering the whole production complicated and 
expensive. It is the object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A metal cutting tool comprising 
   a cutting insert (1) having a cutting portion (7) and a support 

portion (9) formed integrally therewith; 
   a tool holder (2) having a holder head portion (18) formed with 

an insert retaining pocket (20) adapted to receive said insert support portion 
(9); 

   said insert support portion (9) being formed with a support 
portion through bore (15) and said retaining pocket (20) being formed with 

a threaded pocket bore (26), the bores (15, 26) being adapted to be aligned 
when said support portion (9) is received in said pocket (20); and 

   screw means (3) for insertion into said aligned bores (15, 26) so 
as to screw clamp said support portion (9) in said pocket (20); 

   characterised in that 
   said support portion (9) constitutes a tail portion (9) having a base 

(11) and a pair of side walls (12) substantially perpendicular to said base 
(11) which side walls (12) converge towards each other from the cutting 

portion (7) to a tail terminal portion (13) remote from the cutting portion 
(7), said support portion through bore (15) being formed, adjacent a rim 

thereof, with a clamping engaging portion (17) adjacent said tail terminal 
portion (13); 

   said insert retaining pocket (20) being defined by a pocket base 
(22) and a pair of pocket side walls (23) which converge towards each other 

from a leading end (19) of said holder head portion (18) to an inner portion 
of said pocket (20) remote from said leading end (19) at an angle corresponding 

to an angle between the converging side walls (12) of the tail 
portion (9); and

 
   said screw means (3) comprising a clamping screw (3) having an 

upper clamping portion (4) and a screw thread portion (6) and being adapted
