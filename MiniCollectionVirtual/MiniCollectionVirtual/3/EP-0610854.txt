<ABSTRACT>
A compression-moldable composition comprising an 
active ingredient, an excipient and an oily or fatty 

substance having a lower melting point of about 20 to 
90°C is compression-molded into uncoated tablets without 

coating to improve the abrasion resistance. The 
oily or fatty substance includes a higher fatty acid or 

a salt thereof, a wax, a fatty acid ester, a hardened 
oil, a polyalkylene oxide, etc., and the amount thereof 

is about 0.01 to 10% by weight. The composition may 
comprise (1) a granulated powder containing the active 

ingredient and the excipient, and the powdery or granular 
oily or fatty substance having a lower melting 

point, or (2) a granulated powder containing the active 
ingredient, the excipient and said oily or fatty substance. 

Compression-molding of the composition improves 
the abrasion resistance of the tablet and significantly 

inhibits the development of powder by wearing 
or abrasion even when the oily or fatty substance 

is used in a small amount of about 0.1 to 0.5% by 
weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an uncoated
tablet having an improved abrasion resistance and
usable in a variety of fields such as foods and drugs,
and a method of producing such a tablet.Tablets can be classified into two major categories,
i.e. (i) an uncoated tablet prepared by compression-molding
fine granules, granules or a mixed powder
and (ii) a coated tablet prepared by coating an uncoated
tablet with a film or sugar. When the uncoated
tablet has a curved surface, it may have problems with
moldability. Thus, the uncoated tablet is usually
molded into a flat form in order to insure productivity
and handling efficiency.Since the coated tablet has a smooth and mechanically
strong surface, no powder is broken out due to
wear or abrasion. Therefore, the coated tablet has
advantages that it can be employed in a visual examination
machine with a high handling and packaging efficiency,
as well as in an automatic compounding machine
in a hospital or pharmacy with an excellent handling
efficiency. The coating layer of the coated tablet, 
however, suppresses disintegration of the tablet and
dissolution of an active ingredient, thus it is unsuitable
for a pharmaceutical preparation wherein fast
disintegration or dissolution is required. Further,
the coated tablet has disadvantages of being high
costed owing to a large number of production steps.On the contrary, though the above-mentioned uncoated
tablet can be advantageously produced with ease
and simplicity and with a low production cost, the
surface thereof is worn or abraded in preparation or
transportation process, and powder thus produced is
attached or affixed to the surface of the uncoated
tablet or remained in a package. Thus, the commercial
value of the products is significantly reduced. Further,
because of the powder attached or affixed to the
tablet, the working efficiency in a visual examination
machine and packaging efficiency may be reduced.
Furthermore, the uncoated tablet also confronts with a
lower working efficiency in an automatic compounding
machine.Regarding the techniques to suppress such development
of powder due to wearing and abrading of an uncoated
tablet, Japanese Patent Publication No. (JP-B)
25926/1992 discloses a coating method which comprises
preparing a suspension or dispersion containing a
higher fatty acid ester having a high melting point of 
70°C or more, a cellulose derivative soluble in a
hydrophilic solvent and the hydrophilic solvent and
coating the surface of an uncoated tablet with said
suspension or dispersion in
