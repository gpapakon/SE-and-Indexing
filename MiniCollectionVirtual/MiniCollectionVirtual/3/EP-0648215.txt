<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of trialkyl 
compounds of Group 3a metals. These organometallic compounds find 
increasing use in the semiconductor industry. In this industry a 
Group 3a metal compound is deposited onto suitable substrates, 
generally together with one or more compounds of a Group 5 element, 
such as arsenic or phosphorus. The deposition of such compounds can 
be carried out via the decomposition of organometallic compounds 
from the vapour phase. Such decomposition is known as Metal Organic 
Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD). When epitaxial layers are grown 
from such decomposition the technique is better known as Metal 
Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). A convenient route for the preparation of such trialkyl 
compounds is via the reaction of Group 3a metal chlorides with 
either a Grignard reagent, viz. an alkylmagnesium halide, or an 
alkyllithium compound. A disadvantage of these methods resides in 
the use of the Group 3a metal chlorides, which are difficult to 
obtain in the high purity that is required for further use in the 
semiconductor industry. High purity metals are available 
commercially and represent therefore a suitable starting material 
for the preparation of trialkyl compounds of such Group 3a metals. In the preparation of alkyl compounds of Group 3a metal 
frequent use is made of elemental Group 3a metal in combination 
with magnesium. In Japanese application No. 01/301,684 the preparation of 
alkyl gallium and alkyl indium compounds is described using a 
gallium-magnesium or an indium-magnesium alloy, respectively. In UK patent specification No. 2,123,423 a process for the 
preparation of trimethylgallium or triethylgallium is described in 
which an alloy Ga2Mg5 is reacted with methyl iodide in the presence  
 
of an ether. The ether may be a relatively volatile ether, such as 
diethyl ether, or an ether with a relatively high boiling point, 
e.g. di-isopentyl ether or diphenyl ether. The use of magnesium has the drawback that commercially pure 
magnesium still contains minor amounts of zinc and silicon. Because 
unintentional zinc and silicon doping in the MOCVD or MOVPE of 
trialkyl compounds of Group 3a metals needs to be avoided, it would 
be desirable if different metals or alloys could be used in 
combination with Group 3a elements. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the 
preparation of trialkyl compounds of Group 3a metals, in which a 
Group 3a metal is contacted with an alkyl halide in the presence of 
an alkali
