<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic single-pass multiple station 
multi-colour printer for forming an image onto a web 

(12), eg of paper, is described. The printer comprises a 
plurality of toner image-producing electrostatographic 

printing stations (A, B, C, D, E) each having rotatable 
endless surface means (26) such as the photoconductive 

surface of a cylindrical drum (24) onto which a toner 
image can be formed. The paper web (12) is conveyed in 

succession past the printing stations (A, B, C, D, E). 

The speed and tension of the web (12) is controlled while 
it is running past the printing stations (A, B, C, D, E). 

Guiding rollers (36) which determine for the web (12) 
wrapping angles (ω) of about 15° about the drum surface. 

A corona device transfers the toner image on each drum 
onto the web (12). The corona device, the wrapping 

angles ω and the web tension are such that adherent 
contact of the web (12) with the drum surface (26) is 

such that the moving paper web (12) controls the 
peripheral speed of the drum in synchronism with the 

movement of said web. Slippage between the drum surface 
(26) and the paper web (12) is thereby eliminated, 

enabling accurate registration of superimposed images on 
the paper web (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatographic single-pass 
multiple station (for example multi-colour) printer, 
in particular such a printer as is capable of printing 
colour images for professional purposes as a cost 
effective alternative to conventional printing of short 
to medium sized runs. Electrostatographic printing operates according to the 
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as 
described, eg, in "Principles of Non-Impact Printing" by 
Jerome L Johnson (1986) - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 
92715 USA). Electrostatographic printing includes electrographic 
printing in which an electrostatic charge is deposited 
image-wise on a dielectric recording member as well as 
electrophotographic printing in which an overall 
electrostatically charged photoconductive dielectric 
recording member is image-wise exposed to conductivity 
increasing radiation producing thereby a "direct" or 
"reversal" toner-developable charge pattern on said 
recording member. "Direct" development is a positive-positive 
development, and is particularly useful for 
reproducing pictures and text. "Reversal" development is 
of interest in or when from a negative original a 
positive reproduction has to be made or vice-versa, or  
 
when the exposure derives from an image in digital 
electrical signal form, wherein the electrical signals 
modulate a laser beam or the light output of light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs). It is advantageous with respect 
to a reduced load of the electric signal modulated light 
source (laser or LEDs) to record graphic information (eg 
printed text) in such a way that the light information 
corresponds with the graphic characters so that by 
"reversal" development in the exposed area of a 
photoconductive recording layer, toner can be deposited 
to produce a positive reproduction of the electronically 
stored original. In high speed electrostatographic 
printing the exposure derives practically always from 
electronically stored, ie computer stored information. As used herein, the term "electrostatographic" also 
includes the direct image-wise application of 
electrostatic charges on an insulating support, for 
example by ionography. In the electrophotographic art, an electrostatographic 
single-pass multiple station multi-colour printer is 
known, in which an image is formed on a photoconductive 
belt and is then transferred to a paper receiving sheet 
or web whereon the toner image is fixed, whereupon the 
web is usually cut into sheets containing the desired 
print frame. In an
