<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous pigment ink composition for writing utensils is provided, 
which is capable of providing handwritings with good 

opacifying properties and exhibits little difference in whiteness 
between handwritings obtained immediately after writing and after 

drying. When the composition is applied to the inner stick type 
of writing utensils, an ink having good opacifying properties is 

passed out. The ink composition comprises, at least, an emulsion 
of styrene resin-based doughnut-shaped flat particles as a white 

opacifying agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous pigment ink composition
for writing utensils and More particularly, to an aqueous
pigment ink composition for writing utensils which is particularly
suitable for use in inner stick-type writing or handwriting
utensils.Conventional aqueous pigment ink compositions generally
comprise, as an opacifying agent, white pigments having a large
size and a great specific gravity, typical of which are titanium
oxide particles, in order to impart opacifying power or opacity
to handwritings. However, because of the poor dispersibility of
the white pigment, such an ink composition is unlikely to use,
for example, as an ink composition for so-called "inner stick-type
marking pens" wherein the ink is allowed to pass to the pen
point from an ink occluding body through the capillary action.
When using a white pigment having a smaller size, the dispersibility
in the ink composition becomes better. However, the
composition has not good opacifying properties, with the opacity
of handwritings being not ensured.In Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication SHO 63-145380 and
SHO 63-145382, for example, aqueous white pigment ink compositions
have been proposed in which there are formulated hollow
resin particles (or spheres) called a plastic pigment along with
titanium oxide or chromatic pigments. Unexamined Japanese Patent
Publication SHO 63-145381 has proposed an aqueous black pigment
ink composition which comprises hollow resin particles along with 
carbon black.The hollow resin particles exhibit good dispersibility but
are inferior in opacifying properties to, for example, titanium
oxide. If the opacifying properties are improved by using the
hollow resin particles in combination with titanium oxide, the
titanium oxide settles down, resulting in the difference in
writing density. Accordingly, it is not possible to use such a
composition for inner stick-type utensils, for example.In order to solve the above problem, Unexamined Japanese
Patent Publication SHO 63-243179 has proposed an aqueous pigment
ink composition for utensils which comprises, at least, hollow
resin particles (in a specific form) which individually contain
water therein and whose shell is formed of an acrylic-styrene
copolymer. The hollow resin particles of the aqueous pigment ink
composition individually have a shell which contains water therein
and is formed of an acrylic-styrene copolymer, and is supplied
in the form of an emulsion based on water. Although the resin
particles are hollow, they contain water in the inside
