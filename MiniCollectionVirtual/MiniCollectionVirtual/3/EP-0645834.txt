<ABSTRACT>
A lithium-manganese oxide LixMn2O4 having a spinel structure as cathode material for secondary lithium batteries is obtained by mixing manganese dioxide with lithium formate and/or lithium acetate (HCOOLi, CH3COOLi) and subsequently heating the mixture for 10 to 100 hours at preferably 600 DEG C to 750 DEG C. The mixture components contain manganese and lithium in a molar ratio Mn : Li = 2: x, where 0.5 
<
 x 
<
 1.5. The end product is extremely finely crystalline and is distinguished by good cycle stability.

Process for preparing a positive electrode for secondary 
lithium batteries, whereof the active material comprises a 

lithium manganese oxide having spinel structure, which is formed 
by spray-drying a suspension of manganese dioxide in an aqueous 

solution of lithium formate and/or lithium acetate, followed by 
heating the mixture, with the mixture being heated at a 

temperature of from 600 to 750°C for between 10 and 100 hours and 
then ground. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the manganese oxide 
is a chemically generated product (CMD) or a β-MnO
2
 (pyrolusite). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, in which the 
constituents of the mixture contain manganese and lithium in a 

molar ratio of Mn : Li of 2 : x, where 0.5 
<
 x 
<
 1.5, preferably 
0.9 
<
 x 
<
 1.2.
