<ABSTRACT>
A foamed polyvinylchloride (PVC) material is obtained by mixing 100 parts by weight of PVC with 0.5-6 
parts by weight 

of sodium alkyl sulphonate, forming the obtained composition, and subsequent foaming by heating at 190 - 
300 °C during 3 to 

20 min. Forming is effected either under 0.5 - 400 MPa and at 20-170 °C with subsequent heating to 140 - 
150 °C in a closed 

volume, or in free state, in the form of a layer of 2 - 16 mm thick. In the latter case the layer before forming may be subjected to 
compacting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the compositions for producing
foamed polyvinylchloride (PVC) materials and to the methods
of their production.It is known, that foamed PVC materials with improved
physical and mechanical properties, e.g. high elasticity and
thermostability, very often are multicomponent systems,
including a number of specially aimed additives: foaming,
stabilizing and cross-linking agents, fillers, lubricants,
etc.There is known a six-component composition for producing
foamed PVC material (US Patent No. 4434251, C 08 J 9/1⊘,
published in 1984), consisting of PVC, plasticizer
(dioctylphthalate), stabilizing agent (tribasic and dibasic
lead stearate), bubble nucleation agent (calcium carbonate),
cross-linking agent (triallyl isocyanurate), foaming agent
(azodicarbonamide).From this reference there is known the method of foamed
material production, comprising mixing of PVC,
dioctylphthalate, lead stearate, calcium carbonate, triallyl
isocyanurate and azodicarbonamide on the rollers, molding the
mixture at 15⊘°C to obtain 1 mm thickness sheet material, its
radiation by an electron effluent of 6 to 1⊘ Mrad and the
following heating on wire screen at 22⊘°C. The material
produced according to this method has the apparent density of
⊘.1⊘-⊘.12 g/cm3, and the gel content is 28-35%.There is known a six-component composition for producing
foamed PVC material (Japanese Pat. Applic. No. 58-1729,
C 08 J 9/⊘6, published in 1983), consisting of PVC,
plasticizer (esters of phthalic or phosphoric acid),
stabilizing agent (organotin derivatives), cross-linking
agent (trimethylol propane triacrylate, triallyl
isocyanurate), foaming agent (azodicarbonamide), filler
(chalk, magnesium oxide, talc).From this reference there is known the method of foamed
material production, comprising mixing of PVC, plasticizer,
stabilizing agent, cross-linking agent, foaming agent and
filler on the rollers at 14⊘-165°C, molding the mixture at
15⊘°C to obtain 1 mm thickness sheet material, its radiation
by an electrone effluent of 8 to 1⊘ Mrad and the following
heating on wire screen by hot air at 22⊘°C. The material
produced according to this method has the apparent density of
less than ⊘.3 g/cm3, and the gel content is 2⊘-6⊘%The closest prior art, according to
the technical concept, is the known two-component composition
for producing foamed PVC material, this composition consists
of 1⊘⊘ mass parts of emulsion PVC and 5-3⊘ mass parts of
polar organic liquid, in particular, the mixture of dimethyl
formamide and ethylene glycol (GB
