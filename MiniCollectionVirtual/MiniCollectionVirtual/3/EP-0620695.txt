<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
information processing system for a bidirectional
information transmission system using a broadband ISDN,
a cable television network, a public telephone network,
or the like. More particularly, the invention relates
to an information transmission method and information
storage method capable of transmitting information while
taking into consideration a change in the transmission
capacity of a network.In an information provider system using a
telephone network, for example, there are services for
providing various types of voice information and video
information by using an idle time of a telephone line.
A video communications system is constructed of central
equipments for transmitting video information, home
equipments including home peripheral terminals and video
receivers, and exchange center equipments interconnecting
central equipments and home equipments.The characteristic features of a video
communications system are as follows. Information can
be unidirectionally provided at a low cost. Video
information may be used for supplementing voice
information. Interactive services and information
retrieval services can be provided by using a 
bidirectional transmission function of each terminal
equipment.The above-described communications system uses
a constant transmission rate of information to be
transmitted over a communication line. As a result,
even if a room of line capacity is sufficient, it takes
the same time to transmit the same amount of information
to each subscriber.Although the above-described communications
system provides a function of bidirectional information
transmission, services it provides are limited and most
of the services are provided unidirectionally from
information providers. Furthermore, each central
equipment provides its own particular information so
that if the equipment has no information desired by a
subscriber, the subscriber has to inquire the
information from another information provider via a
telephone exchange. An information transmission method with the features
included in the first part of claim 1 and an information
transmission system with the features included in the
first part of claim 17 are known from EP-A-0 446 956. The
system is specifically concerned with an asynchronous transfer
mode ISDN network with a variable transmission rate used
for transmitting and receiving voice and image signals between
terminal stations. Variation of the transmission rate
occurs due to the discard of individual information units.Another
