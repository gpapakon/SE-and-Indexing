<ABSTRACT>
The method serves for the pneumatic operation of an apparatus in which at least one component (33) is pneumatically actuated. The actuation takes place with primary compressed air, which is fed to the pneumatic component (33) from a primary compressed air supply (31). In addition to the primary compressed air supply (31), use is made of at least one secondary compressed air supply (37), which is provided with a lower pressure level than the primary compressed air supply (31). After carrying out a work operation of one pneumatic component (33) with a compressed air supply from the primary compressed air supply (31), during a transitional phase a venting is carried out into the secondary compressed air supply (37). Following the transitional phase, a venting of the first pneumatic component (33) is carried out with respect to an ambient pressure. A second pneumatic work operation is fed from the secondary compressed air supply (37).

Process for the pneumatic operation of a device, in which primary operating air is 
supplied from an operating air primary supply (31) for the pneumatic actuation of 

at least one structural element (33) and in which in addition to the operating air 
primary supply (31) at least one operating air secondary supply (37) is used which 

is provided with a lower pressure level than the operating air primary supply (31), 
and in which after the performance of a working operation of a pneumatic 

structural element (33) with a compressed air supply from the operating air primary 
supply (31) a venting into the operating air secondary supply (37) is carried 

out during a transitional phase and in which after the transitional phase a venting 
of the pneumatic structural element (33) with respect to an ambient pressure is 

carried out and in which a second pneumatic working operation is supplied from 
the operating air secondary supply (37) and in which a container is produced from 

a thermoplastic synthetic material and a parison (3) is supplied after a tempering 
to a blow station (1) which has a blow mould (2) which is provided for the contour-forming 

of the container and into which the tempered parison (3) is inserted, and 
in which the parison (3) is expanded by supply of blowing air, 
characterized in that
 
the container is stretched by a stretching rod (10) and that a stretching cylinder 

(11) positioning the stretching rod (10) is supplied by the operating air secondary 
supply (37) during at least a part of the positioning movement of the stretching rod 

(10) with compressed air transferred into the operating air secondary supply (37) 
from the operating air primary supply (31) after performance of the first working 

operation, wherein a movement of the stretching rod (10) to stretch the parison (3) 
is supplied by the operating air primary supply (31) and a return stroke of the 

stretching rod (10) is supplied by the operating air secondary supply (37). 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least a part of the blowing 
air is transferred into the region of the operating air secondary supply (37) after a 

moulding of the container.  
 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the force of gravity to which 
the structural elements are exposed in different movement directions is taken into 

account when carrying out positioning movements with a vertical component 
when selecting the pressures required for the positioning movements. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 compressed air 
flowing over from the region of the operating air primary supply (31) into the 

region of the operating air secondary supply (37) is stored at least temporarily. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a local 
compressed air storage for transferred operating air is used in the region of a 

pneumatic structural element (33) which is supplied by both the operating air 
primary supply (31) and by the operating air secondary supply (37) to carry out 

different movements. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 a coupling of 
several structural units which are substantially identical in structure but are 

actuated after each other in a manner offset in time is carried out by means of the 
transfer of primary operating air flowing from the pneumatic structural element into 

the region of a further pneumatic structural element (33). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 a supply of 
secondary operating air independent of the transfer of primary operating air 

flowing from the region of the pneumatic structural element (33) is provided in the 
region of the operating air secondary supply (37). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the pneumatic 
structural element (33) is operated in such a way that compressed air transferred 

from the region of the operating air primary supply (31 ) is initially used and a 
secondary operating air flowing from an independent compressed air source is 

subsequently used to carry out a subordinate positioning movement.
