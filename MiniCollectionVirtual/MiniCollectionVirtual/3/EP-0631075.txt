<ABSTRACT>
Valve element for solenoid valve including a seat (3) and an electromagnet coil (4), the said valve element comprising the free end (10) of a core plunger (8) which can move inside the hub (5) of the said coil. It furthermore comprises an intermediate member (12) capable of coming to bear against the said seat and itself comprising a second seat (16) opposite the first seat and of cross-section (S1) smaller than that (S2) of the first seat, the said free end of the movable core plunger being capable of coming to bear on the said second seat and the movable core plunger being designed to entrain the intermediate member away from the first seat after a predetermined travel (C1) of its free end away from the second seat.
