<ABSTRACT>
An engine immobilisation system comprises a blockage device (18) operable in the exhaust duct (24) of the engine aspiration system at a location close to the engine to cause a reverse flow of gas to choke the engine. Blockage is effected by a high-temperature resistant blockage member (34) operating in a manner similar to a butterfly valve and actuated by a flexible drive cable. An electronic control system (48) actuates a stepper motor (42) to control blockage in accordance with sensed vehicle parameters including detection of unauthorised use of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
ENGINE IMMOBILISATION SYSTEMSThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for engine immobilisation applicable to the immobilisation of internal combustion engines including both diesel and petrol engines, and indeed engines using other fuels and fuel forms.An important aspect of the invention relates to the use of an engine immobilisation system as part of a vehicle security system. The invention is concerned with an engine immobilisation system utilising blockage means for the exhaust portion of the engine aspiration system. Such a device has significant advantages over other vehicle security systems including alarms, steering locks, brake locks and ignition cut-outs.However, previous proposals for engine immobilisation systems have related to the provision of blockage devices at the tail end or discharge end of the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine. Examples of such disclosure are• _„__,GB-A-22 24 539A and GB-A-21 36 873A and GB-A-21 93 531A and GB-A-21 86 911A.Such proposals suffer from several significant shortcomings including a lack of security since, as a practical matter, it would be relatively easy to remove such a device by simply sawing off the tail end portion of the exhaust pipe, using a hacksaw.In any case, these devices are not effective to immobilise an engine since the volumetric capacity of the exhaust system on the upstream side of the immobilisation device is such that the engine can start even when the device is in place and blocking the exhaust system. The engine then acts as a gas pump and severe damage can result both to the engine and to associated systems. The gas pressures developed are sufficient to blow out gaskets in the exhaust system and the reverse direction gas flow resulting from the blockage can cause serious damage to a catalytic convertor.Accordingly, it can be seen that these prior proposals 

are subject to significant shortcomings in terms of ability to resist determined attempts to remove or otherwise render inoperable the immobilisation device, and otherwise.An object of the present invention is to provide an engine immobilisation system offering improvements in relation to one or more of the matters discussed above, or generally.According to the invention there is provided a method and apparatus for engine immobilisation as defined in the accompanying claims.In an embodiment of the invention, by the provision of blockage means controllable to adopt, selectively, blocking and non-blocking conditions the advantage is provided that the

CLAIMS : -
1 Engine immobilisation apparatus for connection to the aspiration system of an internal combustion engine comprising
a) duct means to form part of the exhaust side of said aspiration system to transmit exhaust stroke gases from the engine; b) blockage means effective to block the passage of said exhaust stroke gases, said blockage means being located within said duct means; and c) said duct means being adapted to be mounted or located on the exhaust side part of said aspiration system, thereby to immobilise said engine; characterised by d) said blockage means being controllable to adopt, selectively, blocking and non-blocking conditions; e) control means for said blockage means and located outside said duct means and actuable to effect change of said blockage means between its blocking and non-blocking condition; and f) said duct means being mounted or adapted to be mounted on said exhaust side part of said aspiration system at a location upstream of the discharge end of said exhaust par .
2 Engine immobilisation apparatus for connection to the aspiration system of an internal combustion engine characterised by blockage means for the exhaust or inlet side of said aspiration system and controllable to adopt, selectively, blocking and non-blocking conditions.
3 Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised by said blockage means being adapted to be located or provided with instructions for mounting at a location between said engine and exhaust gas treatment means such as a catalytic 


converter or silencer.
4 Apparatus according to claim 3 characterised by said blockage means being adapted to be mounted nearer to said engine than to said exhaust gas treatment means thereby rapidly to choke the engine in use.
5 Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised by said duct means being adapted to be inserted into the duct of said exhaust side of said engine aspiration system to replace a short length thereof.
6 Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims characterised by said blockage means comprising a blockage member permanently located in said duct means and mounted for angular movement between blocking and non-blocking positions.
7 Apparatus according to claim 6 characterised by said blockage member being constructed and mounted in the manner of the valve member of a butterfly valve.
8 Apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised by said control means being connected to said blockage member and comprising a drive to turn said blockage member, and engine status verification means being provided to prevent operation of said drive and of said blockage member during normal operation of the engine.
9 Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims characterised by said apparatus being installed in a vehicle with said blockage means being located at a relatively inaccessible location chosen from within the engine compartment or below the body of the vehicle, and said control means for said blockage means being coupled to said blockage means by a flexible drive cable arranged to transmit drive to said blockage member from remote actuation means.
SUBSTITUTESHEET 


10 A vehicle security system comprising apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims in combination with vehicle status sensing means associated with said control means to distinguish between authorised and non-authorised use of said vehicle, and adapted to cause said control means to change said blocking means to its blocking condition upon detecting attempted non-authorised use of the vehicle.
11 A method of engine immobilisation comprising providing duct means to form part of the exhaust or inlet side of the aspiration system of an internal combustion engine, and blockage means being provided to block passage of exhaust or inlet gases through said duct means, characterised by the step of actuating said blockage means, selectively, to adopt blocking and non-blocking conditions according to requirements for immobilisation or non-immobilisation respectively.
