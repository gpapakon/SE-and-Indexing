<ABSTRACT>
Assembly of woodmoulding members (1) and fastening clips (10), for the 
protection glass, to frame paintings (3), lithographies and the like having 

a simple construction for being assembled easily and quickly, wherein the 
woodmoulding members (1) are aptly shaped and the metal clips (10), of 

reduced dimensions, are practically invisible when in place on the 
woodmouldings (2) and are provided with a resilent portion forming an 

integral part thereof which portion avoids any breaking strain of the glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention regards an assembly of elements 
of woodmouldings for frames and fastening clips 
for the protection glass, of simple structure 
and quick assembly. This assembly makes it easy any "Do it yourself" 
for those who love making these frames by 
themselves. At present, the most common assembly available 
on the market includes metal clips of large dimensions 
in comparison with the fastened frame, which 
clips embrace the whole thicknees of the woodmoulding  
 
resulting very showy. Besides, as these clips are not provided 
with any elastic dampening material, their mounting 
cause very often the breaking of the protection 
glass sheet, which naturally, is rather fragile. The assembly of the invention, instead, provides 
woodmoulding members so shaped as to cooperate 
with metal clips of reduced dimension, practically 
invisible when mounted in place. In addition, the clips are so shaped as to 
include a flexible, resilient member forming an 
integral part thereof which avoids any breaking 
strain of the glass. In fact the portion of the clip of the invention 
intended to directly contact the glass which 
glass is usually mounted to protect framed art 
subjects, is folded on itself in a very tight 
"U" shape, so that it both forms an elastic tongue 
elastically leaning against the glass and provides 
a free inner rim having no sharp edges and corners. The woodmoulding cooperating with the above 
described clip, presents a middle groove, running 
parallel to the edges thereof, having a V shaped 
cross section such to allow an easy and safe mounting 
of the clips, as better described in what  
 
follows. The assembly of the invention will be now 
described in details with reference to the annexed 
drawings, wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a perspective cross view, showing 
schematically a part of an art subject, framed 
by members according to the invention; Fig. 2 shows in perspective the cross section 
of a member with relative clip; Fig. 3 is the cross section of a woodmoulding; 
and Fig. 4 is the perspective view of a clip. Referring to fig. 1, reference numeral 1 
indicates two opposite lengths of a woodmoulding 
2 which frame painting 3 supporting also frame 
4. A groove 6 runs along the back of woodmoulding 
1, parallel to the opposite edges thereof, 
indicated by 5 and 5A, which groove has a V shaped 
cross section as better shown in fig. 3 Furthermore each member 1 has, preferably, 
an internal edge 7, shaped as a bracket, while 
edge 5A is shaped with a step as shown by 8. As stated above, clips

<CLAIMS>
Assembly of woodmoulding members for pictures 
and metal clips for fastening the protecting glass, 

having a simple structure, easy and quick to be 
assembled, including elements of woodmoulding and 

metal clips of reduced dimensions, practically 
invisible when mounted in place, having a resilient 

element integral therewith to avoid any breaking 
strain of the glass. 
The assembly woodmouldings members of Claim 
1, wherein each of said woodmoulding members 

presents a middle groove running in parallel to 
its edges, having a "V" shaped cross section, on 

a side of which one arm of said clips is engaged 
for an easier and safe engagement. 
The assembly of woodmoulding members of Claim 
2, wherein the end of each of said clips intended 

to be in contact with the glass sheet, usually 
mounted on the woodmoulding members to protect 

the framed subject, is folded on itself in a shape 
of a narrow U, so that the same both forms a resilient 

tongue leaning elastically against the glass 
and avoids any free front rim having sharp edges 

and corners.
