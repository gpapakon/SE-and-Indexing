<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary tool which is suitable for high-speed drives and which contains at one end a shank (2) for mounting in a suitable clamping device of the drive and at the other end a tool head (3, 6, 9) with an active working surface (13, 14). To improve the cooling of the tool, it is proposed that the tool head (3, 6, 9) be provided with a central inflow passage (4, 7, 10) formed as a blind hole, branching off from which are several outflow passages (5, 8, 11, 12) opening out at the working surfaces (13, 14) of the tool head.

Dental milling tool suitable for a high-speed 
drive and capable of operating in a speed range of up 

to 300,000 r.p.m., which milling tool is constructed in 
one piece and comprises at one end a shaft (2) for 

mounting in a suitable chucking device of the drive and 
at the other end a tool head (3, 6, 9) with an active 

working surface (13, 14) arranged substantially 
radially on the periphery, and which milling tool can 

be supplied from the outside with a stream of cooling 
medium directed at the active working surface of the 

tool, 
characterised in that
 the tool head (3, 6, 9) is 
provided with a central in-flow duct (4, 7, 10, 15, 16) 

formed as a blind hole from which the cooling medium is 
sucked automatically owing to a suction effect created 

in the in-flow duct by rotation of the tool, and in 
that, from the blind hole, there originate several out-flow 

ducts (5, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18) which open out on the 
working surfaces (13, 14) of the tool head and by way 

of which the cooling medium flows out. 
Tool according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 several out-flow ducts (5, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18) 
extending transversely relative to the longitudinal 

axis of the shaft, are provided on the periphery of the 
tool head (3, 9). 
Tool according to claim 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the out-flow ducts (5) are arranged distributed on 
several planes extending transversely relative to the 

longitudinal axis of the shaft. 
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 at least some of the out-flow 
ducts (12) are arranged at an angle relative to the 

tool axis that deviates from 90Â°. 
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the out-flow ducts (17, 18) leave 
the in-flow duct (15, 16) tangentially.  

 
Tool according to claim 5, 
characterised in 
that
 the out-flow ducts (17, 18) are arranged with a 
curvature in the opposite direction to the rotational 

sense of the tool. 
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the out-flow ducts (8) are formed 
as ducts that traverse the tool head (6, 9). 
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that
 the out-flow ducts (5, 8, 11, 12) 
are formed by bore holes.
