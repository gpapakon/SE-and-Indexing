<ABSTRACT>
A clamp includes a U-shaped member (10) having a pair of legs (14), 
with each leg having a cavity (16) in the side of the leg facing the other leg; and 

a clutch (11) for receiving and restraining the legs of the U-shaped member. 
Pads (20) are attached to the insides of the legs for clamping an article between 

the legs to deter the theft of such article. The clutch includes a housing (12) 
defining a pair of longitudinal channels (22) for respectively receiving the legs of 

the U-shaped member and a chamber (24) between the channels, with the 
chamber being open to the channels; two balls (26) disposed for movement 

within the chamber; a highly magnetically attractive plunger (28) disposed 
within and at one end (30) of the chamber: and a spring (38) for biasing the 

plunger to move into such contact with the balls as to force the balls against 
respective inclined surfaces (34, 36) disposed at the other end of the chamber 

for respectively guiding the balls toward different channels. When the legs of 
the U-shaped member are inserted into the channels so that the cavities are 

respectively adjacent the balls while the plunger is forcing the balls against the 
inclined surfaces, the inclined surfaces guide the balls respectively into the 

cavities and into contact with portions of the respective legs adjacent the 
respective cavities to thereby restrain the legs of the U-shaped member in the 

housing. To release the legs from the clutch, a magnet (48) is placed adjacent 
the one end (50) of the housing to magnetically attract the plunger and the balls 

toward the one end of the chamber and thereby release each ball from a locked 
position between the respective incl
ined surface and the portion of the leg that 
contacts the ball.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to clamps and is particularly 
directed to a releasable clamp that can be attached to merchandise to deter 
theft of the merchandise. Several embodiments of magnetically releasable clamps that can be attached 
to merchandise are described in United States Patent No. 5,140,836 to 
Dennis L. Hogan and Donald J. Beach. Such clamps are suited for attachment 
to jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets and watches, as well as other merchandise, 
such as eyeglasses. These clamps include a U-shaped member having a 
pair of legs and a clutch for receiving and restraining the legs of the U-shaped 
member. Pads are attached respectively to the clutch housing and the U-shaped 
member for clamping an article of merchandise between the pads when 
the legs of the U-shaped member are inserted into the clutch. The present invention provides an improved releasable clamp that is of 
less complex construction than the clamps referred to above. The clamp of the present invention includes a U-shaped member 
having a pair of legs, with at least one said leg having a cavity in the side of said 
leg facing the other said leg; and a clutch for receiving the legs of the U-shaped 
member and for restraining said at least one said leg. wherein the clutch includes 
a housing defining a pair of longitudinal channels for respectively receiving 
the legs of the U-shaped member and a chamber between the channels. 
with said chamber being open to at least one said channel; a ball disposed for 
movement within the chamber; a spring disposed at one end of the chamber for 
biasing the ball toward the other end of the chamber; and guide means disposed  
 
at the other end of the chamber for guiding the ball toward said at least 
one said channel when the ball is biased toward the other end of the chamber; 
and wherein, when the legs of the U-shaped member are inserted into said 
channels so that the cavity in said at least one said leg is adjacent the ball 
while the spring is biasing the ball toward the other end of the chamber, the 
guide means guide the ball into the cavity and into contact with a portion of 
said at least one said leg adjacent the cavity to thereby restrain the U-shaped 
member in the housing. Preferably, both legs have a said cavity, the chamber is open to both 
channels, two balls are disposed in the chamber for movement between the 
plunger and the other end of the chamber, and the guide means guide the balls 
respectively into said cavities and into contact with portions of the

<CLAIMS>
A clamp, comprising 
   a U-shaped member (10) having a pair of legs (14), with at least one 

said leg having a cavity (16) in the side of said leg facing the other said leg; and 
   a clutch (11) for receiving the legs of the U-shaped member and for 

restraining said at least one said leg, wherein the clutch includes 
   a housing (12) defining a pair of longitudinal channels (22) for respectively 

receiving the legs of the U-shaped member and a chamber (24) between 
the channels, with said chamber being open to at least one said channel; 

   a ball (26) disposed for movement within the chamber; 
   a spring (38) disposed at one end (30) of the chamber for biasing the 

ball toward the other end of the chamber; and 
   guide means (32, 34, 36) disposed at the other end of the chamber for 

guiding the ball toward said at least one said channel when the ball is biased 
toward the other end of the chamber; and 

   wherein, when the legs of the U-shaped member are inserted into said 
channels so that the cavity in said at least one said leg is adjacent the ball 

while the spring is biasing the ball toward the other end of the chamber, the 
guide means guide the ball into the cavity and into contact with a portion of 

said at least one said leg adjacent the cavity to thereby restrain the U-shaped 
member in the housing. 
A clamp according to Claim 1, wherein the guide means comprise 
an abutment wall (32) having an inclined surface (34, 36) for guiding the ball 

(26) into the cavity (16) in said at least one said leg (14). 
A clamp according to Claim 2, wherein the diameter of the ball (26) 
is greater than the shortest distance between the abutment wall (32) and the 

portion (46) of said at least one said leg (14) that contacts the ball.
