<ABSTRACT>
An improved fiber reinforced glass composite includes a refractory fiber in a matrix of a nitrogen-containing black glass ceramic having the empirical formula SiNzCxOy where x ranges from greater than zero up to about 2.0, preferably 0.1 to 1.0, y ranges from 0.5 up to about 3.0, preferably 0.7 to 1.8, and z ranges from above zero up to about 1.5, preferably 0.2 to 1.0. Preferably the black glass ceramic is derived from cyclosiloxane monomers containing a vinyl group attached to silicon and/or a hydride-silicon group. The cyclosiloxane monomers are polymerized and then pyrolyzed in an ammonia-containing atmosphere to produce the nitrogen-containing black glass (silicon oxycarbonitride).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nitrogen-containing ceramic 
material and ceramic fiber reinforced composites of such materials which 
can be used at temperatures which would destroy composites employing 
conventional polymeric materials. Matrix materials having enhanced performance have been 
suggested for use with fibers having high strength at elevated temperatures. 
Examples of such matrix materials are the glass and glass ceramics (Prewo 
et al., Ceramic Bulletin, Vol. 65, No. 2, 1986). In USSN 07/002,049 (corresponding to GB-A-2 266 303) a ceramic composition designated "black 
glass" is disclosed which has an empirical formula SiCxOy where x ranges 
from 0.5 to 2.0 and y ranges from 0.5 to 3.0, preferably 
x ranges from 0.9 to 1.6 and y ranges from 0.7 - 1.8. Such a ceramic 
material has a higher carbon content than prior art materials and is very 
resistant to high temperatures - up to about 1400°C. This black glass 
material is produced by reacting in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst 
a cyclosiloxane having a vinyl group with a cyclosiloxane having a hydrogen 
group to form a polymer, which is subsequently pyrolyzed to black glass. In US-A-4 460 638 a fiber-reinforced glass composite is 
disclosed which employs high modulus fibers in a matrix of a pyrolyzed 
silazane polymer. However, such materials are hydrolyzed, and since they 
release alcohols and contain excess water, they must be carefully dried to 
avoid fissures in the curing possess. US-A-No. 5 051 215 discloses the curing of preceramic 
polymers including polycarbosilanes, polysilanes, and polysilazanes by 
treating the polymers with nitrogen dioxide at temperatures up to 
300°C. The present invention relates to an improved black glass ceramic 
material produced by pyrolyzing the polycyclosiloxanes of USSN 07/002,049 (corresponding to GB-A-2 266 303)  
 
WO 90/12835 describes the use of hydridosiloxanes as precursors 
for such ceramic products as silica, silicon oxynitride, silicon 
carbide and metal silicates. The hydridosiloxanes can be 
pyrolyzed directly to form the ceramics, or they can be first 
reacted to introduce additional substituents on the silicon atoms, 
and then pyrolyzed. These additional substituents are introduced 
by reacting the hydridosiloxanes with such reactants as water, 
alcohols, phenols, amines, organometallic complexes, or alkenes, 
in the presence of a catalyst that will activate the hydrogen atoms 
of the hydridosiloxanes. The nature of the reactant determines the 
other elements additional
