<ABSTRACT>
The invention is comprised of a method which allows the 
user to convert several data layers from one GIS into another. 

The user creates a template map of the area of interest. The 
template is an "all points" map which, when graphed, would 

appear as a black polygon identical in shape to the area of 
interest. Using the first GIS, the template is converted to a 

file in bit-mapped format. All zero bits in this file are 
identified and their position in the file noted. This 

information is referred to as the transform function. For 
each data layer to be converted, the first GIS is used to 

display a map of the proper extent. This display is converted 
to a file in bit-mapped format and the transform function used 

to delete non-data bits which correspond to the zero bits 
identified in the template file. The resulting, modified, 

bit-map is imported into the second GIS.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computer aided 
geographic information systems (GIS). More particularly, this 
invention relates to an improved method of converting data 
from one GIS to another, maintaining a consistent system of 
georeferencing. A geographic information system is an information system 
designed to work with data referenced by spatial or geographic 
coordinates. For example, on a very basic level, a contour map 
of an area of land (that is, a map in which contour lines 
indicate the elevations at specific geographic points) could 
be considered a GIS. If, to the contour map, we added a 
street map, a sewer map, and an aerial photograph, then we 
would have a GIS composed of four data sets: each set being 
referred to as a data layer or data plane. In an automated GIS, the data layers will be stored in a 
data base system and a set of tools will be included to enter, 
manipulate and analyze the data, and then display the result 
either on a screen or as hardcopy printout. To create an automated GIS, it is necessary to first 
identify and gather data. Typical sources of such data are 
municipal maps, government survey maps, aerial photographs and 
other publicly available data sources. The data must be 
extracted from these sources and then be manipulated so that 
it may be entered into the GIS. In addition, the data must be 
georegistered or georeferenced. That is, the spatial data 
must be referenced to a coordinate system such as Universal 
Transverse Mercator, State Plane, or Latitude/Longitude.  The geo-registration process is mathematically as 
follows:

x = f₁(X,Y) y = f₂(X,Y) 


 
where 
(x,y) =distorted coordinates in some coordinate system, (X,Y) =correct coordinates in a selected reference grid f₁,f₂ =transformation functions  
   In its simplest form, where the distorted coordinates are 
taken from a scale drawing and the selected reference grid is 
a flat surface marked by latitude and longitude, the 
transformation functions are linear equations of the type: 
x = AX + BY + C  
, where A, B and C are constants. In the case 
of aerial photographs, where the intent is to represent the 
curved earth surface on a flat map, and where the angle of the 
photograph, as well as the photographs representation of a 
curved surface in a two dimensional plane must be taken into 
account, the transformations are considerably more complex but 
are well known in the art. The standard method by which data is georegistered 
against selected reference coordinates (i.e. of identifying

accuracy, said method comprising the steps of: 

a. selecting a geographic area, said area's boundary 
comprised of a plurality of line segments, each of said 

line segment being adjacent to two other of said line 
segments, and each line segment having two end points, 

each of said end point being shared with one of said
