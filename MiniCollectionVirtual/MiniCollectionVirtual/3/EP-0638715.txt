<ABSTRACT>
Heat is recovered from the combustion products of a 
gas turbine engine, bypassing an endothermic fuel 

through a heat exchanger (50) arranged in the exhaust 
section (44) of the gas turbine engine prior to burning 

the fuel in the combustion section of the engine. In 
one embodiment, the fuel is decomposed by a catalyst 

provided in a fuel flow path (66) of a second heat 
exchanger (64) heat being provided to said second heat 

exchanger by air bled from the compressor (22) of the 
engine. In another embodiment, fuel is decomposed in 

the heat exchanger (50) itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for managing the energy
produced by a gas turbine engine.One of the considerations in selection of gas turbine engine for
a particular application is the overall thermodynamic efficiency of the
engine. For aircraft operators such as commercial airlines,
thermodynamic efficiency is critical to operating the airline at a profit.
Military operators of aircraft are likewise concerned about thermodynamic
efficiency, since thermodynamic efficiency determines the effective range
of a particular aircraft.The thermodynamic efficiency of industrial gas turbines, such as
those used to generate electricity, directly affects the cost of operation
thereof. Lower thermodynamic efficiency results in higher costs to the
consumer, and/or lower profits to the electric power industry. Therefore,
there is an ongoing pursuit to increase the thermodynamic efficiency of
gas turbine engines.What is needed is a method of providing efficient energy
management of a gas turbine engine to yield a significant increase in the
overall thermodynamic efficiency thereof.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
method for increasing the overall thermodynamic efficiency of a gas
turbine engine. US-A-3018626 discloses a method of recovering
thermal energy from combustion products of a gas turbine
engine having the features of the preamble of claim 1
and a gas turbine engine having the features of the
preamble of claim 3.US-A-5161365 discloses an endothermic fuel power
generator.From a first aspect, the invention provides a
method of recovering thermal energy from combustion
products of a gas turbine engine, said engine having in
serial flow arrangement
a compressor section for compressing ambient air to
produce compressed air,a combustion section for mixing fuel with said
compressed air and igniting said fuel and compressed air
to produce said combustion products,a turbine section for expanding said combustion
products and driving the compressor section,an exhaust section for conveying said combustion
products from said turbine section and out of said gas
turbine engine; said method comprisingproviding a first heat exchanger located in said
exhaust section and exposed to said combustion products,
said heat exchanger having first and second flow paths
extending therethrough, each flow path having an inlet
and an outlet; andflowing said combustion products through the first
flow path of said first heat exchanger;characterised by further providing a combustible
endothermic fuel
