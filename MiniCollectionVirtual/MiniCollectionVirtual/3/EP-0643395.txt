<ABSTRACT>
A capacitor having a high dielectric constant and method 
of making the same is disclosed. The capacitor (10) 

comprises a bottom electrode (12) comprising a conductive 
oxide layer deposited upon a substrate (110) by chemical 

vapor deposition. A dielectric layer (14) having a high 
dielectric constant is deposited upon the conductive oxide. 

Lastly, a counter electrode (16) is formed upon the 
dielectric layer. The dielectric material is selected in the 

group consisting of:
 

tantalum oxide (Ta₂O₂), strontium titanium oxide (SrTiO₃), and 
barium titanium oxide (BaTiO₃).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to semiconductor 
memory devices, and more particularly, to storage capacitors 
for use in semiconductor memory devices. Capacitors comprising silicon dioxide (SiO₂) are 
typically used in conventional dynamic random access memories 
(DRAMs). To achieve greater charge storage density for 
increasingly dense, next generation very large scale 
integrated circuits (VLSI), the SiO₂ capacitors must likewise 
decrease in size. Silicon dioxide capacitors have a limited 
charge storage density, however, and in order to achieve 
adequate charge storage within an acceptable cell size, 
complex processes are needed to fabricate trench or stacked 
capacitors. The complexity arises in part due to the large 
trench depths or stacked capacitor heights needed to provide 
adequate surface area for charge storage. Thus, for the one-transistor 
memory cell concept to be viable for use in next 
generation 64- and 256-Mbit DRAMs, high dielectric constant 
(εr) materials may be needed. Use of such high dielectric 
constant materials will more easily allow a greater charge 
density in the storage capacitor, reduce the trench depth or 
capacitor height, and thereby simplify the capacitor 
fabrication process. Examples of high dielectric constant (εr) materials for 
potential use in future DRAMs include insulators such as 
tantalum oxide (Ta₂O₅), strontium titanium oxide (SrTiO₃), and  
 
barium titanium oxide (BaTiO₃). In order to achieve the 
stoichiometry and density required for a high dielectric 
constant with these insulators, the insulators must be 
annealed at high temperatures (typically, greater than 
800 °C) in oxygen after deposition of the same. As a result 
of the high temperature anneal in an oxygen ambient and 
subsequent processing, underlying electrode materials, such 
as polysilicon, can also be oxidized. Oxidation of the 
underlying electrode materials degrades the performance of 
the resultant capacitor structure, thereby lowering the 
capacitance thereof. In the article, "A STACKED CAPACITOR WITH (BaxSr1-x)TiO₃ 
FOR 256M DRAM" by K. Koyama et al., IEDM Tech. Dig., 1991, 
pp. 823-826, a method of forming a stacked capacitor is 
disclosed in which platinum (Pt) is used as an electrode 
material for its oxidation resistance during RF-magnetron 
sputter deposition of the dielectric layer (Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO₃. 
In addition, a tantalum (Ta) film is placed under the Pt 
layer to prevent silicon (Si) diffusion into the Pt at a 
contact area. Thus, a Pt/Ta double layer is
