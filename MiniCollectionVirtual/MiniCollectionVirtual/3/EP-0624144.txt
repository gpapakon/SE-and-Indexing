<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of automatically sorting sheet-like objects
into bundled groups, in which the objects are advanced in rows. The invention is
intended for application when sorting, among other things, computer printouts, both
in a folded and non-folded state, envelopes, so-called mailers, etc.The invention also relates to arrangement for carrying out the method.Methods and arrangement of this general kind are known to the art. According to
one known technique, the objects are delivered to a row of mutually sequential
bundling or stacking stations, in which the objects are bundled on a raisable and
lowerable bottom device at respective locations, and wherein bundled objects are
placed on conveyors which move along the rows of bundling stations and later removed
therefrom. This known technique is encumbered with a number of serious
draw-backs. For instance, the arrangement of rows of bundling stations and a conveyor
which is common to all said stations places serious restrictions on the speed at
which the objects can be sorted, while requiring the use of an intricate control system.EP-A-0 352 374 and WO 91/08974 discloses technique according to which bundles
are formed by adding each new object on top of preceding, stationary objects, which
calls for vertically movable bundle platforms. This extends the system vertically and
reduces the flexibility of choice and change of bundle size.Previously known is also technique according to GB-A-1 424 182 and GB-A-2
025 372. However, such technique does not involve the problem of arranging objects
in bundles using a grouping device temporarily halting the flow of objects in
order to create a gap, which devides the objects for two successive bundles. The present invention provides a method and an arrangement which enables the objects
to be sorted very quickly and which include significant simplifications in comparison
with the known methods and arrangements of the kind meant here.Thus, the invention relates to a method of sorting sheet-like objects into bundled
groups, in which the 
objects are advanced in rows. The objects are arranged
in a fishscale-like configuration in which each
object is partially overlapped by an immediately preceding
object, as seen in the direction of advancement,
the objects being stacked together from beneath.The invention also relates to an arrangement for sorting
sheet-like objects into bundled groups which include
conveyor means for advancing the objects in rows.The arrangement comprises devices which

<CLAIMS>
A method for sorting sheet-like objects into groups to form bundles or stacks (2,
2'), in which the objects are advanced in rows and then arranged in a fishscale-like

configuration, 
characterized
 by halting a flow of, in a fishscale-like configuration,
partially overlapping objects, in which a following object is partially inserted beneath

a respective preceding object as seen in the direction of advancement, by
means of a grouping device (23), such as to interrupt the flow of objects, this interruption

mutually separating two mutually sequential groups of objects, prior to halting
the stream of mutually overlapping objects of a group with the aid of a stacking

device (18), and forming said bundle or stack (2, 2') of objects by continuously inserting the
objects of the group beneath preceding stationary objects, to form said bundle or stack.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 by passing the row of objects
through a lifting device (12, 13) which functions to hold the rear part (11) of respective

objects in a raised position while the next following object is inserted partially
beneath the lifted part of the immediately preceding object.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 by releasing a bundle (2,
2') containing a predetermined number of objects through the agency of the stacking

device, and transporting said bundle away.
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 by detecting the last object
(1') that the grouping device allows to pass through prior to an interruption,

wherein the stream of objects is released by means of the grouping device when said
last object has passed a predetermined position between the stacking device and the

grouping device; and by releasing the bundle (2') in which said object forms the
bottommost object, through the agency of the stacking device, whereafter the object

stream is again halted by means of the stacking device. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized
 by activating the
grouping device to cause an interruption in the object stream in response to a signal

delivered by a sign reader (27) which is located upstream of the grouping device and
which functions to detect the nature of the objects in the object stream and/or count

said objects (1), and/or delivered by a height detector (28) which functions to detect
the height of a bundle formed in the vincinity of the stacking device.
A method according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterized
