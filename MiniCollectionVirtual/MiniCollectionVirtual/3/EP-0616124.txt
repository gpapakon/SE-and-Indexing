<ABSTRACT>
The seal has a metallic carrier layer, with passages in the area of engine combustion chambers, and with cooling and lubrication passages. It also has metallic sealing layers above and below the carrier layer, to seal combustion chambers and cooling/lubrication passages. The sealing layers consist mainly of numerous web and ring elements, which are formed by metal plate. The elements are formed along closed lines, and are arranged, so that they enclose all passages. All elements are connected to each other, and thereby form one-piece sealing layers.

<CLAIMS>
Multilayer metal gasket (56), free from soft-material
layers, for combustion engines with a metal support layer

(58), which shows holes in the area of the engine
combustion chambers and coolant and lubricant passages and

with a metal sealing layer (60, 64) arranged above and
below the support layer (58) for sealing the combustion

chambers and the coolant and lubricant passages (61, 63,
68, 69), whereby essentially the sealing layers (60, 64)

comprise a number of sheet-metal linking and ring elements
(65, 65', 66, 70) which are linked together to form

single-piece sealing layers which are formed along closed
loop lines and arranged such that they surround the holes

for the combustion chambers and the coolant and lubricant
passages (61, 63, 68, 69), whereby combustion chamber

surrounds (62) are formed together with the sealing layers
(60, 64) and whereby the support layer (58) and/or the

sealing layers (60, 64) are, where necessary, coated on at
least one side with elastomer film.
Multilayer metal gasket according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the combustion chamber surround (62)

around the edge of the support layer (58) is flanged on
the combustion chamber side.
Mulilayer metal gasket according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the edge of the combustion chamber seal on the

combustion chamber side is flush with the corresponding 
edge of the support layer (58) and forms a sandwich

structure open towards the combustion chamber.
Multilayer metal gasket according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the sealing layers (60, 64) are

beaded along the lines surrounding the holes for the
combustion chambers and the coolant and lubricant

passages.
Multilayer metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the support layer (58) and/or the

sealing layers (60, 64) are coated on at least one side
with elast
omer film such that, in the case of a gasket
comprised of a support layer (58) and various sealing

layers (60, 64), at least one coat of elastomer film is
arranged between the individual layers in each case.
Multilayer metal gasket according to one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the individual layers are

linked together in those areas where no seal is created
and where no compression occurs when installed.
Multilayer metal gasket according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the layers are linked together by

means of through joints.
