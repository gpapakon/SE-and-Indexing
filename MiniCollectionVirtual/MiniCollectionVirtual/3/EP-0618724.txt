<ABSTRACT>
A digital signal recording and reproducing apparatus are disclosed which can 
record digital data of the ATV system or some other digital data onto a recording 

medium without the necessity of displacing recording areas for sub codes and so forth 
of the recording medium (9) and can thus make effective use of the recording capacity 

of the recording medium. When an ordinary television signal is to be recorded, the 
length of IBG and amble areas between an audio signal recording area and a video 

signal recording area is set to an integral number of times the length of a synchronizing 

block of a digital audio signal and a digital video signal. When data of the ATV system 
or like data are to be recorded, the data are recorded continuously from the audio signal 

recording area to the video signal recording area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for recording and reproducing a digital 
signal such as a digital video signal or a digital audio signal onto and from a track of a 
recording medium. An apparatus has been proposed and is disclosed, for example, in EP 0,553,650 
A1 wherein an oblique track is formed on a magnetic tape wrapped around a rotary 
drum and a digital signal such as a digital video signal or a digital audio signal is 
recorded and reproduced in a time divisional relationship onto or from a sectioned area 
of the track by means of a rotary head. FIG. 3 shows a construction of an exemplary one of conventional digital signal 
recording and reproducing apparatus of the type mentioned. Referring to FIG. 3, the 
digital signal recording and reproducing apparatus shown includes a recording 
processing circuit 1 to which a brightness signal Y and a pair of color difference signals 
PR and PB which constitute analog component video signals are inputted. The signals 
are processed by various processes including analog to digital conversion, blocking, 
shuffling, DCT(discrete cosine transform), compression by quantization and variable 
length coding, and framing by the recording processing circuit 1, and then supplied to a 
parity generation circuit 3. The parity generation circuit 3 adds a parity of the product code construction to 
the data supplied thereto, and the resulted data from the parity generation circuit 3 are 
supplied to a SYNC and ID generation circuit 4, by which a synchronizing code and an 
ID are added to the data. The data from the SYNC and ID generation circuit 4 are 
processed by parallel to serial conversion and conversion into recording codes by a  
 
channel encoder 5 and are then amplified by an amplifier 6, whereafter they are 
supplied to a magnetic head 8 by way of a recording side terminal R of a switching 
circuit 7 so that they are recorded onto a magnetic tape 9. Here, a digital video signal 
for one frame is recorded as a plurality of(for example, 10 in the NTSC system, 12 in 
the PAL system and 20 in the HDTV system) oblique tracks. It is to be noted that, though not shown, a digital audio signal, a sub code signal 
and an ATF pilot signal are supplied to the channel encoder 5 and recorded in a time 
divisional relationship with the digital video signal onto each track on the magnetic tape 
9 by the magnetic head 8. Upon reproduction, data reproduced from the magnetic tape 9 by the magnetic 
head 8 are supplied by way of a terminal P of the switching circuit 7 on

A digital magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus which converts an 
input digital image signal into high efficiency codes and further into variable length 

codes and then records the thus obtained variable length codes, comprising: 
   buffering means (17) for reducing the amount of data of the variable length 

coding output for a predetermined period shorter than one flame period to an amount 
smaller than an aimed value and quantizing the image data converted into the high 

frequency codes with a particular quantization step; 
   synchronising block conversion means (18) for converting the variable length 

coding output for the predetermined period into a construction of synchronising blocks 
defining the data area length of the synchronizing blocks so that the variable length 

coding output for the predetermined period whose data amount has been controlled by 
said buffering means (17) may be included in an integral number of synchronizing 

blocks; 
   information addition means (4) for adding information of the quantization step 

for each of the synchronizing blocks; and 
   control means for recording an integral number of units of the image data 

quantized by said buffering means onto a track of a recording medium and recording or 
reproducing a plurality of different digital signals having a same synchronizing block 

length in a spaced relationship from each other by a distance equal to an integral 
number of times the synchronising block length on the track of the recording medium. 
A digital magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to 
claim 1, wherein the plurality of different digital signals include an audio signal and a 

video signal. 
A digital magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to 
claim 2, wherein the synchronising blocks are provided between the audio signal and 

the video signal. 
A digital magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to 
claim 3, wherein the synchronising blocks are provided at each of the beginnings and 

the ends of the audio signal and the video signal. 
A digital magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to 
claim 4, wherein sub codes are recor
ded at the end of the video signal and same 
synchronizing blocks as the synchronizing block are provided at the end of the sub 

codes.
