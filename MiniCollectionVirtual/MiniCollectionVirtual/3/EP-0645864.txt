<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for sealing cable sleeves for joining and/or branching (junctions) of power and telecommunications cables, and to a cable sleeve for carrying out the process having at least one sealing space (8) in which the cables (10) which are to be connected or which branch off are joined together by means of their connecting elements (19) in at least one sealing space (8) which is formed in the cable sleeve (18) and is closed off apart from a filling opening which can be closed, and which is filled through the filling opening (28) with a filling, which fills it completely and consists of spherical or rod-shaped granulated and compressible sealing bodies (9), and this filling (17) is then compressed by exertion of mechanical pressure using a pressure force which is sufficient to deform the sealing bodies (9) elastically, so that the sealing bodies (9) form a virtually homogeneous sealing mass which fills the sealing space (8), and such that the sealing space (8) is then closed off while the pressure force is maintained.

Process for sealing cable sleeves for joining and/or 
branching of power and telecommunications cables with 

at least one tight or sleeve compartment (8, 40) in which the 
cables (10) to be joined or branched meet their connectors (19) 

and, on this occasion, the tight compartment (8) formed within 
the sleeve body (18) is sealed, except for a locking feed 

opening,
 
characterized in that 


a) by means of the feed opening, the tight compartment (8) 
is fed with a charge of granulated and compressible 

sealers (9) having the shape of balls or bars, and then 
b) this charge (17) is compressed by exerting a mechanical 
pressure of which the force will be sufficient for the 

strain to the sealers (9) so that the latter will form an 
almost homogenous proofing compound which fills up the 

tight compartment (8), and then  
 
c) the tight compartment (8) will be sealed and the force of 
pressure maintained. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the cables (10) meeting in at least one tight compartment 

(8) formed within the cable sleeve (18) will, on all sides, be 
surrounded by the charge of sealers (9). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the cables (10) to be linked will meet their connectors 

in a sleeve compartment (40) separated in front of the single 

or the several tight compartments (8) and, further, that the 
only or several tight compartments (8) have been filled with 

sealers (9) which will be put and maintained under pressure. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealers (9) consist of an elastomer with a Shore hardness 

between A 40 and A 80. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the sealers (9) have a Shore hardness of A 50. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealers (9) show a diameter and/or a length between 0, 5 

and 5, 0 mm.  
 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealers (9) are compressed to approx. 60 to 80% by 

volume. 
Cable sleeve for joining and/or branching of power and 
telecommunications cables, especially for cable fittings, 

comprising an external bushing, in one cylindric part or 
longitudinally split, to apply the process according to at least 

one of the claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that
 
the external or main bushing (1, 21) has, at least at one end, 

been provided with a removable screw-in or head bush (7, 22) 
to close the tight compartment (8) filled with sealers (9), and 

this bush can be mounted on the external or main bushing 
(1, 21) by inserting some packing elements (3, 25, 27) of a 

material showing elasticity of extension and by exerting pressure 
to the charge of compressible, spherical or bar-shaped 

sealers (9). 
Cable sleeve according to claim 8, characterized in that 
the cylindrical external bushing (1), longitudinally split 

and held together by means of some straining rings (5), shows, 
at the side of the cable outlet, a collar (2) as a buttress for 

at least one packing ring (3) of a material having elasticity of 
extension and, at the side of the cable inlet, an internal screw 

thread (4) into which a screw-in bush (7) can be screwed by 
means of its external thread (6), this bush being provided with 

the cable inlet opening allows to compress a charge of granulated 
sperical or bar-shaped sealers (9) which entirely fills  

 
the tight compartment (8) and hermetically encloses the single 

or the several cables (10) from all sides. 
Cable sleeve according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the screw-in bush (7) has longitudinally been split and 

can be tightened from outside using tension elements (12). 
Cable sleeve according to claim 8, characterized in that 
it shows a tight compartment (8), enclosed on all sides 

by the main bushing (21) and the head bushing (22), which can 
be filled with a charge of compressible spherical or bar-shaped 

sealers (9) to hermetically surround the single or the several 
cables (10) allover, sealers being granulated. 
Cable sleeve according to claim 11, characterized in 
that between main bushing (21) and head bushing (22), a 

compressible and strainable packing (27), duly adjusted to the 
cross-section of the bushing, has been provided and will space 

the two bushings in the released state. 
Cable sleeve according to claim 8, characterized in that 
it comprises a cylindrical external bushing (41) and, at 

one or both ends, a detachable head bushing (22) with a partition 
(26) and, at least, one each packing (16) by which at least 

one tight compartment has been formed, filled with sealers (9) 
and separated from the sleeve compartment (40) not containing 

any sealers (9).  
 
Cable sleeve according to one or more of the claims 
8 and 11 to 13, characterized in that 

within the walls of the main and head bushing (21, 22), at least
