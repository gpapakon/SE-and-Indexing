<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with polymeric dispersants, e.g. containing
sulfonated moieties, for aqueous dispersions of ceramic materials.Ceramic materials are often used to prepare lightweight, strong, thermally and
chemically resistant products. Because of the difficulties associated with the handling of
solid materials, it is desirable to be able to handle them as an aqueous dispersion of
ceramic materials. Dispersions of ceramic materials are fairly unstable as shown by the
formation of sediment upon standing, thereby rendering the dispersion nonhomogeneous,
difficult to use and potentially damaging to piping, pumps, and other
dispersion handling mechanical equipment.US-A-4,450,013 to Hirsch et al., discloses the use of copolymers of acrylic or
methacrylic acid and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid as a grinding or
dispersing agent for pigments. The pigments include chalk, clay, satin white, titanium
dioxide, kaolin and dolomite.We have now found certain polymeric dispersants which result in improved
dispersion of ceramic materials.According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous dispersion of
ceramic material which comprises:
(a) water;(b) from 0.1 to 99 percent by weight of the dispersion of one or more ceramic
materials selected from the group consisting of silicon, silicon carbide, silicon
nitride, sialon, aluminum nitride, boron nitride, boron carbide, yttria, zirconia
and alumina;(c) from 0.01 to 10 percent by weight, based on the weight of the one or more
ceramic materials, of one or more polymeric dispersants comprising, as
polymerized units; 
(i) from 20 to less than 95 percent by weight of one or more
carboxylic acid monomers selected from the group consisting of C3-C6
monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, C4-C8
monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides of C4-C8
monoethylenically unsaturated cis-dicarboxylic acids and the alkali
metal and ammonium salts thereof;(ii) from 5 to less than 80 percent by weight of one or more
monomers selected from the group consisting of sulphonic acid
monomers, phosphonic acid monomers and salts thereof; and(iii) N-tertiarybutylacrylamide up to 100 percent by weight of (i), (ii)
and (iii).The present invention also provides a method of preparing an aqueous dispersion by
forming a mixture of components (a), (b) and ( c), and agitating the mixture to form an
aqueous dispersion. The present invention further provides a method of improving the stability of
an aqueous dispersion of one or more ceramic
