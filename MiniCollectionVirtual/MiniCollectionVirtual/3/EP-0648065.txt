<ABSTRACT>
A food products support applicable to roast in microwave 
ovens, specially used for roasting potatoes and foods of similar 

size in microwave ovens, characterized in that it is constituted 
starting from a body (2) made of a resistant and rigid plastic 

material having a general configuration of a solid cylinder, which 
has, on its lower side, a perimetric oversize (9), and then a 

perceptible narrowing, destined to be incorporated, through a 
center circular perforation, to a part (4) having a straight configuration 

on its center portion and angular on its sidways emerging 
ends, being affixed to the rod (2) by means of a second 

part (5) with an identical shape, and having, on its center portion, 
a hollow cylindrical bed inserted into the emerging rod of 

the part (2), the parts (4) and (5) being retained in the oversize 
(9), and allowing for the side hinge and motion of same in 

their hinge point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to an Utility Model referring 
to a food products support applicable to roast in microwave ovens, 
the evident purpose of which is to constitute a supporting element 
for certain food products, such as potatoes or other foodstuffs 
of similar size in solid state, which are placed on spikes emerging 
from a lower hinged surface, for subjecting same to the action 
of a microwave oven, and the support is taken out through a lower 
part, and the roasted products are served directly. This invention applies to the industry devoted to the manufacture 
of household utensils and kitchen equipment. The food products support applicable to roast in microwave ovens 
as proposed by the invention constitutes per se an evident solution 
of the present problems in this matter, since starting of same it 
is possible, in a total and absolute way, to roast potatoes and similar 
food products, or different products with a similar size, in 
an oven, these foodstuffs maintaining always their particular - 
properties, and being it possible that the product be perfectly 
roasted at all its sides, obviating in a specific manner the existence 
of portions not roasted upon depositing the product on dishes 
or trays as it was the case up till now. In a more specific manner, the food products support applicable  
 
to roast in microwave ovens is determined starting from two parts 
made of a rigid plastic material, these two parts being joined 
one other by means of a hinge formed on the lower part, and supported 
by a third part consisting of a vertically emerging rod 
acting as a bonding element of the two parts supporting the foods 
and, at the same time, as a grasping handle. The hinged parts, horizontally placed and adopting an angular 
shape at its ends and practically straight on its middle portion, 
have a series of perforations made on its surface, these 
perforations receiving parts emerging through the upper side and 
having a sharp-pointed configuration, while on the lower side 
these parts adopt a blunt configuration and act as a base or 
support for the assembly The foods are driven in the emerging sharp-pointed elements, 
the whole being deposited within a microwave oven, specifically 
on an acting tray, the parts emerging from the lower part acting 
as legs or feet. Once the cooking or roasting of the products has been carried 
out, the whole is taken from the oven and grasped by the upper 
portion of the emerging rod which acts as a handle, and deposited 
on the table where the lunch

1.- A food products support applicable to roast in microwave 
ovens, specially used for roasting potatoes and foods of similar 

size in microwave ovens, characterized in that it is constituted 
starting from a body (2) made of a resistant and rigid plastic 

material having a general configuration of a solid cylinder, which 
has, on its lower side, a perimetric oversize (9), and then a 

perceptible narrowing, destined to be incorporated, through a 
center circular perforation, to a part (4) having a straight configuration 

on its center portion and angular on its sidways emerging 
ends, being affixed to the rod (2) by means of a second - 

part (5) with an identical shape, and having, on its center portion, 
a hollow cylindrical bed inserted into the emerging rod of 

the part (2), the parts (4) and (5) being retained in the over-size 
(9), and allowing for the side hinge and motion of same in 

their hinge point. 
2.- A food products support applicable to roast in microwave 
ovens, according claim 1, characterized in that the parts (4) and 

(5), made of a resistant and rigid plastic material as the part 
(2), have, on their emerging ends on the upper portion, several 

sharp-pointed protuberances (7), while, on the lower part, the 
cylindrical protuberances (7) emerge as supporting points (8), 

being fitted with a blunt configuration on their lower portion. 
3.- A food products support applicable to roast in microwave 
ovens, according to the preceding claims, characterized in that 

the vertical cylindrical element (2) has, on its upper portion, 
a stepping reducing next markedly its size, and having, on the 

upper portion a cylindrical shaped handle adopting an oblong 
configuration having an opening at its center portion.
