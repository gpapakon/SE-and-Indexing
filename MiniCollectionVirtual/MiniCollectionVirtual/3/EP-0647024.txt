<ABSTRACT>
An attenuator circuit (20) which has a small insertion loss and also has a broad 
tolerance toward the fluctuation of the element parameter. An attenuator stage (10C) 

having the largest attenuation quantity of a plurality of attenuator stages is formed with a 
π-type attenuator stage, and an attenuator stage (10A) having the smallest attenuation 

quantity of the plurality of attenuator stages is formed with a T-type attenuator stage. In 
this way, an attenuator stage having a large attenuation quantity whose precision of the 

attenuation quantity is apt to be detracted is formed of a π-type attenuator stage so that 
the precision becomes high, further, an attenuator stage having a small attenuation 

quantity is formed of a T-type attenuator stage so that the insertion loss can be lowered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an attenuator circuit apparatus, and more particularly to
an improvement of a step attenuator circuit for attenuating in stages a signal such as a
high frequency signal of a micro-wave band.Up to the present time, various step attenuators have been proposed to obtain an
attenuated signal of plural bits with respect to a high frequency signal. Especially, when
it is applied to a consumer's appliance (for instance, a portable telephone), an essential
condition is that it can be manufactured at a low price and into a small size among these.
For this, recently, a MMIC (Monolithic Microwave IC) attenuator which utilizes a GaAs
FET (field effect transistor) is being developed actively.These step attenuators can be divided roughly into two categories. One of them
is the step attenuator in which plural stages of a π-type attenuator circuit are connected
in series with respect to the signal path as shown in Fig. 1 ("FAST GaAs MMIC
ATTENUATOR HAS 5-b RESOLUTION", MICROWAVE & RF OCTOBER 1991
pp.71-76). The other is the step attenuator in which plural stages of a T-type attenuator
circuit are connected in series with respect to the signal path as shown in Fig. 2 ("DC-12[GHz]
4-Bit GaAs Monolithic Digital Attenuator", Applied Microwave Winter 91/92
pp.60-67).Thus, the step attenuator is usually composed of the π-type attenuator circuits or
the T-type attenuator circuits. In the case of a π-type attenuator circuit, there is a
disadvantage that the insertion loss of it is larger in some degree (4[dB] or more, at DC-10[GHz]).
This is mainly due to the increasing of the insertion loss which is caused by
the electric power which leaks from these FETs, in view of the fact that there are two
FETs connected in the shunt position with respect to the signal path. Therefore, this type
is not suited for the realization of the step attenuator of plural bits, which is required to
have lower insertion loss.On the other hand, in the case of the T-type attenuator circuit, the number of the
FET which is connected in the shunt position with respect to the signal path is one. It is
less by one than the number of FETs in the case of the π-type attenuator circuit,
therefore, the insertion loss can be restrained to a considerably small value (2[dB] or less,
at DC-2[GHz]). Consequently, this type is suited for the realization of the step
attenuator of plural bits, which is required to have lower insertion loss. However, in the case of the T-type attenuator circuit, there was a problem that
the more the attenuation
