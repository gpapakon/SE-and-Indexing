<ABSTRACT>
A method for prophylactically or therapeutically treating sepsis or septic shock is described, wherein an inhibitor to tissue factor is administered to septic patients. Additionally, a method for treating inflammation is described wherein the inhibitor is administered to patients. This inhibitor is termed lipoprotein associated coagulation inhibitor, or commonly LACI. It is 38 kD and has 276 amino acids. LACI has now been shown to be useful for the treatment of sepsis, septic shock and inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides the use of lipoprotein associated coagulation
inhibitor (LACI) in the manufacture of a medicament
for prophylactically and therapeutically
treating acute and chronic inflammation, sepsis and septic shock.Sepsis and its sequela septic shock remain among the most dreaded
complications after surgery and in critically ill patients. The Center for Disease
Control ranks septicemia as the 13th leading cause of death in the United States
(see MMWR, 1987, 39:31 and US Dept. of Health and Human Services, 37:7,
1989), and the 10th leading cause of death among elderly Americans (see MMWR,
1987, 39:777). The incidence of these disorders is increasing, and mortality
remains high. Estimates of the total cost of caring for patients with septicemia
range from $5 billion to $10 billion annually (see MMWR, 1987, 39:31). Death
can occur in 40% to 60% of the patients. This percentage has not seen any
improvement over the past 20 years.The incidence of blood borne gram-positive and gram-negative infections
that can lead to septic shock occur approximately equally. Septic shock is
characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion, leading to insufficient oxygen supply
to tissues, hypotension and oliguria. Septic shock occurs because bacterial
products, principally LPS, react with cell membranes and components of the
coagulation, complement, fibrinolytic, bradykinin and immune systems to activate
coagulation, injure cells and alter blood flow, especially in the microvasculature.
Microorganisms frequently activate the classic complement pathway, and
endotoxin activates the alternate pathway. Complement activation, leukotriene
generation and the direct effects of endotoxin on neutrophils lead to accumulation
of these inflammatory cells in the lungs, release of the enzymes and production of
toxic oxygen radicals which damage the pulmonary endothelium and initiate the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a major cause of death in 
patients with septic shock and is characterized by pulmonary congestion,
granulocyte aggregation, hemorrhage and capillary thrombi.Activation of the coagulation system results in thrombin generation and
platelet thrombi formation in the microcirculation of many tissues. The
pathogenesis of this syndrome involves the activation of the intrinsic coagulation
system by Factor XII, as well as activation of the extrinsic pathway through
upregulation of tissue factor. Activated Factor XII initiates the intrinsic
coagulation cascade and eventually fibrinogen is converted
