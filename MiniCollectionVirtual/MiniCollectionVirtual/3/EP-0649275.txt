<ABSTRACT>
A fungicide for wood preservation contains as active component a mixture of a triazole compound, preferably propiconazole (1-((2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolane2-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole) and a boric acid ester selected from trihexyleneglycol biborate and compounds having the general formula (I): B-(O-R)3 or general formula (II) in which formulae R is an aliphatic group having 1-18 C-atoms or an aromatic group, the triazole compound and the boric acid ester forming a mixing ratio between 1:1 and 1:20, preferably between 1:2 and 1:10. Such a fungicide exhibits a surprising synergistic effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a fungicide which is
characterized in that as active component it contains a
mixture of a triazole compound and a boric acid ester
selected from trihexyleneglycol biborate and compounds
having the general formula
B-(O-R)3 
or the general formula

in which formulae R is an aliphatic group having 1-18 C-atoms
or an aromatic group, the triazole compound and the
boric acid ester forming a mixing ratio between 1:1 and
1:20, preferably between 1:2 and 1:10. The fungicide
according to the invention exhibits a surprising
synergistic effect.Preferably the fungicide according to the invention
contains as active component a mixture consisting of
propiconazole (1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole)
and a boric acid
ester, preferably Borester-7 (trihexyleneglycol biborate).
Such a mixture has a wood-preserving effect which is far
better than the expected, purely additive effect.Propiconazole, which has the structural formula 

is a clear, pale or vivid yellow, very viscous liquid,
which during recent years has gained a footing as wood
preservative. The compound is a systemic fungicide with a
broad activity spectrum. It is i.a. used within agriculture
for controlling diseases in grain varieties caused by
Erysiphe graminis, Leptosphaeria norodum, Pseudocerosporella
herpotrichoides, Pyrenophora teres and Rhynchosporium
secalis, and it is also used in certain localities
for combating Uncinula necator on grapes.Within the field of wood preservation the compound has
partly been used per se (cf. Alex Valcke: "Suitability of
Propiconazole (R 49362) as a new-generation wood-preserving
fungicide", The International Research Group on Wood
Preservation", presented March 1989 at the annual meeting
in Lappeenrauta, Finland), and partly been used in mixtures
with other fungicides. The compound in pure form for
protection of wood and coatings against microorganisms has
been described in DK published application No. 163 805.
Mixtures of propiconazole with other fungicidally and
insecticidally active compounds are i.a. known from EP
published specifications No. 413 909 and No. 458 060 which
concern fungicidal mixtures of propiconazole with
pyrethroides and carbamates, respectively.As mentioned propiconazole is the preferred triazole-constituent
in the fungicide according to the invention, 
but it is quite feasible to replace propiconazole wholly
or partly by other triazoles which are effective against
wood destroying fungi. An example of such a triazole
compound
