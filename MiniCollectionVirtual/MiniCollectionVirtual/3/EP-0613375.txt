<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to peptide
pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof, in
particular, peptides including the amino acid
sequence, -L-Glx-L-Glx-L-Lys-. These peptide
compositions are useful in the treatment of
immunodepressed states and of opportunistic
infections in immunodepressed states associated with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.The present invention is based in part on the
discovery that certain peptide compositions, in
particular pentapeptides, exhibit a broad range of
efficacy for the prevention and treatment of
opportunistic infections in immunodepressed states,
and for therapeutically effective treatment of
immunodeficient states, particularly AIDS. This is
believed to be highly unexpected for such relatively
small compounds to exhibit such a broad range of
activity. Furthermore, we have not found any
significant side effects from the use of the peptides
according to the present invention. Due to their
simple nature, the peptides of the present invention
are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. EP0164654 describes the manufacture of medicaments
containing peptides for the treatment of viral or
fungoidal immune deficiencies, chronical infects,
autoimmune diseases and for the therapy of diseases
caused by cells which contains immunological relevant
changes of membranes.GB1363801 describes the manufacture of substantially pure
peptides which can be administered by injection or by
absorption through mucous membranes, useful for inducing
hormone release especially growth hormone.US4,395,404 discloses several peptide factors present in
the thymus gland which have been implicated to play
important roles in the development and maintenance of
immunological competence in man and in animals.Chemical Abstracts, vol 111, no. 7, abstract no. 55230r
discloses a peptide (Thr-Pro-Glu-Glu-Lys) for the
stimulation of conformation of haemoglobin-fragments.Chemical Abstracts, vol. 82. no. 11, abstract no. 73454c
discloses the synthesis of a porcine growth hormone-releasing
hormone and the N-terminal decapeptide of the
β-chain of human haemoglobin. As used herein, the terms "immunomodulator" and
"immunomodulating" encompass the activity of
enhancing or restoring the subject's immune system,
as evidenced by measurable blood parameters and/or
the patient's improved ability to combat infection or
disease, and the ability to heal tissue. Hence,
immunomodulation encompasses improvement of the
immune system due to an immunodeficient state (for
example, caused by removal of the thymus), and/or
