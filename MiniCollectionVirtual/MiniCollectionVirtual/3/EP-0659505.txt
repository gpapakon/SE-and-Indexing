<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a supporting and weighing device for a casting ladle (18) on a supporting frame (15) of a transfer device. The two levers (1) are, on the one hand, rotatably mounted in a bearing (3) of a bearing pedestal (2) and, on the other hand, are supported on a damping cylinder (4) and a return spring (6). In the loaded condition, the ladle-supporting elements (19) rest on the supporting feet (1a) in the supporting hollow (10) and said feet in turn, are supported on the bearing surfaces (12) of the balance beam (11) of the weighing elements (17). For the purpose of load damping, hydraulically acting damping cylinders (4) are provided and the levers (1) come to rest in a retarded manner on the bearing surfaces (12) of the balance beam (11), without a shock. The bearing pedestal (2) is here part of the supporting frame (15).

<CLAIMS>
Supporting and weighing device at support frame of a transport device for
ladies with levers being mounted to a support frame as slewing around a

horizontal axis having inclined supports and guide surfaces
for the ladle bearing elements

distinguishing by

levers (1) with bearings (3) facing each other and being hinged at the
extreme ends of the support frame (15) on outside mounted pillow blocks

(2), by reset springs (6) being arranged between the support frame (15)
and the levers (1), by shock absorbing cylinders (4) being arranged

between the support frame (15) and the levers (1) and by every lever (1)
having one support toe (1a) to rest on the bearing surface (12) of the

weighing device (16) which is composed of the weighing beams (11) and
weighing elements (17).
Supporting and weighing device according to Claim 1,

distinguishing by having levers (1) which return into an upright position in
unloaded condition without having any reset springs (6) which is caused by

the center of gravity of the levers (1) being on the off their bearings (3).
Supporting and weighing device at the support frame of a transport device
for ladies with levers mounted slewably around a horizontal axis with

inclined supports and guiding surfaces for the ladle bearing elements,

distinguishing by having levers (1) facing each other and mounted to the
extreme ends of the weighing beam (11), by the overall center of gravity of

the levers (1) being on the outside of their bearings (3), by the lever (1) in
unloaded condition resting on pillow blocks (20) which are part of the

support frame (15), by shock absorbing cylinders (4) being arranged
between the support frame (15) and the levers (1) and by every lever (1)

having one support toe (1a) to rest on the bearing surface (12) of the
weighing beam (11).
