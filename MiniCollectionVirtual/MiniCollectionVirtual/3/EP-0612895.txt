<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an opening roof system, especially for a veranda or glass roof, of the sort including at least one span which extends as a slope from an upper edge section fixed to a wall or the like as far as a lower edge section forming a ground beam (sill) or support, this span being fixed to these sections, and which is delimited laterally by sections forming rafters and which comprises at least one removable panel which can slide in the direction of the slope of the roof. This system is characterised in that each moving panel (9) is provided with rolling members (30) interacting with runways which are formed on the said sections which form rafters (25). Application to glass roofs and to verandas.

<CLAIMS>
An opening roof system, in particular for a veranda or for 
a glass roof, of the type comprising at least one span (5) which 

extends in a slope from an upper margin section (2) fixed to a 
wall or the like to a lower margin section (3) forming a sill or 

support, being fixed to these sections, which is delimited 
laterally by sections (25) forming rafters and which comprises 

at least one movable panel (9) able to slide in the direction of 
the slope of the roof, each movable panel (9) being provided with 

movable rolling members (30) in rolling paths (29a) which are 
formed on said sections forming rafters, each of the said 

sections (25) forming rafters comprising a main structure (26) 
which extends symmetrically to the two sides towards the exterior 

by at least two superposed U-shaped sub-sections (27, 29, 31, 
33), characterised in that the said main structure (26) is 

hollow, in that at least one of said U-shaped sub-sections (27, 
29, 31, 33) receives a lateral edge of a fixed panel (6', 6") 

and that the other or others receives or receive, respectively, 
a lateral edge of a movable-panel (9), and in that the faces 

turned towards each other of each of said U-shaped sub-sections 
(27, 29, 31, 33) comprise T-slots intended for the attachment if 

desired of longitudinal brushes (b1 to b6) or the like which rest 
on the corresponding fixed or movable panel (6', 6", 9), or of 

a longitudinal shut-off plate (32) which closes the open end of 
the corresponding U-shaped sub-section (31). 
A system according to Claim 1, characterised by a  
 

longitudinal block (28) interposed between the lower face of each 
of the said fixed panels (6) and the upper face of the lower wing 

(27b) of the associated U-shaped sub-section (27). 
A system according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
by a longitudinal guide block (37) interposed between the edge 

of the said movable panel (9) and the main structure of the 
associated U-shaped sub-section (29). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the said hollow main structure (26) is 

extended upwards and/or downwards by a longitudinal channel 
intended to receive a reinforcement section (39) which is made 

integral therewith. 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the said section forming a rafter (25) 

comprises a cover plate (41) which is made integral with the said 
main structure (26) and which replaces the upper wings (27a, 31a) 

of the upper U-shaped sub-sections (27, 31). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the said movable panel (9) is connected by 

at least one flexible tie (11) to a capstan (12) which is housed 
in 
the said upper margin section (2), which is realised in the 
form of a box.  

 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a plug forming a buffer (9a) is arranged 

inside the span (5) against the said lower margin section (3) on 
the path of the said movable panel (9). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the said opening roof (4) is mounted on the 

said upper margin section (2) and on the said lower margin 
section (3) by means of transverse articulations (14, 

respectively 15). 
A system according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
said upper margin section (2) is constituted by a sectional box 

comprising an angle (17), one-wing of which is made integral with 
the said wall or the like (1) and the other wing of which carries 

at its free end one of the parts of the said articulation (14), 
a section, substantially in the form of an inverted T, the sill 

(18) of which is integral with the base of the said opening roof 
(4) and carries the other part of the said articulation (14), and 

the main structure (20) of which extends upwards and towards the 
wall by a hood (21) in the form of a cylinder portion coaxial 

with the said articulation (14), and a substantially horizontal 
cover plate (22), one edge of which is fixed to the said wall or 

the like (1) and the other edge of which partially covers the 
said hood (21), being substantially tangent thereto. 
A system according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
said hood (21) and the said cover plate (22) are made integral  

 
by fixing means (24) and/or that the tightness means are arranged 

between them. 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised by a retaining member (49) which is integral with 

the said movable panel (9) and which cooperates with a removable 
stop (50) integral with the said lower margin section (3) to 

prevent the opening of the said movable panel (9). 
A system according to Claim 11, characterised in that the 
said removable stop (50) is mounted on a bar (51) which can slide 

transversely and which cooperates with a travel-end contact 
interposed in the circuit of the motor of the said capstan (12). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised by a ramp (52) which is integral with the said 

section forming a rafter (25) and which cooperates with the 
rolling members of the said movable panel (9) and/or with a ramp 

(53) integral with the said movable panel (9). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised by a transverse reinforcement tube (54) integral 

with one at least of the said movable panels (9). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterised by a tight baffle (58) between a movable panel (9) 

and an associated fixed panel (6).  
 
A system according to Claim 15, characterised by a brush 
(b7) which is integral with the free end of the wing (27b) of the 

said U-shaped sub-section (27) and which rests by its bristles 
against the ends of the sections of the said baffle (58). 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 16, 
characterised in that the said opening roof (4) is fixed to the 

said upper margin section (2) and to the said lower margin 
section (3) by means of bolts, the head of which is held in a 

groove which secures it in rotation and the stem of which passes 
through a port permitting dilatations. 
A system according to any one of Claims 1 to 17,
