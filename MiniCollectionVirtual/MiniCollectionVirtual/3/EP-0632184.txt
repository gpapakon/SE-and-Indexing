<CLAIMS>
A sealing-tight profiled section of rubber or elastomer or 
other elastically extensible material, in particular for 

glazed windows, the said profile fitting into or being 
applied to the periphery of the glazing (10) and comprising 

notches (24) formed transversely and at regular intervals in 
the base (16) and in a part of the flank or flanks (18) of 

the profile section, characterised in that the said notches 
(24) are of short unitary length and form transverse pre-cutting 

lines of the dash or dotted type. 
A profiled section according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the said notches (23) are formed throughout the entire 

thickness of the profiled section. 
A profiled section according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the pre-cutting lines are separated 

longitudinally by a distance comprised between approximately 
five and fifteen millimetres. 
A profiled section according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the said notches (24) constitute drain 

slots or orifices. 
A profiled section according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the said notches (24) are formed in 

the profiled section by a rotary wheel (52) carrying radial 
cutter blades (68). 
A profiled section according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the wheel (52) is constituted by an axial stack of 

discs carrying cutter blades (68) having a predetermined 
unitary width.
