<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for manufacturing heat-exchanger elements having a basic tubular body, the cross-section of which has a large width in relation to its height and which is provided on its surface with ribs enlarging the heat-exchange area, and also to a corresponding ribbed tube. On opposite wide sides of the profile (1) of the basic body, in each case a ribbed plate (2) is attached in the longitudinal direction of the profile. The ribbed plate (2) is folded or corrugated and, after being pressed onto the surface of the profile (1) of the basic body, is connected to the latter at least at some bearing points, the profile (1) of the basic body being moved together with the ribbed plates (2) continuously in the longitudinal direction and relative to a fastening means. In order to guarantee reliable fastening of the ribbed plates (2) to the wide sides of the profile (1) of the basic body despite the high rigidity of the ribbed plates (2) and unavoidable tolerances of the profile (1) of the basic body, the profile (1) of the basic body is designed as a profile which is open along a longitudinal line and to the wide side of which a ribbed plate (2) is fastened in each case before the longitudinal margins (1a, 1b) are brought together and connected to one another to make a closed tube.

Method for manufacturing heat-exchanger elements 
having a tubular basic body, the cross-section of which 

has a large width in relation to its height and which is 
provided on its surface with ribs enlarging the heat-exchange 

area, in that the opposite wide sides of the 
basic-body profile (1) each have attached to them in a 

longitudinal direction of the profile a ribbed plate (2) 
which, in each case, is drawn off from a roll and, before 

being attached, is folded or corrugated by a profiling 
means and, after being pressed onto the surface of the 

basic-body profile (1), is connected to the basic-body 
profile (1) at least at a few bearing points, the basic-body 

profile (1), together with the ribbed plates (2), 
being moved continuously in the longitudinal direction of 

the basic-body profile (1) and in relation to a fastening 
means, and the basic-body profile (1) being designed as 

a profile which is open along a longitudinal line and to 
each of the wide sides of which a ribbed plate (2) is 

fastened, before the longitudinal edges (1a, 1b) are 
brought together and connected to one another to form a 

closed tube. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the region of the fastening of the ribbed plates 

(2) to the open basic-body profile (1), the basic-body 
profile (1) is supported from the inside. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the end face of one longitudinal edge (1a) of the 

basic-body profile (1) is connected to a projecting edge 
face (1b) of the other longitudinal edge. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in  
 

that that part of the edge face (1b) projecting beyond 
the connecting line of the two longitudinal edges (1a) is 

detached. 
Device for manufacturing heat-exchanger elements 
with a tubular basic body, the cross-section of which has 

a large width in relation to its height and which is 
provided on its surface with ribs which enlarge the heat-exchange 

area and which are formed by ribbed plates (2) 
attached to opposite wide sides of the basic-body profile 

(1) in the longitudinal direction of the profile, these 
ribbed plates (2) in each case being drawn off from a 

roll and, before being attached to the basic-body profile 
(1), being folded or corrugated by a profiling means and, 

after being pressed onto the surface of the basic-body 
profile (1), being connected to the basic-body profile 

(1) at least at a few bearing points, with a means for 
the continuous movement of the basic-body profile (1) 

together with the ribbed plates (2) in the longitudinal 
direction of the basic-body profile (1) and in relation 

to a fastening means, with a supporting core (9) which is 
arranged inside the basic-body profile (1) in the region 

of the fastening means and which is held by a flange (9a) 
projecting between the separated longitudinal edges (1a, 

1b) of the basic-body profile (1). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the supporting core (9) is provided with supporting 

faces (9b) extending in the direction of the relative 
movement and with recesses (9c) extending between the 

supporting faces (9b). 
Use of a ribbed tube for manufacturing heat-exchanger 
elements with a tubular basic body, the cross-section 

of which has a large width in relation to its 
height and which is provided on its wide sides with 

folded or corrugated ribbed plates (2) which enlarge the 
heat-exchange area and which are connected to the basic 

body at least at a few bearing points, the basic body 
being formed by an originally open profile (1), the 

longitudinal edges (1a, 1b) of which are connected to one 
another to form a closed profile.  

 
Ribbed tube according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the longitudinal edges (1a, 1b) are connected to 

one another by welding, soldering or adhesive bonding.
