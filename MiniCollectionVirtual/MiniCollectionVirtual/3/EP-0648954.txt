<ABSTRACT>
According to an illustrative example of the invention a gas 
spring is provided with an emergency exit permitting escape of 

pressurized gas in case of said pressurized gas exceeding a 
predetermined pressure. The emergency exit is provided by a 

radial bore (13) through the cylinder (1). This radial bore is covered 
unter normal conditions by a piston rod seal (6). This piston rod 

seal (6) is axially displaceable by said pressurized gas at said 
predetermined pressure such that the radial bore (13) is opened for 

escape of pressurized gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent is based on a divisional patent application from European
patent application 92 100 854.6 filed on January 20, 1992 and claiming
priority of January 21, 1991 of DE 41 01 567; the patent application 92
100 854.6 has issued into European patent 0 496 324 B1.The European patent 496 324 B1 has one single independent claim
which reads as follows:A cylinder piston device comprising a cylinder member having an axis, a
circumferential wall and two ends and defining a cavity within said
cylinder member axially between said two ends, a piston rod member
axially guided through at least a first one of said two ends by piston rod
guiding and sealing means, a volume of pressurized fluid within said
cavity and acting onto said piston rod member and at least one
emergency exit permitting escape of fluid from said cavity under
emergency conditions, said piston rod member being telescopically
movable with respect to said cylinder member against the action of said
pressurized fluid, said emergency exit being located adjacent one of said
first and second ends,
characterized in that
said emergency exit is closed under normal operational conditions by a
valve unit in sealing engagement with an internal face of said
circumferential wall, said valve unit having a first side exposed to said
pressurized fluid within said cavity and being axially supported adjacent a
second side thereof by a support structure maintaining said valve unit in
a closing condition under normal operational conditions against the
pressure of said pressurized fluid acting onto said first side such that 
under normal operational conditions said valve unit interrupts
communication between said cavity and atmosphere,
said valve unit being transferable by the pressure of said pressurized fluid
from said closing condition to an opening condition under which said
emergency exit provides a fluid connection between said cavity and
atmosphere, in response to the occurrence of an emergency condition,
said transition being obtained by
resilient axial deformation of said support structureor axial collapse of said support structureor plastic axial deformation of said support structure or supporting said valve unit against axial displacement under
emergency conditions by said support structure in a support area covering only a part of said first side.  Further features of the invention of the parent patent 0 496 324 B1 are
defined in dependent subclaims 2 to 25.There is no hint in claim 1 of the parent patent 496 324 B1 as to an
annular shape of the
