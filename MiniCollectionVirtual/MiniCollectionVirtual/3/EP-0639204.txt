<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel thermotropic liquid crystalline
polyester compositions prepared from hydroquinone,
4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl, terephthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid,
4,4'-bibenzoic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The compositions are
characterized as having melting points less than 365°C, breaking elongations
greater than or equal to 1.5%, and heat distortion temperatures greater than
200°C.This invention further relates to novel glass reinforced/filled
thermotropic liquid crystalline polyester compositions prepared from the
same components given above and additionally containing 20 to 40 weight
percent of at least one glass reinforcing/filling agent. These glass
reinforced/filled compositions are characterized as having melting points
less than 365°C, breaking elongations greater than or equal to 1.8%, and
heat distortion temperatures greater than 230°C.The thermotropic liquid crystalline polyester compositions of the
present invention and the glass reinforced/filled thermotropic liquid
crystalline polyesters of the present invention are advantageous because they
have melting points less than 365°C, which allows them to be manufactured
and processed without undergoing significant thermal degradation.The thermotropic liquid crystalline polyester compositions of the
present invention are further advantageous because they have breaking
elongations greater than or equal to 1.5%; the glass reinforced/filled
thermotropic liquid crystalline polyester compositions of the present
invention are further advantageous because they have breaking elongations
greater than or equal to 1.8%. Breaking elongation is a measure of the
toughness of a composition and increasing values are highly desirable.
Breaking elongations in molded parts greater than or equal to 1.5% (or
greater than or equal to 1.8% for 20 to 40 weight percent glass
reinforced/filled compositions) are rare in liquid crystalline polyester
compositions and are very desirable for many high temperature end-use
applications. The liquid crystalline polyester compositions of the present
invention are also advantageous because they have heat distortion
temperatures greater than 200°C; the glass reinforced/filled liquid
crystalline polyester compositions of the present invention are also
advantageous because they have heat distortion temperatures greater than
230°C. Such heat distortion temperatures make both types of compositions
useful for many high temperature end-use applications. Examples of high
temperature end-use applications
