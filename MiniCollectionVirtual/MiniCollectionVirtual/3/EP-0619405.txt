<ABSTRACT>
In this system, a protective and reinforcing side wall is formed by a sole (S) of a certain height placed on the ground, above which the partition wall (C) proper, made of panels (2), is erected. The sole (S) is produced from prefabricated modules (1) arranged end to end, each including means to be fixed to the ground and to the neighbouring modules. The modules (1) consist of a casing open at its base and at its ends, into which casing has been cast a block of material such as lightweight concrete or synthetic foam.
