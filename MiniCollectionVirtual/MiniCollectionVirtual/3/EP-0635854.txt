<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
material for high frequencies and, more particularly, to a
magnetic composition of a calcium vanadium garnet system
suitable for use in a range of high frequencies such as
microwaves and millimeter-waves.As a magnetic material for high frequencies, there
have been used those such as manganese-magnesium ferrites,
nickel-zinc ferrites, lithium ferrites and yttrium-iron-garnets
(YIG), calcium-vanadium-garnets, etc since they have
a saturation magnetization (4πMs) ranging from (0,05 to 0,4T) (500 to 4000
gauss). Among them, calcium-vanadium-garnets are known to be
a magnetic material with a low magnetic loss which is given
by a ferromagnetic resonance absorption half-line width
(AH). Thus, the calcium-vanadium-garnets make it possible
to produce low-loss circuit elements such as isolators and
circulators since they meet requirements for magnetic
materials to be used for such purposes such that they must
have not only a suitable value of 4πMs but a small ΔH.Japanese patent publication No. 56-31289 (JP-B-56-31289)
discloses a magnetic material of a system (Ca3--yYy)
(Fe2-xInx)(Fe1.5+0.5y-0.5zSizV1.5-0.5x-0.5z)O12 with low 
ΔH, produced by replacing a part of Ca in a calcium-vanadium-garnet
with Y and replacing a part of Fe with In
and Si.On the other hand, it has been reported by H.J.
Van Hook and J.J. Green, "linewidth Reduction through Indium
Substitution in Calcium-Vanadium Garnets", in Journal of
Applied Physics, Vol. 39, No. 2, p730, 1968, that yttrium
and indium substitutions in calcium-vanadium-garnets causes
variations of 4πMs, decrease of the anisotropic field and
reduction of ΔH.However, the above calcium-vanadium-garnets have a
serious problem that a slight deviation of the composition
causes considerable increase in both ΔH and dielectric
dissipation factor (tan δ) and thus interferes with
practical uses.Further, when the magnetic material is used for
self-biased phase converting elements or latching type phase
shifters, it is required to have a large ratio of remanent
magnetic flux density (Br) to maximum magnetic flux density
(Bm), i.e., a large squareness ratio (Br/Bm), as well as
small tan δ. However, the above calcium-vanadium-garnet
materials cannot be applied to the phase converting elements
since the greater Br/Bm the greater is tan δ and since the
smaller the tan 6 the smaller is Br/Bm.It is the object of the present invention to overcome 
the above problems as well as to provide a magnetic material
for high frequencies which is large in
