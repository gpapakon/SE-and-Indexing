<ABSTRACT>
A clip is described with first and second arms
connected together such that they define between them a

space for a belt or the like. A first of the arms has on
an outer surface thereof a socket for receipt of a stud and

carries latch means for releasably retaining the stud in
the socket. The latch means comprises a latching arm

carrying a latching boss, the latching arm being movable
between a first latching position in which the latching

boss protrudes through the first arm into the socket and a
second release position in which the latching boss is

withdrawn from the socket. A latch release member is
provided for moving the latching arm. The latching arm is

an integral extension of the first or second arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clip for attachment to
a belt or the like and to which a stud can be secured, the
stud being in turn connected to an item such as a personal
telephone or bag to allow hands-free carrying of the item.One known clip has two arms pivotally connected
together by a metal strip folded between the two and
attached to both. A first arm defines an open ended
socket for reception of a stud. A latch prevents the stud
from being removed from the socket. The latch is provided
by a boss on the metal strip which protrudes through the
first arm into the socket and is received within an
aperture of the stud. A pusher bar is held within the
first arm and is movable therealong into a position where
it causes flexing of the metal strip and thence removal of
the latching boss from the recess so that in turn the stud
can be removed from the clip.The known clip can be attached to a belt or the
like and for this purpose the second arm has a flange at
the end opposite to that which is connected to the first
arm. A space for a belt is defined between the arms and
between the fold of the strip and the flange. The clip can
also be secured to a piece of material such as a shirt
pocket or jacket front edge, the resiliency of the metal
strip causing the flange to grip the material between it
and the first arm.The above described clip is satisfactory in many
ways. However, it suffers from the disadvantage that it
requires a metal strip. In addition a metal spring is used
to bias the latch release bar away from the latch release
position. The metal adds to the cost of production, the
other pieces of the clip being plastic. In addition, it
makes the clip unsuitable for marine applications as it is
vulnerable to rusting and corrosion. Further, the fitting
of the strip and the metal springs make assembly of the
clip relatively complicated.It is an object of the invention to provide a clip 
which does not suffer from the above disadvantages.A clip in accordance with the invention comprises
first and second arms connected together such that they
define between them a space for a belt or the like, a first
of the arms having on an outer surface thereof a socket for
receipt of a stud and carrying latch means for releasably
retaining the stud in the socket, the latch means
comprising a latching arm carrying a latching boss, the
latching arm being movable between a first latching
position in which the latching boss protrudes through the
first arm into the socket and a second release position in
which the latching boss

A clip comprising first and second arms connected
together such that they define between them a space for a

belt or the like, a first of the arms having on an outer
surface thereof a socket for receipt of a stud and carrying

latch means for releasably retaining the stud in the
socket, the latch means comprising a latching arm carrying

a latching boss, the latching arm being movable between a
first latching position in which the latching boss

protrudes through the first arm into the socket and a
second release position in which the latching boss is

withdrawn from the socket, and a latch release member for
moving the latching arm, wherein the latching arm is an

integral extension of the first or second arm.
A clip as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the latching
arm is an integral extension of the second arm.
A clip as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2
wherein the latching arm is flexed from the first position

to the second position under pressure from the latch
release member and returns to the first position on release

of the pressure through the resiliency of the material from
which the latching arm is formed.
A clip as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the latch release member comprises a pusher rod held by the

first arm but movable therealong on manual pressure on a
button connected to the rod between a locking position and

an unlocking position.
A clip as claimed in Claim 4 wherein biassing means
are provided for biassing the pusher rod towards the

locking position.
A clip as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the biassing
means comprises at least one spring.
A clip as claimed in Claim 6 wherein the leaf
springs are provided integrally formed with the pusher rod.
A clip as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein a
support is provided for holding the latching boss in the

first latching position.
A clip as claimed in Claim 8 when dependent on any
one of Claims 4 to 7 wherein the support is carried on the

latch release member.
A clip as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the first and second arms are fixedly connected together at

or adjacent one end and releasable connection means is
provided for securing the other ends together.
A clip as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the first and second arms are fixedly connected together at

or adjacent both ends.
A clip as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the first and second arms and the latching arm are all

formed of a plastics material.
