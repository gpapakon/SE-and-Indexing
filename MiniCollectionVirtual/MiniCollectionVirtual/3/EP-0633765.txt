<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to alleviation or prevention of
dry flaky skin conditions by the topical application of
stratum corneum chymotrypsin-like enzyme within a skin care
composition. This composition may also be used to
alleviate acne or dandruff.In normal, healthy epidermis the continuous production
of new stratum corneum is balanced by a well-regulated
shedding of corneocytes from the skin surface. Little is
known about this desquamation process at the molecular
level.It has been shown by A. Lundström and T. Egelrud (J.
Invest Dermatol, (1988) 91 340-343; Arch Dermatol Res
(1990) 282 234-237; J. Invest Dermatol (1990) 94 216-220)
that cohesion between cells in the stratum corneum is
dependant on protein structures. These structures must be
degraded before cell dissociation can occur.Furthermore, evidence has been provided to show that
cell dissociation is preceded by a degradation of the
extracellular parts of desmosomes. (T. Egelrud (1992)
European Journal of Dermatology 2 46-49). A. Lundström and T. Egelrud have shown that the
stratum corneum contains a protease enzyme - stratum
corneum chymotrypsin-like enzyme (SCCE) which may be
involved in the process of cell dissociaation
(desquamation): (Acta Derm Venereol (1991) 71 471-474),
and that this enzyme may be involved in desmosomal
degradation.There has been much activity by cosmetic companies to
solve the problem of being able to provide a skin care
composition which is truly effective against dry flaky skin
conditions. However until now no solution to this problem
has been found.We have surprisingly discovered that desmosomal
structures are present in the uppermost layers of the
stratum corneum in dry flaky skin conditions, this is not
the case in normal skin. Furthermore, we have been able to
substantially solve the problem of dry flaky skin
conditions by topical application of a skin care
composition comprising stratum corneum chymotrypsin-like
enzyme.Accordingly the invention provides a composition for
topical application to the skin, which alleviates or
prevents dry skin conditions comprising stratum corneum
chymotrypsin-like enzyme and an acceptable vehicle for the
enzyme.Preferably the composition comprises 0.00001 to 50%
more preferably 0.001 to 20% and even more preferably 0.1
to 10% by weight of the composition stratum corneum
chymotrypsin-like enzyme. Compositions may also additionally include a second
enzyme selected from glycosidases, other proteases, lipases
and mixtures thereof. Preferably the composition comprises
0.00001 to 50%,
