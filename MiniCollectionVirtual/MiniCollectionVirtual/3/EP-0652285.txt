<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fermented milk product
in which the increase in acidity in the low pH region and
during storage at lower temperatures is inhibited, and novel
lactic acid bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus that may be
employed for the preparation of such fermented milk product.The lactic acid bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus
have long been known as a representative starter for
preparation of fermented milk. The lactic acid bacteria of
rod shape, such as the genus Lactobacillus produces lactic
acid of higher acidity than that of the lactic acid bacteria
of coccus such as the genus Lactococcus or the genos
Stretococcus, while being frequently higher in its protease
activity of decomposing milk protein. In particular,
Lactobacillus helveticus exhibits strong protein-decomposing
activity. The peptide generated by decomposition of milk
protein by its extracellular protease has been reported to
exhibit the inhibition activity against angiotensin converting
enzyme (Hereinafter referred to as ACE) which is a substance
responsible for increase in blood pressure. Similar activity
may be noticed with the fermented milk by the Lactobacillus
helveticus. These ACE inhibitory peptides have been confirmed
to exhibit the activity in lowering the blood pressure with
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), as reported by 
Nakamura, Y. et al NIPPON NOGEI KAGAKU KAISHI, 67, 289, 1993.However, Lactobacillus helveticus produces a large
quantity of lactic acid during milk fermentation and hence is
lowered significantly in pH. Besides, the acidity of lactic
acid tends to be increased during storage at low temperature.
Consequently, Lactobacillus helveticus is unsuitabled for
the preparation of yogurt, etc., such that it is scarcely used
at present for yogurt-like fermented milk products.In general, the increase in acidity during storage
following the preparation of yogurt poses a serious problem.
For suppressing such increase in acidity, various trials have
been made such as inprovement of strains by mutation.
However, desired mutant strains have not been obtained because
mutant strains tend to be low in growth activity.Adenosine triphosphatase (Hereinafter referred to as
ATPase) has so far been confirmed to be taking part in
intracellular pH adjustment in the microorganisms. Although
the extracellular pH of lactic acid bacteria is in an acidic
range by the production of lactic acid as a final metabolite
in the fermentation of lactic acid bacteria, the intracellular
pH of the lactic acid bacteria is maintained in
