<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the
regeneration of a hydrocarbon reforming catalyst which has
been deactivated due to buildup of carbonaceous material on
the catalyst. More specifically, the present invention
provides a method for regenerating a coke deactivated
reforming catalyst by a controlled low temperature
carbon-burn procedure which results in the catalyst having
activity, selectivity and stability characteristics
approximating, or which are even better than, the catalyst
prior to the buildup of carbon. The reforming catalysts
intended to be regenerated by the process of the present
invention comprise a molecular sieve material and platinum.Platinum containing catalysts are widely used in the oil
refining and petrochemical industries, and are particularly
important in a reforming process where paraffins, olefins
and naphthenes are converted to aromatic compounds.
Conventional reforming catalysts typically include one or
more metals, most typically platinum, dispersed on a base,
and may also include a binding agent for adding physical
support to the base, and chloride to provide an acidic
function. Typically, the catalyst base is alumina, but
recently molecular sieve based catalysts have been found to
be effective for reforming reactions.Catalytic compositions containing zeolites are well known in
the industry and recently the use of L-zeolites in
combination with other specified catalytic components have
been found to be particularly preferred for reforming. The 
aromatic compounds produced by such a catalytic conversion
are valuable to a refiner due to their higher octane rating,
and may be recovered from the reforming product for further
processing and reaction in the petrochemical industries.
The L-zeolite catalysts are particularly effective for
converting C6 and C7 non-aromatic hydrocarbons which normally
boil between 52°C and 107°C (125°F and 225°F), to benzene and toluene.In the reforming process, a hydrocarbon feedstock is passed
through a catalyst-containing reactor in the presence of
hydrogen at an elevated temperature. In the reactor and
upon contact with the reduced or activated catalyst, some of
the paraffins, olefins and naphthenes in the feedstock react
to form a more desired, higher octane aromatic product. In
the course of typical reforming operations, the catalysts
will typically become deactivated due to the deposition of
carbonaceous material or "coke" upon the catalyst, and/or
sintering or poisoning of the catalytic metal particles. In
