<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to recording sheets, such as transparency materials, 
filled plastics, papers, and the like. More especially, the present invention is directed to 
recording sheets particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. Recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing are known, see for example, U.S. 
Patents 4,740,420; 4,576,867; 4,446,174; 4,830,911; 4,554,181; 4,877,680; 5,223,338 and 
5,212,008, and European Patent Publication 0 439 363 A1.  
 
WO93/01938 describes an ink receptive film formulation comprising an acid having a pKa of 
from 2 to 6. Copending EP-A-615856 and EP-A-615857 describe recording sheets 
comprising respectively tetrazolium, indolinium, imidazole and imidazolinium compounds, 
and monoammonium compounds. It is an object of the present invention to provide improved recording sheets, 
particularly recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. The present invention provides a recording sheet which comprises (a) a base sheet; 
(b) a material as defined in (b) in claim 1, selected from the group consisting of pyridinium compounds, 
piperazine compounds piperazinium 
compounds, and mixtures thereof; (c) an optional pigment; and (d) an optional binder. Recording sheets in accordance with the present invention may preferably comprise a substrate 
and at least two coating layers on one or both surfaces of the substrate. Any suitable substrate 
can be employed. Examples include transparent materials, such as polyester, including Mylar™, 
available from E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company, Melinex™, available from Imperial 
Chemicals, Inc., Celanar™, available from Celanese Corporation, polycarbonates such as 
Lexan™, available from General Electric Company, polysulfones, such as those available from 
Union Carbide Corporation, polyether sulfones, such as those prepared from 4,4'-diphenyl 
ether, such as Udel™, available from Union Carbide Corporation, those prepared from 
disulfonyl chloride, such as Victrex™, available from ICI America Incorporated, those prepared 
from biphenylene, such as Astrel™, available from 3M Company, poly (arylene sulfones), such as 
those prepared from crosslinked poly(arylene ether ketone sulfones), cellulose triacetate, 
polyvinylchloride cellophane, polyvinyl fluoride, polyimides, and the like, with polyester such as 
Mylar™ being preferred in view of its availability and relatively low cost. The substrate can also 
be opaque, including opaque plastics, such as Teslin™, available from PPG
