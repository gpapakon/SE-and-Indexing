<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an elastic bearing bush with an outer, cylindrical bearing sleeve (1) and an inner part (3) held on the inside by a horizontally extending elastomer body (2). To provide additional damping of vibrations of large amplitude, the invention proposes to provide elastic and approximately cup-shaped stops (5, 6) above and below the elastomer body within the spring space. These stops are fixed on the outer bearing sleeve (1) and project into the vicinity of the inner part (3) and enclose between them and the bearing sleeve (1) fluid-filled chambers (10, 11) which are connected to one another by passages (12, 13).

An elastic mounting bush including an outer, 
cylindrical mounting sleeve (1) and an internal part (3) 

held in the interior of a horizontally extending 
elastomeric body (2), said elastomeric body (2) comprising 

elastic stops (5, 6) configured approximately pot-shaped 
cross-sectionally, defined on said outer mounting sleeve 

(1) and extending up to the vicinity of said internal part 
(3), said stops (5, 6) enclosing with said mounting sleeve 

(1) circular section shaped chambers (10, 11) filled with 
fluid as spring suspension cavities interconnected via 

passageways (12, 13), each of said stops (5, 6) being 
spaced away from said elastomeric body (2) by a gap, 

characterized in that longitudinally wedge-shaped caps (20, 
21) of a plastics material are inserted in said gaps (14, 

15) for preloading said bush. 
The elastic mounting bush as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that said pot-shaped stops (5, 6) comprise 

an internal stop cushion (7, 8) configured approximately 
cuboidal and ending spaced away upstream of said mounting 

sleeve (1). 
The elastic mounting bush as set forth in claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that said said passageways (12, 13) are 

oriented centrally to the longitudinal axis of said bush as 
circumferential passageways on the inner circumference of 

said mounting sleeve (1). 
The elastic mounting bush as set forth in any of said 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said internal part (3) 

is configured with an approximately rectangular cross-section 
and with a centerbore (4).  

 
The elastic mounting bush as set forth in any of said 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said gaps (14, 15) are 

flared transversely outwardly between the underside of said 
pot-shaped stops (5, 6) and said elastomeric body (2) 

carrying said internal part (3). 
The elastic mounting bush as set forth in any of said 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said internal part (3) 

comprises dovetail-shaped grooves (22) oriented 
longitudinally on the upper and/or lower side into which 

stop bodies (23) bridging said gap (14, 15) to said stop 
(5, 6) are inserted to produce preloading of said bush.
