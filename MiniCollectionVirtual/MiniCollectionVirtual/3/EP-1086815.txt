<ABSTRACT>
A head cleaning unit (1) for cleaning a printing head
(10) by sucking up waste ink from the printing head (10)

comprises an ink collector (30) attached to the cap (20) so
as to contact with the cap (20). The cap (20) is provided

with a plurality of first ink-suck holes (23, 24) formed on
a bottom surface (22b) of the liquid room (22) so as to

communicate the liquid room (22) with a space limited
between the cap (20) and the ink collector (30). The ink

collector (30) is provided with a second ink-suck hole
formed on a bottom surface (22b) adjacent to the space so

as to communicate the space with the vacuum means. At
least one of the cap (20) and the ink collector (30) is

provided with an air-intake hole (41) for providing air to
the cap (20) or the ink collector (30) by the vacuum means.

At least one (23) of the first ink-suck holes (23, 24) is
arranged along a contact area where the printing head (10)

and the cap (20) contact with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a head cleaning unit which
is applied to an ink-jet printer performing printing with
reciprocating a carriage provided with a printing head back
and forth, in particular, to the cleaning unit for cleaning
the printing head by sucking up waste ink from an inside
and an outside of the printing head.Generally, the ink-jet printer prevents the printing
head from drying by covering an end surface of a nozzle (a
nozzle surface) of the printing head by a cap when the ink-jet
printer does not perform printing. Furthermore, the
ink-jet printer removes the waste ink containing air
bubbles and dust by a head cleaning unit. The head
cleaning unit has a pump. The suck pump vacuums out a
space between the nozzle surface and the cap so as to suck
up the waste ink from the printing head to the space. The
waste ink sucked up to the space is discharged through an
ink-suck tube and the suck pump.For example, such kind of head cleaning units are
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publications (JP-A)
Nos. 259564/1992 and 300641/1997. In a conventional head cleaning unit for the ink-jet
printer, a nozzle surface of a printing head is covered
with a cap. On one side of a bottom portion of a liquid
room formed in the cap, an ink-suck hole for sucking up the
waste ink from a nozzle through the liquid room is formed.
On the other side of the bottom portion of the liquid room,
an air-intake hole for sucking the air into the liquid room
is formed. Furthermore, an ink-suck tube communicated with
a suck pump is coupled with the ink-suck hole.When the suck pump is driven, the liquid room is
vacuumed into negative pressure so that the waste ink is
sucked up from the nozzle of the printing head. On the
other hand, the air is sucked up into the liquid room
through the air-intake hole. Thus, the waste ink is sucked
up (led) into the ink-suck tube through the liquid room
together with the air from the air-intake hole.However, if the conventional head cleaning unit
mentioned above sucks up the waste ink with the suck pump
driven, the unit cannot sufficiently suck up the waste ink
so that the waste ink tends to be left at a slight space
between the nozzle surface and the cap and corners of the
bottom portion of the liquid room. This is because the
only one ink-suck hole and the only one air-intake hole are
formed on one and the other sides of the bottom portion of
the liquid room, respectively. When the waste ink is left
in the cap, the waste ink sticks on the printing head and
soils the printing head. The

<CLAIMS>
A head cleaning unit (1), applied to an ink-jet
printer performing printing with driving a printing head

(10), for cleaning said printing head (10) by sucking up
waste ink from said printing head (10), said head cleaning

unit (1) comprising a cap (20) capable of covering with
said printing head (10) so as to stick on said printing

head (10) and vacuum means for generating negative pressure
in a liquid room (22) formed in said cap, said head

cleaning unit (1) cleaning said printing head (10) by
sucking up the waste ink from said printing head (10),

characterized in that:

said head cleaning unit (1) further comprises an ink
collector (30) attached to said cap (20) so as to contact

with said cap;
said cap (20) being provided with a plurality of
first ink-suck holes (23, 24) formed on a bottom surface

(22b) of said liquid room (22) so as to communicate said
liquid room (22) with a space limited between said cap (20)

and said ink collector;
said ink collector (30) being provided with a second
ink-suck hole formed on a adjacent to said space so as to

communicate said space with said vacuum means;
at least one of said cap (20) and said ink collector
(30) being provided with an air-intake hole (41) for

providing air to said cap (20) or said ink collector (30)
by said vacuum means;
at least one (23) of said first ink-suck holes (23,
24) being arranged along a contact area where said printing

head (10) and said cap (20) contact with each other.
