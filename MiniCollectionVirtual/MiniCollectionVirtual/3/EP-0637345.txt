<ABSTRACT>
For feeding curtain hooks, each consisting of a strip (1) and the hook (5) connected thereto, to a sewing machine which can sew the strip of an infed curtain hook onto a curtain pleat, use is made of a device comprising a storage holder (12) for the curtain hooks, and movement means (9) for moving one curtain hook at a time from the storage holder (12) to a desired position for sewing on the strip of that curtain hook. According to the invention, the movement means (9) move the curtain hooks only in one straight line, the storage holder (12) is in the form of a vertical tube in which the curtain hooks can be stored stacked on top of one another, the bottom end of the storage holder (12) lies in or just above the straight movement path of the moving part (25) of the movement means (9), so that said moving part (25) can pick up the bottom hook in the storage holder (12), and the moving part (25) of the movement means (9) can return to the initial position during sewing on of the strip of the curtain hook held in position by the pressure foot of the sewing machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically feeding curtain 
hooks, each consisting of a strip and a hook connected thereto, to a 
sewing machine which can sew the strip of an infed curtain hook into a 
curtain pleat, comprising: 
a storage holder for the curtain hooks, and movement means for moving one curtain hook at the time from the 
storage holder to a desired position for sewing on the strip of 
that curtain hook. The movement means of this known device comprise a gripping element with 
two claws which are movable relative to each other, and pneumatic 
cylinders to permit movement of the gripping element in two directions at 
right angles to each other. The gripping element is first moved from an 
initial position to the storage holder, for the purpose of picking up a 
curtain hook, and is then moved back to that initial position. The 
gripping element with curtain hook clamped therein is then moved to a 
position above the curtain, and the gripping element is subsequently 
moved to a position where the strip of the curtain hook clamped by the 
gripping element is lying below the pressure foot of a sewing machine. 
Finally, the gripping element is moved back to an initial position. As a 
result of the complicated movement of the gripping element, this known 
machine is complex and expensive, and the device works relatively slowly. The object of the invention is to overcome this drawback and to provide a 
device of the type described in the preamble, by means of which curtain 
hooks, of which the hook portion has got the desired height position with 
respect to the strip portion, can be sewn to pleated curtains at great 
speed in an accurate position, and in the case of which the curtain hooks 
are moved by the movement means in only one direction, without the 
curtain hooks having to be clamped by said movement means. According to the invention, the device mentioned in the preamble is  
 
characterized: 
in that the movement means can move the curtain hooks only in 
one straight line, in that the storage holder is in the form of a vertical tube in 
which the curtain hooks can be stored stacked on top of one 
another, in that the bottom end of the storage holder lies in or just above 
the straight movement path of the moving part of the movement 
means, so that said moving part can pick up the bottom hook in the 
storage holder, in that the device further is provided with setting means for 
setting the adjustably mounted hook of a curtain hook in a desired 
height position relative to the

Device for automatically feeding curtain hooks, each consisting of a 
strip (1) and a hook (5) connected thereto, to a sewing machine which can 

sew the strip of an infed curtain hook onto a curtain pleat, comprising: 

a storage holder (12) for the curtain hooks, and 
movement means (9) for moving one curtain hook at the time from the 
storage holder (12) to a desired position for sewing on the strip 

of that curtain hook,
characterized:
in that the movement means (9) can move the curtain hooks only 
in one straight line, 
in that the storage holder (12) is in the form of a vertical tube 
in which the curtain hooks can be stored stacked on top of one 

another, 
in that the bottom end of the storage holder (12) lies in or just 
above the straight movement path of the moving part (25) of the 

movement means (9), so that said moving part (25) can pick up the 
bottom hook in the storage holder (12), 
in that the device further is provided with setting means (13, 14, 
8, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24) for setting the adjustably mounted hook (5) 

of a curtain hook in a desired height position relative to the 
strip (1) and 
in that the moving part (25) of the movement means (9) can return 
to the initial position during sewing on of the strip of the 

curtain hook held in position by the pressure foot of a sewing 
machine. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in, that
 said setting means 
have such a position with respect to said movement means that of the 

lowest curtain hook in the storage holder the hook position is set with 
respect to the strip before that lowest curtain hook is moved to the 

position for sewing on the strip of that curtain hook. 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in, that
 said setting means 
consist of a cam (13) which can be tilted against a certain moment and 

which can engage in an opening (14) in a strip (1) of a curtain hook in 
order to retain said strip temporarily, a pushing element (8, 18, 19) 

which can move the hook (5) relative to the temporarily retained strip,
