<ABSTRACT>
A needle tip protecting device is provided for hypodermic needles, catheters and the like. The device is small enough to be stored at the base of the needle prior to and during use. After use it may be slid to cover the needle tip where it automatically self-attaches and becomes non-removable. Various embodiments of mechanisms to achieve this effect are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the safe disposal of hypodermic needles by a guard 
device which protects the needle tip from exposure after use. More particularly, it 
relates to a tip protector which is storable on the needle and which automatically locks 
over the end of the needle when slid into position by the user. 2.1 The danger of infection from accidental contact with the pointed end of used 
hypodermic needles has long been recognised and is well documented. For example 
refer to Jagger, Hunt, Brand-Elnaggar and Pearson, the New England Journal of 
Medicine, August, 1988. In mat procedures, the greatest avoidable risk of accidental 
needle puncture, or "needle-stick", occurs during handling of the used needle when it is 
generally inserted into a protective sheath for disposal. This action usually requires 
moving the hand which holds the sheath towards the pointed tip of the needle, and any 
inaccuracy in this operation raises the possibility of a puncture. The risk of this is 
greatly increased if the operator is working under stress, such as time-pressure or 
fatigue, or is handicapped by marginal eyesight or unsteady hands. 2.2 A number of devices have been developed to deal with the general problem of 
needle-sticks, and reference may be made to U.S. Patents 4,747,835 (Sandhaus); 
4,735,618 (Hagen); 4,735,617 (Nelson, Flome); 4,731,059 (Wanderer, Sagstretter); 
4,725,267 (Vaillancourt): 4,720,285 (Pickhard); 4,623,336 (Pedicano, Kane); 4,430,082 
(Schwabacher, et al), and 4,755,170 (Golden). 2.3 Some of these, for example Sandhaus, Nelson/Flome, and Pedicano/Kane, 
provide an enlarged conical entry to the protective sheath, so that the resulting larger 
target reduces the chance of the operator missing the entry. This may he combined 
with some non-manual means of holding the sheath assembly, further reducing the risk. 
All of these devices require the operator to divert his attention from his immediate task 
and to exercise some measure of care in placing the needle into the sheathing device. 2.4 Others of these, for example Hagen and Vaillancourt, aspire to attain the 
desirable goal of keeping the hands wholly behind the sharpened tip of the needle 
during the manipulation of the protective device. The Hagen design stores the tip 
proteetor around the base of the needle, but in this mode the lateral retaining members 
are folded in an "arms akimbo" configuration, extending to either side of the needle in 
a manner which could interfere with the proper manipulation of the syringe and needle
