<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing very finely divided electrically conductive tin(IV) oxide by precipitation of tin(IV) compounds from their aqueous solutions in the presence of fluorine-containing dopers and calcination of the fluorine-doped precipitate tin(IV) compounds, where   a) tin(II) chloride is dissolved or dispersed in water and/or organic aliphatic alcohols or ketones each having at most 6 carbon atoms in the molecule and is converted into a tin(IV) acid (stannic acid) sol,   b) there are added to the tin(IV) acid sol, successively or together, a fluorine-containing compound in such amounts that the molar ratio of tin : fluorine is from 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 0.6, and aqueous alkali metal or ammonium hydroxide or carbonate solution in an amount sufficient to precipitate the tin(IV) oxide or the hydrated tin(IV) oxide, c) the precipitated fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide or hydrated oxide is freeze dried and d) the dried product is calcined within a temperature range from 300 to 600@C for a period of from 8 to 60 minutes.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing very finely divided, 
electrically conductive tin(IV) oxide by precipitation of 

tin(IV) compounds from their aqueous solutions in the 
presence of fluorine-containing dopants and calcination 

of the fluorine-doped precipitated tin(IV) compounds, 
characterized in that 


a) tin(II) chloride is dissolved or distributed in 
water and/or organic aliphatic alcohols or ketones 

each having at most 6 carbon atoms in the molecule 
and is converted into a stannic acid sol by action 

of hydrogen peroxide, 
b) to the stannic acid sol there are added, successively 
or together, a fluorine-containing compound in 

such amounts that the molar ratio of tin: fluorine 
is from 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 0.6 and aqueous alkali metal 

or ammonium hydroxide or carbonate solution in an 
amount sufficient to precipitate the tin(IV) oxide 

or the hydrated tin(IV) oxide, 
c) the precipitated fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide or 
hydrated oxide is freeze dried and 
d) the dried product is calcined within a temperature 
range from 300 to 600°C for a period of from 8 to 60 

minutes. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the solvent used in process stage a) is ethanol. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fluorine-containing dopant used in process 

step b) is hydrofluoric acid, tin fluorides, ammonium or 
alkali metal fluorides or hexafluorosilicic acid. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the calcination in process 
step d) is carried out within a temperature range from 

400 to 500°C. 
Use of the fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide obtained 
according to one or more of the preceding claims as 

pigment, toner or as filler for incorporation into 
plastics, inks, surface coatings, paper or textile 

fibres.
