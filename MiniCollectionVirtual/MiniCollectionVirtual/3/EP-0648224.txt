<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to conformationally restrained peptide analogs as platelet aggregation inhibitors. These compounds inhibit the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet GPIIb-IIIa integrin receptor which inhibits platelet aggregation and therefore these compounds act as potent antithrombotics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conformationally
restrained peptide analogs as platelet aggregation
inhibitors. These compounds inhibit the binding of
fibrinogen to the platelet GPIIb-IIIa integrin receptor
which inhibits platelet aggregation and therefore these
compounds act as potent antithrombotics.Platelets occur in whole blood and are an integral
component of thrombus formation and blood coagulation.
Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, a member of the integrin
superfamily, is found on the platelet surface and
participates in platelet function by interacting with
proteins such as fibrinogen, which contain the amino acid
sequence Arg-Gly-Asp. Various factors activate the GPIIb-IIIa
receptor allowing interaction with fibrinogen and
stimulating platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. A
compound which blocks the interaction of GPIIb-IIIa with 
Arg-Gly-Asp containing peptides such as fibrinogen would
antagonize platelet activation by any stimulus and would be
an important anti-thrombotic agent.Many disease states are characterized by blood vessel
occlusion due to thrombus formation. Some of these
thrombotic diseases are myocardial infarction, stroke,
pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral
arterial occlusion and coronary artery reocclusion
following angioplasty. Patients whose blood flows over
artificial surfaces are also at risk for thrombus
formation. An agent which blocks platelet aggregation by
inhibiting fibrinogen binding to the GPIIb-IIIa receptor
should be useful in these hyperthrombotic states.Small cyclic peptides possessing "bridging" moieties
and "amino acid mimetic" moieties, or the like, useful for
a variety of therapeutic indications, have already been
disclosed in the art. In this respect, reference may be
made to the following documents:
WO-A-91/0133 which relates to certain synthetic
cyclic pentapeptides containing the tripeptide
sequence Arg-Gly-Asp and an alkyl (or other such as
thioether) linkage in the cycle, useful as platelet
aggregation inhibitors;WO-A-92/00995 which relates to cyclic peptides and
peptidomimetic compounds which are characterized by
cell adhesion modulation activity and useful in the
study, diagnosis or treatment of a number of
conditions, including cardiovascular disease,
platelet aggregation and the like.This invention describes such an agent which is a
peptide of varying length and contains the Arg-Gly-Asp
sequence or an analog thereof and is conformationally
restrained by cyclization of an amino acid residue side-chain
onto a backbone (CH2NH) amide bond
