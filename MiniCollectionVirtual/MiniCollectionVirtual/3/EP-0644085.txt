<ABSTRACT>
A self-supporting headliner panel for lining the interior 
surface of an automotive roof comprises a 
front sheet, a back 
sheet and an intermediate corrugated sheet adhered to the front 

and back sheets. The front sheet and the back sheet each 
comprise wood fibers and polypropylene. To form the panel, a 

laminate of the front sheet, the back sheet and the intermediate 
corrugated sheet is molded in a heated mold which melts 

polypropylene fibers in the front and back sheet causing the 
laminate to conform to the shape of the mold and adhering the 

three sheets together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to headliner panels for lining the 
interior surface of an automotive roof and more particularly to 
a self-supporting paper composite headliner panel. The interior surface of an automobile roof is commonly 
covered or lined with a material which presents an attractive 
appearance and also acts as a sound absorber. Molded fiber glass 
panels and foam liners are examples of such liners. Basically, 
these products adequately perform the functions for which they 
were designed. However, they are too expensive to be used in 
economy vehicles. Economy vehicles require a liner that is not 
only attractive and sound absorbing, but one which is less 
costly. One of the materials designers consider when confronted with 
the need to produce an inexpensive shaped product such as an 
automotive headliner is wood fibers. Wood fibers are readily 
available, inexpensive and can be formed into various shapes by 
a variety of manufacturing techniques. Hardboard headliners have 
been manufactured from a wood fiber mat formed from an aqueous 
slurry. The wood fiber mat is placed in a mold where resins in 
the wood fiber mat enable the mat to be compressed to a higher 
density and shaped under heat and pressure. However, this 
product is too heavy; it is difficult to mold; and it has poor 
acoustical properties. Other attempts to produce light, low cost headliners have 
involved forming the headliners from two paperboard facers with 
a corrugated paperboard medium sandwiched between the paperboard 
facers. While inexpensive, these headliners lack adequate sound  
 
absorption properties and are difficult to form, without 
cracking, into the dished shape required for a headliner. U.S. patent nos. 4,886,696 and 5,057,176, disclose a 
corrugated paperboard automotive headliner which solves many of 
the problems associated with the previously discussed headliners. 
The headliner disclosed in these patents is self-supporting, 
inexpensive and exhibits surprisingly good sound absorption 
properties. While the headliner of the '696 and the '176 patents 
performs very well, the self-supporting, light weight headliner 
of the present invention is inexpensive and provides another 
approach to solving the headliner problems associated with 
economy vehicles. The self-supporting, light weight headliner of the present 
invention comprises a front sheet, a back sheet and a corrugated 
paperboard medium intermediate and adhesively bonded to the front 
and back sheets. The front and back sheets are vapor 
impervious,
