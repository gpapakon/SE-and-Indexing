<ABSTRACT>
A recombinant plasmid comprises the cyaC and the cyaA genes of Bordetella which directs the expression of Bordetella, adenylate cyclase in a transformed host cell. A recombinant DNA molecule can comprise the Bordetella cyaA gene containing at least one insertion of a heterologous DNA sequence at at least one permissive site. In addition, a recombinant Bordetella adenylate cyclase comprises a heterologous epitope at a permissive site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition for inducing an immune response, wherein said composition comprises a recombinant adenylate cyclase obtained by expression of the cyaC gene of Bordetella sp. operably linked to an expression control sequence, and of a recombinant cyaA gene of Bordetella sp. encoding adenylate cyclase operably linked to an expression control sequence, wherein said cyaA gene contains at least one insertion of a heterologous DNA sequence in at least one permissive site and wherein the adenylate cyclase is devoid of catalytic activity : and wherein further said expression is performed in a host cell selected from the group of bacteria, eukaryotic cells and yeasts.This application describes a recombinant DNA molecule comprising the adenylate cyclase toxin gene (cyaA) or a fragment thereof containing an insertion of a heterologous DNA sequence at a permissive site, wherein the fragment encodes a polypeptide exhibiting the same immunological properties as the CyaA gene product. In specific embodiments of this invention the heterologous DNA sequence encodes an immunological epitope. CyaA can be obtained from any microorganism or otherwise.This application also describes a recombinant adenylate cyclase comprising a heterologous epitope at a permissive site. In specific embodiments of this invention the heterologous epitope is inserted in the N-terminal catalytic domain of the recombinant adenylate cyclase and can be presented to the immune system in, association with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In other embodiments of this invention the heterologous epitope is inserted in the C-terminal catalytic domain and can be presented to the immune system in association with class II MHC.Methods of inducing specific immune responses in animals immunized with immunological compositions comprising recombinant adenylate cyclases are also disclosed. In specific embodiments of this invention B cell, CD4+, and cytotoxic T-cell responses are specifically induced. With the advent of recombinant DNA techniques for modifying protein sequences, considerable work has been directed toward specifically altering or improving existing proteins. Modification of specific amino acids of enzymes of known structure to alter specificity has been achieved by site-directed mutagenesis. Although knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is restricted to a limited number of proteins, sequence comparisons between members of families of homologous proteins, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of
