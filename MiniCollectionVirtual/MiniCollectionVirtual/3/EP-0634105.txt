<ABSTRACT>
A calcium containing composition obtained by 
baking sea urchin shells gives superior oral 

bioavailability, has better appearance and taste, 

contains low impurity, and provides high yield, and is 
therefore useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of 

various diseases which require calcium supplementation 
such as hypocalcemia, osteoporosis, and renal 

osteodystrophy. Also, it is suitable for inclusion in 
health foods and animal feeds for the purpose of calcium 

supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a calcium containing
composition derived from the shells of sea urchins which
gives high oral bioavailability; a manufacturing method
for such a composition; a food containing such a
composition; an animal feed containing such a
composition, and pharmaceutical compositions containing
such a composition.Various types of calcium formulations and health
foods which contain calcium as an active component have
been proposed previously to supplement dietary calcium.
The calcium used for such formulations and health foods
is generally made from calcium carbonate derived from
mineral origins such as limestone and lime milk, calcium
phosphate, calcium hydroxide, calcium lactate, calcium
gluconate, shellfish derived calcium such as oyster
shells, other mollusc shells and corals, crustaceans
such as crabs, and shrimps, seaweeds such as tangles,
hijikia, and undaria, mammalian bones, and egg shells.However, the calcium made from these materials
generally does not give sufficient oral bioavailability.
Furthermore, oral bioavailability of calcium in humans
is generally extremely low unless it is administered
with Vitamin D or proteins and it is difficult to
supply the required amount of calcium to humans by
itself. In addition, people in Japan take only 531 mg
per day of calcium on average according to the National
Nutrition Investigation Report of the Ministry of
Health and Welfare. This level is less than a half of
that in Western countries.Under such circumstances, the inventors have tried
to find a calcium containing composition having a high 
oral bioavailability. As a result, the invention was
made by the discovery that a calcium containing
composition with high oral bioavailability can be
obtained, surprisingly, by baking sea urchin shells
which have been disposed of as not having any use.The present invention provides a calcium containing
composition derived from sea urchin shells. Also, this
invention includes a manufacturing method for such a
composition; foods containing such a composition; and
pharmaceutical compositions containing such a
composition. There is no limitation on the species of
the sea urchin material, e.g. "Bafun-uni"
(Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus), "Murasaki-uni"
(Anthocidaris crassispina), "Ezobafun-uni"
(Strongylocentrotus intermedius), or "Aka-uni"
(Pseudocentrotus depressus), can be used. To
manufacture the calcium containing composition
described in this invention, the soft content held in
the sea urchin shells is initially removed. This can be
done, for
