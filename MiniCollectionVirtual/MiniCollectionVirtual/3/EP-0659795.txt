<ABSTRACT>
Polyesterpolyols having a hydroxyl number in the range from 175 to 520 which are products of the reaction of   a) from 50 to 60 mol% of a polyol component comprising (i) from 0 to 39 mol% of at least one dihydric alcohol other than neopentyl glycol, (ii) from 20 to 59 mol% of neopentyl glycol and (iii) from 41 to 80 mol% of at least one at least trihydric alcohol with b) from 40 to 50 mol% of a dicarboxylic acid component comprising (iv) from 0 to 60 mol% of at least one (cyclo)aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having at least two carbon atoms, other than fumaric acid, itaconic acid and maleic acid, or the anhydride thereof, and (v) from 40 to 100 mol% of fumaric acid, itaconic acid or maleic acid, or anhydrides or mixtures thereof, and the use of the polyesterpolyols as binder component for two-component polyurethane paints, in particular in the production of paint coatings on large vehicles and in automotive refinishing.

Polyester polyols of the hydroxyl value range from 175
to 520, which constitute reaction products of


a) 50 to 60 mol% of a polyol component with
b) 40 to 50 mol% of a dicarboxylic acid component,

characterised in that

a) the polyol component consists of (i) 0 to 39 mol%
of a divalent aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohol

having at least two carbon atoms other than
neopentyl glycol, or a mixture of two or more

such alcohols, (ii) 20 to 59 mol% of neopentyl
glycol and (iii) 41 to 80 mol% of an at least

trihydric aliphatic alcohol having at least 3
carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols and
b) the dicarboxylic acid component consists of (iv)
0 to 60 mol% of an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic,

saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or the
anhydride thereof having at least two carbon

atoms other than fumaric acid, itaconic acid and
maleic acid or the anhydrides thereof or a

mixture of two or more of such acids or
anhydrides and (v) 40 to 100 mol% of fumaric

acid, itaconic acid or maleic acid or the
anhydrides thereof or mixtures thereof,

wherein the percentages stated in a) and b) in each
case add up to 100.
Polyester polyols according to claim 1, characterised
in that the polyol component a) consists of 0 to

20 mol% of component (i), 30 to 50 mol% of component 
(ii), 50 to 70 mol% of component (iii) and the

dicarboxylic acid component b) consists of 0 to
40 wt.% of component (iv) and 60 to 100 mol% of

component (v).
Polyester polyols according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the polyol component a) consists

of 0 to 10 mol% of component (i), 35 to 45 mol% of
component (ii), 55 to 65 mol% of component (iii) and

the dicarboxylic acid component b) consists of 0 to
20 mol% of component (iv) and 80 to 100 mol% of

component (v).
Use of the polyester polyols according to claims 1 to
3, optionally blended with other organic hydroxyl

compounds, as a binder component for two-component
polyurethane lacquers, which contain lacquer

polyisocyanates optionally together with the auxiliary
substances and additives conventional in polyurethane

technology.
Use according to claim 4 in the production of lacquer
coatings on large vehicles and in automotive repair

lacquer coating.
