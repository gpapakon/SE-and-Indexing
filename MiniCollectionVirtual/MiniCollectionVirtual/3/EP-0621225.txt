Balustrade of a passenger conveyor, such as an 
escalator or a moving pavement, which is provided with a 

deflectable handrail (2), guided by way of rollers (20), 
and which co-operates outside the transport region (21) 

with a panel-like display and information device (7), 
characterized in that the display and information device 

(7) is detachably connected to the balustrade (1) and 
terminates at one end (19) indirectly or directly in the 

region of the handrail deflection (6). 
Balustrade according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that between the handrail (2) and the balustrade (1) in the 

deflection region (3) of the handrail (2) a curved support 
(6), curved to correspond to the shape of the balustrade 

(5), is provided in which one end (19) of the display and 
information device (7) terminates. 
Balustrade according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the curved support (6) is adhesively 

secured to the balustrade (1), which preferably consists of 
transparent material. 
Balustrade according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the region, remote from the rollers (20), 

of the curved support (6) is provided for the guiding of 
energy transmission leads (22), especially power cables. 
Balustrade according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the display and information device (7) 

contains a display (15) for indicating disturbances in the 
operation of the passenger conveyor and/or a lamp (10) 

and/or an emergency stop element (16) and/or a photoelectric 
cell (17) and/or pictograms (12, 13) and/or indicating 

elements (11), for example for floor indication or the 
like. 
Balustrade according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the components (10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17) 

are arranged in a single, approximately cup-shaped housing  
 

(18) and the indicating, operating and information regions 
are provided towards the top (14) or in the direction of 

the transport region (21). 
Balustrade according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the housing (18) contains a flat base 

region (23) which is arranged to be connected by way of 
connecting elements (8, 9) to the corresponding balustrade 

region.
