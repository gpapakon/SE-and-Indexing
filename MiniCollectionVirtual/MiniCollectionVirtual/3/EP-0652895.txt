<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protein fragments which have antiviral activity, and particularly relates to HIV peptides derived from the HIV transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) which inhibit HIV-induced cell-cell fusion. This invention further relates to methods for the inhibition of enveloped viral infection, and to methods that modulate biochemical processes which involve coiled coil peptide interactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention was made with Government
support under grants numbers R01-AI30411 and P30-AI28662
from the National Institute of Allergy &
Infectious Diseases. The Government has certain
rights to this invention.This application is a continuation-in-part of copending
application Serial No. 07/927,532 of C. Wild,
T. Matthews and D. Bolognesi, filed 7 August 1992, the
disclosure of which is to be incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety.- This invention relates to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) protein fragments which have antiviral
activity, and particularly relates to HIV peptides
derived from the HIV transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41)
which inhibit HIV-induced cell-cell fusion. This
invention further relates to methods for the
inhibition of enveloped viral infection, and to
methods that modulate biochemical processes which
involve coiled coil peptide interactions.Numerous HIV protein fragments, or peptides, have
been identified in an effort to develop an effective
HIV vaccine. See generally B. Spalding, Biotechnology
10, 24 (Jan. 1992). Examples of patent applications
which are directed to antigenic epitopes of the gp41
protein include J. Rosen et al., PCT Application WO
87/06005 and R. Duncan, EPO Application 0 371 817. To
date, the development of an anti-HIV vaccine has been
difficult. N. Qureshi et al., Aids 1990 4, 553-558, describe a
segment of the HIV transmembrane protein (designated
"gp41") which inhibits T-cells activation in vitro.
This segment, designated "CS3", when conjugated to human
serum albumin and labeled with fluorescein,binds
specifically to CD4 + cell lines, and is said to have
antiviral activity. CS3 comprises amino acids 581 to 597
of the gp41 protein.B. Kemp et al., EPO Application 0 323 157,describes
a fragment comprised of amino acids 572 to 591 of the
gp41 protein which is said to have antiviral activity.A first aspect of the present invention is a peptide
having the DP-107 amino acid sequence listed in SEQ ID:1.In a preferred embodiment, the amino terminus of this
peptide is acetylated. In another preferred embodiment,
the carboxy terminus of this peptide is amidated.A second aspect of the invention is an isolated multimer
of the isolated peptide having the DP-107 amino acid
sequence listed in SEQ ID:1.More particularly, this multimer can be a tetramer or a
dimer consisting of two peptide monomers.More particularly when the multimer is a dimer, the
monomers of the dimer are covalently bound to one
another.A further aspect of the invention is the use of an
eff
