<ABSTRACT>
For driving a reversible electrical apparatus M, it is mounted within a H-type bridge with a first side formed by first upper and lower switches and a second side formed of first upper and lower switches. In a cyclic way, with a given, constant chopping frequency, the current Im flowing in the apparatus from the first side to the second side is measured, and the difference  DELTA  between an instantaneous datum current and Im is determined. Each cycle is partitioned according to a ratio R into a first part and a second part. R is determined, and, for each part, a datum position for the switches (diagonal mode or free wheel) is determined, depending on the sign DELTA , of the sign of the datum current (or of Im), and of the value of a preselected correlation law, relating, to  DELTA , the mean value of the voltage which it is desired to apply to the apparatus in the course of each cycle.

Method of controlling a reversible electric
device (M) in which said electric device is connected to

first and second centre terminals of an H bridge having a
first side formed by a first top switch T1 and a first

bottom switch T2 connected in series between a maximal
potential line and a minimal potential line, a second

side formed by a second top switch T4 and a second bottom
switch T3 connected in series between said potential

lines, a reverse-biased diode (D1, D2, D3, D4) shunting
each switch, said first centre terminal being connected

between said first switches and said second centre
terminal being connected between said switches, in which

method the current Im flowing in the electric device from
the first side to the second side is measured cyclically

with a given constant switching frequency, the difference
Δ between an instantaneous set point current and the

measured current is determined, and then, depending on
said difference Δ, each switching period T
C
 is divided
with a cyclic ratio R into a first part and a

complementary second part, R denoting the ratio between
the duration of said first part and the total cycle

duration, and for each part a set point setting is
determined for each switch after which said switches are

set to said set point settings, said method being
characterized in that:


a correlation law F is chosen between the ratio
required for each cycle between the mean voltage Um

applied to the device during the cycle and the voltage U
A

between the maximal and minimal potential lines and the
difference Δ such that Um/U
A
 = F(Δ),
either the measured current or the set point
current is selected as a reference current I,
R is computed and the settings of said switches
are determined according to the instantaneous value of Δ 

and the instantaneous sign of I in the three following
cases, 
Ti
 being the logical complement of Ti, Ti = 1 if
switch 
i
 is on, Ti = 0 if switch 
i
 is off:
