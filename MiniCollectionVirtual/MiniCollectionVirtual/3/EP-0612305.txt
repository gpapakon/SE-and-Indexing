<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of flushing a purification plant of a kind which for removal of certain metals, preferably silver, in sewage water comprises at least one prefilter (B) and at least one ion exchange column (C) connected to the prefilter in series. The prefilter (B) and the ion exchange column (C) are individually flushed with pure water. The contaminated flushing water is accumulated in a container (A), and the accumulated rinsing water is caused to pass through the prefilter (B) and through the ion exchange column (C) before it is directed to outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of flushing a purification plant of a kind which 
for removal of certain metals in sewage water comprises at least one prefilter and at least 
one ion exchange column connected to the prefilter in series. The invention relates 
especially to a procedure in which the plant is flushed the silver in the rinsing water from 
x-ray and other photographic laboratories is taken care of. The applicability of the 
procedure is however not limited to this application only, but can also be used to remove 
and take care of other dissolved valuable and/or harmful compounds in sewage liquids. 
The invention also relates to plants in which the procedure may be accomplished. Rinsing water from x-ray laboratories and other phototechnical laboratories contains large 
amounts of silver. To remove the silver from the rinsing water, plants of the type 
mentioned in the preamble are used. The prefilter may contain a filter mass composed of 
sand, activated carbon, zeolites or similar, and in the ion exchange column there is an ion 
exchange mass to which metals can bind. The ion exchange mass can be constituted of 
an anionic or a cationic exchange mass type or constitute a combination of the two ion 
exchange mass types. These plants are doing well under normal operation, by which they can satisfy present 
requirements, which prescribes that water going to the outlet may contain maximum 1.0 
mg silver/â„“ water. By flushing the plant, considerable amounts of silver is released 
however, from both prefilter and ion exchange column, which goes directly to the outlet. 
This dumping have so far been neglected, notwhitstanding that it implies a non-negligible 
environmental pollution, and estimations indicate that in this manner as much as 30% of 
all silver in the rinsing water goes to outlet, which is a serious problem. A first purpose of the invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problem. A purpose 
of the invention is also to offer a procedure, of which basic principles may be utilized by 
flushing purification plants when taking care of other metals than silver. One more purpose of the invention is to offer a procedure which does not require an 
equipment that is too expensive, but which can be made as compact as to fit within a  
 
limited space. A further purpose of the invention is that the procedure could be 
automated and controlled by the use of sensors and a computer. These purposes and others will be achieved herein that the invention is characterized by 
the appending

Procedure for the flushing of a purification plant of a kind which for removal of certain 
metals, preferably silver, in sewage water, comprises at least one pre-filter (B), and at 

least one ion exchange column (C) connected to the pre-filter in series, 
characterized
 in that the pre-filter and the ion exchange column are separately flushed with clean 
water, that the contaminated flushing water is collected in a container (A), and that the 

collected flushing water is caused to pass through the pre-filter (B) and the ion exchange 
column (C), prior to feeding it to outlet. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that when cleaning the pre-filter 
and ion exchange column, said pre-filter and said ion exchange column are first 

purified as far as said certain metals are concerned, that the flushing water which thus 
has been contaminated with said metals is collected in said container, and that thereafter 

at least the main part of remaining contaminations in the pre-filter and in the ion 
exchange column are removed and led to outlet, before the flushing water collected in the 

container is caused to pass through the pre-filter and through the ion exchange column, 
whereafter even this flushing water is led to outlet. 
Procedure according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the pre-filter is first 
cleaned with reference to the said metals, that the flushing water containing the metals is 

collected in said container, that the pre-filter thereafter is cleaned with reference to 
remaining contaminations, that the liquid collected in the container thereafter is led back 

through the pre-filter and further through the ion exchange column, before it is led to 
outlet, that the ion exchange column thereafter is cleaned with reference to said certain 

metals, that the flushing water together with said metals are led to said container, that 
the ion exchange column is cleaned with reference to remaining contaminations which are 

led to outlet together with the flushing water, and that thereafter the liquid contained in 
said container, containing said certain metals from the ion exchange column is led to and 

through the pre-filter and from there to and through the ion exchange column before it is 
led to outlet.
