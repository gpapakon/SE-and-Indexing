<ABSTRACT>
Electric circuit arrangement for operating low-voltage halogen filament lamps (HG), comprising an input filter (EF), a rectifier arrangement (GR), a trigger generator, a half-bridge converter with a control transformer (RK1-A-C), a power transformer (TR1) and a sensor circuit A for overload or short-circuit detection. The latter comprises a sensor diode (D5) and a serial sensor resistor (R11), parallel with the bridge capacitor (C7). At the connection point between the sensor diode (D5) and the sensor resistor (R11) a sensor signal A is tapped which drives the switching-off element (T3, T4). The optional second sensor circuit B comprises a secondary winding (RK1-C) of the control transformer (RK1-A-C) and an additional winding (RK1-D) and generates a sensor signal B. This permits the separate detection of overload and short-circuit with a correspondingly optimised switching-off behaviour.
