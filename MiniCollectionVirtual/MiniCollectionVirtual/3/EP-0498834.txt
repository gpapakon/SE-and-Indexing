<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water-soluble resin that can be used as a dispersant. The resin is substantially built up from units of: A) polyethylene glycol with (5-100) ethylene oxide units, B) a compound containing one or more allyl and/or (meth)acrylate groups and C) the reaction product of one or more unsaturated fatty acids or one or more polyalcohol(s) wholly or partly esterified with unsaturated fatty acids with a compound, where the A:C molar ratio is between 0.5:1 and 4:1 and the B:C molar ratio is between 0.5:1 and 4:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ATER-SOLUBLE RESINThe invention relates to water-soluble resins that can be used as dispersants.Water-soluble resins that can be used as dispersants are described in, for instance, 'Paint Flow and Pigment Dispersion' by T.C. Patton, pp 290-296 (1979). Dispersants known in the art such as, for instance,' polyphosphates, isobutylene maleic acid copolymer-sodium salt and polyacrylateε, cannot be sufficiently mixed with binders such as, for instance, alkyd resin dispersions, to obtain paints with good gloss properties. It is possible also, for instance^ to use water-dilutable alkyd resins as dispersants for pigments. In order to obtain clear solutions and good properties, such as for instance pigment wetting properties, the known resins u&ed as dispersants will, moreover, have to be combined with undesired compounds such as, for instance, amines or organic solvents.The object of the invention is to provide a properly processable, air-drying and water-soluble resin suited as dispersant and resulting in paints with a good gloss.The water-soluble resin according to the invention is characterized in that the resin is substantially built up from units of:A. polyethylene glycol with (5-100) ethylene oxide units, B. a compound containing one or more allyl and/or (meth)acrylate groups and C. the reaction product of one or more unsaturated fatty acids or one or more polyalcohol(s) wholly or partly esterified with unsaturated fatty acids with an compound, where the A:C molar ratio is between 0.5:1 and 4:1 and the 

B:C molar ratio is between 0.5:1 and 4:1.The A:B molar ratio is mostly between 4:1 and 1:4 and is preferably substantially 1:1.Thus a low-viscosity, easily processable, air-drying and water-soluble resin is obtained. If used as a paint dispersant, this resin results in a paint with a good gloss and a good water resistance. For organic as well as inorganic pigments the resin has good pigment wetting properties.This resin, moreover, need not be combined with compounds such as, for instance, amines or organic solvents. Here it consequently also concerns solvent-free systems. Another advantage of the use of the resin as dispersant is that in the preparation of the paint there is hardly any foaming of the dispersant, so that hardly any or no anti-foaming agents need be added.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the A:C molar ratio is between 0.8:1 and 2:1 and the B:C molar ratio between 0.8:1 and 2:1.The best results are obtained if the A:B:C molar ratio is substantially 1:1:1.According to
