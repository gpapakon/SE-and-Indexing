An optoacoustic transducer comprising a wall defining a cavity 
(3), an output passage (5) passing through the wall (1) of the receiver 

and opening into the cavity (3), and a light-transmission member (6) 
extending through the wall of the receiver and opening into the cavity 

(3), characterised in that the output passage (5) is of a diameter and a 
length in a ratio which with the cavity (3) provides a resonant circuit 

having a cutoff frequency in the passband of audible sounds. 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 1 characterised in 
that it comprises a heat-conducting member (10) passing through the wall 

of the receiver and opening into the cavity (3). 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the cavity (3) comprises a reflecting coating (4) 

and that a low-density light-absorption material (9) is substantially 
homogeneously distributed in the interior of the cavity (3). 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the light-absorption material occupies a volume of less than 1% of 

the internal volume of the cavity. 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 3 or claim 4 
characterised in that the light-absorption material is formed by a wad 

of intermingled carbon fibres. 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 2 and one of 
claims 3 to 5 characterised in that it comprises a wall in two parts and 

that the internal reflecting coating of the cavity (3) extends over 
facing surfaces of the two wall parts to form the heat-conducting member 

(10).  
 
An optoacoustic transducer according to claim 6 characterised in 
that the wall parts each substantially define half the cavity (3). 
An optoacoustic transducer according to one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the cavity (3) is spherical and that the light-transmission 

member (6) and the output passage (5) open radially into 
the cavity (3) at radii which are displaced through 90Â°.
