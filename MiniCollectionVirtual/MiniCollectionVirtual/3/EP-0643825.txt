<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REAL TIME CORROSION MONITORING IN HIGH TEMPERATURE SYSTEMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The subject of the invention is an apparatus and method or process for providing real time process condi¬ tion monitoring and more particularly an apparatus and method or process for real time corrosion monitoring at high temperature.Corrosion attack is an inherent problem when operating high temperature combustion equipment. See in this regard, G. A. Whitlow et al. , "On-Line Materials Surveillance For Improved Reliability In Power Generation Systems," NACE 1991 Corrosion Conference, Paper 254. In view of the time over which boilers have been manu¬ factured, it would be expected that corrosion problems have been effectively solved. This is not the case because the multiplicity of factors, which include continued upgrading of designs and the utilization of different fuels. The limitations of service materials are quickly revealed if the composition or temperature of the combustion gas is allowed to vary outside narrow operating limits. The consistent trend for improved thermal efficiency demands that combustion temperatures run ever higher and steam temperatures are also steadily increased. Operating margins which in the past were available to cope with temporary excursions in gas temperature or combustion have been eroded as improved control instrumen¬ tation allowed boilers to be maintained closer to their threshold limits. While scope for improvement still 

exists, operating limits can be rapidly exceeded in large modern combustion plants. The results can be devastating and a great deal of work is in progress to prevent such occurrences. The conventional approach to materials selection is largely based on previous experience in similar systems. In many cases, earlier equipment was smaller and operated at lower temperatures. New plants are typically designed by extrapolation from prior experience. However, many factors are changed when plant capacity is scaled up. For example, the feed system design on a modern unit may have to be adjusted considerably to cope with additional fuel capacity and more stringent environ¬ mental regulations. Most importantly, the volume of the combustion chamber may need to be increased. This frequently causes the gas flow profile to change, especially during periods of reduced load when it is necessary to produce steam at a relatively constant degree of superheat. The change from the proven unit produces a new generation of problems to be solved. The
