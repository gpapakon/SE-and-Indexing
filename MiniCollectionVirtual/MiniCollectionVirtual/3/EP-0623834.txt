<ABSTRACT>
A rugate filter (
10
) having suppressed harmonics includes a layer (
18
) of material 
disposed on a surface (
14
) of an optical substrate (
12
) having an index of refraction 
versus thickness profile that is the superposition of a principle sinusoid and a secondary 

sinusoid. The secondary sinusoid being superimposed about -90 degrees out of phase 
with the principle sinusoid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to rugate filters and, in particular, relates 
to one such rugate filter having suppressed harmonics. Conventional optical filters are usually fabricated by applying a plurality of 
discrete layers of material to an optical substrate. The material of each of the layers is 
selected so that there is a change in the index of refraction at every interface. More 
specifically, the material of the layers is chosen so that the index of refraction alternates 
from a comparatively higher (or lower) value to a comparatively lower (or higher) value 
at each layer interface. As known in the field of optics, when light impinges upon any interface where 
there is a difference in the index of refraction some of the incident light will be reflected. 
Further, at an interface whereat the incident light traverses from a material of relatively 
high index of refraction to a material of relatively low index of refraction a phase change 
of 180 degrees is introduced into the reflected light. Hence, there is, with the appropriate 
choice of layer thickness, destructive cancellation of the reflected light at consecutive 
interfaces. Consequently, the more interfaces an incident light beam traverses, the 
greater the amount of the incident light reflected and canceled. When substantially all of 
the light of a particular wavelength is reflected and canceled before reaching the optical 
substrate, that wavelength of light can be said to have been filtered, or rejected, from the 
incident light beam. It is known and understood that, with such stacked arrangements, 
not only is the principle wavelength rejected but the harmonics thereof are also rejected. More recently, rugate filters have been developed. In the case of rugates, rather 
than forming a plurality of discrete layers of material onto an optical substrate, a single 
layer of material is formed in such a fashion that the index of refraction varies within the 
layer itself. Typically, such rugates are effected by a continuous deposition process 
during which one or more of the materials deposited are varied. Hence, the variation of  
 
the index of refraction. In one particular application, i. e., single wavelength rejection filters, the typical 
rugate will have an index of refraction versus optical thickness profile through the layer 
that is sinusoidal. As used herein the term "optical thickness" is taken to mean the 
product of the mechanical thickness and the index of refraction. However, other profiles 
can be implemented
