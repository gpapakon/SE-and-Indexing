<ABSTRACT>
A folding machine which performs a final plow type fold on 
documents, such as sheets of paper and the like, which sheets may 

have had a pocket fold applied thereto, and which folds a cover 
flap of the document up or down onto the main panel, as required 

compresses the documents, and delivers the folded documents for 
use.

<DESCRIPTION>
A folding machine of the portable type, which performs a 
final up or down plow type fold on documents such as sheets of 
paper and the like, which are held in register, folded, 
compressed, and delivered in folded condition. In the printing trade it is often desirable to provide a 
finished product that has one or more pockets thereon which can 
be used to hold other items. To form a pocket a sheet of paper 
is scored up from and parallel to the bottom to form a flap. A 
glue line is applied to one or more edges of the flap, which is 
folded up along the score line to contact the main sheet of paper 
and form a pocket. In some instances, it is desirable to provide 
a cover over the pocket, in which instance the sheet is scored 
lengthwise to form a cover flap, which also may be provided with 
a pocket, and which cover flap is then folded over and onto the 
main sheet. Various apparatus have been proposed to fold a cover flap up 
and then over onto a main sheet, and various apparatus have been 
proposed to fold a cover flap down, and then up to cover a main 
sheet. Depending on the paper stock, the finish, and other 
considerations, it may be necessary to fold the cover flap up or 
to fold the cover flap down, which until the present invention 
required different apparatus to fold up, or to fold down. No 
single apparatus is available, which can fold the cover flap up 
or down as desired. Examples of prior art apparatus are 
illustrated in the U.S. Patents Nos. 715,620 to Staude; 846,123 
to Mehle; 1,620,444 to Davidson; 1,923,121 to Simmons; 3,572,221 
to Baum; 3,797,371 to Randle; 3,807,289 to Labombarde; 4,586,917 
to Robinson; and 4,747,817 to Newsome.  With some types of paper stock it is very difficult to 
obtain an accurate fold, with the cover flap aligned with the 
main sheet and obtain an acceptable finished product. As the folded or almost folded sheets leave the folding 
sections of various prior art apparatus, they are grabbed by 
mechanism in the delivery or alignment section, and subjected to 
high acceleration forces. The grabbing or nipping action does not always exert uniform 
and perfectly straight forces on the leading edge of the sheet 
being accelerated. Indeed, there is a tendency for some of the 
individual flaps to be cocked or skewed from a desired position 
in which their leading edges are at right angles to the flow 
path. In the event of flaps cocking or skewing as the sheets 
leave the folding section, the subsequent grabbing action 
produces unsymmetrical flap orientation,

<CLAIMS>
A folding machine for performing a plow type fold on 
documents such as sheets of paper and the like, where the 

documents have a longitudinal score line, which divides them into 
a main panel, and a cover flap which comprises 

   a receiving section, 
   a folding section, 

   a delivery section, 
   said receiving section includes means to receive and 

register said documents, 
   said folding section includes a bed plate, 

   an endless driven belt on said plate to receive and 
transport documents to be folded, 

   guide rollers to contact said main panels and to 
initially retain them on said belt, 

   adjustable guide rod means to engage said cover flaps 
as the documents are being transported, to selectively cause said 

cover flaps to be rotated up, or down, about said score lines, 
until they are substantially parallel to said main panels, 

   pressure means to engage said documents along said 
score line and force them onto said bed plate, 

   said delivery section having at least one pair of 
opposed driven rollers, and at least one pair of idler rollers 

spaced therefrom, 
   said pairs of driven rollers are in close proximity to 

each other, and said pairs of idler rollers are spaced apart and 
located above and below said bed plate, 

   endless belts on and connecting said pairs of driven 
and idler rollers to receive said documents from said folding 

section, and carry them to and between said opposed driven belts 
on said rollers compressing said documents. 
A folding machine as defined in Claim 1 in which: 
   said folding section includes an extension plate which 

supports said cover flap until it is in said folding section, and 
until the document leaves said extension plate, and 

   said guide rod means for flap rotation includes contact 
portions above said flaps to engage said cover flaps and urge 

them downwardly and then upwardly about the said score lines as 
 

documents are transported on said bed plate belt until the cover 
flap is parallel to said main panel and said document leaves the 

folding section. 
A folding machine as defined in Claim 2 in which: 
said guide rod means for flap rotation includes contact 

portions below said cover flaps to support said cover flaps as 
they enter said folding section from said extension plate, and to 

urge the flaps upwardly, and then downwardly about said score 
lines as they are transported on said bed plate belt until the 

flaps are parallel to said main panels and the documents leave 
the folding section.
