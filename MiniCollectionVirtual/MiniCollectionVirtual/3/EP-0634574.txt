<ABSTRACT>
A detector comprises an exciter, an igniter, a conductor 
(24) that connects the exciter to the igniter to form a 

discharge circuit, and a current pulse detector for 
detecting current pulses in the circuit. The detector 

comprises a wire (30) disposed in close proximity to a 
current carrying element (32) in the circuit so that a 

sense current is induced in the wire (30) across a 
coreless gap. Means (36) are provided for converting the 

sense current to an output that indicates occurrence of a 
spark discharge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to ignition systems, and 
more particularly to apparatus and methods for detecting the 
occurrence of spark discharges across an igniter. Conventional ignition systems are well known and 
typically include an exciter having an energy storage device 
such as a capacitor and an circuit for charging the capacitor, 
one or more igniter plugs, and a switching mechanism connected 
between the capacitor and the igniter. In aerospace 
applications, the switching mechanism commonly is a spark gap, 
or more recently solid state switches such as SCRs. A control 
circuit is also provided to control when the switching 
mechanism is triggered so that the energy stored in the 
capacitor can be discharged across the igniter gap. During 
the time that the switching device is open, the capacitor is 
charged by the charging circuit. It is often desirable to know whether the ignition system 
is operating properly, particularly to know if the spark rate 
is being maintained. For example, spark rates can be 
significantly affected by operating temperature excursions or 
variations of input voltage or frequency. Also, various 
failure modes within the discharge circuits can prevent proper 
discharge of current through the igniter. Accordingly, many 
ignition diagnostic systems use a current transformer to 
detect discharge current flowing to the igniter, typically 
through the high tension lead or return lead. The current 
transformer includes a wire coil on a high permeability core 
that surrounds the current lead. Discharge current through 
the ignition system cables induces a current in the 
transformer that can then be analyzed by the diagnostic system 
because the induced current is related to the occurrence of a 
spark and current discharge. The current transformer provides 
a way to detect not only the occurrence of a discharge, but  
 
also the corresponding energy level and duration of the 
discharges. Although known current pulse detection techniques are 
useful, they often times are more sophisticated than what the 
customer needs for diagnostic purposes. In many situations, 
the only information needed is that a spark discharge 
occurred. A spark is typically characterized by a high 
frequency current discharge from the exciter through the high 
tension lead and plug. Also, current transformers and similar 
devices have an iron or other heavy core which usually 
requires a fixed mounting of the detector and adds weight to 
the overall ignition system and engine. In aerospace
