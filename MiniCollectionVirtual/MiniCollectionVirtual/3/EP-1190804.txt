<ABSTRACT>
The converter(2) of an ultrasonic vibrating unit(1) is connected to an ultrasonic generator(7) which is switched on and off in response to appropriate signals such that ultrasonic energy is only supplied during a welding cycle. Signals for switching off the energy supply are produced after taking account of one or more status values(P) of the generator. An Independent claim is made for the process equipment which includes a ultrasonic generator(7) connected to a converter(2) and sonic horn(3), lines for producing the on and off signals for the generator at the start and end of the processing cycle and outputs(17,18) for the status value(P) of the generator.

Process for the ultrasonic processing of workpieces (33, 34; 53, 54) with an
oscillatory system (1) having a sonotrode (3, 57) and a converter (2), wherein

the sonotrode (3, 57) is brought close to the workpieces (33, 34; 53, 54) to
perform processing cycles and therein is pressed against one of the workpieces

(33, 34; 53, 54) such that both workpieces (33, 34; 53, 54) are firmly
connected to one another by local melting of preselected regions (35, 60), and

wherein ultrasonic energy is fed to the converter (2) by means of an ultrasonic
generator (7), which is switched on or off through electrical switch-on and

switch-off signals, only for the duration of the processing cycles, 
characterised
in that
 the processing is performed so that the processing cycles are ended
essentially exactly when a selected support face (32) of the sonotrode (3) and a

workpiece surface (36) facing it or two opposing connecting faces (55, 56) of
the workpieces (53, 54) come into mutual contact 
in that
 the switch-off signals
are generated in dependence on at least one electrical variable (P) of the

generator (7), which on mutual contact of the faces (32, 36; 55, 56) undergoes
a characteristic change indicating the contact.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the frequency of the
current flowing in the generator (7), the phase shift between the current and

the voltage of the generator (7) and/or the electrical ultrasonic power (P)
generated by the generator (7) is used as electrical variable.
Device for the ultrasonic processing of workpieces (33, 34; 53, 54)
comprising: an oscillatory system (1) with a sonotrode (3, 57) and an

electromechanical converter (2), a generator (7) connected to the converter (2)
intended for the supply of ultrasonic energy, a feed unit for movement of the

sonotrode (3, 57) during processing cycles in the direction of the workpieces
(33, 34; 53, 54) until a selected support face (32) of the sonotrode (3) and a

workpiece surface (36) facing it or two opposing connecting faces (55, 56) of
the workpieces (53, 54) are brought into mutual contact, means (24, 25) for

generating switch-on or switch-off signals for the generator (7) respectively at
the beginning and at the end of the processing cycles, 
characterised by
 at least 
one output (17, 18 or 43) for the delivery of a selected electrical variable (P) of

the generator (7), wherein the electrical variable is a variable that changes on
mutual contact of the faces (32, 36; 55, 56), and the switch-off signals can be

generated when the electrical variable has undergone a preselected change.
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the electrical variable is the
frequency of the current flowing in the generator (7), the phase shift between

the current and the voltage of the generator (7) and/or the effective power (P)
generated by the generator (7).
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 for the delivery of the
electrical variable (P) the output (17, 18 or 43) is connected to a circuit (44 to

51) intended for delivery of the switch-off signals, which always delivers the
switch-off signals when the electrical variable (P) deviates by a preselected

amount from values, which it can assume for a processing duration recognised
as usable.
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the switch-off signals can
be generated when the electrical variable (P) deviates by a preselected amount

from a mean value, which results during a processing duration between

preselected points in time recognised as usable.
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the circuit (44 to 51)
can be respectively activated only for a preselected time period (t
4
) after
appearance of the switch-on signals (t
0
).
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that
 during spot,
rivet or stud welding the switch-off signals can be generated at points in time

(t
5
), which correspond to the preselected support face of the sonotrode (3)
being placed onto the surface (36) of an associated workpiece (34) facing it.
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that
 during surface
welding with energy direction indicators (60) the switch-off signals can be 

generated at points in time, which correspond to the two connecting faces (55,
56) being brought into surface contact.
Device according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the support face (32a) of the
sonotrode (3) is selected to be larger than is at least necessary to perform the

processing.
