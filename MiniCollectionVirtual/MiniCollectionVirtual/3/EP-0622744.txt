<ABSTRACT>
To assist the design of ASIC-type integrated circuits, their functions are simulated in a parallel-architecture machine (10) which includes, in particular, transputers. The allocation of the resources of this parallel-architecture machine are monitored (21-23) in order to evaluate the performance of the ASIC circuit to be produced.

Method for determining the composition of an integrated 
circuit of the ASIC type provided with an arithmetic and/or 

logic unit, a non-volatile program memory, and one or more 
working registers, including the following steps: 


a list of tasks to be executed with the integrated circuit 
to be determined is established, 
for a given application in a given environment, a task 
consisting of receiving digital signals supplied by so-called 

upstream circuits of the ASIC-type integrated circuit or 
circuits external to the latter, processing the signals 

received, and delivering processed signals to so-called 
downstream circuits of from this ASIC-type integrated circuit 

or circuits external to the latter, 
these tasks are organized together in a computer program, 
characterised in that 
the execution of these tasks is simulated in a parallelarchitecture 
machine of the so-called transputer type, 

including a programming circuit connected to a certain number 
of microprocessors in order to make them execute tasks, this 

programming circuit receiving, originating from the so-called 
upstream circuits, execution requests for the tasks to be 

executed, this programming circuit choosing, for the execution 
of each task, the microprocessor most suitable for executing 

the task, this programming circuit then causing this task to 
be executed by this microprocessor and the processed data to 

be transmitted to the so-called downstream circuits, 
the chronology and duration of the execution of the tasks 
distributed by the programming circuit are recorded, with the 

aim of examining this chronology and this duration, notably of  
 

examining at which moment in this execution of the tasks there 
might be a conflict of processing resources, in order to 

determine the nature of the ASIC-type integrated circuit to be 
produced. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that, in 
order to record the chronology and duration of the execution 

of the tasks distributed by the programming circuit, 

the origins and dates of requests for the execution of tasks 
to be executed, the designations of the microprocessors most 

suitable for executing these tasks chosen by the programming 
circuit and the end-of-execution times recorded by the 

transmission of the processed data to the so-called downstream 
circuits are stored using a microprocessor dedicated to this 

task, 
and this stored information is edited. 
Device for determining the composition of an integrated 
circuit of the ASIC type designed to be provided with an 

arithmetic and/or logic unit, a non-volatile program memory, 
and one or more working registers, characterised in that it 

includes: 

a memory (1) including a list of tasks to be performed with 
the integrated circuit to be determined, 
input ports (2-6) for receiving digital signals supplied by 
so-called upstream circuits (7-9) of the ASIC-type integrated 

circuit or circuits external to the latter, 
a parallel-architecture machine (10) of the so-called 
transputer type, having a programming circuit (15) connected 

to a certain number of microprocessors (11-14) in order to 
make them execute tasks, this programming circuit receiving 

execution requests for the tasks to be executed, originating  
 

from the so-called upstream circuits, 
output ports (2-6) for transmitting processed digital 
signals to so-called downstream circuits (7-9) of this ASIC-type 

integrated circuit or circuits external to the latter, 
a microprocessor (21) dedicated to storing the origins of 
the times of requests for the execution of tasks to be 

executed, the designations of the microprocessors most 
suitable for executing these tasks chosen by the programming 

circuit, and the end-of-execution times recorded by the 
transmission of the processed data to the so-called downstream 

circuits. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that
 
- the microprocessor dedicated to storage is one of the 

microprocessors (14) of the parallel-architecture machine.
