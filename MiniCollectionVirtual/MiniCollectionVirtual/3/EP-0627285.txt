<ABSTRACT>
A device (15, 15') for transverse cutting of a wood veneer 
strip by means of a blade rotating around an axle for 

getting in contact transversely with the strip has a blade 
consisting of two sections (21, 22; 57, 58) independently 

controllable along the axle. 
Means (19, 30, 66) for synchronizing the blades are 
provided for performing jointly, on command, a continuous 

cut along the entire width of the strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
Production of wood sheets by transverse cutting performed
by special automatic cutters from a continuous sheet of
veneer is known. The cutter is usually commanded to cut
sheets in preset dimensions or transverse strips to be
eliminated because they contain defects of the wood, e.g.
holes.For example, CH-354 890 discloses a transverse cutting
apparatus wherein cutting means comprises two side-by-side
transverse blades. If the sheet is wide, the two blades
are operated simultaneously, whereas if the sheet is
narrower than one blade, only one blade is operated. With this procedure it is obvious that the waste of
material is quite high since it is necessary to cut a
strip of material as long as the longitudinal dimension of
the defect and as wide as the entire veneer strip even if
the transverse width of the defect is very limited. In
addition, because of the repeated defects the possibility
of obtaining long sheets is compromised.Subject matter of the co-pending application
EP-A-O 500 161 is a machine for carrying out transverse
cuts selectively on the entire width or on a portion of
the veneer width in connection with longitudinal cuts, so
as to enable the scrap of defective parts with minimal
wood waste.The general purpose of the present invention is to provide
a cutting device for carrying out accurate transverse
cuts.In view of said purpose it has been sought to provide in
accordance with the present invention a device as defined
in claim 1. To further clarify the explanation of the innovative
principles of the present invention and its advantages as
compared with the known art there is described below with
the aid of the annexed drawings a possible embodiment as a
nonlimiting example applying said principles. In the
drawings:
FIG. 1 shows a schematic front view of a veneer cutting
device provided in accordance with the present invention,FIG. 2 shows a schematic partial cross section view of a
disengageable joint of the device shown in FIG. 1,FIG. 3 shows a schematic side view of a possible variant
of the device shown in FIG.1, andFIG. 4 shows a cross section view along line of cut
VII-VII of FIG. 3.With reference to the figures, FIG. 1 shows a cutting
device 15 comprising a rotating blade consisting of two
blade sections 21 and 22 arranged side by side to rotate
coaxially between bucking rollers 23 and 24 by motors 25
and 26 respectively having position sensors.While the blade 21 is supported at the motor end to rotate
without axial sliding, the blade 22 is supported at the
end near its own motor by
