<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
laser and particularly to a semiconductor laser whose active 
layer is made of a II-VI group compound semiconductor material. It is difficult to obtain a satisfactory ohmic 
contact at a p side in a semiconductor laser in which a II-VI 
group compound semiconductor material of ZnSe system or the like 
is used. Therefore, the prior art is encountered by such 
disadvantage that generation of heat at a contact portion causes 
deterioration of an electrode, rise in temperature of an element 
makes long-time operation difficult, or the like. Construction of the ZnSe system semiconductor laser 
as an example will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1A to 1C 
showing manufacturing processes thereof. In this case, first, 
as shown in FIG. 1A, a first cladding layer 2 made of an n type 
ZnMgSSe or the like, an active layer 3 made of an undoped ZnCdSe 
or the like, a second cladding layer 4 made of a p type ZnMgSSe 
or the like, a buffer layer 5 made of a p type ZnSe or the like 
and further a contact layer 6 having a p type ZnSe/ZnTe 
superlattice structure are successively epitaxially grown on a 
substrate 1 made of an n type GaAs or the like. A photoresist 
10 is coated on the contact layer 6 and then subjected to 
patterning by pattern exposure and development in a striped 
fashion so as to cover a region where a striped current path is  
 
to be formed. With using the photoresist 10 as a resist mask, 
the contact layer 6 is subjected to the patterning by chemical 
etching or the like so as to have a striped shape. At this 
time, until a part of each of the buffer layers 5 at both sides 
of the contact layer 6 is removed, the etching is performed. Then, after the photoresist 10 is removed and then a 
polyimide 11 is coated on the whole surface, as shown in FIG. 
1B, only the contact layer 6 is exposed by a proper 
photolithography technique. Next, as shown in FIG. 1C, an electrode 8 formed of a 
multilayer film of Pd/Pt/Au or the like is formed by vacuum 
evaporation or the like so as to completely cover the polyimide 
11 and the contact layer 6. Reference numeral 9 represents an 
electrode which is made of In or the like and previously formed 
by the coating on a rear surface of the substrate 1, for 
example, or the like. As described above, the polyimide 11 blocks the 
current and the region sandwiched by the polyimide 11 is set as 
the striped current path, thereby constructing a semiconductor 
laser of a gain waveguide type. The polyimide 11 has such
