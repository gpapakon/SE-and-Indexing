<ABSTRACT>
The low-pressure automatic programmable artificial snow making plant is of the type which includes a programmable logic modulus (28) sensitive to the meteorologic ranges and it is characterized by the fact that the low-pressure compressed air utilized for the nucleation is produced by an oil circulation screw type compressor (16) and said oil which runs hot during the cycle of compressed air is used directly or indirectly to warm up those parts of the system which run the risk of freezing, clogging or of any other failures caused by very low temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-pressure automatic programmable 
artificial snow making 
plant according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a plant is known, for example, from US-A-4 836 446. Under the specific prior art literature of international patents the following 
are of particular relevance: 
EUROPEAN: 0 004 803; 0 206 705; 0 479 641 U.S.A: 4 105 161; 4 493 457 ; 4 836 446; CA:925 713; 1 028 514 A comparative study of the above cited patents shows that a problem still 
exists: that is how to control automatically the operating conditions of 
low-pressure blowers -near or far- in function of the variable 
meteorologic ranges of ambient air and running operations. 
The system proposed in the present invention is of the type at low-pressure 
and assures the greatest affidability and economy of automatic 
operations. Furthermore, the control of the actuators carrying out the 
automatic continuous adjustments is optimized to security standards, to 
general ergonomic requirements of running operation and particularly to 
the most severe site and environmental conditions.  
 The present invention, which is defined in claim 1, will be best understood from the following 
detailed description when read in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings presented as a non restricting example, in 
which: FIG. 1. Illustrates a single programmable unit for making artificial 
snow consisting of a single blower head at low pressure which is 
connected to the hydric and electric network. FIG. 2. Illustrates at group of neighbouring units which is equipped 
with a meteorologic station capable of detecting the temperature 
and relative humidity of ambient air, as well as the velocity and the 
direction of the wind. This group of blowers is also equipped with a logic programmable 
module capable of collecting and elaborating the meteorologic 
data, as well as data from the plant ,to set up the operating 
conditions of its blowers. The connection between the meteorologic station, the logic 
module, and the blowers can be either via cable or via radio 
communication link. The proximity of the units of the group, the homogeneity of the 
meteorologic conditions and consequently the similarity of the 
adjustments to be carried out in each unit, allow to utilize, for the 
entire group of single neighbouring units , one single meteorologic 
station and one single programmable logic module (28) as well as 
only one of adequate capacity air compressor. FIG. 3. Is a view of a schematic operating layout for a group 
consistin
