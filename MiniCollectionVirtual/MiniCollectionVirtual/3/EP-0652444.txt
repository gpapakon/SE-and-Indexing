<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for forming a potential distribution image of a 
semiconductor integrated circuit (hereinafter referred to 
simply as an IC) and, more particularly, to an IC 
potential distribution image forming method which 
irradiates an IC with an electron beam, ion beam or 
similar charged particle beam, measures the amount of 
secondary electron emission from the IC and displays the 
potential distribution of the IC as a gray-scale image 
which is used, for example, to pinpoint faulty components 
of the IC. The invention also pertains to an apparatus 
using the IC potential distribution image forming method. In an IC tester which tests an IC through the 
sequential application thereto of a predetermined 
sequence of test patterns from a pattern generator, it is 
customary in the prior art to obtain, with an electron 
beam tester by the procedure such as mentioned below, a 
secondary electron emission image on the surface of the 
IC in its operative state under desired drive conditions 
(such as a test pattern sequence, a particular test 
pattern, the pattern phase, the test cycle period and the 
power supply voltage). That is, circulation of a 
predetermined sequence of test patterns is halted at the 
time of generation of a desired test pattern, a desired 
area of the IC made operative by the application of the 
fixed test pattern is scanned with an electron beam spot, 
the amount of secondary electron emission at each 
irradiated spot is measured and used as pixel data to 
thereby display a gray-scale image corresponding to the  
 
amount of secondary electron emission from the respective 
area irradiated with the electron beam. In this 
instance, IC conductor pattern images P1 through P4 such 
as shown in Fig. 1A are displayed. The amount of 
secondary electron emission from the conductor supplied 
with a high potential is small; the corresponding image 
is displayed dark like the pattern images P1 and P2. On 
the other hand, the amount of secondary electron emission 
from the conductor supplied with a low potential is 
large; the resulting image is displayed bright like the 
pattern images P3 and P4. The part 15 other than the 
conductors is displayed gray since the amount of 
secondary electron emission from such a part is 
intermediate between the amounts of secondary electron 
emission from the conductors supplied with the high and 
low potentials. Since the applied test pattern corresponding to 
this display image is preknown, that is, since the
