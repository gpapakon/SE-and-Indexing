<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the catalytic conversion of hydrogen. The device is used for eliminating hydrogen which has been produced as a result of an incident. Said hydrogen is eliminated effectively and without producing a backfire. The aim of the invention is to improve the effect of the recombiner and to prevent the containment atmosphere from heating up. To this end, a recombiner (8) with a plurality of catalytically effective catalyst elements (8a) is arranged in the containment containing the gas mixture, a cooling device (10) is placed downstream from the recombiner (8) and a further cooling device (4) is placed upstream of the recombiner (8).

<CLAIMS>
A device for catalytically converting hydrogen in a containment holding a gas
mixture,


having a recombinator (8) which has a plurality of catalytically acting catalyst
elements (8a),
having a first cooling device (10) which is arranged downstream of the
recombinator (8), and
having a second cooling device (4) which is arranged upstream of the
recombinator (8) and cools the gas mixture,

   
characterised in that
the recombinator (8), the first cooling device (10) and the second cooling
device (4) are arranged such that the gas mixture is able to flow through them

as a result of buoyancy.
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a device (6) for drying the
flow is arranged between the second cooling device (4) and the recombinator (8).
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the device (6) for drying
the flow comprises panels arranged parallel to one another and shaped to be angled

or bent.
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the first
cooling device (10) is arranged substantially above the recombinator (8).
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 at least one
partition wall of the first cooling device (10) and the recombinator (8) are arranged to

be thermally insulated from one another.
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the first
cooling device (10) is directed downwards in the direction in which the gas mixture

flows. 
A device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the second
cooling device (4) and the device (6
) for drying the flow are arranged extending
obliquely downwards in the flow of the gas mixture.
A device according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the
recombinator (8) extends substantially parallel to the second cooling device (4) and

the device (6) for drying the flow.
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 at least one
sensor (17) for measuring the hydrogen concentration is arranged upstream of the

recombinator (8) as seen in the direction of flow.
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 a device (18)
for supplying oxygen is provided, which adds oxygen to the gas mixture before it

enters the recombinator (8).
