least one pair of power transistor chips (Tr1, Tr2) mounted 

on said circuit substrate and each transistor chip having a 
first and a second main electrode and a control electrode, a 

flywheel diode (D1, D2) connected in antiparallel to said 
main electrodes of each power transistor chip, internal 

connection means for connecting one of said main electrodes 
of a first (Tr1) of said transistor chips to one of said main 

electrodes of the second transistor chip (Tr2) so as form the 
upper and lower arms of a bridge circuit, external connection 

terminals (C1, C2E1, E2, G1, G2) for connection to a main 
circuit, of which a first one (C1) is connected to the other 

one of said main electrodes of said first transistor chip 
(Tr1), a second one (C2E1) is connected to said internal 

connection means, and a third one (E2) is connected to the 
other one of said main electrodes of said second transistor 

chip (Tr2), and a first and a second auxiliary terminal (e1, 
e2) of which the first auxiliary terminal (e1) is connected 

to said internal connection means at a position same as the 
position at which the second external connection terminal 

(C2E1) is connected to it or nearer to said one main electrode 
of the first transistor chip (Tr1) than the latter, and 

the second auxiliary terminal (e2) is connected to the third 
external connection terminal (E2), wherein said internal 

connection means provides a predetermined wiring inductance 
(l1) between said one main electrode of the first power transistor 

chip (Tr1) on the one hand and the position at which 
said first auxiliary terminal (e1) is connected to it on the 

other hand. By this structure a surge generated at the time 
of the switching operation is suppressed, while at the same  

 
time, a balance is obtained in the switching characteristics 

between the upper and lower arms of the bridge when the 
internal wiring inductance l1 (l1=l2) is adjusted to have an 

appropriate value.

The present invention relates to a power transistor module 
for use in a power switching device, and more particularly to 
its internal wiring structure. Recently, products with power transistor modules which have a 
bridge circuit construction with a number of transistor chips

"diode"), numerals 6, 7 and 8 indicate external connection 
terminals for connecting the module to a main circuit, numerals 
9 and 10 indicate auxiliary terminals taken out from the 
emitter of each transistor, numeral 11 indicates an internal 
lead connecting the auxiliary terminals 9 and 10 to the 
external connection terminals 7 and 8, respectively, and 
numeral 12 indicates bonding wires connecting the electrodes 
of transistors 4 and diodes 5 to the circuit pattern 3. A circuit substrate such as a DBC substrate (Direct Bonding 
Copper substrate) or an insulated aluminum substrate may be  
 
adopted as the circuit substrate. The signs indicated in 
brackets in FIG. 10(a) correspond to the signs for each of 
the elements and terminals in the equivalent circuit in FIG.
