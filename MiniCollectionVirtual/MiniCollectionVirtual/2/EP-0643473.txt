<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement having a DC motor (19) which has no commutator and is commutated via a semiconductor arrangement (34, 35, 36, 37) has a DC intermediate circuit (13, 14), which can be supplied via a rectifier (11) from an AC or three-phase mains power supply and at whose input, in operation, there is a DC voltage which is subject to ripple and has predetermined maximum values. An in-line transistor (12), which is operated as a variable resistor, is connected between the rectifier (11) and the DC motor (19) which has no commutator. Limiting means (25, 27, 28) are provided, which limit the voltage at the control input of this in-line transistor (12) to a value which is less than the predetermined maximum values of the DC voltage with ripple and is in the region of the dielectric strength of the semiconductor arrangement of the DC motor (19) which has no commutator.

Arrangement with a commutatorless direct-current
motor (19) commutated by means of a semiconductor

arrangement (34, 35, 36, 37),

with a direct-current intermediate circuit (13, 14) which
can be fed from an alternating-current or three-phase

current power supply through a rectifier (11) and at
whose input when in operation there is a pulsating

direct-current voltage with predetermined maximum values,

motor (19) and is operated as a variable resistance,
and with limiting means (25, 27, 28) for limiting the

Arrangement according to at least one of the
preceding claims in which a smoothing capacitor (16) is

disposed in the direct-current intermediate circuit (13,
14), which smoothing capacitor is of a size such that it

at least almost prevents fluctuations in the speed of the
motor (19) due to pulsation of the direct-current voltage

Arrangement according to claim 9 in which the rotor
position sensor (23) emits two signals (Q1, Q2) which are

in each case separated from one another by gaps (a), the
signals being linked together logically and the linking 

signal (X) thus formed serving as the speed signal.

input of an operation amplifier (74) which is connected
as an integrator and differential amplifier and whose

other input can be fed with a set value signal and whose
output signal (Y) controls the series transistor (12)

through continuous alteration of its resistance value.

preceding claims in which the semiconductor arrangement

of the commutatorless direct-current motor is embodied as
a full bridge circuit (33).
