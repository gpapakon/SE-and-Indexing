<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing T-cell count in an immunodeficient 
individual comprises administering to the individual a 

non-toxic organic disulfide of the type defined (e.g. 
cystine or oxidised glutathione) and while the disulfide 

is present in the bloodstream administering to the 
individual an effective dose of microwave electromagnetic 

radiation of frequency in the range of about 400-450 MHz, 
preferably in the range of about 432-436 MHz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method for 
enhancing T-cell count in humans infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). European Patent 
Application No. 0531031 describes compositions and 
methods for cancer therapy. The present invention 
employs selected agents from that therapy in the novel 
application to enhancement of T-cell count. The progression of HIV in an infected individual is 
generally accompanied by a fall-off in the blood count of 
a certain thymus-produced lymphocyte known as a T₄-cell 
or CD₄-cell. T₄ levels in the blood can typically fall 
from about 600-1700 per mm ³ (normal) to about 300 or 
less per mm³ in an individual with advanced HIV 
progression. The T₄ count of an individual is thus 
indicative of the level of immunologically competent or 
potentially competent defender cells circulating in the 
individual's bloodstream. It is believed that the HIV 
virus actually replicates within the infected 
individual's T₄-cells, which thereby release more HIV 
viruses into the bloodstream. The present invention is based on my surprising finding 
that, by administering to an immunodeficient, e.g. HIV-infected, 
individual an effective amount of one or more 
selected chemical agents and while said agent(s) is/are 
present in the bloodstream of the individual 
administering to the individual an effective dose of 
microwave electromagnetic radiation of frequency in the 
range of about 400-450 MHz, the fall-off in the 
individual's T₄-cell count can be halted or reversed, 
leading to a greater ability of treated individuals to 
resist the secondary infections that accompany advanced 
HIV infection (the so-called "full-blown" AIDS). More particularly, the chemical agent(s) used should be 
selected from non-toxic organic disulfides. Included  
 
within the scope of the invention is the use of non-toxic 
precursors of the said agents, which are administered to 
the patient and are modified in vivo to provide the 
desired agent(s) in the bloodstream. For example, a 
thiol can be administered simultaneously with an 
oxidising agent to provide the corresponding disulfide in 
the bloodstream. According to a first aspect, therefore, the invention 
provides a method for enhancing T-cell count in an 
immunodeficient individual, which comprises administering 
to the individual an effective amount of a non-toxic 
organic disulfide of the general formula 
R - S - S - R   (I)in which R is an ethyl group β,β-disubstituted by two 
substituents selected from amino, carboxy, carboxy-(C₁₋₄
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Use of a non-toxic organic disulfide of the general 
formula 

R - S - S - R   (I) 
in which R is an ethyl group β,β-disubstituted by two 

substituents selected from amino, carboxy, carboxy-(C₁₋₄ 
alkyl)carbamoyl, C₂₋₅ alkanamido substituted by amino and 

carboxy, and salt derivatives thereof, in the preparation 
of a composition or compositions for use in a method for 

enhancing T-cell count in an immunodeficient individual 
in which method there is administered to the individual 

an effective amount of said non-toxic disulfide, and 
while said disulfide is present in the bloodstream of the 

individual there is administered to the individual an 
effective dose of microwave electromagnetic radiation of 

frequency in the range of about 400-450MHz. 
A use according to claim 1, wherein the substituents 
of the ethyl group of R in formula I are different from 

each other. 
A use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein any C₂₋₅ 
alkanamido group present is terminally disubstituted by 

one amino and one carboxy group or salt derivatives 
thereof. 
A use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the non-toxic 
organic disulfide is cystine or a non-toxic salt 

thereof. 
A use according to claim 5, wherein the cystine or 
salt thereof is in an aqueous solution at a concentration 

of up to approximately 20 g/l (e.g. approximately 10-20 
g/l). 
A use according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the non-toxic organic disulfide is oxidised glutathione 

or a non-toxic salt thereof. 
A use according to claim 7, wherein the oxidised 
glutathione or salt thereof is in an aqueous solution at 

a concentration of up to approximately 40 g/l (e.g. 
approximately 20-40 g/l). 
A use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein more than one non-toxic organic disulfide of 

formula I is administered sequentially or simultaneously. 
A use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the non-toxic organic disulfide(s) of formula I 

is/are used in association with a potentiating agent 
comprising one or more oxidising agent selected from 

organic peroxides and hydroperoxides of the general 
formula 

R¹ - O - O - R²   (IV) 
and 

R³ - O - OH   (V) 
respectively, in which R¹, R² and R³, which may be the 

same or different, are organic groups which may 
optionally be mono- or poly-substituted. 
A use according to claim 9, wherein R¹, R² and/or R³ 
are selected from alkyl groups, and substituents thereof, 

when present, are selected from halo, nitro, aryl and 
substituted aryl. 
A use according to claim 9 or 10, wherein the non-toxic 
organic disulfides cystine or a salt thereof and 

oxidised glutathione or a salt thereof are used and the 
potentiating agent is t-butyl hydroperoxide. 
A use according to any one of claims 9 to 11, 
wherein the potentiating agent is administered separately 

from the organic disulfide(s) of formula I.
