<ABSTRACT>
Device for supporting a boot on a ski, comprising at least one elongated section (8, 9) made of non-stick material, especially PTFE, flush-mounted in a support plate (10, 40, 60) in an elongated housing (11, 12) which has a cross-sectional shape corresponding to the shape of the section, with a depth which is less than the largest height dimension of the section, and which opens at the upper surface of the support plate in a slot (13, 14) whose width is smaller than the largest width dimension of the section, so that the section is held in the housing, and so that its upper part projects above the upper surface of the support plate. The support plate is made of a flexible material and it has an elongated groove (15) on its lower surface, which groove locally decreases its thickness so that, by bending the support plate, the width of the slot in the housing can be increased to a value which is greater than the largest width dimension of the section (13, 14). The support plate preferably rests on a rib (17) which interlocks in the groove (15).

<CLAIMS>
Device for supporting a boot on a ski, comprising at least one longilinear 
section made of an anti-friction material (8, 9, 48, 49, 70, 71, 72) in particular of PTFE, 

embedded in a support plate (10, 40, 60) in a longilinear housing (11, 12, 62, 63, 41, 42, 
85, 86) whose cross-section has a shape corresponding to the shape of the section, with 

a depth smaller than the largest height dimension of the section, and which opens at the 
upper surface of the support plate through a slot (13, 14) having a width smaller than the 

largest width dimension of the section, so that the section is retained in the housing, and 
that its upper part projects above the upper surface of the support plate, characterized by 

the fact that the support plate is made of a deformable material, that it has at least one 
longilinear groove (15, 81, 83, 84, 89, 90) which is distinct from the longilinear housing 

(11, 12, 62, 63, 41, 42, 85, 86) and which reduces its thickness locally, so that, by 
flection of the support plate, the width of the slot of the housing can be enlarged to a 

value greater than the largest width dimension of the section. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the support plate 
(10) rests on a rib (17) which is embedded in the groove (15). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the support plate 
(10) is flexed when at rest. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that, in cross-section, 
the housings (11, 12) have a width slightly smaller than the width of a section (8, 9). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the housings (62, 
63) incorporate an annular claw (64, 65). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the sections (48, 
49) are incurved.  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the sections (70) 
have an oval cross-section. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the sections (71, 
72) have a cross-section whose upper part is flat. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the support plate 
(82) incorporates at least one groove (83, 84, 89, 90) which opens into the housing (85, 

86) of a section. 
Ski binding, characterized by the fact that it is equipped with a support 
device according to any one of the preceding claims.
