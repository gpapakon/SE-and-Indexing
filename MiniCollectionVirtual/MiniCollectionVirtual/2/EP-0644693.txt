<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device and controlling method 
for reserve recording a VCR(Video Cassette Tape Recorder) 
utilizing teletext data, more particularly to a device and 
controlling method for reserve recording a VCR utilizing 
teletext data, which can carry out a reserve recording a VCR 
utilizing teletext data containing list data for broadcasting 
schedule teletext page of each broadcasting station. Teletext data includes broadcasting schedule teletext 
page telling which page of the transmitted teletext the data 
indicating broadcasting schedule for a broadcasting program of 
the corresponding broadcasting station is in. Accordingly, a conventional VCR reserve recording system 
carries out a reserved recording utilizing information on 
broadcasting schedule teletext page of the teletext data in 
broadcasting signal of the channel under reception at the time 
of reserve recording. And the conventional VCR reserve recording system  
 
requires many steps for recording a desired broadcasting 
program of a broadcasting station because, in case it is 
desired to record a broadcasting program of a channel other 
than a channel under reception at the present time, it is 
required to come out of the teletext mode of the broadcasting 
signal under reception to shift to a channel of a broadcasting 
station desired to record and enter into a teletext mode of 
the corresponding channel, and carry out a reserve recording 
of the broadcasting program. Consequently, the reserve recording system of a 
conventional VCR has problems that it is not convenient for 
use, time consuming, and liable to error since it requires 
many steps for carrying out a reserve recording of a desired 
broadcasting program of a broadcasting station. The object of this invention is to provide a device and 
controlling method for reserve recording a VCR utilizing 
teletext data which permits to carry out easy reserve 
recording of a broadcasting station channel not under 
reception at the present time using teletext data containing 
list data for broadcasting schedule teletext page of each 
broadcasting station.  These and other objects and features of this invention 
can be achieved by providing a device for reserve recording a 
VCR utilizing teletext data including a synchronizing means 
for synchronizing to a particular channel of broadcasting 
signals applied through an antenna, an audio demodulation 
means for demodulating modulated audio signal received from 
the synchronizing means, an audio processor for processing 
audio
