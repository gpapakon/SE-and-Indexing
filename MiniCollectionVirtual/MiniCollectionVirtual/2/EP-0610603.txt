<ABSTRACT>
A fast off-line image processing method for radiographic images is 
disclosed wherein an image is decomposed into detail image and 

multiple resolution levels and a residual image, detail images are 
modified up to a preset resolution level and a processed image is 

reconstructed by means of the modified detail images and the 
residual image. Interactive processing is performed with different 

parameter settings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of digital radiography and
more specifically relates to image processing and display of digital
radiographic images on a workstation.In the field of digital radiography a wide variety of image
acquisition techniques have been developed rendering a digital
representation of a radiographic image.Among such techniques are computerised tomography, nuclear
magnetic resonance, ultrasound detection, detection of a radiation
image by means of a CCD sensor or a video camera, radiographic film
scanning etc.In still another technique a radiation image, for example an x-ray
image of an object, is stored in a screen comprising a
photostimulable phosphor such as one of the phosphors described in
European patent publication 503 702 published on 16.09.92. The
technique for reading out the stored radiation image consists of
scanning the screen with stimulating radiation, such as laser light
of the appropriate wavelength, detecting the light emitted upon
stimulation and converting the emitted light into an electric
representation for example by means of a photomultiplier and finally
digitizing the signal.One of the benefits of a digital radiographic system resides in
the possibility of processing the digital image representation
before display or hard copy recording. The term "processing" in
this context means any kind of image-processing such as noise
filtering, contrast enhancement, data compression etc.The processing can be performed on-line or off-line, the present
invention specifically relates to off-line processing on a graphical
work station.The procedure commonly followed on a workstation is as follows.
The image signal acquired by an image acquisition device as
described above is stored in memory and retrieved from that memory
at the time of off-line processing, the actual processing is then
performed and the processed image is applied to a monitor for
display and evaluation. The processing takes into account 
processing parameters that are either associated to the image in the
very beginning of the process, so for example in an image
identification phase proceeding the read-out phase in case of a
radiation image stored in a photostimulable phosphor screen.
Alternatively processing parameters can be entered by the operator
via the console of the work station or preset processing procedures
can be applied. Processing on a work station is frequently
performed interactively. Then the original image signal is
processed during successive processing cycles with different
parameter

1)-transforming said image into a decomposed image comprising a
sequence of detail images at multiple resolution levels and a

level from said memory,

A method according to claim 1 comprising the steps of
