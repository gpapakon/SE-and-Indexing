<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas mixture 
especially for use as a fire extinguishing agent, a fire 
extinguishing unit comprising the gas mixture, and a method 
for using the gas mixture. Fire extinguishing agents are consumed in large amounts 
all over the world for fire protection in airplanes, ships, 
computer rooms, laboratories etc. Fire extinguishing agents 
are used both at home and in industry. A large consumer, of 
course in addition to fire departments, are the armed forces 
which also use large quantities for training purposes. A standard agent for extinguishing fire is water, but 
in many cases water does greater damage than the fire itself, 
and besides water is unsuitable for extinguishing 
fire in e.g. electrical appliances. Carbon dioxide is also 
a fire extinguishing agent which is frequently used, but 
nor can this be used for all types of fire. The searching for a clean, effective, non-toxic and 
also inexpensive fire extinguishing agent was initiated at 
the beginning of the 20th century. Then the so-called 
halons were developed. Halon is a tradename and comprises 
a number of halogenated hydrocarbons. The halon compounds 
are different combinations of carbon, chlorine, fluorine 
and bromine. Two types of halon gas have been predominant, Halon 
1301 and Halon 1211. Halon 1301 has mainly been used in 
so-called total flooding systems, and Halon 1211 has been 
used for hand-held extinguishers and so-called mobile fire 
extinguishing units (wheel-mounted or in fire-engines). 
Halon 1211 has also been used in permanent installations, 
such as local application systems. A further important 
field of application for Halon 1211 is the protection of 
different types of vehicle, civilian as well as military. 
Generally, engine compartments and other machinery spaces 
are to be protected, but also personnel rooms are objects 
to be protected.  The reason why several types of halon gas have been 
used is, among other things, their physical properties in 
relation to their field of application. Here, the boiling 
point, steam pressure and toxicity have been predominant 
parameters. These halons are clean, effective and relatively non-toxic 
fire extinguishing agents, but in the 1970's it was 
considered to be proved that the halons as well as chlorofluorocarbons 
generally had a strongly ozone-depleting 
effect. Since then a large number of the countries in the 
world have decided and bound themselves to reduce and, in 
the long run, discontinue the production and use of 
halons. The
