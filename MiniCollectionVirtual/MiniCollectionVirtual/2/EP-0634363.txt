<ABSTRACT>
A photocatalyst comprising inorganic porous 
particles having photosemiconductor particles deposited 

on at least a part of the surfaces and at least a part 
of the walls of the pores of the particles, and a photocatalyst 

comprising inorganic porous particles having 
photosemiconductor
 particles and microorganisms possessing 
water purification activity deposited on at least a 

part of the surfaces and at least a part of the walls of 
the pores of the particles are disclosed. The photocatalysts 

have a stable photocatalytic function for an 
extended period of time and easy separability from the 

treated water system so that it is useful for various 
photocatalytic reactions. Particularly they can be 

effectively used in water purification, and allow 
annihilation of harmful organisms such as algae, fungi 

and bacteria, decomposition of deleterious materials, as 
well as deodorization and decoloration to be conveniently 

and easily accomplished.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photocatalyst
and a process for purifying water by utilizing
the function of the photocatalyst.Inhabitant waste waters, irrigation discharge
waters and industrial exhaust waters often contain a lot
of nitrogenous and phosphorous materials which are
provoking eutrophication phenomenon in lakes, marshes,
rivers, sea gulfs and bays. The eutrophication causes
enhanced growth of plankton, picoplankton, water-bloom,
peridinium, and algae, which renders the waters moldy
owing to malodorous 2-methylisoborneol given off by a
kind of plankton, phormidium or oscillatoria and
adversely affects inhabitant environment, especially
water for living. The eutrophication promotes production
of water-bloom and limnetic red-water coloring
waters of lakes, marshes and rivers green or brown as
well as production of so-called red-water coloring sea
water reddish brown, pink or brown, which impair the
scenery, consume oxygen in waters to cause the lack of
oxygen therein. The enormous growth of plankton may
cause clogging of the gills of fish with the plankton 
resulting in tremendous damages in marine products. The
extraordinary growth of algae may cause clogging of
filter screens in water purification facilities, dams
and cleaning ponds to interfere with water purifying
treatment.Moreover, inhabitant waste waters, irrigation
discharge waters and industrial exhaust waters may
contain fungi such as Eumycetes, actinomycetes, for
example, mold, bacteria such as coliform bacteria which
may be grown in lakes, marshes, rivers, sea gulfs and
bays. Microorganisms includes not a few harmful
bacteria such as infectious disease-causing bacteria
such as typhoid bacillus and dysentery bacillus, corrosion
promoting bacteria such as sulfur bacteria, iron
bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria, slime bacteria,
Eumycetes, actinomycetes rendering water malodorous
which have led to occurrence of various disasters.
Particularly, in nursery regions such as ponds and water
containers cultivating animals living in water such as
fish, shell-fish, crab, lobster and frog, and plants
living in water such as seaweeds and marine algae as
well as ornamental ponds and water baths raising fish
and the like, there are often caused contamination of
water and evolution of malodorous gases owing to fecal
matter and deteriorated feed, and growth of fungi and
bacteria on the fecal matter and deteriorated feed.Aside from the foregoing, inhabitant waste
waters, irrigation discharge waters and industrial 
exhaust waters may contain
