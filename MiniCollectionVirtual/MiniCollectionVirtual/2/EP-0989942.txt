<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a box consisting of:
a) a bottom wall,b) a top wall at a distance from and parallel to the bottom wall,c) a first side wall, a rear wall and a second side wall, all between the
bottom and top wall and at right angles thereto,d) an elongated fold-over segment connecting to the bottom wall at the edge
opposite the edge connected to the rear wall and in succession divided by fold lines
into:
d1) a first fold-over wall approximately the size of the front wall,d2) a second fold-over wall approximately the size of the top wall,d3) a third fold-over wall approximately the size of the second fold-over wall. A box of this type is already known from GB-2,241,470. This prior art box is
more specifically destined to hold a video cassette. The box is constructed by folding
the various walls from the flat cardboard blank into a rectangular container which is
open at one side, the side where the elongated fold-over segment is connected to the
bottom wall. Thereafter the video cassette can be inserted into the box, the third fold-over
wall is folded over the second fold-over wall and this combination is folded over
the top such that the first fold-over wall acts as front wall of the box and closes the box.The aim of the invention is now to extend the application possibilities of this box
making use of the fold over walls for attaching or securing other objects thereto, such
as booklets, compact discs, audio cassettes, etc.The invention now provides a box of the type, described above, which is characterized
in that the second wall is provided with means for attaching or securing one
or more audio visual articles (such as CD's, mini-CD's, tape cassettes etc.) and/or the
third wall is provided with one or more insert compartments for inserting flat objects
(letters, cards, books, leaflets etc.).In a preferred embodiment the third fold-over wall is provided with insert
compartments of which the insect slits are extending substantially parallel to the fold lines.Papers, leaflets, cards, thin booklets and the like can be inserted, into the insert
compartments and thereby held in place. The inserted articles are well protected by 
folding the third fold-over wall over the second fold-over wall. When the box is open,
these articles are readily accessible and can be used without impeding access to the actual
box.It is preferable for the fold-over segment between the second and third fold-over
wall to be provided with a compensating segment, the width of which at least
approximately corresponds to the
