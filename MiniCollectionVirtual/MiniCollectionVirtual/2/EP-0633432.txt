<ABSTRACT>
A roller grate, in particular for waste incineration plants, contains rotating, cylindrical, hollow grate rollers (1) which are surrounded by a grate covering and are arranged adjacently axially parallel and spaced apart along an inclined plane. A plurality of coking plates (8) engage periodically and in sections in the storage space (5) between two grate rollers (1) from the rear longitudinal side thereof. These coking plates (8) are connected to the hollow shaft (2) of the grate roller (1), supported in a radially sliding and resilient manner, and emerge through a gap in the grate covering (4).

Roller grate for combustion plants, in particular refuse 
incineration plants, with cylindrical rotating grate rollers (1), which 

consist of a driven hollow shaft (2) and of an outer carrier basket, 
which is formed of grate rod carriers (3) and onto which bent grate 

rods (4) are pushed, wherein the grate rollers (1) are arranged one 
beside the other with their axes parallel along an inclined plane and 

an accumulator chamber (5) is present between the grate rollers (1) and 
bounded at the bottom by wipers (6) and laterally by portions of the 

surface of the grate rollers (1), characterised thereby, that several 
rake plates (8) are guided to be sliding in the grate roller (1) 

radially to the grate roller (1) and that the rake plates (8) pass 
through a gap in the carrier basket of the grate roller (1) and between 

the grate rods (4) and periodically engage by portions from the 
rearward longitudinal side of the grate rollers (1) into the 

accumulator chamber (5) so that the fuel in the accumulator chamber (5) 
experiences a loosening-up as well as an additional turning and 

restratifying. 
Roller grate according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
drive of the rake plates (8) takes place directly through the rotation 

of the grate rollers (1). 
Roller grate according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
grate rod carriers (3) are divided for the formation of the gap. 
Roller grate according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby, that the rake plate (8) is connected with a pusher rod (10), 

which is resiliently borne at the grate roller (1). 
Roller grate according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby, that a stationary axle (19), which is provided with drive 

cams (20), which are each associated with a respective pusher rod (10), 
is led through the hollow shaft (2) of the grate roller (1).  

 
Roller grate according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby, that 
the pusher rod (10) is guided in a guide tube (12), which is firmly 

connected with the hollow shaft (2) of the grate roller (1), that a 
spring holder (15) is screwed into the guide tube (12) and that a 

compression spring (13) is arranged between the end face of the spring 
holder (15) and a shoulder (14) of the pusher rod (10). 
Roller grate according to claim 6, characterised thereby, that the 
pusher (10) is led sealed off out of the spring holder (15). 
Roller grate according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised 
thereby, that the rake plates (8) are shorter by a multiple than the 

grate rollers (1) and that the rake plates (8) are arranged to be 
distributed over the length and circumference of each grate roller (1) 

in such a manner that only one part of the rake plates (8) engages into 
the accumulator chamber (5) row by row for one rotation of the grate 

roller (1). 
Roller grate according to one of the claims 5 to 8, characterised 
thereby, that the drive cams (20) have an external outline which is 

symmetrical to a centre line (21) extending radially of the grate 
roller (1).
