<ABSTRACT>
A branch pipe lining method which can achieve an 
air-tight connection between a pressure bag (7) and a 

branch pipe liner bag (1) in a simple structure without 
employing a conventional sealed tube. An open end of 

the pressure bag (7) is attached to a set nozzle (10) 
coupled to a work robot (6) which is movably installed 

in a main pipe (20). A branch pipe liner bag (1), 
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, is placed inside 

the pressure bag (7), the liner bag having a flange (5) 
which is removably attached to the set nozzle (10) by 

fitting a protrusion (5a) formed on a surface of the 
flange into a concave groove (10c) formed in the set 

nozzle. With the flange (5) being closely contacted to 
the inner wall of the main pipe (20) around a branch 

pipe opening (21a), compressed air is supplied into the 
pressure bag (7) to evert and insert the branch pipe 

liner bag (1) into a branch pipe (21). While the branch 
pipe liner bag is pressed against the inner wall of the 

branch pipe, the thermosetting resin impregnated in the 
branch pipe liner bag is cured, whereby the inne
r wall 
of the branch pipe is lined with the cured thermosetting 

resin, i.e. the branch pipe is repaired. Upon 
completing the lining operation, the protrusion (5a) is 

disengaged from the concave groove (10c), the work robot 
(6) removed and the pressure bag (7) removed from the 

branch pipe liner bag (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a branch pipe living method for lining a
pipe by applying a liner bag on the inner wall of the pipe, and in
particular to a method for lining a branch pipe branching off a
main pipe. The present invention also relates to a liner for use
in such a branch pipe lining method.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed 
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the said
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the said pressurized fluid, and the tubular
flexible liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated
in the liner is heated,

A method for lining a branch pipe (21) branching
off a main pipe (20), comprising the steps of:


(a) providing a pressure bag (7) to an open end of
which is attached a set nozzle(10) couplable to a work

robot (6) which is movably introduced in the main pipe
(20);
(b) placing in said pressure bag (7) a branch pipe
liner bag (1) impregnated with a thermosetting resin and
