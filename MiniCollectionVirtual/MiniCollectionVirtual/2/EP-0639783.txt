<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an infrared objective (lens) (IR objective) having a lens arrangement for imaging an IR image onto a detector element of an IR detector device. This can be a large-area focal plane array (FPA) inside a Dewar vessel with an inner cold shield for largely shielding (screening) the ambient heat radiation (stray light components). Arranged upstream of the inner cold shield is an outer uncooled cold shield composed of a plurality of spaced-apart outer cold diaphragms. In this case, the outer cold shield is arranged partly in front of and/or partly inside the lens arrangement, the outer cold shield with the lens arrangement being designed and arranged with respect to the inner cold shield in such a manner that each optical beam emanating from the detector element and situated outside the optical aperture diaphragm is reflected via the outer cold shield and the lens arrangement back into or onto the inner cold shield, the aperture diaphragm forming one of the cold diaphragms. The IR objective can be designed to be telecentric. The IR objective may be part of a complex IR optics (e.g. a supplementary afocal).

Infrared detection device with

a detection element (14)
a first device, i.e. an inner cold shield (12),
extensively screening the detection element from infrared

rays, with a first incorporated beam inlet opening, i.e.
inner cold screen (15),
an infrared optic (IR-optic 1) for imaging an
infrared picture on the detection element, and
a second device, i.e. an outer cold shield (2; 5;
8), which is serially disposed in the direction of light to

the inner cold shield and which is separated thermally from
the inner cold shield, with a second incorporated beam inlet

opening, i.e. outer cold screen, the outer cold screen being
formed from several incorporated screens (2; 5; 8), which are

arranged staggered, and containing a front screen (2)
arranged directly before or behind a front lens (3) and a

rear screen (8) serially disposed immediately at the inner
cold shield (12)

characterised in that

the outer cold screen is formed such that each optical beam,
which is emitted from the detection element and is located

outwith the optical aperture diaphragm, is reflected back via
the outer cold shield and lands in or on the inner cold

shield outwith the optical surface of the detection element.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
between the front and rear screen (2 and 8) an intermediate

screen (5) is arranged between two lenses (4 and 6), the
front or the intermediate screen being the aperture screen.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the front screen (2) is arranged telecentrically.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the cold screens (2; 5; 8) respectively image on themselves

the opening of the inner cold screen by means of the lenses
(3; 4; 6; 7). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
intermediate screen (5) serves for reducing the free diameter

of the serially disposed lens or lenses.
Device according to Claim 1 and 5, characterised in that
the front screen (2) is designed such that the reflected

picture of the detection element produced by said front
screen (2) is not located on or in the immediate vicinity of

the optical surface of the detection element.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
at least one of the outer cold screens (2; 5; 8) are designed

as blackened cooled surfaces, i.e. light traps.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
at least one of the outer cold screens (2; 5; 8) are

metallised spherical or aspherical caps.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
at least one of the outer cold screens (2; 5; 8) are designed

as retro-reflectors.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the IR-optic (1) in the direction of light consists of the

front screen (2), a first and second optical element (3, 4),
the intermediate screen (5), a third and fourth optical

element (6, 7) and the rear screen (8), the intermediate
screen (5) being arranged on or near the rear side of the

second optical element (4) and the rear screen (8) being
arranged near or on the rear side of the fourth optical

element (7).
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
aperture screen is designed to be adjustable in its opening.
Device according to Claim 2 or 11, characterised in that
the aperture screen is designed to be exchangeable. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the IR-objective (1) is a component of a complex IR-optic,

i.e. an afocal-adjuster F.
