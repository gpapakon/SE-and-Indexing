<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a feeding device for producing a uniform layer of tobacco, whose substantially separated tobacco components can be subjected to special further treatment, such as the identification and removal of foreign bodies. The object is to form a single-layer, continuous tobacco mat on a conveying means. This is achieved by means of successive guide means (4, 7), operated at increasing speed in the conveying direction (2), of which the downstream, faster-running conveying means (7) consists of two superposed conveyor belts (8, 9) which form a conveying channel (11), and the upstream conveying means (4) is designed as a vibrating conveyor (6) which has a profiled discharge edge (24). With the aid of such an arrangement and embodiment of the conveying means a substantially uniform and gap-free single layer of tobacco can be produced at a high throughput.

<CLAIMS>
A feed installation for producing a tobacco monolayer from a
continuously moving flow of tobacco for further processing,

comprising feed means for conveying the tobacco flow and for
separating the tobacco pieces within the tobacco flow, wherein the

feed means comprise, in the feed direction (arrow 2; 102), at least
two successive feed components (4, 7; 104, 107) which are

drivable at different feed rates and form a supply means and a
delivery means and of which the delivery component (7; 107),

arranged downstream relative to the feed direction (2; 102), has a
higher feed rate, characterised in that the delivery component (7;

107) comprises two conveyor belts (8, 9; 108, 109) which form a
feed channel (11; 111), are arranged one above the other and are

synchronously drivable in the feed direction (2; 102).
A feed installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the
supply component (4; 104), arranged upstream relative to the feed

direction (2; 102), is formed as a vibrating conveyor (6; 106).
A feed installation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the vibrating conveyor (6; 106) is inclined downwards in the feed

direction (2; 102).
A feed installation according to claim 3, characterised in that the
inclination of the vibrating conveyor (6; 106) is adjustable 

upwards and downwards in relation to a starting angle in the
region of approximately 15Â°.
A feed installation according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that
the vibrating conveyor (6; 106) is provided with a stepped floor

(13; 113).
A feed installation according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a foreign-body separator (1) is arranged at

the output end of the delivery component (7).
A feed installation according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the delivery component (107), extending at

an angle in the feed direction (102), is followed by a third,
substantially horizontally extending feed component formed as a

conveyor belt (122) which, relative to the delivery component
(107), has a same or preferably lower feed rate.
