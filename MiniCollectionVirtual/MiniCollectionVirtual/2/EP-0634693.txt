<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making 
direct-positive photographic images comprising the steps of 

image-wise exposing a photographic light-sensitive silver halide 
material comprising a support and at least one layer of an internal 

latent image-type silver halide emulsion, and developing said 
exposed photographic silver halide material in a surface developer 

in the presence of at least one development nucleator which is not 
able to react with nor adsorb on the surface of the silver halide 

emulsion crystals prior to development, but which contains a group 
protected against reaction with as well as against adsorption to 

silver halide which is transformed during development into a 
nucleating derivative with an enhanced reactivity for the surface of 

the silver halide crystals. Photographic materials comprising these 
novel development nucleators are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making
photographic images by developing light-sensitive materials in the
presence of development nucleators which do not cause loss of
sensitivity during exposure or unevenness of development. More
specifically the invention relates to the formation of direct-positive
images having a high maximum density and high exposure
latitude and to photographic materials for use in said formation.In silver halide photography a photographic method, according to
which a positive image is made without the use of a negative image
or an intermediary process producing a negative image, is called a
direct-positive method and a photographic light-sensitive element
and a photographic emulsion for use according to such direct-positive
method are called direct-positive element and direct-positive
emulsion respectively.A variety of direct-positive photographic methods are known.
The most useful methods are the method, which comprises exposing
prefogged silver halide grains to light in the presence of a
desensitizing agent and developing them and the method, which
comprises subjecting a silver halide emulsion that has light-sensitive
specks mainly inside the grains to an image-wise exposure
and developing the exposed emulsion in the presence of a development
nucleator. The present invention relates to the latter method.A silver halide emulsion comprising light-sensitive specks
mainly inside the grains and which forms latent images mainly inside
the grains is referred to as internal latent image-type silver
halide emulsion, and thus is distinguished from silver halide grains
that form latent images mainly at the surface of the grains.The development of a latent image formed mainly inside the
grains by means of a so-called internal developer is known, but the
method, material and emulsions used in accordance with the present
invention are not concerned with that type of development, but
rather with the type of development using a so-called surface
developer. Methods for making a direct-positive image by development of
an exposed internal latent image type-silver halide emulsion in the
presence of a development nucleator by means of a surface developer,
and photographic emulsions and photographic light-sensitive
materials used in such methods have been disclosed in i.a. GB-A
