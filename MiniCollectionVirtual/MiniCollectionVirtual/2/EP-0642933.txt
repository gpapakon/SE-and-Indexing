<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to latent image printed matter which uses a combination of projecting image lines of a color identical 
with or similar to that of a printing material and image lines of a color different from that of the projecting image lines to prevent 

the forging and altering of the printed matter and discriminate between genuine printed matter and forged printed matter easily; 
and a printing method for such printed matter. When colored regularly spaced linear image lines the color of which is different 

from that of projecting image lines, such as a multi-line pattern the color of which is identical with that of a printing material are 
printed on these projecting image lines, printed matter the characters and pattern on which can be recognized only when they are 

observed from a predetermined direction is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printed matter which is
required to have some protection so as not to be counterfeited
or falsified, such as bill (paper money), bank note,
security paper, passport, credit card, or other valuable
printed matter. The invention also relates to a method for
printing the above printed matter.Bill (paper money), bank note, security paper,
passport, credit card, and other valuable printed matter are
required, as their nature, to be designed such that they are
not easily counterfeited or falsified. As measures for
preventing the counterfeit of such printed matters, there are
known three types; the first one has a plurality of small and
large half tone dots applied thereto at the printing time,
the second one has a moire pattern, and the third one is
provided with a latent image (hidden letters and figures) applied
thereto by properly determining the drawing direction
of image lines and the quantity of ink to be applied. 
However, since the printed matters provided with the
above counter-measures against counterfeit can be
counterfeited by an ordinary photometrical process, they
are not very effective for preventing the counterfeit.
In addition, recently, it became possible to make
photocopies of the bills, the bank notes, the security
papers, etc. in such a manner as to resemble to the real
ones at a look by a black and white copying machine or
a colour copying machine.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an anti-counterfeit printed matter, which is difficult
to be counterfeited and falsified by a colour copying
machine or a photomechanical process. Any attempt for
copying the printed matter of the present invention using
the colour copying machine or the photomechanical process
will be failed, which makes it possible for anybody to
easily distinguish between the false from the truth.
The present invention is to provide a method for printing
such products and valuable printed matters which are
required to have means for preventing counterfeit and
falsification.Japanese abstract JP-A-0212708 discloses a method
for producing a latent image pattern which uses offset
printing and intaglio printing. The pattern is produced
using offset ink and intaglio ink which are mutually
repellent. As a consequence intaglio ink and offset ink 
cannot be printed on top of each other. The intaglio ink
is printed in all the positions where there is no offset
ink but only in these positions. It is stated in JP-A-02127078
that a latent image appears or disappears when
the angle of view is

<CLAIMS>
A latent image printed matter comprising a substrate
(5) wherein:


one of various kinds of patterns including a
pattern(1), a relief pattern(3) or a combination thereof,

each formed by straight and/or wavy raised image printed
lines(1'', 3''), are printed, in raised condition, on said

substrate(5), said raised image printed lines(1'', 3'')
being printed in coloured ink of a same or similar colour

to that of the substrate(5);
a plurality of straight and/or wavy printed
lines(2') are provided on the surface of said

substrate(5) provided with said raised image printed
lines(1'', 3''), at predetermined spaces in a parallel

relation or in a slant relation to said raised image
printed lines (1'', 3''); said straight and/or wavy printed

lines(2') being printed in a colour other than a
colourless transparent colour and other than the colour

of the raised image printed lines (1'', 3'');
said raised image printed lines(1'', 3'') within
defined portions (f, f') being, at least in part,

provided substantially at an angle with respect to said
raised image printed lines (1'', 3'') outside said defined

portions (f, f'); and
an angular relationship between said raised image 
printed lines(1'', 3'') and said straight and/or wavy

printed lines(2') within said defined portions (f, f')
being, at least in part, substantially different from a

corresponding angular relationship outside said defined
portions(f, f').
A method for making a latent image printed matter
comprising the steps of:


printing, in a raised condition, raised image printed
lines(1'', 3'') on a substrate(5) in such a manner as to
