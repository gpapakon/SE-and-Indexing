<DESCRIPTION>
Norwegian Patent Specification 161,867 describes an 
oil boom conferring a number of advantages. When in use, 
this oil boom is in the form of an elongate hose-shaped 
floating body from which a skirt descends into the water, 
thus acting, together with the floating body, as a barrage 
against oil spills on or near the water surface. The skirt 
is maintained in its descending position by sinkers provided 
at the lower skirt edge. The floating body is maintained 
in a distended hose-shaped state by means of tensioning 
elements in the form of inflatable hoses disposed 
in pockets on the inside of the hose-shaped floating body. 
The oil boom is often manufactured in 50-100-m lengths, 
and several oil booms can be linked together to obtain an 
overall length of 500 m or even more. A considerable advantage of this prior-art oil boom 
is that it can be produced as a flat unit and can be stored 
in a flat state on drums, whence it can be removed for 
mounting and subsequent placing on the site of use in a 
relatively short time. One drawback inherent in this oil 
boom is however that the inflatable hoses that are used 
for distending the floating body have insufficient rigidity 
in the inflated state and, therefore, do not always 
impart the requisite stability and distension capacity to 
the boom when in use. This is indeed a major shortcoming, 
since oil booms are often used under extreme weather conditions 
with high winds and rough sea. In case the distended 
floating body should collapse over a short stretch 
of its length, considerable amounts of collected oil may 
again be dissipated, which is of course detrimental to the 
oil clearing result and the environmental consequences of 
the oil spill. This shortcoming of the known oil boom is primarily 
ascribable to the inflatable hoses which are used for 
distending the floating body and which are made of a pliable 
unextendible material, giving rise to creases or  
 
folds when the straight hoses are bent into ring shape 
during the distension of the oil boom. Moreover, when 
using such pliable unextendible material, sealing problems 
have also been encountered where the hoses are connected 
to couplings. One object of the present invention therefore is to 
improve the known oil boom by reducing the tendency of 
the distended floating body to collapse as a result of 
a deformation of the hose elements used for distending the 
floating body. Another object is to provide a new oil boom 
which is even easier and quicker to mount and place on the 
water
