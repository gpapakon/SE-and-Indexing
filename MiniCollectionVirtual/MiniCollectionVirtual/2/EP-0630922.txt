<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to coating compositions which are suitable for use as primers and fillers in the production of multicoat finishes, in particular in the automotive sector. The coating compositions contain a binder mixture comprising   A) 60 - 75% by weight of a hydroxy-functional copolymer having an OH number of from 110 to 170 mg KOH/g, obtainable from   a) 5 - 60% by weight, preferably 10 - 30 % by weight, of at least one diester of an alpha, beta-olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with saturated monohydric alcohols having 1 - 8 carbon atoms, b) 10 - 70% by weight, preferably 35 - 60% by weight, of one or more vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons, c) 0 - 30% by weight, preferably 0 - 15% by weight, of one or more glycidyl esters of alpha-branched aliphatic saturated monocarboxylic acids, d) 25 - 50% by weight of at least one hydroxyalkyl ester or a mixture of at least one alkyl ester and at least one hydroxyalkyl ester of an alpha,beta-olefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, and e) 0 - 10% by weight of one or more alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acids,     B) 1 - 6% by weight of ester-soluble nitrocellulose,   C) 0.5 - 1.8% by weight of calcium oxide and D) 25 - 35% by weight of one or more difunctional and polyfunctional polyisocyanates.

A coating medium containing a binder vehicle mixture comprising an ester-soluble 
nitrocellulose, a polyisocyanate and a hydroxy-functional copolymer, pigments and/or 

extenders, and optionally customary lacquer adjuvant substances, characterised in that 
the binder vehicle substantially consists of 


A) at least 60 % by weight of a hydroxy-functional copolymer with an OH 
number of 110 to 170 mg KOH/g, obtainable from 


a) 5 - 60 % by weight, preferably 10 - 30 % by weight, of at least one 
diester of an alpha,beta-olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with 

saturated monohydric alcohols containing 1 - 8 C atoms, 
b) 10 - 70 % by weight, preferably 35 - 60 % by weight, of one or more 
aromatic vinyl hydrocarbons, 
c) 0 - 30 % by weight, preferably 0 - 15 % by weight, of one or more 
glycidyl esters of aliphatic, saturated monocarboxylic acids which are 

branched in the alpha position, 
d) 25 - 50 % by weight of at least one hydroxyalkyl ester or of a mixture 
of at least one alkyl ester and one hydroxyalkyl ester of an alpha,beta- 

olefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, 
e) 0 - 10 % by weight of one or more alpha,beta-unsaturated 
monocarboxylic acids, 
B) 1 - 6 % by weight of ester-soluble nitrocellulose, 
C) 0.5 - 1.8 % by weight of calcium oxide, 
D) 25 - 35 % by weight of one or more di- and polyvalent polyisocyanates, 
  
 

wherein the sum of components A), B), C) and D), and of a), b), c), d) and e) adds 
up to 100 % by weight in each case. 
A process for producing multi-layer coatings by the application of a plurality of 
coating medium layers to a substrate to be coated, characterised in that a primer coat 

or primer surfacer coat is produced using a coating medium according to claim 1. 
The use of the coating media according to claim 1 as primer media or primer surfacer 
compositions for the production of multi-layer coatings. 
A use according to claim 3 for the production of multi-layer coatings in the motor 
vehicle sector. 
A multi-layer coating, characterised in that it contains, as a primer coat and/or primer 
surfacer coat, a coat based on a coating medium according to claim 1.
