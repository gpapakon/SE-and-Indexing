<ABSTRACT>
A method of scrubbing a substrate includes the step 
of scrubbing one face of the substrate (1) with a 

cylindrical rotary brush (3) while applying back pressure 
to the substrate by jetting a fluid (2) for generating 

back pressure against the other face of the substrate 
(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The presentinvention relates to method and apparatus 
for scrubbing either face or both faces of a substrate with 
a cylindrical brush while chucking only the periphery of the 
substrate. Recently, semiconductor devices have been evolved from 
very large scale integration (VLSI) into ultra large scale 
integration (ULSI). On a surface of a semiconductor substrate, 
very minute circuits are densely formed using a 
precision photolithographic technique. In the production 
process, microscopic dust particles adhering on the surface 
of the semiconductor substrate will result in defective 
semiconductor circuits and reduce the production yield. The 
production cost steeply rises, as the degree of integration 
of semiconductor devices increases. Therefore, an improvement 
in the production yield will largely contribute to the 
cost reduction, and the removal of dust particles is a very 
important subject. At the production site of semiconductor devices, although  
 
the cleaning of the front face of a semiconductor 
substrate on which microcircuits are formed is strictly 
controlled, control on the cleaning of the back face is not 
so strict at present. During the production processes, the 
back face of the semiconductor substrate is brought into 
contact with suction bases of equipment and handling devices, 
and becomes contaminated. The contamination of the 
back face is found to be one of the causes of the contamination 
of the front face. Though sufficient cleaning of the back face of the 
semiconductor substrate has recently been added to the 
production process, there still exist problems as follows: 
(1) Since microcircuits are densely formed on the front 
face of a semiconductor substrate as previously mentioned, 
the substrate cannot be supported at the front face thereof 
for the scrubbing of the back face thereof. Accordingly, 
the semiconductor substrate has to be supported by chucking 
the periphery of the substrate with a chuck jaw without 
supporting a central portion of the front face of the substrate 
for the scrubbing of the back face. However, since a 
chuck jaw for chucking the periphery of the substrate 
slightly projects outwardly of the scrub face of the substrate, 
a disk brush as shown in Fig. 21 which has a small 
scrubbing area and hence is of an insufficient scrubbing  
 
ability is conventionally used for the scrubbing. (2) When the back face of the semiconductor substrate is 
scrubbed with a scrubbing means such as a brush with its 
periphery being chucked by the chuck jaw as
