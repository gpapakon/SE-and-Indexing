Device for measuring the amount of paramagnetic
materials in a mixture of materials, in particular the

amount of oxygen, in which a cuvette arrangement
rotates in a magnetic field through which passes

alternately a cuvette chamber filled with the
paramagnetic material to be detected, and a reference

chamber filled with a reference material, whereby the
magnetic alternating field produced during rotation due

to the different magnetic flux through respectively the
cuvette chamber and the reference chamber generates in

one or several measurement field coils an induced
alternating voltage signal which is composed of a

measurement signal generated by the cuvette chamber,
and a reference signal generated by the reference

chamber, which is used as a measure of the
concentration of paramagnetic material in the cuvette

chamber and which is conveyed to an evaluation unit,
wherein the cuvette arrangement carries a magnetic

compensation device, characterised in that the
compensation device is composed of an induction loop

(22) of electrically conductive material with a
terminal resistance (23) which is fitted in the plane

of rotation of the cuvette arrangement (2) at a point
such that during rotation of the cuvette arrangement

(2) the induction loop (22) generates a compensation
voltage in the measurement field coils (7) which is of

the same amplitude as the basic signal generated as a
consequence of the differences in material thickness

between the cuvette chamber (8) and the reference
chamber (2), but which has the opposite phase to the

basic signal.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the loop (22) is arranged to extend lengthwise in the 

radial direction along the cuvette surface.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that
the cuvette arrangement is composed of a circular

disc (2) of diamagnetic material into which are
fitted openings (8) which are symmetrical with respect

to the axis of rotation and through which the
paramagnetic material to be detected can flow, and in

that the loop (22) is arranged in the direction of
rotation (21) behind the opening at an angular position

corresponding to a quarter of the angle between
adjacent openings (8).
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that
the openings are formed as circular ring segments (8)

extending concentrically around the axis of rotation.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that
the openings are formed with an outline (8) extending

in a kidney shape concentrically to the axis of
rotation.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the induced alternating voltage
is supplied to an integrator before further signal

processing in the evaluation unit.
