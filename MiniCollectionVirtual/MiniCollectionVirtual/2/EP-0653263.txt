<ABSTRACT>
A method for repairing boiler tube walls (10) by 
cutting out and replacing a worn or damaged section 

thereof involves the use of a power tool (18) having a rotary 
milling head (20) specially adapted to remove membrane (16) material 

from between tube ends (12) which are exposed when the damaged 
section is removed and optionally to simultaneously bevel 

the end of a tube as membrane material is being removed. 
The method and apparatus of the invention allows for the 

rapid and precise removal of membrane material from 
between the exposed tube ends to facilitate subsequent 

beveling and welding operations or for concurrent beveling 
and membrane removal, while substantially reducing the 

risk of weakening or damaging the tube wall by avoiding 
excess removal of material therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the repair of boiler 
tube banks, and more specifically to a method and apparatus 
for removing the webbing or membrane material interposed 
between adjacent tubes of a continuous bank of 
boiler tubes and, optionally, substantially simultaneously 
beveling the tube ends in preparation for welding. Steam-generating boilers, such as those typically 
used at electrical power generating plants, are generally 
large steel or masonry structures containing hundreds 
of vertically arranged steel tubes which are in thermal 
contact with a burning fuel, such as coal. The burning 
fuel heats water circulated through the tubes. The heated 
water or steam is used to drive turbines which generate 
electricity. The tubes are generally arranged in large panels 
or banks of parallel tubes which are connected together 
with a metal membrane or web continuously interposed 
between each pair of adjacent tubes in the bank to form a 
tube wall. The tubes generally have an outer diameter 
which can range from about 1 inch up to about 3 inches, 
with a wall thickness which can be up to about 0.5 inch. 
The web or membrane connecting adjacent tubes to each 
other generally has a thickness about equal to the wall 
thickness of the tubes, with the width of the webbing 
generally ranging from about 0.25 inch to about 0.75 inch. 
The webs or membranes can be welded to the outer walls of 
adjacent tubes to form the tube banks; however, the tube 
and connecting membranes can be, and preferably are, 
formed together in a single casting operation. On account of deterioration due to corrosion and  
 
the like, the tubes occasionally require replacement. 
Ordinarily, repair of damaged or worn tubing involves 
cutting and removal of relatively large sections of the 
tube banks, and replacement with a new panel of tubes. 
The bank sections are generally replaced in large rectangular 
sections typically having sides ranging from a few 
feet to over 10 or even 20 feet in length. The sections of tube banks which are to be 
replaced are generally cut out using a power saw or a 
cutting torch. A preferred method and apparatus for 
cutting out a section of boiler tube wall is illustrated 
and described in U.S. Patent No. 5,033,347. After the damaged or worn section of tube wall 
which is to be replaced has been cut out and removed, it 
is necessary to properly prepare the tube ends exposed by 
removal of the old section before positioning the new tube 
bank section in the tube wall opening. Proper preparation 
of the
