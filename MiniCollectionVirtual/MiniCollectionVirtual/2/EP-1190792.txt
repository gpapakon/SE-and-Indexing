<ABSTRACT>
In a headstock guide unit for a machine tool in
which a carriage with a tool post mounted thereon is

provided on a fixed bed on one side thereof nearer to an
operator, and in which a headstock is provided on the other

side of the fixed bed farther from the operator, wherein
the headstock is fixed to a headstock base, the headstock

being movable between a workpiece machining position for
machining a workpiece on one side farther from the operator

and a workpiece loading/unloading position for loading or
unloading the workpiece on the other side nearer to the

operator, and a chip collecting recessed portion is
provided by cutting out a portion of the fixed bed

corresponding to the workpiece loading/unloading position,
and wherein rails are fixedly placed at left-and-right edge

portions of the chip collecting recessed portion, and
guides which are to be slidably engaged with the rails are

fixed on the headstock base. Thus, the headstock guide
unit for a machine tool allows the workpiece

loading/unloading work to be easily achieved, and allows
the support strength and support rigidity in supporting the

headstock on its one side at the workpiece
loading/unloading position to be ensured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a headstock
guide unit for a machine tool in which a carriage with a
tool post mounted thereon is disposed on a fixed bed on one
side thereof nearer to an operator while a headstock for
loading a workpiece thereon is provided on the other side
of the fixed bed farther from the operator.From DE-A-4 441 106 there is known a
headstock guide unit for a machine tool in which a carriage with a tool post
mounted thereon is provided on a fixed bed on one side thereof nearer to an
operator, and in which a headstock is provided on the other side of the fixed bed
farther from the operator, wherein the headstock is fixed to a
headstock base, the headstock base and the headstock being
moveable between a workpiece machining position for machining a workpiece on
one side farther from the operator and a workpiece loading/unloading position for
loading or unloading the workpiece on the other side nearer to the operator,
and wherein a chip collecting space is provided by cutting out
a portion, the headstock guide unit further comprising a guide support
mechanism for supporting, by the fixed bed, a front portion of the headstock base
on which the headstock is mounted when the headstock base is positioned at the
workpiece machining position, and supporting, by the fixed bed, a rear portion of
the headstock base when the headstock base is positioned at the workpiece
loading/unloading position.As an example, there has conventionally been
provided a mass-production type machine tool (NC lathe) in
which carriages each with a tool post mounted thereon are
provided left and right on one side of the fixed bed nearer
to the operator, as viewed from the operator so as to be
movable in X- and Z-axis directions, respectively, while a
headstock is fixedly provided on the farther side from the
operator between the two tool posts.With this type of NC lathe, a workpiece is
mounted on the spindle of the headstock, the workpiece is
subjected to a specified cutting process by moving the
left-and-right carriages and the tool post relative to each
other while keeping the workpiece driven into rotation.With this conventional machine tool, because of
its adoption of the structure that the headstock is fixedly  
set on the rear side of the left-and-right tool posts, the
work of replacing the workpiece of the spindle would
inevitably be performed on the deep side of the fixed bed,
resulting in a problem of poor workability.Also in this conventional machine tool, there are
some cases where chips generated by the

<CLAIMS>
A headstock guide unit for a machine tool in which a carriage (5) with a tool post (6)
mounted thereon is provided on a fixed bed (4) on one side thereof nearer to an

operator, and in which a headstock (7) is provided on the other side of the fixed bed (4)
farther from the operator, wherein the headstock (7) is fixed to a front portion of an

oblong shaped headstock base (16), the headstock base (16) and the headstock (7) being
moveable between a workpiece machining position for machining a workpiece on

one side farther from the operator and a workpiece loading/unloading position for
loading or unloading the workpiece on the other side nearer to the operator and

the front portion is overhung from the fixed bed (4) toward, the operator side when
the headstock (7) has advanced to the workpiece loading/unloading position, and a

rear portion of the headstock base (16) extends rearwardly from the fixed bed (4) so as to
protrude therefrom, and wherein a chip collecting space is provided by cutting out

a portion, the headstock guide unit further comprising a guide support
mechanism for supporting, by the fixed bed (4), a front portion of the headstock base (16)

on which the headstock (7) is mounted when the headstock base (16) is positioned at the
workpiece machining position, and supporting, by the fixed bed (4), a rear portion of

the headstock base when the headstock base is positioned at the workpiece
loading/unloading position. 
The headstock guide unit for a machine tool
according to Claim 1, wherein the guide support mechanism

comprises: rails fixedly placed so as to extend along left-and-right
edge portions of the chip collecting space of the 

fixed bed (4); and guides fixed on the headstock base (16) and
slidably engaged with the rails.
The headstock guide unit for a machine tool
according to Claim 1, wherein the guide support mechanism

comprises: a cam follower which is provided on the fixed
bed (4) and which makes rolling contact with a front lower

surface of the headstock base (16); and a second cam follower
which is provided at a rear portion of the fixed bed, rear

of the first cam follower, and which makes rolling contact
with a rear upper surface of the headstock base (16).
