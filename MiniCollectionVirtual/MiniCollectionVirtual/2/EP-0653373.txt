chain (20) with a plurality of axles is provided 

comprising a lower step (42) attached to an axle (66) of 
the step chain, a higher step (48) attached to an axle 

(78) of the step chain and having a middle section (52), 
and apparatus for actuating the middle section. The

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to escalators in general,
and to step platforms for handicap adapted escalators in
particular.Escalators and elevators are two of the most
popular means for moving pedestrian traffic from a first
elevation to a second elevation. Elevators are
typically used when the rise is greater than two floors,
and the passenger volume light to moderate. Escalators,
in contrast, are typically used when the rise is three
floors or less and the passenger volume moderate to
heavy. It is very common today for existing buildings
to have both escalators and elevators, thereby
capitalizing on the advantages of both.Historically, handicapped pedestrian traffic has
been limited to elevators because of the inability of
escalators to accept handicapped passengers, in
particular those in wheelchairs. Handicap access in
existing buildings has been provided, therefore, by
having either elevators alone or both escalators and
elevators. Today, however, the trend in almost all
types of buildings is towards less expensive two and
three story buildings which can be operated more
efficiently. The cost of installation and maintenance,
coupled with the unrentable occupied space, make
providing both escalators and elevators a less popular 
option than in the past. Passenger traffic and handicap
access must still be satisfied, however.Prior art document DE-A-4220803 discloses a step
platform for an escalator having a step chain, with a
plurality of axles, travelling a circuitous path between
a lower landing and an upper landing, passing through an
inclined section extending therebetween, comprising:
a lower step, attached to an axle of the step
chain;a higher step, attached to an axle of the step
chain, having a middle section which includes a
lowerable top and a riser; andmeans for actuating the movement of said middle
section.The present invention is characterised over DE-A-4220803
in that said actuating means is operated by the
rotation of the step chain axles in the transition zones
between the landings and the inclined midsection.In a preferred form of the present invention, the
said actuating means comprises a first actuator that is
operated by the rotation of the axle attached to said
lower step in the transition zones between the landings
and the inclined midsection, and a second actuator that
is operated by the rotation of the axle attached to the
higher step in the transition zones between the landings
and the inclined midsection.According to another preferred feature of the
present invention, means for

section top (84) in the same plane as said main body

top.
A step platform (12) according to claim 1 or 2,
said means (54) for actuating the movement of said

middle section comprising a first actuator (100) for
actuating the movement of said middle section, wherein

said first actuator is operated by the rotation of the
step chain axle (66) attached to said lower step in the

transition zones between the landings and the inclined
midsection.
A step platform according to claim 3, wherein said
first actuator (100) comprises:


an arm (104), having a length, fixed to the step 
axle (66) connected to said lower step (42); and
a cable (106), extending between, and attached to,
said arm and said middle section of said higher step;
wherein said arm rotates with the step axle
connected to the lower step in the transition zones

between the landings and the inclined midsection,
thereby causing said cable to be one of either payed out

or taken in relative to said middle section.
A step platform according to claim 3 or 4, said
means (54) for actuating movement of said middle section

further comprising:

a second actuator (102) for actuating the movement
of said middle section (52), wherein said second

actuator is operated by the rotation of the step chain
