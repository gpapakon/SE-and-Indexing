<ABSTRACT>
A user adaptive system in a computer system 
executing an application program includes a storage area 

(132, 142) for storing therein a data structure corresponding 
to a combination of setting values of parameters 

to be set arbitrarily by a user for a job to be 
executed in the application program, a storage area 

(133, 143) for updating, each time a parameter setting 
operation is conducted by the user, the structure corresponding 

thereto, and a storage area operative, when a 
value of the data structure exceeds a threshold value, 

for registering a combination of setting values of 
parameters associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a user
adaptive system in which usability of the user's
operation is improved according to functions of
application programs operating in a computer, and in
particular, to an adaptive method in which there is
extracted a combination of setting values of parameters
frequently used in a function by an individual user so
as to register a combination of setting values matching
the user's preference.Heretofore, as a method of improving usability
of user's operation in accordance with functions of
application programs operating in a computer, there has
been known a method of re-arranging candidate character
strings in a kana (Japanese syllabary)/kanji (Chinese
character) conversion of a word processor. For example,
in a kanji term input apparatus described in the JP-B-57-32366,
the re-arrangement is accomplished according
to a utilization frequency; whereas, in a Japanese
sentence input apparatus described in the JP-B-58-39334,
the re-arrangement is carried out with precedence
assigned to a last used term, namely, a kanji or an
idiom previously used.However, these methods of re-arranging
candidate character strings have been devised in 
consideration only of a setting item, namely, a
character string currently being converted. Namely, in
these methods, there has not been considered a case
where there exist many values to be set and these values
exert influences upon each other. In such a case where
the values are mutually influenced from each other, when
a setting operation is conducted, other setting
conditions are resultantly varied.To set the values which exert influences upon
each other to desired values, each setting value is to
be slightly altered in a step-by-step manner while
checking the overall setting state, namely, there is
required quite a troublesome operation as disclosed in US-A-5 191 643.In this situation, according to the graphics
user interface employed in personal computers, there is
used a method in which the previously set values are
memorized. Consequently, it becomes unnecessary to
achieve the tedious operation to set the values again.According to the method in which the
previously set values are memorized as described in CREATIVE LABS, INC "Sound Blaster 16 User Reference Manual", 1992, MILPITAS, CALIFORNIA, when a setting
operation is achieved in a similar fashion to that of
the preceding operation, the human power will be saved.
However, when these operations are different from each
other, the troublesome operation is required to be
carried out

<CLAIMS>
A user adaptive system for use in a computer system executing an application
program, comprising:


means (132, 142) for storing a data structure, represented by a matrix
corresponding to combinations of selectable setting values of parameters

including their respective selection frequencies, for a job to be executed in
the application program (Figs. 3, 4, 5A, and 5B); and
means (133,143) for updating the data structure correspondingly
each time a user selects a setting value by a group of radio buttons (211-214)

in a setting window (200);

   
characterised by
 means operative, when the selection frequency for a
particular combination of setting values exceeds a predetermined threshold

value, for automatically registering this particular combination of setting values into storing
means (134,144) and for assigning a newly generated button (240, 250)

to select this combination.
A user adaptive method for use in a computer system executing an
application program, comprising the steps of:


storing a data structure, represented by a matrix corresponding to
combinations of selectable setting values of parameters including their respective

selection frequencies, for a job to be executed in the application
program,
providing a group of radio buttons (211 - 214) in a setting window
(200) for selecting said setting values, and
updating the data structure correspondingly each tune the user
selects a setting value,
 
   
characterised in that
, when the selection frequency for a particular
combination of setting values exceeds a predetermined threshold value, this

particular combination of setting values is automatically registered into storing means
(134, 144), wherein a newly generated button (240, 250) is assigned to select

this combination.
The method of claim 2, further comprising
the steps of:


subdividing a setting range for variable parameters in appropriate intervals
(232 - 236),
assigning setting values to each interval, wherein the setting values
are continuously to be selected by operating a slide bar (231) with a mouse

(120);
treating the setting values selectable by the slide bar as a set; and
assigning a dimension of a matrix for each set. (Fig. 6)
The method of claim 2, further comprising
the steps of
:

subdividing a setting range for variable parameters in appropriate intervals,
assigning setting values to each interval, whereby the setting values
are to be selected by a keyboard (150) when an input character string (221)

is an integer;
treating the setting values selectable by keyboard as a set; and
assigning a dimension of a matrix for each set. (Fig. 6)
The method of any one of claims 2 to 4, further comprising the step of
 
   updating a matrix element (400,500) associated with the selected

combination of setting values when updating the matrix.
The method of any one of claims 2 to 5, wherein:

the job is a wipe function of a video processing; and
the setting of values for parameters include the setting of a transition
time, a frame interval and/or a wipe pattern. (Fig. 9).
