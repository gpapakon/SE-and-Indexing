<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to growth factors and
neurotrophic factors, and more particularly to a soluble growth
factor with dorsal growth inducing activity, to complexes including
the factor, and to DNA or RNA coding sequences for the factor.This invention was made, in part, with government support
under Grant Contract No. ROI-GM-42341, awarded by the National
Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this
invention.Growth factors are substances, such as polypeptide hormones,
which affect the growth of defined populations of animal cells in
vivo or in vitro, but which are not nutrient substances. Proteins
involved in
the growth and differentiation of tissues may promote or inhibit
growth, and promote or inhibit differentiation, and thus the general
term "growth factor" includes cytokines and trophic factors. Among
growth, or neurotrophic factors presently known are those that can
be classified into the insulin family [insulin, insulin-like growth 
factors (e.g., IGF-I, IGF-II), mammary stimulating factor (MSF), and
nerve growth factor (NGF)]; those classified into the epidermal
growth factor family [epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
transforming growth factors (TGFα, TGFβ, TGFγ)]; those classified
into the platelet-derived growth factor family [platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), osteosarcoma-derived growth factor (ODGF),
and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)]; the neurotrophins [nerve growth
factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF)
neurotrophins 3, 4, 5, (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5)]; and others [colony
stimulating factor (CSF), T-cell growth factor, tumor angiogenesis
factor (TAF), DNA synthesis promoting factor (DSF), tumor-derived
growth factors, fibroblast-derived growth factor (FDGF)].Receptors that affect growth (that is, receptors for growth-associated
ligands) are proteins found associated with cell
surfaces that specifically bind their growth factors as ligands.
Growth factor receptors are utilized in various clinical and
diagnostic applications.U.S. Patent 4,857,637, issued August 15, 1989, inventors
Hammonds et al., describes a method for immunizing an animal
against its growth hormone receptor through use of vaccinating with
antibodies in order to stimulate growth of the animals.U.S. Patent 4,933,294, issued June 12, 1990, inventors
Waterfield et al., describes studies of structural alterations of the
human EGF receptor and its gene and a relationship in tumorigenesis
for assays and therapies involving the human EGF receptor. For
example, such assays can involve
