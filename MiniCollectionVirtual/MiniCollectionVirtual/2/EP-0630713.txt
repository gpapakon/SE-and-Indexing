<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composite body made from materials with different thermal and mechanical properties. At the top, the composite body (1) has a wear-resistant sintered carbide body (2) which is embedded in a zone consisting of a ductile alloy with a low coefficient of thermal expansion in such a way that only its top part protrudes. The ductile zone (3) is encased by a main body (4) which preferably consists of a high-strength hardened and tempered steel. The sintered carbide body (2), the ductile zone (3) and the main body (4) are joined together to form the composite body (1) in accordance with the invention by hot isostatic pressing. The advantages achieved by means of the invention consist, in particular, in that it provides a composite body (1) with low residual stresses which keeps down or reduces thermal stresses in the composite system, allows improved force transmission and is considerably less prone to fracture than comparable commercially available bodies.
