<ABSTRACT>
A water-free, water-reducible primer composition 
having a volatile organic content of less than 0.36 g/m 

yields a tough, flexible, and weatherable film when applied 
to metal or plastic substrates. The base resin is a 

polyester having an acid number of from 50 to 60 and a 
hydroxyl number of from 160 to 200. The polyester is the 

reaction product of from 0.45 to 0.5 mole % of adipic acid, 
from 0.35 to 0.4 mole % of neopentyl glycol, and from 0.15 

to 0.2 mole % of trimethylolpropane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water reducible polyester and to
a water-free, water reducible coating composition comprising it
which provides a flexible, weatherable primer. It relates more
particularly to a coating composition which has a significantly
lower volatile organic content (VOC) than those which are currently
available commercially. It relates also to a method for applying
a water-reducible primer composition as a water-reduced composition
having a spraying viscosity.Environmental concerns during the past decade and more have
caused many governing bodies to issue regulations limiting the VOC
of coating compositions. In response to these regulations, the
coating industry has turned to powder coating formulations which
contain essentially no volatile organic compounds and to water-based
coating compositions. Because of the corrosive nature of
water-based compositions, they must be shipped in plastic
containers or in specially coated steel containers. Special
equipment such as stainless steel tanks, lines, and spraying
apparatus must also be used. The typical commercially available
solvent-borne coating compositions have a VOC of about 600g/l (5.0 pounds
per US gallon) or more. While it would be desirable to lower the VOC
of such compositions for environmental reasons, the practical
difficulty is that the viscosity would be generally too high for
easy applicability to a chosen substrate.Modern automobiles use significant and increasing amounts of
plastic and elastomeric components and thus the demand for coatings 
having a high degree of elasticity, toughness, and weatherability
has been increasing steadily. Poly (ester-urethane) polyol resins
when cured with an aminoplast provide suitable elastomeric coatings
but these are expensive. Polyester resin compositions may also be
cured with an aminoplast to yield coatings but their elasticity and
weatherability generally have not been satisfactory. The
formulation of polyester resin coating compositions having the
demanded properties is made significantly more difficult when the
polyester must also have properties which allow it to be shipped
and pumped in a water-free state but readily reducible with water
to a sprayable viscosity at the point of use.JP-A-5039457 discloses an aqueous polyester resin
dispersion for use as a coating composition for metal
surfaces, having a solid acid value of 5 to 20 and a solid
hydroxyl value of 40 to 200. An exemplified composition is
prepared from 195 wt. parts of isophthalic acid, 264 wt.parts
of adipic acid, 60
