<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to novel herbicidal 2-[(4-heterocyclic-substituted-3-halophenoxymethyl)phenoxy]alkanoates,
especially propionates and acetates, and
their use for weed control in agriculture, horticulture,
and other fields in which it is desired to
control unwanted plant growth, such as grassy or broadleaf
plant species. In particular, it pertains to
those compounds in which the heterocyclic moiety is
selected from among 4-difluoromethyl-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-1,2,4-triazol-5(1H)-on-1-yl,
3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimid-1-yl,
1-(1-methylethyl)imidazolidin-2,4-dion-3-yl,
1,4-dihydro-4-(3-fluoropropyl)-5H-tetrazol-5-on-1-yl,
3-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindazol-2-yl, 4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5-dion-2-yl,
8-thia-1,6-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane-7-on-9-ylimino,
and 1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-2,4-pyrimidinedione-3-yl
groups.
These compounds are both pre- and postemergence herbicides.
The use of this class of compounds as herbicides
has not previously been described.U.S. 5,084,085 discloses compounds of the formula:
 
wherein
Rais preferably lower haloalkyl, and Rb is
preferably lower alkyl;R' and R2are broadly defined;X and Yare independently halogen, alkyl, alkoxy,
alkylthio, haloalkyl, nitro, cyano, sulfonylalkyl,
or -SOCF3;Mis CH or N; andAis a derivative of an alkanoate bonded to the
phenoxy oxygen at the alpha carbon.U.S. 4,816,065 discloses compounds like those of
U.S. 5,084,085, except that the triazolinone ring has
been replaced by a 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimido
moiety. Similarly, U.S. 4,885,025 discloses compounds
in which the triazolinone ring of U.S. 5,084,085 has
been replaced with a tetrazolinone moiety.U.S. 3,984,434, Japanese patents 54-25018, 54-26534,
and 60-39668, and Japanese patent applications
49-000432 and 54-19965, all assigned to Mitsubishi
Chemical Industries, Ltd., disclose compounds of the
general formula:

wherein
Xis hydrogen, halogen, nitro, alkyl, or alkoxy,Yis hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, and n and m are each
1 to 4.It has now been found that 2-[(4-heterocyclic-substituted-3-halophenoxymethyl)phenoxy]alkanoates
are
unexpectedly active as both pre- and postemergence
herbicides. In particular, as preemergence herbicides
many of these compounds exhibit tolerance of soybeans 
and, to a certain extent, of corn. Perhaps of greater
interest is the postemergence activity, where no crop
tolerance is exhibited, making them excellent candidates
as total vegetation control agents.The novel 2-[(4-heterocyclic-substituted-3-halophenoxymethyl)phenoxy]alkanoates
of the present
invention are
