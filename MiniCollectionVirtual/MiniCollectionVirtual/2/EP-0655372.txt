<ABSTRACT>
The belt retractor for vehicle safety belts is provided with a belt reel (12) which is rotatably mounted in a casing (10), a locking mechanism (28) for locking rotation of the belt reel and a release mechanism (18) which has a plate cam (16) which can be rotated to a limited extent with respect to the belt reel (12) and the rotation of which with respect to the belt reel (12) causes the locking mechanism to become activated. A switching rocker (40) having two actuating arms (40a, 40b) and a catch (40c) can be switched between two stable switching positions. In the first switching position it actuates the locking mechanism (28) while in the second position it releases the locking mechanism (28). A planetary gearing includes a sun wheel (30) which is connected to the belt reel (12) in a non-rotating manner, a hollow wheel (31) which is fixed to the casing and two planet wheels (32, 34) which each have an external toothing and are engaged with the sun wheel (30) and with the hollow wheel (31). The catch (40c) engages in the first switching position on the plate cam (16) and holds it so that it cannot rotate. The external toothing of the planet wheels (32, 34) each have a ratchet tooth which protrudes in a radial direction, comes into direct engagement with one of the actuating arms of the switching rocker (40) in a certain circulating and rotating position of the appropriate planet wheel (32a, 34a) and presses the switching locker into its other switching position in each case.

A belt retractor for a vehicle safety belt, comprising 

a) a belt drum (12) mounted for rotation in a housing (10); 
b) a locking mechanism (28) for locking rotation of the belt 
drum; 
c) an actuating mechanism (18), which possesses a control 
disk (16) able to turn to a limited extent in relation to 

the belt drum (12) and by whose rotation in relation to the 
belt drum (12) the locking mechanism can be activated; 
d) a switching element (40), which is able to be switched 
over between two stable switching positions so that in the 

first switching position it activates the locking mechanism 
(28) whereas in the second position it releases the locking 

mechanism (28); 
e) a planet wheel gearing means, with a sun wheel (30) secured 
in such a manner as to prevent relative rotation to 

the belt drum (12), a ring gear (31) secured to the housing, 
and at least one planet wheel (32, 34) which possesses 

external teeth and is in mesh with the sun wheel (30) and 
with the ring gear (31); 
  
 

characterized in that the switching element is designed in 
the form of a pivotally mounted rocker (40) which possesses 

two actuating arms (40a, 40b) and a switching pawl (40c), 
which in the first switching position acts on the control 

disk (16) and holds the same preventing rotation, and the 
external teeth of the planet wheel (32, 34) comprise at 

least one actuating tooth (32a, 34a) which is oversize in 
the radial direction and which in a predetermined position 

of orbiting movement and rotation of the planet wheel (32, 
34) comes into direct engagement with one of the actuating 

arms of the switching rocker (40) and pushes the same into 
its respective other switching position. 
The belt retractor as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that two planet wheels (32, 34), which are offset in 

relation to one another in the peripheral direction, are 
each provided with a switching tooth (32a, 34a), a first one 

(32) of the planet wheels coming into engagement with the 
one actuating arm (40a) of the switching rocker (40) in a 

predetermined position of orbiting movement and rotation and 
the second one (34) coming into engagement with the other 

actuating arm (40b) of the switching rocker (40) in a 
different position of orbiting movement and rotation. 
The belt retractor as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2, 
characterized in that after each complete orbit the rotational 

position of the switching tooth (32a, 34a) on the 
planet wheel (32, 34) is offset by the size of the pitch of 

its teeth or a multiple thereof.
