<ABSTRACT>
Telecommunication systems (1) such as PABXs are known which 
comprise ISDN digital linecards (4, 5, 6) with a number of ISDN basic access 

interfaces (20, 21). A telecommunication device (1) is proposed comprising configurable 
ISDN digital linecards (4, 5, 6). To this end the linecards (4, 5, 6) are provided with 

configuration means for independently configuring each ISDN basic access interface 
(20, 21) with respect to the other ISDN basic access interfaces (20, 21) as to mode 

setting and phantom power feeding to the transmission line (7, 9) to be coupled to the 
interface 

(20, 21). The modes to be set are ISDN-NT or ISDN-TE mode. It is achieved that the 
PABX (1) can be set to customer specifications without customer specific linecards 

(4, 5, 6) having to be manufactured. Accordingly, no high manufacturing change-over 
costs are involved and no expensive extra documentation sets have to be drawn up, as 

would have been the case when many customer specific linecards (4, 5, 6) would have 
to be manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunication system comprising a 
linecard with at least one ISDN basic access interface for coupling the 
telecommunication device to at least one ISDN supported device or to an ISDN network 
via a four-wire transmission line. The present invention further relates to a linecard for use in such a 
telecommunication device. A telecommunication system of this kind is known from an article 
"Communication system for the parliament of Northrhine-Westfalia (Landtag NRW)", 
H. Friedel, J. Wiegand, Philips TDS Review, Vol. 46, No. 1, March 1988, pp. 1-13. 
In this article an ISDN-compatible (Integrated Services Digital Network) PABX (Private 
Automatic Branch Exchange) is disclosed with stored-program control and digital 
switching, which can be used both in analog and digital switching, its capacity ranging 
from 200-20,000 extensions. The digital communication is based on a procedure 
recommended by the CCITT, an ISDN Basic Rate Access 2B+D, two B-channels for 
user information, 2 times 64 kbit/s digital speech and data, and one D-channel for 
signalling or user data, 16 kbit/s, with a netto rate of 144 kbit/s and a bruto rate of 192 
kbit/s, and an ISDN Primary Rate Access 30B+D, with a rate of 2048 kbit/s. 
Physically, the 2B+D and 30B+D form a single link, i.e. the 2B+D and 30B+D 
channels are multiplexed, but logically, from a user point of view, these channels are 
totally independent of each other. The PABX communicates with ISDN telephone sets, 
PCs etc. via ISDN basic access interfaces at 192 kbit/s (Basic Rate Access), and may 
communicate at the higher 2048 kbit/s with larger computer systems, with other 
PABXs, with the public ISDN etc. The PABX may also communicate with other 
PABXs or the public ISDN at Basic Rate. Communication can be point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint, possibly via a LAN (Local Area Network). The PABX may also 
comprise analog interfaces for communicating with the PSTN or with analog telephone  
 
sets via a Terminal Adapter, adapting analog devices to ISDN interface. The basic 
access interface has the following OSI-model layer 1 characteristics: four-wire 
transmission line with phantom power feeding, 192 kbit/s (2B+D, contention 
resolution, and transmission overhead), point-to-point or multipoint/passive Sâ‚€-bus, AMI 
(Alternate Mark Inversion) or ternary line code. Further details concerning ISDN and ISDN user-network interfaces can be 
found in the CCITT 'Blue Book', Vol. III -Fascicle III-8, Recommendations I.310-I.470,
