<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining electric discharge 
machining conditions comprises the steps of establishing 

multiple sets of predefined machining parameters, 
establishing for each set of predefined machining 

parameters a set of basic machining data indicating 
relationships present during electric discharge machining 

among electric discharge machining current, machining 
depth and minimum electrode side surface undersize, 

selecting at least two sets of basic machining data from 
among the multiple sets thereof in accordance with a given 

set of predefined machining parameters, and inferring and 
generating machining condition data representing a series 

of pairs of machining depth values and corresponding 
electric discharge machining current values required for 

machining the workpiece to a prescribed configuration and 
dimensions, the electric discharge machining current 

values in the series progressively changing with 
increasing machining depth value from a value larger than 

the electric discharge machining current value of the 
selected set of basic machining data to a value smaller 

than the electric discharge machining current value of the 
selected set of basic machining data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
determining the optimum electric discharge machining 
conditions for a machining electrode and a workpiece based 
on predefined machining parameters, and an electric 
discharge machining controller. Since the electrode used in electric discharge 
machining machines an area larger than itself (machining 
overcut), the machining is conducted using an undersized 
electrode fabricated to a smaller size than that of the 
machining dimensions required by the workpiece. As 
electric discharge machining is more time consuming than 
other machining methods, moreover, it is generally divided 
into a number of stages between roughing and finishing so 
as to increase the machining efficiency. In the first 
stage, machining is conducted under rough conditions for 
approximately obtaining the desired machined 
configuration. This is known as roughing. In the next 
stage or stages, called semifinishing, the machining 
current is reduced and relative movement is applied 
between the electrode and the workpiece. Finally, 
finishing is conducted to obtain the required machining  
 
dimensions and degree of machined surface roughness. In 
determining the roughing conditions in the initial 
roughing stage, the operator adopts the maximum machining 
electric current allowable in light of the electrode 
undersize, machining depth and machining area, and then 
also decides, with reference to a data book or the like, 
the machining depth and the stock to be left for finishing 
and required for obtaining the final desired surface 
roughness. Among the machining conditions that come into 
play during roughing, the machining current has the 
strongest influence on the electric discharge machining 
overcut and the finishing allowance left for subsequent 
finishing. The roughing conditions are therefore greatly 
affected by the amount of electrode undersize. This is 
because the maximum current usable in roughing is 
determined almost entirely by the electrode undersize. 
Therefore, after calculating the maximum permissible 
machining current from the machining area, the operator 
checks whether the electrode undersize is sufficiently 
greater than the machining overcut that can be expected at 
the calculated machining current value. If it is, he 
conducts the roughing using machining conditions based on 
the calculated value. If it is smaller than the expected 
machining overcut, he refers to a data book and selects 
machining conditions for obtaining a machining overcut 
that is smaller than
