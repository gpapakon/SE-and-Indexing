<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for increasing the strength of a mechanical pulp for paper or paperboard production. Mechanical pulp, such as ground wood pulp, refined mechanical pulp, 
thermomechanical pulp, etc. is generally produced by grinding logs or chips in a 
grinder or refiner where the temperature increases to near or above boiling. The 
three main constituents of the pulp are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. From these types of pulp, paper or paperboard is generally 
manufactured as follows: The pulp is treated in a screening process, is mixed with paper or 
paperboard making additives in the stock preparation section in order to prepare 
the paper or paperboard furnish. A paper or paperboard is then made from the 
furnish on a paper machine. The mechanical pulps have an advantage of providing high yield but 
on the other hand they have inferior strength properties compared to chemical 
pulps. High paper strength is generally desirable. Conventional methods for 
increasing the paper strength include the use of wet strength additives and binders. EP-A1-0 433 258 discloses a process for the production of mechanical 
pulp from a fibrous product wherein the fibrous product is subjected to an enzymatic 
treatment in which a binding agent is linked with the lignin in the fibrous product. The 
binding agent may be a hydrophilic substance, particularly a protein or a 
carbohydrate, e.g., oxidized, medium cationic starch. The enzymatic treatment may 
be done with a laccase.  
 US-A-4 687 745 discloses a process for enhancing the strength 
properties of mechanical pulps. The process uses ligninolytic enzymes present in the 
extracellular growth medium of a fermentation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium.EP-A-0 429,422 discloses reduction of energy consumption in the refining 
stages by use of laccase during pulp preparation between the first and second 
refining stage; the document indicates that some increase of paper strength is also 
obtained. However, the enzyme treatment is done at 20°C, so this prior-art process 
requires an extra cooling stage after the first refining step. We have found that, surprisingly, the strength of the paper of 
paperboard can be increased by treating the pulp with a phenol-oxidizing enzyme 
system different from that disclosed in said US-A-4 687 745 (e.g. laccase and oxygen) after the mechanical refining. It is believed that this 
strengthening is due to polymerization or cross-linking of the lignin present at the 
surface of the fibers. Accordingly, the invention
