<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a hydrocephalus valve is designed as a double valve whose part-valves respond to different pressure differences such as occur in human subjects as a function of whether the latter stands upright or lies down. The part-valves can operate independently of one another, in which case the second part-valve opens additionally to the first one at a higher response threshold, or the part-valves operate in alternating fashion, in which case the first part-valve is closed after the second part-valve is opened.
