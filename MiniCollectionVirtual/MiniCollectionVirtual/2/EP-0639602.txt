<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of linear polyesters having improved whiteness and a low yellowness index by esterification of aromatic dicarboxylic acids or transesterification of bis(lower alkyl) esters thereof, and optionally aliphatic dicarboxylic acids by means of diols to give bis diol esters and oligomers thereof, and further condensation of these precursors to give spinnable polyesters, which is characterised in that from 0.5 to 15 % by weight of phosphorus-containing modifiers are added to the esterification, transesterification or polycondensation batch, and in that the polycondensation is carried out first in the melt to an IV of from 0.4 to 0.55 dl/g and then in the solid phase to an IV of 0.62 to 0.72 dl/g, where the IV values given relate to measurement at 25 DEG C in dichloroacetic acid. The phosphorus-containing modifiers condensed in are preferably those of the formula V or VI
