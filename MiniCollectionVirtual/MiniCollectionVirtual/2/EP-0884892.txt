<ABSTRACT>
An improved printer is provided which includes a series of analog delay
elements that operate at a very fast speed, and therefore, can be used in an

enhanced mode to further subdivide the slice clock to create a greater variety
of gray levels that can be used in continuous tone printing. By using this

enhanced mode of continuous tone printing, a full 
on
 slice can be
immediately preceded or followed by a partial slice, under the control of the

series of delay elements. The delay elements are automatically calibrated at
the beginning of each page to be printed by placing the delay line chain

circuit into a 
calibrate mode
, during which time a clock pulse is provided to
the delay line chain so that the chain is repeatedly tested, in increments of

one additional delay element at a time, to determine the number of delay
elements that are required to cause a time delay that is greater than or equal

to the period of the slice-based clock. Once that quantity is determined, the
calibrated delay elements will be used to print the entire next page to be

output from the laser printhead. As the printer desires various gray levels for
continuous tone printing, the number of whole slices and partial slices for a

particular pel or group of pels will be determined by the desired gray level,
and when a partial slice is to be printed, the printer will select the appropriate

number of delay elements that will be used to control a flip-flop that outputs
the 
video output
 signal to the laser printhead. When the asynchronous

reset
 input of the flip-flop has a control signal applied, the output of the flip-flop
will immediately change state to truncate the 
on time
 of the slice that
was currently being output to the laser printhead. By use of the

asynchronous reset flip-flop, the slice can be subdivided into smaller time
intervals, completely under the control of the delay line chain without regard

to the frequency or phase angle of the pel clock or the slice-based clock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to enhancing the number of gray
levels in printing equipment and is particularly directed to a printer of the type
which uses delay elements that essentially act as a higher speed clock. The
invention is specifically disclosed as an enhanced laser printer that provides a
group of in-series delay stages that are capable of subdividing the slice clock
pulse so as to create more gray levels than are otherwise available, and a
method for calibrating the amount of time delay introduced by each delay
stage.As print resolutions increase in electrophotographic-based printers, print
smoothing methods may have less effect on perceived print quality. As print
standards move closer to camera ready copy, EP printers are typically forced
to make a crucial tradeoff between image definition and smoothness. To
achieve a sharper more clearly defined image, each halftone cell must occupy
only a small absolute area, corresponding to a small grid of printed pels. To
achieve a smooth and gradual transition in gray levels, as are required for
lifelike fleshtones, each halftone cell must contain a high number of available
gray levels from which to choose. Additionally, for binary printing where one
bit of information represents a black or white pel, the user must choose
between image definition and smoothness.Multi-bit or continuous tone (contone) printing avoids the difficult tradeoff
between definition and smoothness by providing multiple levels of control per
printed pel. By allowing the image generation software to select multiple
intermediate levels, the number of printable gray levels in a given region is
greatly increased. For example, given a halftone cell comprised of a 4 x 4 
array of pels, seventeen levels of gray {(4*4) + 1 = 17} are possible, including
white and black. However, if each pel in this halftone cell can be further
divided into four subdivisions, then 65 levels of gray {(4*4*4) + 1 = 65} are
possible, and by providing more subdivisions per pel, the effective resolution
of the printer is increased.In an effort to increase perceived print resolution, printer hardware designs
have focused on methods to divide each printed pel into successively smaller
pieces called slices. The increase in division of the pels has typically been
achieved by increasing the frequency at which the slice-based clock runs,
thereby providing more slices per pel. This method is achievable for standard
ASIC silicon processes for 300 dpi printing and 600 dpi printing on slow to
medium
