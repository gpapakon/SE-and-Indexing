<ABSTRACT>
In known processing apparatus of the dip-and-dunk 
type, processing tanks are arranged in a 

predetermined order, and the material to be processed 
follows a predetermined sequence as a support on which 

the material is mounted is moved from the start to the 
end of the apparatus. Described herein is an improved 

photographic processing apparatus (100) comprising six 
processing tanks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) which are 

surrounded by a frame (7, 8, 9) carrying a carriage 
(14). The carriage (14) is moved along cross-member 

(9) which itself can be raised or lowered relative to 
upright elements (7, 8). Motors (10, 11) are operated 

by a controller (15) to control movement of the 
carriage (14) and the cross-member (9) using belts 

(12, 13) and hence the movement of material (16) 
through the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
photographic processing apparatus and is more 
particularly concerned with such apparatus having 
programmable control. Processing apparatus of the dip-and-dunk 
type are well known. They commonly consist of a 
series of deep processing tanks which are arranged in 
a predetermined order which is related to the 
photographic processing stages, ie developer, bleach, 
fix, wash, wash and wash. Such an apparatus is known from, e.g., US-A-4 575 209. Photographic material to be processed, 
either in the form of film or paper, is attached to a 
support so that it hangs vertically over the deep 
processing tanks. The support and any attached 
photographic material is mounted so that it can be 
progressed along the tank line starting at the 
developer stage and finishing with the washing stages. 
Some apparatus incorporate a dryer stage after the wet 
stages. In apparatus of the type described above, 
the material being processed has to follow a 
predetermined sequence as the support is moved from 
the start to the end of the machine. This does not 
allow the material to pass back to a previously 
visited processing stage. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide an improved processing machine in 
which the material being processed can be re-directed 
back to a previously visited processing stage.  
 In accordance with the present invention, 
there is provided photographic processing apparatus 
comprising a plurality of processing stages, and 
transporting means for transporting material to be 
processed through the apparatus and into each of the 
processing stages, characterized in that programmable 
control means are provided for controlling the 
transporting means so that the material to be 
processed can be directed to any processing stage and 
in any particular order in both a forward or backward 
direction. By this arrangement, it is possible for the 
material being processed to be processed more than 
once in a particular processing stage. Furthermore, the material being processed 
need not follow the conventional series of processing 
stages as discussed above. For a better understanding of the present 
invention, reference will now be made, by way of 
example only, to the accompanying drawing, the single 
Figure of which illustrates processing apparatus 
constructed in accordance with the present invention. Figure 1 illustrates a photographic 
processing machine 100. The machine comprises six 
processing tanks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged side-by-side

<CLAIMS>
Photographic processing apparatus (100) 
comprising a plurality of processing stages (1, 2, 3, 

4, 5, 6), and transporting means (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 
14) for transporting material (16) to be processed 

through the apparatus (100) and into each of the 
processing stages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), characterized in 

that programmable control means (15) are provided for 
controlling the transporting means (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 

14) so that the material (16) to be processed can be 
directed to any processing stage (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 

and in any particular order in both a forward or 
backward direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein 
the transporting means (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) is 

mounted on a frame (7, 8, 9) comprising at least a 
pair of upright elements (7, 8) which support a cross-member 

(9), the cross-member (9) being movable 
relative to the upright elements (7, 8) in a 

substantially vertical plane. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein 
the cross-member (9) carries a carriage member (14) to 

which the material (16) to be processed is attached, 
the carriage member (14) being movable relative to the 

cross-member (9) in a substantially horizontal plane. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 and 3, 
wherein the transporting means (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) 

includes at least one motor (10, 11) and at least one 
drive belt (12, 13) for effecting movement of the 

material (16) being processed under control of the 
control means (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein 
the cross-member (9) is connected to a motor (10) by 

means of a drive belt (12) to effect movement relative 
to the upright elements (7, 8).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein 
the carriage member (14) is connected to a motor (11) 

carried by the cross-member (9) by a drive belt (13) 
to effect movement relative to the cross-member (9).
