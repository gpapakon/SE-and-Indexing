<ABSTRACT>
A line frequency is determined by interleaved 
sampling of ambient light to obtain analog voltage 

samples at predetermined sampling rates associated with 
two or more line frequencies. Where there are two line 

frequencies, one method separates the first samples by a 
time period at least equal to an analog-to-digital 

conversion time, and less than the earliest time when a 
sample associated with one line frequency would coincide 

with a sample from the other. There are n samples per 
flicker frequency period and Q samples for each line 

frequency are taken. In a second method, a first common 
sample is taken for all line frequencies, and a 

condition characterized by simultaneous samples for 
different line frequency sample groups triggers a common 

sample for all line frequencies. For both methods, 
digital sample values one through Q-1 for each group are 

operated on to obtain a result, and then two through Q 
are similarly operated on to obtain a second result. The 

result for samples one through Q-1 for a given line 
frequency is compared to the result for samples two 

through Q. If the results for a given line frequency are 
within a predetermined limit, the presence of that line 

frequency is indicated. The known line frequency can be 
used to set the light sampling rate for exposure 

setting, as well as imprinting light source information 
onto photographic film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
determining line frequency. More particularly, the
present invention relates to determining a line
frequency presence and detecting a variable frequency
artificial light source.In the past, various illuminant discrimination
techniques have been used to determine the type of
lighting present, for example, in a photographic
scene. This information is useful to the photo
developer for proper color correction, since
different types of lighting cause different tinting
of photos. Illuminant discrimination techniques
exist not only to determine whether the light source
is either natural or artificial, but also to
determine among various types of artificial light,
such as tungsten and fluorescent. If the lighting is
artificial, the accuracy of these illuminant
discrimination techniques may be adversely affected
if the light samples are taken at a rate different
from the line frequency of the artificial light
source. Since line frequencies differ among
countries, accuracy in the use of these artificial
light discrimination techniques may be affected when
traveling between countries.From US-A-5 239 369 a device is known in
which the problem of different line frequencies is discussed.
A device is disclosed for correction of flicker due to the
line frequency. However, to actual measurement of the frequency
is performed, which is considered known. Knowing the line frequency of an artificial
light source would also be helpful in exposure
setting techniques for cameras. If the line
frequency is different from the light sampling rate
for determining the correct exposure setting, light
flickering can cause a light sample to be improperly
interpreted, leading to an improper exposure setting.
Thus, if the line frequency were known, light samples
could be taken at the line frequency to avoid
improper exposure due to flickering.Thus, a need exists for determining a line
frequency and a presence of a variable frequency
artificial light source.Briefly, the present invention satisfies the
need to determine line frequency and the presence of
artificial light sources by providing line frequency
determination methods and apparatus, as well as
further uses for the determined line frequency.A first method is provided for determining the
presence of a line frequency from a group of possible
line frequencies in a light source as defined in claim 1. The group of possible line
frequencies includes a first line frequency having an
associated first flicker frequency period and a
second line
