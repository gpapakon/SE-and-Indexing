<ABSTRACT>
A non-destructive testing equipment comprises a magnetic sensor (3) 
located within a magnetic shield container (4). The magnetic sensor 

(3) includes 
a SQUID that is a magnetic sensor having a very high sensitivity. A 

magnetically uniform inspection zone is formed in the magnetic shield 
container. While a rod-like material to be tested passes through the 

inspection zone at a uniform velocity, the magnetic sensor can detect an 
appreciable magnetic field variation that is caused by impurities or 

minor defects contained in the object to be tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-destructive testing
equipment having a SQUID type magnetic sensor. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a new
magnetic testing equipment which can continually detect
impurities or defects contained in an object to be tested,
which high sensitivity.Wire-rod materials such as optical fibers, cables and
wires, and plate-like metal or ceramics materials which can
be used for a body of aircraft or spacecrafts and
satellites, have an extremely large length or a large area.
On the other hands, extremely small impurities of slight
defects included in these materials will results in serious
troubles and damages. Therefore, severe quality control has
been required for these materials.In turn, in signal cables composed of signal conductors,
insulators and tensile strength members in combination,
individual component parts can be tested before the
component parts are assembled to a cable. However, there is 
no method for detecting internal defects or presence of
impurities in the cables after the cables have been
completed. Therefore, the testing of the completed cables
had to rely upon a partially destructive sampling
inspection in which one or more cables are sampled from a
lot of completed cables, and then, the sampled cables are
broken and tested.Furthermore, wire-like materials and rod-like materials
have been continuously produced in an industrial production
scale as elongated products, and then, have been used as
elongated products. As explained above, if even only a
portion of these elongated materials contains a small
defect, a total function of these elongated materials is
subjected to very serious influence. Accordingly, during a
production process, it is desirable to test the whole of
the elongated materials. However, there has not yet been a
non-destructive testing means that can precisely and
efficiently inspect the whole of the elongated materials so
as to find out an internal defect during a manufacturing
process of the elongated materials.An article by John Clark "Principles and Applications of
SQUIDs" published in Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 77, no.
8 of August 1989, New York, USA on pages 1208 to 1233
mentions that superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUIDs) are the most sensitive detectors of magnetic flux
available. On Page 1216 the author discloses that the most
important application of a gradiometer is in neuromagnetism
notably to detect weak magnetic signals emanating from the
human brain. The gradiometer discriminates
