<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In the case of known roller shutter doors having a flexible shutter and a bottom termination border which, in the closed position of the roller shutter door, butts in a sealed manner against a floor surface, there is the disadvantage that the susceptibility to damage due to impact with vehicles is high. 2.2 The roller shutter door according to the invention avoids this disadvantage in that the termination border (3) of the roller shutter door (1) exhibits a shield (7) which has such a reduced degree of bending strength and a high degree of elastic deformability that, in the event of impact loading, the shield (7) can be elastically deflected perpendicularly with respect to the plane of the roller shutter door. Macrolon is a particularly preferred material for the shield (7). 2.3 Roller shutter doors of this type are used preferably in the case of industrial buildings for terminating through-passageways and exterior door openings.
