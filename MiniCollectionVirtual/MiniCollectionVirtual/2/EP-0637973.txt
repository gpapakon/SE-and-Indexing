<ABSTRACT>
A trocar having a blade with a shaft (26) and a body (14). The body of the blade has a shoulder (36) creating a stepped relationship between the body and the shoulder of the blade. The thickness of the step is substantially the same thickness as the wall thickness (t) of the cannula (12) that fits over the blade. The inside diameter of substantially the entire length of the cannula is substantially the same as the outside diameter of the body of the blade. The distal end of the cannula has a number of slits (40) creating finger-like segments (42) that are formed of a material that is biased radially inwardly. The slits allow the fingers to collapse around the shoulder of the blade and the ends of the fingers have a shape substantially designed to conform to the outer shape of the body of the blade.

 DESCRIPTION"TROCAR WITH PROFILE TO REDUCE INSERTION FORCE" TECHNICAL FIELD Generally, my invention relates to a trocar which penetrates a body cavity for laprascopic procedures. More specifically, the present invention relates to a trocar with an improved profile which reduces the force necessary for insertion of the trocar into a body cavity. The improved trocar of this invention allows the user of the trocar to perform the insertion procedure with greater safety than through the use of devices known in the prior art.BACKGROUND ART Trocars are devices used in conjunction with minimal invasive surgery. The trocar is a combination of a blade and a cannula. The device is constructed so that once it penetrates the various body layers and enters a body cavity, the blade can be withdrawn leaving a cannula functioning as a channel for the insertion of surgical instruments into tho body cavity for use in performing the surgical procedure.In its specific application, this invention relates to and is used in connection with a laprascopic procedure such as laprascopic choleσystectomy. Such a procedure usually begins by the surgeon inserting a hollow needle into the abdominal cavity to introduce a gas under pressure to insufflate the cavity for creation of a work space for the procedure. A self sealing trocar, consisting of an outer cannula and an inner penetrating mandrel or blade extended beyond the distal end of the assembly, is then used to penetrate the abdominal wall. The outer cannula is forced, along with the blade, through the various layers forming the outer wall of the body and finally through the peritoneum and into the abdominal cavity. After the penetration process is completed, the blade is withdrawn, creating a channel along the length of the cannula through which various instruments are inserted for performing the laprascopic procedure.A problem that occurs occasionally during the trocar 

insertion procedure is the inadvertent puncturing of organs inside the cavity with the trocar blade. If an organ is inadvertently punctured during the procedure, what began as minimal invasive surgery may become a major operation and may require open cavity surgery to repair the punctured organ. It has been determined that one of the reasons that the procedure occasionally results in a punctured organ is because of the magnitude and inconsistency of the force required to penetrate the abdominal wall. Studies have shown rsee, e.g. , Corson, et al, Journal of Reproductive Medicine pp.282-84 (1989)] that the

CLAIMS
What I claim is:
1. A trocar including: a. A cannula having a proximal end and a distal end; b. a blade; c. means coaxially fitting the blade within the cannula; d. means controlling the extent to which the blade can be extended beyond the distal end of the cannula; and e. means creating a step-less connection between the blade and the cannula when the blade is extended beyond the distal end of the cannula.
2. A trocar as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means creating a step-less connection between the blade and the cannula include providing a shoulder on the blade.
3. A trocar as claimed in claim 2 wherein the cannula has fingers on the distal end thereof.
4. A trocar as claimed in claim 3 wherein the fingers retract about the blade to engage the shoulder thereof.
5. A trocar as claimed in claim 4 wherein the fingers are expandable to allow the blade to retract coaxially within the cannula.
6. A trocar as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means controlling the extent to which the blade can be extended beyond the distal end of the cannula include a base on the proximal end of the cannula and a grip connected to the blade.
7. A trocar as claimed in claim 6 including a shaft between the grip and the blade.
8. A trocar as claimed in claim 7 wherein the base of the cannula fits within the grip. 9. A trocar as claimed in claim 8 wherein the grip includes a channel with the base fitting within said channel. 


 10. A trocar as claimed in claim 6 wherein the base includes a flange.
11. A trocar as claimed in claim 10 wherein the flange interlocks with the grip. 12. A trocar including a. a cylindrically shaped cannula having a base at one end thereof and axially directed slots at the other end thereof; b. said axially directed slots forming fingers at the other end of said cannula; c. the other end of said cannula being formed of a material that is biased radially inwardly so that the fingers will tend to contract and cause the other end of the cannula to have a conical shape; d. the slots in the other end of the cannula are of a dimension that will allow the fingers to contract at the most a distance that will cause the outside diameter of the cannula at the tips of the fingers to be approximately 2t less than the outside diameter of the cannula at the base of the fingers where t is the thickness of the wall of the cannula; e. a blade coaxially fitted within the cannula; and f. said blade including a body and a shoulder, the body having an outside diameter substantially equal to but slightly less than the inside diameter of the cannula and the shoulder having an outside diameter 2t less than the inside diameter of the cannula.
13. The trocar as claimed in claim 12 including means controlling the extent that the blade can be extended beyond the other end of the cannula.
14. The trocar as claimed in claim 12 wherein the bias of the material causes the fingers to contract about the shoulder of the blade to create a stepless transition between the blade and the cannula when the blade is extended its maximum distance beyond the other end of the cannula. 


 15. A trocar as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means creating a step-less connection between the blade and the cannula include providing the blade with a body and a shoulder. 16. A trocar as claimed in claim 15 wherein the body is connected to the shoulder by an annular ramp.
17. A trocar as claimed in claim 16 wherein the angle of the annular ramp to the axis of the cannula in any plane that includes the axis of the cannula and passes through the annular ramp is in a range of between 5° to 60°.
18. The trocar as claimed in claim 17 wherein the fingers have ramp engaging surfaces that mate with the annular ramp.
19. The trocar as claimed in claim 18 wherein the ramp engaging surfaces are substantially the same shape as at least a portion of the annular ramp.
20. The trocar as claimed in claim 18 wherein the ramp engaging surfaces of the fingers are substantially the same shape as the portion of the annular ramp with which they mate.
