<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an Al-based cladding alloy (2) and the composite (1 + 2) obtained by placing this cladding on a core (1) of the 2000 series or 6000 series containing Cu. According to the invention, one of any particular alloy (2) contains, (by weight %) from 0.15 to 0.6 Si; from 0.3 to 0.8 Mg; less than 0.15 Mn; less than 0.4 Fe; less than 0.10 Cu; the balance Al and usual impurities. This composite (1 + 2) finds its key application in aircraft fuselages.
