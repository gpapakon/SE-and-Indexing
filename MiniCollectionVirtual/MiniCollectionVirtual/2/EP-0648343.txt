<ABSTRACT>
In a lithographically produced stepped lens with a Fresnel surface structure and a process for its production the high potential illumination speed of fast electron beam irradiation installations operating with a variable rectangular radiation cross section is to be converted into great efficacity for the production of Fresnel-type stepped lenses and thus reduce the quantity of data required. According to the invention, radiation dose distributions corresponding to cylindrical lenses, are applied in superimposed fashion so that at least one of the radiation dose distributions corresponds to one Fresnel cylindrical lens. The invention permits the effective lithographic production of novel lens structures with any lens curvature from radially spherical to elliptical.

Lithographically produced stepped lens with a 
Fresnel surface structure with radially symmetrical 

or elliptical optical effect by superimposition of 
radiation dose distributions from cylindrical lenses 

with cylinder axes offset to one another by an 
angle, characterised in that for the purpose of 

producing the surface structure at least one 
radiation dose distribution corresponds to a Fresnel 

cylindrical lens. 
Lithographically produced stepped lens as claimed in 
Claim 1, characterised in that the surface structure 

is produced by the superimposition of the radiation 
dose distributions from two Fresnel cylindrical lens 

with cylinder axes directed at right angles to one 
another and has steps in the form of adjacent step 

elements which are embedded in a grid system which 
is formed by their flanks directed at right angles 

to one another and which becomes smaller with 
increasing distance from the centre of the lens, 

whereby the flanks form together with the centre 
locations of the same heights at their points of 

intersection and at points of the perpendicular from 
the centre to the flanks, and that for each step 

element, starting from the locations of the same 
heights, height reductions are present which are of 

the same size in each direction perpendicular to the 
flanks and to the edge of the lens pointing from 

flank to flank and in the direction of the most 
distant points of intersection positioned towards 

the edge of the lens correspond to the sum of the 
height reductions occurring from flank to flank of  

 
a step element. 
Lithographically produced stepped lens as claimed in 
Claim 2, characterised in that the height reductions 

have a size in the directions perpendicular to the 
flanks with which a phase shift of whole number 

multiples of a wavelength is produced. 
Method of producing stepped lenses of Fresnel type 
in which structuring of a resist layer is effected 

by superimposing two radiation dose distributions 
from cylindrical lenses with cylinder axes offset by 

an angle and by a subsequent development process in 
which advance of a development front in the depth of 

the layer is stopped, characterised in that at least 
one of the superimposed radiation dose distributions 

corresponds to a Fresnel cylindrical lens. 
Method as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
one radiation dose distribution corresponds to a 

Fresnel lens profile and the other corresponds to a 
classical lens profile. 
Method as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
both radiation dose distributions correspond to a 

Fresnel lens profile. 
Method as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
both radiation dose distributions correspond to a 

classical lens profile.
