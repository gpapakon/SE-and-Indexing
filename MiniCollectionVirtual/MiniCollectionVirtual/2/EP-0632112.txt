<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a coated golf ball 
having beautiful appearance, wherein whiteness is enhanced 

by inhibiting enhancement of blueness. The golf ball body 
of the coated golf ball is coated with a white paint 

containing titanium oxide as a main pigment. The white 
paint comprises 45 to 60% by weight of titanium oxide, 

0.005 to 0.20% by weight of a blue pigment and 0.001 to 
0.06% by weight of a red pigment, based on 100% by weight 

of a solid content of a coating. The weight ratio of the 
blue pigment to the red pigment is 0.9 to 5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated golf ball in
which the golf ball body is coated with a paint. More
particularly, it relates to a coated golf ball wherein
whitening of the color tone of the golf ball is enhanced and
weathering properties are improved.Since a golf ball is used on green grass in sunlight, it
is necessary to enhance the whiteness in order to provide a
good appearance. The golf ball body is generally coated only
with a clear paint, or coated with an enamel paint containing
a white pigment and clear paint.In order to enhance the whiteness thereof, the amount of
titanium oxide as a white pigment can be increased. However,
the amount of titanium oxide which can be formulated in the
paint is limited.In order to improve the whiteness of golf balls, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 4-50029 suggests to formulate a
suitable amount of blue and violet pigments in a white paint
containing titanium oxide as a main pigment. However, the
blueness is also enhanced in addition to whiteness, which
results in a blackish color. We have now developed a coated golf ball having a good
appearance, wherein the whiteness is enhanced by inhibiting
the enhancement of the blueness of the paint.Accordingly, the present invention provides a coated golf
ball in which a golf ball body is coated with a white paint
containing titanium oxide as the main pigment thereof, the
white paint comprising 45 to 60% by weight of titanium oxide,
0.005 to 0.20% by weight of a blue pigment and 0.001 to 0.06%
by weight of a red pigment based on the solids content of the
paint and the weight ratio of the blue pigment to the red
pigment is 0.9 to 5.The white paint used in the present invention may be an
epoxy, acrylic or urethane paint. A urethane paint is
particularly preferred. For example, a white paint prepared
by reacting an active hydrogen-containing compound (e.g. a
polyester polyol, polyether polyol, etc.) as a main material
with an isocyanate compound as a curing agent is preferred.
As the isocyanate compound, a 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate
modified material (e.g. biulet material, trimethylolpropane
modification, trimer, etc.) is preferred. A tolylene
diisocyanate modified material is also preferred.The white paint contains titanium oxide as a white
pigment. The amount is suitably 45 to 60% by weight based on
the solids content of the coating. When the amount of white 
pigment is below 40% by weight, the coating hiding power
becomes inferior and, therefore, the preferred white color
cannot be obtained. When the amount
