<ABSTRACT>
The reflector (10) consists of a body (12) which is manufactured by injection moulding, is subsequently electrostatically provided with a coating (14) to which in turn a reflection layer (16) is applied. The moulding compound from which the body (12) is manufactured contains a thermoset plastic, preferably unsaturated polyester resin which is combined with low-profile additives, and an electrically conducting additive which is uniformly distributed in the moulding compound. Conducting carbon black having a weight content of between 1 and 10%, graphite having a weight content of between 1 and 25%, or metal powder or carbon fibres in each case having a weight content of between 1 and 30% can be used as electrically conducting additive. A mixture of the abovementioned additives can also be used. The body (12) which consists of the moulding compound can be directly electrostatically coated.
