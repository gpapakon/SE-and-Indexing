<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the ease of handling and the filtering properties of a multilayered, gas-permeable textile filtering material against toxic chemical substances, in particular filtering and protective materials for manufacturing sheet filters and protective clothing for civil and military applications, the filtering material has a first layer designed as a textile support layer linked to a second layer designed as a flat adhesive layer. In addition, the filtering has a third layer applied on the second layer and surface-linked thereto having a textile surface layer containing activated carbon fibers.
