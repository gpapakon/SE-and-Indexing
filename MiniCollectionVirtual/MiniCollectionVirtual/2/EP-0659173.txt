<ABSTRACT>
The method provides for continuous separation of residues from raw m-diaminotoluene mixtures (m-TDA; 2,4/2,6-diaminotoluene mixture) in the manufacture of residue-free 2,4/2,6-diaminotoluene mixtures (m-TDA). The use of the residue-free m-TDA mixtures is also disclosed. The residue-free m-toluylenediamine is prepared by nitration of toluene, hydrogenation of nitro compounds, separation of the water and solvent by distillation, and removal of the ortho-isomers from the toluylenediamine mixture by distillation. A sufficient quantity of 2,4- and 2,6-toluylenediamine (m-toluylenediamine, m-TDA) is distilled off from the residual product to leave tails having a 30 to 70 wt % residue concentration, an appropriate quantity of said tails being mixed with an adjuvant, inert to toluylenediamine and having a boiling point of over 290  C, to give a residue concentration of 28 to 50 wt %. The tails mixed with the adjuvant are subjected to a further single or multiple stage distillation until a 2,4- and 2,6-toluylenediamine residue concentration of 1 to 5 wt % is reached, and the remaining residual tails, still liquid at low temperatures, are sluiced out.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of residue-free m-tolylenediamine 
by nitrating toluene, hydrogenating 

the nitro compounds, separating the water and solvent 
by distillation and removing the ortho-isomers from 

the residue-containing tolylenediamine mixture by 
distillation, followed by distillation of the 

remainder, characterised in that the distillation is 
performed such that a quantity of 2,4- and 2,6-tolylenediamine 

(m-tolylenediamine, m-TDA) is 
distilled from the remainder such that a bottom having 

a residue concentration of from 30 to 70 wt-% remains, 
the latter bottom is mixed with an auxiliary substance 

which is inert to tolylenediamines and has a boiling 
point of 
>
 290°C in a quantity such as to adjust a 
residue concentration of from 28 to 50 wt-%, the 

latter bottom which is provided with the auxiliary 
substance undergoes a further single- or multi-stage 

distillation until a residual 2,4- and 2,6-tolylenediamine 
concentration of from 1 to 5 wt-% is 

obtained in the bottom, and the remaining residual 
bottom, which is still liquid even at low 

temperatures, is transferred out. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
one or more compounds from the following group are 

utilised as the auxiliary substance: 

distillation residues from ethylene glycol 
preparation (EDR) 
distillation residues from propylene glycol 
preparation (PDR) 
high-boiling polyethers based on ethylene oxide 
high-boiling polyethers based on propylene oxide  
 
high-boiling polyethers based on mixed polymers 
of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide 
high-boiling polyethers based on 
polytetrahydrofurans 
high-boiling polyethers based on mixed polymers 
of aromatic hydroxyl compounds 
high-boiling polyethers based on cycloaliphatic 
oxo compounds 
sugar, for example molasses 
high-boiling alkyl aromatics. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the distillation of the remainder takes place in 

single- or multi-stage manner. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the distillation is performed at temperatures of from 

160°C to 260°C, preferably at temperatures of from 
190°C to 220°C, and at pressures of from 2 to 100 mbar, 

preferably from 5 to 40 mbar.
