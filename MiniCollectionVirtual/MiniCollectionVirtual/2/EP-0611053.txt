<ABSTRACT>
A variable drive strength buffer circuit is 
provided that automatically adjusts its associated drive 

strength to compensate for variations in manufacturing 
parameters, environmental conditions and operating 

conditions. As a result, electromagnetic interference, 
power supply noise, edge rates and ringing may be 

reduced. The self-adjusting variable drive buffer 
circuit may be fabricated on an integrated circuit and 

includes a speed detector unit that measures the 
relative speed of the integrated circuit. In one 

embodiment, a self-adjusting variable drive strength 
buffer circuit includes a circuit speed detector unit 

having a delay chain consisting of a plurality of 
variable delay elements. When the delay chain length is 

matched to the period of an input clock, the length of 
the chain is an accurate measure of the relative "speed" 

of the transistors making up the delay chain and 
therefore of the other transistors on the integrated 

circuit chip. The length of the delay chain is encoded 
into a vector (one or more digital bits of information) 

that controls the amount of drive that is provided in 
the variable drive buffer circuit. More drive is 

provided if the transistors on the chip are relatively 
slow and less drive is provided if the transistors are 

relatively fast.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to buffer circuits employed
in integrated circuits and, more particularly, to the
automatic control of the drive strength of buffer
circuits. The invention also relates to methods for
controlling the drive strength of a buffer circuit.A digital circuit is fast or slow relative to the
time allotted by the overall system requirements. In
microprocessors, the time allotted to logic is usually
measured in periods or fractions of a period. If a
circuit is just fast enough to operate at 5MHz, for
example, then it is a "fast" circuit if used at an
operating frequency of 1MHz and a "slow" circuit if used
at an operating frequency above 5MHz.For a given operating frequency, a circuit is fast
or slow due to several factors. First, semiconductor
processing variations give rise to variations in the
speed of circuits. This, of course, is fixed for a
given device, but the speed of a randomly selected
device is not entirely predictable due to these
manufacturing variations. Second, the operating 
temperature of a device affects its speed. This is a
parameter that varies from application to application
and also within a given application over time. The
operating voltage of a device also affects its speed.
This parameter also varies from application to
application and over time within a given application.Buffer circuits are logic gates in integrated
circuits that have the primary function of driving
signals. Two important examples of buffer circuits are
circuits that drive clocks and circuits that drive
semiconductor device outputs. In both of these
instances, the buffer circuit provides the large drive
currents necessary to quickly drive signals with
relatively large loads.In practice, such buffer circuits must be designed
to drive the maximum expected load in the minimum
expected time such that the semiconductor device can
meet its specification under worst-case conditions and
over the expected range of variation in relevant
manufacturing parameters. However, during actual
operation, the manufacturing parameters, operating
conditions, operating frequencies and loads on these
signals are often not worst-case. In such cases, the
designed buffer drive strength is excessive. Excessive
drive strength can be problematic in several ways.Excessive drive strength on signals that carry
periodic waveforms results in excessive electromagnetic
interference (EMI). This in turn complicates the design
of systems by requiring the addition of shielding or by
requiring further optimizations to the design and
