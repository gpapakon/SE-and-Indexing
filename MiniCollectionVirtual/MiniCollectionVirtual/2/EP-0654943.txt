method and circuit adaptive to a scene which adaptively 

controls the brightness and contrast of a video input 
signal according to its average brightness level. The 

circuit comprises calculating means (20) for calculating 
the average brightness level during a predetermined period 

with respect to a video signal to be input through an 
input terminal; and controlling means (30) for controlling 

the brightness and contrast of the video input signal 
according to brightness correction characteristics 

corresponding to the calculated average brightness level, 
in which the range of the average brightness level in the 

video input signal is divided into a plurality of areas, 
and a plurality of input-output characteristic curves are 

provided so that the brightness and contrast of the video 
input signal is differently corrected for respective 

areas. The present invention has effects that naturally 
display even a dimly-lit picture by preventing an abrupt 

variation in brightness, and provide advanced pictures in 
brightness and contrast by adjusting only the contrast at 

a particular nAPL range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and circuit
for controlling the brightness and contrast of a video
signal, and more particularly relates to a method and
circuit in which the brightness and contrast of a video
signal is adaptively controlled according to the average
brightness level of a picture.Natural illumination can have an extremely wide
brightness range, and will have a vast range of contrast
scales. The human eye adapts itself remarkably well for
viewing naturally-lit objects and can easily perceive
detail in shadows. Nevertheless, cameras or televisions
are not easily adaptable to conditions of natural
illumination. Colour cameras can be responsive to input
light having a specific illumination range, but an
electric output signal of the camera is limited to a range
of, for example, 1 volt peak-to-peak. A conventional
display apparatus often displays a poor, undesirable
quality picture because its contrast range is extremely
narrow.To solve such a problem, US 4,152,720 and US
4,489,349 provide a "Contrast correction arrangement" and
a "Video brightness control circuit" respectively. These
Patents disclose methods for controlling contrast
according to brightness adjustment. In the contrast
correction apparatus of U.S. Patent No. 4,152,720,
relative contrast enhancement is achieved by adjusting
video signal input-output characteristics differently
according to a user's externally applied control values
for the camera. Figure 1 is a graph showing input-output
characteristics used in a conventional contrast correction
apparatus, which shows two characteristic curves y1 and y2 
expressed as y1(x)=pow(x,0.5) and y2(x)=pow(x,2), where
pow(x,2)=x2. The prior art relating to Figure 1 improves
the contrast based on the brightness control, and the
contrast enhancement is, in fact, partially accomplished
just as an additional effect of the brightness control.
Thus, there is a problem of a manual operation.The "Video brightness control circuit" of U.S. Patent
No. 4,489,349, controls the input-output characteristic
according to the average picture (brightness) level (APL) of a video
input signal, such as previously described for US
4,152,720. However, adaptive operation according to the
APL is different to that previously described whilst
achieving a similar effect. Figure 2 shows the input-output
characteristic of U.S. Patent No. 4,489,349, and
the input-output characteristic will be given as
OUT = [nAPL X y2(x)] + [(1-nAPL) X y1(x)]
   where, the nAPL is a normalized average brightness
level, i.e.,
