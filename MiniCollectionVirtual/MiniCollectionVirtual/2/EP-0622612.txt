<ABSTRACT>
A capacitive measuring device, particularly a length measuring device, exhibits a scale part (1) and a scanning unit (3) which is movable compared with the former and carries transmitting electrodes (5) and at least one receiving electrode (6). To improve the measuring accuracy, the transmitted signals are conducted via a synchronous modulator (7) to the transmitting electrodes (S0 to S7) and the received signal (E1, E2) is conducted via a demodulator (14). The same modulation frequency is used for modulation and demodulation. When the scanning unit (3) stands still compared with the scale part (1) the fundamental frequency of the received signal changes in accordance with the speed of movement compared with the fundamental frequency of the transmitted signal. This frequency change is evaluated by an evaluating circuit (18, 19, 20) for indicating the distance of movement.

Capacitive measuring apparatus, in particular a 
length measuring apparatus, comprising a scale portion (1) 

and a scanning unit (4) which is movable relative to said 
scale portion, said scanning unit having transmitting electrodes 

(5) and at least one receiving electrode (6); a transmitting 
circuit (7, 9, 10, 11) for applying transmitting signals 

(3) at a basic frequency to the transmitting electrodes, 
said at least one receiving electrode being connected to a 

receiving circuit (13, 14), an evaluating circuit (16, 18, 
19, 20) connected to the receiving circuit for the receiving 

signals; 

characterized in that 
the transmitting signals are applied to the transmitting 
electrodes (S0 to S7) via a pulse duration modulator and a 

synchronous modulator (7) and the receiving signal (E1, E2) 
is led via a demodulator (14); in that the synchronous modulator 

(7) and the demodulator (14) operate at the same modulation 
frequency which is higher than the basic frequency, 

and in that when the scanning unit (3) is stationary relative 
to the scale portion (1) the basic frequency of the receiving 

signal is equal to the basic frequency of the transmitting 
signal and when the scanning unit (3) moves relative to the 

scale portion (1) the basic frequency of the receiving signal 
changes corresponding to the speed of movement relative to 

the basic frequency of the transmitting signals and this 
change in frequency is evaluated by the evaluating circuit

modulator (7) at the basic frequency are pulse duration-modulated 

rectangular signals having an approximate sine 
function, in which a third harmonic is maintained low.

characterized in that 
a signal generator (9) for the generation of the pulse 
duration-modulated rectangular signals is controlled by an 

ROM-memory (10).

scale portion (1), is at the basic frequency of the transmitting 

signal, and when the scanning unit (3) moves relative 
to the scale portion (1) is at a frequency which differs from 

the basic frequency positively or negatively depending upon 
the respective direction of movement. 
Measuring apparatus according to claim 6, 

characterized in that 
a comparator (18) is connnected to the low-pass filter (16), 
said comparator forming a rectangular signal from the sinusoidal 

receiving signal which is synchronized with a counter

carried out with the comparator (18) affording a 10-bit 

resolution and the measurement results of the "n" measurements 
can be summed up.
