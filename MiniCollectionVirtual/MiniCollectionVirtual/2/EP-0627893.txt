<ABSTRACT>
A blood sampling system including a sampling device located in line is provided. The sampling device (26, 70, and 102) provides an access port (40, 76, and 120) that allows undiluted blood to be sampled automatically by insertion of a luer. The sampling device can have a number of different structures, for example, a swing valve (41), a ball valve (88), or a breakable seal (130) for normally closing the sample port until a nozzle (60) of the luer blood collector is forcibly inserted into the sample port.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sampling device for use in a blood collection system.Of course, it is known to collect and use blood for
a variety of treatments and therapies, e.g.,
transfusions. To effectively use collected blood it is
necessary to test the blood to determine its type and
other characteristics.It is advantageous to sample blood directly from a
donor rather than sample blood that is collected in a
collection bag. An anticoagulant, or other solutions,
are typically added to the blood in the collection bag.
By sampling directly from the donor, undiluted blood,
e.g., blood with no anticoagulant or other constituent,
from the donor can be sampled.A variety of techniques are used for this type of
blood sampling. Such techniques are illustrated in
Figures 1-4.In one technique illustrated in Figure 1, a tube 10
leading from a donor needle 11 to the primary collection
bag (not illustrated) is clamped. Scissors are used to
cut the tube on the collection bag side. The open end
12 of the tube 10 is then directed into a test tube 13
while releasing pressure on the clamp 14 to pour blood
into the open test tube.Another technique, illustrated in Figure 2, utilizes
an in-line intermediate needle 16 that is exposed by
removing an in-line cover section 15 of the tube. An 
evacuated donor sampling tube 17 with a rubber stopper is connected to the
needle 16. The needle 16 pierces the rubber stopper and blood flows into
the sample tube 17.Figure 3 illustrates another method of sampling blood. After the
needle 18 is withdrawn from the donor's arm, the donor needle is used to
pierce a rubber stopper of an evacuated test tube 19. A disadvantage of this
system is that it does not sample blood from the donor but rather, samples
blood, including an anticoagulant from the primary collection bag 21.Figure 4 illustrates a still further method that involves using a Y-shaped
branch connector 23 on the donor line 25 between the donor needle
27 and the primary collection bag (not shown). The outlet 33 of the Y
connector include a connection system allowing filling of an evacuated test
tube 35 through an adaptor 37.EP-A-0462814, which is the basis for the preamble of claim 1, discloses a blood sampling device in a blood
collection system, which device uses a blunt ended cannula inserted in a
pre-slit septum for sampling.There are a number of disadvantages with the prior art systems. For
example, the use of scissors to cut the tubes creates the possibility for
contamination of the system. Further, the prior art

<CLAIMS>
A sampling device for use in a collection system for collecting
blood from a donor, the sampling device including a body comprising:


an inlet (124) for receiving blood flow from a donor and a first
outlet (122) for allowing blood flow to a first collection point (22); and
a port (120) having a second outlet normally closed but openable
for allowing blood flow to a second collection point,

   
characterised by
 a frangible membrane (130) closing the port, the
membrane being rupturable by insertion of a sampling nozzle

(108) into the port to open the port, whereby blood can pass
through the nozzle to said second collection point.
The sampling device of Claim 1 wherein the second outlet (120)
includes a seal cover (48) that is applied thereover.
The device of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said body is a molded plastics
body.
The device of Claim 3, wherein said body is a one-piece plastics
body.
The device of any preceding claim including a blood collection
channel extending between the inlet and the first outlet, the channel having

first and second portions defined by an angle in the channel between the
inlet and first outlet, such that the first portion is angled away from the

second portion.
The device of Claim 5, including a blood sampling channel
extending from said port (120) and opening into the blood collection 

channel, the first portion of the blood collection channel extending
between the inlet and said angle and being axially aligned with the

sampling channel.
The device of Claim 5 or 6, wherein said angle is an oblique angle.
The sampling device of any preceding claim in combination with
a sampling nozzle (108) that is insertable into the port (120) to

open the port for sampling blood from said second collection point.
The combination of Claim 8, wherein the nozzle blocks the flow of
blood from the inlet (124) to the first outlet (122) when the nozzle has

been inserted into the port for sampling blood from said second collection
point.
The combination of Claim 8 or 9 wherein the port (120) is resilient
to grippingly hold the nozzle (108) therein when sampling blood from the

second collection point.
