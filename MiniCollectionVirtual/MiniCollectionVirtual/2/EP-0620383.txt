<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a centrifugal planetary friction transmission, 
particularly to a centrifugal planetary friction transmission having an input 
shaft, an output shaft, at least a rotating arm, at least one irrotational 
internal friction pulley, at least one set of linked planetary external friction 
pulleys rotating about its axis and orbiting about an axis of the internal 
friction pulleys, said at least one set of external friction pulleys having 
radially floating means so as to float radially and to engage with said internal 
friction pulleys under the action of centrifugal force. US4733579 has disclosed a variable speed drive comprising an input shaft and 
an output shaft which have a common central axis. The input shaft is 
provided with an eccentric extension rotatably supporting a rigid combination 
of internal ring-gears, which combination is allowed to rotate about the off 
-set axis while it rotates about the common axis. The first external gear 
nonrotatably mounted on the output shaft is disposed within and engages the 
first internal gear, and other external gears are disposed within and engages 
other corresponding internal gears. The extensions of the other external gears 
is engageble with brake means. Though the different combination of the 
engagement of the brake means, the output shaft may be rotated forward, 
reversely, or at variable speed. However, the adjacent pairs of frictional 
pulleys are respectively provided with frictional surfaces tapared in opposite 
direction, and between adjacent pairs of friction pulleys there is provided a 
spring so as to make the friction pulley have normal pressure for producing  
 
the friction force. Since the frictional coefficient is small, the spring force is 
normally greater than the frictional force by an order of magnitude, thus the 
load of the bearing for transmitting the spring forces is too great, the efficient 
is low, the transmission is heated and life is short. The relative slide friction 
between the frictional pulleys may aggravate such problems. Moreover, due to the restriction of spring force, and the friction force is 
small than the spring force by an order of magnitude, the friction torque is 
small and the output torque moment of the transmission is unsufficient. The object of the invention is to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art and 
provide a mechanical variable speed drive having high efficiency, which can 
be shifted without cutting out the load. In order to realize the object mentioned above, the
