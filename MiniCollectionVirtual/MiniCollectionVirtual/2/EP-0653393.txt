<ABSTRACT>
The corrosion of ferrous-based metals imbedded in concrete 
containing a chloride is inhibited by drawing the chlorides away 

from the metal, and then applying a composition containing ammonium 
carbamate or ammonium carbonate to the concrete. An agent may be 

added to the solution to prevent any calcium hydroxide contained 
in the concrete from precipitating the corrosion inhibitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlling corrosion and, more 
particularly, to a method for inhibiting the corrosion of ferrous-based 
materials imbedded in concrete containing a chloride. In the United States, billions of dollars have been spent in 
the construction of highways, freeways and their associated 
overpasses and bridges. One of the most important problems the 
nation has faced is how to maintain the integrity of this system 
of roads and associated structures at an acceptable cost. A problem which reduces the integrity of roadways and related 
structures and buildings located near sources of saltwater, is the 
corrosion of the contained reinforcing material by chloride-based 
deicers, seawater and other sources of chlorides. These substances 
continuously attack the reinforcing materials within concrete, 
causing the roadways and structures to degrade and ultimately fail 
prematurely. At a potential cost of billions of dollars, the 
nation is confronted with the task of repairing its highway system 
and other structures by removing the corroding reinforcing steel 
and replacing it with new reinforcing material. Yet, if the 
corroded steel is not replaced and corrosion is allowed to continue 
to critical stages, the road surfaces and structures may 
potentially fail catastrophically with associated human losses. In an effort to avoid such failures and possibly to find a 
less expensive solution than replacing the reinforcing materials, 
much research has been conducted to learn how to stop the corrosion 
of steel imbedded in concrete. The published literature appears to indicate that concrete, 
alone, inhibits the corrosion of imbedded reinforcing steel. The 
corrosion may in some instances be chemical, but it is more 
commonly electrochemical in nature. The area of the steel where 
metal ions go into solution in an amount chemically equivalent to 
the reaction at cathodic regions is the anodic region. If the  
 
metal is iron, it goes into solution and forms ferrous ions, Fe⁺⁺, 
plus two electrons, 2e⁻, to maintain an equilibrium of electrical 
charges. An equivalent quantity of hydrogen is plated out as a 
thin film at the adjacent surface regions of the metal known as the 
cathode. This thin film of hydrogen inhibits further corrosion of 
the iron surface. The anodic and cathodic reactions are summarized 
as follows: At anode: 
Fe → Fe⁺⁺ + 2e⁻   (1)At cathode: 
2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → H₂   (2)The reaction at the cathode regions is relatively slow in 
alkaline media because the concentration of hydrogen
