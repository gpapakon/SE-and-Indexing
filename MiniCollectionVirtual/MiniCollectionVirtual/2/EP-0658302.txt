<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for protecting tree trunks, comprising a tubular element formed of a material with a net-like structure and able to be located around the trunk to be protected, at some distance, the said tubular element consisting of a set of crossed strands of plastic joined at their intersections and defining meshes of square or diamond-shaped section. It comprises a second set of crossed strands (3, 4) made of plastic, of smaller cross-section than the strands of the first set (1, 2), linked at their intersections so as to form a net-like structure, the meshes of which each have an opening cross-section markedly smaller than the opening cross-section of the meshes defined by the first set of strands (1, 2).

<CLAIMS>
Device for protecting saplings, comprising a
tubular element formed from a material having a reticulate

structure and capable of being arranged, at some
distance, around the sapling to be protected, the said

tubular element consisting of a set of crossed plastic
strands joined together at their intersections and

defining mesh cells of square or diamond-shaped cross-section,
characterized in that it comprises a second set

of crossed plastic strands (3, 4), of smaller cross-section
than that of the strands of the first set (1, 2),

joined together at their intersections so as to form a
reticulate structure, each of the mesh cells of which has

an opening cross-section appreciably less than the
opening cross-section of the mesh cells defined by the

first set of strands (1, 2).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the ratio of the cross-section of the strands (1, 2)

of the first set to the cross-section of the strands (3,
4) of the second set is between 10 and 50.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the ratio of the opening cross-sections

of the mesh cells defined by the first set of
strands (1, 2) to the opening cross-sections of the mesh

cells defined by the second set of strands (3, 4) is
between 10 and 100.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is produced as one piece

by extrusion.
