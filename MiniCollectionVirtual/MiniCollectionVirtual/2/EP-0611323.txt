<ABSTRACT>
An analytical rotor (10) for separating plasma from whole blood is made up of layers (12, 14) and (16) and has a blood application port (22) in layer (12) thereof. Blood introduced to the application port (22) is metered into a metering chamber (40) by capillary flow while the rotor (10) remains stationary. Excess blood passes into an overflow chamber (44) by capillary flow, either simultaneously with the flow to metering chamber (40) or later, after opening of vent passage connecting to overflow chamber (44). Subsequent rotation of the rotor (10) causes metered blood in the metering chamber (40) to flow into a separating chamber (60), typically retaining the separate plasma. A method of transferring a metered volume of fluid in rotor (10) is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SAMPLE METERING PORT FOR ANALYTICAL ROTORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the nventionThe present invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for separating cellular material from biological fluids and, more particularly, to the design and use of a centrifugal rotor which is capable of separating plasma from a measured volume of whole blood and optionally distributing the plasma to a plurality of test wells within the rotor.Blood tests frequently require that potentially-interfering cellular components of the blood be separated from the blood plasma prior to testing of the plasma. It is also frequently desirable to divide the separated blood plasma into a plurality of discrete aliquots so that a variety of tests or assays may be performed on the blood. Such separation and division steps have heretofore been typically performed by centrifugation to separate the blood plasma from the cellular components, followed by manual or automated pipetting of the blood plasma into separate test wells. Such procedures are labor intensive and time-consuming, and various automated systems and methods have been proposed for providing multiple aliquots of plasma suitable for testing in a more efficient manner.Of particular interest to the present invention are centrifugal rotors which have been modified both to separate plasma from whole blood and to distribute the separated plasma into separate test wells. The use of such rotors can provide a plurality of discrete plasma volumes which may be tested or evaluated, all present 

 within the centrifugal rotor, greatly enhancing the efficiency of automated testing procedures.Although a significant improvement over prior manual or partly manual procedures, previous modified centrifugal rotors have suffered from a number of deficiencies. Such rotors have frequently required the application of relatively large volumes of whole blood in order to achieve the desired separation and distribution. Moreover, such rotors have frequently utilized complex designs which are difficult and costly to manufacture. Often, the rotors require various separable parts or components which are brought together or separated at different points in the centrifugation procedure. Previous centrifugal rotors have often required the user to manually measure a volume of sample prior to applying the sample to the rotor. The need to manually measure the sample volume can significantly decrease the efficiency of an otherwise automated process.For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An analytical rotor comprising: a rotor body having top and bottom surfaces, a central axis, and a sample application port through the top surface; a metering chamber disposed in the rotor body and connected to the sample application port to receive fluid therefrom; an overflow chamber disposed in the rotor body and connected to the sample application port to receive fluid therefrom; and means for selectively directing flow from the sample application port to the metering chamber in preference to the overflow chamber, whereby the metering chamber will fill entirely with fluid and excess fluid will flow to the overflow chamber while the rotor remains stationary.
2. An analytical rotor as in claim 1, wherein the metering chamber and the overflow chamber have capillary dimensions to effect capillary flow of fluid for the sample application port.
3. An analytical rotor as in claim 2, wherein the metering chamber has a flow area larger than the flow area of the overflow chamber, such that the fluid flow rate into the metering chamber is higher than the flow rate into the overflow chamber.
4. An analytical rotor as in claim 2, wherein the means for selectively directing flow comprises a first vent in the metering chamber, a second vent in the overflow chamber, and means for selectively blocking the second vent, whereby fluid flows only into the metering chamber until the second vent is unblocked. 


 5. An analytical rotor as in claim 1, wherein the means for selectively directing flow comprises a capillary inlet segment connecting the measuring chamber to the sample application port and a capillary connecting passage connecting the overflow chamber to the sample application port, wherein the capillary inlet segment has a flow area larger than the flow area of the connecting passage, such that the fluid flow rate into the metering chamber is higher than, the flow rate into the overflow chamber.
6. An analytical rotor as in claim 6, wherein the means for selectively blocking comprises a membrane covering the second vent.
7. An analytical rotor comprising: a rotor body having top and bottom surfaces, a central axis, and a sample application port through the top surface; a metering chamber having capillary dimensions and being connected to the sample application port; a receiving chamber disposed radially outward from the metering chamber and being connected to the metering chamber through a passage which does not have capillary dimensions; an overflow chamber having capillary dimensions and connected to the sample application port; and means for selectively directing flow from the sample application port to the metering chamber in preference to the overflow chamber, whereby the metering chamber will fill entirely with fluid and excess fluid will flow to the overflow chamber while the rotor remains stationary.
8. An analytical rotor as in claim 7, wherein the metering chamber has a flow area larger than the flow area of the overflow chamber, such that the fluid flow 


rate into the metering chamber is higher than the flow rate into the overflow chamber.
9.
