<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to isocyanate/epoxy compositions for heavy-duty
applications, which compositions are polymerizable under microwave radiation.In particular, the present invention relates to particular organic compositions
comprising at least a compound carrying more than one isocyanate group (-NCO), and
at least a compound carrying at least one epoxy group, which compositions are
polymerizable to a crosslinked material having an excellent combination of chemical,
physical arid technological properties. The present invention relates further to a process
for polymerizing said compositions by applying an electromagnetic radiation in the
microwave range of frequencies.Several industrial sectors call for high-performance crosslinkable resins (also
called thermosetting resins) for fabrication of high-quality and long-endurance
polymeric articles for heavy-duty applications. Such thermosetting resins must have a
high fluidity before polymerization, as well as an excellent combination of chemical,
physical arid mechanical properties after being polymerized in the so-called curing and,
eventually, post-curing cycles.Particularly desirable are those resins which are rapidly polymerizable under
appropriate conditions, but have also to remain liquid at room or, preferably, rather
high temperatures long enough to meet the critical requirements of important
discontinuous and continuous technologies where the thermosetting resin is necessarily
fed as mono-component mixture, batchwise prepared and stored even several hours
before use. Such a time interval, during which a thermosetting resin remains liquid and 
handable, is generally known as pot-life.Examples of said technologies are:
a) resin casting, for fabrication of a variety of articles such as electrical insulators,
connectors and relays, as well as to make insulating or protective coatings of
electrical motors or other electrical machinery;b) embedding and encapsulation, by vacuum, pressure or combined
vacuum/pressure casting, of electrical/electronic devices, such as transformers,
capacitors, etc.;c) resin pultrusion and pulforming with reinforcing fibers, for manufacturing of
structural beams, bars, etc., for industrial and civil constructions and
transportation, particularly where elevated peak and/or service temperatures are
involved.These technologies require resins with appropriately low viscosities. Generally,
a resin having a low viscosity is particularly suitable for use in most of preparation,
handling and processing stages thereof, such
