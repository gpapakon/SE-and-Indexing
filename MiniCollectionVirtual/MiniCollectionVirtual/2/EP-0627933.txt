<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a method for treating autoimmune diseases in mammals, the method comprising administering to the mammals an effective amount for treating the diseases of a bystander antigen, the antigen eliciting the release of transforming growth factor beta (TGF- beta ) at a locus within the body of the mammals wherein T-cells contributing to autoimmune response are found to suppress the T-cells contributing to the disease. The invention is directed also to compositions comprising bystander antigens useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in mammals and to pharmaceutical formulations thereof.

The United States government has rights to this
invention by virtue of funding from Grant No. 529352 from the
National Institutes of Health. Part of the research that
culminated in the present invention was supported by a Public
Health Service Fogarty Int'l Research Fellowship No. 1fo5two4418

Weiner et al., U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos.
460,852 filed February 21, 1990, and 596,936, filed October 15,
1990 (the former being the national stage of PCT Application No.
PCT/US88/02139, filed June 24, 1988), which in turn are
continuation-in-part applications of U.S. Patent Application

Application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 379,778, filed

607,826 filed October 31, 1990; andWeiner et al., U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
595,468, filed October 10, 1990.This invention pertains to an improvement in the
treatment of autoimmune diseases. More specifically, the
invention is directed to the use of bystander antigens (i.e.
antigens that suppress cells involved in the autoimmune process)
for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The invention also
includes pharmaceutical formulations comprising bystander
antigens useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in
mammals.Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an abnormal
immune response directed against normal autologous (self)
tissues.Based on the type of supranormal immune response
involved, autoimmune diseases in mammals can generally be
classified in one of two different categories: cell-mediated
(i.e., T-cell-mediated) or antibody-mediated disorders. Non-limiting
examples of cell-mediated autoimmune diseases include
multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune
thyroiditis (AT), diabetes mellitus (juvenile onset or Type 1
diabetes) and autoimmune uveoretinitis (AUR). Antibody-mediated
autoimmune diseases include myasthenia gravis (MG) and systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE).Both categories of autoimmune diseases are currently
being treated with drugs which suppress immune responses in a
non-specific manner, i.e., drugs which are incapable of suppressing
selectively the abnormal immune response. Non-limiting

<CLAIMS>
Use of a bystander antigen for preparing an oral or inhalable medicament for
treating or preventing an autoimmune disease in an individual, wherein said

bystander antigen is specific to an organ or tissue afflicted by immune attack
during said disease and wherein said bystander antigen is not the primary

target of attack by the immunoregulatory system during said disease and does
not induce in mammals a condition having the characteristics of said disease.
Use according to claim 1 wherein said medicament is orally administered to
said individual.
Use according to claim 1 wherein said medicament is administered to said
individual via inhalation.
Use according to claim 1 which further comprises a synergist effective in
combination with said bystander antigen to treat said disease.
Use according to claim 1 which further comprises administering to said
individual in a separate step an amount of a synergist effective in combination

with said bystander antigen to treat said disease.
Use according to claim 1 wherein said bystander antigen is a peptide
comprising an immunosuppressive epitope. 
Use of glucagon for preparing an oral or inhalable medicament for treating
type I diabetes in a mammal.
Use according to claim 7 wherein said medicament is orally administered.
Use according to claim 7 wherein said medicament is administered via
inhalation.
Use of GAD for preparing an oral or inhalable medicament for treating type I
diabetes in a mammal.
Use according to claim 10 wherein said medicament is orally administered.
Use according to claim 10 wherein said medicament is administered via
inhalation.
