<ABSTRACT>
Installation for continuous purification of a solvent (6) of high boiling point, higher than 150 DEG C, at atmospheric pressure, including a distillation unit (4) fed in its lower part with the solvent (6) to be purified, originating from a user equipment (1), a vacuum pump (5) capable of conveying the distillate resulting from the distillation, which has it suction orifice connected to the said distillation unit (1) in a region (9) for collecting the distillate and its delivery orifice connected to a conduit (2) for return towards the said user equipment, characterised in that the said vacuum pump (5) is a vane pump, comprising a functional assembly including a rotor (11) and a stator (12), the said assembly being situated in a tank (13) filled with a lubricating liquid, the said liquid consisting of the said pure solvent (6A).

Installation for continuous purification of a solvent 
(6) with a high boiling point, in excess of 150Â°C at 

atmospheric pressure, comprising a distillation unit (4) fed 
in its lower part with the solvent (6) to be purified from a 

user equipment (1) and a vacuum pump (5) adapted to convey the 
distillate having its inlet connected to said distillation 

unit (1) in a distillate recovery area (9) and its outlet 
orifice (15) connected to a return pipe (2) to said user 

equipment, characterised in that said vacuum pump (5) is a 
vane pump including a functional unit comprising a rotor (11) 

and a stator (12), said functional unit being disposed in a 
tank (13) filled with a lubricating liquid, said liquid being 

in the form of the pure solvent (6A).
