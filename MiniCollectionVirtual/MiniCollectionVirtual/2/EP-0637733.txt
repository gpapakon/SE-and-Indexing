<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for measuring the temperature prevailing in a region to be monitored. This device comprises a measurement chain (11, Ri) supplied under a supply voltage Vo and means for processing a measurement signal, comprising an analogue/digital convertor (12). The device according to the invention is characterised in that it furthermore comprises a plurality of resistors (R1...Ri-1) in series, placed in the measurement chain, and a selection means (13) designed to select a reference voltage from a plurality of voltages tapped from a point in the plurality of resistors and to deliver this selected reference voltage to the convertor. Such a device makes it possible to measure a temperature over an extended range, by changing reference voltages without disturbing the conversion curves of the convertor.

Device for measuring the temperature prevailing in a zone to be
monitored, said device being of the type comprising:


a measurement system supplied with a supply voltage Vo and
comprising:


a temperature sensor (11) with variable resistance (R
T
)
adapted to generate an analogue signal representative of the

temperature measured in the zone to be monitored,
and a resistor (R
i
) connected in series with the sensor, on
the one hand, and connected to the positive terminal of the

supply voltage Vo on the other hand, said resistor
cooperating with the sensor so as to generate an analogue

measurement signal,
and a measurement signal processing means comprising an
analogue/digital converter (12) adapted to receive, in particular,

the analogue measurement signal and a reference voltage Vref in
order to generate, in response, a digital value N representative of

the measured temperature,

said device being characterised in that it also comprises:
a plurality of resistors (R

) connected in series with the
resistor R
i
,
and a selection means (13) adapted to select a reference voltage
taken at a point in the plurality of resistors (R
1
,...R
i
) and to deliver 
this selected reference voltage to the analogue/digital converter

(12).
Measuring device according to claim 1, characterised in that it also
comprises at least one branch circuit connected in parallel to the terminals of

the resistor(s) (R
1
,...R
i
) supplying the reference voltage to the converter (12).
Measuring device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that each
branch circuit comprises a transistor.
