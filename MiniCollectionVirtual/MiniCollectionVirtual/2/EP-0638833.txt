<ABSTRACT>
A display arrangement comprises an image intensifier tube 1 or some other device 
which provides a representation of a viewed scene at 3. A supertwist LCD 4 and associated 

polarisers 5 and 6 are located between the output 3 and a viewer 7. A ferroelectric liquid 
crystal shutter 11 is located between the LCD 4 and second polariser 6. The LCD 4 is 

controlled to produce symbology. By switching the shutter 11 the polarisation of the 
incident radiation is switched between two states differing by 90Â°. This causes the LCD 4 to 

operate in two states. In one state the viewed scene is transmitted through the LCD 4 and in 
the other state it is absorbed and any symbology on the LCD 4 is contrasted with a dark 

absorbing background. The shutter 11 is switched sufficiently quickly that the observer 7 
perceives the symbology overlaid on the viewed scene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to display arrangements and more particularly, but not 
exclusively, to arrangements including liquid crystal devices for presenting symbology or 
other imagery overlaid on a viewed scene. In many applications, it is desirable to be able to provide a viewer of a scene with 
additional visual information. For example, an aircraft pilot may be equipped with goggles 
which permit direct viewing of a scene whilst superimposing data, for example concerning 
airspeed, altitude and so on, from a display using a suitable arrangement of prisms and other 
optical components to conduct it to the focal plane. In other arrangements, the scene may be 
viewed via an image intensifier, for example, which may convert infrared radiation into the 
visible part of the spectrum and intensify low level visible radiation. It may also be 
advantageous to provide additional symbology overlaid on an intensified image of the scene. The present invention is applicable to both applications in which a scene is viewed 
directly by an observer, with or without enhancements provided by an optical assembly, and 
for those in which the viewed scene is representative of the actual scene and has been 
subjected to processing by an image intensifier tube or some other device. According to the invention there is provided a display arrangement comprising a 
display assembly including a first liquid crystal display and a second display located behind 
the first and means for changing the polarisation of light transmitted through said means  
 
whereby the assembly display mode is changed. The first display is nearest the viewer and the second display is located to the rear, 
behind it. The means for changing the polarisation of light in an arrangement in accordance 
with the invention may be capable of operating at relatively high switching speeds, enabling 
switching-between display modes to be achieved at a higher rate than would be possible if 
the displays themselves were modified to change the mode of the assembly. The invention is 
particularly applicable to arrangements in which the second display is a viewed scene 
presented at an input of the arrangement. The first display may be arranged to display 
symbolic information. By switching the polarisation between two states the symbology may 
appear overlaid on the viewed scene. In other arrangements, the second display could be a 
liquid crystal display, for example. In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the arrangement is such that, by 
switching the

A display arrangement comprising a display assembly including a first liquid crystal 
display (4, 13, 28) and a second display (3, 14, 30) located behind the first, and means (11, 

12, 20, 26) for changing the polarisation of light transmitted through the said means 
whereby the assembly display mode is changed. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein the second display (3, 14) is a viewed 
scene presented at an input of the arrangement. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2 and including means (3, 14) for presenting a 
viewed scene at an input of the display assembly such that the first display (4, 13) appears 

overlaid on the scene to a viewer. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 3 wherein said means for presenting a viewed scene 
includes an image intensifier tube (11). 
An arrangement as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said means (11, 12, 20) for 
changing the polarisation is switchable between two states such that the display assembly 

switches between a first display mode in which the background of the first display (4, 13) is 
substantially optically transmissive and a second display mode in which it is substantially 

optically absorbing. 
A display arrangement comprising: a display device including a liquid crystal display (4, 
 

13) located between two polarisers (5, 6, 24, 21); means (11, 20) located between the display 
(4, 13) and one of the polarisers (6, 21) for controlling the polarisation of light transmitted 

through the said means (11, 20) such that, by switching said means between two states, the 
device switches between a first mode in which the display background is substantially 

optically transmissive and a second mode in which it is substantially optically absorbing; and 
means (3, 14) for presenting a viewed scene at an input of the display device such that the 

display image appears overlaid on the scene to a viewer.

includes lens means (15, 25) having focal characteristics which are dependent on the 

polarisation of incident light and located on the viewing side of the means (20, 26) for 
changing the polarisation.
