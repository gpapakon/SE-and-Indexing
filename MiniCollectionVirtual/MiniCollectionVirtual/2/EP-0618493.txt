<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide color
photographic photo-sensitive material. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a silver halide color
photographic photo-sensitive material which is highly
sensitive to light, is excellent in storability and is
improved in pressure induced desensitization.Color photography is a process of producing dye
images achieved by using a photo-sensitive material
comprising a support having thereon photographic structural
layers comprising a silver halide emulsion and dye forming
couplers. The photo-sensitive material is subjected to
color development processing with an aromatic primary amine
color developing agent, resulting in production of an
oxidation product of the developing agent. The dye images
are formed by reaction of this oxidation product with the
dye forming couplers.Simplified and rapid color development processing is
a strong requirement of the color photographic field and
various improvements have been achieved. Advanced faster
systems have been developed one after another in a cycle of
a few years. To increase a processing speed requires a further
approach to shortening time for each of color development,
bleach-fixing, washing with water and drying processes. A
method of increasing the processing speed is disclosed in,
for example, International Patent Publication No. WO
87/04534. This publication discloses a method of rapid
processing by using, as a photographic emulsion, a color
photographic photo-sensitive material comprising silver
halide with higher contents of silver chloride. From the
viewpoint of the rapid processing, it would be preferable to
use the emulsion with the higher contents of the silver
chloride.Such efforts yield a technique of printing images of
a color negative on a silver halide color photographic
printing paper for silver halide based printing, which has
become a common method for simple and easy production of
high-quality images.The higher contents of the silver chloride in the
silver halide emulsion to be used result in a far advance in
a development speed. The silver chloride emulsion is,
however, found to have a disadvantage of lower photo-sensitivity.
With this respect, various techniques and
methods are disclosed to improve the photo-sensitivity of
such silver halide emulsion having a high silver chloride
content (hereinafter, referred to as "high silver chloride 
emulsion"), and thereby to overcome the above mentioned
problem.European Patent Publication No. 0,534,395A1
discloses that a higher sensitivity
