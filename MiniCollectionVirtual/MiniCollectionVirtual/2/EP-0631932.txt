<ABSTRACT>
For the automatic assembly of containers which comprise 
two generally cup-like bodies (2, 3) which fit together 

by engagement of their open ends, a structure (11) is 
provided which defines a duct in which the bodies (2, 3) 

are made to advance against each other by pusher means 
(15, 16). The duct has at least one radially-contractible 

portion (18) whereby, during the end-to-end 
engagement of the two cup-like bodies (2, 3), elements 

(S, F) contained in at least one body and liable to 
project radially from the open ends which are coupled 

radially, are contained, thereby avoiding any 
interference with the end-to-end engagement movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for the 
assembly of containers and was developed with particular 
attention to its possible use, for example, in the 
automatic assembly of containers for small toys, trinkets 
and the like intended to be inserted as "surprises" in 
food products or the like. In this field of application, an arrangement has been 
known for many years whereby a surprise is put inside a 
container (commonly known as a "little barrel") made up 
of two cup-like bodies which can be fitted together by 
end-to-end engagement of their open ends. Very often, the surprise is of a type requiring assembly 
and a sheet of assembly instructions and/or a sheet of 
transfers to be applied to the surprise must be put into 
the container as well as the component parts: usually, 
this sheet or sheets are rolled into a tube for insertion 
in one of the two cup-like bodies, in contact with its 
inner surface. In view of the high production rate of the products in 
which the container must be inserted (especially in the 
case of confectionery manufactured on an industrial  
 
scale) and considering the need to keep the cost of the 
surprise as low as possible, it is definitely desirable 
to be able to fill and assemble the container 
automatically, especially as far as the following 
operations are concerned: 
picking up the component parts of the surprise in 
order to put them into the container, inserting the parts into the container (usually into 
one of its cup-like constituents), together with the 
sheet or sheets carrying the assembly instructions and/or 
decorative transfers, and assembling the container by coupling its two 
constituent cup-like bodies. Until now, it has been practically impossible to carry 
out the operations described above entirely 
automatically. In order to ensure that the finished 
product was reliable (especially to ensure that the 
container contains all parts of the surprise, that the 
sheet or sheets are inserted and that the container is 
securely closed), manufacturers were therefore obliged to 
resort to manual packaging which involved considerable 
problems of organization, cost and, above all, hygiene of 
the finished product. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
solution to the last of the problems described above 
(that is the automatic assembly of the container), the  
 
other problems being solved by arrangements which are the 
subject of other European patent applications, filed on 
the same date by the same applicant. According to the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the assembly of containers 
comprising two generally cup-like bodies (2, 3) which fit 

together by engagement of their open ends, of which at 
least one body (3), at the time of assembly, contains 

elements (S, F) liable to project radially from its open 
end (4), including: 


a structure defining a duct (11) in which the bodies 
(2, 3) can advance (15, 16) towards each other and pusher means for 

advancing the bodies into 
end-to-end engagement; the duct (11) comprising at least 

one portion (18) able to contract radially so that, at 
rest, its cross-section is at least marginally smaller 

than the outline of the open ends of the bodies (2, 3); 
and wherein the 
 
   pusher means (15, 16) advance the bodies (2, 3) 

into end-to-end engagement in the radially-contractible 
portion (18) whereby, during the engagement phase, the 

radially-contractible portion (18) of the duct (11) 
exerts a containing force on the elements (S, F) which 

are liable to project, ensuring that they are contained 
radially within the open ends (4) so that the open ends 

of the bodies (2, 3) can be engaged without interference 
from the elements (S, F). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it includes a holding structure (13) for at least  

 
one (3) of the two cup-like bodies (2, 3), characterised 

in that the pusher means (15) act on the at least one 
body (3) to expel it from the holding structure whereby 

the end-to-end engagement is achieved outside the holding 
structure (13). 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the holding structure is constituted by a tray (13) 

including a plurality of holding apertures (14) in a 
general matrix-like structure, each aperture being able 

to hold a respective at least one body (3). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 3, 
characterised in that it includes a plurality of said 

ducts (11) whereby a plurality of containers (1) may be 
formed simultaneously by the engagement of respective 

cup-like bodies (2, 3). 
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the axis of the duct (11)

they are opened apart and into which they are urged by  

 
the force exerted on them by at least one (3) of the cup-like 

bodies.
