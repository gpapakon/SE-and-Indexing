<ABSTRACT>
Process for making a sealant (sealing composition) suspension, in particular for producing subterranean sealing walls (curtains) by the single-phase process, in which bentonite, milled blast furnace slag, if desired additives for improving the processibility, if desired inert additives for increasing the bulk density, and at least one activator for the blast furnace slag are mixed with water, with a storage-stable dry mixture consisting essentially of bentonite and milled blast furnace slag being used and with the activator for the blast furnace slag being kept separate from the dry mixture until the suspension is made up.

Process for making a suspension of an impervious compound, in 
particular for constructing impervious subterraneous curtains by the 

single-phase process, wherein there are mixed with water bentonite, ground 

blast furnace slag, optionally additives to improve the processability, 
optionally inert additives to increase the bulk density, and at least one 

activator for the blast furnace slag,
 
characterised in that there is used a dry mix which is stable in storage 

and substantially comprises bentonite and ground blast furnace slag, 
wherein the activator for the blast furnace slag is kept apart from the dry 

mix until the suspension is mixed. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that a non-activated bentonite is used. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that an activated calcium bentonite is used. 
Process according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that there are admixed to the calcium bentonite, 

preferably as early as during preparation, chelating agents for Ca
2+
 ions 
and optionally other polyvalent cations and/or Ca
2+
 fillers, in place of or 
in addition to the activating agents which are known per se. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that a dry mix having additives which are known per se is 

used to improve the processability. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that a dry mix having inert additives which are known per 

se is used to increase the bulk density. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that a dry mix having additives which are known per se is 

used to increase the imperviousness. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that a pulverulent activator is used. 
Process according to Claim 8,
 
characterised in that cement is used as an activator.  

 
Process according to Claim 8,
 
characterised in that at least one alkaline earth metal hydroxide is used 

as an activator. 
Process according to Claim 10,
 
characterised in that an alkaline earth metal hydroxide having divalent or 

polyvalent ions is used. 
Process according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that Ca(OH)
2
 is used as an activator. 
Process according to Claim 8,
 
characterised in that an alkali metal compound is used as an activator. 
Process according to Claim 13,
 
characterised in that an alkali metal salt is used as an alkali metal 

compound. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 8 to 14,
 
characterised in that at last two activator substances are used as 

activators. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that an aqueous solution which contains an alkali and 

preferably has pH 
>
 11 is used as an activator. 
Process according to Claim 16,
 
characterised in that a solution which contains an alkali metal hydroxide, 

in particular an NaOH solution, is used as an activator. 
Process according to Claim 16,
 
characterised in that an alkali metal salt solution is used as the 

solution. 
Process according to Claim 18,
 
characterised in that an Na
2
SO
4
 solution is used as the solution. 
Process according to Claim 16,
 
characterised in that a solution having two or more alkali metal salts is 

used.  
 
Process according to Claim 16,
 
characterised in that a solution exhibiting NaOH and at least one alkali 

metal salt is used. 
Process according to Claim 21,
 
characterised in that a solution exhibiting NaOH and Na
2
SO
4
 is used. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 22,
 
characterised in that the activator is admixed at any time to the pre-mixed 

suspension. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 23,
 
characterised in that the activator is added only after swelling of the 

bentonite. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 24,
 
characterised in that the activator is added to the mixing water. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 25,
 
characterised in that activator is pre-mixed with water.
