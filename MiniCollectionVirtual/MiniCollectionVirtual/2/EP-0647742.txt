<ABSTRACT>
A siphon for a discharging installation with an odour seal exhibits a housing (1) which exhibits a side wall (3) with a liquid-inlet opening (2) and in whose base region (4) there is provided a liquid-outlet opening (5), the odour seal exhibiting a partition wall (10) which, with the housing walls (3, 13), forms a down channel (15) leading, initially downwards, from the inlet opening (2) to the base region (4), an adjoining upwardly extending rise channel, a deflecting channel (18) which adjoins said rise channel and passes via the inlet opening (2), and finally an outflow channel which opens downwardly into the outlet opening (5) and adjoins the deflecting channel (18). In order to permit simple cleaning of the discharge pipe system adjoining the siphon without dismantling said siphon, the housing (1) of the siphon exhibits an opening (24) which is known per se, can be closed from the outside and opens into the deflecting channel (18) and/or the adjoining outflow channel (19) (Figure 1).

Concealed siphon for a discharging installation, in particular a concealed siphon for 
washing machines, comprising a housing (1) provided with an air trap, said housing being 

provided with a sidewall (3) having a liquid intake orifice (2) and being provided with a liquid 

discharge orifice (5) arranged in its bottom region (4), wherein said air trap comprises a 
partition wall (10) which with the walls (3, 11, 12, 13) of the housing forms a fall down 

conduit (15) that first leads downward from the intake orifice (2) as far as to the bottom region 
(4), an upwardly extending rising conduit (16) adjoining the same, a diverting conduit (18) 

adjoining the latter and passing above the intake orifice (2) and finally an outflow conduit (19) 
opening downwards into the discharge orifice (5) and following upon the diverting conduit 

(18), characterized in that the housing (1) comprises an orifice (24), known per se, which is 
closeable from the outside, opening into the diverting conduit (18) and/or into the outflow 

conduit (19) adjoining the same and that there is provided a covering hood (29) surrounding 
the orifice (24) at a distance (30). 
Siphon according to claim 1, characterized in that the orifice (24) at least partially 
opens into a descending leg (18') of the diverting conduit (18) following upon the outflow 

conduit (19). 
Siphon according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the orifice (24) is formed by a 
pipe connection (27), known per se, connected to the housing (1). 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that to the intake 
orifice (2) there is connected a roughly horizontal intake connection (6) projecting outward 

from the housing (1) and that the pipe connection (27) is arranged so as to be partially 
supported at the housing (1) and partially at the intake connection (6). 
Siphon according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the pipe connection is closeable 
by means of a sealing cap (25) which screws onto the pipe connection (27) and which is 

provided with a seal (26).  
 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the covering 
hood (29) by means of a snap connection (33, 34) is attached to retention elements (32) 

arranged at the housing (1) and projecting outward from the same. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the covering 
hood (29) is open toward the front, that is, toward the sidewall (3) of the housing (1), at which 

the intake orifice (2) or at which the intake connection (6) attached to the intake orifice (2) are 
arranged. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that there is 
provided a protective hood (35) covering the covering hood (29) and at least the portion of the 

housing (1) that carries the intake orifice (2) or the intake connection (6) connected to the 
intake orifice (2). 
Siphon according to claim 8, characterized in that the protective hood (35) comprises a 
free rim (36) by which it can be slid over the covering hood (29) and at least partially over the 

housing (1). 
Siphon according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that sidewalls of the protective hood 
(35) are provided with several grooves (39) that are parallel with respect to each other and 

with respect to the front wall (37) of the protective hood (35). 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the grooves 
(39) are interrupted by slot-like recesses (39') piercing the sidewalls. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that, starting 
from the bottom region (4) of the housing (1), the anterior sidewall (13) of the housing (1), 

which wall is provided with the intake orifice (2), is arranged so as to be inclined backwards 
towards the rear wall (13) of the housing (1), accompanied by a narrowing of the cross section 

of said housing (1).
