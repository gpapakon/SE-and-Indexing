<ABSTRACT>
A surgical handpiece tip with at least two coaxially spaced electrically conductive tubes. The tubes are separated by an electrical insulator. The interior of the inner tube is used for aspiration of liquefied tissue. The distal portion of the interior tube terminates just inside of the outer tube so as to form a boiling region. Electrical current is passed between the inner and outer tube to rapidly boil any surgical fluid in the boiling region. The boiling fluid rapidly expands out of the ring between the tubes and contacts the targeted tissue, thereby liquefying the tissue and allowing the tissue to be aspirated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of minimally invasive surgery, such as
intervertebral disc and cataract surgery and more particularly to a handpiece for practicing
the liquefaction technique.The human eye in its simplest terms functions to provide vision by transmitting
light through a clear outer portion called the cornea, and focusing the image by way of the
lens onto the retina. The quality of the focused image depends on many factors including
the size and shape of the eye, and the transparency of the cornea and lens.When age or disease causes the lens to become less transparent, vision deteriorates
because of the diminished light which can be transmitted to the retina. This deficiency in
the lens of the eye is medically known as a cataract. An accepted treatment for this
condition is surgical removal of the lens and replacement of the lens function by an
artificial intraocular lens (IOL).In the United States, the majority of cataractous lenses are removed by a surgical
technique called phacoemulsification. During this procedure, a thin phacoemulsification
cutting tip is inserted into the diseased lens and vibrated ultrasonically. The vibrating
cutting tip liquifies or emulsifies the lens so that the lens may be aspirated out of the eye.
The diseased lens, once removed, is replaced by an artificial lens.Recently, a new tissue removal technique has been developed that involves the
injection of hot (approximately 45°C to 105°C) water or saline to liquefy or gellate tissue,
such as the hard lens nucleus, thereby making it possible to aspirate the liquefied tissue.
Aspiration is conducted with the injection of the heated solution and the injection of a
relatively cool solution, thereby quickly cooling and removing the heated solution. One
application of this technique is more fully described in U.S. Patent No. 5,616,120
(Andrew, et al.), The
apparatus disclosed in the publication, however, heats the solution separately from the
surgical handpiece. Temperature control of the heated solution can be difficult because the
fluid tubings feeding the handpiece typically are up to two meters long, and the heated
solution can cool considerably as it travels down the length of the tubing. The use of electrosurgical handpieces to remove tissue is known. For example,
U.S. Patent No. 5,009,656 (Reimels),
describes an electrosurgical handpiece having an inner electrode and an outer tube
separated by an insulator. Current is passed between the inner electrode and the outer tube to cause
a spark that is

<CLAIMS>
A handpiece tip (10,100) comprising:

a) an inner electrically conductive aspiration tube (12,112) having a distal
end;
b) an outer electrically conductive tube (14,114) having a distal end coaxially
spaced about the inner tube, the distal end of the outer tube extending

distally past the distal end of the inner tube;
c) an insulator (16,116) spaced between the inner tube and the outer tube;
and
d) a boiling region (18,118) formed by the outer tube between the distal end
of the outer tube and the distal end of the inner tube.
The tip of claim 1, comprising means for passing an electrical current is between the inner and
outer tube to rapidly boil any surgical fluid in the said boiling region (18,118).
The tip of claim 2, wherein the electrical current flowing across the tubes is
capable of producing a pressure pulse force of between 0.03 grams and 20.0

grams in a fluid.
The tip of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the inner tube (112) has a conical
distal end (113).
