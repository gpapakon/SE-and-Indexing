<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the thermal efficiency of a three-pass boiler which is used for combined heating of a domestic hot water accumulator and a building heating system, it is proposed to surround the second and third pass with a first water space (5) having a comparatively low water volume. The first water space (5) is at least partly separated from a second water space (7) by a boundary surface (8). Whereas the heating of the water in the first water space (5) via heat-exchanger surfaces takes place directly by means of the hot waste gases, the second water space (7) is heated via the boundary surface (8) indirectly and by means of gravity circulation. The first water space serves solely to heat the accumulator, whereas the second water space has the connections for the heating-system circuit. The connection piece (9) for the flow of the accumulator circuit is situated at the highest point of the boiler and the return connection (10) at the lowest point of the first water space (5). At the same time, the water spaces (5, 7) are interconnected in this region, so that a normal gravity-flow operation of the boiler is possible. On the other hand, when a feed pump for the accumulator circuit is switched on, the gravity flow is cut off.

Process for combined heating of a carrier medium for a
building heating on one hand and a carrier medium for a

storage accumulator (22) for industrial and drinking water
on the other hand by means of a three-pass-boiler with

inner exhaust-gas recirculation, 
characterized in that
, the heat carrier medium for heating the
accumulator (22) is taken from a first fluid chamber (5,

27) of the boiler, is supplied into the accumulator (22)
and is supplied back into the first fluid chamber (5, 27),

the fluid of the first fluid chamber (5, 27) is heated
directly with the aid of heat exchanger surfaces (3, 6) by

exhaust gases flowing through the second and/or third pass
of the boiler, in that the heat exchanger medium for the

building heating is taken from a second fluid chamber (7,
29) of the boiler, is supplied to the building heating and

returned to the second fluid chamber (7, 29), where the
heat carrier medium of the second fluid chamber (7, 29) is

primarily heated by gravity circulation with the first
fluid chamber (5, 27), and where the first fluid chamber

(5, 27) of the second fluid chamber (7, 29) is at least
partially seperated through areas of contact (8, 28) and

has a higher temperature level.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
, the fluid for the flow pipe supply (9) of
the accumulator circuit (17) is taken from the boiler in

the area of the highest level and supplied to the first
fluid chamber (5, 27) in the area of the lowest level,

where there is an open connection of the first fluid chamber
(5, 27) with the second fluid chamber (7, 29) in the

area of the supplies (9, 10). 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 2,

characterized in that
, feed pumps (20)
are provided in the area of the flow pipe (19) of the accumulator

circuit (17) and the flow pipe (25) of the heating
curcuit (18).
Boiler to perform the process according to one of the
claims 1 to 3 with a pot-shaped-fire box situated in a fire

chamber, first pass, which is surrounded by a finned profil
functioning as a heat exchanger through which the exhaust

gases created in the fire box are directed in the direction
of a burner nozzle, second pass, a secondary heating surface

functioning as a heat exchanger, third pass, through
which the exhaust gases are directed to a chimney after

flowing through the second pass, 
characterized in that
, the finned profil (3) and the secondary
heating surface (6) are surrounded by a first fluid chamber

(5, 27) comprising supplies (9, 10) for the supply and the
return of the heat exchanger medium for heating an accumulator

(22), in that the first fluid chamber (5, 27) is
surrounded by a second fluid chamber (7, 29) comprising

supplies (11, 12) for the supply and return of the heat
exchanger medium to the building heating, and in that the

first fluid chamber (5, 27) and the second fluid chamber
(7, 29) are seperated, at least partially, from one another

by means of areas of contact (8, 28), where the flow pipe
supply (9) for the accumulator circuit (17) is situated in

the region of the highest area of the boiler and the return
supply (10) for the accumulator circuit is situated in the

region of the lowest area of the first fluid chamber (5,
27) and an open connection of the fluid chambers (5, 7, 27,

29) is provided in the area of the supplies (9, 10).
