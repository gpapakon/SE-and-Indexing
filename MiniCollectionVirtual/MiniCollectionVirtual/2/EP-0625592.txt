<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the electrolytic recovery 
of silver, which is adapted for two film processing machines and 

allows the fixing baths to be connected with a silver recovery unit in 
response to the silver concentration. According to the invention a flow 

connection between the silver recovery unit and one of the fixing baths is 
alternately established within predefinable periods of tune. While the silver 

recovery unit is connected to one of the two fixing baths, values from 
which the silver concentrations can be deduced are measured by electronic 

means and compared such that the fixing bath having the higher silver 
concentration is connected to the silver recovery unit. After a predefinable 

silver concentration has been reached in one of the fixing baths the 
now connection with the silver recovery unit is maintained until the silver 

concentration has dropped below the predefined silver concentration value 
as a result of the action of the electrolysis current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the electrolytic recovery 
of silver in two film processing machines wherein, according to the 
method, the silver concentration in the electrolysis cell of a silver recovery 
unit is determined by measuring of a value indicative of such silver 
concentration and is used for connecting said processing machines. Several methods are known for determining from measuring values the silver 
concentration in fixing baths of film processing machines. For controlling electrolysis cells, for example, the voltage potentials are 
measured via a cell anode and cathode, said potentials being more or less 
proportional to the silver concentration. Also known is the measuring of 
the conductivity of the fixing solution by means of conductivity sensors. 
In EP-O 418 757 A2, for example, it is proposed that the supply of replenisher 
solution for two fixing baths from two supply tanks be controlled by 
means of a single conductivity sensor. The silver concentration can be determined with a considerably higher 
degree of precision by means of measuring electrodes which consist of a 
reference electrode, such as an Ag/AgCl electrode or the like and a measuring 
electrode, between which the potential is measured. The application of one of such methods is known for example from an 
on-line fixing bath replenishing system to which one to the processing 
machines can be connected, the fixing bath solutions being continuously 
supplied through connecting lines to an electrolytic desilvering unit where 
they are desilvered before being returned into the baths (prospectus of 
H. Stamm KG company/1991). The electrolysis current is controlled in a 
manner known per se by signals corresponding to the silver concentration  
 
value of the liquid mixture formed in the recovery unit. That value is 
either directly measured by sensors arranged in said unit or determined 
via the film lengths and widths passing through said fixing baths. In a comparable manner, a fixing bath can be replenished using an on-line 
"Ecosys F 08" unit offered by Agfa-Gevaert AG for two processing 
machines. The above method is disadvantageous in that the desilvering of each individual 
fixing bath is not carried out in accordance with the amount of silver 
introduced into the bath and corresponding to the film lengths and 
widths passed through each bath. Optimum desilvering of each individual 
fixing bath according to its actual silver concentration is not feasible 
therefore. Another disadvantage of this

in that when a predefinable silver concentration value has been 

reached in one of the fixing baths, the flow connection with the silver
