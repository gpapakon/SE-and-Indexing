<ABSTRACT>
A portable machine for performing cuts, particularly rectilinear or curvilinear cuts, in stone, marble, granite and the like, comprises a supporting member (1) arranged for movement over the top surface of a stone or the like to be machined; a frame (2) connected to the supporting member (1) with a connecting block (40), the frame (2) supporting motor means and transmission means for driving a cutting tool (5); a handle (6) for moving the machine over the surface of stone or the like to be machined; and means (8) for adjusting the sinking of the cutting tool (5) into the stone. The supporting member (1) is provided on the surface towards the stone with a plurality of rolling-ball bearings (20) to allow the free movement of the supporting member (1), frame (2) and cutting tool (5) for following a rectilinear or curvilinear path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in portable machines for 
performing cuts, particularly rectilinear and curvilinear cuts, in stone, 
marble, granite and the like. Machines by which slabs of various materials are cut along a substantially 
arbitrary path that require the use of a template for guiding the machine 
itself on the cutting tool are well known in the art. These known machines use as afore said a template for guiding the cutting 
tool, a diamond-wheel or the like, and if this is acceptable for mass 
production which entails a large number of machined pieces, this is 
absolutely unacceptable for single-piece operations both in respect of the 
set-up times and the costs for the preparation of the templates. This is 
particularly true when these operations are carried out by a craftsman who 
should change the template for each machining operation. Presently, small machines for cutting stone, marble and the like, are 
known. However, even if they are reasonably light and convenient, cuts on 
millings along arbitrary curvilinear path with the required precision can 
not be performed. It would be therefore particularly advantageous to provide a portable 
machine by which it is possible to follow an arbitrary cutting path either 
rectilinear or curvilinear, allowing the manual guidance of the cutting tool 
with a great ease and without the need of using a template. The portable machine according to the present invention basically 
comprises a frame connected to a supporting member carrying the machine 
over a slab of stone or the like to be machined, the frame carrying a motor 
for driving the cutting or milling tool and a handle for guiding the machine 
and the tool along a desired working path.  
 The supporting member carrying the machine over the slab to be machined 
is provided on the surface facing the slab with a plurality of rolling ball 
bearings having a low friction coefficient so as to allow the user to operate 
easily the machine over the top surface of the slab to be machined. In the known machines of this kind, however, the frame of the machine and 
the member supporting the same over the surface of the slab to be 
machined are angularly fixed both in azimuth and elevation and for this 
reason the shifting of the machine over the surface of the slab to be 
machined is rather difficult. Moreover, if with a machine of the known type 
it is desired to mill agroove with a variable depth or width, for instance for 
machining recesses for inlay works, such operation would be
