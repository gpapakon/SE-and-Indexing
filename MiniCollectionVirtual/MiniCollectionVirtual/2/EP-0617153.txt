<ABSTRACT>
A weft thread (1) running off from a fixed storage bobbin (2) is guided, by a compressed-air nozzle (6) and a deflecting element (16), movable transversely to the weft-insertion direction (arrow 9), to the weft-insertion device (11) of a projectile weaving machine. After each weft insertion, the weft thread (1) is deflected by the deflecting element (16) out of an extended thread path (1a) into an angled thread path (1c) and, during a subsequent weft insertion, is returned towards the extended thread path (1a). During a predetermined fraction of the weaving cycle which comprises the return of the weft thread (1) into the extended thread path (1a), the compressed-air nozzle (6) is loaded by compressed air, so that the weft thread (1) is additionally accelerated for a short time. After the return of the weft thread (1), the supply of compressed air to the compressed-air nozzle (6) is stopped for the remaining part of the weaving cycle. As a result, with a minimum requirement of compressed air and by means of a simple nozzle arrangement, a careful guidance of the weft thread is guaranteed and a "stretch beat" is prevented from occurring when the weft thread is being stretched out. The method is especially suitable for the processing of sensitive yarn material in weaving machines with a high weft-insertion capacity.

A method of influencing the motion of a weft yarn (1)
 
   which has to be drawn off a stock bobbin (2) and runs 

towards a weft insertion mechanism (11) of a loom, in particular 
a projectile loom, and at any given time in a weaving 

cycle is transferred for a weft insertion to a weft insertion 
member (14) which passes through the shed (4), where 

the weft yarn (1) is additionally accelerated at any given 
time by a compressed-air nozzle arranged between the stock 

bobbin (2) and the weft insertion mechanism (11), and after 
the weft insertion is drawn back by a predetermined length 

by a deflector element (16) movable transversely to the direction 
of weft insertion (arrow 9) and deflected locally 

from a yarn path (1a) running essentially stretched into a 
yarn path (1c) cranked like a loop, and upon a following 

weft insertion is returned from the latter at any given time 
towards the yarn path (1a) running stretched,
 
characterized in that for the additional acceleration of the 

weft yarn (1) at any given time within a predetermined fraction 
of the weaving cycle which corresponds with a starting 

phase of the weft insertion process which comprises at least 
one part of a certain period intended for the return of the 

weft yarn (1) from the cranked yarn path (1c) towards the 
yarn path (1a) running essentially stretched, the compressed 

air nozzle is acted upon by compressed air, and that after 
this return of the weft yarn (1) the compressed-air feed to 

the compressed-air nozzle (6) is blocked during the 
remaining part of the weaving cycle. 
A method as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   the compressed-air feed to the compressed-air nozzle (6) 

is so controlled that a maximum pressure of the compressed 
air, foreseen for the additional acceleration of the weft 

yarn (1), is effective essentially in the second half of the 
period intended for returning the weft yarn (1) towards the 

yarn path (1a) running stretched. 
A method as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
 
   the pressure of the compressed air, foreseen for the  

 
additional acceleration of the weft yarn (1), becomes built 

up essentially during the first half of the period intended 
for returning the weft yarn (1) towards the yarn path (1a) 

running stretched. 
A method as in one of the preceding Claims,
 
   characterized in that with respect to time the start 

of the compressed-air feed to the compressed-air nozzle (6) 
is effected before the start of the period which is intended 

for the return of the weft yarn (1) towards the stretched 
yarn path (1a), within a time interval which corresponds 

with a predetermined fraction, e.g., 10% of the aforesaid 
period. 
A method as in one of the preceding Claims,
 
   characterized in that the compressed-air feed to the 

compressed-air nozzle (6) is so controlled that a portion 
(1') of the weft yarn (1) laid upstream of the deflector 

element (16) is accelerated to a speed which corresponds 
with a predetermined fraction, e.g., half the speed of a 

portion (1") of the weft yarn (1) which is laid downstream 
of the deflector element (16) and accelerated by the weft 

insertion member (14). 
A method as in Claim 5, characterized in that
 
   the compressed-air feed to the compressed-air nozzle (6) 

is so controlled that the speed of the compressed air foreseen 
for the preacceleration of the portion (1') of yarn 

laid upstream of the deflector element (16) is reached 
essentially within the first third of the period foreseen 

for returning the weft yarn (1) towards the stretched yarn 
path (1a). 
A loom for the performance of the method as in
 
   one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that 

the compressed air nozzle (6) is connected to a control 
valve (21) which is only intended for brief activation 

within the predetermined fraction of the weaving cycle and  
 

at the start of the weft insertion process is adjustable 
from a blocking position blocking a compressed air feed into 

a flow position releasing the compressed air feed to the 
cmpressed air nozzle, and into the blocking position after 

the starting phase of the weft insertion process determined 
by the return of the deflector element (16) towards the yarn 

path (1a) running stretched, and adopts this blocking 
position until the next weft insertion. 
A loom as in Claim 7, characterized in that
 
   in the case of a weaving cycle determined in each case 

by one revolution of a control shaft (20) the fraction of 
this weaving cycle predetermined for the activation of 

the compressed air nozzle (6) corresponds with a partial 
revolution of the control shaft (20) through an angle of 

rotation (α) of from about 60° to 120°, e.g., 90°.
