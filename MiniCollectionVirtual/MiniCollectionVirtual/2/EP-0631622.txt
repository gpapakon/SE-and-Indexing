<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of detergent proteases derived from strains
of Bacillus sp. More specifically, the invention is directed towards a novel alkaline
protease obtainable from a strain of Bacillus sp. PD138. Moreover, the invention is
directed towards a process for the preparation of the protease, the use of the
protease as detergent enzyme, and detergent compositions comprising the protease
of the invention.Detergent enzymes have been marketed for more than 20 years and
are now well established as normal detergent ingredients in both powder and liquid
detergents all over the world. With the trend towards lower temperature washing,
detergent enzyme consumption has increased during late years. Enzymes used in
washing formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as
other enzymes, or mixtures hereof. Commercially most important are proteases.Detergent proteases have been developed by isolation of proteases
found in nature followed by testing in detergent formulations. Most detergent
proteases are obtained from members of the genus Bacillus. Currently new types
of proteases enter the market, offering the possibility of giving a better cost/performance
ratio at various specified conditions.Examples of commercial protease products are ALCALASE™.
ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™, all supplied by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark. These
and similar enzyme products from other commercial sources are active in detergent
solutions, i.e. at pH values in the range of from 8 to 11 and in the presence of
sequestering agents, surfactants and bleaching agents such as sodium borate. The
ALCALASE™ protease is produced by strains of the species Bacillus licheniformis.
The ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™ proteases are obtained by cultivation of strains
of alkalophilic Bacilli.It is an object of the present invention to provide novel detergent
proteases with improved washing performance at high pH and high ion strength.Accordingly, in its first aspect, the invention provides a protease having
an apparent molecular weight as determined by SDS-PAGE of 28 kD, pl above 9.5, pH optimum
above pH 10 (at 25°C and with casein as substrate), temperature optimum in the range of from 45 to 55°C (at pH 9.5 and with casein as substrate),
and immunochemical properties identical to those of a protease
obtainable from the strain Bacillus sp. PD138, NCIMB 40338.In a second aspect, the invention relates to an isolated biologically pure
culture of a strain of Bacillus sp. PD138. In a
more specific aspect, the invention relates to a
