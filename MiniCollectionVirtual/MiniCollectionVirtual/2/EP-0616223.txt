<ABSTRACT>
The testing contactor (1) for small-size semiconductor 
devices (D) having plural electric connection leads (L) 

comprises, for each lead (L), two contact elements (8,10) 
laid side-by-side, of which only one (8) is held against 

the lead (L), and a reed connection element (12) held 
against the lead (L), and the other contact element (10) 

held away from the lead (L). This provides a contact of 
the Kelvin type, suitable for testing with large 

currents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a testing contactor for
semiconductor devices, specifically power devices.Semiconductor devices comprise a more or less oblate
parallelepipedic body whence electrical connection leads
are led out. It is common practice to test such devices,
before their delivery for sale, one at a time to check
that their performance is up to specifications. To this
aim, their leads are connected electrically to an
automatic test apparatus whereby, inter alia,
predetermined currents are supplied across lead pairs,
and the voltage drop is measured across the two leads
inside the device. Similar tests are also performed
manually on individual semiconductor devices for design
verification, specific sampled quality checks, or other
purposes.Usually, the test current is supplied with the
intermediary of a contactor which carries plural electric
contact elements spring loaded toward the leads. The
voltage drop is measured across these contact elements.Power devices may require, however, relatively large
currents (on the order of some amperes), such that the
contact resistance between the leads and electric contact
elements becomes significant. Measuring the voltage drop
across the electric contact elements rather than across
the leads means to get a value made greater by the two
contact resistances.This would distort the test measurements to a largely
unforeseeable extent, since contact resistance is
dependent on such deeply varying factors as pressure,
actual contact area, surface finish, ambient temperature,
cleanliness, etc. To avoid measuring errors, so-called Kelvin contacts are
known to be used.Kelvin contacts are in practice dual contacts placed
side-by-side; one contact element (the "forcing" contact)
is used for power supply, and the other contact element
(the "sensing" contact) is used for connection to the
voltage meter. The voltage drop due to contact resistance
through the sensing contacts is negligible, because
negligible is the current flowed therethrough.US-A-4 887 969 discloses an IC housing comprising a
socked body having an IC package accomodating space
therein; an IC mounting table disposed in the IC package
accomodating space and adapted to support an IC package
thereon; and a plurality of contacts planted in a socked
body portion at the periphery of the mounting table; the
plurality of contacts each having a resilient contact
piece, IC terminals of the IC package, when the IC
package is supported on the mounting table, being able to
contact with the resilient contact pieces of
