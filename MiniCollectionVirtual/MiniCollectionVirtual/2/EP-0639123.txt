<ABSTRACT>
Mass spring system for use in a vehicle, in which the sprung mass (4) is connected to a support (1) by means of at least one bearing arm (2) and a spring leg (6). The mass spring system is equipped with an antiroll/pitch mechanism comprising an auxiliary spring (18), of which the axis is movable, of which auxiliary spring (18) one end (16) is connected to the bearing arm (2) by means of a rod system (10) for exerting thereon a countermoment corresponding to the load ( DELTA P) acting on the support (1). The auxiliary spring (18) can be moved parallel to itself, or is fixed by one end (17) to the sprung mass (4), while the other end (16) can pass through a circular path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mass spring system for use in 
a vehicle, in which the unsprung mass is connected to a 
support by means of at least a bearing arm, which mass spring 
system is equipped with an anti-roll/pitch mechanism 
comprising a spring, of which one end is connected to the 
support and the other end to the bearing arm, while the axis 
of the spring can be moved by moving one of the two ends of 
the spring for exerting on the bearing arm a coutermoment 
corresponding to the load (Δp) acting on the support wherein 
the force component of the spring depends on the distance 
between the one end and the other end of the spring. Such a mass spring system disclosing the features of the preamble 
of claim 1, is known from DE-A-3,707,085. 
Variable reaction forces are exerted on the wheel suspension 
system during braking or acceleration of a vehicle and when 
negotiating bends, which leads to rolling or pitching 
movements of the vehicle. These rolling and pitching movements 
of the vehicle have an adverse effect on the ride, the 
steering of the vehicle and the safety. It is therefore 
desirable to take measures to counteract such rolling and 
pitching movements. The stabilisation system for counteracting 
said rolling and pitching movements, as known from the above-mentioned 
DE-A-3,707,085, has the drawback that the 
spring is compressed or extended on movement of the axis. 
Therefore, in the countermoment to be supplied by the 
spring not only the moment arm, but also the force 
component supplied by the spring changes, with the 
result that the control system for stabilising the rolling and 
pitching movements becomes more complex. Movement of the axis 
of the spring in a direction in which the spring is 
compressed further also requires power, which has to be 
supplied in one way or another. The object of the invention is 
to provide an anti-roll/pitch mechanism forming part of the 
wheel suspension system and requiring a minimum of power,  
 
in which the control for supplying the desired counter-moment 
can be simplified. This object is achieved according to the invention by 
that the movable end of the spring can pass through a circular 
path, lying on the surface of a sphere, while the fixed end of 
the spring lies in the centre point of said sphere. WO92/01170 discloses a spring element having an end which 
moves on a predetermined path of movement. Herein the spring 
element is a lune shaped spring element with arcuate sides 
which are bent in a bowed configuration so that the spring
