<ABSTRACT>
In the device proposed, a heat exchanger (1) is connected by a transfer line (2) to at least one heat-transfer element (3). In the heat exchanger (1), heat transfer takes place from a stream of heat-containing fluid (4) from the object to be cooled and/or dehumidified to a carrier fluid flowing in the transfer line (2). A circulating pump (5) pumps the carrier fluid round a closed loop. The purpose of the heat-transfer element (3) is to discharge heat, via the carrier fluid, into the ground, the groundwater or another body of water in order to produce a cooling effect.
