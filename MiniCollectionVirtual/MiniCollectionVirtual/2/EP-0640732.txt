Apparatus for applying an adhesive, thin-film bed
of mortar or the like to a face of a hollow building

block, hollow brick or the like, having an essentially
V-shaped box (4) that extends substantially over the

width of the face to be worked on, and at whose V-shaped,
downwardly directed tip (5) there is provided an

applicator slot (6) with an applicator roll (2) which is
arranged therein and has regularly protruding applicator

profiling, characterized in that the applicator roll (2)
has at the outer circumference a saw-tooth profile that

is essentially V-shaped in axial longitudinal section and
is formed from a multiplicity of discs (3) that are

arranged alongside one another and taper in a V shape at
the outer circumference.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, having a roll
wiper, characterized in that the wiper (7) is arranged in

the mortar box (4) and has a matching profile matched to
the profile of the roll.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the wiper (7) is fitted to a displaceable wall (7'),

which runs at a predefined distance parallel to the rear
longitudinal wall (13) of the mortar box (4) and, with

the rear longitudinal wall (8), forms a receiving chamber
(9) for wiped-off mortar material.
Apparatus having a device for closing the
applicator slot, according to at least one of Claims 1 to

3, characterized in that closure slides (11) are
additionally arranged along the front and rear

longitudinal walls (12, 13), and are brought into the
closed position for filling and/or during the 

transporting of the filled box (4).
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the effective marginal edge (14) of the closure

slide (11) is essentially matched to the profile of the
applicator roll (2).
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the applicator gap (15) which

is formed between the front longitudinal wall (12), or a
setting stop (23) arranged thereon, and the profile of

the applicator roll (2) is larger than the inlet gap (16)
between the rear longitudinal wall (13) and the profile

of the applicator roll.
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the
 application width (A) of
the device can be matched to the thickness of the wall.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in
that a partition wall (17), which shortens the application

width (A), can be pushed into the box (4) at various
positions which each correspond to different wall

thicknesses.
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the partition wall (17) can be pushed in at an angle

to the vertical.
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1
to 9, characterized in that a device (18), which holds

the apparatus in the working position, is arranged on the
box (4).
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized in
that an essentially obliquely downwardly directed handle

(18), which can support the box, is arranged on at least
one of the two longitudinal walls (12, 13).
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1
to 11, characterized in that in order to guide the

applicator roll (2), a guide, which offers a lateral stop
on the wall, is arranged at one end (19) of the roll.
Apparatus according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the guide (20) comprises a guide wheel (25).
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterized in
that a mixing device (7) is arranged in the mortar 

box (4) .
