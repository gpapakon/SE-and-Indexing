<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a two package coating 
composition as a clearcoat for the multi-layer coating of articles, 
more specifically it is directed to a coating composition 
comprising a polycarbodiimide. Multi-layer coating systems were developed to satisfy a need for 
improved aesthetics of the coated substrate, especially 
automobiles. By applying a relatively thin pigmented layer, termed 
the "basecoat", and then overcoating with a thicker, unpigmented 
layer as a topcoat, termed the "clearcoat" it was possible to 
achieve a glossy coating with good appearance, weatherability, 
anti-solvent and chemical resistances and anti-discoloring 
resistances. In order to obtain the desired appearance of the coating it is 
necessary to add a rheology control agent like fumed silica, 
bentone clays or gel particles to the topcoat composition. These systems are described for example in U.S. Pat. No's 4,493,914 
NAD microgel, 4,377,661 Crosslinked microgel particles, 4,455,331 
silica, 4,526,910 silica, 4,558,075 Bentone Clay, and 4,620,994 
Bentone Clay. In addition, in a multi-layer coating system it is necessary that 
the basecoat have "strike in" resistance. By "strike in" 
resistance is meant the ability of the basecoat to resist attack by  
 
the solvents in the topcoat composition. The strike in is a 
problem because the automobile manufacturers generally wish to 
apply the topcoat composition in a color plus clear system by a 
"wet-on-wet" technique. By this is meant that the basecoat 
composition is applied to the substrate followed by the topcoat 
composition and then a single baking step is utilized to cure the 
composite coating. The topcoat "striking in" to the basecoat is 
particularly undesirable since it adversely affects alignment of 
the metallic pigment. In highly pigmented colors the non-metallic 
pigment particles can provide the physical barrier to prevent 
strike in. But in silver and light metallic colors there is 
insufficient pigment to prevent strike in. The rheology control 
agent or a filler pigment must be used to prevent the strike in. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,543 discloses a clear topcoat composition 
comprising a film-forming acrylic polymer and internally cross-linked 
polymer microgel particles to overcome the above-mentioned 
disadvantages. The object of the present invention was to provide a coating 
composition as a clearcoat which does not need the addition of a 
conventional rheology control agent or the use of microgel 
particles and which shows improved
