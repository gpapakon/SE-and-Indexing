<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for automatically observing the 
behavior of animals using at least one automatic 

identification unit. The identification unit can be mounted at 
several places in a space where domestic animals are housed, 

for instance the entrance of the milk parlor (14), a feeding 
station (10,11) or a drinking unit (12). 
Thus the number of visits of an animal to a milk parlor (14), 
feeding station (10,11) and drinking unit (12) can be registered. At the 

same time, it is possible to register the time and the 
duration of each visit. Behavioral patterns can be recorded. 

By means of analysis software, deviations in the individual 
animal-specific pattern can be signaled and pronouncements can 

be made about deviations in the sphere of animal health and 
fertility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for automatically
observing the behavior of animals. The invention also relates
to an apparatus for automatically observing the behavior of
animals comprising one or more automatic identification devices
which are adapted to automatically recognize animals provided
with a suitable identification label in a number of
predetermined zones in a space where animals are housed, and
which generate a signal upon recognition of an animal; at least
one registration unit which is coupled with the identification
devices and stores the signals provided by the identification
devices.Automatic recognition of animals is already employed on a
large scale in stock farming.British patent application 2,076,259 discloses such a
method and apparatus for determining the extent of activity of
animals, such as cows. For that purpose, each animal has been
fitted with a detector which detects the number of movements of
the animal and converts them into a number. Together with an
identification code, the number can be read out electronically
by means of a transceiver. From a cow's motion activity as
expressed by the number, it can be derived whether the cow is
estrous.In the known systems for the automatic recognition of
animals, typically use is made of a system which comprises a
transmitter and a receiver or a combined transmitter/receiver
(transceiver) and which generates an electromagnetic or
magnetic field in one or more predetermined zones. The animals
to be recognized are each fitted with an electronic or magnetic
responder which contains a unique code for the animal in
question. The code of such a responder can be detected by the
receiver or transceiver as soon as the animal, and thus the 
responder of the animal, is located in one of the predetermined
zones.According to the known technique, the detection of an
animal at a certain location is subsequently used to initiate a
certain action, such as for instance the administration of
feed, the automatic application of a milk claw of a milking
machine, opening and/or closing one or more gates, measuring
the animal's weight, et cetera.A system for automatically recognizing, for instance,
animals is generally described in applicant's French patent
7732938. Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,617,876 discloses a system
especially adapted for automatically determining the weight of
a cow after it has been electronically identified is a feed
stall.With domestic animals, certain behavioral characteristics
are known to proceed according to more or less fixed

<CLAIMS>
A method for automatically observing the behavior of
animals, whereby in the space where the animals

are housed, at least one antenna device of an automatic
identification device is arranged, which is capable of

automatically identifying animals provided with an
identification means as soon as they are located in a

predetermined zone near the antenna device, characterized in that the
number of visits per animal or per group of animals to a

predetermined zone per period of time is registered.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that also
the duration of the number of visits per period of time is

determined, per visit and/or cumulatively.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the order in which the animals visit a predetermined zone per

period of time is determined.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the data relating to a period of time

are compared with data relating to other periods of time, so
as to enable deviations to be ascertained.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the data obtained are combined with

other available quantities regarding the animal which are
conventionally determined, so as to detect deviations of the

animal reagarding health and/or reproduction. 
Apparatus for automatically observing the behavior of
animals comprising one or more automatic identification devices

which are adapted to automatically recognize animals provided
with a suitable identification label in a number of

predetermined zones in a space where animals are housed, and
which generate a signal upon recognition of an animal; at least

one registration unit which is coupled with the identification
devices and stores the signals provided by the identification

devices, characterized in that the registration unit stores the
signals provided by the identification devices together with a

time signal whereby the registration device is provided with or
is coupled with a processing apparatus which, in use, determines

the number of visits per animal or per group of animals to a
predetermined zone per period of time on the basis of the stored

signals. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that the
registration device is provided with or is coupled with a

processing apparatus adapted to process the signals into
statistical data and to compare them with previous signals.
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the
processing apparatus is coupled with a signaling device

adapted to signal a significant deviation between the signals
being compared.
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in
that the processing apparatus has one or more inputs to which

other quantities regarding each individual animal are
provided.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7-9,
characterized in that the processing apparatus is adapted to

distinguish signals coming from animals belonging to different
groups and, after the signals have been processed or not, to

compare them with each other.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7-10,
characterized in that the processing apparatus is a computer

which has been programmed with suitable software.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 7-11,
characterized in that the registration device is part of a
