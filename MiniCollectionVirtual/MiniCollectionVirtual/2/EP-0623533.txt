<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a method for transporting workpiece carriers (55) and a conveyor device (150) for carrying out the method, in which method the workpiece carriers (55) are fed by means of driven drag belts, as a result of rectilinear and deflecting transport movements, to at least one manual workstation (1 to 3) assigned to the conveyor device (150) and/or to at least one automatic station (5 to 9). The conveyor device (150) comprises longitudinally and transversely oriented linear units (10 to 27) connected to one another by means of deflection units (30 to 47), the deflection units (30 to 47) being designed in such a way that the individual workpiece carriers (55) fed are further transported rectilinearly therein by program control as a function of the destination or, deflected at an acute angle relative to the rectilinear transport movement by means of control slides provided, can be fed to the next linear unit or deflection unit.
