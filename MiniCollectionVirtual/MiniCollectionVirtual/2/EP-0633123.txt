<ABSTRACT>
A method for blow molding a tubular container comprising the steps of blowing blow air into a parison to shape a tubular 
container (3), forming discharging ports (32) in that part of an unnecessary portion of a wall surface of the tubular container located 

opposite to a blow-in port (33) for blow air, and continuing to supply blow air so as to shorten cooling time for a molded 
piece after blow molding and to efficiently mold molded pieces superior in dimensional accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for blow-molding a
tube container and, more particularly, to a blow-molding method
which enables one to shorten the time for cooling moldings
immediately after being blow-molded and to effectively produce
moldings having good dimensional accuracy.In molding a tube container from a thermoplastic resin
according to blow molding technique, it has been conducted to
pierce the upper portion of a parison having been melt extruded
from an extruder with a blow nozzle for introducing blow air,
and blow a compressed air into the parison through the nozzle,
or to introduce a compressed air into the parison from the
upper portion or lower portion in the axial direction to
thereby press the parison against the wall of a mold for
shaping a closed-end cylindrical container, followed by
cooling the container, taking it out of the mold, and cutting
the lower portion thereof to produce a tube container.The thus molded tube container is engaged with a cap, and
the capped tube container is fed to a filling machine. Then,
the tube container is filled with contents through the cut
portion, and the cut end is sealed. The resulting tube
containers are then brought to the market.Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. S59-3260
discloses a blow molding method for producing hollow containers,
in which nip-pressing plates located at the upper position of a
split mold for holding a softened parison are not directly in
contact with each other but are formed partly with a space
therebetween, the nip-pressing plates co-work to nip the
parison, the thus-sealed parison is pierced at its side wall 
with a blow nozzle, blow air is continuously fed through the
blow nozzle to shape a hollow container, then the space portion
of said nip-pressing plates are broken by the pressure of blow
air to form a discharge outlet through which the pressing fluid
filling the mold is discharged.As another conventional process for blow molding a hollow
container such as a tube container, blow air introduced through
a blowing inlet presses the softening-state parison against the
wall of the mold to shape a tube container, then is discharged
through a discharge outlet formed above the blow nozzle-pierced
portion. However, since the molded tube container has a long
and narrow form with a closed end, the blow air is discharged
before suficiently flowing within the tube container.
Therefore, the blow air used for shaping the tube container
does not flow but remains in the lower portion of the
container. Thus, subsequent

<CLAIMS>
A method for blow-molding tubular containers which comprises introducing
blow air into a parison to shape the tubular container; making the thickness

thin of a part of the wall which is an unnecessary portion of the tubular
container and which is located at the opposite side to an inlet for introducing

blow air by the pressure of blow air continoulsy introduced; breaking
the wall where the thickness having been made thin to form a discharge

outlet for blow air; and further continously introducing blow air.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein blow air is
introduced into the parison to shape the tubular container while forming

the discharge outlet in a part of the wall outside a cutting position of the
tube container and blow air is continuously supplied.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein blow air is
introduced in a horizontal blowing manner in which the wall of the parison

extruded from an extruder is pierced with a blow nozzle through which
blow air is introduced into the parson.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein blow air is
introduced in a vertical blowing manner in which blow air is introduced in

the axial direction of the parson extruded from an extruder.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein the blow air is
introduced through a blow nozzle having four openings facing upward,

downward, rightward and leftward, respectively. 
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein the discharge
outlet is formed in a part of the side wall located below the cutting position.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein two tubular
containers are blow-molded in a bottom-to-bottom symmetrical mode, and

an inlet for blow air is formed in the outer side of the top of one tubular
container while the discharge outlet for blow air is formed in the outer side

of the top of the other tubular container.
A method for blow-molding as set forth in claim 1, wherein two tubular
containers having the bottom thereof on both ends are blow-molded in a

top-to-top symmetrical mode with an unnecessary portion to be cut off
therebetween, and an inlet for blow air is formed in the unnecessary portion

between the two tops of the tubular containers and the discharge
outlet for blow air is formed outside the cutting line located at both ends.
