<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons
in the presence of an acid catalyst, and to the catalyst itself.The acid-catalyzed alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons with
olefins is a well known process in the preparation of high-octane
products to be added to gasolines for improving their
characteristics.This reaction can be conducted using strong mineral acids, in
particular concentrated sulphuric acid or anhydrous hydrofluoric
acid, as catalyst.This acids are used in excess over the feed mixture and result in
the formation of oligomers and a large quantity of fluorinated and
sulphonated by-products. In addition, hydrofluoric acid is a low-boiling
liquid (B.P. = 19°C) which in the case of accidental
escape from the reactor can form extremely corrosive acid clouds
difficult to eliminate. Sulphuric acid, which requires a reaction
temperature of less than 10°C to maintain a sufficiently high
product quality, forms high viscosity emulsions which are
difficult to mix, and also results in the formation of large
quantities of sulphonated compounds which involve costly disposal.To avoid the aforesaid problems it has been sought to use solid 
catalysts. In particular, US 3851004, US 4384161, US 3647916 and
US 5073665 describe the use of Y and X zeolites exchanged with
salts of metals pertaining to the lanthanum group. These
catalysts do not exhibit a sufficiently high productivity, in
terms of quantity of the alkylated product, to make their
industrial application interesting. To this must be added the
short duration of the catalytic cycle and a reduction in catalyst
properties during successive regeneration operations.FR 2631956 describes the use of beta zeolite in acid form as an
alkylation catalyst. Again in this case the results achieved do
not seem to be promising for its use at an industrial level.Catalyst systems based on Lewis acids, mainly AlCl3 and BF3,
supported on inert oxides have also been proposed (US 4918255, US
4384161, WO 900053, WO 900054, US 3855343, US 4935577 and US
5012039). The best results seem to be obtained with boron
trifluoride with added traces of water, but problems remain
regarding the system stability under the working conditions, due
mainly to active phase loss.It is also known to use trifluoromethanesulphonic acid as a
catalyst for hydrocarbon alkylation with olefins. US 3970721, US
4118433, GB 1463320 and CA1020590 describe the use of this acid as
an additive for sulphuric acid or hydrofluoric acid to improve
their catalytic properties. The improvement
