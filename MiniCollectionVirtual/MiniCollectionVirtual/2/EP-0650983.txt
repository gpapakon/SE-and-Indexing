<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for producing polybutadiene 
latices and homologs employs metal chelating agents and 

polymerization initiators during the emulsion 
polymerization of diene monomers and not chain transfer 

agents and electrolytes. Said process proceeds until 
substantially all of the diene monomers have polymerized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
polydiene latices. Particularly, a novel process for 
producing polybutadiene latices and homologs thereof is 
disclosed. Said novel process employs metal chelating 
agents and polymerization initiators but not chain-transfer 
agents and electrolytes during the emulsion polymerization 
of diene monomers which results in favorable polydiene 
latex production. Polydienes, such as polybutadiene, are a well 
known class of synthetic rubbers. They are often 
characterized as having high abrasion resistances as well 
as favorable flow properties. Because of their properties, 
synthetic rubbers are a desirable component in many 
commercial applications. Such applications include impact 
modifiers for plastics, conveyor belts, shoe soles as well 
as automobile tires. Polydienes are commonly prepared by emulsion 
polymerization techniques. A simple recipe for emulsion 
polymerization comprises four ingredients: a monomer, a 
continuous phase (e.g., water), an emulsifier (e.g., sodium 
soap) and an initiator (e.g., potassium persulfate). 
Obtaining satisfactory polymerizations may be achieved by 
charging a reaction vessel with the above-referenced 
ingredients, removing atmospheric oxygen and maintaining 
temperatures at about 65°C. As a result of the above, the 
rate of conversion of monomer to polymer is about 10% per  
 
hour at about 65°C. Further, with increased amounts of 
initiator, the reaction rate will increase until it reaches a 
maximum. In addition to the four ingredients described 
above, it is often conventional to employ a fifth ingredient, 
namely, chain-transfer agents/modifiers such as 
mercaptans. The mechanism by which mercaptans work is 
as follows: Growing polymer molecules are reduced by 
removing hydrogen from the mercaptan's sulfhydryl group. 
The polymerization of the reduced polymer molecule is 
terminated and an RS· radical (derived from the mercaptan) 
is formed. Said RS· radical is capable of adding to a 
monomer molecule and thus initiating additional polymer 
formation. Further, mercaptans serve as polymerization 
accelerators when a persulfate is the initiator. When the 
mercaptan is omitted, polymerization rates are slow and 
polymer production is low. Accordingly, the first aspect of the instant 
invention is based on the discovery of a novel process for 
producing high molecular weight polydiene latices and 
particularly polybutadiene latices as well as homologs 
derived therefrom by employing metal chelating agents such 
as
