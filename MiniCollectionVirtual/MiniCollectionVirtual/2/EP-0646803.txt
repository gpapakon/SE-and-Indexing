<ABSTRACT>
A boundary scan test circuit comprises a plurality of 
register cells correspondingly to external pins of a 

semiconductor device, the register cells being coupled 
together to form a shift register during a test operation 

mode. The register cells includes a first selector for 
selecting one of a parallel input data, serial input data 

and a code signal, a first register for latching the output 
of the first selector to output a serial data to be input to 

a succeeding register cell, a second register for latching 
the output of the first selector, a second selector for 

selecting the parallel data or the output of the second 
register to output parallel data. The code signal is 

determined based on corresponding one of bits of ID code of 
the semiconductor device. The ID code is output from the 

register cells without providing an ID code register, 
resulting in a simple construction of the register cells and 

a reduced chip area for the semiconductor device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device 
having a boundary scan test circuit and, more particularly, 
to an improvement on data registers in a boundary scan test 
circuit of a semiconductor integrated circuit. In a test for semiconductor devices which are 
fabricated by using advanced technology such as surface 
mounting, tape automated bonding, a multichip module and a 
complicated ASIC, there is a problem that all nodes of each 
IC tip mounted on the circuit board or molded in a package 
cannot be tested by a conventional test using an IC tester. A boundary scan test is one of methods for determining 
whether or not a semiconductor device mounted on a circuit 
board is suitably fabricated. The boundary scan test is 
used to examine that each of designated IC chips is properly 
mounted on a circuit board, that all connection pins of each 
IC chip are properly connected to corresponding terminal of 
the circuit board, and that an internal logic circuit of  
 
each IC chip provides a predetermined function. Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view showing the 
structure of a semiconductor device in which a boundary scan 
test is carried out. As shown in this drawing, the 
semiconductor device is provided with connection pins 
composed of input pins 53 and output pins 53a. Boundary 
scan register cells 31 on the input side are disposed 
between the input pins 53 and an internal logic circuit 38, 
while boundary scan register cells 31a on the output side 
are disposed between the internal logic circuit 38 and the 
output pins 53a. In an ordinary (normal) operation mode, 
each of the register cells 31 transmits input data from 
associated one of the input pins to the internal logic 
circuit 38 as it is, while each of the register cells 31a 
transmits output data obtained from the internal logic 
circuit 38 to associated one of the output pins 53a as it 
is. All of the boundary scan register cells 31 and 31a form 
a single shift register 60 when serially connected to each 
other as shown in Fig. 1. Resulting from such a 
construction, in a test operation mode, a set of test 
signals are input through a test data input terminal TDI or 
directly input to input pins 53 in accordance with one of 
the test operation modes, and then supplied to the internal 
logic circuit 38. Also, test data from the internal logic  
 
circuit 38 are output through a test data output terminal 
TDO or are directly output from output pins 53a. Other than 
the register cells 31 and 31a, there are provided an 
identificat
