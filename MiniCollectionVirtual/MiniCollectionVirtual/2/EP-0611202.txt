<ABSTRACT>
The magneto-optical reproducing head for magnetic-tape reproduction apparatus is a multitrack head which includes a magneto-optical layer (32) intended for the reproduction of very narrow tracks (width and pitch both less than 15 micrometers) and the special feature of which is that it is continuous over the width of the head. The reproducing beam illuminates the head very close to the linear gap (34') adjacent to the continuous layer. The latter is preferably magnetically anisotropic so as to limit the crosstalk between tracks. The light beam (12) modulated by the magneto-optical layer impinges on a linear photosensitive detector and tracking, facilitated by the fact that the layer is continuous, is effected by moving the detector relative to the image projected by the beam onto the detector, without moving the head relative to the magnetic tape.

Read head intended for reading, on a magnetic
recording medium (20), parallel magnetic tracks which

are arranged at a spacing of less than around 15
micrometres, this head comprising for this purpose a

magneto-optic transducer (18) comprising a thin
magneto-optic layer (32) close to which the magnetic

medium can travel, and a narrow linear gap (34')
adjacent to this thin layer, with general direction

parallel to the plane of the medium and transverse to
its direction of travel, the magneto-optic layer (32)

extending continuously along the linear gap over a
width corresponding to a large number of parallel

magnetic tracks, and means (10, 14, 16) being provided
in order to direct a light beam onto this layer along a

line (52) parallel to the gap (34') and very close
thereto, characterized in that the magneto-optic layer

is magnetically anisotropic and exhibits an axis of
easy magnetization parallel to the narrow linear gap.
Read head according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the light beam is concentrated onto the

magneto-optic layer at a distance of less than around
10 to 15 micrometres from that edge of the layer past

which the magnetic medium to be read can travel.
Read head according to either of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the light beam is focused onto

the magneto-optic layer by a cylindrical lens.
Read head according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the magneto-optic layer 

is deposited on a main surface of the head which is
parallel to the plane of the recording medium when the

head is being used.
Read head according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the magneto-optic layer is

deposited on a main surface which extends in a
transverse plane with respect to the plane of the

recording medium when the head is being used.
Apparatus for the optical reading of magnetic
recording media which comprise tracks less than 15

micrometres wide and having a pitch spacing of less
than 15 microns, the apparatus being characterized in

that it comprises a read head according to one of the
preceding claims, means for making the medium travel in

a plane parallel to the narrow gap and in a transverse
direction with respect to the said general direction of

the gap, and optoelectronic means for separately
detecting the variations in the modulation of the beam

which are due to the travelling of each track of the
recording medium past the read head.
Reading apparatus according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the light beam modulated by the

continuous magneto-optic layer is directed onto a
linear photosensitive detector with several elementary

photosensitive sensors (24), an image of this
modulation being formed on the detector in such a way

that to each track of the magnetic tape there
corresponds one or more respective sensors.
