<ABSTRACT>
A device for use during endoscopic surgery for temporarily maintaining an open passageway through a body wall into a body cavity having a main hollow tube (20), a pair of extendable flukes (22, 24) pivotably mounted on the tube (20), a second hollow tube (26) for camming the flukes (22, 24) open and clamping means (28) for engagement with the skin of a patient and a third hollow tube (30) for compressing the flukes (22, 24) in order that the device may be inserted into and removed from the incision.

<DESCRIPTION>
Great strides are being made in various areas of human 
surgery through the use of electronics and mechanical 
engineering principles. One such area is in endoscopic 
surgery or what is also called video surgery. The technique 
employs an external miniaturized video camera attached by 
fiber optic tubes to a light source and a telescopic lens, 
both of which are inserted as a unit through a small 
incision made in a patient's body. The camera projects a 
picture taken within the body and illuminated by the light 
source onto a video screen. Other surgical instruments such 
as scalpels, retractors and the like, which are specially 
designed for endoscopic surgery, are inserted through 
separate incisions in the patient. The surgeon does not view the operative field per se, 
but rather views the picture on the video screen while 
performing surgery. While the technique is referred to generically as 
endoscopic or video surgery, the equipment lends itself to a 
number of specific types of surgeries: arthroscopic 
(joints), angioscopic (blood vessels), laparoscopic (the 
abdomen), and thoracoscopic (the chest). The benefits derived from this type of surgery are 
startling. The process, in some forms, is almost bloodless. 
Large ugly scars are eliminated. The process is much less 
traumatic and painful to the patient than open surgery. The 
patient leaves the hospital in a few days, and often the 
same day, as with some arthroscopic procedures. One problem exists, however, in the use of modern 
endoscopic equipment: the location and alignment of the 
instruments relative to the surgical field are critical.  
 
The viewing lens and the light source must be maintained 
in a fixed, aligned position relative to the field. A 
fiber optic cable or rod inserted in a small incision 
through the akin and muscle is prone to misalignment and 
withdrawal unless it is held in place by a surgical 
assistant. This is not only tiring to the assistant if 
the surgical procedure is lengthy, but not totally 
satisfactory, since maintaining steadiness over lengthy 
periods is extremely difficult. Also the presence of the 
assistant and his hands in close proximity to where the 
surgeon is actually manipulating instruments can be 
bothersome to the surgeon. Attempts to remedy the problem have been made by the 
provision of hollow guides which are inserted into the 
incision and through which the fiber optic rod or cable is 
passed. One such guide comprising the features of the pre-characterising 
portion of claim 1 is shown in

<CLAIMS>
A device for use during endoscopic surgery 
for temporarily maintaining an open passageway 

through a body wall into a body cavity the device 
comprising:
 
   a main hollow tube (20) having a central axis 

and a leading end insertable through the wall into 
the cavity,
 
   a pair of extendable flukes (22, 24) pivotably 

mounted on the leading end of the main hollow tube,
 
   a second hollow tubular member (26) slidable 

within the main hollow tube (20) for camming the 
flukes away from the central axis and into an 

extended position to engage the interior of the wall 
and for providing an open passageway into the cavity, and
 
   clamping means (28) movably mounted on the main 

hollow tube for engagement with the exterior of the 
body wall to clamp the device to the wall when the 

flukes are in the extended clamping position against 
the interior of the wall, characterised by
 
   means (31) for pivoting the clamping means 

relative to the central axis to adjust the angle of 
the device relative to the body wall.  

 
Device according to Claim 1 wherein there is a 
third tube (30) slidable on the main hollow tube into 

engagement with the flukes to compress them toward 
the main hollow tube to enable the device to be 

inserted into and removed from the body cavity. 
Device according to Claim 1 wherein there are 
means (32) for preventing movement between the second 

hollow tubular member and the maim hollow tube when 
the second hollow tubular member has cammed the 

flukes into the extended position. 
Device according to Claim 1 wherein there are 
means (34) for securing a medical instrument in the 

second hollow tubular member. 
Device according to Claim 1 wherein the clamping 
means (28) is rotatable on the main tubular body and 

pivotable about an axis extending transversely of the 
main tubular body. 
Device according to Claim 1 wherein the clamping 
means (28) and the means (31) for pivoting it are 

secured to and slide with the second hollow tubular 
member. 
Device according to Claim 3 wherein the means 
for preventing movement (34) is a split collet and 

nut (56).  
 
Device according to Claim 4 wherein the medical 
instrument clamping means is a split collet and nut 

(56) on the second hollow tubular member.
