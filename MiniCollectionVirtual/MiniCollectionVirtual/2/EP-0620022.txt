<ABSTRACT>
A removable stylet for use in the introduction of 
cannulae (82) into a vessel (94) or chamber of a body for medical 

procedures, and a retrograde coronary sinus perfusion cannula 
using such stylet. The stylet is used to guide the cannula 

during insertion, and includes a proximal relatively stiff end (26) 
that can be manually manipulated by the attending physician to 

guide the stylet. On the distal end of the stylet is a relatively 
flexible portion (36) that can be shaped into various curves and 

which is form-retaining while retaining flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an introducer stylet for medical cannulation
comprising a handle for manipulation by a user, and elongated guide means affixed
to and extending from said handle, said guide means being of shape-retaining
construction and of uniform construction and geometry throughout its length.An introducer stylet of this type has become known WO-A-89 10 155 and
also from US-A-4,983,169.Cannulae with introducer stylets are used for
introduction into various organs of the body to introduce or
withdraw fluids. One such use is a retrograde coronary sinus
perfusion cannulae used in connection with open heart surgery.
The cannula itself may be flexible, but the stylet within the
cannula has sufficient rigidity that the combined cannula and
stylet may be manipulated by a handle on the cannula to project
into the selected organ of the body. Usually the stylet is
withdrawn from the cannula after the successful introduction.It is often desirable to place these types of flexible
cannulae in friable vessels of the body having tortuous paths.
A stylet having essentially uniform characteristics over the
entire length of the cannula has typically been used. This
conflicts with the necessity for the person placing the device
to have a relatively stiff guiding stylet to locate the tip of
the catheter near the desired opening or ostium, yet also embody
flexibility to be self-guiding and atraumatic within vessels.
By having two distinctly different types of construction or 
material characteristics along the stylet, each section can be
appropriately tailored to meet these two criteria.Retrograde coronary sinus perfusion cannulae in
particular would benefit from an introducer stylet having a
stiff proximal end and a flexible shape-retaining distal end.
This type of cannula must be introduced through a small hole
formed in the right atrium, and then moved through the interior
of the atrium into coronary sinus ostium. The latter movement
must be essentially blind, with the surgeon having to function
by feel through the back heart wall. It would therefore be
highly desirable to be supplied with an introducer stylet that
may be bent at the distal end into a curve that suits the size
of the heart, and yet possess a relatively stiff proximal end
that may be manipulated to advantage by the surgeon.The present invention
which is defined in claim 1
is directed to an improved
removable cannula introducer in which there is a variable
stiffness embodied in the length of the introducer, from a
relatively stiff

<CLAIMS>
An introducer stylet for medical cannulation comprising:

a handle (20) for manipulation by a user, and
elongated guide means (36, 56 or 80) affixed to and extending from said
handle, said guide means being of shape-retaining construction and of

uniform construction and geometry throughout its length, characterized by
a tube (26 or 26a) that is affixed to and extends from said handle closely surrounding
said guide means for substantial portion less than the entire length of said

guide means for stiffening that portion of said guide means surrounded by said tube
and thereby provide a stylet having a stiff portion adjacent to said handle and a

malleable shape-retaining portion remote from said handle, said guide means being
of malleable costruction.
The stylet set forth in claim 1 wherein said guide means comprises a length
(36, 52 or 80) of malleable wire.
The stylet set forth in claim 2 wherein said guide means further comprises
a tightly coiled spring (50) that surrounds said length of malleable wire.
The stylet set forth in claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said tube (26 or 26a) surrounds
said guide means for substantially 1/3 of the length of said guide means.
A retrograde coronary sinus perfusion cannula (82) that comprises:

an elongated flexible tube (84) with a central perfusion lumen and an integral
side lumen (86) for pressure monitoring,
an inflatable cuff (90) that encircles the distal end of said tube, and
an introducer stylet as set forth in any claim 1-4 removably received in said
central lumen.
