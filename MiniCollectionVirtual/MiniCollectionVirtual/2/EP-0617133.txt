<ABSTRACT>
A syrup consisting of the natural carob sugars and a 
process for its production. The syrup comprises 55-75% 

sucrose, 7-15% fructose, 7-16% glucose, 0.5-3% other 
sugars, 4-14% cyclitoles and 0.5-2 % organic and 

inorganic impurities. The procedure comprises the 
extracting of the sugars from the carob pulp and 

subjecting the juice thus obtained to chromatographic 
separation to separate the sugars from the non-sugars. 
The field of application of the product obtained is 
similar to those of other sugars.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a colourless syrup
which contains all the sugars of the carob, and a process
for obtaining said syrup by forming an aqueous solution
of the soluble components of carob pulp and purifying the
resulting solution by physical/chemical means.The use the carob as a food product for humans has
existed since early times. Nowadays it is still used as
human food in some countries of the Mediterranean basin
from where the fruit originates.The field of application of the product provided by
the present invention corresponds to uses which are
similar to those of other sugars, but with an advantage
in terms of the low cost of the product of the invention
compared with the known sugars and in terms of the re-evaluation 
of the carob by finding for it a noble and
constant application. It is worth remembering that Spain
is the leading carob producing country in the world,
supplying almost 50% of the world's total, and that it is
a Mediterranean dry farming crop.The fact that it is lower in cost than the sugars
obtained from sugar beet, sugar cane and even national
maize is of particular importance these days when, with
the incorporation into the single European market,
Spanish sugar beet and therefore sugar cannot compete
with the more economical and higher quality European
product. The reason for these lower costs are based on:
Lower raw material cost. To produce 1 kg of sugar
about 3 kg of carob pulp are required (14/15 Pesetas/kg),
compared to 8 kg of sugar beet (8/9 Pesetas/kg).Considerably lower investment in installations and
equipment. As it is a non-perishable raw material the
installation can operate throughout the year. As it is
richer in sugar, the volume which has to be processed is
lower during the initial stages.The cost of transformation is no greater.The existence of syrups made from carob obtained in
southern Italy, Portugal and in incipient form in Spain
is known. This product corresponds to the first aqueous
extraction of the carob pulp without purification and
comprises a mixture of all the elements of the carob pulp
which are soluble in water. It is strong and dark in
colour, has an unpleasant odour and tastes of a mixture
of sugars (sweet) and soluble tannins (bitter), i.e. it
still retains the negative characteristics of colour,
odour and taste of the carob itself.Repeated attempts to find processes of purification
by means of applying ion-exchange resins are also known,
but said processes have never become reality because they
are not economic and have serious
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A syrup consisting of the natural carob sugars,
free of the negative characteristics of colour, odour and

taste of natural carob extract, and characterized in that
it has the following composition:


Sucrose
55-75 %
Fructose
7-15 %
Glucose
7-16 %
Other sugars
0.5- 3 %
Cyclitoles
4-14 %
Organic and inorganic impurities
0.5- 2 %

where the percentages are expressed in weight of the dry
matter.
A process for obtaining the syrup of natural
carob sugars according to claim 1, characterized in that

it comprises the following stages:

a) The fruit from the field is subjected to
mechanical operations to separate the foreign elements,

it is washed in water and dried by a current of air;
b) The pods are cut up sufficiently to release the
seed, preferably until they pass through a sieve with a

hole diameter of 12 to 20 mm;
c) The cut up material obtained in the previous
stage is subjected to a separation-sieving operation to

separate on the one hand the seeds and on the other the
pulp, said pulp being subjected to classification,

preferably until it has a granulometry of less than 10
mm.
d) The pulp, cut up to the appropriate granulometry,
is subjected to a continuous extraction process in which

the pulp is put in contact with the diffusion water for
the minimum amount of time necessary, in order to avoid

the proliferation of microorganisms, to obtain on the one
hand a raw juice, with a concentration of between 30 and 

50 °Brix, and on the other a waste pulp
which constitutes the insoluble fraction of the carob

pulp.
e) The waste pulp is pressed in order to extract a
substantial part of the water it carries, said water

still containing in solution sugars and various non-sugars
and being recycled for the extraction of sugars in

the previous stage;
f) The raw juice obtained in the pressing process is
filtered to remove particles of carob in suspension whose

size is ≥ 25 µm;
g) The juices are decalcified by means of cationic
resin charged with Na
+
 ions;
h) The juices are filtered once again this time
through fine filters in order to remove particles whose

size is ≥ 5 µm.
i) The raw juice is evaporated and concentrated from
a concentration of 30 = 50 °Brix as it leaves the

extraction stage to a concentration of approximately 60
°Brix;
j) The sugars and non-sugars of the juice obtained
in the previous stage are separated chromatographically

by passing it through a column of strong cationic resin
based on weakly reticulate polystyrene and whose active

sulphonic groups are charged with a monovalent cation,
preferably sodium or potassium, the column then being

washed with water to obtain a saline fraction which has a
low degree of purity, followed by a fraction which is low

in salts and rich in sugars with a high degree of purity,
an intermediate fraction being recirculated to the

column;
k) The fraction rich in sugars with a high degree of
purity is subjected to additional purification by ionic

exchange in two phases, the first to separate the
dissolved salts and the second to separate the colouring 

elements, to obtain a juice which is essentially pure and
which has a concentration of 20 - 25 Brix, and;
l) The juice obtained in the previous stage is
concentrated to levels of approximately 65 - 70 Brix.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that during the extraction process of stage d), the time

for which the pulp remains in contact with the diffusion
water is 1 to 3 hours, at a temperature of 15 to 30°C and

at a pH of between 4.6 and 5.4.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that during the pressing process of stage e), the pH is

maintained between 5 and 6.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that the process of stage i) is carried out in multiple

effect evaporators at an initial temperature of
approximately 126°C, reducing progressively to 97°C.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that the chromatographic separation of the non-sugars in

stage j) is carried out at temperatures of between 50 and
60°C.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that the process of stage k) is carried out temperatures

below 15°C.
The use of the carob syrup according to claim 1
in applications which are similar to those contemplated

for natural sugars.
The use of the carob fruit for obtaining a syrup
of natural sugars according to the procedure in claims 2

to 7.
