<ABSTRACT>
The memory device according to the invention includes a rigid metallic portion (1) ensuring mechanical and electrical connection with a read system. It includes an EEPROM integrated circuit with reading/writing via the power supply mounted inside a hollow contact connected to the first supply terminal of the IC and acting as protection casing. The whole is mounted on a support (3) fixed in a housing (2) of the metallic portion (1), the latter being connected to the second supply terminal of the IC. It is possible to mount several ICs in the same metallic portion so as to produce a multifunction device.
