<ABSTRACT>
A silicon carbide vertical MOSFET (30, 60) formed on a 
silicon carbide substrate (35, 65) with portions of 

epitaxial layers (39, 48 or 69, 78) defining the various 
transistor electrodes, rather than defining the electrodes 

with implants and diffusion. An opening (40, 70) is formed 
in some of the epitaxial layers and a conductive layer (48, 

85) is formed therein to electrically connect a drain 
contact (95) on the rear of the substrate to the components 

on the front of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to methods of 
fabricating MOSFETs and to the devices and more particularly 
to methods of fabricating silicon carbide vertical MOSFETs 
and to the devices. There is currently a growing demand for power devices 
which offer improved operating efficiency and higher speed. 
Power MOSFETs have inherently higher switching speeds than 
bipolar transistors and thus are strong candidates for use 
in high frequency switch mode power supplies and inverters. 
The fabrication of MOSFETs include many diffusion and wet 
etch steps to form the various electrodes of the device in a 
substrate of silicon or the like, which materials are 
readily susceptible to such process steps. However, silicon and the like have a relatively low 
breakdown voltage and poor thermal conductivity, resulting 
in devices which are rather severely limited in voltage, 
power, and operating temperature characteristics. Some attempts have been made to rectify these 
shortcomings by fabricating lateral MOSFETs from silicon 
carbide, which is capable of withstanding a much larger 
breakdown voltage has a better thermal conductivity and a 
larger bandgap which permits operation at higher 
temperatures. However, lateral MOSFETs have the 
disadvantage of requiring much larger die area for devices 
capable of performing at an equivalent level with vertical 
structures.  It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a 
relatively easy method of fabricating vertical MOSFETs from 
silicon carbide. It is a further purpose of the present invention to 
provide a method of fabricating vertical MOSFETs from 
silicon carbide without requiring difficult diffusion and/or 
implant steps. It is a further purpose of the present invention to 
provide a method of fabricating vertical MOSFETs from 
silicon carbide without requiring difficult wet etch steps. The above described problems are substantially solved 
and the above described purposes are realized in a method of 
fabricating a silicon carbide vertical MOSFET including the 
steps of providing a silicon carbide substrate of a first 
conductivity type and forming a first epitaxial layer of the 
first conductivity type on the surface of the substrate. 
The epitaxial layer is relatively lightly doped compared to 
the substrate. Forming a second epitaxial layer of a second 
conductivity type on the surface of the first epitaxial 
layer. Forming an opening through the second epitaxial 
layer from the surface of the second epitaxial layer so as 
to at least communicate with the
