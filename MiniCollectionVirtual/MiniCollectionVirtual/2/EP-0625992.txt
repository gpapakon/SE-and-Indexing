A process for the production of polycarboxylic acids 
or salts thereof from polysaccharides by oxidation with 

nitrogen dioxide/dinitrogen tetroxide with at least 
partial conversion of the primary alcohol groups of the 

polysaccharides into carboxyl groups and optionally at 
least partial neutralization of the carboxylic acid 

groups formed, the oxidation reaction being carried out 
in a closed reaction system in the presence of oxygen 

under pressures of 2 bar to 10 bar and at a temperature 
of at least 30°C, characterized in that nitrogen dioxide/dinitrogen 

tetroxide is used in such quantities that, 
in the event of a theoretically complete shift of the 

equilibrium onto the nitrogen dioxide side, the nitrogen 
dioxide is present in quantities of at most 2 mole 

equivalents, based on the content of monomer unit of the 
polysaccharide containing one primary alcohol group. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the oxidation reaction is carried out at temperatures 

of 30°C to 70°C and more particularly at temperatures 
of 40°C to 60°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the oxidation reaction is carried out under 

pressures of 2 bar to 6 bar, as measured at the reaction 
temperature. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the pressure in the reaction system is established 

by introduction of gaseous oxygen under pressure either 
once only at the beginning of the reaction or repeatedly, 

if desired continuously, during the reaction. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that oxygen is used in the form of a mixture with at 

least one gas which is inert under the reaction conditions, 
the oxygen making up from 1% by volume to 30% by 

volume and more particularly from 3% by volume to 10% by  
 

volume of the gas mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that helium, argon, carbon dioxide, more particularly 

nitrogen, or a mixture thereof is used as the inert gas. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that the pressure in the reaction system is established 

by introduction of air under pressure. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 4 to 7, 
characterized in that a pressure of less than 10 bar and, 

more particularly, in the range from 2 bar to 6 bar is 
established in the reaction system before the beginning 

of the oxidation reaction by introduction under pressure 
of an inert gas, more particularly nitrogen, helium, 

argon, carbon dioxide or a mixture thereof, and after the 
beginning of the reaction oxygen or a mixture of 1% by 

volume to 30% by volume and, more particularly, 3% by 
volume to 10% by volume of oxygen with one of the inert 

gases mentioned is repeatedly introduced under pressure, 
if desired continuously, so that the oxygen partial 

pressure in the reaction system is in the range from 0.1 
bar to 10 bar and more particularly in the range from 0.5 

bar to 6 bar. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the polysaccharide is used in the 

form of a suspension in a liquid which is substantially 
inert under the reaction conditions. 
A process as claimed in claim 9, characterized in 
that a halogenated hydrocarbon, more particularly carbon 

tetrachloride, is used as the liquid substantially inert 
under the reaction conditions. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the polysaccharide is used in the 

absence of a suspension medium or solvent and optionally 
in the presence of a flow-promoting solid additive. 
A process as claimed in claim 11, characterized in  
 

that the additive is selected from magnesium oxide, 
calcium fluoride, calcium phosphate, pyrogenic silicon 

dioxide and mixtures thereof. 
A process as claimed in claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that the additive is used in quantities of 

0.1% by weight to 5% by weight and more particularly in 
quantities of 0.25% by weight to 1% by weight, based on 

the polysaccharide to be oxidized. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 11 to 13, 

characterized in that the oxidation reaction is carried 
out in a moving bed or in a fluidized bed of the polysaccharide 

to be oxidized using a throughflowing gas containing 
the oxidizing agent. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the polysaccharide is a polyglucosan 

of native origin, more particularly starch and/or 
cellulose. 
A process as claimed in claim 15, characterized in 
that the polysaccharide is a native starch selected from 

potato starch, wheat starch, corn starch, tapioca starch 
and mixtures thereof. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 16,
