<ABSTRACT>
A self-exciting optical strain sensor (20) includes dual parallel bridges (22, 24) having parallel facing surfaces (32, 34). Light energy (38) entering a Fabry-Perot cavity (36) formed by this surfaces (32, 34) induces a periodic buildup and release of energy in the cavity (36) which is directly related to the natural resonant frequency of the bridges (22, 24). Analysis of the intensity of light emitted (50) from the cavity (36) determines the bridge natural frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an optical 
sensor responsive to strain in a substrate. Optical strain gages, and in particular an 
optical strain gage useful in a pressure transducer, 
are known in the art. U.S. Patent, 5, 101,664, 
Optical Pressure Transducer, issued on April 7, 1992 
to Hockaday, et al shows a micromachine silicon 
pressure transducer which employs a single vibrating 
bridge and pressure responsive diaphragm formed from a 
single silicone wafer. The initial wafer is 
micromachined by a combination of etching and laser 
techniques so as to result in a single strand of 
silicon supported at each end by blocks or other 
supports also cut from the initial silicon wafer. By forming the diaphragm, supports, and bridge 
from a single slab of homogeneous material, a pressure 
transducer according to Hockaday, et al is virtually 
unstrained by changes in temperature due to the 
uniformity of the thermal expansivity of the integral 
structure. The degree of strain experienced by the bridge in 
the Hockaday configuration is determined by exciting 
the bridge structure by the use of a beam of light 
which is pulsed in intensity at a frequency equal to 
the nominal natural frequency of the bridge plus any 
strain-induced change in frequency. Optical devices, 
discussed in more detail in the Hockaday patent, 
monitor the vibration frequency of the bridge through 
the use of reflected light analyzed by an 
interferometer, and varies the pulse frequency of the  
 
driving light beam until the resonance frequency of the 
bridge has been determined. The amount of strain in the bridge is a function 
of the modulus of elasticity, geometry, and 
longitudinal stress present in the bridge, which in 
turn may be easily converted to strain at the surface 
of the diaphragm. The prior art device thus provides 
an effective, simple transducer for making temperature 
independent strain measurements, but requiring a 
relatively complicated measuring system able to 
interpret the measured frequency of the bridge and 
vary the driving frequency of the pulsed beam in order 
to seek out the current resonant bridge frequency. The present invention provides a self exciting 
optical strain sensor which is highly resistent to 
thermally induced strain. The self excited optical strain gage of the invention comprises 
first and second bridges, each bridge extending between first and 
second end supports, said bridges and support having been cut from a single, 
uniformly doped silicon wafer; 
said first bridge including a
