<ABSTRACT>
A synchronized digital system transmits clock pulses over a plurality of 
unbalanced transmission lines without causing objectionable electromagnetic 

emissions by inverting the clock pulses on one half of the transmission lines and 
interleaving the transmission lines carrying inverted clock pulses with transmission 

lines carrying non-inverted clock pulses. The interleaving of non-inverted and 
inverted clock pulse transmssion lines allows a significant degree of radiation and 

coupling cancellation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the transmission of clock pulses in a 
synchronized system and in particular to a method and apparatus for reducing 
electromagnetic emissions due to the transmission of clock pulses. The operation of a digital system depends upon the distribution of clock 
pulses to assure the synchronization of the various components and subcircuits of the 
system. Clock pulses have a broad spectral energy density that causes the generation 
of considerable electromagnetic emissions. Other types of digital signals such as 
data signals also generate electromagnetic emissions, however the clock pulses 
generate the strongest emission components. Traditionally the clock pulse generated emissions have been suppressed 
by use of balanced digital signal transmission lines for transmission of clock pulses. 
These balanced digital signal transmission lines advantageously maximize common 
mode noise immunity and minimize common mode radiation. Unfortunately the use 
of balanced transmission lines adds significant cost and complexity to the system. 
This added complexity is a result of the need for special device drivers, connector 
pins and the use of special expensive transmission cables. Hence systems requiring 
a large number of clock pulse transmission lines must forgo this arrangement and 
use radiation rich unbalanced line interconnections in the interest of economy. A synchronized digital system as defined in claim 1 transmits clock 
pulses over a plurality of unbalanced transmission lines without causing 
objectionable electromagnetic emissions. In the Drawing: 
FIG. 1 is a schematic of a digital system having a clock pulse 
transmission arrangement embodying the principles of the invention; FIG. 2 is a schematic of the application of the synchronizing pulse 
system of the invention applied to an array of circuit packs or boards arranged in a 
cabinet or other enclosure; and FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating radiation emission reduction as a function 
of time skew between inverted and non-inverted clock pulses on adjacent clock 
transmission lines. The clock pulse transmission scheme disclosed in FIG. 1 includes a 
system clock 101 for generating a series of clock pulses which are supplied over 
unbalanced transmission lines to various portions of a digital system to guarantee 
overall system synchronicity. The output of the system clock 101 is applied via a 
lead 102 to a first clock pulse transmission line 103. The clock pulses on the 
transmission line 103 are applied to the bus interface
