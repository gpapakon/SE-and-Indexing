<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a non-linear optically active (NLO) side 
chain polycarbonate and to NLO active waveguides containing said 

polycarbonate. Waveguides containing this NLO polycarbonate have a low 
loss of signal. Polycarbonates based on bischloroformates of 

hexafluorobisphenol A , hexafluorotetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol 
S or deuterated bisphenol A or sulphonylbiphenol are especially 

preferred within the framework of the invention: they were found to 
give an exceptionally low loss of signal. The invention further 

pertains to cross-linkable and already cross-linked polycarbonates. 
Especially preferred polycarbonates according to the invention are 

those where the diol comprises a rigid donor group. These 
polycarbonates have a high Tg, which renders them thermally stable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a non-linear optically active (NLO) side 
chain condensation polymer. For a description of such a polymer 
reference may be had to EP-A1-0 350 112. In said document 
polyurethanes are described which have been produced by the 
condensation polymerisation of diols having pendant NLO groups and 
diisocyanates. Generally, NLO groups are composed of a delocalised π 
system connected on one side to an electron donating group, i.e. a 
donor group, and on the other to an electron withdrawing group, i.e. 
an acceptor group. The term Donor-π-Acceptor (DπA) group is also used. When polymeric non-linear optically active material, i.e. polymeric 
material containing DπA groups, is poled, non-linear polarisation 
occurs under the influence of an external field of force (such as an 
electric field of force). Non-linear electric polarisation may give 
rise to a number of optically non-linear phenomena, including 
frequency doubling and Pockels effect. By utilising these phenomena it 
is possible to employ this material in the form of a poled film in 
optically active waveguiding components such as optical switches, 
frequency doublers, etc., in short, in active optical waveguides. For all that they display a high degree of NLO behaviour, the above-mentioned 
polymers are not optimally suited to be used in active 
optical waveguide components. The main drawback to the above-described and other known active 
polymeric waveguides is their loss of signal. In the wavelength area 
for optical uses (1300-1600 nm) the known polymeric waveguides suffer 
major losses of signal. Another drawback to the above-described and other known active 
polymeric waveguides is the fact that the polability still leaves much 
to be desired. Frequently, during poling only part of the DπA groups  
 
is alligned which results in a low initial Pockels coefficent (r₃₃ and 
r₁₃, which will be elucidated later). The invention envisages providing an NLO condensation polymer with low 
loss of signal and good polability. The invention is characterised in that the NLO condensation polymer is 
a polycarbonate obtained from a monomer mixture comprising: 
an NLO diol satisfying formula 1: 
 
   wherein D is a trivalent donor group comprising 2-10 aliphatic, 
alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carbon atoms, and comprising 
at least one alkoxy-oxygen atom, at least one sulphur atom, at 
least one selenium atom, or a nitrogen atom directly or 
conjugatedly bonded to the benzene ring, and
 
   wherein 
Xstands for -CR²=CR², -N=N-,
