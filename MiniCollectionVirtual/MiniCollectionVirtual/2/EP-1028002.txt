<ABSTRACT>
A kit for making an original holder is disclosed. In the kit. a holder 10 of A4 size with
a paper fastener 7 is divided into two and provided as two members 11 and 12. The member 11.

consisting of a front panel 1 isolated from other portions of the holder cover, is a substantially flat
paper sheet and generally rectangular in standardized lengthwise A4 size which is adapted to be

passed through common personal printers easily. The member 12 consists of the rest of the holder
cover and a paper fastener 7. The rest of the cover is made with a single paper sheet in which a

back panel 2, a spine panel 3, a pleat 4 and a joint portion 5 are defined by folding the sheet, and
the paper fastener 7 is secured on the pleat 4. A double-coated adhesive tape 6 is adhesively

bonded on the outside surface of the joint portion 5 along a line a-a. Upon making the holder 10
with this kit, the member 11 is fed through a printer and any desired designs are printed thereon.

Then, the members 11 and 12 are overlapped with the lines a-a and a'-a' matched up and secured
together with the adhesive tape 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to holders for flat objects such as
papers and/or computer disks. More particularly, this invention
is directed to kits for easily making original holders by
directly printing on covers with common personal printers, such
as laser or ink jet printers.Various types of holders for holding flat objects have
previously been proposed. To have a better understanding of the
invention, some typical constructions of conventional holders
will first be described.One of the principal types of such holders is generally
known as a "Flat-type holder". One example thereof is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No.93-82583,
which is incorporated herein by reference. A holder 100 of this
type, as shown in FIG.16, comprises a cover 101 and a fastener
102. The cover 101 is made with a single paper sheet, and
consists essentially of a front panel 1, a back panel 2, a
spine panel 3 and a pleat 4 defined by folding the sheet on its 
folding lines b-b, c-c, d-d and e-e as shown in FIG.16. A
folding line a-a is a guiding line to open the front panel. The
fastener 102 is secured on the pleat 4.In this construction, however, since the entire cover 101
is made with a single sheet, the sheet itself inevitably
becomes bigger. This structure causes difficulties in direct
printing on the holder cover by small and low-cost popular
personal printers, such as laser and ink jet printers, without
encountering limited feed size problems, jamming problems, or
distorted printing problems.Another type of such holders is generally known as a
"pocket-type holder". A holder 200 of this type as shown in
FIG.17, comprises a cover 201 and a pocket 202. The cover 201
is made with a single paper sheet too, and consists essentially
of a front panel 1 and a back panel 2 defined by folding the
sheet on its folding line g-g located in the middle of the
sheet. Typically, the pocket 202 is formed on the inside
surface of the back panel 2 with pocket flaps 203 and 204.In this construction, however, since the entire cover 201
is made with a single sheet (usually the pocket flaps 203 and
204 are also included), the sheet itself inevitably becomes
bigger. This construction makes it difficult for end-users to
print directly on the cover by common personal printers because
of size, shapes and other considerations. Furthermore, these 
holders are normally provided with their pocket flaps 203 and
204 having been firmly fixed on the back panel to form the
pocket 202, which makes it almost impossible to feed the sheet
through the
