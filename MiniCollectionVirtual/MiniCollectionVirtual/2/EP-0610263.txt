<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a hinge arrangement 
as defined in the preamble to Claim 1. In prior art are known hinge arrangements for 
pivotally mounting a sliding element, which can be 
moved in guidance and support by a stationary pair of 
guide sections, to be turnable about a hinge axle 
attached to the sliding element. A typical sliding element 
system comprises a plurality of rectangular sliding 
elements, each element presenting a first side and 
a second side, substantially parallelling each other. 
Guide wheel sets are attached on the first side and on 
the second side of the sliding element. The system further 
comprises a pair of guide sections, mounted to be 
stationary and comprising a first guide section disposed 
adjacent to the first side of the sliding element, 
and a second guide section disposed adjacent to 
the second side of the sliding element, the guide wheel 
sets running in guidance of these guide sections. The 
sliding elements are carried by the guide sections one 
after the other and they can be moved as desired in 
guidance of said guides. Since the movable sliding elements have no 
actual fixed hinge location, as is the case with common 
windows for instance, hinging them has caused problems 
in regard of adequately supporting the glass and in 
view of easy and convenient use. In prior art are known, e.g. in connection 
with balcony glass pane systems, guides curving out 
from the guide section proper and guiding and carrying 
the sliding glass element, with the aid of which the 
element can be turned into its open position in which 
the sliding element is positioned at an angle against 
the principal transporting direction taking place along 
the guide sections. Installation of separate curved guides imposes  
 
limitations on the installation of the sliding element 
such as balcony glass panes, because the curved guide 
is that part of the system which carries the glass. 
Therefore, the curved guide must invariably be supported 
at a point which can take up the weight of the glasses. 
On balconies where the glassing does not extend to 
the balcony slab above, or on balconies altogether 
lacking a roof, installation of the system under consideration 
is difficult or outright impossible. Moving 
and opening the panes along the curved guide is awkward 
and implies quite careful moving of the glass pane 
along the curve. Even then, panes of great height will 
not always find enough support, and they must therefore 
be steadied with the hand when they are being opened.

<CLAIMS>
A hinge arrangement for hinging a sliding 
element (2) movable in guidance of, and carried by, a 

pair of stationary guide sections (11,12) for turning 
about a hinge axle (3) affixed to said sliding element, 

the hinge arrangement comprising: 

a first coupling member (4) comprising a 
slide member (7) consisting of a chisel-shaped portion 

formed on the hinge axle (3), and 
a second coupling member (5) disposed on a 
coupling piece (6) affixed to the guide section (1
1
, 
12), the second coupling member consisting of a round 

recess (11) arranged to receive the chisel-shaped portion 
of the slide member (7), the coupling piece (6) 

further comprising a guide (8) for guiding the chisel-shaped 
portion of the slide member (7) into coupling 

engagement with the round recess (11) of second coupling 
member (5), 
 
   whereby the first coupling member and the second 

coupling member are arranged to become coupled 
with each other when the first coupling member is in 

register with the second coupling member, and thus to 
lock the hinge axle (3) relative to the guide section 

to be substantially immovable, for the turning of said 
sliding element, characterized in that the coupling 

piece (6) comprises in consecutive succession two or 
more second coupling members (5), the guide (8) being 

a straight elongated slot which extends through the 
whole coupling piece (6) and through each of the successive 

coupling members (5) so that the chisel-shaped 
portion of the slide member (7) may pass through the 

guiding slot (8) for enabling the sliding element to 
be conveyed past the hinging points. 
Hinge arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the second coupling member (5) 

comprises a round turning sleeve (9) presenting a diametral  
 

slot (10) passing through it and disposed to 
receive in itself the slide member (7); and that the 

turning sleeve (8) is disposed to be turnable in the 
recess (11). 
Hinge arrangement according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the slide member (7) is formed 

at the end of the hinge axle (3).
