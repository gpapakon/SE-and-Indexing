<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a multilayer printed circuit upon a single crystal 
substrate (10) for the mounting thereon of a semiconductor laser 

(17) and an optical fibre pigtail (18) located in a crystallographically 
etched groove (23) in the substrate wherein all the 

photolithographic processing required to create the multilayer 

printed circuit is performed prior to the etching of the groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of optical coupling with an
electro-optic transducer mounted on a single crystal substrate
where at least part of that coupling is provided by an optical
component located in a crystallographically etched groove or pit
formed in the single crystal substrate. For the purpose of this
specification the term crystallographic etching is defined to mean
the type of etching in which a pit or groove is etched in a single
crystal substrate and the depth of that pit or groove is determined
by its width and by the fact that the etchant is employed under
conditions in which it preferentially etches to specific crystal planes.
Typically the optical component may be a ball lens mounted in an
etch pit, or a graded index lens or the end of an optical fibre,
mounted in an etched groove. A further example of an optical
component that may be located in this way is an optical isolator.
One of the advantages of this form of location of an optical
component is the dimensional stability it is likely to afford in relation
to the electro-optic transducer, and another is the precision of
positioning it can afford. Precision of positioning of the electro-optic
transducer in relation to the substrate can be provided by the use of
printed circuit technology. For the purposes of this specification the
term 'printed circuit' means a structure bearing on electrically
insulating material one or more electrical conductors created by a
graphic art process, and the term 'multilayer printed circuit' means a
structure bearing graphic art created electrical conductors arranged
in a plurality of discrete layers separated at least in part by
electrically insulating material.An instance of the mounting of an optical fibre in a
crystallographically etched Vee-groove in optical coupling
relationship with an electro-optic transducer is described in 
GB 2 255 672A, to which attention is directed. In GB 2 255 672 A
there is described a method of making such an arrangement in
which a photolithography process is used to define, and then
anisotropically etch, a Vee-groove in a single crystal substrate.
After the etching of the Vee-groove, further processing is employed
to form a patterned electrically conductive ground plane covered
with a dielectric layer of SiO2, still further processing is then
employed to provide vias in the dielectric layer, and to cover it with
an electrically conductive layer that is patterned to provide a
number of interconnects. On one of these interconnects is
mounted an electro-optic

A method of making a multilayer printed circuit on a single
crystal substrate (10) for the inserting thereon of at least one

electro-optic transducer (17) and at least one optical component
(18), which multilayer printed circuit comprises a plurality of

electrical conductors arranged in a plurality of discrete layers
separated at least in part by electrically insulating material, which

method includes employing photolithographic processing to
produce the configuration of all the electrical conductors of the

printed circuit, and the step of crystallographically etching at least
one pit or groove (23) in the single crystal substrate for the location

therein of an optical component, the depth of which pit or groove
has been photolithographically defined, characterised in that said

photolithographic processing to produce the configuration of all of

said step of crystallographically etching at least one pit or groove in
the single crystal substrate.
A method of making a multilayer printed circuit upon a single
crystal substrate, which method is as claimed in claim 1, and

includes the step of providing upon the substrate (10) a solder-wettable
pad (16a), and the step of securing said transducer (17) to

the pad by solder bump soldering.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein solder (22) for said
soldering is applied to the pad as a composite gold/tin solder layer

deposited thereon by the deposition of layers of gold and tin,
wherein the tin is ion-bombarded during is deposition.
