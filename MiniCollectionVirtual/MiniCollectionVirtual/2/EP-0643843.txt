 AUTOMATIC HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SCANNING RADARBACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION This invention relates to a radar system for use especially with aircraft, and capable of automatic horizontal and vertical scanning and display of radar signals for presentation of a selectable vertical range for both a plan view and vertical view, and with the plan view display being with reference to latitude and longitude, if desired. Conventional airborne weather radar systems display radar returns in a plan view only, representing weather images as the radar beam sweeps horizontally back and forth ahead of the aircraft, although a proposal for automatically displaying radar returns in both plan view and vertical view has been disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,940,987. With the system of the patent, more information is available to the user since height, as well as horizontal extent, of weather conditions can be determined whereas, with the conventional systems, only the horizontal extent can be ascertained (at least automatically) . Of course, knowing the height of a weather condition would enable the user of the system to determine whether flying above the condition were possible or whether flying around the system would be necessary. 

 Prior to the system of the afore-cited patent, determination of height of weather conditions had to be made by manually tilting the radar antenna up or down so that radar returns could be taken along sweeps at different elevations. Then, knowing the angle of elevation of the radar beam, the altitude of the aircraft, and the distance of certain echo returns, a trigonometric calculation or estimate could be made as to the height or elevation of weather conditions from which the echoes were reflected. Such manual tilting and elevation calculation, however, were time consuming, and a flight crew typically would not have the time to perform such operations, especially when flying in a stormy weather condition. Of course, with the system of the patent, such manual tilting and calculation is obviated.Oftentimes during flight, the pilot will have no need for display of weather or other echo causing conditions much below the altitude of the aircraft, and yet such conditions may nevertheless be displayed on conventional weather radar systems (unless the pilot manually sets the radar antenna above a certain level) . It would be desirable to eliminate such distracting echoes, such as ground clutter (echoes from terrain) which are sometimes not easy to distinguish from storms particularly in
