<ABSTRACT>
In an injection pump, pump pistons (PK) are provided, which run on a filling slope (FÜ) and a delivery slope (FÖ) of a cam path, the start of delivery being predetermined by closure of a solenoid valve (MV). The actual operating condition is determined by the provision of a structure-borne noise transmitter (PZ). Usable in injection pumps of internal combustion engines.

<CLAIMS>
Device for determining at least one actual 
operating condition of a valve-controlled injection pump 

for internal combustion engines, in particular diesel 
internal combustion engines, pump pisto
ns being provided 
which run on a filling ramp and on a delivery ramp of a 

cam ring, a cam plate or a camshaft, the start of 
delivery being dependent upon the closing instant of a 

solenoid valve, characterized in that the actual start of 
delivery (SOP) is determined by a structure-borne-noise 

transducer (PZ) when a pump piston (PK) strikes the 
delivery ramp (FÖ). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the structure-borne-noise transducer (PZ) is a 

piezoelectric transducer. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the structure-borne-noise transducer (PZ) is 

arranged in the region of the cam ring (NR). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the structure-borne-noise transducer is arranged in 

the region of the tacho-generator of the pump. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the structure-borne-noise transducer is arranged in 

an electronic system, arranged on the pump, in such a way 
that it contacts a part of the pump housing. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the information from the structure-borne-noise 

transducer is analyzed in a pump control unit (PCU).
