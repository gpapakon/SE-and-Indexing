<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for measuring the condition of a receiver antenna (26) at a base station of a TDMA radio system. The method comprises: a) transmission (28A) of a radio frequency measuring signal through an antenna line (27) towards the antenna; b) measurement (20) of the strength of a measuring signal component reflected back and passed along a predetermined measuring path; c) transmission (28B) of the measuring signal directly towards the receiver (210) to said measuring path; d) measurement (20) of the strength of the measuring signal transmitted directly along the measuring path. In the invention, the measurement is performed in a time slot allocated for a radio test loop, due to which it is possible to utilize frequencies actually used for traffic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for measuring
the condition of a receiver antenna at a base station
of a TDMA radio system, the method comprising a)
transmission of a radio frequency measuring signal
tnrough an antenna line towards the antenna, b) measurement
of the strength of a measuring signal component
reflected back and passed along a predetermined
measuring path, c) transmission of the measuring
signal directly towards the receiver to said measuring
path, d) measurement of the strength of the measuring
signal transmitted directly along the measuring
path.A substantial part of radio systems, for instance
cellular radio telephone systems and base stations
thereof, are receiver and transmitter antennas,
the condition of which influences the quality of connections.
The condition of the antennas can be controlled
e.g. by measuring the standing wave ratio of
the antennas, i.e. electrical matching of the antennas
to the rest of the receiver and transmitter system.By means of present methods, the measurement is
performed by supplying power through the antenna line
to the receiver antenna and by measuring the power
reflected back from the antenna along the antenna
line by means of a broadband power meter. Due to the
broadband power meter, the power used for the measurement
must be high in order that the measurement
will not be sensitive to interference, which means
that signals received by the antenna do not disturb
the measurement. Using high power causes intermodulation
distortion in the receiver. These problems can 
be avoided by using a duplex filter separating from
each other the measuring signal and the signals intended
to be received. However, the duplex filter
shall be installed before the receiver parts, which
weakens the sensitivity of the receiver, because the
filter causes losses in the antenna signal.A further solution is known, avoiding both
above-mentioned problems by using a measuring frequency
outside the receiver band and a narrow-band
power measurement adapted to this frequency.European Patent Application 0 261 828 discloses
an analyzer of microwave range, measuring a signal
supplied directly from a measuring source as well as
a signal reflected from the microwave network to be
analyzed, for a vector-based relative power measurement.
At measurement of reflected power, a sample
signal taken of the output power of a measuring generator
is brought to a detector along a path different
from the path of a sample signal taken of the
power reflected from the microwave network to be analyzed.
