<ABSTRACT>
A test apparatus for leak-testing waterproof footwear comprises a support post (40) and an inflatable collar (2, 43) slideably mounted thereon. A foot (48) is attached to the lower end of the post for abutting the inside sole of the footwear and spacing the collar the correct distance therefrom to seal the entrance to the footwear. The collar is inflated to seal the interior of the footwear, which is then pressurised with air. Any air leaks are detected by immersion in water and observation of bubbles, or by using a sonic probe. Almost complete footwear items can be tested, usually before application of the outer sole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a test apparatus for 
leak-testing waterproof footwear, in particular footwear 
which includes a waterproof water vapour permeable 
breathable material such as GORE-TEX or similar material. Waterproof footwear including a waterproof (i.e. 
impermeable to liquid water) water vapour permeable 
membrane, such as that available under the GORE-TEX 
trademark, has been on the market for some time. 
This has been produced by first of all forming a "bootee" 
of a laminate of the membrane material, which can then be 
leak tested by immersion in water. However, it has more 
recently been proposed to integrate the waterproof 
membrane into the construction process of the shoe. In 
this latter case, it becomes necessary to carry out the 
leak testing on an assembled or partially assembled shoe, 
rather than a flexible bootee. There is in any case a 
benefit in being able to leak-test the shoe in its 
semi-finished state prior to application of the sole. At 
this stage any leaks can still be corrected. Any test 
apparatus must, of course, be capable of giving rapid test 
results in a production line environment. US patent specification 4,799,384 discloses a bootee  
 
testing machine wherein the entrance to the bootee is 
sealed by clamping together the flexible sides of the 
ankle portion of the bootee. This is only applicable to 
flexible booties and cannot be used to leak-test assembled 
or partially assembled shoes. US patent 4,918,981 discloses an apparatus for 
measuring the moisture vapour transmission rate through 
the sides of a shoe, which involves inserting a waterproof 
water-vapour-permeable liner inside the shoe, filling the 
liner with water and measuring the amount of water lost in 
a given time by transmission through the walls of the 
liner and the shoe. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an apparatus for leak testing waterproof footwear, which 
may be used on assembled or partially assembled items of 
footwear. The present invention provides a test apparatus for 
leak-testing waterproof footwear, which comprises: 
support means for passing through an entrance of the 
footwear; collar means disposed around the support means in the 
ankle region of the footwear for sealably closing the 
entrance to the footwear; and means for introducing a super-atmospheric pressure of 
gas into the interior of the sealed footwear item. The invention also provides a corresponding method of 
leak-testing. Preferably, the support means includes a foot which 
bears

<CLAIMS>
A test apparatus for leak-testing waterproof 
footwear, which comprises: 


support means (40) for passing through an entrance of 
the footwear; 
collar means (10) disposed around the support means 
in the ankle region of the footwear for sealably 

closing an entrance to the footwear; and 
means (8) for introducing a super-atmospheric 
pressure of gas into the interior of the sealed 

footwear item. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the support 
means further comprises a foot (48) at a lower end 

thereof, for abutting the inside sole of the footwear in 
use such as to space the collar means a predetermined 

distance above the sole. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the support 
means further comprises adjustment means (2, 44) 

operatively interposed between the collar means and the 
foot for varying said predetermined spacing distance. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the support 
means is in the form of an elongate member and the collar 

means is movable therealong; the adjustment means 
comprising a replaceable spacer (44) around the elongate  

 
support means between the foot and the collar means, and 

screw means (40, 42) for holding the collar means against 
the spacer. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein 
the collar means comprises an inflatable ring (10) 

disposed around the support means, and a duct (6) 
connected thereto for enabling inflation of the ring into 

sealing contact with said footwear entrance. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the foot is 
provided with protrusions (50) to raise the foot above the 

sole of the footwear, and said means (8) for introducing 
gas passes through the support means and exits therefrom 

at a location on the underside of the foot. 
A method of leak-testing waterproof footwear which 
comprises; 


introducing a collar means into an entrance to the 
footwear so as to seal closed the entrance; 
introducing a super-atmospheric pressure of gas 
into the interior of the sealed footwear; and 
locating any leakage of gas from the footwear which 
is indicative of a leak in the footwear. 
A method according to claim 7 wherein the collar 
means is inflated into sealing contact with the footwear 

entrance.
