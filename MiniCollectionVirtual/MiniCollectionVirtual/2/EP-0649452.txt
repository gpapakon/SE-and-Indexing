<DESCRIPTION>
This invention belongs to the field of powder coatings. 
More particularly, this invention relates to a 
powder coating composition comprised of a blend of an 
acrylic copolymer and a semicrystalline polyester, e.g., 
poly(tetramethylene trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate). Plastic materials used in the manufacture of powder 
coatings are classified broadly as either thermosetting 
or thermoplastic. In the application of thermoplastic 
powder coatings, heat is applied to the coating on the 
substrate to melt the particles of the powder coating 
and thereby permit the particles to flow together and 
form a smooth coating. Thermosetting coatings, when compared to coatings 
derived from thermoplastic compositions, generally are 
tougher, more resistant to solvents and detergents, have 
better adhesion to metal substrates and do not soften 
when exposed to elevated temperatures. However, the 
curing of thermosetting coatings has created problems in 
obtaining coatings which have, in addition to the above-stated 
desirable characteristics, good smoothness and 
flexibility. Coatings prepared from thermosetting 
powder compositions, upon the application of heat, may 
cure or set prior to forming a smooth coating, resulting 
in a relatively rough finish referred to as an "orange 
peel" surface. Such a coating surface or finish lacks 
the gloss and luster of coatings typically obtained from 
thermoplastic compositions. The "orange peel" surface 
problem has caused thermosetting coatings to be applied 
from organic solvent systems which are inherently 
undesirable because of the environmental and safety 
problems that may be occasioned by the evaporation of 
the solvent system. Solvent-based coating compositions 
also suffer from the disadvantage of relatively poor  
 
percent utilization, i.e., in some modes of application, 
only 60 percent or less of the solvent-based coating 
composition being applied contacts the article or 
substrate being coated. Thus, a substantial portion of 
solvent-based coatings can be wasted since that portion 
which does not contact the article or substrate being 
coated obviously cannot be reclaimed. In addition to exhibiting good gloss, impact 
strength and resistance to solvents and chemicals, 
coatings derived from thermosetting coating compositions 
must possess good to excellent flexibility. For 
example, good flexibility is essential for powder 
coating compositions used to coat sheet (coil) steel 
which is destined to be formed or shaped into articles 
used in the manufacture
