<ABSTRACT>
An inductive electrical transformer has a magnetic core (1) to which a primary winding (2) and a secondary winding (3) are assigned. In order to achieve a small physical form and simplified insulation conditions, the core (1) consists, at least in the region of the primary winding (2) or in the region between the primary winding and the secondary winding (2, 3), of a magnetically permeable material having a high electrical resistance.

Inductive electrical voltage transformer for medium voltage, comprising a primary
coil (2) designed in the manner of a sandwich coil with a voltage potential

decreasing in stages during operation over the axial length of the coil from the
primary coil end connected to high voltage to the primary coil end connected to

earth potential, a secondary coil (3) situated in the axial extension of the high-voltage-conducting
primary coil (2) and galvanically separated from the primary coil

(2) and a soft magnetic core (1) which couples the primary coil (2) magnetically to
the secondary coil (3), the primary coil (2) to be connected to earth potential at the

end adjacent to the secondary coil (3), characterised in that the core (1) consists of
two core parts with an E-shaped cross section abutting one another via their open

sides and consists in its entirety of a permeable material with high electrical
resistance, that the central legs (1.13) of the core parts are immersed centrally into

the primary and secondary coils (2, 3) and the outer legs (1.11; 1.12) enclose these

coils (2, 3) over part of their circumference, and that the core (1) and the coils (2,
3) are coated at least in the surface region and on the core part at the high-voltage

side with free-flowing, curing insulating material (9).
Voltage transformer according to claim 1, characterised in that the core (1) is filled
in the region of the coils (2, 3) with free-flowing, curing insulating material.
