<ABSTRACT>
A dual voltage servo system and method for 
detecting which of a plurality of supply voltages is 

available to a peripheral device such as a disk drive, 
selecting from memory a set of characteristics designed 

to optimize operation of the disk drive at that supply 
voltage, and operating the disk drive or other 

peripheral in accordance with those characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disk drives generally,
and particularly relates to servo systems for
removable disk drives.Notebook computers have become commonplace both
in the workplace and in the home. However, one
difficulty which continues to exist is how to transfer
data from a notebook system to a desktop system.Many users of notebook computers rely on floppy
diskettes to transfer their data. However, floppies
suffer from a number of limitations including low
capacity, low speed and relatively poor reliability.
Cable based file transfers are also commonplace, but
require the presence of both machines, as well as
knowing precisely which files are to be transferred.Removable disk drives installable in both the
portable and the desktop machine offer perhaps the
most effective method of transferring data, because it
allows users to compactly transport all of their
programs and data in exactly the proper arrangement.
In this manner no files are forgotten, no directories
or partitions have to be relearned, and capacity is
comparatively huge.One problem with removable disk drives is that
portable computers typically provide only a five volt
supply, which tends to limit the performance of the
disk drive when installed in a portable. Desktop
machines, on the other hand, provide both five and
twelve volt supplies, and users of desktop machines
quickly become accustomed to the higher disk
performance available with a twelve volt supply. 
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the voice
coil motor used to position the heads over the disk in
most modern disk drives offers significantly better
performance when driven with a twelve volt supply than
with a five volt supply.As a result, while it is necessary in the current
state of the art for a disk drive to function on five
volts in the environment of a portable computer, it is
highly desirable for the disk drive to function on
twelve volts in the environment of a desktop computer.Although not directed to this problem,
US-5,204,593 discloses a drive system including a
spindle motor, a voice coil motor, and a power supply
monitoring device for monitoring a power supply
voltage. The voltages supplied to the motors are
controlled based upon the monitored power supply
voltage. This allows the drive system to be operable
by a power supply having a voltage range of between
three and five volts, and reduces the electric power
consumed by the drive system.In a first aspect, the present invention provides
a hard disk drive data storage system for use with a
host

system (10) comprising:-

at least one rotatable disk (80) upon which data
can be stored;
a spindle motor (40) coupled to said disk to
impart rotation thereto;
an actuator (50) including a motor (60) coupled
