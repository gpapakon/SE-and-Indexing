<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for fastening and adjusting the front panel 
(12) of a drawer with respect to the side panel (11) 

comprises a sliding element (26) which is made to slide by 
shifting means (19, 21) in the direction of the length of 

the side panel. The sliding element (26) comprises a 
hook-shaped end (28) which engages with complementary 

hooking means (32) fitted on the front panel, so as to 
support the front panel and draw the hooking means close 

to the device upon operation of the shifting means (19, 
21), thereby blocking the movement of the front panel with 

respect to the side panels of the drawer. The sliding 
element (26) can be raised by means of an adjusting screw 

(30) to provide adjustment of the vertical position of the 
front panel. The shifting means and the adjusting screws 

are provided with respective control ends protruding from 
the lower side of the device and extending along a lower 

edge of the side panel containing the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an innovative device for
fastening and adjusting the front panels of drawers.
There are known drawers in which the front panel is fitted
so as to be adjustable in position, in order to permit its
precise alignment with the other front elements adjacent
to it. In these drawers the adjusting system is usually
housed on the lateral surface of the side panels close to
the front panel and access to the screws which enable it
to be operated is also lateral. Such a device is disclosed in DE-U- 9204234. This gives rise to
aesthetical problems, since the mechanism and the screws
are visible when the drawer is open, as well as functional
problems, and makes it difficult for example to adjust the
front panels whenever there are objects protruding from
the side of the drawer.In order to prevent the screws from showing when the
drawer is open, cover plates are normally used purely for
aesthetical purposes, which, however, more often than not
are merely palliatives.The general object of this invention is to obviate the
aforementioned problems, by providing a device for fitting
and adjusting the front panel of a drawer which makes the
front panel easier to fit, the adjustments simpler to
carry out and the overall appearance more attractive.
This object is achieved according to the invention by
providing a device for fitting and adjusting the front 
panel of a drawer with respect to the side panel,
as defined in claim 1.The innovatory principles of this invention and its
advantages compared to the known technique will be more
clearly evident from the following description of a
possible exemplificative and non-restrictive embodiment
applying such principles, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
figure 1 shows a partial cutaway, side, scrap view of a
drawer applying the innovative front panel securing and
adjusting device claimed herein;figure 2 shows a cross sectional view along the line
II-II of figure 1; figure 3 shows a front view of the device of figure 1.
With reference to the figures, figure 1 shows a portion of
a side panel 11 of a drawer onto which is fitted a front
panel 12 by means of an innovative securing device
indicated generically by reference 10. The side panel can
comprise known sliding means for the drawer which are not
shown.As can be clearly seen in figures 2 and 3, the device 10
is housed inside a recess 13 made in the side panel which
opens out at the end of the side panel on which the front
panel rests. The side panel can advantageously be made in
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device (10) for fitting and adjusting the front panel
(12) of a drawer with respect to the side panel (11),

the device comprising a
sliding element (26) sliding in a first direction and controlled by shifting means (19,

21), the device being intended to be fitted on the side of
the drawer so as to have said sliding element (26)

disposed with said first sliding direction parallel to the length
of the side panel (11), the sliding element (26)

comprising a hook-shaped end (28) which engages with
complementary coupling means (33) designed to be fitted on

the front panel to support the front panel and bring the
coupling means close to the device upon operation of the

shifting means (19, 21), the sliding element (26) being movable also in a second direction, which is substantially normal to the first direction and having a
hook-shaped end (28) which can be lifted in said second direction

to adjust the vertical position of
the front panel, characterized by the fact that the sliding element

is movable in the second direction by means of an
adjusting screw (30), the shifting means and the adjusting

screw having rotation axes for moving the hook-shaped end (28)
in the first and second directions which are directed parallel to the

second direction in order that respective control ends of the shifting means and adjusting screw protrude from
one side of the device which is intended to extend along a lower edge

of the side panel when the device is fitted on the drawers.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the coupling means comprise a housing (32) to receive

the hook-shaped end (28) of the sliding element, said
housing (32) being of a greater width crosswise to the

coupling element than the crosswise width of the coupling
element itself to allow their reciprocal horizontal

movement in order to enable the horizontal adjustment of 
the position of the front panel with respect to the side

panel.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the shifting means comprise a

pivot (19) axially rotatable around said rotation axis and having a lower end on said one side of the device which forms a control
end (20) of the pivot (19) and an eccentric section (25) close to the other

end which is housed in a housing (35) in the sliding
element, upon axial rotation of the pivot the eccentric

section shifting the sliding element in said first sliding
direction.
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the fact
that the pivot has a control end integral with a radial

rotating lever (21).
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the fact
that the lever
 (21) is in a position which covers the
control end of the adjusting screw when the sliding

element is in the position in which it draws the coupling
means close together.
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the fact
that the sliding element (26) is made from shaped sheet

metal, the hook-shaped end (28) being disposed in a
plane which is parallel to said movement plane while the opposite end is rotated at

right angles to lie in a plane which is normal to said rotation axes, said opposite
end being perforated to form the housing (35) for the

eccentric section of the pivot.
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the fact
that said opposite end of the sliding element is housed

with clearance in a direction which is parallel to said rotation axes in a 
groove (27) in the device the groove being substantially transverse to said rotation axes and traversed by the pivot

(19), in order to allow the adjusting screw (30) to move
the hook-shaped end (28) in the second direction by slanting the sliding element.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact
that the coupling means comprise an element (33) designed

to be protrudingly secured to the front panel (12) and
centrally provided with a hook shape complementary to that

of the hook-shaped end of the sliding element.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact
of having an elongated shape in said movement plane so as to fit into a housing

provided in the thickness of the side panel.
Device as claimed in claim 9, characterized by the
fact of comprising in said one side a screw (18) for fastening

it in said housing in the side panel.
Device as claimed in claim 3, characterized by the
fact that the pivot (19) comprises in a position half way

between its two ends a circumferential groove (23)
inserted in correspondence with which is pin (24)

preventing the axial sliding of the pivot (19) while
enabling its free axial rotation.
