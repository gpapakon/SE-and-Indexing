<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a distal end and a proximal end provided 

with a connecting means, at least one continuous channel and 
with a flexible part at the distal end.

 
In the flexible end-section a pull wire, extending through 

the channel to the outside of the proximal end, is attached 
eccentrically.

 
The deflection of the end-section can be varied with the aid 

of a sliding wire advanced further or less far in a second 
channel in the end-section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catheter, in particular 
a catheter for angiographic purposes, comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a distal end and a proximal end provided 
with a connecting piece. In the catheter a pull wire is 
arranged, such that when the pull wire is pulled, the end 
section of the catheter bends in a controlled manner. A catheter of this kind is known from EP-A-0 361 314. With the invention as characterized in claim 1, an 
improved steerability of the catheter is achieved. The 
comparatively stiff sliding wire renders the end-section 
into which it extends stiff, so that primarily only that 
part of the end-section into which the sliding wire does not 
extend, bends. By advancing the sliding wire more or less 
far into its channel, the shape of the deflecting part can 
be adjusted. An advantageous embodiment is characterized in 
claim 3. The end-section and the basic body of the catheter 
may be extrusion profiles with a number of channels 
extending over the entire length. To allow proper and careful manipulation of the 
catheter according to the invention, the measure as set out 
in claim 4 is preferably applied. When in use the physician 
can hold the handle in one hand and operate the control 
means with a few fingers of the same hand. A very suitable embodiment is characterized in 
claim 5. The rotatable case can be operated with the thumb 
and index finger, while the handle is held with the other 
fingers. Transmission of the rotational movement of the case  
 
to the pull wire is effected in a very simple and reliable 
manner, also keeping the manufacturing costs of the 
contraption relatively low. To achieve adequate control of the sliding wire as 
well, the measure as set out in claim 6 is preferably 
applied. Adjustment of the sliding wire is achieved with the 
aid of the second control means after which the deflection 
can be further determined by using the first control means. The invention will be explained in greater detail 
in the following description with reference to the examples 
of the embodiments as shown in the drawings.

<CLAIMS>
Catheter comprising a tube-like basic body with 
a distal end and a proximal end provided with a connecting 

means, at least one continuous channel and with a flexible 
part at the distal end, wherein a pull wire, extending 

through the channel to the proximal end, is attached in the 
flexible end-section. 
Catheter as claimed in claim 1, wherein in the 
end-section the channel through which the pull wire extends 

is eccentrically positioned and the channel receiving the 
sliding wire is positioned diametrically opposite the 

channel containing the pull wire. 
Catheter as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
pull wire is doubled back in a hook-shaped fashion at its 

end and the bent end-piece is received in the channel 
receiving the sliding wire. 
Catheter as claimed in one of the previous 
claims, wherein a control means has been attached to the 

proximal end comprising a handle and a, in relation to the 
handle, moveable operating mechanism, wherein the basic body 

is attached to the handle and the end of the pull wire to 
the operating mechanism. 
Catheter as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
operating mechanism consists of a case which can be rotated 

around the handle and the pull wire is threaded into the 
handle and attached to the case via a tangential channel 

formed at the position of the case. 
Catheter as claimed in one of the claims 4 or 
5, wherein the control means comprises a second, in relation 

to the handle, moveable operating mechanism, to which the 
end of the sliding wire has been attached.
