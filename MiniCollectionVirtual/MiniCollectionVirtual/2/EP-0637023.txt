<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc on which a number of spiral trains 
of regular pits and at least one train of irregular pits 

are formed. The regular pits of each of the trains is 
arranged symmetrically with respect to the center of a 

track. Further, each of the irregular pits has a 
predetermined shape different from a shape of each of the 

regular pits. Moreover, an arrangement of the train of the 
irregular pits being differently from an arrangement of 

each of the trains of the regular pits. Furthermore, a 
tracking error signal being obtained from the train of the 

irregular pits. Such an irregular pit can not be copied 
even when a normal optical disc containing such 
an 
irregular pit is copied by performing a conventional 

copying method. Thus, an illegal copy disc can be 
discriminated from a normal optical disc by checking 

whether or not an irregular pit is included in an optical 
disc. Consequently, a good copy protection can be achieved 

by easily detecting an illegal copy disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical disc for use
in, for instance, a CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory),
which can prevent an unauthorized copying (namely, pirating)
of information recorded thereon (for example, software of a
video game (namely, a computer game)). Further, this
invention relates to a checking device for checking an
optical disc and determining whether or not the optical
disc contains information copied illegally. Moreover, this
invention relates to a recording device for recording
information on such an optical disc.Generally, both of a digital information signal and
an analog information signal can be used to designate same
information representing, for example, a piece of music, an
image, a character, data or the like. Further, it is well
known that when the information is copied (namely,
duplicated) from the digital information signal, there is
substantially no degradation in transmission quality or
characteristics of copied information in comparison with a 
case of copying the same information from the analog
information signal. Thus, a copying of original
information represented by a digital information signal
(namely, producing duplicate information just as good as
original information representing, for instance, a piece of
music) now becomes a serious problem in protecting a
copyright on original information such as information
representing a piece of music. Namely, there are demands
for inhibition of or limitation on a duplicating (or
copying) of a digital information signal.For instance, a CD-ROM or the like is manufactured
according to a public standard such as an ISO 9660 standard
established by International Standard Organization. When a
copying of original digital information from an optical
disc is prevented in conformity to this standard, a copy
protection code is preliminarily recorded on the optical
disc. Thus, an optical disc containing such a code is
determined as a normal disc. In contrast, if such a code
is not contained in an optical disc, this optical disc is
determined as an illegal copy disc. Further, appropriate
measures are taken (for example, a reproducing of
information from such an illegal copy disc is stopped).
Furthermore, it is expected that henceforth, a large part
of CD-ROMs will be manufactured in accordance with this
standard. However, even in case of employing such a copy
protection method, when using a copying device being
capable of performing what is called a disc copy (namely,
taking an exact copy of data recorded on an optical disc),
it is
