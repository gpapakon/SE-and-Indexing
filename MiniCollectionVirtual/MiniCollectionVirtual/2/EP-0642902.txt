<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for processing articles made from plastic, comprising a side-acting press followed by a shear cutter. The apparatus and the method may advantageously be applied to articles of elongate shape, such as pipes, which are firstly crushed by the press and then cut up by the shear cutter, this leading to the formation of fragments whose morphology and geometry depend on their nature, thereby making it easier subsequently to sort them.

<CLAIMS>
Method for processing plastic articles with the
expectation of classifying them, char
acterized in that the
said articles are squashed and then cut up.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the articles are squashed transversely in relation to

their largest dimension.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in that,
before squashing the articles transversely in relation to

their largest dimension and cutting them up, they are
squashed parallel to this dimension.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the articles comprise at

least one pipe.
