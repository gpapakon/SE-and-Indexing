<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the usable casting time in the casting of a workpiece in a mould (2) of sand or other material, at the same time avoiding any increase in station time, the invention proposes a device for positioning a pouring basin (1) or funnel made of mould material, in particular sand, on the mould (2). The device is characterized by a mechanism designed to inject and consolidate the pouring basin (1) or funnel and to place the consolidated basin (1) or funnel directly on the mould (2). Also proposed is a method of injecting and consolidating a pouring basin (1) or funnel of this kind and placing it directly on the mould (2).

plate (10) which extends centrally, approximately  
 

transverse to the direction of movement of the 
operating frame (8), and in that the operating 

frame (8) is axially displaceable via the drive 
plate (10) to press and, subsequently, press out 

the pouring basin (10) and to press on the sand 
mould (2), wherein the operating frame (8) is 

arranged in a sealing, displaceable manner between 
the inner wall of the blasting furnace (5) and the 

outer wall (11) of an inner block arranged 
approximately centrally in the blasting furnace. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that there is formed, inside the inner block, 

at least one cylinder (13) which acts as a 
pressing and pressing out cylinder, and can be 

acted on hydraulically or pneumatically; in that 
the drive plate (10) extends through the cylinder 

(13) in the manner of a piston, and in that the 
operating frame (8) is dimensioned and 

displaceably arranged in such a manner that it, or 
the seals (14) thereof which are directed towards 

the inner block (12), always seal off the passage 
(15) of the drive plate (19) by means of the inner 

block. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the blasting and clamping 

head (6) comprises a blasting air connection (16)  
 

and a blasting air filter (17), in particular for 
filtering the air which flows back after blasting, 

and can be displaced in a vertical manner by means 
of an upper clamping cylinder (18). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that at least one further 

blasting furnace (5) is provided; that the 
blasting furnaces (5) can, by means of a rotating 

device (21), be brought, in a reciprocal manner, 
out of the blasting and pressing position between 

the blasting and clamping head (6) into a press-out 
and, optionally, refilling position between 

the sand mould (2) and, optionally, a sand hopper 
(22), and in that the rotating device (21) 

comprises a pivot arm (25) which retains the 
blasting furnace (5) and which is, preferably, 

articulated in a vertical and rotationally 
displaceable manner approximately centrally
