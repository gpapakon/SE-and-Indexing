<ABSTRACT>
Linings obtained from fibres of two types of polyester of two 
different melting points are described. 
These linings are thermoformable, because of the difference in 
melting points of the components, and recyclable at the end of 

their life because of their entirely polyester based composition. 
These linings find application in the furnishing field and in 
particular for the manufacture of accessories for the automobile 

industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyester fibre based composite 
articles. More specifically, the invention relates to composite articles 
shapeable at will by heat treatment, which are free from resins or 
adhesives or in any event do not comprise the use of polymers 
other than polyester. The composite articles of the present invention may be used as 
linings for flat or undulated structures, for example in the 
furnishing field or, in particular, the automobile sector. Synthetic fibre based composite articles are widely used in the 
automobile industry as internal linings, for example carpets, roof 
panel linings, rear window underpanel linings etc. Such linings generally consist of a double layer, namely a felt-like 
exposed layer and a layer which confers shape to the article. The exposed layer, known as the pile, is generally obtained by 
using fibres worked according to the needle punching method, 
whereby numerous barbed needles repeatedly penetrate a bed of 
fibres, deposited by dry or wet methods, which causes interweaving 
of the fibres to obtain a felt. Polyamide, polypropylene or polyester fibres are generally used to  
 
produce this felt. An acrylic resin and/or polyethylene layer is 
subsequently added to the exposed layer, to adhere to this latter 
by means of heat treatment. In a further heat treatment at a 
higher temperature, the resin layer melts, becoming thermoformed 
to give the article its final shape. This resin layer is commonly 
known in the art as the backing, which will be the term used 
hereinafter in the description and claims. Products obtained in this way, although widely used, present 
numerous drawbacks in their preparation stage and in their final 
characteristics. In the first place, their preparation requires numerous production 
stages comprising: 
carding and needle punching of the fibres constituting the pile 
of the final product; resin bonding, ie the addition of the polymer which constitutes 
the backing to the felt produced in the preceding operation; and 
finally, thermoforming of the article. Another drawback is the fact that resin bonding is potentially 
polluting and toxic, in that the acrylic resin or polyethylene are 
used in fine powder form which develops dust clouds during resin 
handling and loading. A further drawback of these articles is the fact that the backing 
produced in the thermoforming operation is impermeable and non-transpirable 
making the articles thus obtained hygienically 
unsuitable for lining large surfaces. Finally, these articles

<CLAIMS>
Thermoformable composite articles obtained by using a non-woven 
fabric formed from: 


an upper exposed part, known as the pile, consisting of 
polyester fibres; and 
a lower part, known as the backing, consisting of a blend of 
fibres of the same polyester as that of the upper part and of 

fibres consisting totally or partially of a low-melting 
copolyester, wherein the low-melting part has a melting point at 

least 60°C lower than that of the polyester used for the pile 
fibres. 
Articles as claimed in claim 1, wherein the fibres forming 
the pile are produced by melt-spinning a polyester in which at 

least 95% of the acid radicals are terephthalic radicals. 
Articles as claimed in claim 2, wherein the polyester has 
an intrinsic viscosity of between 0.5 and 0.7 dl/g. 
Articles as claimed in claim 2, wherein the polyester has 
a density of between 1.3 and 1.5 g/cm³. 
Articles as claimed in claim 2, wherein the pile is 
obtained with polyester fibres of claims 2 to 4 having a count of 

between 0.8 and 30 dtex. 
Articles as claimed in claim 5, wherein the polyester 
articles have a count of between 3 and 20 dtex. 
Articles as claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein the fibres 
contain opacifiers, anti-static agents, antioxidants, optical 

whiteners, etc. 
Articles as claimed in claim 1, wherein the backing is 
 

produced from a blend of the fibres of claims 2 to 7 and fibres 
consisting exclusively of a thermobonding polyester. 
Articles as claimed in claim 8, wherein the thermobonding 
copolyester has a terephthalic/isophthalic comonomer ratio of 

between 50/50 and 90/10. 
Articles as claimed in claim 9, wherein the thermobonding 
copolyester has an intrinsic viscosity of between 0.5 and 0.6 

dl/g. 
Articles as claimed in claim 9, wherein the thermobonding 
copolyester has a density of between 1.2 and 1.6 g/cm³. 
Articles as claimed in claim 8, wherein the fibres formed 
from the thermobonding copolyester of claims 9 to 11 have a count 

of between 0.8 and 30 dtex. 
Articles as claimed in claim 12, wherein the thermobonding 
fibres have a count of between 3 and 20 dtex. 
Articles as claimed in claims 12 and 13, wherein the 
thermobonding fibres contain opacifiers, anti-static agents, 

antioxidants, optical whiteners etc. 
Articles as claimed in claim 1, wherein the backing is 
produced from a blend of the fibres of claims 2 to 7 and 

bicomponent fibres. 
Articles as claimed in claim 15, wherein the bicomponent 
fibres are of the side-by-side type obtained by melt-extruding the 

polyesters of claims 2 to 4 and thermobonding copolyesters of 
claims 9 to 11. 
Articles as claimed in claim 15, wherein the bicomponent 
fibres are of the sheath-core type, obtained by melt-extruding the 

 
polyesters of claims 2 to 4 and thermobonding copolyesters of claims 

9 to 11. 
Articles as claimed in claim 16 or 17, wherein the 
bicomponent fibres have a count of between 0.8 and 30 dtex. 
Thermoformable composite articles consisting completely of 
polyester produced by a process comprising the following stages: 


a) preparing a polyester fibre non-woven fabric for use as the 
pile; 
b) preparing a non-woven fabric of mixed polyester plus 
thermobonding polyester composition for use as the backing; 
c) joining together the non-woven fabrics obtained as described in 
points a) and b) by passing through a needle-punching device or 

similar machine; 
d) preforming.
