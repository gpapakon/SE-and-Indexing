<ABSTRACT>
A food mixer has a bowl 
guard suspended from the cylindrical transmission portion 

and covering the open top of the bowl while the mixing shaft 
is rotating. The guard has a fixed first splash guard 

portion (36) remote from an operator station and a second 
removable see-through portion (38) adjacent the operator station and 

pivotable about a vertical axis 
centrally of the transmission cylindrical portion. A plurality 

of circumferentially-spaced inwardly-facing guide shoes (52) on 
this second portion cooperate with a fixed track 

consisting of a cylindrical 
sheet metal band (30) surrounding and coaxially-fixed to a lower 

end of a cylindrical transmission portion (24). This band has 
an outwardly-directed integral horizontal bead (46) which extends 

essentially 360 degrees about the band and supports the 
pivotable portion by means of the guide shoes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to food mixing 
machines. Manufacturers of food equipment regularly seek to 
provide devices which limit access by users of the equipment 
to areas of operating machine elements while the elements 
are performing food altering or manipulating functions. In 
so doing, they have often made the equipment more complex. 
In turn, this design complexity has presented problems of 
machine cleanliness and loss of productivity during 
cleaning, particularly where the machines are of a 
batch-making type and must be cleaned between food batches 
or when changing batches from one type of food product to 
another. The more complex and cumbersome the design of 
guarding, the more difficult it can be to clean and maintain 
the cleanliness of the machine. This is particularly true 
where the guarding parts result in crevices being present in 
areas where food which is splashed, smeared or otherwise 
distributed collects in such crevices. Oftentimes, the 
guarding must enable visual inspection of the food during 
processing. This necessitates that the design be in the 
nature of a see-through cover which limits physical access 
to the product while allowing its visual inspection, but 
enables access when the guarding is removed from a covering  
 
position. Frequently, such guarding elements have some 
parts which are removable to enable their being taken to a 
sink for scrubbing, hosing or rinsing under a water faucet 
when cleaning is required. Some such equipment has 
attaching means for the guarding that is permanently fixed 
to the machine and therefore the guarding is incapable of 
being removed for scrubbing at a location remote from the 
machine. Such parts are often difficult to clean and 
maintain that way because of the food-collecting crevices 
which are not easily cleansed on the machine. It is not 
often that such food machines are used in an environment 
that allows for them to be hosed down. One such product, the food mixer, is subject to beating 
and whipping actions which are capable of causing batter to 
be splashed about, as much from operator bowl filling and 
removal operations as from the mixing function itself. When 
a mixing function has been completed, unless a batch of the 
same product is to be produced and some carryover is 
permissible, it is ordinarily necessary to clean the 
guarding means and surrounding areas. While some parts of a 
guarding means are typically removable for sink cleaning, 
other guard-mounting parts remain on the machine and must be 
wi

<CLAIMS>
A food mixer having an electric motor (M); a power 
transmission (24) driven thereby and having an essentially 

cylindrical portion with a rotary mixing shaft (26) extending 
downwardly therefrom; said shaft having means for receiving 

a mixing member (28) on its lower end for rotation with said 
shaft to mix food ingredients in an open-topped bowl (34) 

positioned therebelow; a bowl guard (35) suspended from said 
cylindrical transmission portion and covering the open top 

of said bowl while said mixing shaft is rotating, said guard 
comprising a fixed first splash guard portion (36) remote from an 

operator station and a second removable see-through portion (38) 
adjacent said operator station; said second portion being 

pivotable about a vertical axis centrally of said 
transmission cylindrical portion between a bowl-covering 

position encompassing that area of the open top of the bowl 
not covered by said splash guard portion and a bowl-access 

position in which said first and second portions are 
adjacent and essentially nested; a plurality of 

circumferentially-spaced inwardly-facing guide shoes (52) on said 
second portion adjacent said cylindrical transmission 

portion for enabling pivoting of said second see-through 
portion about said transmission; and fixed track means 

associated with said cylindrical transmission portion for 
slidably receiving said guide shoes; characterised in that 

said track means consists of a cylindrical sheet metal band (30) 
surrounding and coaxially-fixed to a lower end of said 

cylindrical transmission portion, said band having an 
outwardly-directed horizontal bead (46) integral therewith and 

extending essentially 360 degrees thereabout for supporting 
said pivotable portion by means of said guide shoes for 

enabling pivotal movement thereof between its bowl-covering 
and bowl-access positions, said bead and the adjacent outer 

surface of said band being essentially free of food-collecting 
crevices whereby, upon removal of said second  

 
portion for cleaning away from said mixer, the outer surface 

of said band and bead can be completely and easily wiped 
free of food splashed thereon during mixing. 
A food mixer according to Claim 1, further 
characterized in that said second portion of said bowl guard (38) 

comprises a wire cage assembly extending circumferentially 
and radially with respect to said cylindrical transmission 

portion (24). 
A food mixer according to Claims 1 or 2, further 
characterized in that said bead (46) is formed into said band (30) by 

metal working tools (64, 66) and is of the same thickness as the 
remainder of said sheet metal band. 
A food mixer according to Claim 3, further 
characterized in that said band (30) comprises a single sheet of 

metal formed into a cylinder by butt-welding the lengthwise 
ends of the sheet together, and in that said outwardly-directed 

bead is roll formed into said cylinder by 
cooperating male and female rotary tools (64, 66) on the inside and 

outside respectively of said cylinder. 
A food mixer according to Claim 4, further 
characterized in that the end of said band (30) nearest said bowl 

has an inwardly and upwardly turned roll-formed lip (32) 

providing a cup for retaining any potential leakage of oil 
from said transmission into said bowl. 
A food mixer according to Claim 5, further 
characterized in that said bead (46) and said cup (32) are closely 

positioned relative to each other at the lowermost end of 
said band when the band (30) is in position on said cylindrical 

transmission portion (24).  
 
A food mixer according to any preceding claim, 
further characterized in that said second see-through 

portion (38) of said bowl guard (35) includes a ring (50) for supporting 
said guide shoes (52) and suspending the second removable portion 

of said bowl guard therefrom, said shoes being three in 
number and essentially equally spaced 120 degrees about said 

ring, and in that at least a portion of one of said guide 
shoes is retractable relative to said bead (46) whereby said ring 

and second pivotable portion may be lowered, removed from 
said bead and cleaned at a location remote from the food 

mixer. 
A food mixer according to Claim 7, further 
characterized in that said one guide shoe (52) is mounted for 

outward movement relative to said ring (50) between a first 
position in which said one shoe is slidably supported about 

said bead (46) and a second position in which said one shoe 
clears at least the upper portion of said bead to enable the 

second pivotable portion (38) to be lowered for removal. 
A food mixer according to Claim 9, further 
characterized in that means (54, 56, 57) is provided to maintain said one 

shoe (52) in said first position when said second pivotable 
portion (38) is mounted on said food mixer for movement between 

said bowl-covering position and said bowl-access positions. 
A food mixer according to Claim 9, further 
characterized in that said means (54, 56, 57) to maintain said one shoe (52) 

in said first position comprises a two-part latch and detent 
means, one part on said ring (50) and the other part on said one 

shoe.
