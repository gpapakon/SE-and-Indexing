<ABSTRACT>
Device for cutting a protective layer away from a material roll (16) of web-formed material, comprising a rotation device (13, 14) which rotates the roll. The rotation device includes at least two rotatable carrier rollers, on which the material roll is supported and is rotated. In this way the protective layer on the material roll is cut away from the roll during a cutting operation by means of a cutting tool (4). This contacts the roll during its rotation. The rotatable carrier rollers form lifting and carrying means on a mobile load carrier (7) in order to support the material roll whilst rotating it during the cutting operation and in order to transport the material roll to and, respectively, from a chosen place for the cutting operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for cutting a 
protective layer away from a material roll of web-formed 
material, comprising a rotation device intended to rotate 
the roll, whereby the rotation device includes at least two 
rotatable carrier rollers, on which the material roll is 
supported and is arranged to rotate, whereby the protective 
layer on the material roll is cut away from the roll during 
a cutting operation by means of a cutting tool which is 
arranged to contact the roll during its rotation. For transport and storage of material rolls comprising web-formed 
material, for example paper, these are provided, in 
connection with manufacture, with a packaging in form of 
one or more protective layers on the end faces of the roll 
or covering layers of a strong material, for example coarse 
paper. Before the roll of web-formed material contained in 
the packaging is used, e.g. in the graphics industry, 
packaging industry etc., the protective layer is removed 
before the web material can be unrolled. It is known in the art (see document US-A-4821971) to remove the protective layer from 
material rolls by the material roll being transported to a 
station for so-called roll-stripping, whereby the roll is 
normally transported by means of a truck, unloaded to a 
rotation device at the station and whereupon by means of a 
knife the packaging is cut open during rotation of the 
roll. After removal of the packaging the material roll is 
again loaded onto a suitable load carrier for further  
 
transport to a following station for unrolling of the web-formed 
material. The actual removal of the protective layer 
is a relatively fast procedure, whilst the total procedure 
is however lengthened unfavourably by an unloading 
procedure both before and after the removal of the 
protective layer. The object of the present invention is to facilitate the 
procedure with removal of the protective layer from 
material rolls. Said object is achieved by means of a device according to 
the present invention, which is characterized in that said 
rotatable carrier rollers form lifting and carrying means 
on a mobile load carrier in order to support the material 
roll whilst rotating it during the cutting operation and to 
transport the material roll to and, respectively, from a 
chosen place for the cutting operation. The invention will be described more closely with reference 
to an embodiment and to the accompanying drawings, in which 
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of the arrangement 
according to the

Device for cutting a protective layer away from a 
material roll (16) of web-formed material, comprising a 

rotation device (13, 14) intended to rotate the roll (16), 
whereby the rotation device includes at least two rotatable 

carrier rollers (13, 14), on which the material roll (16) is supported 
and is arranged to rotate, whereby the protective layer on 

the material roll (16) is cut away from the roll (16) during a 
cutting operation by means of a cutting tool (4) which is 

arranged to contact the roll during its rotation, 

characterized
 in that said rotatable carrier 
rollers (13, 14) form lifting and carrying means on a mobile load 

carrier (7) in order to support the material roll (16) whilst 
rotating it during the cutting operation and to transport 

the material roll (16) to and, respectively, from a chosen place 
for the cutting operation. 
Device according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said carrier rollers 
(13, 14) are raisable and lowerable by means of a raisable 

and lowerable lifting arrangement (11) on the load carrier 
(7). 
Device according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said carrier rollers 
(13, 14) are arranged parallel to each other and are 

adjustable with regard to their mutual distance. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that said carrier rollers 
(13, 14) are each rotatably arranged in their respective 

fork leg on a forklift (11).  

 
Device according to claim 4, 

characterized
 in that at least one carrier 
roller (13, 14) is connected to a drive motor on the mobile 

load carrier (7) for rotation of said carrier roller. 
Device according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said cutting tool (4) 
is supported by a cutting device which forms a stationary 

unit (1) to which, respectively from which, the mobile unit 
(7) is displaced. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that said load carrier is 
constituted by an autocarrier included in an automatic load 

handling system, and in that the autocarrier is arranged to 
be placed into a cutting position, in which said cutting 

tool (4) is arranged to contact the roll's periphery. 
Device according to claim 6, 

characterized
 in that said rotation device 
(13, 14) comprises a stationary drive motor arranged, in 

said cutting position, to position a drive member against 
the material roll in order to effect its rotation. 
Device according to claim 8, 

characterized
 in that said drive motor is 
constituted by a drive roller in the form of a friction 

roller arranged to contact the periphery of the material 
roll (16).
