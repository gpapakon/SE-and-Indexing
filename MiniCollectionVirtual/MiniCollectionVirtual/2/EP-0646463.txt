<ABSTRACT>
In one embodiment, a metal restraining element 
(130/140) is used to reduce thermal expansion/contraction 

stress between a nozzle member (18) and a print cartridge 
body (12). In a preferred embodiment, a nozzle member 

containing an array of orifices (17) has a substrate (28), 
having heater elements (96/98) formed thereon, affixed to 

a back surface of the nozzle member. The back surface of 
the nozzle member extends beyond the outer edges of the 

substrate. Ink (99) is supplied from an ink reservoir 
within a print cartridge body to the orifices by a fluid 

channel (92/94) within a barrier layer (30) between the 
nozzle member and the substrate. The nozzle member is 

adhesively sealed with respect to the print cartridge body 
by forming an ink seal (90) circumscribing the substrate, 

between the back surface of the nozzle member and the 
body. A metal restraining element, in the form of bolts 

(140) or an insert (130), is affixed to the print 
cartridge body in the vicinity of the nozzle member to 

limit the thermal expansion of the body in a first 
direction when the print cartridge is heated during 

manufacturing or storage. This prevents delamination of 
the nozzle member from the barrier layer when the body and 

nozzle member cool after being heated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to inkjet and
other types of printers and, more particularly, to
reducing thermal expansion/contraction induced stress
between a nozzle member and a print cartridge body.Thermal inkjet print cartridges operate by rapidly
heating a small volume of ink to cause the ink to vaporize
and be ejected through one of a plurality of orifices so
as to print a dot of ink on a recording medium, such as a
sheet of paper. Typically, the orifices are arranged in
one or more linear arrays in a nozzle member. The
properly sequenced ejection of ink from each orifice
causes characters or other images to be printed upon the
paper as the printhead is moved relative to the paper.
The paper is typically shifted each time the printhead has
moved across the paper. The thermal inkjet printer is
fast and quiet, as only the ink strikes the paper. These
printers produce high quality printing and can be made
both compact and affordable.In one prior art design, the inkjet printhead
generally includes: (1) ink channels to supply ink from an
ink reservoir to each vaporization chamber proximate to an 
orifice; (2) a metal orifice plate or nozzle member in
which the orifices are formed in the required pattern; and
(3) a silicon substrate containing a series of thin film
resistors, one resistor per vaporization chamber.To print a single dot of ink, an electrical current
from an external power supply is passed through a selected
thin film resistor. The resistor is then heated, in turn
superheating a thin layer of the adjacent ink within a
vaporization chamber, causing explosive vaporization, and,
consequently, causing a droplet of ink to be ejected
through an associated orifice onto the paper.One prior art print cartridge is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,500,895 to Buck et al., entitled "Disposable
Inkjet Head," issued February 19, 1985 and assigned to the
present assignee.In one type of prior art inkjet printhead, disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,481 to Johnson, entitled "Thermal
Ink Jet Common-Slotted Ink Feed Printhead," ink is fed
from an ink reservoir to the various vaporization chambers
through an elongated hole formed in the substrate. The
ink then flows to a manifold area, formed in a barrier
layer between the substrate and a nozzle member, then into
a plurality of ink channels, and finally into the various
vaporization chambers. This prior art design may be
classified as a center feed design, whereby ink is fed to
the vaporization chambers from a central location then
distributed outward

An apparatus for an ink printer comprising:

a nozzle member (18) having a plurality of ink
orifices (17) formed therein;
a substrate (28) containing a plurality of ink
ejection elements (96/98), said substrate having two

or more outer edges, said substrate being mounted on
a back surface of said nozzle member, each of said

ink ejection elements being located proximate to an
associated ink orifice, said back surface of said

nozzle member extending over two or more of said
outer edges of said substrate;
a body (12) in fluid communication with an ink
reservoir, wherein said nozzle member is positioned

on said body and sealed with respect to said body by
a seal (90) between said body and said back surface

of said nozzle member substantially circumscribing
said substrate, said body being formed of a first

material, said body having a first coefficient of
thermal expansion in a first direction; and
a thermal expansion restraining element
(130/140) affixed to said body in the vicinity of

said nozzle member, said restraining element being
formed of a second material having a substantially

lower coefficient of thermal expansion than said
first coefficient of thermal expansion, wherein said

restraining element causes the coefficient of thermal
expansion of said body in said first direction in the

vicinity of said nozzle member to be substantially
less than said first coefficient of thermal

expansion.
The apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising a
fluid channel (52) communicating between said ink 

reservoir and a back surface of said substrate (28)
