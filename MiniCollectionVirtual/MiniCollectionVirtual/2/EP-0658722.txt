<ABSTRACT>
A light source system for collecting and directing light 
is disclosed. The light source system includes, preferably, 

light cubes (20) including an enclosure substantially surrounding 
a light emitter (26). The enclosure includes a body (22) 

enclosing a cavity (24). A plurality of light pipes (32) are 
disposed to extend through the body into the interior of the 

cavity, so that the light pipes (32) carry light from inside 
to outside the cavity. By utilizing a plurality of these light 

cubes, the intensity of light can be controlled by combining 
light from a plurality of such light sources into a combiner 

unti which combines the light from all of these sources into 
a single path. The intensity of light in the combiner output 

can be controlled by selectively turning on or off one or more 
of the light sources. The present invention thereby provides 

a high intensity light source which is rugged and easy to 
manufacture at low cost. The modular design provides built in 

redundancy and light intensity control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to light sources, and 
more particularly to a modular light source which encloses 
a light emitter and directs light out of the enclosure by 
means of light pipes. Many optical systems require a high intensity light 
source to be directed to specific locations separated 
from the light emitter. Fiber optic cables are an 
effective means for directing concentrated light beams to 
a desired location with a minimum of required space and 
relatively low light losses. Nevertheless, light losses 
in such systems are significant and a relatively high 
intensity lamp source is often required to generate a 
sufficient output. Four primary kinds of light sources are typically used 
in such systems. These include: 
1. Xenon arc lamp in a transparent quartz (fused 
silica) envelope. In Xenon arc lamps light energy is 
typically collected by external conic or aspheric 
reflectors. 2. Xenon arc sealed in a ceramic enclosure with an 
internal integral reflector and transparent exit window. 3. Xenon arc lamp in a transparent quartz envelope 
with multiple positive lenses to image the energy from the 
arc into fiber optic cables. 4. Xenon arc lamp in a transparent quartz envelope 
with a single light pipe. While the above kinds of lamps are generally effective 
for various applications, they do present a number of 
disadvantages. The quartz envelopes used in Nos. 1, 3 and 
4 are relatively expensive to manufacture and subject to 
breakage. This limits their usefulness in certain 
applications, or necessitates expensive ruggedizing 
mountings which add to their size and weight. Further, 
the risk of breakage in quartz arc lamps poses a safety 
concern. Also, the external reflector required in lamp 
No. 1 configuration adds significantly to the cost and 
size; and these components must be aligned when replaced 
in the field. No. 2 has the disadvantages of limited 
collection efficiency and, in many cases, noticeable 
thermal instability of the arc. Lamp No. 3 is relatively 
difficult to align and manufacture and also does not 
result in an extremely efficient light source due to the 
high losses from the limited collection capability of the 
refractive lenses. Likewise, No. 4, with a single light 
pipe does not collect an optimum amount of energy. Also, 
in Nos. 1, 3 and 4 there is a safety concern due to the 
high intensity visible or UV radiation emanating from the 
clear quartz envelope. Further, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 
not very efficient and provide little or no means for 
controlling
