<ABSTRACT>
Method fo monitoring the quality of an advancing yarn by continuously measuring the yarn tension, whereby determining the progression of the yarn tension upon occurrence of a defined failure (failure record), storing the failure record in a data memory, comparing the measured yarn tension with the failure record and generating an alarm signal, when a range of the yarn tension progression shows a similarity to the failure record.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method disclosing the method steps a) and b)
of claim 1.Such a method is known from EP-B1 207 471.The significance of the known method lies in that, in a texturing
process, the yarn tension is continuously determined, and that by
evaluating the yarn tension, however, it is not the progression of the
process that is determined, but the quality of the yarn processed by the
texturing method. This is based on the experience that the yarn tension,
which is measured in the texturing process downstream of the false twist
friction unit, allows with a certain evaluation of the yarn tension to draw
conclusions as to the quality of the produced yarn, without defining,
determining and gathering those process parameters, which are causal for
the quality or absence of quality.It is therefore the object of this invention to determine by
evaluation of the yarn tension which is continuously measured in the
course of the production and/or processing of a yarn, the causes of non-conformities,
which affect the quality of the yarn.The solution is achieved through a method according to claim
1.According to this solution, portions of the graphic record of the
yarn tension, the progression of which is symptomatic of certain, defined
non-conformities, is stored as a pattern for this non-conformity (failure
record), and subsequently compared with the progression of the yarn
tension. In the following test, by the term non-conformity it is 
understood a certain defect, trouble, error, fault or failure of the yarn
tension being different from a conformity state, i. e. a normal one. In
this comparison, it is considered that the progression of the yarn tension
in the course of time does not recur identically, when a certain non-conformity
occurs, but only with certain characteristics. In one
embodiment of this invention, the failure records are therefore not stored
as a defined function, but in a typified form, a possible scattering of the
progression of the yarn tension in the course of time being taken into
account. This means that the characteristic progression of the yarn
tension is stored, when a certain non-conformity occurs, but with such a
lack of definition or tolerance (non-conformity pattern) that the non-conformity
pattern is still indicative of the non-conformity with an
adequate certainty, whereas, on the other hand, it still covers as many
forms of the non-conformity record as possible in the case of the non-conformity
concerned.In a second embodiment of the invention, the non-conformity

<CLAIMS>
Method of monitoring the quality of an advancing yarn by the
following steps:


a) continuously measuring the yarn tension,
b) determining the progression of the yarn tension upon occurrence
of at least one defined non-conformity and
c) storing it as a non-conformity record or significant features
thereof in a memory;
d) comparing the measured yarn tension with the non-conformity
record; and
e) generating a signal, when a range of the yarn tension
progression shows a similarity to the at least one non-conformity

record.
Method as in claim 1 or 2,
characterized by

comparing the measured yarn tension with significant characteristic
parameters derived from the non-conformity record.
Method as in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the non-conformity is defined by its cause.
Method as in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the non-conformity is defined by its effect on the yarn property, in
particular its Uster value defining the evenness of its thickness over a

length, or its dyeability or its physical properties. 
Method as in one of the foregoing claims,
characterized by

the processing feature comprising:

storing the yarn tension measured on the advancing yarn for at least a
portion of the production process or processing operation in a data

memory as a yarn tension record; and
conducting the comparison of the measured yarn tension with the non-conformity
record, in that the non-conformity record is compared with all

partial lengths of the yarn tension record.
Method as in one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized by the step of

conducting the comparison of the measured yarn tension with the non-conformity
record, in that during the production process or processing

operation of the advancing yarn the yarn tension signal is continuously
compared with the stored non-conformity record.
Method as in one of the foregoing claims,
characterized by the further step of:

predetermining similarity criteria, generating and storing a non-conformity
mask by superimposing the failure record upon the similarity criteria, and

conducting the comparison of the measured yarn tension with the non-conformity
record, in that the non-conformity mask is compared with the

yarn tension.
Method as in claim 1,
further comprising the step of

scanning the measured yarn tension for significant parameters derived
from the non-conformity record. 
Method as in claim 7,
characterized in that

the similarity is defined by a correlation coefficient indicating the
percentage of measuring values being within the non-conformity mask.
Method as in claim 7,
characterized by the step of

outputting a probability signal indicative of a certain non-conformity,
such as:


x% of the measuring values are within the non-conformity record
or
y% probability for the non-conformity of "missing preparation"
or (100 - y%) of filament break.
