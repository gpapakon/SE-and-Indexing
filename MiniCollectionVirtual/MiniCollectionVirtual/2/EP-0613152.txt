<ABSTRACT>
A nuclear fuel rod (10) has a sealed, elongated hollow 
cladding tube (12) having an axial stack of fissile fuel pellets (16) 

contained within the tube (12). The pellets in the stack are 
provided in an arrangement of axial regions. A middle 

region (16.1) has fuel pellets having a first enrichment of U-235 
being greater than the enrichment of natural uranium. An 

axial blanket (16-2,16-3), disposed between the middle region and an 
end of the tube, has fuel pellets having a second enrichment 

of U-235 being greater than the enrichment of natural 
uranium and less than the first enrichment. The pellets of 

the axial blanket may be annular shaped to provide additional 
plenum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel rods for fuel 
assemblies used in nuclear reactors, in particular, mid-enrichment 
axial blankets for a nuclear fuel rod. The core of a light water nuclear reactor is 
typically made up of several fuel assemblies, which, in 
turn, are made up of an array of cylindrical fuel rods. 
Each fuel rod is a hollow tube sealed at each end and 
containing fissile material, such as uranium oxide, enriched 
with the uranium isotope having an atomic weight of 
235 (U-235). The bulk of the uranium in the fuel is the 
isotope having an atomic weight of 238 (U-238). The 
fissile fuel is typically in the form of pellets stacked 
within the fuel rod. The fuel rods are positioned so as to 
provide a neutron flux in the reactor core sufficient to 
support a high rate of nuclear fission, which in turn 
releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat. The 
fuel rods are vertically disposed and transversely spaced 
apart from one another such that liquid coolant can be 
pumped through the core and between the fuel rods, thus 
extracting heat generated by the nuclear reaction in the 
core for the production of useful work. Neutrons produced by the fissioning of the U-235 
atoms in turn induce the fissioning of more fuel atoms. 
Because they are surrounded by less fuel, neutrons released 
at the ends of the fuel rod have a greater probability of 
escaping from the core than do neutrons released in the 
middle of the fuel rod. The neutrons that escape do not 
produce further fission events. Thus, the fuel near the  
 
ends of the rods burns slower than the fuel towards the 
center. Initially, the spatial distribution of fission 
inducing neutrons is approximately cosinosoidal along the 
axis of the fuel rods. With burnup, the distribution 
becomes flatter. Overall, the depletion of fissile fuel, 
or burnup, along the length of the fuel rod is non-uniform, 
with the ends of the rod receiving less burnup than the 
center. This is inefficient utilization of the U-235 in 
the fuel rod ends. A fuel rod design that can increase the 
fuel utilization at the ends of the core will produce 
significant economic benefits because buying and enriching 
uranium is a significant part of the total fuel cycle cost. The typical approach used to increase fuel 
efficiency is to reduce neutron leakage by employing "axial 
blankets." Commonly, axial blankets are sections of 
natural uranium pellets having a U-235 enrichment of 0.711% 
by weight at both the top and bottom of the fuel rod.
