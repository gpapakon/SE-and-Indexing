<CLAIMS>
Bicycle wheel centring aid, comprising a clamping 
device (5) to be fitted on the frame or the fork (1) of 

a bicycle, a swivel arm (33) and a dial gauge (52) whose 
measuring pin (53) can be applied to the rim (2) to be 

measured, characterized in that the swivel arm (33) is 
joined rotatably and pivotably at one end to the clamping 

device (5) and at the other end to the dial gauge (52). 
Bicycle wheel centring aid according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the clamping device comprises two 

clamping arms (10, 11) which each have V-shaped clamping 
jaws (13, 14 and 16) at their free ends and which can be 

moved with respect to one another via a connecting rod 
(20) by means of a clamping screw (19). 
Bicycle wheel centring aid according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the swivel arm 

(33) is joined at each of its two ends by means of ball-and-socket 
joints (30, 60, 80) to the clamping device 

(5), on the one hand, and a dial holder (50) of the dial 
gauge (52), on the other hand. 
Bicycle wheel centring aid according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the swivel arm 

(33) comprises two parts (33a, b) which can be clamped 
with respect to one another by a clamping screw (35) and 

which have bores (80) for receiving ball-shaped ends of 
ball pins (30 or 60) of the clamping device (5) or of the 

dial holder (50). 
Bicycle wheel centring aid according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the dial gauge 

(52) has an analogue indicator.
