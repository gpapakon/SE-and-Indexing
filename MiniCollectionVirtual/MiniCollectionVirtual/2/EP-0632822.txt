<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes and compositions 
for cleaning fabrics, hard surfaces and the like using glycerol 
amides, a.k.a. N-(1,2-propanediol) fatty acid amides, as detersive 
surfactants. A wide variety of detersive surfactants are known in the 
literature and in commercial practice. Such surfactants range 
from common soap to sophisticated betaine and sulfobetaine synthetic 
surfactants. In general, the continuing search for new 
detersive surfactants has been the result of the desires of the 
formulator to meet a growing list of cleaning needs under a wide 
variety of conditions. Thus, the formulator of laundry detergents 
must provide products which remove from fabrics a wide variety of 
soils and stains, ranging from petroleum oils and fatty oils to 
proteins, carbohydrates, clay and other particulate soils, and 
mixtures of such soils and stains. Moreover, users of laundry 
detergents often employ widely disparate laundering conditions, 
ranging from cold water washing to hot water washing. Since usage 
habits are becoming less and less uniform, formulators are also 
required to provide the consumer with products which function well 
with a wide variety of soils and under a wide variety of usage 
conditions. In addition to the above-noted considerations, the formulators 
of laundry detergents in many areas of the world now find 
themselves prevented by various regulations from using phosphate 
detergency builders. Since phosphate builders were a mainstay for 
many heavy duty laundry detergents, their removal from consumer 
products has required very substantial reformulation efforts, 
especially for heavy duty laundry detergents.  
 Moreover, there is increasingly a perceived need to provide 
stable, effective detergent compositions which are formulated from 
renewable resources which do not rely on petrochemicals. In 
addition, there is a need to provide detergent formulations 
containing ingredients which perform well in combination with 
alkyl benzene sulfonate ("LAS") surfactants. Alternatively, the 
present invention provides high cleaning compositions which do not 
require the presence of LAS. This is particularly advantageous to 
formulators who wish to include detersive enzymes in their 
products, especially heavy duty liquid fabric laundering products, 
since LAS can degrade and deactivate such enzymes. The present invention employs the fatty acid amides of 
glycerol amines to address the aforementioned issues. Such amides 
provide substantial cleaning advantages,
