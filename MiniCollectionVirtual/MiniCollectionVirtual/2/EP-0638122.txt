<ABSTRACT>
DEN1-S275/90 (ECACC V92042111) is a new strain of Dengue virus serotype 1. The complete cDNA sequence of this virus has been cloned and protein-coding fragments thereof have been used in the construction of expression plasmids. DEN1-S275/90 in inactivated form, DEN1-S275/90 polypeptides or fusion proteins thereof can be incorporated into vaccines for immunisation against DEN1-S275/90 and other DEN1 viruses. The invention further provides diagnostic reagents e.g. labelled antibodies to DEN1-S275/90 proteins, and kits to detect DEN1 virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Dengue Virus Type 1. 
Dengue virus infection may lead to dengue fever (DF) or its 
more severe dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue 
shock syndrome (DSS). DHF is an important virus disease of 
global significance, especially in Southeast Asia. There 
are four serotypes of Denque virus (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3 and 
DEN4) belonging to the family Flaviviradae. The complete genomic sequence of DEN2 (Jamaica) has 
been published by Deubel et al; Virology 165, 234-244 
(1988). The complete genomic sequence of DEN3 (H87) has 
been published by Osatomi and Sumiyoshi; Virology 176, 643-647 
(1990). The complete genomic sequence of DEN4 has been 
published by Zhao et al; Virology 155, 77-88. To date, 
only a partial sequence of any variant of DEN1, DEN1 (Nauru 
Island), has been determined; Mason et al, Virology 161, 
262-267 (1987). We have now identified a previously unknown strain of 
DEN1 and established its complete nucleotide sequence. The 
new strain, DEN1-S275/90, was deposited at the European 
Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC) Porton Down, GB 
under Budapest Treaty conditions on 21 April 1992 and given 
accession number V92042111. DEN1-S275/90 differs 
significantly from DEN2, DEN3 and DEN4 in terms of sequence 
homology. There are also a number of significant 
differences between DEN1-S275/90 and DEN1 (Nauru Island). The present invention thus provides DEN1-S275/90 
(ECACC V92042111). The invention further provides DEN1-S275/90 
(ECACC V92042111) for use as a diagnostic reagent. 
The invention also provides DEN1-S275/90 in inactivated 
form for use as a diagnostic reagent or a vaccine. The invention also provides the nucleic acid sequence 
of Seq. ID No. 1 and DNA sequences substantially 
corresponding to SEQ ID No. 1, e.g. degenerate variants 
thereof having one or more nucleotide changes but  
 
nevertheless capable of being translated to give the same 
protein sequence. The invention further provides fragments 
of such DNA polynucleotides, in particular the fragments 
encoding the C, C',PreM, M, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 
NS4B and NS5 genes of the genome of the virus. The start 
and end points of these preferred fragments in the nucleic 
acid sequence of Seq I.D. No. 1 are shown below in Table 1. 
Table 1 also shows the start and end points of the proteins 
encoded by these genes, using the numbering of Seq. ID Nos. 
1 and 2. 
Start and end points of the nucleic acid (n) numbers encoding the genes of S275/90. The table also shows the start and end points
