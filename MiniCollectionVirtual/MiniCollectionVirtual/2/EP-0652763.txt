<ABSTRACT>
Raw extracts of blue algae (cyanophyceae), methods of preparation and applications in cosmetology and dermatology are disclosed. Said raw extracts of blue algae contain at least one substance selected from the following porphin ring derivatives: chlorophylls, chlorophyllides, chlorophyllines, phaeophytines and phaeophorbides, and may be obtained from a blue algae of the genus (Plectonema) by decoction or maceration of said algae, lyophilised or fresh, at a temperature from 20  C to 60  C in a solvent selected from the group consisting of mineral oils, vegetable oils, synthetic substitutes of natural oils, slightly polar organic solvents, water and solvents miscible with water.
