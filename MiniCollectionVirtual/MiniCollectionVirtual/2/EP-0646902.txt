<ABSTRACT>
A device for receiving and transferring a plurality of 
parallel signals is disclosed, which comprises input means 

(200) for receiving the plurality of parallel signals, first 
register means (202) coupled to said input means (200) for 

receiving the plurality of parallel signals and outputting a 
plurality of first serial output signals, transfer means (205, 

207) for transferring said serial output signals from said 
first register means (202), a second register means (208) for 

receiving the first output signals from the transfer means 
(205, 207) and for outputting a plurality of second serial 

output signals, at least one memory means (210, 211) for 
receiving the second output signals; and address means 

(213-219) for addressing said memory means for causing said 
memory means to reconstruct said plurality of parallel input 

signals so that the data stored in the at least one memory 
means (210, 211) is reconstructed back into the form in which 

the data is received in the plurality of parallel signals 
received by the input means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for receiving and 
transferring a plurality of parallel signals. The invention particularly concerns the receipt and 
processing of data signals which relate to the state of the 
power supply for a motor and also to operating parameters of 
said motor such as the angular position and the like. In view of the large number of signals which are detected 
and processed, it is desirable to provide a system for 
conveniently and simply transferring those signals from the 
sensors to a processor. The invention may also be said to reside in a device for 
receiving and transferring a plurality of signals, as defined 
in claim 1. Preferably the input means are converters or digital signal 
input circuits.  Preferably two memories are provided and the 
data from the second register means is loaded into each 
of said memories, switch means for switching between said 
memory so that one memory receives data from said second 
register means while the second memory outputs data, 
second switch means connected to the output of the 
memory means for switching between said first and second 
memories so that data outputted from said memories is 
selectively applied to a third register means. The invention will be described by way of 
example with reference to a preferred embodiment shown in 
the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a controller for 
a servo motor for raising and lowering a lift car in a 
lift well; Figure 2 is a block diagram for converting from 
rectangular to polar co-ordinates used in the embodiment 
of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a view of an isolator used in the 
embodiment of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a view of a device for the turn of 
the angular position of the motor controlled by the 
controller; Figure 5 is a view of a multiplexer/demultiplexer 
circuit according to the invention for receiving and transferring data 
signals detected by the controller of Figure 1; Figure 6 is a circuit diagram of the block 
diagram shown in Figure 2; and Figure 7 is a circuit diagram of a second 
embodiment of the block diagram shown in Figure 2. With reference to Figure 1 the controller 
includes six transistor bridge circuits 10 which are 
powered from a DC supply via a sine wave generator 12 and 
an oscillator circuit 14. The transistor bridge circuits 
10 are well known and therefore will not be described in 
further detail. A voltage clamp 16 is arranged parallel  
 
to the voltage supply. The output from the transistor 
bridge circuits is used to power
