<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cooling system for an 
internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder head (11) affixed 

to a cylinder block (7) defining a plurality of cylinders and a 
cylinder head coolant jacket (135) for circulating coolant between an 

intake and exhaust side of the cylinder head (11), said cylinder (11) 
head having at least one intake passage (11c) extending through one 

side of said cylinder head (11) and at least one exhaust passage (11d) 
extending through another side of said cylinder head (11). The 

cooling system is improved in that a flow regulating member (138) is 
provided in the cylinder head coolant jacket (135) between adjacent 

cylinders (XI,XL) for regulating a transverse flow of coolant through 
the cylinder head jacket (135) between the intake and exhaust sides. 

According to another aspect of the invention, the cylinder head 
coolant jacket (135) is communicated with the cylinder block coolant 

jacket (134) for circulating the coolant therethrough after cooling 
the cylinder head (11), and a coolant main passage (135a) is formed along 

one side of the cylinder head (11) for circulating the coolant 
through the cylinder head coolant jacket transversely from said 

one side to the opposite side of the cylinder head (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooling system for a
multiple cylinder internal combustion engine having a cylinder
head affixed to a cylinder block defining a plurality of
cylinders, said cylinder head having at least one intake
passage extending through one side of said cylinder head and at
least one exhaust passage extending through another side of
said cylinder head, said cooling system comprising a cylinder
head coolant jacket for circulating coolant between an intake
and exhaust side of the cylinder head, a cylinder block coolant
jacket for circulating coolant through the cylinder block,
whereby a plurality of flow regulating members are provided in
the cylinder head coolant jacket between adjacent cylinders
arranged in line for regulating a transverse flow of coolant
through the cylinder head jacket between the intake and exhaust
sides thereof, and a coolant main passage formed along one side
of the cylinder head for circulating the coolant through the
cylinder head coolant jacket transversely from said one side to
the opposite side of the cylinder head.As it is well known, it is desirable to take care to lower
preferably the temperature of the cylinder head enabling to
increase the engine output by increasing the permissible
combustion temperature. Of course, such a strategy requires
improved and forced cooling of the cylinder head. Therefore,
it has been deliberated to mount the water pump directly on the
cylinder head, in particular to install it at one side of the
engine, intending to supply cooling water to the cylinder head
prior to supplying cooling water to the cylinder block cooling
structure. However, under said design aspects, the internal
combustion engine tends to become bulky because the side face
of the cylinder head in a crankshaft direction is provided with
intake and exhaust pipes and any location of the water pump at
the cylinder head requires to avoid interference with these
pipes. In order to provide a compact cooling structure, it has already
been proposed, to connect the delivery port of a coolant pump
with a coolant jacket for the cylinder block. The cylinder
block coolant jacket is communicated with the cylinder block
coolant jacket via passages integrally formed in the cylinder
block and the cylinder head, respectively, so that the coolant
which is introduced into the cylinder block coolant jacket from
the discharge side of the pump and circulated through said
cylinder block coolant jacket, flows into the cylinder head
coolant jacket after cooling the cylinder block
