<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ophthalmic surgical system and method
including a disposable surgical microkeratome and, more particularly, to a
surgical system and method for using such a device in laser in situ
keratomileusis (LASIK).In the past thirty-five years, several opthalmic surgical methods and
devices have been developed and increasingly are used to change the shape of
the cornea to correct vision defects, including myopia, hyperopia and
astigmatism.An early technique included a "primary keratectomy" in which an anterior
corneal lenticle is removed by manually pushing a blade of a microkeratome
across the cornea. Then a "refractive keratectomy" is performed, wherein an
optic correction is carved in the surface of the lenticle with a lathe similar to a
contact lens lathe. The lenticle is sutured back in place on the eye. When an
even and smooth cut is achieved, the best and most predictable results are
obtained. However, the manual microkeratomes are difficult to use and require
some skill to propel the blade across the cornea in an even and smooth manner,
thereby providing varying qualities of primary keratectomies based on the skill
and experience of the surgeon. As a result, the predictability of the refractive
correction was minimal.The methods and devices have evolved over the years to an automated,
mechanical movement of the microkeratome blade across the cornea which
provides a steady, even cut and which improves the predictability of the
refractive correction. Furthermore, the lenticle is not completely severed from
the cornea. Instead a flap is cut from the cornea, the back of the flap or the
exposed stromal bed is sculpted in situ with a laser to provide the refractive 
correction, and the flap is replaced without sutures. This procedure is called
laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). LASIK greatly improves the predictability of
the amount of change in refractive correction and greatly reduces the amount of
time required for the cornea to heal. In addition, the patient experiences a
relative lack of discomfort from this procedure.Unfortunately, problems still remain with some microkeratomes used to
make the flap. Some existing microkeratomes still require the surgeon to
estimate the length of the cut to make the flap because the cutting distance is
not automated. Furthermore, generally microkeratomes are made of surgical
steel which prevents the surgeon from viewing the cornea as the cutting blade
oscillates and advances.Another problem with some microkeratomes is that they are made of

A microkeratome (12) for keratomileusis ophthalmic surgery comprising:

a base (92), a carriage (74) mounted to
the base and a cutting blade (98) carried in the carriage, the carriage being

guided for movement in an axial cutting direction and the cutting blade being
movable in an oscillating motion transverse to the cutting direction,

   wherein the carriage is movable in the cutting direction without
imparting the oscillating motion to the cutting blade,
characterized in that
 the base (92) comprises an anchor (78)
wherein the carriage is

connectable to an axially movable shaft (64) movable within a sheath (68) of
an axial cable (20) and the sheath is connectable to the anchor such that axial

movement of the shaft effects linear movement of the carriage relative to the
base.
The microkeratome of claim 1, in combination with the axially movable
shaft.
The microkeratome of any preceding claim, wherein the base includes
at least one guide (82) to retain the carriage adjacent the base and to direct

the axial movement of the carriage in the axial cutting direction.
The microkeratome of any preceding claim, wherein the base has an
opening (84) extending from a top surface (80) of the base to a suction

chamber (86) on a bottom side of the base, the suction chamber being
adapted to be seated on an eye such that at least a portion of a cornea of the

eye passes through the opening and protrudes above the top surface of the
base.
The microkeratome of claim 4, wherein the base includes a fixture (90)
having a passage therethrough to the suction chamber, the fixture being

connectable to a vacuum source (26). 
A microkeratome as set forth in any preceding claim, wherein the
carriage includes a cutting head (94) having an angled bottom surface (104)

with a transverse slot (114) opening thereto, at least one recess (130) in the
angled bottom surface and a back surface with a passage (140) extending

therethrough to communicate with the transverse slot; a blade holder (96)
having a vertical slot (138) and being received in the transverse slot of the

cutting head for transverse movement therein, a portion (120) of the blade
holder extending below the bottom surface of the cutting head; the cutting

blade having a cutting edge (102) and a central opening (122), the blade
holder engaging the central opening in the cutting blade for transverse

movement therewith; a wedge (100) having an angled top surface (106)
substantially parallel to the angled bottom surface of the cutting head with at

least one protrusion (128) extending therefrom to engage the at least one
recess in the cutting head and hold the wedge against the cutting head and

thereby retain the blade holder and cutting blade;

   wherein the vertical slot in the blade holder communicates with the
passage in the cutting head for receiving an eccentric (147) on an end of a

rotating shaft (66) to convert rotational motion into a transverse oscillating
motion of the blade holder and the cutting blade; and

   wherein the cutting assembly is adapted to receive a connection (149)
to an axial shaft for moving the cutting assembly across the base.
The microkeratome of claim 6, wherein the transverse slot is
perpendicular to the angled bottom surface of the cutting head and the

passage through the cutting head is parallel to the angled bottom surface.
The microkeratome of claim 6, wherein the carriage is adapted to
receive a coupling (149) adjacent the passage through the cutting head to

retain the eccentric therein.
