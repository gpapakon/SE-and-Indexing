<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vulcanizable 
compositions of fluorinated elastomers and polymeric 
liquid-crystals, displaying excellent processability 
and improved mechanical properties. Under the term "fluorinated elastomers" or 
"fluoroelastomers" both fluoroelastomers and 
perfluoroelastomers are meant, i.e., partially or 
totally fluorinated, non-crystalline polymers or 
copolymers which display elastomeric properties when 
they are submitted to vulcanization. A review of the 
main fluoroelastomers presently available on the 
market is reported in "Encyclopedia of Polymer Science 
and Engineering", Vol. 7, page 258. Fluoroelastomers withstand higher temperatures 
than 150°C and are stable to oxygen, sulfur oxide, 
amines and hydrofluoric acid. Fluoroelastomers are inherently endowed with a 
considerably high resistance to oils and fuels, 
alifatic and aromatic solvents, hydraulic fluids, 
polar solvents and diluted solutions of acids and 
bases. Furthermore, they are permeable to high 
temperature gases and are radiation resistant. Thanks to particular formulations, the chemical 
resistance can be extended to acids, steam, high-temperature 
water and concentrated alkalies. In fact, 
users have available a plurality of fluorinated 
elastomers having different molecular weight, and 
different crosslinking agents, e.g., bis-phenol,  
 
peroxides, diamines and, last but not least, high-energy 
radiations. Thanks to their extremely good properties, 
fluoroelastomers are enjoying wider and wider 
applications in particular sectors, e.g., in 
automotive industry (e.g., O-rings, sealing gaskets, 
tubes intended to come into contact with fuels). A use of fluoelastomers is also being developing 
in petroleum field, in particular when drillings have 
to be carried out under high depth conditions. In 
these cases, high temperature and pressure values 
(higher temperatures than 150°C, and pressures which 
may easily reach 400 bars), and the presence of 
aggressive materials (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) make it 
necessary high-duty materials to be used. As a 
consequence, the gaskets of the safety valves for oil 
wells and of the drilling equipment are made from 
fluorinated elastomers. However, namely in the field of oil and natural 
gas drilling, materials are required which display 
even better performance and higher mechanical 
properties, in particular as relates hardness, modulus 
of rigidity (both at low temperature, and at higher 
temperatures than 150°C), high-temperature compression 
set. The present
