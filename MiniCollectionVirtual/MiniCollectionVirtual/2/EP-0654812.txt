<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotating anode X-ray tube with a slide bearing, in particular a spiral-groove bearing, for bearing the rotating anode, which comprises a stationary and a rotatable bearing part, a liquid lubricant being provided between the two bearing parts and at least one of the two bearing parts comprising at least one lubricant channel with capillary action. A particularly simple production of the lubricant channel is in this case achieved in that the lubricant channel has a larger cross-section than is permissible for achieving a capillary action and that there is arranged in the lubricant a member which is wettable by the lubricant, extends at least over part of the length of the lubricant channel and reduces the clear cross-section in the lubricant channel to such an extent that a capillary action results.

<CLAIMS>
A rotary-anode X-ray tube comprising a sleeve bearing, notably a helical-groove 
bearing, which serves to journal the rotary anode and comprises a stationary (8) 

and a rotatable bearing portion (9), a liquid lubricant being present between the two 
bearing portions and at least one of the two bearing portions comprising at least one 

capillary-type lubricant duct (12), 
characterized in that
 the lubricant duct has a cross-section 
which is greater than permitted so as to achieve a capillary effect and that in the 

lubricant there is arranged a member which can be wetted by the lubricant and extends 
at least over a part of the length of the lubricant duct and reduce
s the free cross-section 
in the lubricant duct to such an extent that a capillary effect is obtained. 
A rotary-anode X-ray tube as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in 
the lubricant duct there is arranged a wire whose outer diameter is smaller than the 

inner diameter of the lubricant duct. 
A rotary-anode X-ray tube as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 in 
one location, preferably at the end, the wire is shaped so that it is clamped in the 

lubricant duct. 
A rotary-anode X-ray tube as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an 
open-pore member is arranged in the lubricant duct.
