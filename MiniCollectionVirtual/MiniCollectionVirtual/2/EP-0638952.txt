<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery containing a coulometric
charge indicator device which is capable of displaying the capacity of the
battery during and as a result of discharge.Batteries are generally stored for various periods of time before being
put into use. Typically, the batteries are stored by the seller and they are then
frequently stored again by the purchaser before being put to use. In view of the
fact that the batteries could be stored for long periods of time before finally
being used, it would be desirable to have some form of testing means in order
to determine if a stored battery, for example, has been partially discharged and
thus may not have sufficient charge remaining to operate a desired device.Battery testers have been developed to measure the strength remaining in
the battery. However, the first such devices were completely separate from the
battery itself. More recently battery testers which are either included in the
battery package or form part of the label secured to the battery have been
proposed. Such testers generally indicate the capacity remaining in the battery.U.S. Patent No. 4,702,564 discloses a device for testing a battery,
particularly a small, portable battery, comprising a flexible, transparent
substrate on which is deposited a narrow band of a black light-absorbing
material. A conductive material, which may taper outwardly in opposite
directions from a central point to a pair of outer terminals, is then deposited on
top of the substrate, either on the same side of the substrate as the light-absorbing
layer or on the side of the substrate opposite that containing the light-absorbing
layer. A layer of a cholesteric liquid crystal material is then
deposited on the substrate, either on the opposite side from the light-absorbing
layer or over the absorbing layer. The conductive material is an epoxy cement-based
conductor, preferably silver, printed or painted directly on the substrate.
An indicator scale is located along sections of the conductive material. In order to test a dry cell battery using this device, the terminal ends of
the conductive material are placed in contact with the battery terminals, causing
a current to flow. This heats the conductive material, the heat generated being
the most intense at the central point and radiating outwardly. The heat is
transferred through the thin substrate to the liquid crystal layer which results in
a colour change in the liquid crystal. The traverse of the colour change along
the length of the indicator scale,
