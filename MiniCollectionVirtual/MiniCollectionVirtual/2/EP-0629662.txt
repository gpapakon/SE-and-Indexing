<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition which comprises 95 to 60 volume % of a 
resin mixture of 40 to 85 % by weight of a copolymer between 

D-hydroxybutyrate and D-hydroxyvalerate containing 8 to 15 mol 
% of D-hydroxyvalerate-derived monomer unit and 60 to 15 % by 

weight of poly-ε-caprlactone, and 5 to 40 volume % of an 
inorganic filler or fillers, a porous film produced from the 

resin composition and having a void volume of 10 to 70 %, and a 
process for producing the porous film are disclosed. The film 

can be produced by melting the resin composition, forming it 
into a film, and stretching the film in at least one direction. 

The porous film can easily be degraded by microorganisms. 
Examples of the inorganic filler include barium sulfate, with 

the particle size being preferably 0.1 to 10.0 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition, a porous
film which is produced from the composition and is readily
degraded by microorganisms under natural conditions, and a
process for producing the film.Porous films produced by compounding a polyolefin resin
such as polyethylene or polypropylene resin with an inorganic
filler or fillers such as calcium carbonate or barium sulfate,
melting and filming the mixture, then stretching the resulting
film have been used in many fields as various wrapping
materials, medical supplies, clothing materials, etc. However,
plastics represented by polyolefin resins are chemically so
stable that used plastic products will keep their shape over a
long period of time when left under natural conditions. In
addition, they will become voluminous waste for their weight
due to the low density of the plastics. Thus, disposal of used
plastic products have become a serious object of public concern.On the other hand, it has been conducted to mix an
organic substance such as starch in polymers for the purpose of
solving the problem of disposal of used plastic products.
However, the resins themselves are not degraded, though the
organic substance such as starch is degraded and the plastic
products lose their shape. Hence, this technique of mixing the
organic substance fails to completely solve the problem of
disposal of used plastic products.As plastics which are biodegradable by microorganisms
such as bacteria and molds, there are illustrated chemically
synthesized aliphatic polyester resins represented by poly-ε
-caprolactone and aliphatic polyesters yielded by
microorganisms such as a polyhydroxybutyrate polymer and a
copolymer between hydroxybutyrate and hydroxyvalerate.However, these biodegradable resins have the defects of
low melting points, poor workability, expensiveness, etc. In
order to improve their workability, it has been proposed to 
blend polyhydroxybutyrate with poly-ε-caprolactone (Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. H3-157450) or to add a filler
such as calcium carbonate or starch to the aliphatic polyester
to thereby control degradation rate or decrease the price
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H4-146952).As to the former blending technique, however, only
polyhydroxybutyrate is disclosed as a resin component to be
mixed with poly-ε-caprolactone, as described above, and it is
not disclosed to blend with a copolymer between hydroxybutyrate
and hydroxyvalerate. As to the latter filler-adding technique,
only polyhydroxybutyrate,
