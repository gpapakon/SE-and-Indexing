<ABSTRACT>
An induction logging instrument for measurement while 
drilling applications is formed from a non-magnetic centre 

tube (28). A transmitter coil or coils (30) and one or 
more receiver coils (32, 34) are wound on the tube. Each 

coil is spaced from the centre tube by a sleeve of 
magnetically permeable core material (36) and lines of 

flux associated with each coil link through the core 
material rather than the centre tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to induction logging instruments of 
the type designed to measure the resistivity/conductivity 
of formations through which boreholes are drilled for oil, 
gas or other minerals. A standard induction logging instrument is known as an 
induction sonde and comprises an elongate non-magnetic 
mandrel. This may be introduced into a bore hole which 
passes though various formations. On one end of the 
mandrel there is wound a transmitter coil and on the other 
end a receiver coil. An AC current is applied to the 
transmitter coil and this creates a magnetic field in the 
formation adjacent to the sonde. This alternating 
magnetic field causes a current to flow in the formation 
around the section of the bore hole in which the sonde is 
present in a ground loop. This alternating current in the 
ground loop in turn has a magnetic field associated with 
it and this creates a further alternating field which cuts 
through the conductors of the receiver coil thereby 
inducing an alternating current in the receiver coil. The 
amount of current induced in the receiver coil is a 
function of the conductivity of the ground loop. Thus 
different currents will be induced in the receiver coil in 
dependence on the conductivity of the formation 
surrounding the sonde. Mutual induction between the 
transmitter and receiver coils is eliminated by use of a 
phase sensitive detector which eliminates quadrature 
signals. Most induction sondes used in practice have combinations 
of, for example, 5, 6 or 8 receiver coils and one or more 
transmitter coils. The extra coils are used to eliminate 
undesired signals or to focus the measurements being made. In order to obtain accurate readings no significant eddy  
 
currents should be induced in the material forming the 
mandrel. For this reason the mandrel is made of non-conducting 
material and also of non-magnetic materials so 
that it will not interfere with the magnetic field induced 
in the formation. A mandrel formed of glass fibre 
composite material and conventional engineering plastics 
is suitable to meet these requirements. It is conventional for measurements using sondes of the 
type described above to be used after a borehole has been 
drilled. The sonde forms part of an instrumentation 
string passed into the borehole. Because it is formed 
from solid plastics material to maintain its strength 
cabling for other instrumentation cannot pass it and thus 
it is always positioned at the distal end of an 
instrumentation string. For certain
