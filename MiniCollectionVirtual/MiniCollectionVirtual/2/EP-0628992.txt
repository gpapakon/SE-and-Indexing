<ABSTRACT>
A method for a flatter semiconductor wafer free of ORP 
-observed irregularity and particles generated in handling 

on the back side of the wafer, in which an alkaline etching 
is adopted to utilize its advantage and a slight polishing 

step is combined to a conventional method of this kind. A 
deficiency of alkaline etching which brings about rougher 

surface irregularities on the surface of a wafer is 
eliminated by the use of the step of slight polishing on the 

back surface after the etching step and the inherent 
advantage stands without a loss, so that particle generation 

from the back surface of a semiconductor wafer in handling 
is much reduced and what's more a flatter semiconductor 

wafer is realized and a yield of an electronic device 
fabrication grows the higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making
semiconductor wafers, and more particularly of making
monocrystalline silicon wafers for use in fabrication of
semiconductor devices.In general, a method of making semiconductor wafers
comprises the steps of slicing a monocrystalline ingot
pulled in a monocrystalline ingot puller to obtain thin
disk-shaped wafers; chamfering the wafer periphery to
prevent cracks in and chipping off of the thus sliced wafer
in the following step; lapping the chamfered wafer to
flatten the surfaces; etching off the work damage retained
in the lapped wafer; polishing the etched wafer across one 
of the surfaces; and cleaning the polished wafer to remove
the residual of a polishing slurry and the other foreign
substances on the wafer.It is known that there are available an acid etching
that uses an acid etching solution such as a mixed acid and
an alkaline etching that uses an alkaline solution such as a
sodium hydroxide solution as the etching treatment of the
above mentioned etching.In the acid etching, a higher etching rate is attained
and there is observed a finer surface texture under 0.6µm
in roughness (the peak-to-valley height) and under 10µm in
roughness spacing as shown in Fig.4, whereas in the alkaline
etching a lower etching rate is attained and there is
observed a rougher surface texture as large as 10 to 20µm
in roughness spacing (and sometimes over 1.5µm in the peak-to-valley
height).Methods of making semiconductor wafers as described
above are disclosed, for example, in S.M. Sze, "V251 Technology,
Second Edition" (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1988), pages 34 to 44.On the surface of the acid-etched wafer, a waviness
(hereinafter referred to an ORP-observed irregularity)
having a waviness spacing of 5 to 20 mm and the peak-to-valley
height under 0.2µm is produced, so that the
flatness of such wafer is poor as shown in Fig.6. On the 
other hand, on the surface of the alkaline etched wafer,
none of the above described ORP-observed irregularity is
produced and therefore the flatness of the wafer surface is
kept during the etching in a rather good condition as shown
in Fig. 6. In the Fig. 6 the ordinate axis in the
rectangular coordinate system represents the local surface
height measured with respect to a reference plane as the
index of the flatness.The ORP is the short for Optical Reflection Projector
which is designed on the basis of the widely known Magic
Mirror Principle or Magic Mirror Topography. Incident beams
