<ABSTRACT>
Compounds which are derived from (Bauhinia purpurea) lectin by replacement of one or more lysine residues in the molecule with other amino acid residues which either preserve the positive charge at the position of the substitution or provide a neutral residue at the position of the substitution are effective larvicides against insects such as European corn borer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Derivatives of Bauhinia purpurea Lectin and Their Use as LarvicideεCross-Reference to Copending ApplicationThis is a continuation-in-part of prior copending U.S. Patent Application Number 07/921,179, filed July 24, 1992. Technical FieldThis invention relates to materials and methods for killing insect larvae which are harmful to plants, and materials and methods for imparting insect resistance to plants, material harvested from the plants, and products derived from the harvested material. Background of the InventionNumerous insects are serious pests of common agricul¬ tural crops. One method of controlling insects has been to apply insecticidal organic or semiorganic chemicals to crops. This method has numerous, art-recognized problems. A more recent method of control of insect pests has been the use of biological control organisms which are typically natural predators of the troublesome insects. These include other insects, fungi (milky-spore) and bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis cv., commonly referred to as "Bt"). However, it is difficult to apply biological control organisms to large areas, and even more difficult to cause those living organisms to remain in the treated area for an extended period. Still more recently, techniques in recombinant DNA have provided the opportunity to insert into plant cells cloned genes which express insecticidal toxins derived from biological control organisms such as Bt. This technol jgy has given rise to additional concerns about eventual insect resistance to well-known, naturally occurring insect toxins, particularly in the face of heavy selection pressure, which may occur in some areas. Thus, a continuing need exists to identify naturally occurring insecticidal toxins which can be formed by plant cells directly by translation of a structural gene. 

 The lectin from Bauhinia purpurea is a glycoprotein the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of which indicates a polypeptide chain comprising 262 amino acids that include 7 lysine residues. See, e.g., "cDNA Cloning and Expression of Bauhinia purpurea Lectin," Kusui et al. , J. Biochem. 109, 899-903 (1991). This lectin has been determined by Czapla et al. to have larvicidal activity against European corn borer, as disclosed in the copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application "Larvicidal Lectins and Plant Insect Resistance Based Thereon," filed September 20, 1991, Serial No. 07/763,100. One of us is also a coinventor of that application. Other insects show little susceptibility to this lectin, and acquired

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS: l.A compound having the non-lysine amino acid sequence of Bauhinia purpurea lectin but wherein one or more of the lysine residues is replaced by an amino acid selected from Ala, Arg, Asn, Gin, Gly, His, lie, Leu, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr,
Trp, Tyr, and Val.
2.A method of killing or inhibiting insect larvae, comprising administering enterally to the larvae a larvicidal or feeding inhibitory amount of a compound according to Claim 1.
3.A method according to Claim 2 wherein the compound is administered enterally by incorporating the compound in the diet of the larvae.
4.A method according to Claim 5 wherein the diet of the larvae comprises the tissues of a living plant.
5.A method for protecting a plant, harvested material from the plant, and products derived from the harvested material against infestation by insect larvae comprising inserting into the genome of the plant at least one sequence coding for a peptide compound according to claim 1 or a combination of such compounds in proper reading frame relative to transcription initiator and promoter sequences active in the plant to cause expression of the sequence or sequences at levels which provide a larvicidal amount of the gene product in the tissues of the plant or harvested material of the plant which are normally infested by the larvae.
6.A method according to Claim 5 wherein the plant is a monocotyledonous species selected from corn, wheat, rice, oats, rye, and sorghum.
7.A method according to Claim 5 wherein the plant is a dicotyledonous species selected from soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, alfalfa, cotton, melon, cucumber, lettuce, pepper and tomato. 8. A DNA sequence which codes for a compound according to Claim 1 or a combination of such compounds.
9.An expression cassette comprising a DNA sequence according to Claim 8 operably linked to plant regulatory sequences which cause the expression of the DNA clone in 


plant cells.
10.An expression cassette comprising a DNA sequence according to Claim 8 operably linked to bacterial expression regulatory sequences which cause the expression of the DNA clone in bacterial cells.
11.Bacterial cells containing as a foreign plasmid at least one copy of an expression cassette according to Claim 10.
12.Transformed plant cells containing as foreign DNA at least one copy of the DNA sequence of an expression cassette according to Claim 9.
13.Transformed cells according to Claim 12, further characterized in being cells of a monocotyledonous species.
14.Transformed cells according to Claim 13, further characterized in being maize, sorghum, wheat, oat, rye or rice cells.
15. Transformed cells according to Claim 12, further characterized in being cells of a dicotyledonous species.
16.Transformed cells according to Claim 15, further characterized in being soybean, alfalfa, sunflower, rapeseed, cotton, melon, cucumber, pepper, lettuce or tomato cells.
17.A transformed maize plant, the cells of which contain as foreign DNA at least one copy of the DNA sequence of an expression cassette according to Claim 9.
18.A larvicidal composition, comprising a larvicidal amount of a compound according to Claim 1 or a combination of such compounds in a non phytotoxic vehicle.
19.A method of killing or controlling insect pests of harvested plant material, comprising applying to the harvested material a composition according to claim 18.
20.A method of killing or controlling insect pests of harvested plant material, comprising incorporating into the harvested materials a compound according to Claim 1 or a combination thereof.
