<ABSTRACT>
An organic material is used as the protective film 
in the ink ejecting printer head with the surface roughness 

Ra of the protective film is set to be no greater 
than 3. Accordingly, the segregation of ink components is 

suppressed to ensure a smooth flow of ink. As a result, 
the variations in the volume of the ink droplets ejected 

is reduced and the ejecting stability is improved. 
Therefore, the ink ejecting printer head having such a 

protective film that is excellent in protection also 
improves the stability of the ejected ink droplets and can 

be manufactured at a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink ejecting printer head
having at least one wall defining an ink chamber, the wall
being formed of a piezoelectric ceramics plate.WO 89/07752 discloses an ink jet system in which a
pressure chamber is formed with a wall of piezoelectric
material. The chamber is coated with a layer of material
providing a smooth, continuous, ink-wettable surface
conforming to the configuration of the chamber walls and
intended to prevent nucleation and the formation of
bubbles.As an ink ejecting printer head using a piezoelectric
ceramics plate, there has conventionally been proposed
a drop-on-demand type of ink ejecting printer head.
In this type of ink ejecting printer head, the volume of a
groove formed in a piezoelectric ceramics plate is changed
by deforming the piezoelectric ceramics plate. When the
volume is decreased, ink contained in the groove is
expelled in the form of droplets from a nozzle, whereas
when the volume is increased, additional ink is introduced
from an ink supply passage into the groove. A plurality
of such nozzles are arranged in a neighboring relationship
to each other, and the ink droplets are expelled from
desired ones of the nozzles according to desired print
data to thereby form desired characters or images on a
sheet of paper opposed to the nozzles.This kind of ink ejecting printer head is disclosed
in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,879,568, 4,887,100,
4,992,808, 5,003,679, 5,028,936 and 5,016,028, for example.
Figs. 5 to 8 schematically show such a conventional
ink ejecting printer head. The structure of such a conventional ink ejecting
printer head will now be described with reference to Fig.
5 showing a cross section thereof. The ink ejecting
printer head comprises a piezoelectric ceramics plate 1
and a cover plate 2. The piezoelectric ceramics plate 1
has a plurality of grooves 12 and is polarized in a
direction depicted by an arrow 4. The cover plate 2 is
formed of a ceramics material or a resin material. The
piezoelectric ceramics plate 1 and the cover plate 2 are
bonded together by an adhesive layer 3 formed of an epoxy
adhesive, for example, whereby the plural grooves 12 are 
formed as a plurality of ink channels. Each ink channel
is rectangular in cross section and is elongated over the
length of the piezoelectric ceramics plate 1. A plurality
of side walls 11 defining the ink channels extend over the
length thereof. The adhesive layer 3 is formed on the
upper surface of each side wall 11. A pair of metal
electrodes 13 for applying a driving electric field are
fo
