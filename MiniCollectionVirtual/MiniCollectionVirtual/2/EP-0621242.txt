<ABSTRACT>
A multiple glass feed system for use with a glass forehearth 
including a plurality of closely spaced plungers (12), each of 

which is individually adjusted independently of the other. The 
upper end (14) of each plunger is oval in cross section and 

the lower end (15) is round. The oval portions (14) of the 
plungers are provided in side by side relation with the long 

axis of each oval portion parallel to the long axis of the 
adjacent plungers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multiple orifice feed systems for
producing glass gobs.In the manufacture of glass articles, it is common to
provide a glass forehearth and multiple orifices which are
controlled by reciprocable needles or plungers in order to
provide the necessary uniform weight of gobs. Plural needles
and orifices are utilized in order to maximize glass
production.Typical systems are shown in United States Patents
1,529,948, 1,792,932, 1,926,764, 3,711,266, 4,478,631,
4,554,000, 4,581,054, and 4,793,849.In such systems, the plungers are conventionally round in
cross section. When the plungers are long, on the order of
0,76 to 1,22 m (30" to 48") long, with diameters about 50,8
to 63,5 mm (2 to 2 1/2") the strength of the plungers may not
be adequate.Among the objectives of the present invention are to provide
a multiple orifice feed system wherein the plungers are
configured such that they have greater strength and
durability; wherein the increased strength is achieved
without affecting the placement of the plungers; and wherein
the plungers can be positioned in closely spaced
relationship as desired.This objective is achieved by the multiple orifice glass feed system
defined in claim 1. Fig. 1 is a part sectional elevational view of a
multiple orifice feed system for producing glass gobs embodying
the invention.Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line 2-2
in Fig. 1.Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the plungers,
parts being broken away.Fig. 4 is a front elevational view of a plunger shown
in Fig. 1.Fig. 5 is a fragmentary bottom view taken in the
direction of the arrow 5 in FIG. 6, parts being broken away.Fig. 6 is a fragmentary side view on an enlarged scale
of a portion of the support mechanism for the plungers shown in
Fig. 3.Fig. 7 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the
horizontal line 7-7 in Fig. 6.Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken along the line 8-8
in Fig. 7. Referring to Fig. 1, the multiple orifice glass feed
system embodying the invention comprises a bowl 10 of a forehearth
11 and a plurality of plungers 12 that function in connection
with orifices 13. The plungers 12 are reciprocable to control
the flow of glass out of the orifices 13 so that when associated
shears, not shown, are used the size and weight of the gobs is
consistent.In accordance with the invention, each plunger 12 has
an upper portion 14 that is oval in horizontal cross section and a
lower portion 15 that is cylindrical in horizontal cross section.
The plungers are supported by clamping mechanisms

<CLAIMS>
A multiple orifice class feed system for use with a glass
forehearth including


a plurality of closely spaced vertical plungers (12),
each said plunger (12) having an upper portion (14) and a
lower portion (15),
each said upper portion (14) having an upper end,
each said upper portion (14) being oval in horizontal
cross section and having a long axis and a short axis,
each said lower portion (15) being cylindrical in
horizontal cross section,
said long axis of each said oval upper portion (14)
defining a main center plane,
means (16) for engaging the upper ends of said plungers
(12) and supporting said plungers in closely spaced side-by-side

relationship with the main center planes of
adjacent plungers (12) being parallel,
said means (16) being constructed and arranged to
vertically adjust said plungers (12) independently, and
said upper oval portion (14) of each said plunger having
the same oval cross section and said lower cylindrical

portion (15) of each said plunger (12) having the same
diameter.
The multiple glass orifice feed system set forth in claim
1 wherein said means (16) engaging and supporting said

plungers (12) comprises a clamping mechanism individual to
each said plunger. 
The multiple glass orifice feed system set forth in claim
2 wherein each said clamping mechanism (16) comprises an

oval chuck housing (21) individual to each said plunger
(12) into which the upper end of said plunger extends, a

curved liner plate (24) interposed within said housing
(21) and means (25) extending between said housing (21)

and said liner plate (24) to cause said plate to engage
said plunger (12) and clamp said plunger in said housing

(21).
