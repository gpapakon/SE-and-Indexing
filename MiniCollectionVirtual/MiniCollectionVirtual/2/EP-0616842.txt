<ABSTRACT>
Gels, stable at a predetermined service temperature 
and formed from silicone solvent fluids and a solute gelator, 

are disclosed. The solute gelator is selected from stearic 
acid; 12-hydroxystearic acid; metal salts of 12-hydroxy- 

stearic acid; metal salts of stearic acid and admixtures 
thereof. The solute gelator is dissolved in the silicone 

solvent and forms a solution therewith that is supersaturated 
at the predetermined service temperature. The gelator is 

then precipitated from the solution, forming a three- 
dimensional fibrous network that imparts sufficient mechanicl 

properties to the silicone solvent to form a gel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gelling silicone fluids 
and more specifically to the formation of such gels 
wherein stearic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid or a metal 
salt of either compound, is used as a gelator. The formation of gels from fluids such as organic 
solvents is known in the art; see, for example, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,790,961 which discloses the formation of 
thermally reversible gels from organic solvents and a 
gelator of the general formula R₁-(CH₂)n-CO₂-R₂ wherein 
R₁, n and R₂ are defined therein. While this patent 
indicates that silicone oil is included in the general 
class of organic solvents, no specific examples of 
silicone gelation are disclosed. Other materials which form gels when combined with 
organic solvents have also been taught. Tachibana et 
al. (Vol. 42, No. 12, Bulletin Of The Chemical Society of 
Japan, pp. 3422 - 3424 [1969]) report the formation of 
gels from various organic solvents (including mineral oil 
and ethanol) by utilizing 12-hydroxystearic acid and its 
lithium salt as gelling agents. While this prior art discloses gelling organic solvents, 
there has long existed a need for a simple means for 
gelling silicones. Gelled silicones are very desirable 
for use in the manufacture of lubricants and cosmetic 
vehicles. An ideal gelator should work in low concentration so as 
not to interfere with the desirable physical and chemical 
properties of the silicone. Furthermore, the gelator 
should not interfere with the intended use of the gelled 
silicone. For example, a gelator that is toxic would  
 
have little or no value for cosmetic formulations and 
vehicles. Finally, the silicone gel formed in conjunction 
with the gelator should be stable. As used herein, the term 
"stable" means that, at a predetermined service temperature, 
the silicone fluid will not leach or separate from the gel 
under the influence of gravity. Accordingly, a stable 
silicone gel will remain in gel form indefinitely if 
protected from chemical contamination, mechanical shock and 
evaporation loss. The present invention provides a gelled silicone 
solvent comprising a silicone solvent in combination with a 
gel-forming amount of a solute gelator. The gelled silicone 
solvent is stable at a predetermined service temperature and 
the solute gelator has limited solubility in the silicone 
solvent at the predetermined service temperature. In its 
untreated state, the silicone solvent is normally fluid at 
the predetermined service temperature. The solute gelator is 
selected from stearic
