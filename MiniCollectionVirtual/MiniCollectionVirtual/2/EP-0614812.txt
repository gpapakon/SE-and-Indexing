<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nozzle assembly
for filling a container with a homogeneous mixture of viscous
fluids. This invention provides a nozzle assembly which can
eject a volume of a highly viscous material, such as a
sealant, while simultaneously folding into the sealant a
highly viscous second fluid, such as a coloring agent, for
imparting color to the resultant volume of highly viscous
materials.In the manufacture of colored sealants, it is
desirable to mix coloring agents with the sealant as close as
possible to the point of packaging of the material. This is
called "point of packaging" pigmentation. The general idea
is to mix pigment into the base sealant at the last possible
moment before filling a package, such as a cartridge, tube,
drum or other container. In these processes, clean-up is
limited to the pigment mixing process at the end of the
production line.Currently, processes for coloring sealants involve
frequent changeovers from color to color. First, the base
sealant is compounded using known technology, catalyzed and
packaged in cartridges, drums or bulk containers. The
containers are then moved to a separate color production
process area for pigmentation. Many different color pigments
are needed to make the variety of colors and shades required
by the market place. Matching a specific desired color can
require sophisticated blending of a number of pigments.
Typically, production personnel load the base sealant into a
large mixer and meter the necessary coloring agent into the
mixer to produce a desired colored sealant. The ingredients
are mixed for a given time and checked for a good color match 
using standard colorimetry technology. The addition of
pigment is also limited because the pigment can cause
degradation of the physical properties of the resultant
sealant.When the color of the sealant is determined to be
correct, the sealant is moved to a proportionating machine
where the sealant is dosed into cartridges, drums or bulk
containers through the use of a one-part volumetric dosing
system. When the packaging is completed, the mixer blade,
mixer, proportionating machine and dosing system must all be
cleaned before the next run. Approximately 10% of any given
batch is lost in this cleaning process.The above-mentioned systems generally include an
injection nozzle. As material is pumped through the
injection nozzle, a volume of material is formed within the
nozzle which over time passes through the nozzle and exits to
fill containers.Nozzles have been developed in the
