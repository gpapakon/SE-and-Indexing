<ABSTRACT>
To accommodate placement of both input and output media 
trays (54, 56) on the same side of the housing of an 

ink-jet printer (50) for operator convenience, a paper 
path with a direction reversal is employed. A radiant 

print heater (108) with a reflector cavity (110) heats 
the medium (90) at the print area to increase the ink 

carrier evaporation rate. The printer provides 
improved medium control at the print area through an 

arrangement of small diameter drive and tension shafts 
(160, 162) and shortened handoff distance between the 

rollers. The heater is disposed between the drive and 
tension rollers. To minimise the handoff distance, 

portions of the drive rollers (100A, 100B) extend into 
the reflector cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to European Application EP-A-0568172 
and to the European Patent Applications 0622225 
entitled DUAL FEED PAPER PATH FOR INK-JET PRINTER, and 
0622223 entitled MULTI-PURPOSE PAPER PATH COMPONENT FOR 
INK-JET PRINTER.  
 The present invention relates to the field of ink-jet 
printers. With the advent of computers came the need for devices 
which could produce the results of computer generated work 
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this 
purpose were simple modifications of the then current 
electric typewriter technology. But these devices could 
not produce graphics or multicolored images, nor could they 
print as rapidly as was desired. Numerous advances have been made in the field. The 
impact dot matrix printer is still widely used, but is not 
as fast or as durable as required in many applications, and 
cannot easily produce high definition color printouts. The 
development of the thermal ink-jet printer has solved many 
of these problems. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,728,963, issued to S.O. Rasmussen et al., describes an 
example of this type of printer technology. Thermal ink-jet printers employ a plurality of resistor 
elements to expel droplets of ink through an associated 
plurality of nozzles. In particular, each resistor element, 
which is typically a pad of resistive material about 
50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a chamber filled with 
ink supplied from an ink reservoir comprising an ink-jet 
cartridge. A nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of 
nozzles, or openings, with each nozzle associated with a 
resistor element, defines a part of the chamber. Upon the 
energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of 
ink is expelled by droplet vaporization through the nozzle 
toward the print medium, whether paper, fabric, or the 
like. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the 
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are 
conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements.  
 The ink cartridge containing the nozzles is moved 
repeatedly across the width of the medium to be printed 
upon. At each of a designated number of increments of this 
movement across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused 
either to eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according 
to the program output of the controlling microprocessor. 
Each completed movement across the medium can print 
a swath approximately as wide as the number of nozzles 
arranged in a column on the ink cartridge multiplied times 
the distance between nozzle

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer (50) having improved media 
control at a print area (104), including a printhead for 

ejecting ink droplets onto a print medium (90) in a 
controlled fashion at the print area, and comprising 


first media drive means for advancing said print 
medium (90) through a media path during print operations 

to position said medium in relation to said 
printhead, said first drive means comprising first and 

second drive roller means (100A, 100B) mounted on a 
first drive shaft (160) and spaced so as to engage 

opposed margins of said medium, said first and second 
roller means having a substantially larger diameter 

than a diameter of said shaft, said first drive means 
positioned immediately adjacent said print area (104) 

at a media input side of said print area such that 
said first and second roller means extend into said 

opposed marginal areas of said print area for engaging 
said medium and driving said medium through said print 

area; and 
second media drive means, comprising a third 
drive roller means (114) mounted on a second drive 

shaft (162), said third roller means having a diameter
