<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a storage battery having a plurality of cells and a central degassing system, there is provided in the side wall of the storage battery cover a recess (8), into which a slide-in part (9) having a flame-arresting frit (5), situated obliquely with respect to the electrolyte level, and a gas outlet (4) is inserted in a manner sealed at the edges. Condensate which has been deposited on the frit from the gas stream flows away over the inclined base of the frit chamber (6) and is collected in the acid trap (10). The entire recess is accessible from the gas-collecting channel not directly, but via a side channel (3), and is laterally offset with respect to the gas-collecting channel on account of this route diversion. In the event of excessive acid deposition, the side channel serves to return acid into the storage battery.

<CLAIMS>
A multi-cell battery having a central gas venting means 
integrated in the battery cover and, downstream of the central 

gas venting means, a porous frit acting as a protection against 
explosion, characterized in that the gas collecting duct (2) is 

arranged in a line connecting the battery plugs or lying parallel 
thereto, and in that there is provided, laterally thereto in the 

side wall of the cover, a depression (8) which is connected by 
a side duct (3) to the collecting duct (2), and in that there is 

arranged in the depression an insert part (9) which contains the 
frit (5) closing the gas duct and which is connected to the cover 

in gas-tight manner. 
A multi-cell battery according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the frit is arranged in the insert part obliquely in 

relation to the electrolyte surface, and in that a collecting 
container (10) is provided below the frit for electrolyte 

deposited at the frit. 
A multi-cell battery according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the frit is arranged such that its lower 

edge is always above the level of the acid return flow. 
A multi-cell battery according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that webs (7) are provided in the side duct to 

divert the gas flow. 
A multi-cell battery according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that there is a depression in both side walls 

of the battery cover. 
A multi-cell battery according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that one of the depressions contains a sensor 

insert by means of which data relating to the status of the  
 

battery may be detected. 
A multi-cell battery according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that one of the depressions is widened and 

contains a porous frit and a sensor.
