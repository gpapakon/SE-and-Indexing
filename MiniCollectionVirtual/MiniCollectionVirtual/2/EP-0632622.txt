<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for temporally spacing the cell transmissions belonging to messages. It consists:   - in storing the value of the address of the first cell of the said message in relation to its transmission time, then   - at each time given by a local clock, - in reading the address value which is in relation to the said local time,   - in initiating transmission of the cell having the said address, - in calculating the transmission time of the next cell of the said message, - in determining the address of the next cell of the said message, and - in storing the address value of the next cell in relation to its transmission time thus calculated.   The present invention also relates to spacing devices for implementing this method.

Method for temporally spacing, with a given period, the transmission of cells
belonging to messages, the said messages being stored in a message memory such that their

cells are stored at consecutive addresses in the said message memory, a period being
assigned to each message, whereby it entails:


during an initialization phase of message transmission, storage in a segment in the
address memory (PD) ofthe address value in the said message memory (MPDU) of the first

cell of the said message in relation to its transmission time (Hre), then
at each time given by a local time (Hloc);

reading off the address value contained in the address memory segment
(PD) relating to the said local time (Hloc);
initiating transmission of the cell with the said address in the message
memory (MPDU);
calculating, by addition, firstly of the period assigned to the message to
which the said cell belongs and, secondly, the transmission time of the said cell, the

transmission time of the next cell of the said message;
determining the address of the next cell of the said message by incrementing
the address of the said current cell and
storing the address value of the next cell, determined as above, in a segment
in the address memory in relation to its calculated transmission time.
Method as per claim 1, whereby association of an address value and a time is achieved
by addressing a segment in the address memory (ADPU) with a signal representing the said

time, the content of the said segment being the said address value (PD).
Method as per claim 1, whereby the association of an address value and time is achieved
by storing the said value and time in two fields in the same segment of the said address

memory.

transmission times (Hre) ofthe corresponding cells respectively, the values of addresses are

stored in the said message memory of the cells to be transmitted;
