<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of repairing turbine blades. according
to the preamble of Claim 1. Such a method is described for example in EP-A-0101164.In use, turbine blades are subject to at least one of erosion damage
and cracking due to high stress in the blade.The tip of a turbine blade in a rotor assembly is the part of the blade
which experiences maximum velocity and is hence the part subject to the greatest
erosion.The present invention relates primarily but not exclusively to blades
used in steam turbines. Erosion or damage of steam turbine blades generally
occurs following contact between the turbine blades and either particles carried
by the steam or water droplets.Damage can occur from metal or other solid particles, for example
boiler scale, entering a steam turbine with the steam flow and striking the blades.
Water droplet damage is generally restricted to the final stages of a turbine.
However, all stages of a turbine can be affected by particle damage.The rate of erosion of turbine blades is dependent upon the relative
speeds between the blades and the particles or water droplets causing the erosion
and it is generally the leading edge at the outer end of each blade that is most
prone to erosion by impact.At the low pressure end of a steam turbine the steam is at a lower
temperature having been cooled during passage through the turbine and at the
dew point water droplets precipitate giving rise to "wetter" steam. The transfer
of energy by impact in the turbine blades of the steam is therefore greater at the
lower pressure end than at the high pressure end of the turbine. Once again it
is predominantly the outer ends of the blades which are especially subject to
erosion. To reduce the rate of erosion, it is usual to provide a shield at the
leading edge of the outer end of the turbine blade, such a shield being made from
a material harder than the blade material.Steam turbine blades may be made from many suitable materials, a
typical example being a 12 - 13% chrome steel and the shield may be made from
stellite or a suitably hardened steel. The shield may be brazed or welded to the
blade.After a period of use it is often found that the shield has been
considerably eroded and one accepted method of repair is to first remove the old
shield and secure a new shield in place either by brazing or welding the new
shield to the blade or building up a new shield depositing fused metal in a
welding operation. The blade is then machined in the area of the repair to return
it to its original

<CLAIMS>
A method of repairing a twine blade (10) which includes performing a
heating operation on the blade (10) in which the blade is heated to achieve a predetermined

temperature distribution sensing the temperature of the blade (10) at least at one position
by temperature sensing means (57) and controlling the application of heat in accordance

with the temperature determined by said at least one sensing means (57) characterised in
that the method further comprising the step of monitoring (70) the temperature of the

blade at a location adjacent said at least one position with a monitoring means (57
a
), and in
that in the event of a fault in said temperature sensing means (57) said monitoring means

(57
a
) is substituted for said temperature sensing means (57) to control the application of
heat to the turbine blades (10).
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the method further
comprises the steps of applying heating means (30 to 35) to selected areas of a turbine

blade (10) to be repaired, heating said areas of the turbine blade to desired temperatures
sensing the temperature of the blade at positions associated with said areas by respective

temperature sensing means (57), and controlling (40) the application of heat by said heating
means in accordance with the temperature determined by the respective temperature

sensing means (57) and monitoring (70) the temperature of the blade (10) at a location
adjacent each of said positions with said monitoring means (57
a
).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the monitoring
is performed with a temperature sensitive device (57
a
) separate from a temperature sensing
means (57) by which the temperature at said at least one position is sensed.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that
said monitoring means (57
a
, 70) is connected to an indicating means comprising at last
one of an audible and a visible alarm signal.
A method according to claim 4 characterised in that the indicating means is
activated as a result of the monitoring means (57
a
, 70) sensing that the temperature of the
blade (10) at said location lies outside said predetermined temperature distribution. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that
the indicating means (57
a
, 70) includes a visual display unit which indicates the temperature
sensed by the monitoring means (57
a
, 70) and/or provides a historic record of temperature
displayed against time.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that
the monitoring means (57
a
, 70) provides a control signal to a heating unit (50) to disable or
otherwise control tile heating unit (50) if the temperature sensed by the monitoring means

(57
a
, 70) lies outside predetermined range.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that
before or after the repair operation, heat is applied to the turbine blade (10) and the turbine

blade is maintained at a temperature, or a series of different temperatures, for a
predetermined length of time such as to eliminate or substantially reduce, stress present in

said blade (10).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims charaterised in that a
plurality of blades are repaired by first achieving a desired temperature distribution are for a

sample blade by determining a heating specification by selecting positioning and energising
at least one heating means (31) on the sample blade and then applying a similar heating

specification to each other blade.
