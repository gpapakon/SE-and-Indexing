<ABSTRACT>
An equalisation arrangement compensates for multipath phase and amplitude 
distortion effects in a transmission channel by first measuring such distortion effects 

as they occur over time in a calibration phase, thereby obtaining phase and amplitude 
compensation factors, then applying these factors at the appropriate times during a 

subsequent data transmission phase to a correcting means situated in the signal path. 
Calibration is achieved by feeding a received calibration signal to an amplifier, 

preferably a successive detection logarithmic amplifier (26), comparing the phase of 
the limited linear output of the logarithmic amplifier with a delayed version of itself 

(30, 28), and using the amplitude information (39) in the logarithmic output (72) of the 
logarithmic amplifier (26) and the phase-change information (35) resulting from the 

phase comparison to compute phase and amplitude compensation coefficients. In the 
data transmission phase, the compensation coefficients are applied to amplifiers and 

multipliers, etc (56, 55), in the correcting means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of correcting for amplitude and phase distortions in a
transmission system due to, for example, multipath propagation.Communications systems employing radio, ultra-sonic, infra-red or optical transmission
are well known in the art. It is a common problem in such systems, however, that under
certain circumstances propagation of the transmitted signal takes place not only along
one path, but along two or more paths simultaneously. When this occurs, multiple
signals are received at the receiving antenna at times which depend on the length of the
individual propagation paths. The result may be distortion in both the phase and
amplitude of the received signal. Such a situation is illustrated in Figure 1. Line (a) of
Figure 1 shows the situation at a time t1 as a receive antenna picks up a transmitted
signal 10 of wavelength π and zero-crossing phase of 0, π, 2π, etc., relative to the
ordinate 11. This is a signal from a direct propagation path. Subsequently, at a time t2,
the same signal but from a different propagation path arrives at the antenna and
interferes with the already received signal in (a). This newly arrived signal is shown as
signal 12 in line (b) of Figure 1. The result of the superimposition of the two signals 10
and 12 is the dotted waveform 13 and this waveform can be seen both to have a larger
amplitude than signal 10 and to bear a different zero-crossing phase relationship with it,
namely 1, π + 1, 2π + 1, etc.Finally, due to a further propagation path, a third signal 14 arrives at the antenna (see
line (c)) and this interferes with the composite signal 13 to produce a final composite 15 
having still greater amplitude, due to constructive interference, and a phase relationship
of 2, π + 2, 2π + 2, etc, relative to signal 10. Thus it can be seen that the effect of
multipath propagation is to distort the amplitude and phase characteristics of the
received signal with respect to the transmitted signal. Note that, for simplicity, signals
12 and 14 have been shown to have the same amplitude as signal 10; in reality, their
amplitude may well be much smaller due to attenuation factors in transmission,
resulting in a composite waveform 15 manifesting amplitude and phase distortions less
severe than those shown in line Figure 1.Such distortion can be especially troublesome when digitally modulated signals are
being received, as, when the distortion is severe enough, the information relating to one
symbol in a data chain can interfere with the information
