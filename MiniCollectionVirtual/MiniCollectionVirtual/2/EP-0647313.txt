<ABSTRACT>
A variable area flowmeter (10) employing a vertical tube (12) containing a displaceable magnet (20) and a closed-loop magnetic detection circuit (28, 30). The closed-loop magnetic detection circuit (28, 30) includes first and second magnetic cores (24, 26) each having a sense coil (58) and a compensation coil (60). The sense coil (58) provides an output related to magnetic field strength. With a feedback technique, the compensation coil (60) compensates for the magnetic field (22) through the sense coil (58). Field strength is determined by monitoring feedback. Displacement of the displaceable magnet (20) is determined using information from the first and second magnetic cores (24, 26). The detection circuit (28, 30) produces an output proportional to the position of the magnet (20) within the tube (12). This output is translated into fluid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic detection system
for use in a variable area fluid flowmeter. More specifically, the invention
relates to a device for measuring the rate of fluid flow by detecting the
position of a magnetic field created by a magnet displaceable by a fluid flow
inside a vertical pipe.In the prior art, a variable area fluid flowmeter consists of two
parts, one part inside the pipe for producing physical displacement of a
magnet, and another part outside the pipe for detecting the field produced
by the magnet and measuring the magnet's distance from a reference
position.Prior art arrangements usually consist of a vertical pipe fitted
with a horizontal orifice plate having a central round orifice. A conic plug
is placed inside the pipe, the plug has a vertical pin for vertical guidance of
the plug. The pin slides through two rings which are affixed to the pipe and
restricts motion of the plug within the pipe to a vertical direction. The plug
is free to slide up. and down in the pipe. When there is no fluid flow, the
conic plug rests in the central orifice. When there is fluid flow, the conic
plug slides upwards until the open area between the plug and the orifice is
large enough so that the gravitational force on the plug is equal to the force
induced by fluid flow. The conic plug contains a bar magnet that produces
a magnetic field which extends outside the pipe. The field which extends
beyond the pipe is detected by various techniquesOne detection technique (DE-A-1 773 798) involves placing a second bar magnet
outside the pipe. The second magnet is placed near the conic plug with its
poles opposite to the poles of the magnet in the conic plug. The second bar
magnet is pivotably mounted and movement of the conic plug causes the
second magnet to rotate. Rotation of the second bar magnet is detected 
with means such as a variable resistor. The displacement of the bar magnet
inside the conic plug is calculated from the rotation of the second bar
magnet. This technique is cumbersome and requires added mechanical
elements which are less reliable than electrical components. Another prior
art sensing technique involves placing multiple solid state electrically
resistive elements in the external magnetic field. The resistance of these
elements varies as a function of the magnetic field. By measuring the
resistance, the displacement of the conic plug can be calculated. The
resistive elements require a significant amount of power, which is added to
the power required to perform the
