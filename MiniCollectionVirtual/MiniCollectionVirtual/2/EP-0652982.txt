<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the electrolytic processing of flat and perforated items, especially in the form of printed circuit boards with drillings, which are taken through a treatment bath or to a processing station by conveyor means, in which there are means for reducing the metal-ion-depleted diffusion region in front of the surface of the items to be processed. For this purpose, in the presence of an anode and a cathodic item (K) or a cathode and an anodic item, the surface (K1) of the item to be treated is continuously mechanically wiped and the electrolyte is moved in a component substantially perpendicular to the plane of the item to be processed and taken through its drillings (42). The description also relates to an arrangement for implementing the process which contains means (W) for wiping the surfaces of the items to be treated and means to move the electrolyte through its drillings.
