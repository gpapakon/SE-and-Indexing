Guide wires (202, 203) are connected to the housing by the inner ends thereof and extend outwardly therefrom through the elongate tube means. The outer ends of the guide wires are connected to the flexible outer end portion of the elongate tube means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical catheters,
and more particularly to steerable catheters for
inserting into body vessels or cavities.Various commercially available catheters and
endoscopes exist for introducing into the body vessels
and cavities a variety of surgical tools, fluids, and
other materials, such as radiographic contrast
materials, angioplasty balloons, fiberoptic scopes,
laser lights, and cutting instruments. Also, various
techniques and systems have been developed for guiding
or steering the catheters in the body vessels and
cavities for use of these tools, fluids, and other
materials.Examples of such guiding or steering
techniques and systems for catheters may be seen in
U.S. Patent No. 4,983,165 to Loiterman entitled
"Guidance System For Vascular Catheter Or The Like,"
U.S. Patent No. 4,776,844 to Ueda entitled "Medical
Tube," U.S. Patent No. 4,934,340 to Ebling et al.
entitled "Device For Guiding Medical Catheters and
Scopes," U.S. Patent No. 4,930,521 to Metzger et al.
entitled "Variable Stiffness Esophageal Catheter," U.S.
Patent No. 3,470 to Barchilon entitled "Dirigible
Catheter," U.S. Patent No. 3,605,725 to Bentov entitled
"Controlled Motion Devices," and the Patent Cooperation 
Treaty ("PCT") Patent Application No. PCTWO88/00810 of
Tenerz et al. entitled "Guide For Mechanical Guiding Of
A Catheter In Connection With Cardio And Vessel
Examination." These catheters, however, failed to give
the physician or other operator sufficient control of
the distal end of the catheter and made it difficult to
manipulate the distal end for specific isolation on
particular sections of the body vessel or cavity.Some steerable catheters or systems have been
made to try to give the physician control of the use of
the catheter during surgical procedures wherein fluids
and the various tools are needed for the operation by
providing a flexible tube for controlling the direction
of movement of the distal end of the catheter.
Examples of these other attempts may be seen in the PCT
Patent Application No. PCTWO91/11213 of Lundquist et
al. entitled "Catheter Steering Mechanism," European
Patent Application No. 370,158 of Martin entitled
"Catheter For Prolonged Access," and U.S. Patent No.
4,737,142 to Heckele entitled "Instrument For
Examination And Treatment Of Bodily Passages." These
devices, however, still failed to provide the control
and manipulation of the catheter needed for use with
the surgical tools and fluids required for an
operation.Other attempts to control and manipulate the
catheter, such
