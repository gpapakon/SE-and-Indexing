<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical-fiber
amplifier which is to be used in a light communication
system and uses an optical fiber doped of a rare
earth element.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a
conventional optical-fiber amplifier of the type
described above, the amplifier being to be used for a
two-system signal line. In FIG. 1, reference numerals
1a, 1b designate first and second rare-earth-doped
optical fibers; 2a, 2b, first and second pumping
light sources; 3a, 3b, first and second multiwavelength
combining and dividing devices; 4a, 4b, first
and second pumping light source drive circuits; 5a,
5b, 5c, 5d, input and output terminals for signal
light; and 11a, 11b, first and second isolators.In operation, each of the first and second rare-earth-doped
optical fibers 1a, 1b is a single-mode
optical fiber doped of a rare earth element such as 
erbium (Er) and having a length of several meters to
several tens meters. The first wavelength division
multi/demultiplexing (WDM) device 3a is connected to
the first rare-earth-doped optical fiber 1a. The
wavelength division multi/demultiplexing (WDM)
devices may be optical couplers. The first and second
pumping light source 2a, 2b are semiconductor lasers
having a wavelength of, for example, 1.48 µm and are
driven the first and second pumping light source
drive circuits 4a, 4b, respectively. When several mW
to several tens mW of first pumping light outputted
from the first pumping light source 2a is inputted to
the first rare-earth-doped optical fiber 1a via the
first wavelength division multi/demultiplexing (WDM)
device 3a, the first rare-earth-doped optical fiber
1a assumes an inverted distribution state so that the
signal light having a wavelength of 1.53 or 1.55 µm
and inputted from the input and output terminal 5a
for the signal light is amplified by the action of
induced emission for output to the input and output
terminal 5b. Likewise, when the second pumping light
outputted from the second pumping light source 2b is
inputted to the second rare-earth-doped optical fiber
1b via the second wavelength division multi/demultiplexing
(WDM) device 3b, the second rare-earth-doped 
optical fiber 1b assumes a population inversion state
so that the signal light inputted from the input and
output terminal 5c is amplified for output to the
input and output terminal 5d. With this conventional
arrangement, it is impossible to improve the reliability
of this type optical-fiber light amplifier.The simplest popular optical-fiber amplifier for
a single-system
