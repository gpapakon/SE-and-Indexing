<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine with several screws, in which a plurality of conveying screws (3) meshing with one another and arranged in circular form around a working space are arranged in a fixed housing (barrel). For driving the conveying screws, there is provided a drive arrangement, which comprises a central gear wheel (7), gear wheels (8, 8') on the conveying screws and a hollow gear wheel on the inside wall of the housing. To be able to optimise the action of the gear wheels, it is proposed to arrange the gear wheels of neighbouring conveying screws axially offset with respect to one another.
