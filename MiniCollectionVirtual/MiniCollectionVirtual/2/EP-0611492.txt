<ABSTRACT>
An unearthed two-pin electric plug is provided. To avoid the need for tools when wiring, the plug includes a blade (2, 22, 62) rotating about the axis of a hinge which is parallel or perpendicular to the axis of the electric lead. In the two fullest embodiments of the plug, projections co-operate to split, position and connect up the lead. In one embodiment, the inner surface of the lower plug portion includes a base (80) with grooves (71, 72, 73) engaged by tapered splitting portions (51, 52, 53) which push the two conductors of the lead sideways so that they slide over the base (80) and are caught on contact spikes (5) at almost the same time as said lead is cut by the central blade (62). The lead is held in position by a filler bar (50) and by the splitting portions (51, 53) which drive the lead sideways so that it winds through recesses (81, 83).

Flat cable two-pin electric plug composed of two parts,one passive 
(12),the other active (11) connected by a hinge (1) ,said plug having needles 

(5) or contact spikes (4) designated to cross the conductive heart 
(102) of each wire (104) of the cable (103) ,comprising a cutting blade 

(2,22 or 62) which cutting edge is parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the cable when positionned,said cutting blade being embedded in one of the 

said parts of the plug and mainly acts as a separator of the two wires(104) 
of the cable (103) in a certain length. 
An electric plug as described in the claim 1,with the rotating axis 
of the hinge (1) joining the active (11) and the passive portion (12) paralell 

to the longitudinal axis of the cable (103) ,comprising male pins 
(13) diametrally split along the longitudinal median plane which contains 

a diameter of each of the pins (13),each of the two halves of each pin 
comprising a hollow half cylindrical aera embedded in the active portion 

(11) corresponding to one of the said halves of the said pin (13) ,or embedded 
in the passive portion (12) for the other of the said halves of the 

said male pin (13) ,the said hollow area (7) being used as a contact cavity 
for each wire of the cable ,the said hollow area (7) also including laterally 

a female pin (8) for one of the halves (11 or 12) of the plug or a male 
pin (9) for the other half, said pins (8 and 9) designated to fit into 

each other ,to act both as contact between the two halves of the pins (13) 
and as a pressure locking of the system. 
Electric plug as described in the claim 1,with the rotating axis of 
the hinge (1) joining the passive half (12) and the active one (11) of the 

plug ,parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cable (103) comprising female 
pin (7) diametrally split along the longitudinal median plane which 

contains a diameter of each of the said pins (7),each of the halves of the 
females pins (7) including laterally an area (16) with rear female parts 

(8) on one of the halves (11 or 12) of the plug and rear male parts (9) 
on the other half of the plug designated to fit into each other,to both act 

as good contact between the two halves of the pins (7) and as a pressure 
locking of the system.  

 
Electric plug as described in the claim 1 with the axis of the hinge 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the placed cable (103),comprising 

in its active part (11),also called the pressing block,beside the 
blade (22) a two slopes roof-shaped scraper (35) with lower edges (25) 

fixing the limits of the leading grooves designated to drive and to maintain 
the wires (104) of the cable (103) ,after the cutting of the said 

cable in contact with the passive half (12) or more precisely in their 
contact site (24) ,after having made them slide over the sliding planes 

(23) on which fits the scraper (35) ,the said passive half (12) also comprises 
a wedging edge (20) and a stabilizing tip (40) for the cable (103) 

where the said cable lays before the cutting operation. 
An electrical plug as described in claim 1,with the axis of its 
hinge (1) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the placed cable , 

comprising on the inner surface of the active part (11),beside the blade 
(62), a filler bar (50) which rear part is triangular shaped,at least 

three splitting portions (51,52,53) which profile is cone shaped,ending 
splitting portions (51,53) whose maximum width is greater than that of 

the filler bar (50) ,also act as a locking device of the wires (104) 
that wind through side grooves (81,83) corresponding to the splitting portions 

(51,53) ,a front and rear endings of the blade (62) protruding the 
front and rear endings of the filler bar (50);the inner surface of the 

passive part (12) comprising a base (80) parallel to the longitudinal 
median plane, the wires (104) of the cable (103) sliding on the said base 

(80) during the shutting down of the plug,the said wires (104) getting 
pierced by the contact spikes (4) arranged laterally,the said inner surface 

comprising also projections called receiving slots (71,72,73) for 
the splitting portions (51,52,53 respectively),a channel (56) and a stabilizing 

tip (40) into whose the cable (103) is set before the cutting operation.
