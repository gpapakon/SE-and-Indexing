<ABSTRACT>
A grinder (10) for dry waste materials includes 
a vertically-oriented, cylindrically-shaped housing 

having an opening at its upper end for receiving 
materials to be comminuted. The shredder element (25) 

has upwardly-extending impeller blades (32,34) disposed on 
its upper surface. The outer perimeter of the 

shredder element is separated from the inner wall of 
the housing sufficiently to provide a gap (21) through 

which comminuted materials can drop from the upper 
chamber (16) to the lower chamber (19) of the housing. The 

interior of the upper portion of the housing is 
provided around its circumference with diverger 

blades (28) that are angled downwardly in the direction 
of rotation of the shredder element. The lower 

housing has a closed bottom and a tangentially 
oriented discharge element (18) for discharge from the 

lower housing (19) of comminuted materials. The shredder 
element (25) has downwardly-extending paddles (38) on its 

lower surface that extend downwardly into the lower 
housing (19) and are adapted to sweep the lower housing, 

act as an air blower and expel comminuted materials 
therefrom. Optionally the shredder element is 

flattened on opposite sides, to provide enlarged 
openings (31) for movement of comminuted materials from 

the upper chamber into the lower chamber. The 
upwardly-extending impeller blades may optionally be 

Z-shaped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
grinding waste materials. More specifically, the 
invention relates to waste grinders for materials 
such as foods, medical waste, or other materials 
such as foam plastics that can be ground or 
comminuted and then disposed of without the need of 
washing the ground materials away by means of a 
supply of flushing water. Food waste disposers in sinks and other 
types of waste grinding devices are commonly used 
with a supply of flushing water that transports the 
ground material through a drainage pipe into a waste 
disposal system. Because of clogging problems, such 
disposers have generally not been operated without 
water. However, many wastes can more efficiently be 
recovered, recycled, or disposed of if they are 
maintained in a dry state. For example, in the case 
of food waste converted to use as animal feed, it is 
desirable to eliminate the need for energy consuming 
drying processes. A need has, thus, existed for 
devices that are capable of conserving water and 
providing a disposal means that results in a dry  
 
waste material that does not have to be flushed through a 
sanitary waste treatment system. The present invention has as its principal object 
the provision of a workable dry waste grinder. According to the invention there is provided a 
grinder for dry waste materials comprising a vertically-oriented, 
cylindrically-shaped housing having an opening at 
its upper end for receiving materials to be comminuted, 
said housing being divided into upper and lower chambers by 
means of a rotatable, disk-shaped shredder element, said 
shredder element having upwardly-extending impeller blades 
disposed on its upper surface, the outer perimeter of said 
shredder element being separated from the inner wall of 
said housing sufficiently to provide a gap through which 
comminuted materials can drop into said lower housing, 
diverter blades uniformly spaced around the inner perimeter 
of said upper portion of said housing and being angled 
downwardly in the direction of rotation of said disk-shaped 
shredder element, said lower housing having a closed bottom 
and a tangentially-oriented discharge outlet for discharge 
therefrom of comminuted materials, said shredder element 
having downwardly extending blades on its lower surface, 
said blades having an area adapted to sweep said lower 
housing and expel comminuted materials therefrom outwardly 
through said tangential opening, said shredder element 
being connected by a central shaft to a means to

angled downwardly in the direction of rotation of said 
disk-shaped shredder element, said lower housing having a 

closed bottom and a tangentially-oriented discharge outlet 
for discharge therefrom of comminuted materials, said 

shredder element having downwardly extending blades on its 
lower surface, said blades having an area adapted to sweep 

said lower housing and expel comminuted materials therefrom 
outwardly through said tangential opening, said shredder 

element being connected by a central shaft to a means to 
rotate said element. 
A grinder according to claim 1 wherein said upwardly-extending 
impeller blades are provided with upper edges 

extending forwardly in the direction of rotation. 
A grinder according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
paddles on the bottom of said rotatable shredder element 

occupy a sufficient portion of the cross-section of said 
lower housing so that upon rotation they act as a blower 

capable of moving air out of the discharge opening and 
drawing air down through the inlet into the disposer. 
A grinder according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said 
shredder element is flattened on at least one side to 

provide an enlarged opening for movement of comminuted 
materials into said lower chamber. 
A grinder according to claim 4 wherein the enlarged 
area comprises a flat area located at the point where an 

upwardly-extending blade intersects the circumference of 
the rotating shredder. 
A grinder according to claim 5 wherein said blade 
extends outwardly and overhangs the edge of said flat area. 
A grinder according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
wherein said impeller blades are Z-shaped such as Z-shaped 

brackets. 
A grinder according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said shredder element is further provided 

with a plurality of openings to permit flow of air and 
finely divided particles to flow from said upper chamber to 

said lower chamber.
