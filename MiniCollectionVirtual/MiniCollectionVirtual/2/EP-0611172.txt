<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to devices for preparing a solution by dissolving at least one substance in a liquid. The device according to the invention is essentially characterised in that it includes a circuit 1, for a liquid 2, comprising a pipe 3, a cartridge 4 of the substance 5 for delivering a solution and a pipe 9, a circuit 11 for the liquid 2, a circuit 14 which is connected to the two circuits 1 and 11, means 20 for controlling the flow of the liquid in one of the circuits 1 and 11, means 30 for measuring the composition of the solution in the pipe 9 and delivering a first signal, means 40 for measuring the fluid flow rate in the circuit 1 and delivering a second signal, means 50 for measuring the fluid flow rate in the circuit 11 and delivering a third signal, and a processing element 60 which controls the means 20 as a function of these three signals. Application: especially for treatments such as haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration and haemofiltration.
