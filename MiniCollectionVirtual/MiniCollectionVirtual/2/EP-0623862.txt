<ABSTRACT>
A system controller (32) provides hierarchial control of a 
plurality of discrete chiller units (10, 12, 14) each 

having individual dedicated controls (26, 28, 30). The 
system controller (32) imposes limits on the amount of 

compression that can be demanded by the individual 
dedicated controls (26, 28, 30). These limits are 

selectively changed in response to whether a level of 
chilling has been collectively achieved. The selective 

changing of these limits may be premised on examinations 
of each individual chiller unit (10, 12, 14) including the 

recent history of any changes in compression by the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the simultaneous control of
several individual chiller units within a system that is
processing chilled coolant via common supply and return
lines. In particular, this invention relates to the
control of a number of different chiller units each having
their own respective dedicated control units.Multiple chillers on a common coolant loop are subjected
to the same entering coolant temperature at approximately
the same time. The chillers are typically required to
maintain the leaving coolant at the same temperature.
This causes the individual units to simultaneously start
or stop their compressors at the same time. This leads to
unnecessary and at times excessive demands on electrical
power consumption and excessive compressor cycling in
order to provide the chilling of the coolant perceived to
be necessary. In this regard, each individual chiller
unit having its own particular compressor stages and
control unit is trying to activate the perceived number of
compressor stages necessary to achieve the desired
chilling without regard to what may be happening
elsewhere. This often produces an over reaction.EP-A-0204521 discloses a system in which a controller
issues a load signal to a heating/cooling source to
instruct it positively to load (or unload) a compressor
stage, and in which the sources are brought on-line one at
a time, the controller sending a load signal to a first
source to successively load the stages of that source
until the source reaches full load, and then sending a
load signal to a second source after the first source is
fully loaded. US-A-4483152 discloses a system in which a controller
activates selected individual compressor stages from any
of the chillers of the system in accordance with a
database of detected efficiencies.The present invention aims to provide a hierarchial
control system which allows individually controlled units
to provide normal control functions while at the same time
supervising reaction by the individual chiller units to
maintain the leaving coolant temperature at some
predefined level.The present invention provides a process in accordance
with claim 1. The process imposes demand limits on
individual chiller control units whereby the individual
units cannot simply activate or deactivate compressor
stages. In the event that the capacity demands 
placed on the individual units need to be exceeded, the
overall control system selects which individual units are
to receive changes in demand limits so as to thereby
increase or decrease the
