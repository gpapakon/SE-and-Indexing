<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of a solid catalytic component of a catalyst of Ziegler-Natta type, 

comprising contacting (i) at least one compound (A) of a transition 
metal (TM) with (ii) a solid product (B) comprising a magnesium 

compound and having a reducing power for the transition metal (TM), 
in the presence of (iii) at least one olefin under conditions such 

that the olefin at least partially polymerizes during the 
contacting. The solid catalytic component is particularly useful 

for producing ethylene (co-)polymers in a gas phase process and for 
improving the statistical distribution of the comonomer in the 

copolymer structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of a catalyst of Ziegler-Natta type, and to a process for the 
(co)polymerization of olefins using the catalyst. It is known that a catalyst of Ziegler-Natta type is composed 
of a solid catalytic component containing a compound of a transition 
metal, such as titanium or vanadium, and generally a magnesium 
compound, and a cocatalytic component based on an organometallic 
compound of a metal belonging to Groups I to III of the Periodic 
Classification of the Elements. It is also known to use such a catalyst in a process for the 
(co)polymerization of olefins, in particular for the 
copolymerization of ethylene with at least one other olefin 
containing at least three carbon atoms, in suspension in a liquid 
hydrocarbon or in the gaseous phase, at a temperature less than the 
melting point of the (co)polymer. The copolymer generally has a 
macromolecular structure in which the comonomer unit is distributed 
with relatively low homogeneity or not in a very statistical 
fashion. It results therefrom that, for a given density and a given 
weight-average molecular mass, the copolymer has both a relatively 
high comonomer content and a relatively high melting point. A 
distribution of relatively low homogeneity of the comonomer unit 
also has the effect of weakening certain mechanical properties of 
the films prepared from such a copolymer and of increasing the 
levels of solubles, for example in boiling n-hexane. In European Patent Application EP-A-0,099,774, there is  
 
proposed a post-treatment of the solid catalytic component 
containing a transition metal and a magnesium compound using an 
olefin such as ethylene. In this case, the olefin is not used during 
the preparation of the solid catalytic component. US Patent US-P-4,442,225 discloses a method for preparing a 
solid catalytic component of a Ziegler-type catalyst comprising 
reacting (i) an organomagnesium compound or a mixture of an 
organomagnesium compound and an organoaluminium compound or their 
reaction product with (ii) a mixture of a halogenating agent and a 
titanium compound, in the presence of (iii) an electron-donor 
compound and (iv) an alpha-olefin. However, the organomagnesium 
compound or the mixture or the reaction product is used in s state 
of solution for preparing a solid catalytic component of highly 
uniform particle diameter, of good fluidity, not readily 
disintegrating, suitable for olefin polymerization having a high 
degree of polymerizing activity, high
