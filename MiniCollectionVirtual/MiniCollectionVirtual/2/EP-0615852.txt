<ABSTRACT>
A method of tinting an unhydrated contact lens (26) involves the 
steps of providing an unhydrated contact lens (26); providing a dyestuff 

solution; providing a printing block (14) comprising a hydrophilic 
polymer material containing a dye complexing agent capable of 

noncovalently bonding the dyestuff; placing the dyestuff solution onto 
the printing block; contacting the unhydrated contact lens and the 

printing block for a time sufficient to allow the dyestuff solution to 
diffuse to the lens; and removing the lens from the printing block.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to contact lenses and to a method for their preparation. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a method of applying tint or other dyestuff to a 
hydrophilic contact lens while the lens is in its xerogel, or "dry," state. Tinted or otherwise dyed contact lenses are used as means for cosmetically altering eye 
color, as well as for providing means for aiding in the visualization of the lens itself. A 
problem exists, however, in that many of the known methods for tinting or otherwise 
dying plastic materials are unsuitable for practical coloring of hydrophilic (commonly 
referred to as "soft") contact lenses. For example, the blending of dye into the lens 
material is not useful because the presence of water in the hydrophilic polymer encourages 
migration and leaching of the dye through and out of the lens body. Therefore, it has 
become desirable in the industry to utilize a method which involves placing the dye on an 
outer surface of an otherwise standard, clear ("untinted") lens. A number of techniques have been used to place colorant on the outside surface of a clear 
lens. One approach has been the use of printing, transfer or coating methods. According to 
this process, a coloring agent is caused to adhere to the surface of the plastic lens. 
However, this process is not well suited for coloring water-absorbable materials as used in 
soft contact lenses. First, there exists a tendency for the dye to form blotches towards the 
center of the lens, particularly in the area of the lens corresponding to the pupil of the 
wearer. Also, if a dry hydrophilic lens colored by this method is allowed to swell in water, 
the applied layer of coloring agent does not swell as much as the plastic itself. 
Consequently, the coloring agent will become dissociated from the surface of the lens, 
thereby creating deformation and cosmetic defects in the product. One method of 
overcoming this problem has been to use standard dot matrix printing techniques, thereby 
allowing spaces between the dots which allow for swelling of the lens. However, while 
such method may allow printing on a dry lens, the resulting product does not have a solid 
covering of tint and is therefore artificial looking.  
 One method of tinting an unhydrated hydrophilic contact lens is described in 
US-A-4,668,240, and particularly in column 10, lines 26 to 30 thereof. According to this 
method, an annular pattern is printed onto the lens and the lenses are subsequently dried 
under vacuum and then cured. A method

<CLAIMS>
A method of tinting an unhydrated contact lens, comprising the steps of: 

a) providing an unhydrated contact lens comprising a material capable of fixing a dyestuff 
having diffused into the lens; 
b) providing a dyestuff solution; 
c) providing a printing block comprising a hydrophilic polymer material containing a dye 
complexing agent capable of noncovalently bonding the dyestuff; 
d) placing the dyestuff solution onto the printing block; 
e) contacting the unhydrated contact lens and the printing block for a time sufficient to 
allow the dyestuff solution to diffuse to the lens; and 
f) removing the lens from the printing block. 
The method of claim 1, and further comprising removing excess dyestuff solution from 
the printing block prior to contacting the the printing block and the lens. 
The method of claim 1, and further comprising the step of, prior to contacting the 
printing block and lens, first hydrating the printing block in buffered saline and then 

placing the printing block in the dyestuff solution for a sufficient time to allow the tinting 
solution to equilibriate in the pad. 
The method of claim 1, and further comprising the step of placing the lens containing 
the dyestuff in an activating solution to cause the dyestuff to attach to the lens. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the lens comprises a hydrophilic polymer material 
containing a dye complexing agent capable of noncovalently bonding the dyestuff.
