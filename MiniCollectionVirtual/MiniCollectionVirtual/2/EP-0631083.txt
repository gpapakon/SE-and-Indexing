<ABSTRACT>
There are described a coupling (11) having the bullet-shaped 
projections (13) on a cylindrical holding portion (12) for preventing a hose 

from coming off from the holding portion (12) and a method of 
manufacturing the same. The coupling (11) is capable of preventing the 

hose from being broken by the projections (13) thereof by rounding the end 
edges (13b) of the projections (13), which leads to stability of the coupling 

(11) for a long time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to couplings and a method of 
manufacturing the same with which elastic deformable hoses such as a 
rubber hose, synthetic resin hose, etc. engage, more particularly to the 
structures of the couplings and the method of manufacturing the 
couplings capable of surely preventing the hose from coming off from the 
coupling and capable of preventing the same hose from being broken. A prior art tube such as a water hose or gas hose comprises a 
metallic coupling, a hose which engages with the metallic coupling and a 
fastening ring which fastens the periphery of the hose to thereby prevent 
the hose from coming off from the coupling. However, such a prior art tube using the fastening ring can not 
completely prevent the hose from coming off from the coupling, depending 
on pressure applied to the hose. To improve the above drawback, the present applicant has proposed 
a coupling which is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 3-134396 and is illustrated in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, three bullet-shaped projections 3 project in equal intervals 
from the outer periphery of a cylindrical holding portion 2 of a coupling 1 
and a hose 4 formed of an elastic deformable material engages with the 
holding portion 2. Each of the projections 3 has a projection wall 3a. A 
fastening ring 5 is wound around the outer periphery of the hose 4 to 
fasten the hose 4. With such an arrangement, the hose 4 is hard to come off from the 
coupling 1 since the fastening ring 5 hits against each projection 3.  However, it has revealed that the following problems are liable to 
occur in the prior art tube described above. That is, since each end edge 3b of the projecting wall 3a is pointed, 
there was such a drawback that the end edge 3b broke the hose 4 as 
denoted at the breakage 4a from which liquid leaks during long use of the 
hose. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide 
couplings (hereinafter referred to simply as a coupling) capable of 
improving the prior art coupling and also capable of preventing a hose 
from being broken and a method of manufacturing the same. To achieve the above object, it is a first aspect of the invention to provide 
a coupling comprising a cylindrical holding portion with which an elastic 
deformable hose engages, a plurality of bullet-shaped projections which 
project from the outer periphery of the holding portion for preventing the 
hose from coming off from the holding portion when the hose engages with 
the holding portion and a
