<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for integrating a submicron CMOS device (60) and a non-volatile memory (24), wherein a thermal oxide layer (36) is formed over a semiconductor substrate (20) and a two layered polysilicon non-volatile memory device (24) formed thereon. A portion (38) of the thermal oxide (36) is removed by etching, a thin gate oxide (40) and a third layer of polysilicon (46) having a submicron depth is deposited onto the etched region (38). The layer of polysilicon (46) is used as the gate for the submicron CMOS device (60). In so doing a submicron CMOS device may be formed without subjecting the device to the significant re-oxidation required in formation processes for dual poly non-volatile memory devices such as EPROMs and EEPROMs, and separate device optimization is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to semiconductor
devices. Specifically, the present invention pertains
to the integration of submicron CMOS devices with
non-volatile memory devices.Erasable programmable read only memories, known
as EPROMs, and electrically erasable programmable read
only memories, known as EEPROMs, are well known "floating
gate" devices of the art. Typically, these double layer
polysilicon non-volatile memory devices are programmed
and accessed using a separate device which is electrically
coupled to the memory device. In the past, such programming
and accessing has been accomplished using a
transistor formed during the formation of the memory device.
That is, the formation of the transistor was incorporated
into the manufacturing process flow of the
memory device. Specifically, as the second layer of
polysilicon was deposited to form the memory cell, the
polysilicon was also deposited onto a separate region of
the substrate. A transistor was then formed in that
separate region having the second layer of polysilicon as
one of the gates of the device. Incorporating the formation
of the transistor into the manufacturing process
flow was considered to be advantageous in that it simplified
the manufacturing processes required in the formation
of the devices.Accessing the floating gate device using a high
performance submicron CMOS transistor would be especially
beneficial due to the high speed at which the submicron
CMOS device operates. However, several incompatibilities 
exist which inhibit integrating the formation of submicron
CMOS devices, such as high performance N-channel and
P-channel transistors, with the manufacturing processes
used to form double layer polysilicon non-volatile memory
devices such as EPROMs and EEPROMs.Floating gate devices, such as EPROMs and EEPROMs,
require significant oxidation after the deposition
of each of the polysilicon layers forming these devices.
Multiple poly re-oxidations are necessary to achieve adequate
charge retention characteristics. Unfortunately,
submicron CMOS devices experience significant transconductance
and reliability degradation when exposed to excessive
poly re-oxidation. As a result, performance of
submicron CMOS devices exposed to dual-poly formation
processes is prohibitively reduced. Specifically, as
submicron polysilicon gates are exposed to repeated oxidation,
the edges of the gates tend to lift from the substrate
due to oxidation of the gate edges. This decouples
the gate from the channel region. As a result, gain
degradation and
