<ABSTRACT>
There is described a method for recovering symbol synchronism 
useable in the demodulators MPSK or QAM. In accordance with the 

method in question there is used a VCO inserted in a PLL for 
sampling the symbols at the double-frequency of the symbol 

frequency and for generating the symbol reading clock. The 
algebraic sum with alternating sign of the absolute value of four 

consecutive samples constitutes a generic term of an error sequence 
which, appropriately filtered, controls the VCO. The central 

values of the symbols at the reading instants are obtained by 
interpolating the respective samples. A hangup of the PLL is 

revealed by the sign discordance between samples taken in pairs. 
In case of detection, the sequential order of the interpolated 

samples is changed and the symbol reading clock phase inverted. 
The sign of the error sequence controlling the VCO is also inverted 

in order to stabilise the equilibrium point of the PLL.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of numerical 
transmissions and specifically concerns a method for symbol 
synchronism recovery in digitally modulated signal receivers and the 
circuit derived therefrom. As is known to correctly read sequentially transmitted symbols 
generally present downstream of a demodulator in the form of 
appropriately shaped pulses, it is necessary to read the amplitude of 
said pulses opposite the maximum value coinciding with the value at 
the central point. This assumes the use of a reading clock signal 
having the same cadence as the symbols, whose reading edge coincides 
with the instant corresponding to the central value of the symbol. 
Local generation of a signal having the above characteristics is 
rather problematical, especially because of an unavoidable if small 
frequency error between the signal generated locally in relation to 
that used in transmission. It is therefore necessary to provide 
appropriate synchronisation making use of the information contained 
in or obtainable from the data received. A method widely used today for obtaining said synchronisation is 
that of using a phase locked loop (PLL). The same method is also 
used in demodulators for digitally modulated signals, MPSK, QAM, 
etc., for recovery of the demodulation carrier. As concerns circuit architecture of a PLL, it has long been 
known but it may be useful to recall that a PLL comprises essentially 
a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a phase comparator supplying a 
measurement of phase shift, or phase error ε, between a reference 
signal and a clock signal generated by the VCO, an amplifier and 
lastly a loop filter of the low-pass type. The loop filter extracts 
from the signal emerging from the phase comparator the nearly 
continuous component. The latter is a function V(ε) which when 
appropriately amplified controls in negative feedback the VCO. The 
PLL first links in frequency and then in phase to the reference 
signal, supplying at output a 'clean' clock signal. As known, the digital modulation of a carrier by a modulating  
 
signal whose amplitude varies in a pseudo-causal manner in time, as 
takes place for example in vocal and television etc. signals, 
produces a modulated signal in which the symbol synchronism 
information is not contained directly. It is therefore necessary to 
operate an appropriate symbol distortion in reception, e.g. using a 
'quadrator' or rectifier in order to obtain the above reference 
signal for the phase comparator. Examples of symbol, or
