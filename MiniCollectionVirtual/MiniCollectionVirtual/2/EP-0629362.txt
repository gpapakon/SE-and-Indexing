<ABSTRACT>
A buckle is comprised of a male coupling member (10) 
attached to one article (1) and a female coupling member (12) 

attached to another article (2). The male coupling member (10) 
includes an article-attaching frame (12) having a pair of side bars 

(15, 15), an article-attaching bar (14) joined at their opposed 
ends to the respective upper ends of the side bars (15, 15) and a 

proximal bar (16) joined at its opposed ends to the respective 
lower ends so as to rotate on its own axis and a locking member 

(13) including a joint portion (20) integrally mounted on the 
upper end of the locking member (13) and mounted on the 

proximal bar (16) so as to rotate on the axis of the locking 
member (13) which is substantially normal to the axis of the 

proximal bar (16). The female coupling member (12) includes a 
housing body (33) and an article-attaching portion (34, 58) 

provided on the housing body (33) and attached to the other 
article (2); and means (31, 36) for locking the locking bar (13b) 

into the housing body (33) so as to rotate on the housing body 
(33) around the axis which is perpendicular to the plane of the 

buckle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a buckle used with 
belts, garments, baggage's etc., and more particularly to a buckle 
comprising a pair of male and female coupling members, the male 
coupling member attached to one part of such an article and the 
female coupling member attached to another part so that the 
coupling of the male and female coupling members connects 
both parts to each other. A typical example of a buckle described above is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 5-91905. The 
disclosed plastic buckle is comprised of a pair of male and female 
coupling members, the male coupling member being insertable 
into the female coupling member. The female coupling member 
is composed of a pair of parallel spaced upper and lower plates 
defining there between a chamber. The upper plate has a 
circular through aperture formed there through. The lower plate 
has its central area cut away to provide a resilient engaging 
tongue. The resilient engaging tongue extends from the lower 
plate and normally projects inside the chamber. The male 
coupling member is comprised of a peripheral body having a 
central hole and a substantially circular button extending from 
the peripheral body so as to substantially fill up the central hole. 
The peripheral body has a locking step formed on the distal end 
thereof. When the male coupling member is inserted into the 
female coupling member, the locking step of the male coupling 
member comes into locking engagement with the tip of the 
locking tongue, and the circular button, under its own bias, comes  
 
into locking engagement with the circular aperture. To uncouple 
the male coupling member from the female coupling member, the 
circular button exposed in the circular aperture is simply 
depressed. The circular button, in turn, presses down the 
resilient engaging tongue against its resiliency, thereby bringing 
the resilient engaging tongue out of locking engagement with the 
locking step of the male coupling member. Now that the locking 
step of the male coupling member comes out of locking 
engagement with the resilient engaging tongue of the female 
member, the male coupling member can be pulled out of the 
chamber of the female coupling member. Another example of a buckle of this type is disclosed in 
Japanese Design Registration No. 794905. This conventional 
buckle, likewise, is comprised of a male coupling member and a 
female coupling member for coupling engagement with the male 
coupling member. The male coupling member is
