<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substrates for printed circuit boards
and, more particularly, to materials which may be used as printed circuit
board substrates and methods for using such substrates in the fabrication
of printed circuits.Printed circuits have long ago replaced wire circuits in the vast
preponderance of applications. A printed circuit makes it possible to
economically and reliably produce many copies of highly complicated
circuits, which take up relatively little space.To produce a printed circuit, a thin sheet of conductive metal,
typically copper or aluminum, is made to adhere to one or more faces of
a substrate. The substrate is typically in the form of a sheet of appropriate
thickness and mechanical properties used to preserve the shape of the
conductive layer and give the structure strength. The conductive layer is
subsequently exposed to a printing process which imprints onto the
conductor surface the precise image of the circuit design. Etching
techniques are then used to remove certain portions of the conductor layer
so as to leave the precise circuit desired.The choice of substrate is of great importance since its electrical
properties significantly affect the performance and efficiency of the circuit,
especially at high frequencies. This will be increasingly the case in the
future as faster logics, such as higher switching frequencies and denser 
conductive patterns, will increasingly require a substrate of low dielectric
constant and low dissipation losses.A variety of substrates are in current use, among them glass epoxy,
tetrafluoroethylene or Teflon® and Duroid®.While such substrate provide adequate mechanical properties, their
electrical properties leave something to be desired. Specifically, these
substrates have dielectric constants and dissipation factors which in certain
applications be sufficiently high to adversely affect the performance and
efficiency of the printed circuit. In addition, these substrates are relatively
costly and of relatively high density, thereby raising both the cost and the
weight of the finished printed circuits.There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly
desirable to have, printed circuit boards substrate which have significantly
lower dielectric constants and dissipation factors than those of commonly
used substrates and which, in addition, is less costly and of lower density.A printed circuit
board comprising a foamed polyethylene substrate having a dielectric constant less than
1.5 is known from US-A-4 937
