<ABSTRACT>
A head-track orienting system for use in magnetic 
recording tape drives is disclosed which automatically 

corrects for misalignment between the head assembly (26) and a 
recorded servo track (31) on the tape. Using a servo control 

loop, the system calculates head-track alignment error 
during operation of the tape drive and either pivots the 

head assembly (26) or adjusts the tape cartridge to compensate 
for the error. Transverse head-track positioning 

mechanisms are also included in the system to locate and 
maintain a centered position of the heads (25, 27) on the 

servo track.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic recording
tape drives, and more particularly to a system for
correcting alignment errors between a head of a magnetic
recording system and a track on a magnetic recording
tape.Conventional head assemblies for magnetic tape
drives comprise separate heads for recording (writing)
and playback (reading). Many assemblies employ a
combination of write and read heads for a given channel
arranged so that all of the heads can be aligned with a
selected track on a magnetic recording tape. For
example, a "read write read" head assembly may have three
heads positioned along a common line so that a write head
is positioned between two read heads. This configuration
allows the head assembly to perform a "read after write"
operation in which the read head following the write head
verifies the integrity of the just-written data for
either a forward or reverse direction of tape travel.In state of the art high areal density recording,
track pitch is extremely small. If either the head or
the tape is even slightly misaligned with respect to the
reference plane of the tape drive, the read head may pick
up only a partial signal from the just-written track, or
may even begin reading the signal from the next adjacent
track. This off-track position may give rise to a very
large perceived error rate during a read after write
operation even if the actual recording was error-free.Head-track misalignment has been previously
addressed in a number of ways. For instance, mechanical
tolerances on data cartridge construction may be
tightened and initial alignment of the head/actuator
assembly may be finely adjusted. With the advent of high 
density magnetic tapes, however, track widths have
decreased to the point where incorporating the necessary
mechanical precision into every drive and every cartridge
becomes impractical and prohibitively expensive. Even
when the cartridge and drive are manufactured according
to close specifications, head-track misalignment may
still occur. For example, error may result from the
biasing or skewing of tape which travels at high speeds
under tension in a data cartridge. This type of error is
especially apparent when a new track is written on the
tape or data is overwritten onto an existing track. When
the existing track was created by a different drive from
the one in use, the opportunity for error is even
greater.Though improper tape alignment with respect to the
reference plane is, in theory, a separate circumstance
from improper head alignment, in practice
