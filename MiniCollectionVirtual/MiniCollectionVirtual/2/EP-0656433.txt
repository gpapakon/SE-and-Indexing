<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle plate for spinning has a 
plurality of spinning holes (4), each spinning hole (4) 

comprising a fluid-introducing portion (8) and a fluid-discharging 
portion (10) having a small inner diameter from 

which molten fluid sent from the fluid-introducing portion (8) 
is discharged. At least a part of the inner surface of each 

spinning hole (4), which is connected to an entrance (10a) of 
the fluid-discharging portion (10), is formed as a three-dimensional 

smoothly curved surface (9) so that a form line of 
the entrance (10a) of the fluid-discharging portion (10) 

substantially does not appear. A portion causing residence of 
the molten fluid can be removed, thereby achieving an extremely 

smooth flow, and the pressure loss can be considerably suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nozzle plate for
spinning, and more specifically to a nozzle plate for spinning
which can prevent residence of fluid in the nozzle plate and
reduce pressure loss due to the the nozzle plate.Usually, a nozzle plate for spinning is manufactured by
providing a number of spinning holes formed as a predetermined
shape to a disc member made of a steel, particularly, a
stainless steel. In a case where the cross section of a spun
yarn is formed as a circular cross section, the spinning hole is
formed, for example, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. In a case
where it is formed as a modified cross section (cross section
other than a circular cross section, for example, Y-shape, star-shape,
cross-shape and triangular-shape sections), the spinning
hole is formed, for example, as shown in FIGS. 16 and 17.FIG. 14 or 16 shows a part of the vertical section of a
disc member 101 or 111 constituting a nozzle plate for spinning,
and a predetermined number of spinning holes 102 or 112 are
formed in the disc member 101 or 111. The arrows indicate the
flow direction of a molten fluid, for example, a molten synthetic
resin. Each of the spinning holes 102 or 112 comprises a
fluid-introducing opening 103 or 113 whose cross section is
formed as a circular cross section and whose inner surface is
formed as a tapered surface, a fluid-introducing portion 104 or 
114 formed as a right-cylindrical hole whose cross section is formed as a
circular cross section, a contracting portion 105 or 115 whose
cross section is formed as a circular cross section and whose
inner surface is formed as a tapered surface, and a fluid-discharging
portion 106 or 116 having a constant radial
cross-sectional shape along the axial
direction thereof. For use in spinning a circular cross-section
yarn, the cross section of the fluid-discharging portion
106 is formed with a circular section as shown in FIG. 15, and for use in
spinning a modified cross-section yarn, the cross section of the
fluid-discharging portion 116 is formed with, for example, a Y-shape
cross section as shown in FIG. 17.An extremely high finishing accuracy is required
for processing the fluid-discharging portion 106 or 116 in the
spinning hole 102 or 112 and additionally the hole diameter (the
maximum hole diameter) must be processed to a small diameter in
the range of about 0.1 to 1.0 mm. In particular, in the case
of a nozzle plate for a modified cross-section yarn,
the cross section of the hole portion must be formed as a
modified cross section. Because of

A nozzle plate (1) for spinning having a plurality of
spinning holes (4), each of the said spinning holes (4)

comprising a fluid-introducing portion (8) into which a
molten fluid is to be introduced and a fluid-discharging

portion (10) from which the said molten fluid flowing from
the said fluid-introducing portion (8) is to be discharged;

which fluid-discharging portion (10) has a non-circular
cross-section which is smaller in area than that of the

fluid-introducing portion (8), characterized in that the
said plurality of spinning holes (4) are defined by

respective ceramic members (5) fixed in respective
attachment holes (3) in a nozzle body (2) of the nozzle

plate (1) and the part (9) of the inner surface of
each of the said spinning holes (4), which part (9) (as

viewed in the flow direction of the said molten fluid)
leads from an exit of the said fluid-introducing portion to

an entrance of the said fluid-discharging portion, is
formed as a smooth three-dimensional curved surface indicating

substantially no form line of the said exit of the fluid-introducing
portion or of the said entrance of the said

fluid-discharging portion.

cross section has a portion (19b) extending in the

radial direction of the said fluid-discharging portion
(10), which portion (19b) has a width (W1 or W2) which

varies within a region (B or C) of the said portion (19b)
extending radially of the said fluid-discharging portion 

(10).
