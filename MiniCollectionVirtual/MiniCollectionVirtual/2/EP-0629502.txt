<ABSTRACT>
An inkjet recording apparatus comprises an inkjet head 
having formed in a p-type or n-type semiconductor substrate 

(1) at least one nozzle (4), an ink supply passage (6, 7) 
connected to the nozzle and a diaphragm (5) contiguous to the 

ink supply passage, and further having electrostatic actuator 
means for driving the diaphragm such that in response to a 

diaphragm motion ink droplets are ejected from the nozzle, 
said electrostatic actuator means comprising a first electrode 

(17) attached to the substrate, said diaphragm (5) and 
a second electrode (21) disposed opposite to said diaphragm 

with a gap (G) therebetween; and drive circuit means (102) 
for selectively applying a drive voltage between said first 

and second electrodes (17, 21), wherein the polarity of said 
drive voltage is selected such that in case of a p-type substrate 

said first electrode is made positive with respect to 

the second electrodes, while in case of an n-type substrate 
said first electrode is made negative with respect to the 

second electrodes. For ejecting an ink droplet from the 
nozzle the electrostatic actuator is first charged and then 

discharged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus
having a so-called ink-on-demand type inkjet head which
ejects ink droplets only when respective dots are actually to
be recorded on a recording medium. More specifically, the
invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus having an
electrostatically driven inkjet head.Mainly two kinds of ink-on-demand type inkjet heads are
currently used differing in the way of generating the pressure
required for ink ejection. One kind uses piezoelectric
actuators for this purpose as disclosed in, e.g., DE-A-31 47
107 and EP-A-0 337 429, while the other employs heating
elements for heating ink so as to generate bubbles as described
in, e.g., JP-B-59911/1986. Each of these two kinds of
inkjet head has its own merits and demerits. While the former
type suffers from problems in manufacturing when a certain
nozzle density and precision is required, it enjoys a high
reliability and a long service life. On the other hand, the
bubble type inkjet head presents less manufacturing problems
but its resistive heating elements tend to become damaged
over time as a result of the repeated rapid heating and
cooling and the impacts caused by collapsing bubbles, and so
the practical service life of the inkjet head is accordingly
short. Thus, none of these two kinds of inkjet heads is
really fully satisfactory.A third known principle for pressure generation in an inkjet
head makes use of an electrostatic force, i.e., employs an
electrostatic actuator as disclosed in JP-A-289351/1990 and
US-A-4,520,375. More particularly, JP-A-289351/1990 discloses an inkjet head comprising a silicon substrate
having formed therein ink passages each connected to a respective nozzle at one end and to a
common ink reservoir at the other end. A side wall portion of the ink passage is formed by a
diaphragm as a vibration plate. A respective individual or nozzle electrode is provided on the
outside surface of each diaphragm. Disposed opposite the nozzle electrodes, via a gap, is a
common electrode. Each diaphragm with its nozzle electrode and the opposing common
electrode constitutes an electrostatic actuator including a capacitor formed by the nozzle
electrode, the common electrode and an insulator therebetween. A similar electrostatic actuator
or fluid jet ejector is disclosed in US-A-4,520,375. In this latter prior art, by utilizing its
semiconducting property, the thin silicon diaphragm itself forms one electrode of the capacitor.
