<ABSTRACT>
When a slab is drawn while a mold formed of a long wall and a short one is vertically vibrated in the process of vertical 
type continuous casting, said long side wall is moved away from the slab with a hydraulic cylinder (4) actuated in a time zone in 

which large frictional force acts upon the slab. On the contrary, in a time zone in which large frictional force does not act on the 
slab, the long side wall having been kept away from the slab is brought closer thereto. In this way, by moving the long side wall 

away from or closer to the slab repeatedly, a depth of oscillation mark is reduced so that a slab with less segregation at the valley 
of oscillation mark may be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a casting
process for continuous castings, capable of obtaining
the castings reduced in the depths of oscillation marks
and suppressed in segregation at oscillation mark
trough portions, in a continuous casting method,
particularly, a vertical continuous casting method for
metal.Conventionally, for the purpose of eliminating
the repairing work for the surfaces of continuous
castings, there has been proposed a technique of
oscillating a vertical mold for reducing or preventing
positive segregations at oscillation mark trough
portions on the surfaces of the castings, particularly,
in casting stainless steel (SUS 304). For example,
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. hei 2-290656 has disclosed
such a technique that, in a continuous casting mold of
a type forming a casting space with two pairs of mold
wall surfaces, a pair of the mold wall surfaces are
relatively separated from each other only for a negative 
strip time zone in vertical oscillation or for a mold
descending time zone.This technique is recognized to be considerably
effective as compared with a case of giving only simple
vertical oscillation. However, as a result of an
experiment, it is seen that the technique is not much
effective for such a case that the oscillation frequency
〈f〉 of the mold is small. Further, in the above
technique, the consumption of mold powder is reduced,
thereby causing the breakout due to sticking.
Accordingly, on the contrary, there is arisen an
inconvenience of obstructing the stable casting.Conventionally, the mechanism and cause of
generating the segregations at oscillation mark trough
portions were considered as follows: namely, the
negative pressure is generated within a liquid phase
lubricating film between the mold and the solidified
shell due to oscillation of the mold;and due to this
negative pressure, the non-solidified and concentrated
molten steel between dendrites of the solidified
surface layer permeates onto the surface of the shell.However, as a result of the examination on the
segregated portions of the casting by the present
inventors, it was revealed that the segregation is
generated in accordance with such a mechanism that the
continuous growth of the solidified shell is obstructed 
by breaking of the shell due to a tensile force applied
thereto and by buckling due to a compressive force, and
thereby the concentrated liquid flows out from the
broken portions or buckled portions of the shell to the
surface of the shell. Accordingly, for preventing the
segregation, it is

form a casting having an outer surface in the form of a solidified metallic shell, said

mold having a casting space formed by a first pair of opposed walls and a second
pair of opposed walls, said first and second walls being perpendicular to each other

and in contact with said shell, one of said first and second pairs of opposed walls

period corresponding to a period of time said mold requires to upwardly travel from a

lowermost oscillation point to an uppermost oscillation point, and said descending

downwardly travel from said uppermost oscillation point back to said lowermost
oscillation point, said mold having a maximum upward velocity during said ascending

travel period corresponding to a midpoint between said uppermost and uppermost
oscillation points, and said mold having a maximum downward velocity during said

descending travel period corresponding to a midpoint between said uppermost and
lowermost oscillation points, said uppermost and lowermost points corresponding to

a mold position where said mold velocity is zero due to said mold changing between
an upwardly and downwardly travel direction, said casting having a downward
