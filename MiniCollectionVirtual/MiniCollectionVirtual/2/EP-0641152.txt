<ABSTRACT>
The surface of a molding of a synthetic resin is 
metallized by chemical plating or a like method to form a thin 

metal film having a thickness of from 0.2 to 2 µm. The 
metal film is irradiated with laser beams along the contour of 

a portion to be formed into an insulating circuit to remove 
the irradiated metal film so that the insulating circuit 

portion is surrounded by a closed insulating circuit. 
Subsequently, electroplating is performed on a portion to be 

formed into a conductive circuit to form a circuit having a 
desired thickness. Thereafter, flash etching is performed 

with an etchant to remove the thin metal film remaining on the 
insulating circuit portion to form a circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for forming a
conductive circuit on the surface of a molding of a synthetic
resin, and to a process for efficiently producing a molding
having an accurate conductive circuit on its surface, which is
used as a circuit component in the fields of electrical and
electronic equipment.Various processes for forming a circuit on the surface of
a molding of a synthetic resin are known, which include, for
example, one comprising performing double molding of two types
of materials differing in platability and selectively plating
a circuit portion with the utilization of a difference in
platability between the circuit portion and other portions to
thereby form a metallic circuit. This process is complicated
and wasteful because molding must be performed twice.
Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a high adherence between
two types of resins as molding materials, so that problems are
likely to occur, such as the infiltration and residence of a
plating solution in a molded item.Another conventional circuit forming process wherein a
photoresist is applied comprises multiple steps which include
application of a resist, exposure to light in a circuit
pattern, development of the pattern, etching of copper and
peeling of the resist to thereby render the process
complicated. When it is intended to form a three-dimensional
conductive circuit on the surface of a molding of a
three-dimensional configuration, the intended circuit can be
prepared to some satisfaction by the exposure to projected 
parallel rays. However, the accuracy thereof is a problem,
and there is a limit in the above process, depending on the
three-dimensional configuration of the molding as a substrate.In recent years, circuit forming processes in which laser
beams are employed are being developed, which include, for
example, one comprising first forming a metal film having a
thickness satisfactory for use as a conductive circuit on the
surface of a molding and scattering off the metal film at
portions other than the conductive circuit with laser beams to
thereby directly obtain a conductive circuit (Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 83391/1989). This process requires neither
double molding nor resist application and thereby renders the
process very simple. However, this process has a drawback in
that the conductor metal layer for use in the process must
have a relatively large thickness (e.g., 10 µm) so as to
exhibit satisfactory conductivity in a circuit, thereby
rendering it requisite to increase the output of
