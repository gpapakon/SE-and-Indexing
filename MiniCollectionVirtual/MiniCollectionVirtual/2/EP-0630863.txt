<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synthetic quartz 
glass powder suited for use as a raw material for ultra-high 
purity quartz glass products used in the field of 
semiconductor production, especially in the high temperature 
region of not lower than 1,000°C. Crucibles used for producing semiconductor single 
crystals and jigs have been manufactured by powdering 
natural quartz and fusing the powder. Natural quartz, even 
high-quality one, contains various metallic impurities and 
is not well satisfactory in respect of purity. If metallic 
impurities contaminate high-purity single crystals, whose 
importance and demand are increasing with the recent trend 
toward higher performance in the semiconductor industries, 
the performance of the semiconductors produced therefrom is 
adversely affected to an innegligible degree, so that it is 
impossible to use the crucibles or jigs which have the 
possibility of contamination with metallic impurities. 
Thus, high-purity quartz glass powder produced by synthesis 
has been demanded. Recently, quartz glass produced by the sol-gel method 
using alkoxysilane as a raw material has been proposed as a 
high-purity silicate source. For instance, Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 62-176928 (1987) discloses 
a method for producing quartz (silica) glass powder by  
 
hydrolyzing alkoxysilane at a specified pH to prepare a gel, 
powdering the gel, and after drying, calcining the powder. In production of synthetic quartz glass powder by the 
sol-gel method, alkoxysilane used as a raw material is first 
hydrolyzed and polycondensed to form a wet gel and then the 
by-product alcohols and water are removed by drying to 
obtain a dry gel. In the above reaction, however, 100% of 
the alkoxy groups are not reacted and a part thereof remain 
in the dry gel as bound alkoxy groups. Also, the alcohols 
generated as by-product of the reaction are partly left in 
the dry gel. In fact, determinations show that carbon 
concentration in the dry gel is 1,000 to 10,000 ppm. When the dry gel is calcined, carbon is mostly burned 
away but a part thereof may remain unburned and such 
unburned carbon may be trapped in glass to appear as black 
contaminant. When such black contaminant intermixes in a 
synthetic quartz powder product, it may give rise to CO or 
CO₂ gas to cause foaming when the powder product is fused 
for molding into a crucible or an ingot. Attempts have been 
made for preventing formation of such black contaminant; for 
instance, it has been tried to maintain
