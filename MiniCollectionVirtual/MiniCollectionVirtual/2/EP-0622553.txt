<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a nail having an expansion region (3), which, by virtue of a notching operation, exhibits outwardly curved expansion legs (9, 10). Located between the expansion legs (9, 10) is a longitudinal notch (8) which starts from the straight shank portion (7) located in front of the expansion region (3) and runs as far as the front nail end side (5).

<CLAIMS>
A nail having an expansion region formed at a distance from the 
front end face of the nail, from the shank of which nail in the expansion 

region there project laterally two bowed expansible arms, between which 
there runs in the shank a free space, and which continue at both ends of the 

expansion region as straight shank portions, characterized in that the free 
space is in the form of a longitudinal channel (8) which starts from the 

straight shank portion (7) lying at the nail head end before the expansion 
region and extends as far as the front end face (5) of the nail. 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the expansible arms 
(9, 10) are bowed outwardly by indenting the straight shank (2) 

symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the shank, and there is 
a smooth transition at both ends of the expansion region (3) to the straight 

shank portions (6, 7). 
A nail according to claim 2, characterized in that the expansion 
region (3) is approximately circularly rounded in cross-section, and the 

expansible arms (9, 10) are bevelled at their longitudinal edges. 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the longitudinal 
channel (8) has a U-shaped cross-section. 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the nail head (4) 
and the adjoining shank portion (7) has a plastics material covering (13), the 

wall of which terminates flush on the shank (2) before reaching the 
expansion region (3).  

 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the nail (1) has a 
nail head (4) having on its top face a centering indentation (14) that is 

aligned centrally with respect to the longitudinal axis of the shank (2). 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the front end face 
(5) of the nail has a nail tip formed by a slope (11). 
A nail according to claim 1, characterized in that the expansion 
region (3) of the nail (1) is provided with a longitudinal rib (15) of 

triangular profile opposite the longitudinal channel (8). 
A nail according to claim 8, characterized in that the longitudinal rib 
(15) terminates at a distance from the front end face (5) of the nail in a 

tapering point (16).
