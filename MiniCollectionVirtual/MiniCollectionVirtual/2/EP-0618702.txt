<ABSTRACT>
A multiple transmission apparatus including two terminal nodes (40) and (50). The terminal node (40) includes a first bias 
device (41) for biasing a first transmission line (10) of two common transmission lines (10, 11) towards a potential on the power 

supply side, a second bias device (43) for biasing the second transmission line (11) towards the ground side, and a communication 
controller (43) for controlling data transfer, and the terminal node (50) includes a communication controller (51). Connection 

terminals (44 to 47, 52 to 55) are provided for connecting the bias devices (41, 42) and the communication controllers (43, 51) 
to two positions of each of the transmission lines (10, 11), and each terminal node (40, 50) is connected to the transmission lines 

(10, 11) through the connection terminals in the daisy chain connection arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multiplex
transmission apparatus in which a plurality of
terminal nodes are connected to two or more common
transmission lines.Conventionally, in a multiplex transmission
apparatus, a plurality of first terminal nodes, each
including a first bias unit for biasing a first
transmission line, out of two transmission lines (main
, lines), to the supply-side potential, a second bias
unit for biasing a second transmission line to the
ground-side potential, and a communication control
unit for data communication control, and a plurality
of second terminal nodes, each including a
communication control unit for data communication
control, are connected to one another by means of the
common transmission lines. In each first terminal
node, the first bias unit and the communication
control unit are connected to the first transmission
line by means of a first branch line, while the second
bias unit and the communication control unit are
connected to the second transmission line by means of
a second branch line. In each second terminal node,
on the other hand, the communication control unit is
connected to the first and second transmission lines 
by means of two branch lines, individually. The first
and second terminal nodes transfer data between them
through these common transmission lines.In the multiplex transmission apparatus arranged
in this manner, each terminal node is connected to
each transmission line by means of a joint connector
and two branch lines. If one of the branch lines is
cut and when data are to be transmitted and received
by that terminal node which is connected to the
transmission line by means of the cut branch line, the
communication control unit of this terminal node is
disconnected from one of the transmission lines.
Therefore, the data transmission is one-way
transmission by means of the uncut branch line.If the terminal node connected to the cut branch
line is the first terminal node, and when data are to
be transmitted and received by means of this first
terminal node, in this multiplex transmission
apparatus, however, the data transmission is one-way
transmission as in the aforesaid case, and bias
failure is caused, resulting in a double fault. In
the multiplex transmission apparatus, moreover, the
transmission lines and the terminal nodes are
connected to one another by means of the joint
connectors and the branch lines, as mentioned before.
In this multiplex transmission apparatus, therefore,
there are many junctions (usually eight junctions in
this
