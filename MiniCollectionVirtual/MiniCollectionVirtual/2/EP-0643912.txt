<ABSTRACT>
Improved fishhook and method of making the same are 
disclosed. The fishhook includes a fishhook body (1) and a tip 

portion (11) having a hook tip (12) and a barb (2) and extending from said 
hook tip to said barb, the tip portion having upper lateral 

cut faces (21) and lower lateral cut faces (22) on upper and lower 
lateral sides thereof and sharp edges (18,19,20) extending from said 

hook tip to said barb along ridges at junctures of the upper 
lateral cut faces and of said lower lateral cut faces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fishhooks having 
improved barb and hook tip constructions and a novel method 
of making the same. Conventional fishhooks A' have a sharp barb 2' cut and 
raised from the inner side of a tip portion 11' of a fishhook 
body 1' as shown in Fig. 24 or, alternatively, have a 
bulged barb 2 formed at the inner side of a fishhook body 
1'' as shown in Fig. 25. The former type of fishhooks effectively prevents a 
fish bait attached thereon from being dislodged therefrom. 
However, when a fish is caught on the fishhook. the sharp 
tip 4' of the barb 2' cuts into the flesh of the fish and, 
in an attempt to remove the fish from the fishhook, the 
sharp tip of the barb will tear off the flesh of the fish 
and aggravate the damage to the fish. Especially if a 
caught fish is to be released, it is necessary to pay a 
special attention to minimize the damage to the fish when 
removing the fish from the fishhook A'. Though such an 
operation may be relatively easy for experienced fishermen, 
inexperienced fishermen may heavily damage a caught fish  
 
even if they pay the most careful attention. As described above, the barb 2' shown in Fig. 24 which 
is formed by cutting and raising part of the tip portion of 
the fishhook has a sharp groove 13' formed at the base 
portion 5' thereof, and sometimes fine cracks are observed 
at the bottom of the groove 13'. This will lead to the 
breakage of the barb 2 due to an excessive load imposed on 
the base portion 5' of the barb 2' when a caught fish is 
removed from the fishhook A or when a fish caught on the 
fishhook is struggling. Furthermore, the cut and raised barb 2' has a small 
juncture area at the base portion 5' on the fishhook body 
1', i.e., between the barb 2' and the fishhook body 1', and 
therefore the barb 2' may be easily broken due to an intensive 
stress occurring at the sharp groove 13' when a large 
load is applied on the base portion 5' of the barb 2' by a 
large fish caught on the fishhook. The latter type of fishhooks has been proposed to 
solve the problem associated with the former type. Unlike 
the fishhook A shown in Fig. 24. the fishhook A'' having a 
bulged barb 2'' minimizes a damage to a fish, and the bulged 
barb 2'' may be hardly broken. However, it is very difficult 
to manufacture the fishhook A'' with the bulged barb 2''. It 
is also difficult to attach a bait to the fishhook because 
the bulged barb obstructs the passage of the bait. Each of the fishhooks A' and A'' of the conventional  
 
types has a
