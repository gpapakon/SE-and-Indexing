<ABSTRACT>
A system for rotatable mounting of a floating vessel (1) to a submerged loading/unloading buoy (2) which is anchored to the sea bed, the buoy (2) being of the type which is adapted to be introduced into and fastened in a releasable manner in a submerged downwardly open receiving space (3) in the vessel (1), the buoy (2) during operation being connected to at least one transfer line (4) and forming a transfer connection between this line (4) and a tube system (10) on the vessel. The buoy (2) comprises an outer member (15) which is arranged to be rigidly fastened in the receiving space (3), and a central inner member (16) which is rotatably mounted in the outer member (15), so that the vessel (1) is able to turn about the central member (16) when the buoy (2) is fastened in the receiving space (3). Further, the upper end of the central member (16) is connected to the tube system (10) of the vessel through a swivel means (31) and through at least one flexible joint means (33 resp. 34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for rotatable 
mounting of a floating vessel to a submerged loading/unloading 
buoy which is anchored to the sea bed, wherein the buoy is 
arranged to be received and releasably secured in a downwardly 
open receiving space in the vessel, wherein the buoy comprises 
an outer buoyancy member which is arranged to be secured in the 
receiving space, and a central member on which the outer member 
is rotatably mounted, the central member being anchored to the 
sea bed, so that the vessel is able to turn about the central 
member when the outer member is secured in the receiving space, 
and wherein the lower end of the central member is connected to 
at least one transfer line for transfer of medium via the central 
member. A mooring system in the form of a buoy loading system 
of the above-mentioned type is known from US patent specification 
No. 4 490 121. The patent specification shows a number of 
different embodiments, including an embodiment comprising a buoy 
of the above-mentioned type. In this embodiment the receiving 
space for the buoy is arranged in an arm projecting from and 
being fastened to the vessel above the water surface, so that the 
buoy, when this is placed in the receiving space, is lifted 
partly or in its entirety out of the water. Thus, both the 
receiving space and the buoy are subjected to the possibly rough 
and stormy surface conditions. It will be clear that such a 
system is subject to substantial weather limitations and will not 
be able to be operative in rather high sea, both because of 
practical difficulties in connection and disconnection, and 
because of lacking security for the crew under difficult 
conditions with wind and high sea. In the known buoy structure, the central member of the 
buoy consists of a rotating body or turret in which there is 
arranged an axially extending pipe length which, at its upper 
end, is coupled to the pipe system of the vessel through a 
rotatable pipe coupling, i.e. a swivel. A mooring system or buoy loading system of another type  
 
is known from US patent specification No. 4 604 961. This system 
is based on a vessel having a through-going deck opening or 
moonpool of which the lower end constitutes a submerged receiving 
space in which there is arranged a rotating body or turret which 
is rotatably mounted in the hull of the vessel and is designed 
for receipt and attachment of the buoy. Because of the fact that 
the rotating body is mounted to the hull, there arise large 
frictional

<CLAIMS>
A system for rotatably connecting a floating 
vessel to a submerged load
ing/unloading buoy anchored to 
the sea bed, the system comprising a buoy and a 

receiving space arranged in use of the vessel to be 
submerged and downwardly open, wherein the buoy (2) is 

arranged to be received and releasably secured in the 
receiving space (3) in the vessel (1), the buoy (2) 

comprising an outer buoyancy member (15) arranged to be 
secured in the receiving space (3) and a central member 

(16) on which the outer member (15) is rotatably 
mounted, the central member (16) being anchored to the 

sea bed, whereby the vessel is able to turn about the 
central member (16) with the outer member when the outer 

member is secured in the receiving space, and wherein 
the lower end of the central member (16) is connectable to 

at least one transfer line (4) for transfer of the 
medium, and the upper end of the central member (16) is 

connectable through a swivel means (31) to tubing (10) on 
the vessel, the central member constituting a hollow 

shaft (16) coupled at its upper end to the swivel means 
(31) through at least one flexible joint (34) which 

allows angular displacement about the axis of 
connection 

such that in use the medium transferred between the at least one 
transfer line and the tubing on the vessel is conveyed by said 

hollow shaft. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein the swivel 
means (31) is coupled to a coupling head (30) in a 

coupling unit (9) communicating with the tubing (10), 
the coupling head (30) having a flexible joint (33) at 

the transition to the coupling unit (9). 
A system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
central member (16) is provided with a flexible joint 

(35) at its lower end for moment-free transfer of forces 
from the transfer line (4) to the buoy (2). 
A system according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 
or each flexible joint (33,34,35) is a spherical joint.
