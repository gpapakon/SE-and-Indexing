<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a decompression device (9) 
in communication with sucking means (3,10) which can be 

unrolled, an intermediate vessel (6) for the provisional 
storing of the waste liquids sucked during a single 

sucking phase and a final storage vessel (8) for the 
storage of the waste liquids sucked during a plurality of 

sucking phases. The sucking method comprises a first phase 
of payment in advance, a sucking phase of the liquids from 

said watercrafts into said intermediate vessel started by 
said payment phase and a storing phase at the end of said 

sucking phase. 
The apparatus has a reduced encumbrance and costs 
and it allows the payment in advance of the sucking 

operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
the semi-automatic sucking of oily bilge-waters and other
waste liquids from small and medium watercrafts. The
present invention further relates to the sucking method
used by said apparatus.It is well known that the discharge of the bilge
waters and other oily waters or waste liquids from the
ships is a problem that has already been overcome and
every harbour is provided with means such as lighters,
auto drainage apparatuses or the like, which such an
important facility is provided for.Thanks to such systems, the oily waters discharged
from the ships are collected and sent to conditioning
centres wherein oils are regenerated so that they can be
used again, whereas the water, without any oily
substances, is discharged into the sea after being
purified according to the law.However, waters trading doesn't comprise only big
ships, because there are also a lot of small or medium
sized boats and other watercrafts, both touristic and
commercial, such as fishing-boats, yachts, small ferry-boats,
patrol motorboats etc., which have the same problem
of the discharge of the bilge-waters even though in a
smaller way.The present means mentioned above is sized for the
needs of big ships and therefore is not suitable to be
used by medium and small watercrafts, because of the high
costs involved.In fact, it is difficult to think that the shipowner
or the proprietor of a fishing boat or a yacht can afford
the use of big auto drainage apparatuses or a lighter for
discharging just a few hundreds litres of oily liquids.For these reasons, the users of medium and small
watercrafts normally discharge their dirty bilge waters 
into the sea, thus infringing the severe environmental
laws and above all creating serious pollution problems. In
fact such behaviour, if followed by only a part of the
circulating watercrafts, and although the amount of oils
discharged every day in the sea by each of them is little,
would cause high polluting levels able to threaten the
sea's already weak environmental balance.Therefore, the problem of extending the sucking
facilities of the dirty bilge waters to pleasure boats
and other small watercrafts is more and more felt.In order to overcome these problems, a dockside
system for the collection and disposal of bilge waters and
waste oils is known, as disclosed in US patent 4623452.This system, however, is not able to solve two
further problems which are in connection with the above
needs.A first problem is linked to the fact that said
dockside system

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the semi-automatic sucking of oily
bilge-waters and other waste liquids from small and medium

watercrafts without the presence of operative personnel,
comprising a flexible tube (10) having an end (10a) which

is suitable for being plunged in a liquid to be sucked,
collecting means (6,8) of said liquid communicating with

said flexible tube (10), sucking means (9) creating vacuum

conditions in said collecting means (6), characterised in
that said collecting means comprises an intermediate

vessel (6) of fixed capacity in which vacuum conditions
are created by said sucking means (9) during a single

sucking phase, a storage vessel (8) receiving the liquid
sucked into said intermediate vessel at the end of each

sucking phase, said sucking means (9) creating said vacuum
conditions only during said sucking phase, payment means

(17) being further provided for starting said sucking
phase, as well as means for the input of the user's data

and for choosing sucking mode.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
intermediate vessel (6) communicates with said storage

vessel (8) by means of an electrovalve (7) controlled by a
processing unit (4), the latter being in connection with a

timer and with a sensor (15) of the liquid level present
in said intermediate vessel (6)
Apparatus according to the previous claims, wherein
said sucking means comprises a pump (9) included in a

circuit (16) provided with a filter (13), and a safety
valve (12).
Apparatus according to the previous claims, wherein a
support cover (1) is provided on which said processing

unit (4), a screen (5) with printer and a keyboard (2) for
the input of the users' data and for choosing sucking

programmes are mounted, said support cover (1) comprising 
also means for blocking the access to said tube (10) and

for stopping the power supply to said winding (3) and
sucking means (9).
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said means for
blocking comprises said payment means (17) electrically

connected with said processing unit and an access opening
(1b) to said flexible tube (10) which can be shut by a

gate operated by said processing unit (4).
Apparatus according to the previous claims, wherein
said storage vessel (8) extends above said electrovalve

(7) and an auxiliary pump (18) is provided to push the
liquid from said intermediate vessel (6) to said storage

vessel (8), when the level (L) of the liquid is higher
than the position of said electrovalve (7).
A method for the semi-automatic sucking of oily bilge-waters
and other waste liquids from small and medium

watercrafts, in an apparatus comprising a flexible tube
(10) with an end (10a) suitable of being plunged in a

liquid to be sucked, collecting means (6, 8) of said
liquid communicating with said flexible tube, sucking

means for creating vacuum conditions in said collecting
means wich comprise an intermediate vessel (6) and a

storage vessel (8), payment means and user's data input
and sucking mode selection means, the method being

characterised in that it comprises the following phases:

a payment phase;
an user's data input and sucking mode selection phase;
a sucking phase started by said payment phase and during
which said liquids are transferred from said watercrafts

into said intermediate vessel (6) through a flexible tube;
a storing phase at the end of said sucking phase during
which said liquids sucked from said intermediate vessel

(6) are transferred into said storage vessel (8).
Method according to claim 7 wherein said sucking phase 
stops in one of the following cases:


a volume of liquid corresponding to the capacity of said
intermediate vessel (6) has been sucked;
the programmed time has finished or the maximum allowed
time has elapsed.
Method according to claim 8 wherein at the end of said
