<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to novel barbiturate derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies or receptors to the barbiturate metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies or receptors using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies or receptors and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONNovel Barbiturate Derivatives and Protein and Polypeptide Barbiturate DerivativeConjugates and LabelsField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of ligand receptor assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of selected metabolites of barbiturates in a fluid sample. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for the synthesis of novel barbiturate derivatives and protein and polypeptide barbiturate derivative conjugates and labels for use in the preparation of antibodies to barbi¬ turate metabolites and for use in the.immunoassay process.Background of the InventionThe class of barbiturate derivatives is extensive and in general they are characterized by the amide urea ring with various alkyl substituents off the 5' position. Bar¬ biturates are used as sedatives, hypnotics and to control seizures. The class of barbiturates includes, but is not limited to, amobarbital, aprobarbital, barbital, butabar- bital, mephobarbital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital and secobarbital. The illicit and excessive use of barbitur¬ ates has resulted in a medical need for antibodies and diagnostics to rapidly detect the barbiturate metabolites in order to monitor and treat barbiturate addiction.The preparation of antibodies to barbiturate metabo¬ lites requires the synthesis of a barbiturate derivative in order to covalently attach the derivative to an anti- genie polypeptide or protein. In addition, the barbitur¬ ate derivative is covalently attached to various polypep¬ tides, proteins or labels for use in screening antibodies and in the immunoassay process. The barbiturate deriva¬ tive should mimic the structure of the class of barbitur- ate metabolites sought to be measured. Therefore, the 

selection and synthesis of the types of barbiturate deriv¬ atives for covalent attachment to proteins, polypeptides or labels is critical. In addition, the barbiturate derivatives need to be stable and soluble in an aqueous solution.Summary of the InventionThe present invention is directed to novel barbitur¬ ate derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies to the barbiturate metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the produc¬ tion of antibodies using standard methods. Once genera¬ ted, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.DefinitionsIn accordance with the present invention and as used
