<ABSTRACT>
Flow/conditioning duct (1) for molten glass, including a channel and superstructure (5) and intended for transferring the molten glass from a zone for melting/refining (6) vitrifiable substances towards a zone for forming molten glass in order to bring it from its melting temperature to its forming temperature. It comprises a plurality of successive zones (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) arranged substantially transversely in relation to its lengthwise axis, each zone having its own function, being independently thermally controlled and being isolated over a part of its height in relation to the adjacent zones by separating means (15), the said zones including at least one transition zone (8), at least one drainage zone (9), at least one cooling zone (10, 11, 12) and at least one zone (13, 14) for thermal and/or chemical homogenisation.
