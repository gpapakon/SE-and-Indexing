substituent group selected from halo, alkyl, alkoxy, protected hydroxy, nitro, 
cyano and trifluoromethyl; a group of the formula R₂ -- O -- wherein R₂ is t-butyl, 

2,2,2- trichloroethyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl; a group of the formula 
R₃-(O)
n
-CH₂ wherein R₃ is phenyl or substi-tuted phenyl with the substituent 

group selected from halo, alkyl, alkoxy, protected hydroxy, nitro, cyano or 
trifluoromethyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl or 1,4-cyclohexadienyl, and

wherein R₄ 
has the same meaning as R₃ defined above and W is a protected hydroxy or 

protected amino group; and R₁ is a carboxylic acid protecting group selected 
from the group consisting of C₁-C₄ alkyl, 2,2,2-trihalo alkyl, benzyl, substituted 

benzyl, like p-nitrobenzyl, phenacyl, halo substituted phenacyl and benzhydryl, 
is disclosed. Such compound is prepared by reacting a penicillin sulfoxide 

ester of the general formula 

wherein R and R₁ have the meanings defined above with an N-chloro 
halogenating agent in an inert organic solvent. The reaction is carried out in 

the presence of an acid scavening amount of a phosphate or hydrogen 
phosphate of an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, quaternary 

ammonium or mixtures of any thereof. These compounds find application as 
an intermediate in the production of cefaclor which are powerful anti-bacterial 

compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of 2-chloro
sulfinyl azetidinones. More particularly, the invention relates to an
improved method for the preparation of 2-chloro sulfinyl azetidin-4-one by the
reaction of a penicillin sulfoxide ester with an N-chloro halogenating agent
which is considerably less expensive than methods of the prior art.The resulting product 2-chloro sulfinyl azetidin-4-one constitutes an important
intermediate in the production of 3-exomethylene cepham carboxylate-1-oxides.
The latter, on further elaboration, yield 3-chloro-cephem carboxylates such as
cefaclor which are powerful anti-bacterial compounds that find use in
pharmaceutical formulations.The basic problem with prior art processes for the preparation of 2-chloro
sulfinyl azetidinones from the reaction of a penicillin sulfoxide ester and an N-chloro
halogenating agent resides in the unavoidable production at the elevated
temperature of the reaction of large amounts of hydrochloric acid. The
presence of the generated hydrochloric acid affects adversely the yield of the
end product. In fact, if the hydrochloric acid is allowed to remain in the
reaction medium, the azetidinone yield decreases considerably. It has,
therefore, been the object of manufacturers to provide ways whereby the
hydrochloric acid generated is neutralised.Prior U. S. Patents Nos. 4,052,387 and 4,081,440 disclose processes for the
preparation of 2-chloro sulfinyl azetidine-4-one by the treatment of the
corresponding penicillin sulfoxide ester with an N-chloro halogenating agent in
an inert solvent, the reaction being carried out in the presence (or absence) of
an alkene oxide acid scavenger such as propylene oxide or butylene oxide to
remove any hydrochloric acid formed during the reaction. Unfortunately, the
subsequent conversion of 2-chloro sulfinyl azetidin-4-one to 3-chloro-cephem
carboxylate is exceedingly poor being only in the range of 25% to 40%.U. S. Patent No. 4,165,315 discloses a method similar to that of the two above-mentioned
U. S. patents. U. S. Patents Nos. 4,075,203 and 4,165,316 disclose the employment of a
combination of alkylene oxide and calcium oxide as a hydrochloric acid
scavenger in the reaction of a penicillin sulfoxide ester with an N-chloro
halogenating agent to produce 2-chloro sulfinyl azetidin-4-one.U. S. Patent No. 4,289,695 discloses the use of a weakly basic, organic solvent-insoluble
poly-4-vinyl pyridine polymer partially cross-linked with
divinylbenzene as the hydrogen chloride
