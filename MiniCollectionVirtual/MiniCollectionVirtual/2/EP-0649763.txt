<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of a lever (1) bearing, in lateral projection, a pressing shoe (10) for exerting a pressure on the bead of the tyre, one end of which lever is equipped with a handle (2) and the other end with a pivot (3) to which a spindle (4) is fastened with capability to pivot, the height-adjustable bar (11) of the apparatus (12) is preset to the dimension of the wheel to be operated on, being provided with a means (13) into which the spindle (4) is removably inserted so that the lever (1) can pivot in a vertical and horizontal plane and so that the shoe (10) of the lever can bear on the upper side wall or bead of the tyre (A) without prior adjustment so as to press this bead into the circumferential hollow (19) of the wheel, the supporting structure (14) being equipped with a rising support (15) into which the spindle (4) is inserted removably so that the lever can pivot in a vertical and horizontal plane, and so that the shoe (10) of the lever (1) can bear on the lower bead of the tyre in order to push this bead upwards into the circumferential hollow (19) of the wheel.
