<ABSTRACT>
Improved collection optics for a lighting system 
comprised of a light source, reflector and light 

receptive component include a multi-portion reflector 
or a non-imaging optical collector having a positive 

curvature located at an input end to the light 
receptive component. The collection optics capture 

additional lumens for transmission through the light 
guide. The optical arrangement can also collect 

different colors of light from the source that would 
otherwise be omitted from transmission through the 

light receptive component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to collection optics for a 
high brightness discharge light source. More 
particularly, the invention relates to modification of 
known optical arrangements which use an elliptical or 
ellipsoidal reflector with a high brightness light 
source located at a first focal point of the reflector 
and an input end of a light receptive component such as 
a light guide or light conductor placed at a second 
focus of the reflector for transmitting light to a 
remote location. However, it will be understood that 
the invention has broader applications and may be 
advantageously employed in a number of other lighting 
environments and applications. Particular 
lighting systems require a high level of lumens for 
selected applications. For example, when using an 
optical fiber or light guide to carry the light to a 
remote location in the system, it is important to 
collect a maximum amount of the light emitted from the 
light source and input the light into the end of the 
light guide. The amount of light can be measured as 
number of lumens per unit area, i.e., lumen density, 
and the transmission optics plays an important role in 
maximizing the lumen density. Typically, there is a tradeoff between lumen 
density and the cross-sectional dimension of the light 
guide. In general, the smaller the size of the light 
guide, the higher the lumen density. This higher 
density, however, comes at the expense of less 
collected lumens. Decreasing the size of the entrance  
 
aperture is also limited by the requirement that the 
transition optics must be sufficiently enlarged 
relative to the magnified image of the source in order 
to collect sufficient lumens. Therefore, it is 
generally preferred to maintain a slightly larger 
entrance aperture which, in turn, requires collection 
of a greater number of lumens from the light source to 
achieve the goal of increased lumen density. An elliptical or truncated elliptical reflector is 
often used to direct light received from the discharge 
light source into the light guide. Unfortunately, any 
light emitted from the light source at a region 
adjacent to, but slightly spaced or offset from, the 
first focus is not directed into the light guide. 
Light from the offset region is imaged or focused at an 
area spaced from the input end of the light guide, and 
thus does not contribute to the light carried by the 
light guide. Lumen density in the light guide thus has 
no contribution from this additional light emitted from 
the light source. By way of
