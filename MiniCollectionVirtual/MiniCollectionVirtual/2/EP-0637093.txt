<ABSTRACT>
A roof antenna capable of receiving three kinds of bands, i.e., a FM radio band, an AM 

radio band, and a wireless-telephone band, includes an antenna element 10 having a 
structure that a conductor 15 winds around the insulator 16 in the form of a coil. A 

molded portion 14 is formed at the bottom of the antenna element, in which a trap coil 
is inserted. The electric length from the antenna top 11 to the internal metal fitting 17 

at the lower end of the antenna element 10 is about a quarter of a FM radio wave. The 
electric length from the internal metal fitting 17 to the lower end of the trap coil 12 is 

about a quarter of a wireless telephone wave. A cover 19 supporting a basal part of the 
antenna element installs the first substrate 20 and the second substrate 21. The first 

substrate 20 and the second substrate 21 have a matching circuit, branching filters, and 
amplifiers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna.An antenna according to the present invention may be
used in a number of applications. For instance, the
antenna may be mounted in use to a house for receiving TV,
radio or mobile phone signals. However, the present
invention is particularly useful when the antenna is
mounted to a vehicle, such as the roof of a car. For
convenience, reference shall only be made hereinafter to a
roof antenna for a car.There are various kinds of car antennas. Recently, a
roof antenna set up on the roof of a car is popular because
setting up an antenna at the highest place enhances the
sensitivity. Since a FM radio and an AM radio are
generally fixed inside a car, a roof antenna capable of
receiving radio waves in both a FM radio band and an AM
radio band has been spreading.As shown in Fig. 12, such a conventional roof antenna
100 capable of receiving waves within two kinds of bands is
fixed in the rear part of a car roof. Fig. 13 illustrates
a circuit of the roof antenna 100. Fig. 14 shows an
external appearance of the roof antenna 100 in detail.As shown in Fig. 13, a signal received by the antenna
element 101 fixed on a car roof is induced into the inside
of a car through a matching circuit 102 and input to an
amplifying unit 103 disposed in the car. Note that the
matching circuit 102 works so that the antenna element 101
matches to a FM radio band.Then, signals input to the amplifying unit 103 are
branched into two kinds of signals, i.e. signals for a FM
band and signals for an AM band by a branching filter 
104, and both kinds of signals are amplified by amplifiers 105 and 106, respectively.
The amplified FM signals are output from an output terminal 107 and induced into a FM
receiver. The amplified AM signals are output from an output terminal 108 and induced
into an AM receiver.When a receiver can receive both AM and FM signals, signals which are
output from an output terminal 107 or 108 are first combined, and then, induced into an
AM/FM receiver through a cable.As shown in Fig. 14, this type of roof antenna has an antenna top 114 at the
top end of an antenna element 113. The base portion of the antenna element 113 is
molded to be a basal part 112 of the antenna element. The basal part 112 of the antenna
element is attached to a cover 111, thereby the antenna element 113 is supported by an
antenna case. The cover 111 has the matching circuit 102 therein. The cover 111 and
an antenna base 110 engaged with the cover 111 constitute the antenna case. The
antenna case is
