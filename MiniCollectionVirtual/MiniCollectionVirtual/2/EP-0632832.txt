<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEIN KINASESThis application is a Continuation-in-Partof U.S. Application Serial No. 08/008,001, filed January 21, 1993, which is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. Application Serial No. 728,783, filed July 3, 1991.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which correspond to the class of protein kinase isolates heretofore referred to as casein kinase I and which possess protein kinase and/or DNA recombination/repair promoting functional capabilities.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProtein KinasesThe protein kinases comprise an exceptionally large family of eukaryotic proteins which mediate the responses of cells to external stimuli and are related by amino acid sequence homology within the so-called "catalytic domain" of the enzymes. To date, in excess of 100 unique members of the protein kinase family from a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms have been described and characterized at the amino acid sequence level. See, e.g., Hanks, et al. (Science, 241-42-52, 1988) which presents a sequence alignment of 65 protein kinase catalytic domains which range in size from about 250 to 300 amino acids and Hanks, et al. (Methods in Enzymol, 200:38-62, 1991) presenting a catalytic domain sequence alignment for 117 distinct protein kinase family members including a variety of vertebrate, invertebrate, higher plant and yeast species enzymes. The location of the catalytic domain within a protein kinase is not fixed. In most single subunit enzymes, the domain is near the carboxy terminus of the polypeptide while in multimeric protein kinases the catalytic domain takes up almost the entirety of the subunit polypeptide.Protein kinases are generally classified into a protein- serine/threonine subfamily or a protein-tyrosine subfamily on the basis of phosphorylation substrate specificity. Among the many classes of enzymes within 

the protein-serine/threonine kinase subfamily are two distinct classes which have been designated casein kinase I and casein kinase II based on the order of their elution from DEAE-cellulose. The casein kinases are distinguished from other protein kinases by their ability to phosphorylate serine or threonine residues within acidic recognition sequences such as found in casein. Tuazon, et al. , (Adv. in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Res. , 23:123-164, 1991) presents a review of over 200 publications related to casein kinase I and II, addressing the physicochemical characterization, recognition sequences, substrate specificity and
