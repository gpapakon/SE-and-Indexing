<ABSTRACT>
The method of joining a coupling member to a pipe end is described. The method is particularly concerned with providing a coupling member (12) on the end of a pipe (10) of composite construction formed from a plurality of helically wound reinforcement strips of steel. The method comprises the steps of forming at least one generally circumferentially directed groove (20) in the outer surface of the pipe wall adjacent the end of the pipe to a depth extending into the reinforcement core, providing a coupling member adapted to fit the end of the pipe overlapping the region of the groove or groove, providing key (32) means to extend between said sleeve and said groove in said pipe, providing a curable resin (34) in the joint area between said pipe and said sleeve and curing said resin to bond said coupling member to said pipe end. The resultant coupling is of increased efficiency in providing both an adhesively bonded and mechanically coupled joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of attaching a coupling member to the end of a
pipe particularly to the end of a composite construction pipe formed from a plurality of
helically wound reinforcement strips embedded in a resin matrix.In our co-pending international patent application number PCT/GB93/02483 of common
filing date herewith, we describe a pipe construction comprising a plurality of layers of steel
strip which are helically wound to form a pipe and embedded in a resin matrix, the pipe
further including inner and outer linings of filament wound fibre reinforced plastic. In order
to utilise these pipes, it is necessary to be able to join together separate lengths or to join
pipe lengths to plant. Conventional pipe joining techniques are not directly applicable either
to pipe constructed as described or to the medium to high pressure applications which are
envisaged.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of joining a
coupling member to the end of a pipe, the method comprising the steps of forming at least
one generally circumferentially directed groove in the surface of the pipe wall adjacent the
end of the pipe; providing a coupling member adapted to fit the end of the pipe and
overlapping the region of the groove; providing key means to extend between said coupling
member and said pipe and into said groove; the method being characterised by providing
curable resin in the joint area between the pipe and said coupling member; and curing said
curable resin to bond said coupling member to said pipe end, and wherein the pipe is of
composite construction comprising a core formed from a plurality of layers of helically
wound reinforcing strip embedded in a resin matrix, and the depth of the said groove
penetrates the rcinforcing core of the pipe.Preferably the pipe has an internal and/or external lining of fibre reinforced plastic. Preferably the reinforcing strip is of steel, and the coupling member and the key means are
preferably also of steel or other material having similar mechanical properties. The resin may be injected into the joint area after fitting the coupling member, and/or may De
coated onto the joint mating faces prior to fitting.In one embodiment, the coupling member may be of tubular construction having a
circumferentially directed groove or grooves formed in the inner surface thereof and which are
axially coincident with the at least one groove on the pipe. The sleeve may be provided with a
tangential slot extending through the wall
