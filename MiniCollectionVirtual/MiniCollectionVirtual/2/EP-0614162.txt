<ABSTRACT>
An analog communication system having an analog-to-digital 
storage system including a transmitter (350) and at 

least one remote receiver (10, 358) for receiving an 
incoming signal carrying an analog component. The system 

is adapted to transmit analog messages at a high rate to 
conserve transmission time and to record and play back the 

message at a slower audible rate. The system circuitry 
includes a decoder (16, 220) which may be programmed to 

recognize an address code specific to a particular receiver 
or group of receivers, or may be activated simply by the 

incoming signal without an address code to emit the enable 
signal. The decoder includes rate memory for storing 

record and playback rates in memory sectors corresponding 
to the memory sector of RAM in which the message is stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communication systems 
and more particularly to a system for the transmission of 
analog signals at one speed, the conversion of the 
transmitted analog signals to digital for digital storage 
and for the retrieval and reconversion to analog format of 
such signals for playback of the transmitted data at a 
different speed. The prior art is replete with various types of paging 
systems and radio-operated systems by which a message can 
be left for an individual who is not able to be contacted 
directly for one reason or another. For example, many 
paging systems operate with a large complex central 
processing facility in which messages are queued and 
transmitted, normally in digital form, to subscribers along 
with the subscriber's address code. The subscriber to the 
service carries a paging unit which is preprogrammed to 
activate upon receiving a message which is preceded by the 
address code for that paging unit. The pager then normally 
emits an audible sound to alert the subscriber that a 
message is being received and stored for him. The message 
is placed in the pager memory and the message is retrieved 
in the form of a display message, normally on an LED or LCD 
display screen. Although such systems are efficient and 
require very little air time in order to send the digital 
message, the messages transmitted are necessarily of 
limited duration and are normally of the type which require 
the subscriber to go to the nearest telephone and call the 
message originator. In addition, unless the transmitted 
messages are strictly numeric, i.e., telephone numbers and 
the like, alphanumeric messages require a special terminal 
in order to input the alphanumeric message to be 
transmitted, and paging systems of this type require 
expensive computerized central message facilities.  Other paging systems are available which utilize a 
transmitter which transmits in analog form an audio message 
preceded by an address code which is received by a 
preprogrammed receiver. The message is played immediately 
upon receipt, and, in some units, the message can be 
recorded on a tape cassette for replay. Pagers of this 
type are normally relatively bulky and require 
substantially high power requirements to drive the 
mechanical portions of the tape recorder. In the area of telephone communications, answering 
machines are available which are provided with one or more 
tape cassettes for playing a message to the caller to 
indicate that the called party is not available to

<CLAIMS>
A voice storage communication system including: 
   at least one transmitting station (350) 

selectively addressing and transmitting a communication 
packet including an address code followed by a voice 

message; 
   at least one receiving station (10,358) having a 

corresponding predetermined stored address, comprising: 

a. a receiver circuit (14,214) for receiving an 
incoming signal carrying said communication packet; 

wherein the said improvement is characterised by: 
b. decoder circuitry (16,220) responsive to said 
receiver circuit for emitting a record enable signal 

responsive to said communication packet carried by said 
incoming signal, including: 

   a comparator for comparing said predetermined 
stored address with said communication packet address 

code and automatically generating said record enable in 
response to said comparison, without reference to a 

separate record enable command from said transmitter; 
c. message memory (78) for storing data samples 
representative of said voice message of said 

communication packet in response to said record enable 
signal; 
d. signal conversion circuitry (20,222) for 
converting data samples stored in said message memory 

into analog message information for playback. 
The voice storage communication system as defined in 
Claim 1, additionally characterised by: 

   a memory address selector for storing information 
indicative of available memory space to protect said 

message memory from recording over previously stored 
messages. 
A voice storage communication system as defined in 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said signal conversion circuitry 

(20,222) converts said voice message of said communication 
packet from analog to digital format.
