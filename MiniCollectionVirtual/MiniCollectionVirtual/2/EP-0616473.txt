<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
correction apparatus for correcting images which are
displayed in a color television receiver, and more
particularly to an image correction apparatus for
automatically making various corrections such as convergence
correction, geometric distortion correction,
brightness correction, and focus correction.Generally, in a projection type display or
video projector for projecting enlarged images onto a
screen by using three projection tubes respectively
producing three primary colors, conditions such as
color separation, brightness variation and out-of-focus
may occur in displaying the images on the screen. This
is because the incident angles of the respective projecting
tubes with respect to the screen are different
from one another.These conditions can be corrected manually by
viewing images with the eye. However, such a work
requires a large amount of time for correcting images.A digital convergence apparatus, implementing
a method for achieving highly accurate convergence, is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-8114.
An automatic convergence correction apparatus, implementing
a method for automatically correcting deflection
distortion, is disclosed, for example, in Japanese
Patent Publication Nos. 3-38797 and 1-48553, and 
U.S. Patent No. 4,999,703. A convergence error correcting
method for detecting and correcting convergence
errors is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
No. 64-54993. A convergence error correction
apparatus for a projection type display, implementing a
method for automatically detecting and correcting
convergence errors, is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open
Patent Publication No. 63-48987.Figure 38 shows a configuration of a prior
art automatic convergence correction apparatus for
automatically correcting misconvergence.The automatic convergence correction apparatus
includes a display device 101 which is to be adjusted
for convergence; a signal generator 102 for
generating a signal for adjusting the convergence; a
signal selector 103; an imaging device 104 for capturing
an image displayed on the display device 101; an
image processor 105 for calculating the centroid and
detecting the amount of misconvergence; and a controller
106 for controlling the signal generator 102, the
signal selector 103 and the image processor 105.The operation of the automatic convergence
correction apparatus having the configuration mentioned
above will be described below.The signal generator 102 generates a repetitive
pattern of a low
