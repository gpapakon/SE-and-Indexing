Fault-current circuit breaker which contains a 
latching mechanism with a magnetic trip element and 

means for self-monitoring, characterised in that 
associated with the latching mechanism there is a 

closed circuit with a holding coil (8) for closed-circuit 
tripping, on the one hand, and an open circuit 

with a compensating coil (4) for open-circuit tripping 
on the other hand, with the combination of the open-circuit 

tripping with the closed-circuit tripping 
taking place within the context of the intrinsically 

safe self-monitoring in such a way that in the case of 
a disturbance the latching mechanism is unlocked by 

current reversal in the holding coil (8) or else 
tripping is effected by applying the same potential to 

both ends of the holding coil (8). 
Fault-current circuit breaker according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the holding coil (8), 

the one end of which is at mid-potential, is activated 
by means of at least one amplifier (14, 15). 
Fault-current circuit breaker according to 
claim 1, characterised in that a monitoring circuit 

arrangement (2) is provided, which monitoring circuit 
arrangement (2) contains the open circuit with the 

compensating coil (4), which at an input (E₃) is 
connected to a current supply (+U
b2
), and contains the 
closed circuit with the holding coil (8), superimposed 

upon the holding current of which there are 
identification pulses (7) which are prescribed by an 

activating circuit arrangement (10). 
Fault-current circuit breaker according to 
claim 3, characterised in that the activating circuit 

arrangement (10) for the holding coil (8) contains a 
function chain, prescribed for the input (E₁) of which 

chain there is a pulse train of square-wave pulses (5) 
for the identification pulses (7) and which chain  

 
contains at least one amplifier (14, 15) and the output 

signal of which chain is prescribed for the monitoring 
circuit arrangement (2) which in the absence of the 

identification pulses (7), in the event of a 
disturbance, by means of corresponding activation of 

the amplifier (14, 15) effects a reversal of the 
current direction in the holding coil (8).
