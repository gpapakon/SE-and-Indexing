<ABSTRACT>
A process has been developed for treating plastic and plastic 
composite materials wherein a protective epoxy coating is placed on said 

material by contacting with a composition comprising an epoxy resin, an 
effective amount of curing agent for the epoxy resin, an alcohol and a 

hydrocarbon solvent. In another embodiment, the protective epoxy coating 
is applied by a process comprising the sequential contacting of the plastic 

or plastic composite surface with a first hydrocarbon solution comprised of 
an epoxy resin and a hydrocarbon solvent, and a second hydrocarbon solution 

comprised of an alcohol, a curing agent, and a hydrocarbon solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for protecting, repairing and
thereby extending the life of plastic and plastic composite materials.Plastic and plastic composite materials are receiving widespread
application as stress-bearing structural members because of weight,
strength and cost advantages over metal counterparts which perform
substantially the same function. These materials can also be used as
coatings and liners thereby preventing the direct environmental exposure of
an internal substrate which may be the major stress-bearing element (ex.
coatings on metal pipe and tubing). However, plastic and plastic composite
materials are also susceptible to degradation from environmental exposure
to various gases, liquids, solids, radiation and heat. The resulting
degradation can occur rapidly or over a long term (aging) and can result in
an overall reduction in the mechanical strength of a given component.
Furthermore, the various degradation processes can interact and thereby
increase the susceptibility of the plastic or plastic composite material to
the degrade.As an example, the sorption of moisture by epoxies is often
accompanied by a lowering of the glass transition temperature. This 
sorption then causes the epoxies to soften at lower temperatures and to
also undergo a deterioration in mechanical response. The aging
characteristics of epoxy composite matrixes in many service environments
depend on the degree of deterioration of the high temperature mechanical
properties caused by the sorption and accompanying plasticizing effect of
sorbed moisture.Sorbed moisture in epoxies can also cause epoxy matrixes to swell
and the resulting stresses from swelling can significantly affect the
durability of composite matrixes. Swelling stresses caused by moisture
gradients, together with other stresses inherent in the material, such as
fabrication stresses, can be of such magnitude as to cause localized
fracturing of the polymer matrix. This localized fracturing can then
increase the matrix permeability to other gases and when used as a lining
or coating, reduce the effectiveness of the matrix medium to protect
specific items such as metals from exposure to corrosive environments.
Although the moisture induced swelling of epoxies generally results in only
a one to two percent increase in thickness, dimensional changes of this
magnitude in a composite material are sufficient to produce significant
internal stresses as the fibers attempt to constrain the swelling.
Absorbed moisture has also been shown to reduce
