<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a control plate for vehicles or work tools which are equipped with a monitor of a control system, there is arranged a display which can be pivoted and tilted about two axes at an angle to one another, is situated within reach of an operating person in order to act as a monitor and can therefore be adjusted to be without glare under any operating conditions. This display (30) may be part of a display and operating unit (20) which is equipped in addition with an operating panel (26) which can be pivoted between a using position within the direct reach of an operating piston and an out-of-use position.

Control station for vehicles or working implements, in particular 
for crane installations, construction machines or the like, with a seat 

(13) for an operating person, with a monitor for a control system and 
with indicating instruments in viewing range as well as at least one, 

in a given case multifunction operating element (18) in direct access 
range of an operating person received in the seat (13), in which 

station the monitor is constructed as a display (30), which is 
pivotable and inclinable about two axes (32, 33) each extending at an 

angle to the other and which is fastened independently of the seat (13) 
and in the direct access and viewing range of the operating person, 

wherein this display is associated with a control panel (26), 
characterised thereby, that this display (30) is adjustable vertically 

in such a manner that it is lowerable in a setting of non-use into a 
receiving space (22) with a closable slide-in opening (23), wherein the 

slide-in opening (23) is closable by means of the appropriately 
pivotably hinged control panel (26). 
Control station according to claim 1, characterised by a display 
and control unit (20) with the display (30) and with the control panel 

(26), which comprises function keys (27) and is pivotable between a 
position of non-use and a position of use in direct access range of an 

operating person received in the seat (13). 
Control station according to claim 1, characterised by the 
reception of the display (30) on a slide-in unit (31), which is 

separable from the receiving space (22) and/or from guide elements 
providing the vertical adjustability. 
Control station according to claim 3, characterised thereby, that 
the slide-in unit (31) is provided with electrical plug contacts which 

automatically get into and out of contact with plug sockets of the 
receiving space (22) or of the guide elements during the sliding-in or 

sliding-out, respectively.  
 
Control station according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised thereby, that the control panel (26) is hinged to be 

pivotable in the region of an edge of the slide-in opening of the 
receiving space and serves as closable cover for the slide-in opening 

(23). 
Control station according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that 
the function keys (27) of the control panel (26) are arranged on that 

side of the panel, which faces the receiving space when the panel is 
pivoted into the slide-in opening (23) of the receiving space (22), 

thus into the setting of non-use. 
Control station according to claim 5 or 6, characterised thereby, 
that the display and control unit (20) for the control system comprises a 

columnar housing (22) with a receiving space displaying an upper slide-in 
opening (23). 
Control station according to claim 7, characterised thereby, that 
the display and control unit (20) for the control system is arranged 

directly adjacent to the operating element (18) and that the control 
panel (26) is hinged on that side of the slide-in opening (23), which 

faces the seat (13) for an operating person, as well as in its setting 
of use stands detented to be handy in the direct access range of an 

operating person received in the seat. 
Control station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the display (30) in one mode of operation 

resets itself in both axes according to presettable algorithms, such as 
displacement travel, speed or the like, automatically until 

interruption of the tracking by the operating person. 
Control station according to claim 9, characterised by a tracking 
algorithm of such kind that the display (30) resets itself from a lower 

abutment in the direction towards an upper abutment by alternating 
horizontal and vertical movement at maximum horizontal and vertical 

speed.
