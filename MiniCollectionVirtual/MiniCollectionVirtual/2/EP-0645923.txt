<ABSTRACT>
In the case of announcements which are made using the broadcast method, a connection is intended to be switched in such a way that a subscriber hears the announcement from the start. To achieve this object, connection requests for an announcement are collected according to the invention and switched through simultaneously once the collection time has elapsed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for simultaneously switching an
announcement to subscribers in a communications system,

characterized in that

a) a connection request from a subscriber for an
announcement which is sent via a number of

announcement ports is allocated- to that
announcement port in whose collection time period

the connection request occurs, with the term
collection time period of an announcement port

meaning a time period before the start of the
announcement via this announcement port,
b) once the collection time period of an announcement
port has elapsed, the connection requests

collected with regard to this are passed through
to this announcement port,
c) the start of the said announcement is carried out
at the said announcement ports with a time delay.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the length of the collection time period is determined
by the communications system as a function of the

number of announcement ports for a specific
announcement, and as a function of the announcement

duration.
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 
the collection time periods of the announcement ports

for a specific announcement are defined by the
communications system in such a way that they do not

overlap in time.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that,

on reaching a specific maximum number of connection
requests collected during the collection time of an

announcement port, that announcement port with the next
subsequent collection time is selected for further

connection requests relating to the same announcement.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that

a tone is passed to the requesting subscribers during
the collection time period.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5 within
a communications system having


a) a central switching network (SN) which is
controlled centrally by a co-ordination processor

(CP),
b) a number of line trunk groups (LTG) which form the
interfaces of subscriber ports, connection ports

and service ports to the channels of the central
switching network and which are each controlled by

a group processor (GP)

on the basis of which

c) the connection request is passed automatically
from the A-end group processor to that channel of

the central switching network via which the
announcement is passed,
d) for this purpose, the switching time (ESa),
determined for an announcement request, relating

to a common announcement port is passed on from
the co-ordination processor to the group

processor.
