<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a surgical instrument and specifically is a device for delivering embolic coils to a selected site within the vasculature of the human body via use of a catheter. In particular, the device involves an embolic coil having a radially enlarged member attached to one end, which coil is released by forcing the radially enlarged member axially through a distendible aperture situated on the distal end of a pusher assembly. Alternatively, the embolic coils may be mounted on a guidewire and a pusher sheath within the catherter lumen used to push through the coils through the end of the catheter lumen. The catheter has a constricted distal tip or other means of frictionally controlling the release of embolic coils. Additionally (or alternatively), the guidewire may engage the embolic coils from their interior to allow precise placement of the coils.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is an embolic coil and
a device for delivering embolic coils to
a selected site within the vasculature of the human body
via use of a catheter. In particular, the device
involves an embolic coil having a radially enlarged
member attached to one end, which coil is released by
forcing the radially enlarged member axially through a
distendible aperture situated on the distal end of a
pusher assembly. The endovascular treatment of a variety of
vascular maladies throughout the body is an increasingly
more important form of therapy. Catheters have been used
to place various treatment materials, devices, and drugs
within arteries and veins in the human body. Examples of
these devices and their use in such treatments are shown
in U.S. Patent No. 5,234,437 ("Detachable
Pusher-Vasoocclusive Coil Assembly with Threaded
Coupling").
This document shows methods and
devices for delivery of coils or wires within the human
body to sites such as aneurysms, to occlude those sites.
Coils such as are discussed in this document (as
well as in U.S. Patent No. 4,994,069), may be of a
regular or helical configuration or may assume a random
convoluted configuration at the site. The coils normally
are made of a radiopaque, biocompatible metal such as
platinum, gold, tungsten, or alloys of these and other
metals. In treating an aneurysm it is common to place a
number of coils within the aneurysm. The coils occlude
the site by posing a physical barrier to blood flow and
by promoting thrombus formation at the site.Coils have typically been placed at the desired
site within the vasculature using a catheter and a
pusher. The site is first accessed by the catheter. In
treating peripheral or neural conditions requiring
occlusion, the sites are accessed with flexible, small
diameter catheters such as those shown in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,739,768 and 4,813,934 may be used. The catheter
may be guided to the site through the use of guidewires
(see U.S. Patent No. 4,884,579) or by the use flow-directed
means such as balloons placed at the distal end
of the catheter. Use of guidewires involves the 
placement of relatively long, torqueable proximal wire
sections within the catheter attached to more flexible
distal end wire sections designed to be advanced across
sharp bends at vessel junctions. The guidewire is
visible using x-ray and allows a catheter to be placed in
vessels taking extremely tortuous paths, even when those
vessel are surrounded by soft tissue such as the brain.Once the chosen site has been reached, the
catheter

<CLAIMS>
A detachable embolic coil (102) comprising a coil
having ends and an outer diameter, characterized by an enlarged member (104)

fixedly attached to one of said ends, the enlarged member
having an outer diameter which is larger than the outer

diameter of the coil.
The coil of claim 1, wherein the enlarged member
(104) is a ball.
The coil of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the coil
material is selected from platinum, gold, tungsten, or

alloys of these.
The coil of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the coil
material is a polymer.
The coil of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the coil
material is carbon fibre.
The coil of any one of the preceding claims wherein
the coil (102) is helical, random, or straight.
A pusher-coil assembly (100) for use in occluding a
selected site within a vessel, the assembly comprising:


(a) a coil (102) of the construction claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims, wherein the enlarged member

(104) is fixedly attached to the coil's proximal end;
(b) a pusher housing (106) having a socket (108) at
its distal end, said socket having a throat aperture

diameter smaller than the diameter of the enlarged member
(104) fixedly attached to the coil (102); and
(c) a plunger (112) located within the pusher
housing (106) that is axially movable relative to the

pusher housing and coil (102) from a first position to a
second position which pushes the coil and the enlarged

member (104) through the socket throat (110) and thus
uncouples the coil from the pusher housing.
The assembly of claim 7, wherein the distal socket
end is slotted.
The assembly of claim 7, wherein the socket throat is
grooved.
The assembly of any one of claims 7 to 9,
additionally comprising a pusher wire (114).
The assembly of claim 10, additionally comprising
means for advancing the pusher wire (114) and its plunger

head (112).
