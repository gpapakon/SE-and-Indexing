<ABSTRACT>
A two-part container closure, consisting of a cap part (10), which can be fixed on the container and has a passage opening, and a rocker lever which is fastened on the cap part so as to be pivotable between a first and a second position by means of a bearing arrangement and has a passage aligned with the passage opening of the cap part in the first position of the rocker lever, whereas the passage opening in the second position of the rocker lever is sealed off by the latter, the bearing arrangement comprising a pair of bearing journals which protrude on both sides of the rocker lever and engage in bearing depressions (23), aligned with said bearing journals, with tapered insertion openings (24) on the opposite side walls of a recess (11) in which the rocker lever is essentially held in the second position. The bearing arrangement furthermore comprises complementary catch projections and catch hollows (29), which are aligned with one another and can be brought into locking engagement with one another, on the bearing journals and bearing depressions (23) respectively, thus forming the axis of rotation about which the rocker lever can be pivoted. Each bearing depression (23) is formed at least along a part of its circumference by a web-shaped moulding (27), extending from the insertion opening (24), on the side wall (13) of the recess (11).

A two-part closure for a container consisting of a cap 
part (10) which can be secured to the container and which 

includes an aperture (16), and a rocker arm (100) mounted by 
means of a bearing arrangement on the cap part and adapted to 

be pivoted between a first and second position, said rocker 
arm comprising a through passage (106) aligned with the 

aperture in the cap part in the first position of the rocker 
arm whereas, in the second position of the rocker arm, the 

aperture is sealed thereby, said bearing arrangement (23, 
102) comprising a pair of journal trunnions (102) projecting 

from opposite sides of the rocker arm and engaging in journal 
sockets (23) aligned therewith and having restricted 

insertion apertures (24), said journal sockets being formed 
on opposing side walls (13) of a recess (11), said rocker arm 

being substantially accommodated in said recess in the second 
position thereof, each socket being formed along at least a 

portion of its periphery by a web-like projection (27) formed 
on the side wall of the recess and extending from the 

insertion aperture, characterised in that, said bearing 
arrangement (23, 102) comprises complementary latching 

projections (105) and latching depressions (29) provided on 
said journal trunnions (102) or journal sockets (23)  

 
respectively, said latching projections and latching 

depressions being mutually aligned and adapted to be brought 
into latching engagement with one another and forming the 

rotational axis about which the rocker arm (100) is adapted 
to be pivoted. 
The closure in accordance with Claim 1, characterised 
in that the web-like projection (27) is provided essentially 

only along a peripheral region of the socket (23) adjacent to 
an inner end wall (15) of the recess (11) of the cap part 

(10), and that a space (28) is provided between the web-like 
projection and the inner end wall, an end section (104) of a 

cover plate (103) provided on the rocker arm (100) can be 
accommodated in the first position thereof in said space, 

said cover plate being adapted to outwardly cover at least a 
part of the recess (11) in the cap part (10) including the 

bearing arrangement (23, 102) in the second position of the 
rocker arm. 
The closure in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in 
that the cover plate (103) is extended up to a manual 

operating edge (108) of a base part (107) of the rocker arm 
(100) including the through passage (106).
