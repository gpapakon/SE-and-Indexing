<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the activation level of platelets and other types of blood cells that undergo activation by ELISA and other immunosassay techniques includes the step of reacting a sample containing the blood cells in a liquid phase with an excess quantity of an activation-specific primary antibody prior to allowing the cells in the sample to bind to a solid surface. This differs from typical ELISA proceduces, wherein the cells are bound to the surface of a plastic test tube or microtiter plate prior to addition of the primary antibody. It has been discovered according to the invention that binding the cells to a surface prior to reaction with the primary antibody changes the activation level of the cells, making the assay less accurate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOASSAY FOR DETERMINING BLOOD CELL ACTIVATIONTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an immunoassay, particularly an enzyme-linked im unoabsorbent assay (ELISA) for monitoring activation of platelets and other types of blood cells which undergo activation.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the past five years, the use of fluorescent-activated flow cytometry with specific activating antibodies has allowed investigators to directly monitor platelet activation and subsequent microaggregate formation. While accurate and specific, flow cytometry is extremely expensive, requiring an expensive machine and maintenance, and a dedicated technician. Platelet assay methods using other well- known assay systems, such as ELISA, radioimmunoassay(RIA) and Western blot analysis have been described in Berman et al., Methods in Enzvmoloqy 169:314, 1989. Berman et al. discuss an ELISA assay which involves fixing platelets and placing the fixed platelets directly in a microtiter plate for the purpose of screening for activation specific antibodies.Current assays for monitoring platelet activation in patients who may be at risk for thrombosis or thrombosis-related conditions involve indirect assessment of this activation by measuring systemic released platelet products (factors present in the circulation) . Such products include platelet 

factor 4 and Î²-thromboglobulin, or the thromboxane B2, a stable product of platelet activating factor thromboxane A . Unfortunately, circulating levels of these factors can undergo metabolically-produced changes, and as such these factors are considered indirect measures of platelet activation. As such, a need remains for a direct platelet activation assay which can be carried out on patient samples without undue complexity or expense.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONA method according to the invention for determining the activation level of blood cells by an i munoassay of the type wherein a primary antibody undergoes specific binding with the blood cells and a labelled secondary antibody undergoes specific binding with the primary antibody-blood cell comple r such as ELISA, includes the step of reacting a sample containing the blood cells in a liquid phase, e.g. an aqueous suspension, with an excess quantity of an activation-specific primary antibody prior to allowing the cells in the sample to bind to a solid surface. This differs from typical ELISA procedures, wherein the cells are bound to the surface of a plastic test tube or microtiter plate prior to addition of the primary antibody. It
