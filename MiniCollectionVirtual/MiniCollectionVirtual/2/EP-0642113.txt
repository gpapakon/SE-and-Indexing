<ABSTRACT>
To compensate for the variation of the transmission-voltage characteristic 
curve due to temperature changes in a ferro-electric display device, the display device is 

provided with one or more measuring elements (5) for measuring the polarization 
current. The drive voltages are corrected by means of the polarization current which is 

used as a feedback parameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display device comprising a ferro-electric 
electro-optical medium between two supporting plates, a first supporting plate of which 
comprises one or more selection electrodes for presenting a selection voltage and a 
second supporting plate comprises one or more electrodes which, together with 
electrodes on the first supporting plate and the electro-optical medium therebetween, 
define pixels. Display devices of this type are used in, for example display apparatuses 
for (personal) computers and for video applications. A display device of the type described above, in which a ferro-electric 
liquid crystal is used as a display medium, described in USP 5,047,758 (PHN 12.352), 
in which also a suitable drive mode is used. A problem of using this type of display devices is the temperature 
dependence of the transmission-voltage characteristic (the relation between the voltage 
applied across a pixel and the associated optical transmission) of the pixels in such a 
display device. Said temperature dependence appears to depend also on the 
preprocessing operations to which these types of display devices are subjected (the 
"temperature history"). In the completed state, when the effects of this temperature history (for 
example, each time after switch-on) have been eliminated as much as possible, a shift of 
the transmission-voltage characteristic may also occur. Such shifts may be approximately 100-2000 mV at one given temperature, 
dependent on the temperature history of the display device. Since it must be possible to adjust a large number of grey scale stages 
(approximately 100) over a total width of this characteristic which may be of the order 
of 4 V, even after said preprocessing treatments have been performed, a shift of 40 mV 
corresponds to approximately one grey scale stage. Consequently, display devices of this type are not readily suitable for  
 
displaying grey levels. Display devices which switch only between two extreme states (for 
example, black-white) may lose contrast due to this variation of the transmission-voltage 
characteristic curve. It is an object of the present invention to provide a display device of the 
type described in the opening paragraph in which the adjustment is insensitive or not 
very sensitive to temperatures. Such a display device is characterized in that it is provided, at the area of 
the electro-optical medium, with measuring electrodes arranged opposite each other on 
the first and second supporting plates and with a measuring
