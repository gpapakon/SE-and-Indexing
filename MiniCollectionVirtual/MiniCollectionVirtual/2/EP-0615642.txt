<ABSTRACT>
A monitoring method, such as a time and/or passage monitoring method, in which individuals, such as physical persons, make contact with a stamping unit (2) and therewith supply information to the unit, in which the information is preferably compiled. The method is mainly characterized by arranging existing units (2, 3) in a decentralized system in which each unit (2, 3) is separated physically from remaining units; and is further characterized in that each individual himself carries an updatable information carrier (4) which includes unique information personal to the individual concerned, wherein updating of the information carrier can be effected upon contact with a stamping unit. The invention also relates to a system for carrying out the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a monitoring
method for effecting time and/or passage checks for instance,
in which individuals, such as physical persons,
by contact with a so-called stamping unit, supply information
to said unit in which the information is preferably
compiled.The invention also relates to a system for carrying
out the method.Methods and systems essentially of this kind
are known to the art. Two principal types of such systems
exist.A first of these systems includes a stamping
machine, in which all persons clock-in and clock-out, so
as to record the times at which such persons come and
go. This system has a number of natural limitations,
such as the number of persons clocking in and out, local
systems which exclude the possibility of clocking in and
out on some other machine or at some other place, reliability
in operation, etc. These systems often consist of
one single unit which integrates the stamping or clocking
mechanism and calculating computer. A documentation
printer or writer is normally connected to this unit. Person
identification is normally effected with the aid of CR-80
cards provided with a magnetic strip. This type of
identification process also applies to passage control
systems for a lone door.The other type of system referred to includes
several stamping stations where people clock in and
out, these stamping stations being mutually connected
by means of a physical cable or by radio links, for instance.
Although such systems overcome some of the
drawbacks encountered with the first type of system, the
cost of the cabling and of system maintenance is normally
very high. Furthermore, the system requires the
central equipment to be always dimensioned for the correct
volumes of active features of the system, schedules,
storage capacity for the numbers clocking in and
out, etc. The system is comprised of a plurality of free-standing
stamping or registering units which are connected
to a central computer. In turn, this computer is
normally connected to a personal computer in which the
final computations are made and information is presented.
The centrally-controlled passage monitoring system
suffers precisely the same problems as the other type
of system.Thus, the known systems always have given
limitations and when obtaining the system, the user
must determine both structure and volumes. Although
the user is able to change both structure and volumes
after making the system operational, each change results
in further volume limitations, while a change in the
structure of
