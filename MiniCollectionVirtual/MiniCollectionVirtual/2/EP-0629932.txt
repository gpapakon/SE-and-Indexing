<ABSTRACT>
Timepiece with a date indicator (1) with internal toothing moving angularly one notch each day, at least one rotary indicating means (12) driven by the said date indicator and intended to indicate cyclic parameters such as the date, the lunar phase, the "cash balance", etc. Several types of indication, all controlled by the date indicator, make it possible to produce a panoply of watches, of simple construction, with various display combinations.

<CLAIMS>
Timepiece comprising a date indicator (1) with an inner toothing, 
moving angularly by one step per day, and at least one rotary indicating means 

(12) driven by said date indicator,
 
   characterised in that said at least one rotary indicating means (12) and 

said date indicator (1) are disposed concentrically,
 
   and in that said at least one rotary indicating means (12) is driven by the 

agency of at least one intermediate rotary element (8) which meshes directly on 
said inner toothing of said date indicator (1). 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterised in that said at least one 
rotary indicating means (12) is a hand indicating the date. 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterised in that said at least one 
rotary indicating means (12) is a rotary disk reproducing the evolution of the 

lunar cycle. 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterised in that said at least one 
rotary indicating means (12) is a hand indicating the "cash balance". 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterised in that said at least one 
rotary indicating means (12) is a hand indicating the number of the week in the 

month. 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterised in that said at least one 
rotary indicating means (12) is a hand indicating the number of the week in the 

year. 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims characterised in 
that the dial (13) comprises an aperture (17) allowing the indications (7; 7a) 

inscribed on the date indicator (1) to appear. 
Timepiece according to claim 7, characterised in that said indication 
(7) is the date.  

 
Timepiece according to claim 7, characterised in that said indication 
(7a) is the "cash balance". 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the teeth (2) of the inner toothing of the date indicator (1) ) are both driven 

and driving. 
Timepiece according to claim 10, characterised in that the teeth (2) 
of the inner toothing are driven by the wheels (3, 4). 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that it comprises a clearance (A) between the tooth (2) situated downstream 

from the active tooth of the control star (8) and this latter tooth, this clearance 
being present when the date indicator (1) ) is in immobile resting position. 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that it comprises a clearance (B) between the tooth (2) situated upstream from 

the active tooth of the control star (8) and this latter tooth, this clearance being 
present when the date indicator (1) ) is in immobile resting position. 
Timepiece according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that it comprises a plurality of independent rotary indicating means (12), each 

indicating a different parameter. 
Timepiece according to one of the claims 1 to 13, characterised in 
that it comprises a plurality of dependent rotary indicating means (12), each 

indicating a different parameter.
