<ABSTRACT>
A demoulding emulsion for releasing concrete from a mould is provided. The emulsion comprises from 145 to 200 parts by weight of water, from 7 to 35 parts by weight of a fatty acid ester having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the fatty acid radical, from 2 to 13 parts by weight of a dialkyl ether having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms per alkyl radical, from 1 to 10 parts by weight of a fatty alcohol having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms and from 0 to 4 parts by weight of a fatty acid amide having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. The demoulding emulsion has the advantage that, on the one hand, it leads to a concrete body having excellent surface quality and, on the other hand, ensures that after demoulding the concrete body the surface of the mould is free of undesired deposits.
