<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for 
preparations of basic drugs which taste unpleasant. More 
specifically, it relates to a composition for oral 
preparations, which is excellent in masking unpleasantly 
tasting basic drugs and has excellent performance in 
biological use. There have been hitherto found a variety of methods for 
masking the tastes of unpleasantly tasting drugs. For 
example, JP-A-49-81526 discloses a method in which macrolide 
is dissolved in an inert volatile organic solvent in which a 
coating polymer selected from the group consisting of 
polyvinylacetal diethylaminoacetate (hereinafter abbreviated 
as AEA), cellulose acetate dibutylaminohydroxypropyl ether, 
Eudragit® E and ethyl cellulose and at least one member 
selected from the group consisting of wax, higher fatty acid 
and salt insoluble in higher fatty acid have been dissolved 
or dispersed, the resultant solution is spray-dried to form 
coated macrolide particles, and the coated macrolides 
particles are recovered. Further, as a pharmaceutical mixture for masking the 
taste of unpleasantly tasting basic drugs, for example, U.S. 
Patent 4,656,027 disclose a dry powder for use as a 
pharmaceutical preparation, which dry powder is prepared by  
 
mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable basic substance with a 
bad tasting pharmaceutical which is in a form insoluble at 
high pH and encapsulating the mixture. U.S. Patent 4,994,260 discloses a pharmaceutical 
preparation for controlled release of a pharmaceutically 
active substance, which masks bad taste and increases 
stability of the pharmaceutically active substance and 
contains an encapsulated active substance in combination 
with 60 to 99 % by wight of a release-controlling substance 
selected from the group consisting of polysaccharides, 
oligosaccarides, disaccharides, monosaccarides, polyhydroxy 
alcohols and mixtures thereof. For dissolving a conventional coating agent, howevere, 
there is used an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, 
chloroform, cyclohexane, carbon tetrachloride, methyl ethyl 
ketone, acetone, methyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. It is 
therefor required to carry out a drying step for removing 
the solvent. As a result, the coating is porous, and that 
the drying step extraordinarily requires time, facilities, 
labor and cost. Further, this step involves risks of 
ignition and explosion, and moreoever, a product might 
contain a residual solvent to have a detrimental effect on a 
human body. The present inventors have made an initial
