<ABSTRACT>
Processes and apparatuses of the abovementioned type in which the conversion takes place by melting within a glass-melting furnace, are known. It is disadvantageous in the prior art that dioxins and/or furans can form during the melting and can enter the environment along with the offgas. The novel process and the associated apparatus are more environmentally friendly. The essential features of the novel process are that the offgas is cooled, the resultant condensate is recycled into the melt, and the cold offgas is subjected to gas cleaning. In addition, the waste produced is refuse-combustion ash. In the novel process and the associated apparatus, only relatively harmless, small residual amounts of offgas are produced. The process and the apparatus are particularly suitable for disposing of refuse-combustion ash. Other wastes, such as filter dusts, fly ash, etc., can also be processed.
