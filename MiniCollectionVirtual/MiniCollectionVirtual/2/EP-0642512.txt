<DESCRIPTION>
 TRIAZOLOPYRIMIDINE HERBICIDESThe present invention relates to novel herbicidally active triazolopyrimidines, to their preparation, to compositions containing said compounds as active ingredients, and to the use thereof for controlling weeds, especially in crops of cultivated plants or for inhibiting plant growth.Herbicidally active triazolopyrimidines are known and disclosed, inter alia, in WO 90/12012 andUS-A-4209 621.Novel triazolopyrimidines having herbicidal and growth-regulating properties have now been found.Accordingly, the invention relates to compounds of formula IwhereinRj is hydrogen, C1-C alkyl or -C^haloalkyl; andR2 is C1-C4alkyl, C1-C haloalkyl, 

 Cj-C4haloalkoxy, C1-C4alkylthio,CrC4haloalkylthio, C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C alkyl, 
CrC4a-koxy-C1-C4alkylthio, halogen, amino, C1-C4alkylamino or C1-C4dialkylamino.Halogen substituents in the above definitions will be taken to mean fluoro or iodo, and preferably chloro and bromo.The alkyl groups occurring in the definitions of the substituents may be straight-chain or 

branched and are typically methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl. Methyl and ethyl are preferred. Such structural units may also occur in the following substituents.Haloalkyl will conveniently be alkyl groups that cany one or more, preferably one to five, identical or different halogen substituents, said halogen substituents being bromo or iodo and, preferably, fluoro and chloro. Illustrative examples of such groups are difluoro- methyl, chlorodifluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, l,l-dichloro-2,2,2-triflu- oroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl.Alkoxy is typically methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, sec-butoxy or tert-butoxy. Methoxy and ethoxy are preferred.Haloalkoxy is exemplified by difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy or 1 , 1 ,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy .Alkylthio is typically methylthio, ethylthio, n-propylthio, isopropylthio, n-butylthio, isobutylthio, sec-butylthio or tert-butylthio. Methylthio is preferred.Haloalkylthio will typically be difluoromethylthio, trifluoromethylthio, 2,2,2-trifluoroethylthio or 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethylthio. Difluoromethylthio and trifluoromethylthio are preferred.Alkoxyalkoxy will typically be methoxymethoxy, methoxyethoxy, ethoxymethoxy, ethoxyethoxy and propoxymethoxy. Methoxymethoxy is preferred.Alkoxyalkyl is typically methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, ethoxymethyl or ethoxyethyl. Methoxymethyl is preferred.Alkylamino is typically
