<ABSTRACT>
An improved control method for an electronically controlled
variable displacement refrigerant compressor (12), where the control

has normal and high speed displacement control modes, with smooth
transitions between such control modes. The displacement control

mechanism is in the form of a solenoid valve (28), and the valve is
pulse-width-modulated (PWM) at a variable duty cycle to regulate

displacement of the compressor (12). When the compressor (12) is
operating in a normal speed range, a first control mode determines a

normal PWM duty cycle (PID_DC) to satisfy cooling demand; when
the compressor is operating in a high speed range, a second control

mode determines an alternate PWM duty cycle (DC
min
) based on
compressor speed (CS). The solenoid valve (28) is operated in

accordance with the duty cycle corresponding to the lower
displacement. A smooth transition from the normal control mode to

the high speed control mode is achieved by scheduling the alternate
duty cycle as a function of compressor speed (CS). Once in the high

speed control mode, the parameters of the first control mode are
adjusted so that the normal duty cycle (PID_DC) matches the

alternate duty cycle (DC
min
). This ensures a smooth transition from
the high speed control mode to the normal control mode when the

compressor speed (CS) falls back into the normal speed range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control method for an electronically
controlled variable displacement refrigerant compressor that is
mechanically driven by a motor vehicle engine, where the
displacement is controlled in a normal mode or a high speed mode.Variable displacement refrigerant compressors have been
utilized in automotive air conditioning systems, with the
displacement regulated in accordance with cooling demand via either
a hydraulic control valve or solenoid control valve. In a typical
arrangement, the compressor includes one or more pistons coupled to
a variable angle wobble plate or swash plate, and the control valve
adjusts a differential pressure acting on a wobble plate control
mechanism to vary the wobble plate angle, and hence the compressor
displacement. In the control of such a compressor, it has been found
that the compressor durability can be improved without significant
loss of cooling during high speed operation of the engine by
overriding the normal displacement control and de-stroking the
compressor to reduce its displacement to a lower value. By way of
example, a hydraulic de-stroking implementation is disclosed in the generic
U.S. Patent No. 5,071,321, and electronic de-stroking
implementations are disclosed in the U.S. Patent Nos. 4,606,705 and
5,145,326.A drawback with known controls of the type described above is
that the transition between normal and high-speed displacement 
control modes is abrupt and tends to produce disturbances in the
compressor and the engine powertrain. These disturbances are
undesired for reasons of both durability and driveability.
Accordingly, what is desired is a dual mode control that minimizes
disturbances to the compressor and engine powertrain when
transitioning from one control mode to the other.The present invention is directed to an improved control
method for an electronically controlled variable displacement
refrigerant compressor, where the control has normal and high speed
displacement control modes, with smooth transitions between such
control modes.In a preferred embodiment, the displacement control
mechanism is in the form of a solenoid valve, and the valve is pulse-width-modulated
(PWM) at a variable duty cycle to regulate a
displacement control pressure within the compressor. When the
compressor is operating in a normal speed range, a first control
determines a normal PWM duty cycle based on cooling demand;
when the compressor is operating in a high speed range, a second
control determines an alternate PWM duty cycle based on
compres
