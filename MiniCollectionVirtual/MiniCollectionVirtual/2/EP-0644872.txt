<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutically active cyclic aminooxy 
compounds, processes for the preparation of these compounds, pharmaceutical 
compositions comprising these compounds, these compounds for use in a prophylactic, 
therapeutic or diagnostic method for the treatment of the human or animal body, and the 
use of these compounds for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of the human or 
animal body and for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. According to the current state of knowledge, participation of the polyamines spermidine 
and spermine and the diamine putrescine in regulation of growth processes is to be 
assumed. A number of cell functions can be favourably influenced by inhibition of polyamine 
biosynthesis. The enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is one of the key enzymes of polyamine 
biosynthesis. A reduction in the activity of ODC leads to a reduced polyamine 
biosynthesis and therefore to reduced polyamine levels in the cell. If inhibition of the 
activity of this enzyme by ODC inhibitors is achieved, the polyamine concentration in 
mammalian cells (including human cells) can be influenced, i.e. lowered, with the aid of 
such ODC inhibitors. In mammalian cells, ODC catalyses the synthesis of putrescine, a diamine which at the 
same time is also an intermediate in polyamine biosynthesis. EP-A-0 369 944 describes oxadiaminobutane compounds which inhibit the activity of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylate. EP-A-0 495 750 describes heterocycle aminoxy compounds which also inhibit the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. It has now been found, surprisingly, that the compounds of the present invention which 
have a cyclic central constituent have advantageous pharmacological properties. The compounds according to the invention are those of the formula I 
H2N-(CH2)n-A-(CH2)m-O-NH2  
 
in which 
the radical A is C3-C6cycloalkylene; n is 0 or 1 and, independently thereof, m is 0 or 1;  
with the provisos that a) the distance between the aminooxy radical H2N-O- and the amino 
group -NH2 is at least 3 and not more than 4 carbon atoms and that b) the two radicals 
H2N-(CH2)n- and -(CH2)m-O-NH2 are not bonded to the same ring carbon atom of A, and 
salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention can exist as mixtures of cis and trans isomers or, 
preferably, as pure cis or pure trans isomers; if asymmetric carbon atoms are present (i.e. 
if A is other than 1,4-cyclohexylene or 1,3-cyclobutylene), these carbon atoms can be in 
the (R), (S) or (R,S) configuration,
