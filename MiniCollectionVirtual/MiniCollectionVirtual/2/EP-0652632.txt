<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power supply for a vibrating
compressor, having an inverter with at least one switching
element for converting d-c into a-c and a d-c power source
section for applying a d-c voltage to said inverter, a
current detecting means for detecting a current flowing in
the vibrating compressor and a control section having a
frequency following circuit and an inverter control
circuit.An increasing number of cooling units using vibrating
compressors have been installed on automobiles. In the
cooling unit, the d-c power of an automobile, that is, a
car battery, is used as the drive source of the vibrating
compressor. The vibrating compressor has such a
construction that a drive coil caused to vibrate in a
magnetic field by an alternating current fed from the
outside drives the piston.In a conventional type of power supply for vibrating
compressors using a car battery, for example, as the drive
source, where the mechanical resonance frequency of a
vibrating compressor is predetermined by its contruction,
an a-c voltage of a fixed frequency is generated on the
basis of the battery voltage and fed to the vibrating
compressor.Since the resonance frequency of the vibrating compressor,
however, varies with changes in load, or the service
environment, the conventional construction where the power
frequency to be fed to the vibrating compressor is kept
constant tends to result in poor efficiency. A control method with good efficiency is desired
particularly for applications where a battery is used as
the drive source.The preamble of claim 1 acknowledges the prior art known
from the Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application
No. Sho-61(1986)-173676 (PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN,
unexamined applications, E field, vol. 10, no. 384,
December 23, 1986 THE PATENT OFFICE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT
page 56E 466; & JP-A-61 173 676 (SAWAFUJI ELECTRIC)) where
the vibrating compressor is driven by always keeping it
under the optimum condition by causing the vibrating
period of the electrical vibrating system in the vibrating compressor to agree with the natural vibrating period of
the mechanical vibrating system.It was experimentally revealed that efficient driving is
realized when the difference in first and second peaks of
the input current waveform is a certain value.In more detail this power supply has an inverter for
converting d-c into a-c, said vibrating compressor is
driven by an a-c voltage of a frequency agreeing with the
resonance frequency of said vibrating compressor and said
power supply
