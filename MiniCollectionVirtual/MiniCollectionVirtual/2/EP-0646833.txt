of photosensitive web (A) to a photoprinter has a housing 


12
 characterized in that an interior compartment 
14
 and a 
removably mounted shaft 
32
 for supporting the rolls of 
web (A). A top wall 
24
 is removably mounted to the 
housing 
12
 in a light-lock relationship and includes a 
openable member 
100
 for accessing the interior 
compartment 
14
. Slot-like openings 
80
, in communications 
with the interior compartment 
14
, provide paths for 
delivering strips of photosensitive web 
70
 from the 
interior compartment 
14
. In another embodiment, a method 
for loading rolls of photosensitive web (A) into the 

package 
10
 above includes removing the shaft 
32
 and 
loading thereon the rolls of photosensitive web (A). The 

shaft 
32
 supporting the rolls of photosensitive web (A) 
is then inserted into the opening 
27
 of the housing 
12
 
and the top wall 
24
 is remounted onto the top edge 
25

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the packaging of rolls
of web. More particularly, the invention concerns
packages and a method for storing and delivering multiple
rolls of photosensitive web having very great lengths.Photoprinters adapted to receive rolls of
photosensitive web directly from an external supply
generally require mateable packages capable of providing
several fairly lengthy rolls of photosensitive web to the
system for continuous high volume printing. An existing
package system described in document WO91/19222
based on document FR2663007
can accommodate eight 1800 m (6000 foot) rolls of
photosensitive web at a time. Moreover, the existing
package is designed to be end loaded from a slitter by
the photographic paper manufacturer, closed and then
shipped loaded to the photofinisher. When the
photographic paper supply is exhausted, the photofinisher
must return the empty package to the photographic paper
manufacturer for reloading.Shortcomings of the existing package therefore
include its inability to accommodate more lengthy rolls
of photosensitive web as well as a greater number of
rolls of web. Thus, photoprinter system uptime is at
least partially adversely affected by the limited
capacity of the existing package. Moreover, another
problem with the existing package is that it cannot be
conveniently loaded by the photofinisher and, therefore,
must be returned to the photographic paper manufacturer
for reloading. Additionally, to withstand the rigors of
transportation, the existing package must be of rugged
construction. Further, the prior art package is limited
to a substantially cylindrical shape to minimize 
condensation damage to the photosensitive rolls of web
resulting from differing temperatures during shipment.
Since relative humidity is an important factor in
maintaining the quality of photosensitive web, the
cylindrical shaped existing package provides a path for
condensation to roll down the side walls of the package
and not drip on the photosensitive web. Importantly,
conventional packages for rolls of photosensitive web are
limited in their capacity to hold large rolls of web
(that is, very much greater than 1800 m (6000 feet)). Moreover,
because the existing package rests on a pallet at the
photofinisher's for the convenience of the shipping
process, it cannot be easily maneuvered by the
photofinisher without the aid of a lift device, such as a
fork lift.Although only remotely pertinent, packages for
individual photosensitive web rolls fitted with a light-tight
slot through which the

A package (10) for storing rolls of photosensitive web and delivering strips of web to a
photoprinter, the package comprising :


a housing (12) comprising an interior compartment (14) having a bottom wall
(26) supporting upstanding first and second opposed end walls (20, 22) and

sidewalls (16, 18), the first and second end walls (20, 22) and sidewalls (16, 18)
defining a top edge (25) surrounding an opening (27);
a shaft (32) positionable in the interior compartment (14) through the opening
(27) for supporting at least one roll of photosensitive web, the shaft (32) being

removably mounted to the first and second opposite end walls (20, 22);
a to wall (24) removably mounted to the top edge (25) of the housing (12);
means
on the top edge and on the top wall for light-locking the housing ;
slot-like openings (80) in communication with the interior compartment, each opening providing a path for

delivering a strip of photosensitive web from the interior compartment ;

characterized in that the package further comprises :

a plurality of casters (34) mounted for rotation for positioning the housing
with respect to the photoprinter ;
an openable member (100)
connected by attachement means to the top wall, the openable member comprising a

first half-slot portion (82) cooperating with a second half-slot portion on the
top wall for forming the slot-like openings when it is in a closed position;
the first and second opposed end walls (20, 22) being provided with first and
second plate-like members (60, 66) which have a first and second grooved

portions, respectively, for supporting the end portions (33, 35) of the shaft (32), the
grooved portions each being conformed to only receive one of the end portions

(33, 35).
The package recited in claim 1 wherein the light locking means comprises a continuous channel (28) in the top edge
and

a continuous lip portion (23) in the top wall which snugly fits into the continuous
channel, the channei being lined with a compressible material.
The package recited in claim 1 wherein means (44) are provided for spatially separating
two or more rolls of photosensitive web on the shaft so as to prevent damaging of

adjacent photosensitive rolls of web.
The package recited in claim 1 wherein the housing is further characterized in that
means (44) are provided for positioning a roll of photosensitive web in correspondence with one of the slot-like openings at a time for

delivering a strip of photosensitive web.
The package recited in claim 4 comprising package positioning means which comprises a
retractable locating pin member (204) affixed to the housing and a guide track

(202) on the floor, the guide track comprising a plurality of mateable holes (203)
for receiving the locating pin member, each mateable hole corresponding to a

photosensitive web delivery position with respect to the photoprinter.
