<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data output circuit, 
and more specifically to a data output circuit suitable for 
use when driven by a single low voltage supply. Fig. 7 is a circuit diagram showing a data output 
circuit related to the present invention. In Fig. 7, an 
output buffer circuit composed of a P-channel transistor 
11 and an N-channel transistor 12 is connected to output 
terminals of an internal circuit 1 formed in a semiconductor 
chip. From the internal circuit 1, two same-phase 
drive signals d and d' are outputted to the gates of the 
P-channel transistor 11 and the N-channel transistor 12, 
respectively to drive the output buffer circuit. These 
transistors 11 and 12 are connected in series between a 
supply voltage (VDD) terminal and a ground voltage (VSS) 
terminal, and the drains of the two transistors 11 and 12 
are connected in common to an output terminal Dout. When the drive signals d and d' are outputted from the 
internal circuit 1 to the gates of these two transistors 
11 and 12, since any one of the two transistors 11 and 12 
is turned on, a high-level or a low-level signal is 
outputted from the output terminal Dout. In this data output circuit, however, when a voltage 
higher than the supply voltage VDD is applied to the output 
terminal Dout, a through current I₁ flows from the output 
terminal Dout to the supply voltage (VDD) terminal through 
the P-channel transistor 11. Fig. 9 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing 
a part of the data output circuit show in Fig. 7. In Fig. 
9, an n-type well 72 is formed on the surface of a p-type 
semiconductor substrate 71, and further a source region 73 
and a drain region 74 of P⁺ type impurity region are formed 
in the n-type well 72. Here, the above-mentioned through  
 
current I₁ flows from the output terminal Dout into the n-type 
well 72 through the drain region 74. Further, in the circuit as shown in Fig. 7, when a 
high-level signal is outputted, it is necessary to charge 
the output terminal Dout through the P-channel transistor 
11. In this circuit, however, since the current drive 
capability of the P-channel transistor is lower than that 
of the N-channel transistor, there exists a problem in that 
the data output speed is lowered. Fig. 8 is a circuit diagram showing another data output 
circuit related to the present invention. In Fig. 8, the 
P-channel transistor 11 shown in Fig. 7 is replaced with 
an N-channel transistor 21. Therefore, from the internal 
circuit 1, two opposite-phase drive signals d and
