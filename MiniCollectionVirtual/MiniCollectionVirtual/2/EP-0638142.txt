<ABSTRACT>
Device for converting wind flow energy into mechanical energy, having a base construction (4) and a rotor (8) having a number of rotor blades (20; 20a) which are connected to an annular rotary support (18) and extend essentially in a plane through the axis of rotation (14) of the support. The wind-braking area of the rotor (8) is adjustable. Each rotor blade (20; 20a) or a part thereof is hingedly connected to the rotor support (18) for setting the rotor blade or part thereof in a predetermined lengthwise orientation at a predetermined distance relative to the axis of rotation (14) of the support by moving the rotor blade or part thereof in a plane through the axis of rotation. The rotor blades (20; 20a) may be directly hingeably connected to the rotor support (18), or by means of an arm assembly (17; 22; 24). The rotor blades are made up of a number of elongated parts (74, 76, 78; 92) for varying the effective length of the blades.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for converting 
wind flow energy into mechanical energy, comprising a base 
construction and a rotor with an essentially horizontal 
axis mounted on the base construction, the rotor having a 
number of elongated rotor blades which are connected to a 
rotary support and extend essentially radially therefrom, 
each rotor blade or a part thereof being connected to the 
rotor support by a hinge connection for tilting the 
longitudinal axis of the rotor blade or part thereof to a 
predetermined orientation relative to the axis of rotation 
of the support. Such a device is known from German Patent NÂ° 647 287, 
which describes a windmill having a hinge connection 
between a rotor blade and the rotary support with a hinge 
axis extending at rights angles both to the longitudinal 
axis of the rotor blade and to the axis of rotation of the 
support. By pivoting the rotor blades or parts thereof from 
a position in which they are essentially at right angles to 
the wind direction to an orientation in which they are at a 
small angle or parallel to the wind direction, the wind-braking 
area of the rotor can be adjusted to the actual 
wind speed. The object of the invention is to provide a device 
in which the wind-braking area of the rotor and the 
effective length of the rotor blades is adjustable, and 
which has a simpler construction compared to prior art 
devices, with relatively few component parts. To reach this aim, the device according to the 
invention is characterised in that a hinge axis of the 
hinge connection between a rotor blade and the rotary 
support is directed at an acute angle both to the 
longitudinal axis of the rotor blade and to the axis of 
rotation of the support. In this way, the angular position of a rotor blade 
with respect to its longitudinal axis is changed  
 
simultaneously with setting a tilted orientation of the 
rotor blade to bring the rotor blade out of the wind. The 
maximum wind-braking area, to be used at relatively low 
wind speeds, is achieved when the rotor blades are at right 
angles to the wind direction, while pivoting the rotor 
blades away in the wind direction and pivoting the rotor 
blades around their longitudinal axes results in a lower 
wind-braking area to be used a relatively high wind speeds. Since the part of a windmill rotor blade which is 
facing away from the axis of rotation of the rotor is most 
effective for generating power, in another preferred 
embodiment the support of the rotor is hingedly connected 
to each
