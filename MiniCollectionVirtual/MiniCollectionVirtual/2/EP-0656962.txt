<ABSTRACT>
Spun yarns are made at high speeds of up to 220 meters per minute, using spinning techniques in which air is used to twist the fibers of a three component blend, one component of which consists of staple fibers made from electrically conductive filaments having a denier no greater than 2.5 times the denier of the filaments of the other components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention
pertains is spun yarn. The invention is more specifically
directed to a process for making such yarn from a
three-component blend of staple fibers using high speed,
air spinning techniques with spinning speeds in excess of
70 meters per minute. In a preferred embodiment these
speeds can range from 150 to 220 meters per minute.The fiber blend used in the process is formed
from a plurality of selected filaments. One component of
the blend comprises staple fibers made from filaments
having an electrically conductive carbon black core and a
sheath of non-conductive polymer. The other two
components, which are heat-resistant, are preferably
formed from filaments of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide)
and of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide).The linear densities of the electrically conductive
sheath core filaments are no greater than 2.5 times the
deniers of the other filaments. This helps prevent or
lessens their migration to the surface of the spun yarn
during the spinning operation and thereby improves the
appearance of the yarn and of the fabrics woven from such
yarn.In the process of this invention, staple
fibers formed from electrically conductive first component
filaments having a carbon black core are blended with
heat-resistant staple fibers, prior to spinning, to impart
desired antistatic properties to a fabric or garment made
from such fibers.The invention specifically relates to a process for
making spun yarn from a blend of staple fibers formed from a
plurality of first, second and third component filaments,
wherein the first component is comprised of staple fibers
having an electrically conductive carbon black core and a 
sheath of a non-conductive polymer and the second and third
components are comprised of heat-resistant staple fibers, and
wherein the conductive filaments have been co-crimped in tow
form with non-conductive filaments prior to being processed
into staple fibers, comprising forming the blend of staple
fibers into a sliver, and spinning the sliver into a spun
yarn, characterized by
   using spinning techniques wherein a fluid is used to
twist the fibers, wherein the linear density per filament of
the first component filaments is no greater than about 2.5
times the linear density per filament of the second and third
component filaments and wherein the sliver is spun at speeds
in excess of 70 meters per minute.In this process, the blend is first formed into
a sliver which is processed into a spun yarn using high
speed spinning techniques in
