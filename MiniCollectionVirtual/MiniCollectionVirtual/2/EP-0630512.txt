<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive (100) capable of receiving a cartridge (20) having a disk (42) with a diameter of about 3.5 inches which can contain at least 105 megabytes of data includes an operating mechanism (112) for initating and controlling the positioning of an actuator arm (176) upon which is mounted a read/write transducer (178). The position of a spindle motor (224) which is used to spin up the disk (42) contained in the cartridge (20) to an operating speed, the locking of the cartridge (20) in the disk drive (100) in an operating mode and the ejection of the cartridge (20) from the drive (100). The operating mechanism (112) can function to eject the cartridge (20) whether or not the drive (100) is powered up in order to be able to remove the cartridge (20) and transport it to another disk drive (100) or to a secured location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
removable cartridge disk drive capable of selectively
receiving a cartridge containing a disk for storing data
which disk can be accessed by the disk drive for writing
data to the disk and reading data from the disk.US patent 4870518 discloses a disc drive including a tray assembly for positively seating and
locking a cartridge onto a spindle motor. The drive includes heads mounted on a radial arm
voice coil actuator assembly and appropriate mechanisms including the arm control the
assembly and the ratchet and pawl projection ensure that the heads are properly loaded onto
the disc and that the cartridge insertion and ejection process does not cause damage to the
heads or the disc contained in the cartridge.As the demand for smaller, portable and more
powerful computers accelerates, less and less space can
be afforded to disk memory storage. However, higher
memory capacities are desired for this ever shrinking
form factor. One method of accomplishing higher memory
capacities is to provide for a removable cartridge disk
drive such that any number of removable cartridges can
be used to store as much data as is required for use
with the computer. Additionally, this data can be
secured in a safe location remote from the computer in 
order to ensure the confidentiality of the data when the
computer is not in use.In order to accommodate the ever decreasing
form factor desirable for the configuration of a hard
disk drive, there is a need to make both the removable
cartridge and the disk drive as compact as possible yet
offer a cartridge and disk drive design which can
operate repeatedly and reliably in order to have the
cartridge accepted into the disk drive and allow the
disk drive to access data stored in the cartridge.In such a removable cartridge disk drive, it
is desirable to have as few moving parts as possible and
to have these parts coordinated and synchronized in such
a way that the loading and unloading of the cartridge
and the accessibility of the data by a read/write head
or transducer mounted in the disk drive is efficiently
accomplished. It is further desirable to have the
movement of the parts coordinated in such a manner that
the entire operation of the disk drive can be performed
with as few as possible operating levers or mechanisms
for the user to be concerned with.The present invention is directed to a
removable cartridge disk drive which can preferably
receive a removable cartridge housing a disk which has a
diameter of about 3.5 inches or less and

<CLAIMS>
A removable cartridge disc drive (100) for
receiving a cartridge (20) containing a disk (42) for

storing data and mounted for rotation inside of the
cartridge with the cartridge received in the disc drive,

the disc drive comprising:

a housing;
means for receiving a cartridge inside of said
housing;
actuator arm means mounted in said housing for
moving a read/write transducer (178) relative to a

cartridge received in the receiving means in order to
transfer data between the transducer and a disk inside of

the cartridge;
motor means (224) mounted in said housing and
adapted for causing said disk to spin when the cartridge

is received by the receiving means;
means for retracting the actuator arm means to
a retracted position out of the way of a cartridge and

for releasing the actuator means to a released position;
and
means (112) for operating 
the retracting means in order to

position
said actuator arm means between a

retracted position and a released position,

characterised in that:
said operating means (112) operates
means for transporting said motor means between a

disk engaging position and a disk non-engaging position; wherein
said means for transporting include a motor ring
means (230), said motor ring means inter-operates with a

plurality of pins (248) extending there towards with at
least one of said pins loaded by a spring to allow said

motor means to be fully loaded against a baseplate (104),
and said motor ring means (230) including a plurality of

cam slot means (246) for receiving said pins (248) so
that as said operating means (112) operates said

means for transporting said pins follow the cam slots in
order to move the motor means (224)between said disk

engaging position and said disk non-engaging position;
and
a movable ramp arm (190) which assists the delivery
of said transducer (178) to said disk contained in said

cartridge, said ramp arm including a ramp surface (188).
The removable cartridge disk drive of claim 1, including:-
