<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit comprises a time-discrete oscillator (11) which 
generates 

numerical and time-discrete phase values of an oscillator signal. The 
circuit also 

comprises a time-continuous oscillator (120) which generates a 
time-continuous oscillation 

signal. The circuit comprises a phasemeter (132) which is coupled to the 
time-continuous 

oscillator in order to sample phase values of the time-continuous 
signal. The difference 

between the generated phase values and the sampled phase values is 
measured in a 

comparator circuit (140). This difference is utilized in a phase-locked 
loop in order to readjust 

the frequency of the time-continuous oscillator, so that the 
time-continuous oscillation is 

latched to the time-discrete oscillation. The phase comparison can thus 
be executed in a 

substantially time-discrete manner. As a result, the operational 
reproducibility of the 

circuit is very high. Because phase comparison is not restricted to a 
single, fixed phase 

point during the oscillation period, the phase locking exhibits hardly 
any jitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated circuit according to the preamble of claim 1.The time-discrete oscillator in the known circuit comprises a cyclic
counter. This counter comprises a register with a limited number of bits which represent
a count during operation. The counter increments the count by a fixed amount in each
clock cycle. Because a maximum count is imposed by the number of bits in the counter,
this is a modulo-addition. When the counter exceeds the maximum representable count
by a given amount during an addition, the counter will start the next addition as from
that amount. The time-discrete oscillator comprises a flipflop whose state changes
whenever the maximum count is exceeded in this manner. The output signal of the
flipflop serves as the time-discrete oscillation signal. The logic level of this signal thus
changes in the clock cycles in which the maximum count is exceeded.The time-discrete oscillator is an all-digital oscillator. The binary signal is
reproducible within the precision of the clock circuit. The instants at which the level of
the binary signal changes always coincide with the end of a clock cycle. The mean
period of the binary signal, i.e. twice the mean period of time elapsing between
successive level changes, follows from the ratio of the amount whereby the count is
incremented to the maximum count of the counter.When the mean period does not equal an integer number of periods
between clock cycles, the number of clock cycles between individual level changes will 
suffer from quantization noise or "jitter". In the course of time the period elapsing
between successive level changes of the binary signal will not always comprise the same
number of clock cycles, but will occasionally comprise one cycle more or less.In order to eliminate this effect, in accordance with the prior art the
binary signal is applied to an adjustable delay circuit. The delay of this circuit is
adjusted on the basis of the count: as the maximum count is exceeded by a larger
amount during an addition, the delay imparted to the binary signal is proportionally
less.The instant at which the level of the binary signal changes is thus shifted
in phase relative to the clock signals. The period duration between successive level
changes of the binary signal no longer amounts to an integer number of clock cycles.
The period duration between successive instants at which the maximum count is
exceeded can thus in principle be made equal to its mean value, so that jitter no longer
occurs.However, this
