<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a casing for electronic 
apparatus use in which metal and resin are subjected to a 

hybrid formation, so that the mechanical strength of the 
casing is improved and the thickness is reduced so as to 

reduce the weight. An electronic apparatus casing having 
a rib (16) and boss (18) is manufactured when metal (10) 

and resin (12) are integrally formed. Adhesive (14) is 
coated on the metal, and after the coated adhesive has 

been dried, the resin (12) is injected onto the adhesive 
layer from a portion which composes the rib or boss, so 

that the metal and resin are subjected to a hybrid 
formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a housing or casing for an electronic
apparatus such as a personal computer and the like, and
more particularly relates to a method of manufacturing a
casing for an electronic apparatus in which the
formability, mechanical strength and heat radiating (or
cooling) property are improved when metal and resin are
integrated into one body by applying an adhesive agent of
heat-resistant rubber or an adhesive agent of hot-melt
and also by applying a film-like adhesive agent or a
surface processing agent.There is provided a method referred to as "in-mold
forming" in which metallic parts and resin are
integrated by means of injection molding. According to
the in-mold forming method, metallic parts are set in a
metallic mold, and then resin is injected into the
metallic mold so as to integrate the parts with the
resin. There are two types of in-mold forming methods,
one is an insert forming method by which the metallic
parts are embedded in the resin, and the other is an
outset forming method by which resin parts are formed on
a metallic base plate.Conventionally, for the casing for a portable
electronic apparatus such as a notebook type computer,
electronic notebook, portable telephone and the like,
resin is used from the viewpoints of reducing the weight,
improving the appearance, and maintaining the insulation.
Usually, the weight of the casing is 30 to 50% of the
entire electronic apparatus. Accordingly, when the
weight of the casing is reduced, the weight of the entire 
electronic apparatus can be greatly reduced. In order to
reduce the weight of the electronic apparatus, the wall
thickness of the casing is reduced. However, the
mechanical strength of the ABS (acrylonitrile-butadienstyrene)
resin, which is commonly used for the casing, is
not sufficient, so that the wall thickness cannot be
reduced. Therefore, the casings can be made of
engineering plastics of high mechanical strength such as
aromatic polyamide and PPS (polypropylene styrene) or can
be made of polymer alloy of ABS-PC (polycarbonate) and
can be made by adding a bulking agent such as carbon
fiber.However, compared with ABS resin, it is
difficult to inject the above engineering plastics with
sufficient pressure to form a thin wall. Further, it is
difficult to coat or plate with metal the surface of the
above engineering plastics. Furthermore, even when the
above engineering plastics are used, sufficient
mechanical strength and rigidity are not provided. Even
when a polymer alloy is used
