<ABSTRACT>
A printer (10) with mixed base resolution capabilities, having a 
higher resolution monochrome component such as black and lower 

resolution components such as cyan, magenta and yellow. The 
different resolution components are integrated into the same 

printing mechanism for composite printing of higher resolution 
black and lower resolution color at the same time. For increased 

throughput, a higher resolution black printhead (98) has a wider swath.

This application is related to copending application docket
1093752-1 filed as U.S. Serial No. 08/145367 on October 29, 1993
in the name of Gary M. Nobel, et al. entitled INTERCONNECT SCHEME
FOR MOUNTING DIFFERENTLY CONFIGURED PRINTHEADS IN THE SAME
CARRIAGE, which application is assigned to the assignee of this
application.This application also relates to the following copending
applications which are commonly owned by the assignee of this
application, and which are incorporated herein by reference:ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECT SYSTEM FOR A PRINTER filed as Serial
No. 08/56,345 on April 30, 1993 in the names of Arthur K. Wilson,
et al. (corresponding to EP-A-622 253); MODULAR CARRIAGE ASSEMBLY FOR AN INKJET PRINTER filed as
Serial No. 08/55,618 on April 30, 1993 in the names of Arthur K.

AND DEVICE FOR PREVENTING UNINTENDED USE OF PRINT CARTRIDGES filed
as Serial No. 08/56,961 on May 3, 1993 in the names of Jeffrey A.
Thoman, et al. (corresponding to EP-A-623 471); SIDE BIASED DATUM SCHEME FOR INKJET CARTRIDGE AND
CARRIAGE filed as Serial No. 08/57,241 on April 30, 1993 in the
names of David W. Swanson, et al. (corresponding to EP-A-622 208); and PRINTHEAD WITH REDUCED
INTERCONNECTIONS TO A PRINTER filed as Serial No. 07/958,833 on
October 8, 1992 in the names of Michael B. Saunders, et al. (corresponding to EP-A-0592221).This invention relates generally to printers, and more
specifically to printing devices and techniques for monochrome and
color printers capable of achieving high quality resolution.High quality printers are typically characterized by numbers
indicating their resolution in dots per inch (dpi). This
resolution is usually described in the context of a two dimension
coordinate system where one number indicates the resolution in the
x-axis (as used herein, x-axis means the carriage scan axis for a
swath printer), and another number indicates the resolution in the
y-axis (as used herein, y-axis means the media advance axis for a
swath printer). Thus, a resolution of 300/300 dpi generally
indicates a carriage-scan axis resolution of 300 dots per inch and
a media-advance axis resolution of 300 dots per inch.The resolution of a printhead is primarily determined by the
actual printout dot size as it appears in a printout. So in the
ideal theoretical world, a 300 dpi
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mixed resolution printer (10) comprising:

a frame for holding a media in a print zone;
a carriage (50) supported on said frame to be
positioned adjacent to said print zone;
a first printhead (64) supported by said carriage, said
first printhead having a first array of nozzles (98) extending in a substantially perpendicular direction to the direction of movement of said first printhead relative to said media for

ejecting black ink droplets having a first drop size and having a first vertical print
resolution;
a second printhead (40) supported by said carriage in a
side-by-side relationship with said first printhead, said

second printhead having a second array of nozzles (96) extending in a substantially perpendicular direction to the direction of movement of said second printhead relative to said media for
ejecting non-black color ink droplets having a second dropsize substantially larger than said first drop size and having a second

vertical print resolution lower than said first vertical
print
 resolution; and
means (50, 41, 99) for energizing ink ejection elements
in said first and second printheads such that said first

printhead prints said black ink droplets at said first
vertical print resolution and said second printhead prints

said color ink droplets at said second vertical print
resolution for composite printing by said first and second

printheads on the media in said print zone.
A printer according to claim 1 wherein said second
printhead includes a color component selected from cyan, magenta,

yellow, red, green and blue.
A printer according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said first
printhead has a wider printing swath than said second printhead.
A printer according to claim 1 wherein said first array
of nozzles has a first nozzle pitch, and said second array of

nozzles has a second nozzle pitch, with said first nozzle pitch 
less than said second nozzle pitch as measured in a media advance

axis.
A printer according to any preceding claim wherein said
first and second printheads are mounted in said carriage in

relative positions along the media advance axis in order to
produce at least partially overlapping print swaths from said

first and second printheads.
A printer according to any preceding claim wherein said
second printhead is mounted in said carriage to be in completely

overlapped printing alignment with said first printhead.
A printer according to any preceding claim wherein said
first printhead prints at a resolution of 600 dots per inch and

said second printhead prints at a resolution of 300 dots per
inch.
A printer according to any preceding claim further
comprising a third printhead (22) and a fourth printhead (24)

supported by said carriage, said third and fourth printheads
being identical to said second printhead, but printing different

colors of ink.
A printer according to any preceding claim wherein said first
printhead is mounted in a print cartridge separate from a print cartridge

in which is mounted said second printhead.
