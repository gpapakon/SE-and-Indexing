<ABSTRACT>
Cracking of diamond sheets deposited by 
chemical vapor deposition on substrates such as niobium is 

sometimes observed as a result of curling of the diamond 
around the edges of the substrate. Such curling is inhibited 

by employing a substrate with edges of a metal promoting 
the formation of graphite. Illustrative graphite-promoting 

metals are iron, nickel and platinum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the chemical vapor 
deposition of diamond, and more particularly to the 
deposition of diamond films and sheets capable of clean 
release from the substrates on which they are deposited. The preparation of diamond articles by chemical 
vapor deposition is increasingly important in commerce. It 
is particularly useful for the production of polycrystalline 
diamond films and sheets. In the chemical vapor deposition method, a 
substrate capable of receiving a diamond deposit is 
contacted with an activated mixture of hydrogen and a 
hydrocarbon gas. Activation may be, for example, by 
thermal, microwave or plasma means or combinations 
thereof. The result of the activation is production of 
atomic hydrogen which converts the hydrocarbon to diamond 
crystals which deposit on the surface of the substrate, 
forming a polycrystalline diamond layer which is in the 
form of a planar film or sheet when the substrate is planar. It is frequently useful to separate the diamond 
film or sheet from the substrate. This is true, for example, 
when diamond is to be employed as a heat sink in an 
electronic device or the like. The separated film or sheet 
may then be cut, typically by laser action, into a number of 
segments of the desired size. The releasability of diamond layers from 
substrates depends to a large extent on the substrate 
material employed. It is frequently found that the diamond 
adheres more or less tenaciously to the substrate. This may 
cause fracturing of the diamond upon cool-down after 
formation or upon removal. Said fracturing may be in the  
 
form of shattering (which makes the diamond totally 
useless) or by cracking (which reduces its useful size). In copending, commonly owned application 
EP-A-0546752, there is disclosed a genus of substrates 
which promote releasability of the diamond coatings 
produced thereon. These substrates comprise hydride-forming 
metals such as niobium. When the combined 
substrate and diamond layer are cooled after deposition of 
the diamond, the latter is easily released. This is 
particularly true if hydrogen flow is continued during the 
cooling operation, which is believed to result in the 
formation of a hydride layer which further promotes 
diamond removal. Even with the use of such substrate materials, 
however, cracking is sometimes noted. This is frequently 
the result of the tendency of the diamond to grow or "curl" 
around one or more edges of the substrate, impeding 
release. There is also frequently a large difference 
betwee
