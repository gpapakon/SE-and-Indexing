<ABSTRACT>
A signal receiver that can function in any of three 
modes, such as normal mode, channel selecting mode, and 

mandatory announcement mode, is controlled by a microprocessor 
to mute the output signals or to release a muting operation 

depending upon the current mode. The signals being received 
contain an error detection/correction code and upon error 

decoding the number of error flags within predefined periods 
are checked to determine whether muting is required. The 

respective lengths of the predefined error flag checking 
periods are controlled in response to the current operating 

mode of the signal receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a signal receiving 
apparatus and, more particularly, to a signal receiving 
apparatus for receiving signals including error detection 
codes and that includes a muting mode. In data transmission there are some cases in which 
a coded signal containing errors is received by a receiving 
apparatus, transmission of the signals having been 
affected by noise or some other instantaneous disturbance. 
Though such code errors should preferably be small, the errors 
cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, in case an error is 
generated during transmission, the error code thereof is 
detected and error correction is carried out by a certain 
method so as to improve transmission quality. On the other 
hand, if the errors can not be corrected the demodulated 
signals are not output based the detected error code. For example, when RF-modulated pulse code modulation 
(PCM) digital signals are transmitted from a transmitter side 
and are demodulated at a receiver side, the error code of the 
demodulated signals is read and used to mute the demodulated 
signals if the errors can not be corrected. In an audio sound system of an aircraft where each 
group of seats includes a signal receiving apparatus, for 
example, demodulated signals are muted in accordance with an  
 
error code thereof, so that the passengers will not hear audio 
signals of deteriorated quality. In such case, the error code judging time, that is, 
the sampling time, is fixed to the sampling time of the normal 
operating mode of the audio signal playback apparatus forming 
part of the aircraft sound system. Nevertheless, in addition to the normal operating 
mode in which the passengers enjoy listening to music, there 
are other operating modes for the aircraft audio sound system, 
such as, a channel selection mode in which the passengers 
themselves tune to change the band being listened to, and a 
Passenger Address (PA) selection mode in which the same 
announcement is mandatorily made to all the receiving sets of 
the aircraft sound system. In this PA selection mode for announcing a message 
from the cockpit, the voices are outputted through so-called 
PA speakers throughout the aircraft, while the channel 
selection status of audio signals for each seat is controlled 
to switch to a predetermined PA channel, so as to assure 
delivery of the message to all of the passengers, including 
those using headphones. Meanwhile, if the sampling time for the error code 
is fixed for muting the demodulated signals in accordance
