<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a surgical needle (2) with a suture 
material or thread (4) secured to the end opposite the puncture 

tip (6), which is characterised in that the surfaces of the 
puncture tip (6) and of the zone (8) of the needle (2) adjoining 

it are matt-finished black or coloured black, continuously or 
with small breaks, by chemical or electrolytic means or by a 

covering, while the surface of the remaining section (10) of the 
needle (2), which can constitute up to ca. 50% of its length, 

consists of bare or untreated metal, up to the thread attachment 
(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application is a patent of addition to the principal 
patent DE 42 08 242.0. The invention relates to a surgical needle with a suture 
material or thread secured to the end opposite the puncture tip. Such surgical needles or sewing needles are generally known and 
in most cases consist of a corrosion-resistant metal, preferably 
of chrome-nickel steel. For small surgical operations bare 
needles or those which have not been surface-treated are used. 
For larger surgical operations, however, coloured or matt-finished 
needles have recently been used, as described, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,959,068. This colouring or matt-finishing 
is achieved either by chemical means through pickling 
or etching, or electrolytically using suitable anodic or 
cathodic treatment, optionally with reversion of polarity or 
using alternating current. A special form of pickling is also 
the so-called dipping or matt-dipping. In some cases stoving 
lacquers are also used for colouring or matt-finishing. As a 
result of the so-called colouring or matt-finishing of the 
surgical needle, the needle does not reflect under strong OP 
light and irritate the operator, an advantage particularly with 
larger operations.  Despite the popularity of these coloured or matt-finished 
needles, it has been proved a disadvantage that, particularly 
with needles which are coloured or matt-finished with shades of 
yellow to dark red and brown the operator can no longer 
precisely recognize the puncture area of the needle, i.e. the 
needle tip and the area adjacent to it, in the similarly 
coloured tissue or operative field, which makes the precise 
positioning of the suture difficult, not only in microsurgery 
but also in surgical operations generally. Known from U.S. Patent No. 3,840,015 is a surgical needle whose 
tip is provided with a photoluminescent covering which, when 
irradiated by a suitable source, is excited to light up. 
Otherwise the needle is bare or untreated at the surface. The 
photoluminescent covering does in fact improve the visibility of 
the needle tip, but does, however, require the use of an 
additional radiation source. Furthermore, such a covering is not 
unproblematical with regard to its toxicity. The untreated part 
of the needle, which, in the embodiment described, constitutes 
the largest part of its surface, can lead to undesirable and 
irritating reflexes. The object of the invention is to overcome the disadvantages 
mentioned and to provide a surgical needle which demonstrates 
the

<CLAIMS>
Surgical needle with a suture material or thread attached 
to the end opposite the puncture tip, characterised in that 

the surface of the puncture tip (6) and of the zone (8) of 
the needle (2) adjoining it is matt-finished black or 

coloured black, continuously or with small breaks, by 
chemical or electrolytic means or by a covering, while the 

surface of the remaining section (10) of the needle (2), 
which can constitute up to ca. 50% of its length, consists 

of bare or untreated metal up to the thread attachment 
(12). 
Needle according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
section (10) of the needle (2) which is bare or has not 

been surface-treated accounts for less than 25% of the 
needle length. 
Needle according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
section (10) which is bare or has not been surface-treated 

amounts to 4 to 10 mm, measured from the thread attachment 
(12). 
Needle according to claim 1, characterised in that the zone 
(6, 8) of the needle (2) which is matt-finished black or 

coloured black with small breaks is matt-finished or 
coloured in annular form (8') or in speckled form (8''), 

and is bare or has not been surface-treated between the 
matt-finished or coloured areas.
