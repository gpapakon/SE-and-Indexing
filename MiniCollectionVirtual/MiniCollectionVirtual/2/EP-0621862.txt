<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic salts of N,N'-diacetyl cystine, in the following 
referred to as DiNAc, with immunomodulating activity as well as pharmaceutical 
compositions based on these salts and methods for their pharmacological use. The invention 
specifically concerns methods to obtain crystalline, non-hygroscopic and chemically stable 
salts containing non-toxic organic cations, which are useful for therapy of diseases where a 
defect in the immune system is indicated. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine is a well known compound which is routinely used as a therapeutic 
agent against chronic obstructive diseases and chronic bronchitis. Although the first patent 
was filed in 1964 (GB 954268) the mechanism of action of the compound has not been 
established. It has recently been discovered that the corresponding disulfide of N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 
i.e. L-DiNAc, acts as a potent immunostimulator (Swedish patent application no 
SE 9002067-8), showing an activity comparable to contemporary immunostimulants such as 
sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate or 2,2'-dithiobisethanol. Routes for the preparation of DiNAc have been reported in several patents (US Patent Nos 
4,827,016, 4,724,239 and 4,708,965, European Patent No 300100 and German Patent No 
2326444). DiNAc is, however, amorphous and hygroscopic, so that it is difficult to isolate 
and formulate into pharmaceutical compositions and its administration is normally only in 
the form of aqueous solutions. Most salts of DiNAc with inorganic or organic cations share 
the same unfavourable physical properties with the free diacid. Examples of salts of other, 
sulfur-containing, amino acids have appeared in the patent literature (US patent No 
3,647,834, JP patent No 56155298 and FR patent No 8106592)  
 We have now surprisingly found that a few salts of DiNAc with organic bases exhibit a 
favourable combination of non-hygroscopicity and crystallinity which permits the isolation 
and formulation of these salts in solid form and allows them to be administered by inhalation 
in solid form, or in other dry formulations, should this be clinically desirable. The present invention provides organic salts of DiNAc, having the formula Ia or Ib: 
 
or 
 
where R+ and R2+ is a mono- or diprotonated organic amine respectively. The organic 
amine is selected from lysinium, ethylenediaminium, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediaminium, N-benzyl-2-phenylethylaminium, 
piperazinium and 1-adamantanaminium. Lysinium can be in its D- or L-form. Most preferred is the L-form. The invention
