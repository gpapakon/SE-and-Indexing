<ABSTRACT>
A method of mediation of traffic across a particular interface between the Advanced
Intelligent Network operated by a local exchange carrier and an outside service provider is

disclosed. The particular interface is defined between an application by a non-local
exchange carrier service provider for some form of enhanced telephone service requiring use

of the Advanced Intelligent Network and a shared execution environment interpreter on the
other side of the interface. Mediation is conducted by the shared execution interpreter that is

run on a local exchange carrier operated service control point. The shared execution
interpreter enforces sufficient rules so that the local exchange carrier does not require

knowledge of the details of implementation of the service provider's application. The
methodology defines a unique transaction identifier that is defined and known on the local

exchange carrier side of the interface. A table is created carrying the unique transaction
identifiers with service process identifiers generated by various service provider applications.

In this way, the shared execution environment interpreter can pass messages and instructions
across the interface to the service provider's application that only reference the application's

internally generated service process identifier. This isolates the service provider application
from unnecessary information about the operation of the network and the operation of other

service providers services. Mediation rules include testing of tables to determine whether a
directory number referenced in a message request from a service provider application is a

customer of the service provider, whether trunk group routing requests are valid for the
service providers and whether any access to, or particular levels of access to, certain network

elements are authorised for the service provider requesting same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of switched
telephony and in particular is a method of mediating message
content and network impact that will be allowed by providing
access to the advanced intelligent network associated with modern
telephone switching systems to a wide range of entities other than
a telephone service provider.In the slightly more than a century of having
telephone service available in the United States, the public
switched telephone system has constantly evolved and grown in
complexity, size, and capabilities. From the days in which calls
were routed by a human operator working a plug board to switch
and complete calls, the capacity of the system in both volume of
traffic and service options have expanded greatly. A telephone
company central office or central office switch is a device to
which multiple subscriber lines are connected, each of which is
terminated by a telephonic device of a customer. For
conventional residential telephone service, one or more telephone
sets will be connected to the subscriber line. Additionally, the
central office has multiple trunk circuits connecting it to other 
central offices. Other trunk circuits are provided to customers,
such as trunks feeding a private branch exchange (PBX) switch in
a business office.Some early developments of enhanced telephone
service include the introduction in the early 1960s of direct long
distance dialing. Prior to that time, all long distance toll calls had
to be handled by one or more human operators who set up the
call circuit and activated billing equipment. An important feature
of the enabling technology for direct long distance dialing is the
capability of switches to collect, store, and forward data
identifying the dialed digits, i.e., the called number. These were
transmitted through the network, as the call was set up via a well
known signaling scheme known as multifrequency (MF)
signaling. MF signaling is a species of in-band signaling in that
the information signals (identification of the called number) was
transmitted by signals within the voice frequency band, over the
same trunk circuits that carried the voice signal once the call was
completed. This technology allowed a much higher volume of
long distance traffic to be handled and helped to significantly
improve telephone service and to meet the demand for more and
more service in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s.
The major drawback of in-band signaling techniques was that they
occupied voice trunk capacity during call set up.

<CLAIMS>
A method of maintaining an intelligent switched telephone network that
includes a plurality of digital data communications channels among a plurality of Advanced

Intelligent Network (AIN) elements including a plurality of service switching points (15) at a
like plurality of central offices and at least one service control point (SCP) (50), 
characterised
by
: said at least one service control point (50) being a mediated service control point (50)
that includes an SCP computer running a Shared Execution Environment (SEE) interpreter

(59) for processing Local Exchange Carrier applications (57) and Service Provider
applications (56); the method comprising the steps of: causing said SCP computer (51) to

maintain a table of directory numbers and triggers such that, for each said directory number in
said table, each active trigger type is associated with one and only one of said Local Exchange

Carrier applications (57) and Service Provider applications (56) processed by said SEE
interpreter; and causing said SCP computer (51) to check said table in response to each AIN

Network Maintenance message requesting creation of a new entry in said table to determine if
said new entry specifies a particular directory number and a particular trigger type for which

an existing entry is present and to execute said AIN Network Maintenance message only if
such existing entry is not found.
