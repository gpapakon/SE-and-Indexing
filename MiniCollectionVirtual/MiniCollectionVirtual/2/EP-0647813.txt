<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extensible device for
supporting objects, with special features making it both
practical and easy to use, especially for illumination devices as
in photographic studios and the like.The present invention relates to a device from which objects,
such as spotlights or other means of illumination, may be hung.
It is of the kind that comprises a pantograph system of
articulated rods linking together two attachment points, one of
which is designed to support the object and the other to connect
the device to a supporting structure, typically an overhead
structure.These devices have means for balancing the weight of the
suspended object and enabling the articulated rod system to be
lengthened or shortened. These means currently consist (in the
smaller types of systems) of one or two leaf springs that provide
an approximately constant load independently of how much the
system may be extended and that are spiral-wound. An example of
such a device is disclosed in GB-A-2,083,433. These springs have
many drawbacks, including:
the risk of sudden breakage when the spring is under tension.
This can cause very serious harm and permanent injury to anyone
near the device; the difficulty of adjusting the load of the spring to suit the
weight of the object hanging from the device. In order to make
adjustments, the spring has to be dismantled from the
articulated rod system;  the articulated rod system contracts suddenly under the spring
loading whenever the object it is supporting is removed.  The object of the present invention is to provide a device of
the kind outlined above which will overcome these drawbacks and
be safe and practical in use.These and other objects, which will be clear to those skilled
in the art as they read the following text, are achieved by the
features described in Claim 1. GB-A-1,160,668 discloses a
telescopic load support with a set of telescopically related
tubes, at one end of which a spool is arranged. The cable wound
on the spool is attached at the opposite end at the telescopic
tubes, to support a load.In practice, in an advantageous embodiment, the device
comprises in combination: a structure composed of articulated
rods extending between a fixed attachment point and a free
attachment point for the object to be supported, this structure
being extensible in the direction of the straight line joining
the fixed attachment point and the free attachment point, and
being symmetrical about this line and substantially rigid in
directions perpendicular to the

Extensible device for supporting an object, especially an
illuminating appliance for photographic studios, comprising:


a pantograph structure including opposite parallel series of
articulated rods (3, 9) for linking together two end attachment

points (5, 7), one (7) of which is designed to be fastened to the
object to be supported and the other (5) to be fastened to a

supporting structure; and
at least one spool (13) for a cord (17) that is capable of
being wound onto and off said spool and is fastened to the

structure of articulated rods (3, 9), characterized in that the
assembly formed by the spool and the cord (13, 17) constitutes a

means of balancing the weight of the object supported by said
device, through the use of elastic return means (16) and an

adjustable brake means (23, 25) acting on said spool (13).
Device according to Claim 1, in which said spool (13) is
mounted on a pin (15) that joins together two opposite and

parallel series (3, 9) of articulated rods.
Device according to Claim 1, in which: the articulated rod
structure capable of extension in the direction of the straight

line (L-L) joining the two endmost attachment points (5, 7) is
symmetrical about said line and substantially rigid in directions

perpendicular thereto; the spool (13) is rotatable about a pin
(15) inserted in said rod (3, 9) structure at a point close to

one (7) of said attachment points (5, 7), said spool being
provided with spring means (16) for winding up the cord (17);

said cord has one end fixed to said rod structure close to said
line (L-L) at a point between the attachment point (5) furthest

from the spool and the spool (13) itself, and the other end fixed 
to the circumference of the spool (13); extending which rod

structure draws out said cord (17) from the spool, said drawing
out being opposed by means (19) which adjustably brake the

rotation of the spool (13) only in the direction of unwinding of
the cord, so as to oppose the component of the weight of the

supporting device and of the object to be supported in the
direction of extension of the rod structure in order to make it

possible to balance said total weight and keep the supported
object at the desired distance from the point of attachment to

the supporting structure (5); the free turning of which spool in
the opposite direction together with the winding up of the cord

(17) onto the spool (13) results in the rod structure moving in
the opposite direction to that of extension with no extra load

other than that of the total weight of the supporting device and
object and of the friction between the moving parts of said rod

structure.
Device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which said spool
possesses: a recessed seat containing a spiral spring (16) whose

outermost end is attached to the spool and whose innermost end is
attached to the pin and, on the opposite side from said recessed

seat and coaxial with said pin (15), a threaded seat (27) on
which is m
ounted a toothed wheel (21) belonging to a ratchet-type
arresting mechanism, said wheel (21) being positioned between the

body of the spool and a nut (25) screwed onto said seat (27),
while elastic means (23) are located between said nut (25) and

said toothed wheel (21).
Device according to Claim 4, in which said elastic
means comprise a Belleville washer (23).
Device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which said
articulated rod structure comprises: a first series (1) of rods

(3) hinged together to form a succession of deformable
parallelograms extending along the straight line (L-L) joining

the two endmost attachment points (5, 7), each rod forming part
of two adjacent parallelograms; and a second series (9) of hinged 

rods identical to the first series (1) and facing the latter, the
two series having in common at least the outermost hinge pins

(11) of said rods (3) so that the assembly has sufficient
transverse rigidity.
Device according to Claim 6, in which said attachment points
(5, 7) each comprise a sleeve (5.1, 7.1) fitted with a wing nut

for manually fastening the attachment point, on the one hand, of
the supporting device to a fixed rod and, on the other hand, of

the object to be supported to said supporting device; said
sleeves (5.1, 7.1) each being firmly fixed to a U bracket (5.2,

7.2) in which one of the two arms of the U is extended and
contains a slot (5.3, 7.3); said U brackets (5.2, 7.2) being

hinged by a pin (35, 37) to the free end of the last rods (3.1)
of the two series of rods (1, 9) forming said structure, and by

means of said slots (5.3, 7.3) the first is guided on one of the
rod structure pins (39) located along the axis of symmetry of

said structure, and the second is guided on the pin (15) of the
spool (13) in such a way as to keep the sleeves (5.1, 7.1) lined

up with each other however far the supporting device is extended.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in which the means
(19) for opposing the free turning of the spool (13) in the

unwinding direction of the cord (17) comprise: a ratchet
mechanism with a toothed wheel (21) mounted coaxially on the

spool (13) and pressed axially against the spool by a Belleville
washer (23) with a force that can be adjusted by means of a nut

(25) screwed onto a threaded seat (27) integral and coaxial with
the spool (13), so as to create adjustable frictional torque

between the toothed wheel (21) and the spool (13); and a pawl
(29) mounted on one of the pairs of rods carrying the pin (15) of

the spool (13), said pawl being acted on by a spring (33) so that
one end (29.1) of the pawl is introduced between the teeth of the

toothed wheel (21), thereby preventing it from rotating only in
the direction of unwinding of the cord (17).
Device according to Claim 8, in which the other end (29.2) of 
said pawl (29) can be grasped manually to disengage the pawl (29)

when it is wished to extend the supporting device without having
to overcome the friction of the brake.
