A mechanism for a continuous variation of the 
rotational speed between a driving member (1) and a driven 

member comprising two truncated cones for the movement 
transmission, one of the truncated cones (3) being mounted on a 

driving shaft (2) secured to the driving member and the other 
truncated cone (5) being mounted in the direction opposite the 

direction of the truncated cone (3) on a driven shaft (6) 
secured to said driven member ; and a roller (4) comprised of 

two truncated cones opposite with respect to their large bases, 
one of them being engaged with the truncated cone (3) mounted 

on said driving shaft and the other one being engaged with the 
truncated cone (5) mounted on said driven shaft, said roller 

being translationally movable along one generatrix of each 
truncated cone (3 or 5) in order to vary the driven 

shaft speed;
 
   said mechanism being characterized in that : 


the generatrices of the truncated cones (3 and 5) 
mounted on said driving and driven shafts (2 and 6) 

respectively have a concave shape and the generatrices of 
truncated cones of said roller (4) have a convex shape, 
the contact between said truncated cones is such that 
the vertex of each truncated cone of said roller is converging 

with one or the other of the truncated cones (3, 5) vertices, 
the base of the latter ones being taken at the middle of the 

portion in contact with said roller, and this, whatever the 
roller position along the generatrices on which it is 

translationally moved, and 
the variation of the roller position on the truncated 
cones (3, 5) is obtained by revolving said roller achieved by 

any variation system (8) in one direction or the other of its 
vertical axis for it to have a screwing movement on truncated 

cones (3, 5), and thus enable it to be moved along the 
generatrices of truncated cones (3, 5) whereby an increase or  

 
decrease in the drive ratio is obtained according to which 

direction it is tilted. 
The mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the 
transmission of a driving torque from the truncated cone (3) 

mounted on the driving shaft secured to the driving member to 
the truncated cone (5) mounted on the driven shaft secured to 

the driven member, is achieved by means of said roller (4) 
maintained in rolling contact without sliding on its whole 

width with said truncated cones (3 and 5) thanks to a pressure 
means (7) within said variation system (8) and providing a 

force at least equal to the driving torque one. 
The mechanism according to claim 2, wherein the 
surfaces of said truncated cones (3, 5) for the movement 

transmission and the said truncated cones of said roller (4) 
include a material having a high friction coefficient.
