<ABSTRACT>
The belt (1) is made of an elastomeric material (2) or 
the like in which longitudinal stranded reinforcing 

cables (L, R) are incorporated. The reinforcing 
cables (L) incorporated in one side portion (B) of the 

belt (1) are twisted predominantly in one sense. The 
reinforcing cables (R) incorporated in an opposite side 

portion (C) are twisted predominantly in the opposite 
sense. The side portions (B, C) of the belt (1) 

therefore have a spontaneous tendency to bend which 
facilitates the transition of the belt (1) from the 

flat configuration to the closed, tube-like 
configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible belt of elastomeric 
material or the like as defined in the preamble of 
Claim 1. A flexible belt of this kind is disclosed in FR-A-2 
637 272. The side portions of this prior art belt include 
respective edge portions having an important, quite thick 
cross-section and, adjacent thereto, respective intermediate 
portions which are, comparatively, very thin. Said 
enlarged edge portions are provided with respective mating 
formations which can be brought into engagement with one 
another to retain the belt in a closed, tube-like configuration. 
Each edge portion incorporates a single reinforcing 
cable. Said cables are twisted in opposite senses. Flexible belts for tube conveyors are also described, for 
example, in EP-A-0 336 385. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
flexible belt of the type indicated above, the structure of 
which is such as to facilitate its bending during its 
transition from the substantially flat configuration to the 
closed, tube-like configuration. This object is achieved, according to the invention, by 
means of a flexible belt having the features defined in 
Claim 1. In a belt according to the invention the twisting moments 
transmitted by the stranded reinforcing cables incorporated 
in the side portions of the belt are such as to induce said 
portions to bend towards each other spontaneously, thus 
facilitating the transition of the belt from a substantially 
flat configuration to the closed, tube-like configuration, 
the transition  
 
normally being induced as a result of the interaction 
of the belt with deflector rollers disposed on the path 
of the belt. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention 
will become clear from the description which follows 
purely by way of non-limiting example, with reference 
to the appended drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a cross-section of a belt according to the 
invention, in a flat configuration; Figure 2 is a sectioned view of the belt of Figure 1 
showing the spontaneous tendency of the belt to bend; Figure 3 is a sectioned view of a belt according to the 
invention in the closed, tube-like configuration; and Figure 4 is a cross-section of an embodiment of a 
stranded reinforcing cable incorporated in a belt 
according to the invention, on an enlarged scale. With reference to Figures 1 to 3, a flexible belt 
according to the invention is generally indicated 1. The belt 1 is made of an elastomeric material 2, or the 
like, in which longitudinal reinforcing

<CLAIMS>
A flexible belt (1) of elastomeric material or the 
like for conveyors in which the belt (1) is bent 

transversely and, as a result of the superposition of its 
longitudinal edges (D1, D2), is closed like a tube; the 

belt (1) having, in a transverse cross-section, a central 
portion (A) and two opposite side portions (D1, B; D2, C) 

in each of which a respective longitudinal stranded 
reinforcing cable (L; R) is incorporated, said cables (L; 

R) being twisted in opposite senses; said side portions 
(D1, B; D2, C) including each a lateral edge portion (D1; 

D2) and an intermediate portion (B; C) joining with said 
central portion (A);
 
   characterised in that in one of said intermediate 

portions (B) the belt (1) comprises a set of reinforcing 
cables (L) which are twisted predominantly in one sense 

whereas in the opposite intermediate portion (C) the belt 
(1) comprises a set of reinforcing cables (R) which are 

twisted predominantly in the opposite sense; the 
arrangement being such that th
e twisting moments exerted by 
said reinforcing cables (L; R) are such as to induce said 

intermediate portions (B; C) to bend one towards the other. 
A belt according to Claim 1, characterized in that in 
said central portion (A) alternate reinforcing cables (R, 

L) are twisted in one sense and in the opposite sense, 
respectively. 
A belt according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that a textile reinforcing structure (G) is incorporated 

beneath the layer of reinforcing cables (L, R). 
A belt according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that reinforcing wires or strands (T) with 

smaller cross-sections are incorporated close together in  
 

the longitudinal edge portions (D1, D2). 
A belt according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each reinforcing cable (L, R) 

comprises at least three strands (14, 16, 18), which are 
preferably bare and are twisted around a continuous profile 

(22) with a star-like cross-section having at least three 
arms or branches (M, N, P) each of which extends far enough 

between two consecutive strands to prevent direct physical 
contact between the strands (14, 16, 18). 
A belt according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
strands (14, 16, 18) are formed by steel wires (20). 
A belt according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, characterized 
in that the continuous profile (22) of each reinforcing 

cable (L, R) is of polymeric material.
