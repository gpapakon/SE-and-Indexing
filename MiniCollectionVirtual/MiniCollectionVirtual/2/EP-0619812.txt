<DESCRIPTION>
 Title; Azole Derivative Herbicides and FungicidesField of the inventionThis invention concerns new azole derivatives having herbicidal/fungicidal activity, processes for their preparation, and compositions containing them.DescriptionIr. one aspect, the invention provides the compounds of the formula:where:Az is imidazol-1-yl or 1,2,4-triazol-l-yl; each X represents halogen, carboxy, nitro, cyano, a group COR5, COOR5 or S(0)pR5, or an optionally substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or heteroaryl group; or two adjacent groups X- together form a fused benzo group;R1 represents a group CN, COR5, COOR5 or S(0)pR5; R2 represents a group CN, COR5, COOR5, S(0)pR5,S02N(R5)2, P(O) (OR5)2, nitro, aryl, heteroaryl or aralkyl; R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, each represent hydrogen, or an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group; R5 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group; or hydrogen (but only when p is 0) ; n is 0 to 4; and p is 0 to 2. 

 Any alkyl group present in the molecule is preferably of 1 to 8, especially of 1 to 4, carbon atoms, eg methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or t-butyl. Where such a group is substituted, the substituent groups may, for example, include halogen, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (eg methoxy or ethoxy) , or aryl (eg phenyl) .Any alkenyl or alkynyl group present in the molecule is preferably of 2 to 6 carbon atoms, eg vinyl, allyl or propargy1. Any cycloalkyl group present in the molecule is preferably of 3 to 7 carbon atoms, eg cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl.' Any aryl moiety present in the molecule is preferably a phenyl moiety. Where such a group is substituted, the substituent groups may, for example, include halogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (eg methyl) , alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (eg methoxy or ethoxy) , nitro, or a further phenyl group.Any heteroaryl group present in the molecule is preferably thienyl, furyl or pyridyl.R1 is preferably a group -COOR5*1 (particularly where R5*1 is alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, allyl, phenyl or benzyl) , and especially such a group where R-" is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl or n-butyl. R2 is preferably cyano, optionally substituted phenyl, benzoyl, optionally substituted phenylthio, -COOR5*1 (particularly where R51 is alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, methoxyethyl, cyclopentyl, allyl or benzyl, and especially methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl or n-butyl) , or -S02R5b (where R5b is-alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenyl, pyridyl or benzyl, especially phenyl) .In
