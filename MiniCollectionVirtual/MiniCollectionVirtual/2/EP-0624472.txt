<ABSTRACT>
In a printhead assembly (26), a nozzle plate (44) is 
bonded directly to special traces (38) formed on a 

flexible tape automated bonding (TAB) circuit (28), using 
a commercially available automatic lead bonder (96), to 

retain the nozzle plate (44) in place on the TAB circuit 
(28). 

The TAB circuit (28) is handled in a reel-to-reel 
film format which is commonly used for electronic chip 

packaging. In a next step of the reel-to-reel process, an 
automatic bonder (100) manipulates individual substrates 

(46), aligns each substrate (46) to an associated nozzle 
plate (44), and bonds electrodes (54) on the substrate 

(46) to corresponding leads (30) formed on the TAB circuit 
(28). 

In the process of the automated bonder (100) 
aligning the substrate (46) to the nozzle plate (44), the 

substrate (46) is automatically aligned with respect to 
the leads (30) on the TAB circuit. Commercially available 

automatic bonding equipment can be used to perform the 
alignment and bonding steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to inkjet 
printheads and, more particularly, to an improved method 
for fabricating an inkjet printhead. Inkjet printheads operate by ejecting a droplet of 
ink through a nozzle and onto a recording medium, such as 
a sheet of paper. When a number of nozzles are arranged 
in a pattern, such as one or more linear arrays, the 
properly sequenced ejection of ink from each nozzle causes 
characters or other images to be printed on the paper as 
the printhead is moved relative to the paper. The paper 
is typically shifted each time the printhead has moved 
across the paper. The printhead is usually part of a 
disposable print cartridge containing a supply of ink, 
where the print cartridge is easily installed in and 
removed from the printer. In one design of a thermal inkjet print cartridge, 
the print cartridge includes: 1) an ink reservoir and ink 
channels to supply ink proximate to each of the nozzles; 
2) a nozzle plate in which the nozzles are formed in a 
certain pattern; and 3) a substrate attached to a bottom 
surface of the nozzle plate, where a series of thin film 
heaters are formed on the substrate, generally one below 
each nozzle. Each heater includes a thin film resistor 
and appropriate current leads. To print a single dot of 
ink, an electrical current from an external power supply 
is passed through a selected heater. The heater is 
ohmically heated, in turn superheating a thin layer of the  
 
adjacent ink. This results in explosive vaporization of 
the ink, causing a droplet of ink to be ejected through an 
associated nozzle onto the paper. One example of this type of print cartridge is shown 
in Fig. 1 as print cartridge 10. Print cartridge 10 
generally includes a body 12 which acts as an ink 
reservoir. Body 12 may have formed on it one or more 
projections, such as projection 13, to enable print 
cartridge 10 to be secured in place within an ink printer. 
The printhead portion 14 of print cartridge 10 includes a 
metal nozzle plate 16 (such as a gold-plated nickel nozzle 
member), which has two parallel arrays of nozzles 17 
formed in it using conventional photolithographic 
techniques or other known techniques. Nozzle plate 16 is 
attached by an adhesive to an underlying substrate (not 
shown) which includes heater resistors paired with each of 
nozzles 17. A flexible insulating tape 18 has formed on it a 
number of conductors which terminate in contact pads 20. 
The other ends of the conductors on tape 18 are connected, 
using tape
