<ABSTRACT>
A washing method capable of washing the laundry made of a 
fabric which is thin and shrinkable such as silks, wools, 

etc., simply at home without damaging the delicate fabrics and 
washing machine which is suitable for carrying out the above 

washing method. A detergent is introduced into a washing tank 
(100) equipped with a rotary blade (110) for generating a 

water stream and then a first amount of water suitable for 
diluting the detergent is introduced into the washing tank 

(100). Then, while rotating the rotary blade (110) to generate 
a first water stream in the first amount of water, water is 

continuously introduced into the washing tank (100), so that 
the detergent is diluted in the first amount of water and that 

the washing tank (100) is filled with a second amount of water 
suitable for washing the washing object. Then, the washing 

object is introduced into the washing tank (100) with the 
second amount of water and then the washing object is washed 

by rotating the rotary blade (110) for generating a second 
water stream suitable for washing the washing object. The 

rotation time of the rotary blade (110) in the washing and 
rinsing steps is adjusted in accordance with the material of 

the washing object, so a water stream suitable for the washing 
object is generated in the washing and rinsing steps. A dry 

cleaning washing and silk washing courses can be simply 
performed at home without any damages to the laundry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of washing 
clothes and a washing machine. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a washing method and a washing machine 
capable of performing bile washing method wherein a 
dry-cleaning course for a washing object is performed by 
controlling a rotation speed of a rotary blade and water 
stream time and also a washing object made of delicate fabrics 
such as silk or wools can be washed clean without any damages. In general, in a fully automatic washing machine, washing 
the laundry is performed by sequentially performing washing, 
rinsing, draining and dewatering operations in accordance with 
predetermined programs which are installed therein. Fig. 1 is 
a block diagram showing a construction of a fully automatic 
washing machine. As shown in Fig. 1, the conventional fully 
automatic washing machine has a key array part 12 for 
generating washing order signals in accordance with a user's 
selection, a microcomputer (hereinafter, often referred to as 
"micom") 10 for generating control signals for performing 
various operations in accordance with the user's order 
signals, a driving part 16 for driving various parts pursuant 
to the control signals from micom 10 and a display part 14 for 
displaying the user's instructions and the operation status of  
 
the washing machine. When washing the laundry by using the conventional fully 
automatic washing machine, firstly the user switches on the 
washing machine, selects a washing process which he wants, and 
then inputs this from key array part 12 so that the washing 
machine performs the washing process. Thereafter, the laundry 
is introduced into a washing tank and then a detergent is 
introduced into the washing tank in an amount suitable for the 
laundry. The detergent can be introduced into the washing tank 
manually or automatically by micom 10. At the bottom of the 
washing tank, a rotary blade for generating a water stream is 
provided. Washing water is supplied into the washing tank 
through a water introducing pipe while rotating the rotary 
blade at a low speed or at a stationary state of the rotary 
blade. With rotating the rotary blade at a low speed, water 
and the laundry can be mingled together before the washing 
process. When a predetermined amount of water suitable for the 
laundry is introduced into the washing tank, a sensor senses 
this and sends a washing start signal to micom 10. Then, micom 
10 sends a water introducing stop signal to driving part 16, 
which closes a water
