<ABSTRACT>
In a process for preparing a dehydrogenation catalyst of the 
type in which a support comprising zinc aluminate is impregnated with at 

least one of platinum and tin from an impregnation solution, the 
improvement comprises simultaneously impregnating the support with the 

platinum and the tin by contacting the support with an impregnation 
solution which comprises, in solution, a tin compound, a platinum 

compound, and a carboxylic acid. The thus prepared catalyst can be 
employed in the dehydrogenation of at least one alkane containing 2-8 

carbon atoms per molecule in the presence of steam.

<DESCRIPTION>
According to one aspect, this invention relates to a process for
preparing a dehydrogenation
catalyst comprising platinum and tin on a zinc aluminate-containing support.In the preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts comprising
platinum and tin on a zinc aluminate-containing support, it is known to
impregnate the support with platinum and/or tin by contacting such
support with an impregnation solution having at least one of a platinum
compound or tin compound dissolved therein. However, improvement in
such dehydrogenation catalysts with respect to activity (i.e.
conversion), selectivity to olefins, and rate of deactivation would be
desirable.It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a
process for preparing a
dehydrogenation catalyst comprising a zinc aluminate-containing support 
which is impregnated with platinum and/or tin from an impregnation
solution, and which demonstrates improved performance in the
dehydrogenation of alkanes with respect to activity, selectivity to
olefins (particularly monoolefins), and rate of deactivation.The above objects are realized by the various aspects of the
invention described below.According to
the invention there is provided a process as defined in claim 1.
In this process for preparing a
dehydrogenation catalyst of the type in which a support comprising zinc
aluminate is impregnated with at least one of platinum and tin from an
impregnation solution, the improvement comprises simultaneously
impregnating the support with the platinum and the tin by contacting the
support with an impregnation solution which comprises, in solution, a
tin compound, a platinum compound, and a oxalic acid,
and an inorganic acid, wherein the impregnation solution has been
formed by combining (i) a first solution comprising the platinum
compound and the oxalic acid, and (ii) a second solution
comprising the tin compound and the inorganic acid. The dehydrogenation catalyst produced according to the above-described
process can be used in the
dehydrogenation of at least one alkane containing 2-8 carbon atoms per
molecule, in the presence of steam, to at least one alkene.It is shown in a subsequent example that a dehydrogenation
catalyst prepared in accordance with the invention demonstrates, in the
dehydrogenation of an alkane, higher activity, higher selectivity to
olefins (particularly monoolefins), and a slower rate of deactivation
than comparative catalysts produced in accordance with prior art
processes.In the presently preferred method of preparing the zinc
aluminate-contain
