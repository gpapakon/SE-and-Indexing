<ABSTRACT>
Formed products such as foams, fabrics for industrial materials, 
filaments, nonwoven fabrics, composite materials and films which are 

degradable after use with ease in the natural environment are prepared 
by using a high molecular weight aliphatic polyester obtained by direct 

polycondensation of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with aliphatic 
polybasic acid or additionally hydroxycarboxylic acid or oligomers of 

these materials in a reaction mixture containing a solvent. 
Foams have excellent thermal insulation and strength; fabrics are 
excellent in thermal insulation, strength and elongation and can be used 

for industrial materials; filaments have sufficient strength, 
flexibility and degradability in a living body and can be used for 

bioabsorbable surgical filament and fishing lines; nonwoven fabrics can 
be obtained by bonding a web of filaments and have excellent strength 

and feeling; composite materials can be prepared by adhering or 
impregnating fiber, paper, film and others of cellulosics and have 

excellent strength and water resistance, good flexibility and folding 
resistance, simultaneously have degradability in the natural 

environment, and can dissolve polymer films on the surface with ease 
under alkaline conditions to recover cellulosics alone; and films are 

excellent in heat resistance and strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a degradable aliphatic polyester
formed product
that can be degraded after use in the natural environment with ease.Conventionally, formed product such as foams, fabrics for industrial
materials, filaments, decomposable nonwoven fabrics, composite
materials and films have been prepared from polyolefin, polyurethane,
polyamide and other resins. These formed products, however, have a
very slow rate of decomposition in the natural environment and
semipermanently remain under the ground when buried in disposal.
Further, abandoned plastics lead to problems by impairing the view
or destroying the living environment of marine organisms. When the
refuse is disposed by incineration, toxic gases develop and cause
destruction of environment on earth and additionally lead to problems
by accelerating deterioration of incinerators.Foams have been widely applied to thermal insulation materials and
shock absorbers. These foams can be prepared from a small amount of
resin and thus are utilized for light weight and cheap containers of
food, thermal insulation materials and shock absorbers. However, forms
prepared from these resins are bulky and increase amount of refuse when
they are abandoned after use.Conventional fabrics also cause similar problems, though excellent 
as an industrial material.As to bioabsorbable surgical filaments, conventionally, mainstream
catgut were prepared by dividing and purifying small intestine tissue
of a cow and successively polishing into the form of fishing strings
have drawbacks of rapid decrease of the tensile strength retention in a
body and also of great difference depending upon a patient in the rate
of absorption into the body. Thus, conventional catguts are being
replaced by synthetic filaments.A silk thread hydrolyzes after the lapse of a long period in a
living body and is used for a suture portion which requires
decomposition in a living body, for example, in the case of suture of
intestines. A silk thread, however, is deficient in strength and thus
synthetic filaments are also replacing a silk thread.Synthetic filaments prepared from polyglycolic acid are most
frequently used for absorbable surgical sutures, and Opeporix, Dexon
and Medifit in which polyglycolic acid is used as a base material are
put on the market. However, polyglycolic acid sutures are applied in
the form of a multifilament because polyglycolic acid homopolymer has
high stiffness. Polyglactin 910Â® (product of Ethicon Co.) is a
copolymer of glycolide and lactide and put on the
