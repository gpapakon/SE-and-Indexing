<ABSTRACT>
Temperature control device with a refrigerant circuit (2). Depending on the temperature of a medium (50) to be cooled and depending on the temperature of the refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit (2), the variable throughflow cross-section size of an expansion valve (16) is regulated by supplying to an evaporator (18) only so much liquid refrigerant that the entire refrigerant in the evaporator (18) is reliably evaporated. The dependence on the temperature of the medium (50) to be cooled lies in the fact that a temperature sensor (42), which measures the temperature of the refrigerant at the outlet (36) of the evaporator (18), is cooled in dependence on the medium temperature. The measurement result of the refrigerant temperature sensor (42) is thereby falsified and the expansion valve (16) is regulated in dependence on a refrigerant temperature value which is below the actual value of the refrigerant temperature.
