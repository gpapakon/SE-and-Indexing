of them being oriented with their longitudinal direction 

towards the force-application area (23) and two 
transversely thereto. 
Silicon chip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the chip has two piezoresistive elements (21) 

with a longitudinal direction which is prescribed by the 
contacts, the said piezoresistive elements (21) being 

arranged in the force-application area (23) with their 
longitud
inal direction pointing in the same direction. 
Silicon chip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the chip has four piezoresistive elements (21) 

with a longitudinal direction prescribed by the contacts, 
the said piezoresistive elements (21) being arranged on 

a measurement line (24), two of the piezoresistive  
 

elements (21) being oriented with their longitudinal 
direction on the measurement line (24) and two transversely 

thereto. 
Silicon chip according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the chip (20) consists of a solid 

piece of silicon (100), and in that the force-application 
area (23) is arranged in the centre and the circuits (22) 

are arranged at the edge of the chip. 
Silicon chip according to one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that at least one trench 

(122) is provided in the upper side (121) of the silicon 
chip (20), and in that the circuits (22) are located on 

the side of the trench (122) facing away from the force-application 
area (23). 
Silicon chip according to one of the preceding 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the silicon chip 

(20) fits on the underside (132) on the counterbearing 
(138) exclusively in an area (131) which lies opposite 

the force-application area (23), and in that the circuits 
(22) are not located in this area (131). 
Silicon chip according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the silicon chip (20) has on the 

underside (144) a trench (141), in that this trench (141) 
is arranged around an area (142), lying opposite the 

force-application area (23), of the underside (144) and 
completely surrounds it, and that the circuits (22) are 

arranged on the non-surrounded area (143). 
Silicon chip according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the surrounded area (142) has a recess (145) in 

the centre starting from the underside (144). 
Silicon chip according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the silicon chip (20) is connected on the underside 

exclusively to an area (161), located at the edge,
