<ABSTRACT>
A device for picking up magnetic metal objects (iron, nickel, etc.) and placing them at a point defined by the user without any manual contact comprises a hollow tube (1) covered at its lower end by a thin cap (6). A rod (3) slides in the tube and is fitted at its lower end with a rectangular or round magnet (2), 1.05 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter, the diameter being slightly smaller than that of the tube. A flared stop collar (7) is crimped around the tube (1) and serves to detach and release the metal objects attached to the outside of the tube (1) which have followed the magnet up to the top of the collar and cannot go beyond said collar as the magnet moves up inside said tube.
