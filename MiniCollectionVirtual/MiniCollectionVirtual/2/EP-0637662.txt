<ABSTRACT>
Composite masonrywork profile, comprising a core which consists of wood or another type of nailable material and is enclosed in an angle profile which consists of metal and leaves the core free on two adjacent sides in order to nail struts or the like thereon. The angle profile comprises two legs which extend transversely with respect to one another and, with the adjoining parts, form the outer walls of an internally formed rectangular tube profile and of which parts extending past the rectangular tube profile are designed as flat tubular profiles, the nailable core bearing against the walls, located within the angle profile, of the rectangular tube profile and of the flat tube profiles.

<CLAIMS>
A composite bricklayer's bar comprising a core (2) of 
wood or another nailable material encased in a metal angle 

section (1) which leaves the core clear on two adjacent sides 
for nailing struts (23, 24) or the like thereon, 
characterized
 
in that the angle section (1) comprises two legs (13, 14) which 

extend transversely to each other and, with the adjacent parts, 
form the outer walls of an internally formed rectangular tube 

section (10), and of which the parts extending beyond the 
rectangular tube section are designed as flat tubular sections 

(8, 9), the nailable core (2) abutting against the walls of the 
rectangular tube section that are located within the angle 

section (1) and the walls of the flat tube sections. 
A composite bricklayer's bar according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the end walls (16, 17) of the flat 
tubular sections (8, 9) are provided with a flange (21, 22) 

partly extending around the core (2). 
A composite bricklayer's bar according to claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the flanges (21, 22) fall into a recess 
provided in the core. 
A composite bricklayer's bar according to claim 1, 2 or 
3, 
characterized
 in that at least one of the flat tube 
sections (8, 9) or the rectangular tube section (10) is provided 

with an inner stiffening wall. 
A composite bricklayer's bar according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the core is fastened 
by means of fastening means (19, 20) extending through at least 

one wall of the flat tubular sections. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the core is composed of a 
portion (7) extending over the major part of the length of the 

section and having at least one separate end piece. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the core is composed of two 
wooden laths (3, 4) arranged with the grain opposite to each  

 
other and connected with each other over the length, which 

wooden core completes the metal angle section (1) to form a 
rectangular section. 
A bricklayer's bar according to claim 6 or 7, 

characterized
 in that the at least one end piece (7) is 
included in the metal section (1) to be slid out of it. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of claims 6, 7 
or 8, 
characterized
 in that the at least one end piece (7) 
extends beyond the end of the metal section (1). 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of claims 6 
through 9, 
characterized
 in that the core portion (2) 
comprises a plurality of superimposed parts. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the metal section (1) is an 
extruded aluminium section. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of claims 9 
through 11, 
characterized
 in that the at least one end piece 
(7) is made of a massive block of nailable material. 
A bricklayer's bar according to anyone of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the core (2) is a wooden core 
provided with one or more saw cuts (25), not visible from the 

outside, which extend transversely to the grains of the wood. 
A bricklayer's bar according to claims 9 through 13, 

characterized
 in that the part of the end piece extending 
beyond the end of the metal section (1) has circumferential 

surfaces which substantially lie in one plane with the 
circumferential surfaces of the rest of the section.
