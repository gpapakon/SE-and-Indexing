<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pyridinium derivatives having a 
potent antagonist activity of the platelet activating factor (PAF). The invention 
also relates to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions 
containing them and to their use in the treatment of diseases in which PAF is 
involved, such as bronchial and allergic asthma, platelet aggregation disorders, 
septic shock, etc, and particularly in the treatment of inflammation. The platelet activating factor (PAF) or (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine), 
also called acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine 
(AGEPC) or PAF-acether, is a natural phospholipid synthesized by different 
cells (basophiles, macrophages, neutrophiles, platelets), and tissues (heart, lung 
and kidney) of the organism. PAF was described for the first time as a potent platelet aggregating agent. 
Later on it was demonstrated to have other biological activities in vivo, such as 
peripheral vasodilatation, increase of the vascular permeability, induction of 
bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity of the respiratory tract. PAF also 
produces immediate hypotension followed by pulmonary and renal 
hypertension in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs, and it has been rated as the 
most potent ulcerogenic agent described until now. Furthermore, PAF has been described as being involved in 
inflammatory processes and it has been suggested that PAF antagonists could be 
useful in the treatment of some inflammatory diseases (Merlos et al., Br. J. 
Pharmacol., 1991,104,990; Kémery et al., Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1989,281,362)
 
   Consequently, PAF is a mediator that is implicated in a large set of 
pathological processes such as asthma, septic shock, transplant rejection, 
thrombosis, ulceration, inflammation and renal diseases. Even though its mechanism of action is still not known with precision, 
several studies show that the biological activities of PAF involve the existence 
of a specific receptor. Recently, the isolation of one of these receptors from 
human platelets has been achieved and it has been identified as a protein with 
a molecular weight of 160,000 daltons. On the other hand, the capacity to inhibit 
the binding of ³H-PAF to its receptors is well correlated with the amount of 
PAF needed to provoke the in vitro and in vivo observed effects. These facts 
indicate that the compounds that act as specific antagonists of PAF could result 
of interest for the treatment of all those pathological processes related directly 
or
