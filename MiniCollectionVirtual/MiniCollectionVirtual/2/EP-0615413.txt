<ABSTRACT>
A ventilated sports shoe, particularly usable for skates which are constituted by a frame (2) for supporting two or more wheels (3) and the shoe (4). The shoe (4) has a plurality of through seats (7) and a plurality of soft pads (8) can be arranged within the seats and protrude inside the shoe, so as to constituted a soft protective region for the user's foot and leg as well as a channel for the air inside the shoe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sports shoe, 
particularly for skates. Conventional skates, for example of the type with two 
or more aligned wheels, are essentially constituted by a 
shoe associated with a wheel supporting frame. The shoe, or boot, is generally constituted by a 
quarter articulated to a shell and is usually made of 
plastics. An innerboot can be arranged inside the shell and the 
quarter, and constitutes a padding element to improve the 
user's comfort. These conventional skates have the drawback that they 
do not allow a transpiration, because the foot is enclosed 
within a substantially tight container, so as to cause 
considerable sweating during the use of the skate. This drawback is strongly felt by the users, since 
this sport is predominantly practiced in summer. As a partial solution to this drawback, a skate with 
aligned wheels is commercially known and comprises a 
plurality of internal ventilation openings. However, in this type of skate it is necessary to use 
an innerboot made of transpiring fabric in order to allow 
adequate ventilation. Even this solution has drawbacks, since in any case 
the air does not optimally flow inside the sports shoe, 
thus limiting beneficial effects for the user. Furthermore, the openings have fixed arrangements and 
sizes and therefore the user is not able to vary the 
degree of ventilation flow according to his own specific  
 
requirements, which are due to the different types of 
sweating of different individuals, to the different types 
of use of the skate, and to the particular season in which 
the skate is used. The aim of the present invention is to overcome the 
drawbacks described above in conventional skates by 
providing a sports shoe which allows optimum ventilation of 
the user's foot. Within the scope of the above aim, an important object 
is to provide a sports shoe in which the user can select 
the degree of ventilation according to his own specific 
requirements or according to requirements related to the 
particular season in which it is used or to the particular 
type of use of the skate (slalom or speed skating). Another important object is to provide a sports shoe 
wherein optimum comfort for the user can be achieved 
together with optimum ventilation. Another important object is to provide a sports shoe 
in which ventilation can affect one or more parts of the 
foot and of the user's leg, said user being able to preset 
and vary these regions. Another object is to provide a ventilated sports shoe 
having low
