<ABSTRACT>
A spatial correction method for a digital image consisting of rows of pixels which are lines or columns, comprises the comparison (E20) of the rows two by two, in order to determine first shifts between rows expressed as an integer number of pixels, the determination of second shifts between rows expressed as a non-integer number of pixels then the determination (E40) for each row of a third shift with respect to a reference row, and finally the correction of each row by a shift of the pixels of this row with respect to the reference equal to the integer part of the third shift of this row and by a spatial smoothing of these pixels with coefficients which are a function of the third shift. This method enhances the quality of the image when the latter has been taken by an aircraft subject to roll and/or drift.

A method for spatial correction of a digital
image made up of a set of rows of pixels (L
1
 to L
N
; C
1

to C
M
) which are lines or columns of the image,
comprising


comparison (E23; E230) of the rows in pairs in
order to determine (E25; E250) first inter-row shifts

(Decmin; DecCmin) expressed as a whole pixel number,

   characterised in that it comprises

determination (E26; E260) of second inter-row
shifts (D
n
; DC
m
) expressed as a non-whole pixel number,
as a function of the first shifts,
determination (E42; E420) for each row (L
n
; C
m
) of
a third shift (Decal
n
; DecalC
m
) of the said row (L
n;

C
m
) with respect to a reference row (L
1
; C
1
) as a
function of the second shifts (D
n
; DC
m
), and
correction of each row (E44; E440) by a shift of
the pixels of said each row with respect to the

reference row equal to the whole part of the third
shift for said each row, and by a spatial smoothing of

the pixels of the said each row with smoothing
coefficients (k
n1
, k
n2
; kC
m1
, kC
m2
) as a function of
the third shift for the said each row.
A correction method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the comparison (E23; E230) of the

rows in pairs comprises for two given rows (L
n
, L
n-1
;
C

, C
m-1
), calculating correlation sums (S
Dec
; S
DecC
)
between the two respectively shifted rows when one is

subjected with respect to the other to predetermined
shifts expressed as a whole pixel number (Dec; DecC),

searching for a minimal correlation sum (S
Decmin
; 
S
DecCmin
) amongst the calculated correlation sums in
order to deduce therefrom the said first shift (Decmin;

DecCmin) between the two rows expressed as a whole
pixel number.
A correction method according to Claim 2,
wherein a correlation sum 
(S
Dec
; S
DecC
) between two
rows shifted by a shift (Dec; DecC) expressed as a

whole pixel number is equal to the sum of the absolute
values of the differences of the values of the pixels

of one row and the values of the pixels shifted by the
said shift (Dec; DecC) of the other row.
A correction method according to either Claim
2 or Claim 3, wherein the determination (E26; E260) of

the second shift between two rows (D
n
; DC
n
) expressed
as a non-whole pixel number is effected by

interpolation of the correlation sums (S
Dec
; S
DecC
) as
a function of the predetermined shifts (Dec; DecC)

between the two rows, by a polynomial function of an
order greater than or equal to 2 around the first shift

(Decmin; DecCmin), the second shift (D
n
; DC
m
) being the
abscissa of a minimum of the interpolation function.
A correction method according to any one of
Claims 1 to 4, wherein the determination (E42; E420)

;
DecalC

) of the said row (L
n
; C
m
) with respect to a
reference row (L

; C

second shifts (D

; DC

) of the rows contained between
the reference row (L
