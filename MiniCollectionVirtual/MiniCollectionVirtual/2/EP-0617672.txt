<ABSTRACT>
A fuel tank arrangement for motor vehicles is constructed as a modular system in which the available fuel space is formed by a number of relatively small tanks which can be connected to each other, and in which the total size of the fuel space is varied by a suitable choice of the number of tanks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel tank arrangement for 
motor vehicles of the type indicated in the preamble to 
patent claim 1 Authorities, customers and truck manufacturers have 
requirements and impose demands on the truck and its fuel 
tanks. The customers want to be able to select a suitable 
tank volume themselves, taking into consideration their 
transport tasks, and often require a larger fuel space 
than can be installed on today's trucks. The truck 
manufacturers have difficulty in meeting the requirements 
of the customers because the space available for fuel 
tanks is limited because of legal requirements specifying 
the maximum permissible vehicle width, because the 
manufacturer must build his vehicle so that its different 
components are accessible during assembly and service, 
and so that additional equipment can be installed, such 
as a loading platform, cabinet or the like, and so that 
the vehicle has sufficient ground clearance. The problem 
of space is intrinsically minor on vehicles with a long 
wheelbase, but is serious and troublesome on vehicles 
with a short wheelbase because available tank space is 
located along the outside of the vehicle frame, between 
the wheel axles. Despite the fact that the problem is 
only encountered in vehicles with a short wheelbase it is 
still a major problem. For not only is the vehicle width 
limited by legal requirements, but the total length of a 
vehicle combination is also limited. This means that in 
order to obtain space for as much load as possible within 
the statutory length the truck owners often use towing 
vehicles with a short wheelbase to which they couple a 
trailer with as long a load length as possible. Since 
towing vehicle combinations are very common and are often  
 
used for long-distance transport the customer demand for 
a large tank volume is highest for these vehicle 
combinations. For reasons of comfort it is also common for vehicles to 
be equipped with pneumatic suspension. This exacerbates 
the space problems mentioned because the pneumatic spring 
systems require special air reservoirs which, because of 
their size, must also be mounted along the outside of the 
vehicle frame, between the wheel axles, and therefore 
encroach upon the available tank space. Vehicle batteries etc. may also be mounted on the frame 
and encroach upon the available space. In practice, therefore, the truck manufacturer has only a 
specific amount of space at his disposal for installing 
the fuel tank. The space has a given length, a given

<CLAIMS>
Fuel tank arrangement for motor vehicles, 
particularly heavy vehicles with at least one fuel 

tank which extends along a vehicle frame (1) between 
wheel axles (6, 7) secured to it, and which is 

connected to the vehicle frame (1) by at least one 
suspension mechanism (57), characterised in that the 

suspension mechanism ((57) is designed with at least 
a first supporting face (8) which, as a result of 

displacement towards a first fuel tank (9), 
interacts with a corresponding first supporting face 

(81) in the tank (9), and is designed with at least 
a second supporting face (86) intended to interact 

with a corresponding second supporting face (87) in 
a second fuel tank 10), which second fuel tank (10) 

is in turn designed to be connected, via suspension 
mechanism (57) and supporting faces (80, 81, 86, 

87), to a third fuel tank (11) and so on, the total 
size of the fuel space being varied by suitable 

selection of the number of fuel tanks (9-12). 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each fuel tank (9-12) is 

designed with two ends, the first supporting face 
(81) of the tank being incorporated at one end, 

whilst its other supporting face (87) is 
incorporated at the other end. 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterised in that one end of the fuel tank (9-12) 

is designed with at least one projection (84), 
whilst other end is designed with at least one 

recess (85), the first supporting face (81) being 
incorporated in the recess (85), whilst the second 

supporting face (87) is incorporated on the 
projection (84).  

 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the suspension mechanism (57) 

is designed with at least projection (102) and at 
least one recess 103), the first supporting face 

(80) of the suspension mechanism (57) being 
incorporated on the projection (102), whilst its 

second supporting face (86) is incorporated in the 
recess (103). 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that the projection (102) of the 

suspension mechanism (57) is designed to slide into 
a corresponding recess (85) in the end of the first 

bank (9), whilst its recess is designed to receive a 
corresponding projection (84) in the end of the 

second tank (10), the supporting faces (80, 81) of 
the suspension mechanism) being brought into contact 

with the supporting faces (81, 87) of the respective 
tanks (9, 10). 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 5, 
characterised in that both the projections (84) and 

the recesses (85) in the tank (9-12), and also the 
projections (102) and recesses (103) in the 

suspension mechanism (9(57), have a conical cross-sectional 
shape. 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the suspension mechanism (57) 

consists of a pressed plate bracket, one side of 
which is designed with continuous projections (1020) 

extending in a triangular shape, and the other side 
of which is designed corresponding continuous 

recesses (103).  
 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claims 1 
characterised in that at least one fastening 

mechanism (92) is arranged to press the supporting 
surfaces (80, 81 and 86, 87 respectively) together. 
Fuel tank arrangement according to claim 8 
characterised in that the fastening mechanism (92) 

incorporates at least one tubular spacer mechanism 
(91), which extends in the longitudinal direction of 

the vehicle between two suspension mechanisms (57), 
and a continuous mechanism (92), which extends 

through the spacer mechanism (91) and whose end 
sections (94) are each connected to their own 

suspension mechanism (57), in that the spacer 
mechanism (91) is slightly shorter, in the 

longitudinal direction of the vehicle, that the 
respective fuel tanks (9-12), and in that locking 

mechanisms (96) are arranged on the continuous 
mechanism (92) for pressing the suspension 

mechanisms against the spacer mechanism, the 
supporting faces also being pressed together.
