<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a drill (10), 
preferably for metal cutting, including a substantially 

solid shank (12) having a first tip end (14), including 
at least one cutting edge, a second opposite end (16) 

and an intermediate portion (20) located between the 
first tip end (14) and the second opposite end (16), a 

number of flutes (22) corresponding to the number of 
cutting edges, said flutes (22) extending helically 

from the tip end (14) to the intermediate portion (20) 
of the shank (12). 
The cross-sectional area of the flutes (22) increases 
gradually from the tip end (14) to the intermediate 

portion (20) and the helix angle (α) decreases 
gradually from the tip end (14) to the intermediate 

portion (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drill according 
to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 and as known 
for example from DE-C-159437. Drills of the type defined above are used for metal 
cutting and specifically for drilling holes in metallic 
workpieces. During the metal cutting operation chips 
are produced at the tip end of the shank of the drill, 
said chips being formed and transported from the tip 
end of the shank of the drill to the opposite end of 
the shank of the drill, said transport taking place in 
the flutes. In order to improve the transport of chips in the 
flutes it is previously known from EP-A-0 549 548 to 
have an abrupt increase of the cross-sectional area of 
the portion of the helical flutes that transports the 
chips compared to the portion of the helical flutes 
that forms the chips. However, such an increase of the 
cross-sectional area reduces the velocity of the 
cutting fluid that carries the chips and this will 
negatively affect the chip transport. Since material is 
removed when the cross-sectional area of the flutes is 
increased the rigidity of the drill is reduced. From Japanese patent document No. 3-142116 a drill is 
previously known having flutes with a cross-sectional  
 
area that increases in a direction away from the tip of 
the drill. However, the flutes have partially a helical 
extension partially a straight extension. This design 
does not provide an optimum transport of the chips. 
Also the same reduction of rigidity as for EP-A-0 549 
548 applies. The aim of the present invention is to achieve an 
optimum transport of chips in a drill of the type 
defined above, said transport being effected by cutting 
fluid that travels in the flutes and carries the chips 
while avoiding to reduce the rigidity of the drill. 
The pumping effect of the flutes is balanced by the 
decrease of flute length. The aim of the invention is 
realized by a drill that has been given the 
characteristics of the appending claims. Below an embodiment of the invention will be described, 
reference being made to the accompanying drawings where 
Fig.1 shows a side view of a drill according to the 
present invention; Fig.2a shows a section along IIa-IIa 
in Fig.1; Fig.3a shows a section along IIIa-IIIa in 
Fig.1; Fig.4a shows a section along IVa-IVa in Fig.1; 
Fig.2b shows a section along IIb-IIb in Fig.1; Fig.3b 
shows a section along IIIb-IIIb in Fig.1; and Fig.4b 
shows a section along IVb-IVb in Fig.1. The drill 10 according to Fig.1 includes a shank 12

Drill (10), preferably for metal cutting, including 
a substantially solid shank (12) having a first tip end 

(14), including at least one cutting edge, a second 
opposite end (16) and an intermediate portion (20) 

located between the first tip end (14) and the second 
opposite end (16), a number of flutes (22) 

corresponding to the number of cutting edges, said 
flutes (22) extending from the tip end (14) to the 

intermediate portion (20) of the shank (12), wherein 
the available volume

(α) of the flutes (22) decreases gradually from the tip 

end (14) to the intermediate portion (20) and that, in 
cross-sections (Figs.2a-4a) lying in planes 

perpendicular to a longitudinal centre axis (13) of the 
shank (12), lands (24), that bridges the flutes (22),

flutes (22) in the circumferential direction. 
Drill according to claims 1,

being equal to the helix angle (α) in an area where the 
perpendicular plane intersects the longitudinal centre 

axis (13).
