<ABSTRACT>
The louvre-type roller shutter has at least one pull chain, whose links (2) are hinged together and connected with tiltable, lamella-like slats (1), and at least one adjustment chain, whose links (5) are hinged together and connected with the slats (1). The adjustment chain links (5) overlap the pull chain links (2), and preferably the slats (1) also at least partially overlap the pull chain links (2). As a result, there are no cracks in the shutter, the shutter has a very compact design and the slats show a uniform cross-section throughout.

Roller shutter according to one of claims 9 to 11, 
characterised in that the connecting joints (40, 42) 

between the tension chain links (2) and the adjusting 
chain links (5) are constructed to be displaceable in the 

direction of movement of the roller shutter. 
Roller shutter according to one of claims 8 to 12, 
characterised in that there is provided, at the lower 

longitudinal edge of the blind slats (1) and/or of the
