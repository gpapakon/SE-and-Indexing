<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and a method for evaluating the plane strain stretch formability for thin steel sheets used in automative bodies, so that manufacturing factories and stamping shops can easily evaluate the plane strain stretch formability. The apparatus includes: a lower die (10) and an upper die (9) with a lock bead (8) installed thereon. A test specimen is inserted into between the upper and lower dies (9) and (10), and is clamped by means of the lock bead (8) along the circumferential edge of said test specimen, so that the material of the test specimen should be mobilized into the upper die (9). Then a punch is elevated to apply a stretch forming force on the test specimen, and then, the plane strain stretch formability is evaluated based on the fracture limit punch height at the instant of the fracture. The punch has a saddle-like semi-cylindrical shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for, and
methods of, evaluating the plane strain stretch formability
of materials, such as the stamping formability for thin
steel sheets used in manufacturing automotive bodies. In
particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus
and a method for evaluating the stretch formability
referring to the fracture limit under the plane strain mode
which leads to the greater part of fractures occurring
during the stamping process for automotive steel sheets.Generally, the manufacturing process for automotive
bodies includes stamping, welding, coating and assembling.
In the stamping process, which is the first step of the
manufacturing process, drawing, trimming and flanging are
carried out by passing material through three or four
stamping dies. The formation defects such as fractures,
buckling and the like which occur during the drawing step
have influence over the later processes. As a result, the
quality of the final products is degraded, and the
productivity is lowered, thereby leading to increase in the
manufacturing cost. The drawing step of the stamping
process, which plays the critical role in forming the
automotive body will be described referring to the attached
drawings, for the case where a single acting press is used.
As shown in Figure 1, a steel sheet 5 to be subjected to
formation is inserted between a lower die 3 and an upper
die 1 having a draw bead 4. Then the upper die 1 is
lowered, so that it provides a suitable force to the steel
sheet 5 by the aid of the reaction force of a cushion 6
which supports the lower die 3. At the same time,
as shown in Figure 2, the lower die 3 is lowered
to the depth of the panel to be formed. As the 
lower die 3 is lowered, the steel sheet 5 which is
positioned between the upper die 1 and the lower die 3
passes through the draw bead 4 to be put into the upper die
1, so that the steel sheet should be formed in accordance
with the shape of a punch 2, thereby completing the
stamping process. However, as shown by the portion A of
Figure 2, fractures can occur on the wall of the formed
panel during the drawing process. The occurring of such
fractures is very sensitively affected by the mechanical
properties of the steel sheet, the design of the dies,
and other stamping conditions.The deformation which occurs to the steel sheet
during the stamping process includes stretching and drawing
deformations, and, in the former, the material is not
permitted to be mobilized at the flange portion by the lock
bead, while, in

Apparatus for evaluating a plane strain stretch
formability of thin steel sheet material, the apparatus

comprising:

a lower die (10) and a mating upper die (9) having a
circularly-configured lock bead (8) for clamping a

therebetween; and
a punch (21) moveable to apply a force on the test
specimen (7);

   characterized in that the punch (21) has a saddle-like,
semi-cylindrical shape whereby the punch (21) is

positionable with its lengthwise direction aligned with the
width direction of the test specimen (7).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the edges
(21a,21b) of said punch (21) at the opposed ends are

rounded with a particular curvature.

   a rectangular test specimen (7) is inserted between a
lower die (10) and a mating upper die (9) having a

circularly-configured lock bead (8); said test specimen (7)
