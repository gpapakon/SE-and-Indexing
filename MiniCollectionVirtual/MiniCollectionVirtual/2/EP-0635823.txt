<ABSTRACT>
A rotary transformer includes a rotary magnetic 
member (11a), a stationary magnetic member (11b), and a 

plurality of coils (13a, 13b, 14a, 14b, 16a, 16b). These 
two magnetic members have respective counter surfaces 

opposing to each other with a small space (S) interposed 
therebetween. A plurality of pairs of coil grooves (12a, 

12b) opposing to each other for receiving the plurality of 
coils on the two counter surfaces are provided. At the 

same time, a plurality of wiring grooves (18a, 18b) are 
formed so as to cross the coil grooves to join the same. 

A pair of lead lines extending from one of the coils (13a, 
13b, 14a, 14b) disposed in the coil grooves are drawn out 

outside of the rotary transformer without crossing other 
coils simultaneously transferring signals in the wiring 

groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary transformer in accordance with the
precharacterizing part of claim 1. Such a rotary transformer is included in a rotary
magnetic head device used in a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus such as a
video tape recorder, and more particularly, to a rotary transformer which can reduce
crosstalk of a rotary magnetic head device also in a high frequency region. A rotary
transformer of this type is, for example, known from Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol 8,
no: 139, (E-253 ), 28.06.1984 corresponding to JP-A-59 048 906.A performance of a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus has recently been
improved. Accordingly, a rotary transformer transferring a signal between a rotary
magnetic head unit and a stationary signal processing unit tends to include multiple
channels. It is desired that crosstalk of a record/reproduction signal between
channels of such a rotary transformer is reduced even in a high frequency region.Fig. 15 is a vertical sectional view of a conventional cylinder type rotary transformer.
Fig. 16 is a vertical sectional view of a conventional disc type rotary transformer.
Each of these rotary transformers includes a rotary magnetic member 1a and a
stationary magnetic member 1b. Rotary magnetic member 1a is coupled 
to a rotary drum (not shown in Figs. 15 and 16) disposed
thereabove, and stationary magnetic member 1b is fixed to
a stationary drum (not shown in Figs. 15 and 16) disposed
thereunder. A through hole 7 provided along the center
axis of these two magnetic members 1a, 1b receives a
rotary axis for a rotary drum.Rotary magnetic member 1a and stationary magnetic
member 1b have respective counter surfaces opposing to
each other with a small space interposed therebetween. A
plurality of rotary coil grooves 2a are formed on the
counter surface of rotary magnetic member 1a, and a
plurality of stationary coil grooves 2b are formed on the
counter surface of stationary magnetic member 1b. Each of
the plurality of rotary coil grooves 2a is opposed to a
corresponding one of the plurality of stationary coil
grooves 2b. Signal transfer rotary coils 3a and 4a are
disposed in corresponding rotary coil groove 2a.
Similarly, signal transfer stationary coils 3b and 4b are
disposed in corresponding stationary coil groove 2b. Lead
lines 3A and 4A from rotary coils 3a and 4a are drawn out
upward through a wiring groove 8a provided in the
direction orthogonal to coil groove 2a on the counter
surface of rotary magnetic member 1a toward the rotary
drum. Lead lines
