<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method for detecting retention 
faults in each of a plurality of read/write memory elements (12
1
-12
z
), arranged in a 
plurality of banks (14
1
-14
k
) coupled in daisy chain fashion. Retention faults are 
detected, in accordance with the method, by signaling the banks in sequence, at each 

of three separate intervals, to cause the memory elements in each bank to execute a 
first, second and third sequence of read and/or write instructions. Execution of the 

second sequence of read and/or write operations is delayed so each memory element 
can be read after a prescribed interval to detect a first bit pattern written in each 

memory at the end of the first sequence. Similarly, execution of the third sequence 
of read and/or write operations is delayed so each memory element can be read after 

a prescribed interval to detect a second bit, complementary to the first pattern, 
written in the memory element at the end of the second sequence. By delaying the 

execution of the second and third sequences of read and/or write operations, 
retention faults, if any, can manifest themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique for detecting retention faults in 
memory elements in an integrated circuit Many integrated circuits are now fabricated with at least one read/write 
memory element that is capable of reading and writing data, such as a Random 
Access Memory (RAM), a Content Addressable Memory (CAM), a First-In, First-Out 
(FIFO) register or a Register File (RF), for example. Each read/write memory 
element in an integrated circuit is commonly tested to detect different types of faults 
by causing the memory element to execute a sequence of read and write operations 
unique to the particular type of memory to be tested. Among the faults sought to be 
detected during testing of a read/write memory element are retention faults. A 
retention fault occurs when a memory cell in the read/write memory element is 
unable to hold a value, such as a binary "1" or "0," over time. The most common technique presently used to detect retention faults is 
to initiate execution by the memory element of its particular sequence of read and 
write operations. The sequence of operations is typically interrupted at each of two 
points for a predetermined interval (e.g., 100 milliseconds) to enable the retention 
faults, if any, to manifest themselves. The exact point at which the sequence of read 
and write operations should be interrupted depends on the nature of the memory 
element being tested. The above-described retention fault testing scheme is not autonomous 
because the sequence of read and write operations must be manually interrupted to 
allow retention faults to manifest themselves. As indicated, the exact point at which 
the interruption should occur is dependent on the nature of the memory element 
being tested. Thus, the intervention of a test engineer during testing is generally 
required. The above-described retention fault testing scheme is not unified 
because the sequence of read and write operations executed by each memory must be 
interrupted twice before another successive memory can execute its particular 
sequence of read and write operations. Accordingly, retention fault testing is thus 
delayed by the interruption interval allocated to each memory to allow for its  
 
retention faults (if any) to manifest themselves. Since the interruption (delay) 
interval is cumulative, the testing of a large number of memories in a single 
integrated circuit in succession thus becomes a lengthy process, leading to a long test 
time for the circuit. Thus, there is a need for a retention fault

write operations, the second sequence including a read operation which is executed 

by each memory at the beginning of the second sequence to read itself to determine 
if the first pattern of bits is present, and a write operation, which upon execution, 

causes a second pattern of bits, complementary to the first pattern, to be present in 
the memory element at the completion of the second sequence of operations; and
