contraceptive protection comprising a mixture of a 

contraceptive effective amount of spermicidal agent, a 
polymeric gum, a dispersing agent, and a water miscible 

polyethylene glycol polymer suppository base; and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a long lasting contraceptive 
suppository composition. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a contraceptive suppository 
composition comprising a spermicide and a viscous adhesive 
composition which provides long lasting contraceptive 
action. Conventional vaginal contraceptive products utilizing a 
spermicidal agent provide a very limited duration of 
contraception. Conventional methods of spermicidal 
contraception require that the products need to be 
inserted into the vagina not more than one hour preferably 
10-30 minutes before coitus for suppository products and 
even less time for foam and gel products. In view of such 
time constraints these products must be reapplied if 
coitus is repeated more than one hour after the original 
insertion. While various attempts have been made in the 
art to provide a longer lasting and more convenient 
vaginal contraceptive spermicidal suppository, they have 
met with only limited success. Riley, Jr. et al. in U.S. Patent 4,551,148 describe a 
vaginal delivery system which is allegedly bio-adherent to 
the vaginal surface and releases an active agent in a 
controlled manner for at least three hours to a receptor 
site. Foamable-type vaginal suppository compositions have 
also been developed, but such have not been found to 
provide effective contraceptive activity for long periods  
 
of time. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a novel vaginal contraceptive suppository which 
has a long period of contraceptive activity and is highly 
effective in preventing conception due to coitus for up to 
12 hours after initial insertion of the suppository. The foregoing object of providing a long lasting vaginal 
contraceptive suppository has now been accomplished in 
accordance with the compositions and methods of the 
present invention. In accordance with the purposes of the invention, as 
embodied and fully described herein, the invention 
comprises a long lasting contraceptive suppository 
composition comprising a mixture of a contraceptive 
effective amount of spermicidal agent; a polymeric gum; a 
dispersing agent; and a water-miscible polyethylene glycol 
polymer suppository base. The polymeric gum provides 
viscous adhesive qualities to the mixture. The dispersing 
agent contributes homogeneous melt and spread 
characteristics to the mixture and acts to absorb and hold 
the spermicidal agent to provide a controlled release of 
the agent over several hours. In preferred embodiments of the composition of
