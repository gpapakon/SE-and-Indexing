<DESCRIPTION>
 2,6-Methano-2H-qu1nolizin derivative as 5-HT3-receptor antagonistThis invention relates to 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2,2- dimethylbenzofuran-7-carboxylie acid-octahydro-3-hydroxy- 5 2,6-methano-2H-quinolizin-8-yl ester, a novel 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, its method of preparation, and to its end-use application in the treatment of conditions responsive to 5-HT3 receptor antagonism such as radio- and chemo-therapeu¬ tically-induced nausea and vomiting, •__■«• the treatment of10 pain associated with migraine, in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, the treatment of hallucinatory endogenous psychoses of the type manifested in patients suffering from schizophrenia and mania, the treatment of irritable or inflammatory bowel syndrome, or to15 combat drug abuse.More specifically this invention relates to compounds of the formula
its tautomers, stereo- and geometrical isomers, and mixtures thereof, and to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.As used herein, the wavy line bonding the oxygen atom of the ester moiety to the 8-position of the octahydro-2,6-methano- 2H-quinolizin moiety (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the methano bridged quinolizinyl moiety) indicates that the bonding may be in the endo (trans) or the exo (cis) configuration. The preferred configuration is endo.Preparation of such geometric isomers may be effected by the processes and techniques of U.S. Patent 4,906,755 which is incorporated herein by reference. A chirality exists at the 3-position of the methano-bridged quinolizinyl moiety presenting d- or 1-isomers and racemate mixtures thereof. When desired resolution of said racemates may be effected by standard procedures and techniques well known in the art. The (+) enantiomer is preferred.The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts referred to above can be non-toxic salts with suitable acids such as those with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids; or with organic acids such as organic carboxylic acids r for example, acetic, propionic, glycolic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, malic, tartaric, citric, salicylic, 2-acetyl- oxybenzoic, nicotinic or isonicotinic; or organic sulfonic acids, for example, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 2- hydroxyethanesulfonic, 4-toluenesulfonic or 2-naphthalene- sulfonic.The preparation of the compounds of the present invention may be illustrated by the following example.
