<ABSTRACT>
A control thermostat (1) is connected to a liquid 
cooling system of an internal combustion engine. The 

control thermostat (1) has an inlet side housing (11), an outlet 
side housing (10), both the housing being communicated with 

each other to form a valve passage therein, a thermo-actuator (2) 
provided in the valve passage, a valve (17) operated 

by the thermo-actuator (2). The inlet side housing (11) and the 
outlet side housing (10) are communicated with coolant 

passages of the liquid cooling system so that a part of 
the coolant in the cooling system flows from the inlet 

side housing (11) to the outlet side housing (10) passing through 
the valve passage. The thermo-actuator (2) is arranged so 

as to close the valve (17) when the coolant temperature is 
higher than a predetermined temperature. A jacket (41) is 

provided for transmitting heat of the coolant discharged 
from the outlet side housing (10) to an element of the 

internal combustion engine, whereby controlling 
temperature of the element to a constant value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid cooling system for
elements of an internal combustion engine, according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such a system is known from US-A-4 679 530.US-A-4,351,284 discloses a liquid cooling system for an internal
combustion engine with an outlet water line of the water jacket
of the engine being led to a heat exchanger transversed by the
tube of the intake manifold. The water from the heat exchanger
is led back through a return water line. The water jacket is
further connected to a radiator for cooling the water. A
temperature controlled plenum valve is disposed upstream of the
heat exchanger so that it operates dependent on the temperature
of the coolant in the upstream of the thermo-actuator. The
temperature control of the valve is realised by a bi-metallic
disc operating in dependency of the temperature of the coolant
upstream of the thermo-actuator so that it closes after the
warm-up of the engine.It is also proposed to arrange the above-mentioned plenum wall
downstream of the heat exchanger with an orifice in the bi-metallic
disc so that a metered flow passes through the disc.
This bears the danger that the heat exchanger has a temperature
introduced by the volume passing through the disc which is
higher than desired.WO 91/05148 discloses a conventional liquid cooling system for
elements of an internal combustion engine. Water drawn out from
an outlet of the water jacket of the engine is led through a
thermostat and then further led to different elements, like a
turbo charger, a conduction manifold, a heater matrix for the
interior of a car and is then led back to an inlet of the water
jacket. One line from the thermostat leads to a radiator and is
then led back to the water jacket of the engine.It is the object of the present invention to provide a liquid
cooling system for elements of an internal combustion engine by 
which the temperature of the elements may be controlled to a
predetermined constant value irrespective of engine operation
conditions providing an effective controlling of the temperature
avoiding large fluctuations, and which has a simple construction
which is easy to manufacture.According to the present invention, this is attained by a liquid
cooling system with the features of claim 1.With this liquid cooling system, an element of an internal
combustion engine can be kept at a constant temperature without
too much fluctuation. The valve seat is with the inlet side
housing while the thermo-actuator is provided in the outlet side
housing.
