 SELF-COMPENSΛ TNG DIGITAL DELAY SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE 1TII SELECTΛBLE OUTPUT DELAYS AND METHOD THEREFORRELATED APPLICATIONThis patent application is a continuation-in-part of our earlier parent patent application entitled "COMPENSATED DIGITAL DELAY SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH SELECTABLE OUTPUT TAPS AND METHOD THEREFOR", U.S. Serial No. 07/836,078; filed February 14, .1992, and in the same inventor names as the inventors of this patent application and the parent parent application is incorporated herein by reference thereto.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention generally relates to semiconductor dev Lees and methods, and, more specifically, relates to a digital delay semiconductor device with selectable output delays and method therefor which provides several precise delays of the digital input signal, any one of which can be selected by asserting the appropriate control inputs to the "tap enable multiplexer, which routes the desired delay to the output. This device and method includes self-compensation to correct for variations in manufacturing process, temperature and power supply variations such that the delay from digital input signal to the selected tap remains constant within a relatively tight tolerance. 

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTThe prior art provided various types of digits I. delay semiconductor devices and methods for providing the needed delays to satisfy timing parameters in a digits] electronic system. One example of a system that requires specific delays is the- refresh circuitry for Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) device:-;. The problem with the prior art devices is that the delay from input to output varied considerably with variations in manυ l .icturing process, operating temperature and power supply voltage. This problem was generally solved by designing the system arc itecture to eliminate the need for precise and constant delay..;, which generally resulted in a reduction of performance and flexibility of the system.Therefore, there existed a need to provide a digital delay semiconductor device and method with selectable output delays which is self-compensated such that the each output, delay is held relatively constant with respect to variations in manufacturing process, temperature and power supply voltage.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide an improved digital delay semiconductor device with selectable output: delays and method therefor which provides a plurality of output', delays with respect to a digital input signal, any one of which can
