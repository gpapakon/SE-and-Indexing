<ABSTRACT>
An automatic transmission control system for 
an automotive vehicle comprising fluid pressure 

operated clutch and brake servos that establish and 
disestablish plural torque delivery paths between the 

engine of the vehicle and a driven member, the control 
system having a pressure regulator for maintaining an 

optimum pressure level, a throttle solenoid valve, 
ratio shift controlling solenoid valves and means for 

replacing the functions of the throttle solenoid valve 
and the shift controlling solenoid valves in the event 

that a control voltage failure or a valve malfunction 
should occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is adapted to be used in an electronically controlled automatic transmission.The control system
has features that are
common to the control system of U.S. Patent 4,509,389
which also is assigned to the assignee of this
invention.The '389 patent discloses a control system
for a multiple ratio transmission having clutch and
brake servos that are operated sequentially to effect
plural torque transfer paths between an engine and the
driven member of the vehicle. It includes a valve
circuit having a main regulator valve for establishing
the optimum pressure level for the servos under
varying operating conditions and driver demands. The
valve circuit includes multiple shift valves for
sequentially actuating and releasing the servos to
effect torque ratio changes. The shift valves respond
to a fluid pressure governor signal and to a manual
throttle valve output signal, the latter being
representative of engine torque, and the former being
representative of vehicle speed.The disclosure of the aforementioned patent
application differs from the control circuit of the
'389 patent because it does not include a manually
operable mechanical throttle valve system nor a fluid 
pressure governor driven by the driven member of the
transmission. Instead, the shift valves are
controlled by solenoid operated valves which trigger
shifting movement of the shift valves between upshift
and downshift positions as the solenoid valves respond
to a microprocessor electronic control circuit.
Further, the mechanical throttle valve system has been
replaced by a throttle valve solenoid valve which also
responds to signals developed by the microprocessor
control circuit.The main regulator valve of the control
system of the aforementioned patent application, as in
the case of the system of the '389 patent, responds to
the torque signal to develop the desired circuit
pressure. If the throttle valve solenoid pressure
signal should not be available because of a loss of
control voltage or because of a valve malfunction, the
line pressure maintained by the main regulator valve
may be insufficient to satisfy the capacity demands of
the clutch and brake servos. Furthermore, the output
signals from the shift solenoid valves would be
unavailable for appropriately controlling the
transmission ratios if those valves fail to function
properly or if a voltage failure occurs. US Patent 4 919 012 shows a throttle valve system for an
automatic transmission control circuit comprising a solenoid
pilot valve and a pressure regulating throttle
