<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a polymeric film coated 
with polyamido-polyethyleneimine to render the film receptive to 

direct extrusion coating with other polymers or to ink adhesion 
and to a method of making the same. Additionally, the polyamido-polyethyleneimine 

coated polymeric film has improved anti-static 
properties. The polymeric film is preferably an oriented 

polyester film, and the polyamido-polyethyleneimine coating is 
preferably applied in-line. The films are suitable for use in 

packaging applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric film coated on at least one
side with an aqueous based amido-modified polyethyleneimine (hereinafter
referred to as polyamido-polyethyleneimine) primer coating composition. In
particular, the present invention concerns oriented polymeric film coated (i.e. as
one of the steps in the film formation process prior to heat setting of the film)
with an aqueous based polyamido-polyethyleneimine, which renders the film
more receptive to direct extrusion coating with other polymer layers, and to ink
adhesion.Oriented polymeric film, and particularly biaxially oriented polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) film, has been widely used in packaging materials, magnetic
tape applications, glazing applications, and reprographic film applications. It has
good optical clarity, toughness and static properties which renders the film
extremely suitable for these applications.A major use of polymeric film is in lamination with other polymers.
Often polyester film is extrusion coated with polyethylene, for example, to
provide heat sealing or other properties not possible with polyester alone.
Unfortunately, unprimed polymeric film is not very receptive to extrusion coating
with other polymers. Most polymeric film is substantially inert and adhesion
between the unprimed polymeric film and other extrusion coated polymers is
poor.Numerous primer coatings are known in the field for application to
polymeric film to improve the adhesion of the film to various polymeric
materials. Examples of such coatings include compositions based on vinylidene
chloride polymers (U.S. patent No. 2,698,240), thermosetting acrylic or
methacrylic polymers (U.S. Pat. No. 4,571,363), polyethyleneimine (U.S. Patent
5,156,904) and like materials. Certain water dispersible co-polyesters have also
been disclosed as adhesives for laminating sheets of polyester film to one
another or to sheets of nylon film as taught in U.S. Patent No.s 3,563,942 and
3,779,993. Corona discharge treatment is also used with and 
without such primer coatings to achieve adhesion between the polymeric film
and the extruded polymer layer.In common practice, polyethyleneimine is used as an adhesive coating
between various polymeric films, such as polypropylene film and other polymers
as taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,139,643 to Hix et al. The use of
polyethyleneimine as an adhesive between cellophane and polyethylene is
known from US Reissue Patent No. 28,554 issued to Curler et al. Coating
