<ABSTRACT>
The process for the fabrication of a container (9) with a flexible inner bag (5) contained therein and fastened on the bottom (8) of the container (9) includes the following steps:   Fabricating the container (9) preferably by the blow-moulding process and forming a hole (10) in the bottom region (8) of the container, which can be performed during the blow moulding or thereafter, fabricating a blank (1) of the inner bag (5), preferably by the injection-moulding process, the blank (1) having at the open end of its tubular wall section an annular stopper (6), on a side of which there is injection-moulded a folding bottom cover (11), holding the blank (1) on a blowing mandrel and introducing the blank (1) through the bottom hole (10) into the container (9) and subsequently inflating the blank (1), so that the inner bag (5) formed in this way bears against the inside walls of the container (9). Thereafter, the stopper section (6) of the inner bag is welded ultrasonically on to the bottom (8) of the container, so that a permanently reliable sealing of the container interior is produced here. The inner bag (5) is made to collapse by negative pressure and/or positive pressure, so that it detaches itself from the inside walls of the container. The container receives liquid, which is preferably discharged by means of an airless pump (17), air entering into the inner bag through a through-hole of the cover bottom inserted into the annular stopper section (11), having the effect of constant pressure equalisation.

A method of producing a container containing a flexible inner bag, in which the filling
substance is delivered from a container opening and the pressure equalisation takes place

upon delivery of the filling substance such that air entering does not come into contact
with the filling substance, with the following steps:


producing the container and forming a hole in the bottom region of the container;
introducing a parison into the container;
blowing the parison, so that the inner bag thus formed is applied to the inner walls of the
container, and securing the inner bag to the container in 
a durable and sealed manner,
characterised in that
the parison is introduced into the container through the hole in the bottom and secured to
the edge of the hole in the bottom.
Method according to claim 1,

characterised in that the hole in the bottom is formed while the container is blow-moulded.
Method according to claim 1,

characterised in that the hole in the bottom is formed after the container has been blow-moulded.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the parison is produced in an injection moulding method, wherein an
annular stopper section is injection-moulded on its open end.
Method according to claim 4,

characterised in that a bottom cover with a through-bore is injection-moulded on the
annular stopper section.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the parison is heated on the blow mandrel before the blow-moulding
operation. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that a hot-melt ring (18) is placed on the edge of the hole in the bottom of
the container before the parison is introduced into the container.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that the moulded-on annular stopper is welded to the container bottom
during or after the blow moulding operation.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that an underpressure is exerted through the hole in the bottom and/or an
overpressure through the container neck in order to contract or compress the inner bag

after the annular stopper has been secured to the container bottom.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that the moulded-on bottom cover is gripped, flipped over and inserted in
the annular stopper section of the inner bag.
