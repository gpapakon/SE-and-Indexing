<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to naphthyloxyacetic acid
derivatives, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical
compositions containing them.As prostaglandin (PG)E2 agonists, many compounds have been
known including PGE2perse or its derivatives. However, no
compounds which antagonize PGE2 or inhibit PGE2 activity have
been known until now.PGE2 has been known as a metabolite in the arachidonate
cascade. Its known activities include uterine contractile
activity, a pain-inducing effect, a promoting effect on
digestive peristalsis, an awaking effect, a suppressive effect
on gastric acid secretion, and hypotensive activity. Antagonist
or agonist activites on these effects would be expected to
confer the following activities on a compound.To antagonize PGE2 means to suppress the effects above
mentioned, so PGE2 antagonists are considered to inhibit uterine
contraction, to have analgetic action, to inhibit digestive
peristalsis, or to induce sleep. Therefore, PGE2 antagonists are
considered to be useful as analgesics, antidiarrheals, sleep
inducers or for the prevention of abortion.To agonize for PGE2 means to promote the effects above
mentioned, so PGE2 agonists are considered to stimulate uterine
contraction, to promote digestive peristalsis, to suppress
gastric acid secretion, or to lower blood pressure. Therefore,
PGE2 agonists are considered to be useful as abortifacients,
cathartics, and antiulcer, anti-gastritis or antihypertensive 
agents.The present invention accordingly provides
naphthyloxyacetic acid derivatives of the formula (I):
wherein R1 is (i) -COOR4 in which R4 is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl,
(ii) -CONR5R6 in which R5 and R6 each, independently, is hydrogen,
C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkyl substituted by a hydroxy group or (iii)
-CH2OH;

in which A is a bond or C1-4 alkylene, or
in which A is
 
in which m is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, n is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and m + n
is 2, 3 or 4;B is -NR3SO2- or -SO2NR3- in which R3 is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl or
-CH2COOR7 in which R7 is hydrogen or a group R4a in which R4a is
C1-4 alkyl;R2 is (i) C1-6 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl or C2-6 alkynyl, or(ii) C1-6 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl or C2-6 alkynyl substituted by
one, two, or three substituents selected from phenyl, C4-7
cycloalkyl or phenyl substituted by one, two or three
substituents selected from C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy or halogen
and
in the formula
---- is a single bond or double bond;
or a non-toxic salt thereof.In the formula (I), C1-4 alkyl represented by R3, R4, R4a,
R5, R6, means methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and isomeric groups
thereof.I
