<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a tread portion (5), 
said tread portion (5) provided with a main groove 

(10) extending continuously in the circumferential 
direction of the tyre and circumferentially spaced 

lateral grooves (11A,11B) each extending axially 
from the main groove (10) to one side of the main 

groove, defining pitches between the intersections 
of said lateral grooves (11A,11B) with the main 

groove (10), the pitches including at least two 
different length pitches (P1,P2), the width (GW) of 

the main groove (10) at the groove top being 
substantially constant along its length, and 

characterised in that the sectional area of the main 
groove is changed along its length such that 


{S(i+1)--S(i)} / S(i) 
is 0.5 to 1.5 times 

{P(i+1)--P(i)} / P(i) 
wherein
 

S(i) is the sectional area in one pitch having a 
length P(i) and S(i+1) is the sectional area in the 

next longer pitch having a length P(i+1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
having an improved tread portion capable of reducing 
the running noise. In recent years, as the expressway network is 
developed and the vehicle performance is remarkably 
improved, block patterns and block-rib patterns, 
each of which include circumferentially extending 
straight or generally straight wide main grooves, 
are widely used for their superior drainage 
performance and road grip performance. As a tread pattern including blocks generates much 
noise when running on a well-paved roads at high 
speed, such tyres are now required to have reduced 
running noise. During running, tread blocks repeatedly contact with 
the ground and generate impact sound. Also the 
tread blocks are repeatedly detached from the 
ground, and the blocks are vibrated. Further, 
lateral grooves connected with the main groove are 
changed in the volume, and pulsative sound is 
generated from the lateral grooves.  
 As a result, the air existing in the tubes formed 
between the ground and the main grooves in the 
ground contacting patch, is excited by the above-mentioned 
impact sound, vibrations and pulsative air 
flow, and the air resonates at a certain frequency 
(about 800 to 1250 Hz) to generate so called air 
resonance noise. If the depth of the main grooves is decreased, such 
a resonance noise can be reduced, but wet 
performance is greatly decreased. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre in which, by decreasing 
the air resonance, the running noise of the tyre is 
effectively reduced without sacrificing wet 
performance. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprising a tread portion, said 
tread portion provided with a main groove extending 
continuously in the circumferential direction of the 
tyre and circumferentially spaced lateral grooves 
each extending axially from the main groove to one 
side of the main groove, defining pitches between 
the intersections of said lateral grooves with the  
 
main groove, the pitches including at least two 
different length pitches, the width of the main 
groove at the groove top being substantially 
constant along its length, characterised in that the 
sectional area of the main groove is changed along 
its length such that 
{S(i+1)-S(i)} / S(i)  
is 0.5 to 1.5 times 
{P(i+1)-P(i)} / P(i)  
wherein 
S(i) is the sectional area in one pitch having a 
length P(i) and S(i+1) is the sectional area in the 
next longer pitch having a length P(i+1).
