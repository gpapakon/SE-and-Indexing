<ABSTRACT>
An image printer (1) includes a developing unit (D) for 
developing an exposed photosensitive material (3), a 

plurality of transport members (20-23,40-43) for transporting the 
photosensitive material to the developing unit through 

exposing positions (E1-E3) provided respectively in a 
plurality of photosensitive-material transport 

passages arranged in parallel to each other, and a 
plurality of projection exposure units (P1,P2) for exposing a 

film image on to the photosensitive material. The 
projection units are provided respectively for the 

exposing positions of the transport members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer.As an image printer for exposing a film image on
to a photosensitive material, there is well-known an
image printer having a projection exposure unit for
projecting and exposing the film image on to the
photosensitive material and a developing unit for
developing the photosensitive material exposed at the
projection exposure unit.This type of image printer further includes
transport means for transporting the photosensitive
material through an exposing position of the
projection exposure unit to the developing unit. In
operation, the photosensitive material, as being
transported by this transport means, undergoes a
series of processes from the exposure process of the 
film image to the developing process.According to the above-described conventional
construction, however, the image printer has only one
projection exposure unit and also only one transport
means for transporting the photosensitive material
through the projection exposure unit. Hence, for
increasing the film exposure processing capacity, it
has been necessary for a user to purchase a plurality
of units of the image printers of the same kind.
Therefore, a large space has been needed for
installation of the printers.EP-A-0 615 378 discloses an image printer which includes a projection-exposure
section for projecting and exposing a film image onto a photosensitive material,
an image-exposure section for exposing the photosensitive material and a reader
device for reading the image information of the film image with the image information
being divided into the plurality of areas, the image-exposure section generates
the exposing image information through composition of the plurality of
areas of the image information read by the reader device, image infomation
stored in advance in the image-exposure section, and of further image information
inputted from another input device.But the image printer construction according to this document includes only one
unit of transport passage.Other examples of conventional image printers
are provided in JP-A-02103524 and EP-A-0 251338.The present invention attends to the above-described
problem. And, a primary object of the
present invention is to improve the film-image
exposure processing capacity of the image printer
while restricting increase of its installment space. The present invention attends to the above-described
problem by means of the image printer defined in claim 1. According to this construction,
the photosensitive material transported to the
