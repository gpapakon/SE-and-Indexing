<ABSTRACT>
A currency note picking and feeding apparatus (10) includes feed 
belts (28) for feeding notes from the bottom of a stack of notes (20) to 

the nip of a rotating suction drum (22) and separating belts (64) of 
frictional material which engage with the periphery of the drum (22). 

The suction drum (22) grips and feeds the lowermost note to further 
feeding means (76,82,84), with the separating belts (64) holding back 

any notes superposed on the lowermost note. If a feeding failure of the 
drum (22) occurs, as recognized by photodetector means (90) associated 

with the further feeding means (76,82,84) failing to sense the passage of 
a note within a predetermined time interval, then pivotably mounted 

pressure rolls (92) are caused to be moved temporarily into cooperative 
association with the suction drum (22) so as to press the notes present at 

the nip of the drum (22) and the separating belts (64) against the drum 
(22), thereby increasing the grip of the drum (22) on the lowermost 

note.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet handling apparatus. An apparatus in accordance with the invention could be used, for 
example, as part of an apparatus for loading currency notes into a 
currency cassette. Currency cassettes are used in automated teller machines (ATMs) 
of the kind wherein a user inserts a customer identifying card into the 
machine and then enters certain data (such as a personal identification 
number, quantity of currency required or to be paid in, type of 
transaction, etc.) upon one or more keyboards associated with the 
machine. The machine will then process the transaction, update the 
user's account to reflect the current transaction, dispense cash, when 
requested, extracted from one or more currency cassettes mounted in 
the machine, and return the card to the user as part of a routine 
operation. It is common for an ATM to dispense currency notes of at 
least two different denominations, in which case the ATM will normally 
include a separate currency cassette for notes of each particular 
denomination. The manual loading of currency notes into a cassette can be 
tedious and time-consuming. Accordingly, the need exists for a means 
for facilitating or automating the loading of currency cassettes. From 
GB-A-2198122 there is known an apparatus for automatically loading 
notes into a currency cassette. One embodiment of such apparatus 
includes a carriage which is reciprocally movable between a stacking 
position remote from the cassette and a loading position adjacent an 
open end of the cassette. In operation, a stack of notes is formed on the 
carriage at the stacking position and carried by the carriage to the 
loading position. During a return movement of the carriage to the 
stacking position this stack is laid down into the open end of the 
cassette. It is important for the correct operation of the cash dispensing 
mechanism of an ATM that the currency notes contained in the or each 
currency cassette mounted in the ATM are of a suitable condition for 
handling by the cash dispensing mechanism. For example, if currency 
notes contained in a currency cassette are torn or have foreign matter 
such as adhesive tape or staples attached to them, then there is a risk  
 
that such notes may become jammed in the associated cash dispensing 
mechanism. Thus, care must be taken when loading currency cassettes 
that unsuitable notes should be excluded. If notes are to be loaded into 
a currency cassette from a stack of unscreened notes, it is important 
that, prior to loading, the

Sheet handling apparatus (10) including first feeding means 
(28) for removing sheets from a stack (20), second feeding means (22) 

for receiving sheets fed thereto by said first feeding means, and third 
feeding means (76,82,84) for receiving sheets fed thereto by said second 

feeding means, said second feeding means (22) being associated with 
sheet feed restraining means (64) arranged to inhibit the feeding of two 

or more superposed sheets to said third feeding means, characterized by 
pressure means (92) movable between a home, non-operative position in 

which said pressure means are out of cooperative association with said 
second feeding means (22), and an operative position in which said 

pressure means are in cooperative association with said second feeding 
means, and sensing and control means (75,90) for sensing in operation a 

cessation in the feeding of sheets from said second feeding means (22) 
to said third feeding means (76,82,84) and for causing said pressure 

means (92) to be moved to said operative position in the event of such 
cessation so as to press a sheet engaged by said second feeding means 

(22) against said second feeding means and thereby facilitate the feeding 
of this sheet to said third feeding means (76,82,84). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by a 
rotatable suction drum (22) forming said second feeding means. 
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
periphery of said drum (22) is provided with aperture means (56) and 

associated frictional surface means (58) which together serve to exert a 
grip on a sheet fed to said drum, for onward feeding of this sheet to said 

third feeding means (76,82,84). 
An apparatus according to either claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that said sheet feed restraining means are formed by 

frictional belt means (64) which are in cooperative engagement with, 
and extend partly around, the periphery of said drum (22), said belt 

means being arranged to be stationary during feeding operation of said 
drum. 
An apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that said 
frictional belt means are formed by endless belt means (64), and in that 

there are provided control means (75) for bringing about periodic 
movement of said endless belt means so as to bring different parts of 

said endless belt means into cooperative engagement with the periphery 
of said drum (22).  

 
An apparatus according to either claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterized in that said pressure means (92) are arranged to be 

brought into cooperative association with said drum (22) at a location 
upstream of the area of engagement between said frictional belt means 

(64) and said drum. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that said pressure means are formed by roll means (92) 

which are arranged to be in cooperative association with the periphery 
of said drum means (22) when in their operative position.
