<ABSTRACT>
A packing machine (10) for vacuum packing elongated products (12) such as french fries into a succession of sealed bags (14). The packing machine (10) includes a weigh station (28) for dropping pre-weighed product through vertical column (16) into a bag (14A) at a fill station (18). A divider vane (20) subdivides the vertical column into a pair of passages, whereby the products (12) falling through the passages are aligned as they fall into the bag (14A). The bag is transferred to a vibratory settling station (22). A vacuum is drawn within the bag and a seal jaw assembly (24) then seals the top of the filled bag and the bottom of the next bag, then severs the bag film material (30). A stream-out chute (60) and distribution funnel (62) is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an
improved packaging machine and method for packaging
elongated products particularly such as french
fries.Automated packaging machines and systems are
generally known in the art for filling cartons and
bags and the like with produces. For example, in the
foods industry, it is well-known to process a
particular food item in bulk quantities and then to
convey the processed item to appropriate packaging
equipment for automated package filling. It is
highly desirable, of course, to maximize the quantity
of the product contained in each individual package,
or, alternately stated, it is desirable to minimize
the size of the package per unit weight so that
package costs can be minimized while achieving
maximum use of shipping and/or warehousing space.
With some items, however, such as parfried and frozen
french fry potato strips, the elongated product
configuration has typically resulted in product 
packaging in a random or jackstrawed orientation
which does not maximize the package bulk density. As
a result, substantial product breakage often occurs
as multiple product packages are handled for
placement within a larger shipping case. Moreover,
product settling tends to occur during shipment
and/or storage, often resulting in collapsing of
stacked or palletized shipping cases and further
product breakage. Such product breakage has a strong
negative impact on product quality. In addition, the
inability to maximize product bulk density inherently
increases product shipping cost and related cost of
the product to the ultimate consumer.In the past, a variety of packaging systems
and processes have been proposed particularly for use
with parfried frozen french fries in an effort to
increase the product bulk density within each
package. In this regard, various vibratory and/or
gravity free-fall systems have been suggested in
attempts to align french fry strips within cardboard
or paperboard boxes which are sized for group
placement in turn within conventional corrugated
shipping cases. See, for example, U.S. Patent
4,351,141. Alternately, related packaging systems
have been developed in efforts to align french fries
for delivery into a succession of sealed bags formed
from a suitable kraft-based paper or plastic
packaging material. See, for example, U.S. Patents
4,514,959; 4,586,313; 4,843,795; and in particular US-A-4,607,478
on which the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 is based.While the various french fry alignment
packaging systems of the type referenced above may
provide
