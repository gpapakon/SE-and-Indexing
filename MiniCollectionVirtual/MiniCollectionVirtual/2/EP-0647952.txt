<ABSTRACT>
A thin flexible laminate for overlay application on 
the pins (51) of a connector (52) or other circuit 

element comprises an electrically insulating substrate 
(21), a conductive lamina (31) of apertured pin-receiving 

pads (32), a separate ground strip (33) 
adjacent the pads (32), and an electrically insulating 

cover lamina (41). The substrate (21) and cover (41) 
have apertures (22 and 42) aligned with the pad 

apertures (36). The cover (41) has second apertures 
(43) exposing adjacent edges (38 and 39) of said pads 

(32) and ground strip (33). An electrical overstress 
pulse responsive composite material (62) is positioned 

in the second apertures (43) and bridges the pads (32) 

and the ground strip (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
protection of electrical and electronic circuits from 
high energy electrical overstress pulses that might be 
injurious or destructive to the circuits, and render 
them non-functional, either permanently or temporarily. 
Suitable non-linear compositions and composite 
formulations of materials are known which can be 
connected to, or incorporated as part of an electrical 
circuit, and are characterized by high electrical 
resistance when exposed to low or normal operating 
voltages, but essentially instantaneously switch to low 
electrical resistance in response to an excessive or 
overstress voltage pulse, thereby shunting the 
excessive voltage or overstress pulse to ground. The 
present invention relates particularly to structural 
arrangements for the inclusion of those non-linear 
materials into electrical circuits, and more 
specifically into electrical connectors. The materials utilized in practicing the 
present invention are designed to respond substantially 
instantaneously to the leading edge of an overstress 
voltage pulse by changing their electrical 
characteristics, and by shunting the pulse to ground, 
to reduce the transmitted voltage of the pulse to a 
much lower value, and to clamp the voltage at that  
 
lower value for the duration of the pulse. These 
materials are also capable of substantially 
instantaneous recovery to their original high 
resistance value on termination of the overstress 
pulse, and of repeated responses to repetitive 
overstress pulses. For example, these materials can be 
designed to provide an ohmic resistance in the megohm 
range in the presence of low applied voltages in the 
range of 10 to more than 100 volts. However, upon the 
application of a sudden overstress pulse of, for 
example, 4,000 volts, these materials essentially 
instantaneously drop in resistance and switch to a low 
impedance shunt state that reduces the overstress pulse 
to a value in the range of a few hundred volts, or 
less, and clamps the voltage at that low value for the 
duration of the pulse. In the present description, the 
high resistance state is called the "off-state", and 
the low resistance condition under overstress is called 
the "on-state". Overstress responsive compositions are known 
in the art, and in general, they constitute a mixture 
or composite of finely divided electrically conductive 
and semiconductive particles supported in fixed spaced 
relation to each other in an electrically insulative 
resin binder or matrix. The most
