<ABSTRACT>
An end plug (25) is inserted into the end of a nuclear 
fuel pin cladding tube (4) after loading mixed oxide fuel 

pellets (1) into the tube from a containment area. During 
the pellet loading operation, a disposable sleeve (12) and 

an end plug carrier (24) protect the external surfaces of 
the cladding tube (4) and the end plug (25) from 

contamination. The sleeve (12), mounted on the end of the 
cladding tube (4), is inserted into a seal (13) arranged in 

a wall of the containment area. The end plug (25), located 
within a recess (35, 36) in the plug carrier (24), is then 

inserted into the end of the cladding tube (4) by sliding 
the carrier through the sleeve (12). Upon removal of the 

cladding tube (4), the sleeve (12) and the carrier (24) are 
retained in the seal (13) for ejection into the containment 

area during the next pellet loading operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to loading nuclear fuel pellets 
into a cladding tube to form a nuclear fuel pin for use in a 
nuclear reactor. In particular, the invention is concerned with inserting 
an end plug into the cladding tube after loading a stack of 
fuel pellets into the cladding tube where the pellets are 
made of a mixed oxide fuel comprising a mixture of uranium 
dioxide and plutonium dioxide. Because of the radiological hazards involved in handling 
fuel pellets containing plutonium they are manufactured in a 
containment area enclosed by alpha radiation shielding. 
When loading the pellets from the containment area into a 
cladding tube located outside the containment area, the end 
of the tube through which the pellets are inserted protrudes 
into the containment area. As a result, the end portion of 
the tube becomes radioactively contaminated. This 
necessitates subjecting the pin to a decontamination 
process, which is undesirable since it increases 
manufacturing costs. It is an object of this invention to obviate the need 
for decontamination of the pin following the fuel pellet 
loading operation. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided apparatus for inserting an end plug into a fuel pin 
cladding tube after loading nuclear fuel pellets into said 
cladding tube, said apparatus comprising a sleeve removably 
mounted on one end of the cladding tube, said sleeve being 
slidably locatable in a resilient seal, a carrier having a 
closed recess for locating therein an end plug for closing 
said one end of the cladding tube, the carrier being 
slidable in the sleeve so that on moving the carrier through 
the sleeve the end plug is inserted into said one end of the 
cladding tube, and stop means positioned so as to retain the 
sleeve and the carrier in the resilient seal upon withdrawal 
of the cladding tube.  
 Preferably, the sleeve has an internal seating surface 
comprising a reduced diameter portion extending from one end 
of the sleeve, the seating surface being adapted to fit on 
the end of the cladding tube. The seating surface preferably extends from the said one 
end of the sleeve to an internal end surface which is 
coincident with an end surface of the cladding tube. The seating surface may be a press fit on the cladding 
tube. In a preferred embodiment the end plug has a head 
portion having an end surface and a peripheral surface, the 
depth of the recess in the carrier being sufficient to 
surround the end surface and the peripheral surface. The resilient seal
