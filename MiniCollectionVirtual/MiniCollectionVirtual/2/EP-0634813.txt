<ABSTRACT>
In the case of this distribution block having a plurality of conductor connections (2) which are arranged side by side and contain busbar pieces (4), the mutually facing sides of adjacent busbar pieces (4) are provided with plug contact elements (5) which can be plugged into one another in order to make direct contact, for transverse distribution of the electrical power, so that the transverse connector components, such as transverse distribution rails, space sleeves and the like, which have been normal until now are dispensed with.

<CLAIMS>
A distributor strip having a plurality of conductor connections
(2) which can be arranged in a row in side-by-side relationship and which

include current bar portions (4) and which have plug contact elements (5)
each including a plug tongue (27) and a socket contact (26), wherein the

respective plug tongue (27) engages into the socket contact (26) of an
adjacent current bar portion (4) for the cross-distribution of electrical

power, characterised in that

a first part (21) of each current bar portion (4) has two
respective mutually oppositely disposed spring contact legs (23, 24)

which are centrally connected together in a U-shape by way of a
connecting plate (25) and which at one side of the connecting plate (25)

at the free ends thereof form the socket contact (26),
a second part of each current bar portion (4), at the side of the
connecting plate (25) opposite to the socket contact (26), forms a

connection plane for the insertion of a conductor into the conductor
connection (2), and
the connection plane, the connecting plate (25) and the socket
contact (26) are arranged perpendicularly to the direction in which the

conductor connections (2) are arranged in a row in a spatial row one
above the other.
A distributor strip according to claim 1 characterised in that
the direction of insertion of the conductors (3) into the conductor

connections (2) and the insertion spaces of the socket contacts (26) are
disposed substantially in a plane perpendicularly to the direction in

which the conductor connections (2) are arranged in a row.
A distributor strip according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the plug tongue (27) is arranged at the free end of

one of the spring contact legs (24) of a current bar portion (4) parallel
to its end edge, wherein the plug tongue (27) is so cranked in the

direction of the oppositely disposed spring contact leg (23) that its
central plane coincides with the central plane disposed centrally between

the two spring contact legs (23, 24). 
A distributor strip according to claim 3 characterised in that
the spring contact leg (23) not provided with the plug tongue (27) is

cranked in a direction towards the oppositely disposed spring contact leg
(24).
A distributor strip according to claim 1 characterised in that
arranged on the current bar portions (4) of the conductor connections (2)

are clamping springs (14) for fixing the conductors (3) to the current
bar portions (4).
A distributor strip according to at least one of the preceding
claims characterised in that an additional contact surface (43) is

arranged for the feed into the distributor strip (1) at the socket
contact (26) of a current bar portion (4).
A distributor strip according to claim 6 characterised in that
the contact surface (43) engages into the socket contact (26).
A distributor strip according to claim 6 characterised in that
the contact surface is in the form of a U-shaped fork contact (40) which

embraces the socket contact (26).
A distributor strip according to claim 6 characterised in that
the contact surface is in the form of a contact tongue electrically

connected to one of the outside surfaces, which face away from each
other, of the spring contact legs (23, 24).
A distributor strip according to at least one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the distributor strips are arranged in a

main housing (51) of an initiator terminal block fixed on a mounting rail
(54).
A distributor strip according to claim 10 characterised in that a
current bar portion (4) of the distributor strip (1) is electrically

connected to the mounting rail (54) of the initiator terminal block. 
A distributor strip according to claim 11 characterised in that

for electrical connection to the mounting rail (54) a contact bow (58)
engages into the socket contact (26) of a current bar portion (4) of the

distributor strip (1).
A distributor strip according to claim 10 characterised in that
provided in the main housing (51) are push-in fixings (80, 81) for

releasably connecting the distributor strip (1) and the main housing
(51).
