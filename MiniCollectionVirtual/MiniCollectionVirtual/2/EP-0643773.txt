<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a modified tubulin comprising a tubulin polypeptide which confers resistance to an anti-tubulin agent when expressed within a biological organism, said polypeptide having at least one amino acid substitution such that hydrophobicity is increased at one or more positions in the polypeptide. DNA sequences encoding such modified tubulins may be used to confer resistance on organisms which otherwise would be susceptible to one or more anti-tubulin agents. For example, a plant which is resistant to a herbicide that disrupts microtubule structure or function may be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HERBICIDE RESISTANT PLANTSThis invention relates to modified tubulins, DNA sequences encoding such tubulins and organisms transformed with such DNA.Almost all eukaryotic cells contain microtubules which comprise a major component of the network of proteinaceous filaments known as the cytoskeleton. Microtubules thereby participate in the control of cell shape and intracellular transport. They are also the principal constituent of mitotic and meiotic spindles, cilia and flagella. In plants, microtubules have additional specialized roles in cell division and cell expansion during development.In terms of their composition, microtubules are proteinaceous hollow rods with a diameter of approximately 24nm and highly variable length. They are assembled from heterodimer subunits of an α-tubulin and a β-tubulin polypeptide, each with a molecular weight of approximately 50,000. Both polypeptides are highly flexible globular proteins (approximately 445 amino acids), each with a predicted 25% α helical and 40% β-pleated sheet content, in addition to the two major forms (α- and β-tubulin), there is a rare γ-tubulin form which does not appear to participate directly in the formation of microtubule structure, but rather it may function in the initiation of microtubule structure.In all organisms, the multiple α- and β-tubulin polypeptides are encoded by corresponding families of α- and β-tubulin genes, which are 

located in the nuclear genome. Many such genes (or corresponding cDNAs) have been isolated and sequenced. For example, maize has approximately 6 α-tubulin genes and approximately 8 β-tubulin genes dispersed over the genome (Villemur et al, 1992, 34th Maize Genetics Symposium) . Some of the α-tubulin genes from maize have been cloned and sequenced (Montoliu et al, 1989, Plant Mol Biol, 14, 1-15; Montoliu et al, 1990, Gene, 94, 201-207; Villemur et al, 1992, J Mol Biol, 227:81-96), as have some of the β-tubulin genes (Hussey et al, 1990, Plant Mol Biol, 15, 957-972). Comparison of amino acid sequences of the three documented maize α-tubulins indicates they have 93% homology. Maize β-tubulins exhibit 38% identity with these α-tubulins. In segments of divergence between the α- and β-tubulin amino acid sequences, homology ranges from 13% to 17%. Homology between the three α-tubulin amino acid sequences within these same α-/β-divergence regions ranges from 77% to 96%.Sequence information on the various tubulin forms shows that throughout evolution the protein domains involved in polymerization have been highly
