Charge-melting furnace having a side wall comprising 
at least one window in which there is disposed an 

oxygenated gas injector comprising an end part defining an 
outlet passage which is not orthogonal to the wall of the 

furnace, characterized in that the injector comprises an 
assembly made up of an elongated body (16) having one main 

direction and defining a gas inlet passage which is 
connectable to a pipe system for feeding oxygenated gas, 

and of a head (14) defining the gas outlet passage (11) 
constituting a prolongation of the inlet passage while 

forming a predetermined angle (Î±) with the latter, the head 
(14) and the window (20) being dimensioned so that the head 

is substantially arranged entirely in the thickness of the 
wall (1). 
Furnace according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the head (14) has an end face (24) which is substantially 

orthogonal to the main direction. 
Furnace according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that it comprises means (19) for supporting the injector in 

rotation that cooperate with the body (16). 
Furnace according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 

that the end face (24) is substantially coplanar with the 
internal face (1") of the wall (1). 
Furnace according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the surface of the inlet and outlet 

passages of the injector (7-9) is polished. 
Furnace according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises means (22, 23) for 

cooling the head (14) of the injector (7-9).  
 
Furnace according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the cooling means comprise a refrigerating fluid circuit 

(22, 23) which is at least partially embedded in the 
injector. 
Furnace according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the head (14) and the body (16) of 

the injector are made in one piece. 
Furnace according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it comprises at least two injectors 

(7-9) which are spaced apart angularly and are oriented so 
as to blow jets of oxygenated gas in substantially 

tangential directions in the furnace.
