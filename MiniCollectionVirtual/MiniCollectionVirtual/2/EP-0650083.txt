<ABSTRACT>
A package that protects an optical fiber from strain or controls the strain 
to which the fiber is subjected for a desired effect and a method for making the 

package are disclosed. The package is a sleeve with an internal passage in which a 
port
ion of an optical fiber is placed. The optical fiber and the sleeve are made of 
materials with coefficients of thermal expansion that are the same or different. 
If the coefficients of thermal expansion are the same, the package 
protects the fiber from certain strains brought about by a change in temperature that 

would otherwise result if the package and the fiber were made of different materials. 
However, by selectively mismatching the coefficients of thermal expansion of the 

package and the fiber, a change in temperature can be used to bring about a desired 
change in the wavelength of a grating written in the fiber. The optical fiber is fixed 

in the sleeve by epoxy or other adhesive means at least at one point in the internal 
passage of the sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a package for an optical fiber that controls 
the amount of strain to which the fiber is subjected. Gratings that are written into optical fibers perform a variety of 
functions. For example, two gratings are written in proximity to each other in an 
optical fiber doped with a rare earth metal. Rare-earth-doped fibers have been used 
as a gain medium in a single-frequency linear cavity fiber laser. Such a laser is 
described in Ball, G. A., et al., "Design of a Single-Mode Linear-Cavity Erbium 
Fiber Laser Utilizing Bragg Reflectors," JournalofLightwaveTechnology, 10(10): 
1338 (October 1992). Gratings are periodic, permanent refractive index 
perturbations. A grating written in a fiber reflects light of a particular wavelength or 
band of wavelengths. Other wavelengths of light are transmitted through the grating. The wavelength or wavelength band of light that is reflected by the 
grating is referred to as the grating wavelength. The grating itself is a plurality of 
grating elements that are written into an optical fiber using techniques such as those 
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,042,897 to Meltz et al. Gratings, however, are 
precision components. To maintain this precision, the grating itself must not be 
distorted. This is because the operation of the grating depends upon the orientation 
and the spacing of the individual grating elements relative to one another. If the 
grating is distorted, the relationship between the various grating elements may be 
changed with a concomitant change in the wavelengths of light that are transmitted 
and reflected by the grating. As discussed in Meltz, G., et al., "Bragg Grating 
Formation and Germanosilicate Fiber Photosensitivity", SPIE, 1516: 185-199 (May 
1991), gratings written into optical fibers are subject to distortion if the fibers are 
subjected to strain in the vicinity of the grating. Gratings written into an optical fiber can function as feedback elements 
for a fiber optic laser. Typically, two gratings are written into an optical fiber to 
provide the feedback. Each grating is a wavelength-selective reflector having a 
reflectance response curve with at least one well-defined peak. The precise 
wavelength of operation of the laser is determined, at least in part, by the 
relationship between the modal structure of the cavity and the reflectance curve of 
the gratings. That is, for the laser to exhibit gain at a given wavelength (under 
appropriate stimulation), the given wavelength must fall within a reflectance
