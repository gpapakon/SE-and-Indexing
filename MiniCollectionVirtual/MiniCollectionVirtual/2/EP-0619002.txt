<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an improved 
device for connecting blades to a hub in propellers of 
fans, aircraft and other applications. In the application for European patent No. 
90810598.4 of the same applicant, an application that was 
published on February 20, 1991 with No. 0 413 663 A2 with 
Argentine priority of August 14, 1989, a device is claimed in 
which the connection of each blade to the hub took place by 
means of a screw placed outside the contour of the blade. Said screw acted as a pivot for the variation of 
the fitting of each blade, by ensuring the mechanical 
blocking of the blade itself to the hub, at the desired 
fitting. In the Italian patent application in the name of 
Elica s.r.l. No. 91A 003500, filed on December 30, 1991, 
there is a blade-hub connection that falls within the above-mentioned 
previous European patent application of the 
application, inasmuch as the attachment of the blades to the 
hub, although realized in a different manner, has the 
longitudinal axis of the screw located outside the contour of 
each blade (see for example figures 13 and 14 of that patent 
application). Both in the device according to the EPO Ceute 
patent application, and in the Elica s.r.l. Italian patent 
application just cited, the blade was practically not 
disturbed structurally at the base by maintaining the full 
resisting section in the areas of maximum bending moment. The disadvantage of the "Ceute" device was that it 
had to have hubs large in diameter since each blade, for at 
least 50% of the span had to be superimposed on the hub. This did not constitute a drawback for fans of 
large diameter, made up of blades characterized by significant  
 
slenderness (by slenderness is meant the ratio: radius 
of the blade/span of the blade): the large diameter hub 
serves to reduce the length of the blade and thus the 
stresses, and to create a shield to prevent the reverse flow 
in the area of the hub. Obviously this effect can be obtained in much less 
costly way by means of a simple sheet metal, aluminum or 
plastic disc. On the other hand, with small diameter fans, the 
"Ceute" device would compromise the performance of the fan, 
since it necessitated a hub of excessive diameter with the 
resulting necessity of fairing upstream from the hub. The "Elica" device, in practice, although it 
reduces costs with respect to the solution just examined 
inasmuch as the cost of the hub decreases significantly, 
presents the drawback, for small fans, of exhibiting the 
bases of the blades that

<CLAIMS>
Device for connecting blades (7) to a hub (5) in propellers 
of fans, aircraft and other applications, in which 

an attachment of one blade (7) to the hub (5) is effected 
such that their longitudinal axes intersect at 

right angles, the attachment comprises an L-shaped element 
(1), one side of the element (1) is substantially 

aligned with the longitudinal blade axis, the other side 
of the element (1) is provided with a hole (3) for the 

passage of a screw (4) fastening the element (1) to the 
hub (5), the longitudinal axis of the hole (3) is parallel 

and eccentric with respect to the longitudinal axis 
of the blade (7), 
characterized in that
 the other side 
of the element (1) facing the surface of the hub (5) is 

provided with a circular crown (6) for equal tightening 
of the screw (4), the hole (4) is displaced from the 

centre of the circular crown (6) about a second eccentricity 
(e) in a direction where the circular crown (6) 

has the greatest tendency to work loose from the surface 
of the hub (5) by the effect of aerodynamic stresses. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein said eccentricity 
(e) with respect to the axis of the circular crown (6) 

is greater than 15% of the exterior diameter of crown 
(6). 
Device according to claim 1, wherein said L-shaped element 
(1) comprises a conical part (9) to be connected 

to a notch (10) in the hub (5), while the axis of the 
screw (4) and of the circular crown (6) are coincident. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein said L-shaped element 
(1) comprises a conical notch (12) to be connected 

to a matching conical protruding part (11) on the hub 
(5), while the axis of the screw (4) and of the circular 

crown (6) are coincident.
