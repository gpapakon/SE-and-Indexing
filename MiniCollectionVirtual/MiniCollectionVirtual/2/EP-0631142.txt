<ABSTRACT>
In an acceleration detector for detecting three-dimensional 
components of acceleration applied thereto independently 

with respect to three axes X, Y and Z of an orthogonal 
coordinate system, a plurality of piezo resistance elements 

(RX1-RX4, RY1-RY4, RZ1-RZ4) are formed in a thin-sheet resilient 
member (30) with an unique arrangement thereof for improving 

the sensitivity of the detector. Electric resistance 
of the resistance elements is varied in response to strain of 

the resistance elements accompanied with an elastic deformation 
of the resilient member. The resilient member (30) is 

fixed at its periphery on a frame (10) of the detector (1). A 
weight is connected with a center portion (31) of the resilient 

member such that the elastic deformation is caused when 
the weight is displaced by receiving acceleration. All of the 

resistance elements for detecting the components of acceleration 
with respect to the X- and Y-axes are limited within an 

inner area adjacent to a circumference of the center portion 
(31). The inner area is capable of causing a larger elastic 

deformation than the outer area adjacent the frame (10) when 
the weight is displaced by acceleration. Therefore, an improved 

sensitivity of the detector is accomplished by the arrangement 
of the resistance elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration detector 
which adopts an unique arrangement of resistance elements 
having a piezo resistance effect for improving the sensitivity 
thereof. As an acceleration detector for detecting acceleration 
applied thereto, diaphragm- and beam-type acceleration 
detectors have been already known. For example, as shown in 
FIGS. 21 and 22, a diaphragm-type acceleration detector 1C 
comprises a frame 10C defining an open space therein and 
having a top face 11C and bottom face 12C, a bottom cover 20C, 
a thin-sheet resilient member 30C, and a weight 40C. The 
resilient member 30C is jointed at its periphery to the top 
face 11C of the frame 10C. The weight 40C is hung down from a 
center of the resilient member 30C through a neck portion 41C. 
The neck portion 41C is fixed with a center portion 31C of the 
resilient member 30C in such a manner as to cause an elastic 
deformation of the resilient member when the weight 40C is 
displaced with respect to the frame 10C by receiving an 
acceleration. These parts of the acceleration detector 1C are 
made of a semi-conductor material. Resistance elements R 
having a piezo resistance effect are formed in the resilient 
member 30C to detect three components of acceleration applied  
 
to the detector 1C with respect to X-, Y- and Z- axes of an 
orthogonal coordinate system in such a manner that electric 
resistance of the resistance elements R is varied in response 
to strain of the resistance elements accompanied with the 
elastic deformation of the resilient member. The acceleration 
is determined in accordance with a variation of the electric 
resistance by an acceleration determining section. The bottom 
cover 20C is useful as a stopper for preventing a breakage of 
the resilient member 30C when receiving an excess 
acceleration. Numeral "62" designates a bonding pad for 
wiring a conductor pattern. U.S. Patent Application No. 4,967,605 discloses an 
arrangement of resistance elements R for a diaphragm-type 
acceleration detector, as shown in FIG. 24. The resistance 
elements R consisting of a first set of four resistance 
elements RX1-RX4 for detecting a first component of 
acceleration with respect to the X-axis, a second set of four 
resistance elements RY1-RY4 for detecting a second component 
of acceleration with respect to the Y-axis, and a third set of 
four resistance elements RZ1-RZ4 for detecting a third 
component of acceleration with respect to the Z-axis. When X- and 
Y-axes are set on a plane of a
