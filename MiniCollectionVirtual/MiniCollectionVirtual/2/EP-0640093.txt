<ABSTRACT>
The sequences encoding two isoforms of human cellular retinoic acid binding proteins, CRABP-I and CRABP-II, have been cloned and sequenced and are set forth with their corresponding amino acid sequences in SEQ ID NOS. 1-4. The indentification of human CRABP nucleic and amino acid sequences provides the basis for the construction of recombinant human CRABP vectors and expression constructs. Human CRABP can also be synthesized or produced ex vivo, e.g. in bacterial or other production systems. Ligand binding assays, including recombinant and chimeric receptor reporter assays, and direct and competition hybridization assays employing the human CRABP sequences herein described can be used to test drugs for retinoic induction and tissue specificity for pathologies in which retinoids are implicated. Immunoassays utilizing antibodies or binding fragments produced to human CRABP can also be used to test patient tissues for the presence and levels of CRABP for diagnosis and to monitor treatment. The indentification of the nucleic and amino acids sequences for human CRABP-I and CRABP-II also contributes to the elucidation of the function and interaction of the retinoid-binding proteins. The CRABP-II gene, isolated from a human placenta genomic library, spans 6 kilobases and includes 4 exons. One major transcription initiation site was mapped to an A residue 137 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon. CRABP-II mRNA was rapidly induced within 2-6 hours in culture by retinoic acid, primarily due to an increased rate of transcription which required on-going synthesis. The human CRABP-II gene is thus apparently transcriptionally regulated by a newly synthesized regulator protein. Once the CRABP-II is produced, message stabilization may provide means by which elevated CRABP-II in mRNA is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMAN CRABP-I AND CRABP-II FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) and, more specifically, to human CRABP-I and CRABP-II and the sequences encoding them, and their use in various assay systems for screening and diagnostic applications and for therapeutic purposes.RELATED APPUCATIONSThis is a continuation of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/874,847, entitled "HumanCRABP-I and CRABP-II," filed April 28, 1992 by Voorhees et al. which is a continuation-in- part of co-pending U.S. application Serial No. 751,893 entitled "Human CRABP-I andCRABP-II", filed August 30, 1991 by Voorhees et al., all herein incorporated by reference.GENBANK ACCESSION INFORMATION GENE ACCESSION NO. human CRABP-II M68867 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRetinoids are essential regulators of epithelial cell growth and cellular differentiation, skin being a major target in both normal and pathological states. Sporn, M.B. et al., Cancer Res. 43:3034-3040 (1983); Kopan, R. et al., J. Cell Biol. 109:295-307 (1989); Asselineau, D. et al., Dev. Biol. 133:322-335 (1989); and Lippman, S.M. et al., Pharmacol. Ther. 40:107-122 (1989). It has been shown that retinoids prevent cancer in skin and have efficacy as agents in human malignant and premalignant cutaneous disorders. Asselineau, D. et al., Dev. Biol. 133:322-335 (1989). it has also been shown that retinoids cause growth inhibition in many hyper-proliferating cell lines, a feature that makes the compounds of fundamental interest as anti-tumor and anti-psoriatic agents. Sporn, M.B. et al., Cancer Res. 43:3034-3040 (1983); and Asselineau, D. et al., Dev. Biol. 133:322-335 (1989). Retinoids also play fundamental roles in directing the spatial organization of cells during development and the generation of vertebrate limbs. Eichele, G. Trends Genet. 5:246-251 (1989); and Summerbell, D. et al., Trends Neurosci. 13:142-147 (1990).The elucidation of the function of retinoids in the complex biological processes involved in cell growth and differentiation requires the identification of the specific components of the retinoid signal transduction system as well as the genes directly regulated by this system. Several intracellular retinoid-binding proteins have already been identified, including cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBP), nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP) and, most recently, RXRs, also belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily of genes.
