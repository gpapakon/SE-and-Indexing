<ABSTRACT>
Fuel delivery system for motor vehicle with internal combustion engine, in which an auxiliary pump delivers fuel from the unconfined tank space into an anti-splash chamber, the anti-splash chamber (8) being enclosed by a further anti-splash chamber (15), which is connected to the first chamber by a connection (16) existing in the bottom area of both chambers (8, 15) and at the top is open to the unconfined tank space (10). The said system thereby has functional advantages and is easily fitted.

<CLAIMS>
Fuel delivery system insertable in a fuel tank (1), having 
an anti-roll chamber (8) with a pump aggregate (4) consisting of 

a fore pump and main pump (5, 6), wherein the fore pump (5) pumps 
into the anti-roll chamber and the main pump (6) pumps out, and 

the anti-roll chamber (8) has a dome section (13) communicating 
with the open interior of the tank (14), characterised in that 

the anti-roll chamber (8) is surrounded by a further anti-roll 
chamber (15), which is connected to the first by a connection 

(16) existing in the lower region of both chambers (8, 15) and 
is open at the top with respect to the open interior of the tank 

(10). 
System according to claim 1, characterised in that the fuel 
not required by the internal combustion engine passes via a 

return connection (12) into the first anti-roll chamber (8). 
System according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
connection (16) connecting the two anti-roll chambers (8, 15) in 

the lower region and the connection (14) leading out of the dome 
section (13) into the free interior of the tank (10) have a 

throttle section (17). 
System according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
connection (16) disposed in the lower region has a non-return 

valve (18), which prevents leaking from the first anti-roll 
chamber (8). 
System according to claim 3, characterised in that a bypass 
(19) with a non-return valve (18) is provided to the throttled 

connection (16), so that leaking from the first anti-roll chamber 
(8) is prevented. 
System according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
connection (16) provided in the lower region forms the inlet of 

an injection pump (21), whose injection nozzle (22) is formed by  
 

the return connection (12) and injects the recycled fuel into the 
inlet (20). 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least between the main stage (6) of the 

pump aggregate (4) and the induction and compression nozzles (23, 
24) of the fore pump (5) and anti-roll chamber walls (21) 

resilient bracing members (26) are mounted. 
System according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the first anti-roll chamber (8) has a 

smaller volume than the second anti-roll chamber (15).
