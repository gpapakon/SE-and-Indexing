<ABSTRACT>
A length mode drop on demand type ink jet print head includes a lower body portion formed of an active piezoelectric material and an upper body formed from an inactive material. The lower body portion, which includes a plurality of longitudinally extending projections, is poled in a first direction generally orthogonal to both its longitudinal and vertical axes. The upper body portion also includes a plurality of longitudinally extending projections. The lower and upper body portions are mated such that the lower and upper body projections are spaced interdigitally with each other. By mating the lower and upper body portions in this manner, a plurality of ink-carrying channels are formed. The ink jet print head further includes a controller for selectively applying an electric field across each of the lower body projections in the poling direction. When an electric field is applied across one of the lower body projections in this fashion, the projection imparts a pressure pulse to the ink-carrying channel associated therewith. The active lower body portion may be replaced with an inactive lower body portion, an active intermediate body portion which includes a plurality of longitudinally extending projections, each having a strip of conductive material along the top surface thereof, and a layer of conductive material mounting the lower and intermediate body portions together. Here, the intermediate body portion would be poled in its vertical axis and the electric field would be applied between the conductive strip and layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to ink jet printing techniques 
and, more particularly, to a length mode, large array, 
high density, drop on demand type ink jet print head for 
use in ink jet printing applications. Printers provide a means of outputting a permanent 
record in human readable form. Typically, a printing 
technique may be categorized as either impact printing or 
non-impact printing. In impact printing, an image is 
formed by striking an inked ribbon placed near the 
surface of the paper. Impact printing techniques may be 
further characterized as either formed-character printing 
or matrix printing. In formed-character printing, the 
element which strikes the ribbon to produce the image 
consists of a raised mirror image of the desired 
character. In matrix printing, the character is formed  
 
as a series of closely spaced dots which are produced by 
striking a provided wire or wires against the ribbon. 
Here, characters are formed as a series of closely spaced 
dots produced by striking the provided wire or wires 
against the ribbon. By selectively striking the provided 
wires, any character representable by a matrix of dots 
can be produced. Non-impact printing is often preferred over impact 
printing in view of its tendency to provide higher 
printing speeds as well as its better suitability for 
printing graphics and half-tone images. Non-impact 
printing techniques include matrix, electrostatic and 
electrophotographic type printing techniques. In matrix 
type printing, wires are selectively heated by electrical 
pulses and the heat thereby generated causes a mark to 
appear on a sheet of paper, usually specially treated 
paper. In electrostatic type printing, an electric arc 
between the printing element and the conductive paper 
removes an opaque coating on the paper to expose a 
sublayer of a contrasting color. Finally, in 
electrophotographic printing, a photoconductive material 
is selectively charged utilizing a light source such as 
a laser. A powder toner is attracted to the charged 
regions and, when placed in contact with a sheet of 
paper, transfers to the paper's surface. The toner is 
then subjected to heat which fuses it to the paper. Another form of non-impact printing is generally 
classified as ink jet printing. Ink jet printing systems 
use the ejection of tiny droplets of ink to produce an 
image. The devices produce highly reproducible and 
controllable droplets so that a droplet may be printed at  
 
a location specified by digitally stored image data.
