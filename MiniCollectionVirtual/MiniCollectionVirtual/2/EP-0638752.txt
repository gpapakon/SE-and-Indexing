<ABSTRACT>
A pipe connector capable of tightly coupling pipes at 
opposite ends thereof. The pipe connector includes a nipple (100) 

including a first pipe member (30) and a second pipe member (40) adapted 
to receive one end of a pipe (110) to be coupled to the nipple (100), a 

clamp member (120) adapted to be threadedly coupled to the second 
pipe member (40), an inner pipe portion (40b) formed radially inwardly of 

the second pipe member (40) to extend in a longitudinal direction 
of the second pipe member (40), an annular space defined between 

the second pipe member (40) and the inner pipe portion and adapted 
to receive the one end of the pipe (110), a spacer (40d) extending from 

an outer end of the second pipe member (40) in a longitudinal 
direction of the second pipe member (40), the spacer (40d) being adapted 

to be pressed against an outer surface of the pipe (110) toward a 
center line of the pipe by the inclined surface (120c) of the clamp 

member (120) when the clamp member (120) is fastened under a condition 
that the one end of the pipe (110) has been received in the annular 

space, whereby the pipe is partially depressed by the spacer (40d), 
and an annular groove (40c) formed on an outer surface of the inner 

pipe portion and adapted to receive the depressed portion of 
the pipe (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe connector, and 
more particularly to a pipe connector capable of tightly 
coupling pipes at opposite ends thereof. Conventionally, there have been known a variety of pipe 
connectors. An example of such conventional pipe connectors 
is illustrated in FIGS. 1A to 2B. The pipe connector shown in 
FIGS. 1A to 2B comprises a nipple 1 having a first pipe member 
3 formed with a threaded portion 3a on the outer surface 
thereof and a second pipe member 4 formed with a threaded 
portion 4a on the outer surface thereof. The first and second 
pipe members 3 and 4 are integral with each other and adapted 
to fit pipes therein, respectively. Between the first and 
second pipe members 3 and 4, a hexagonal surface 6 is formed 
which is adapted to be engaged with a pipe wrench or a spanner 
upon coupling pipes. The second pipe member 4 has at inner 
end thereof a flange 4b formed on the inner surface of the 
second pipe member 4. When a pipe is fitted in the second 
pipe member 4, the end of the pipe received in the second pipe  
 
member 4 comes into contact with the flange 4b. As shown in 
FIGS. 2A and 2B, an inclined surface 4c having a truncated 
cone shape is provided at the inner surface of the second pipe 
member 4. The inclined surface 4c is positioned at the outer 
end of the second pipe member 4. The pipe connector further 
comprises a press ring 15 having an annular groove 15a formed 
at the central portion of the press ring 15. On both sides of 
the annular groove 15, the press ring 15 has a pair of taper 
portions 15b and 15c each having an inclined surface. The 
pipe connector further comprises a clamp member 20 threadedly 
coupled to the nipple 1 . The clamp member 20 has a hexagonal 
surface 20a formed on the outer surface of the clamp member 20 
and adapted to be engaged with a pipe wrench or a spanner upon 
coupling pipes. The clamp member 20 also has at inner surface 
thereof a threaded portion 20b adapted to be threadedly 
engaged with the threaded portion 4a of the second pipe member 
4, as shown in FIG. 2B. The clamp member 20 further includes 
an inclined surface 20c and a through hole 22 which are 
formed inwardly of the inner end of the threaded portion 20b. 
Where a pipe 10 is fitted in the second pipe member 4 of the 
nipple 1 through the through hole 22 of clamp member 20, 
the inclined surface 20c of the clamp member 20 comes into 
contact with the taper portion 15b of the press ring 15 and 
presses the taper portion 15b against the outer surface of
