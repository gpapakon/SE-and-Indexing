<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a purification process for purifying
exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine.The present applicant has already proposed an
internal combustion engine in which a lean air-fuel
mixture is burned, in which internal combustion engine an
NOx absorbent which absorbs the NOx when the air-fuel
ratio of an inflowing exhaust gas is lean and releases
the absorbed NOx when the oxygen concentration in the
inflowing exhaust gas is lowered is arranged in an engine
exhaust passage; the NOx generated when the lean air-fuel
mixture is burned is absorbed by the NOx absorbent before
the NOx absorption capability of the NOx absorbent is
saturated, the air-fuel ratio of the inflowing exhaust
gas to the NOx absorbent is temporarily made rich so that
the NOx absorbent is made to release the NOx and, at the
same time, the released NOx is reduced
EP-A-0.560.991 published 22.09.93.However, the fuel and the lubrication oil of the
engine contain sulfur, and therefore SOx is contained in
the exhaust gas. Accordingly, in this internal combustion
engine, this SOx is also absorbed into the NOx absorbent
together with the NOx. However, this SOx is not released
from the NOx absorbent even if the air-fuel ratio of the
inflowing exhaust gas to the NOx absorbent is made rich,
and accordingly the amount of SOx in the NOx absorbent is
gradually increased. However, when the amount of SOx in
the NOx absorbent is increased, the amount of the NOx
that can be absorbed by the NOx absorbent is gradually
lowered, and finally the NOx absorbent becomes no longer 
able to absorb almost any NOx. Therefore, the present
applicant has already proposed an internal combustion
engine in which a sulfur trap is provided in the engine
exhaust passage at the upstream side of the NOx
absorbent, and the SOx contained in the exhaust gas is
caught by this sulfur trap EP-A-0.582.917, published 16.02.94.
In this internal combustion engine, the
SOx discharged from the engine is caught by the sulfur
trap, and therefore only the NOx is absorbed into the NOx
absorbent.However, in this internal combustion engine, the SOx
caught by the sulfur trap is continuously being caught in
the sulfur trap without being released from the sulfur
trap even if the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas
flowing into the sulfur trap is made rich. Accordingly,
the amount of the SOx caught by the sulfur trap is
gradually increased. When the SOx catching capability of
the sulfur trap is saturated, the SOx passes through the
sulfur trap, and therefore there arises
