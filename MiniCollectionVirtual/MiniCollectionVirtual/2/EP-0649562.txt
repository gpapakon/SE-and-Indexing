<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuit protection devices which comprise two
laminar electrodes and, sandwiched between the electrodes, a laminar resistive
element which exhibits PTC behavior.Such laminar devices can sometimes be used without the addition of electrical
leads, for example by installation between two spring-loaded terminals. DE-A-3839868
(and equivalent U.S. Patent No. 4,924,204) describe such laminar devices in
which the PTC element is composed of a conductive polymer, i.e. a composition
comprising a polymer and, dispersed therein, a particulate conductive filler. The
devices disclosed in DE-A-3839868 are electrically connected to other components of
a circuit through terminal members which elastically engage "non-electrode regions"
of the device, each of the non-electrode regions comprising one only of the two
electrodes and a corresponding portion of the PTC element. In most cases, however,
an electrical lead is secured to each of the laminar electrodes, so that the device can be
connected to other components of a circuit. The addition of leads is an additional
expense and usually involves heating (e.g. during soldering or welding) which can
cause damage, particularly to conductive polymer elements. The latter problem is
particularly severe when a conductive polymer is heated a second time when the leads
are connected to other circuit elements, in particular when the leads are connected to a
printed circuit board by a soldering process. A further problem which can arise when
such devices are to be mounted on a printed circuit board is that they protrude further
from the board than is desirable.In one aspect, the present invention provides circuit protection devices which
have a resistance at 23°C of less than 50 ohms and which comprise
(1) a first laminar electrode (13), (2) a second laminar electrode (15), and(3) a laminar resistive element (61) which is composed of a PTC
conductive polymer, and which has a first face to which the first
electrode is secured and an opposite second face to which the second
electrode is secured; 
the device comprising
(a) a main portion (11, C-D) which comprises
(i) a main part of the first electrode (13),(ii) a main part of the second electrode (15), and(iii) a main part of the resistive element (61); 
   and (b) a first connection leg (19) which extends away from the main portion
and which comprises
(i) a first leg part of the first electrode (13) which is integral with
the main part of the first electrode (13), and (ii) a first leg part of the resistive
