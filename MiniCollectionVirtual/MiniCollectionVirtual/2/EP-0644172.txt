<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing 1-chloro-1,3-butadiene, 
which consists in gas-phase dehydrochlorinating a 

dichlorobutene selected from 3,4-dichloro-1-butene and 
1,4-dichloro-2-butene, in the presence of a catalyst 

selected from lanthanum phosphate and lanthanum 
phosphate doped with an alkali or alkaline-earth 

metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing 1-chloro-1,3-butadiene by means of the 
dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichloro-butene-1 and/or 
1,4-dichloro-2-butene. It is known that 1-chloro-1,3-butadiene, also 
referred to as "alpha-chloroprene", can be polymerized 
or copolymerized, preferably with chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene). Alpha-chloroprene is normally found as a 
byproduct from most reactions leading to 2-chlorobutadiene. 
In fact, small amounts of alpha-chloroprene 
are formed during vinylacetylene 
hydrochlorination. Furthermore, amounts of alpha-chloroprene, 
which may vary as a function of the 
existing reaction conditions, are formed during the 
reactions of butadiene chlorination, or of 1,4-chloro-2-butene 
isomerization to yield 3,4-dichloro-1-butene, 
or, also , of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene 
dehydrochlorination. A high yield in alpha-chloroprene can be obtained 
by dehydrochlorinating 1,4-dichloro-2-butene, obtained 
in its turn by starting from butenediol, with sodium 
amide in mineral oil. Such a process is very 
expensive, because it requires at least stoichiometric 
amounts of sodium amide. The object of the present invention is an 
improved process for producing 1-chloro-1,3-butadiene, 
which overcomes the above drawbacks. In accordance with the above, the present 
invention relates to a process for preparing 1-chloro-1,3-butadiene,  
 
characterized in that a dichlorobutene 
selected from 3,4-dichloro-1-butene, 1,4-dichloro-2-butene 
and their mixtures, is dehydrochlorinated, in 
gas phase, in the presence of a catalyst selected from 
lanthanum phosphate, lanthanum phosphate doped with at 
least one alkali or alkaline-earth metal, and mixtures 
of said phosphates. The catalyst is preferably selected from 
lanthanum phosphate and lanthanum phosphate doped with 
cesium. By "lanthanum phosphate doped with an alkali or 
an alkaline-earth metal", a compound is understood 
herein which is as defined in EP-A-440 555, i.e., a 
compound having the general formula (based on dry 
material): 
LaPO4·(Imp)pIn the compound having the above general formula 
(I), by "Imp", a basic impregnation compound is 
understood, which is constituted by a metal selected 
from alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals, 
preferably alkaline-earth metals, with said metals 
being associated with a counter ion, to such an extent 
as to secure the neutrality of the compound of general 
formula (I). In above formula (I), the coefficient "p" 
is comprised within the range of from 10-2 to 1/3, 
preferably of
