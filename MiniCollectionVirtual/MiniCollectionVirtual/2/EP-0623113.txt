<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides novel N-[2-(cyclic 
alkyl)phenyl]pyrazole-4-carboxamides useful as 
fungicides. Fungicides control various phytopathological 
diseases by interrupting various metabolic pathways 
within the fungal organism. Thus different fungicides 
may control the same disease, but by different modes of 
action. Many organisms, however, can develop resistance 
to a particular mode of action over time. Thus, having 
available fungicides which act by various modes of 
action is important to adequately control most diseases. One mode of action is the inhibition of the 
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme in the respiratory 
pathway of fungi. This mode of action has previously 
been demonstrated for control of basidiomycetes. For 
example, carboxin is a commercially available fungicide 
which exhibits this mode of action against various 
basidiomycetes. Drouhot et al. ["Properties of Botrytis 
cinerea Mitochondria and Effects of Various Toxicants 
Including Fungicides," Pesticide Science, 30:415-417, 
1991] have suggested that such a mode of action for 
control of ascomycetes, such as Botrytis sp., is needed 
to overcome resistance problems. In their tests of 
respiratory inhibition, carboxin exhibited a 68% inhibition 
at 1 ÂµM concentration and was judged the best 
fungicide of those tested for SDH mode of action against 
Botrytis.Pyrazolecarboxamide fungicides are known in the 
art. U.S. Patent Number 4,134,987 (Huppatz, January 16,  
 
1979) discloses various N-(phenyl)pyrazolecarboxamides. 
U.S. Patent Number 4,742,074, issued May 3, 1988, to 
Nishida et al., discloses various N-(substituted-indanyl)pyrazole-4-carboxamides 
useful as fungicides for 
various agronomic diseases. It is an object of this invention to provide 
compounds having a high level of activity in SDH 
inhibition in ascomycetes. It is a further object of 
this invention to provide compounds having a broad 
spectrum of activity against fungal diseases of plants. 
It is a further object of this invention to provide 
methods of controlling or preventing fungal diseases of 
plants. It is a still further object of this invention 
to provide fungicidal compositions useful in carrying 
out those methods. Therefore, the present invention comprises 
compounds of the formula: 
 
wherein: 
Q isC1-C3 alkyl, C2-C3 alkenyl, C2-C3 alkynyl, 
-(CH2)mCH=, or -(CH2)m-X-(CH2)m- ; n is0 or 1; each m isindependently 0, 1, 2, or 3; each X isindependently O or S; R1 isC3-C12 cycloalkyl, C3-C12 cycloalkenyl, C6-C12 
bicycloalkyl, C3-C12
