<ABSTRACT>
In an air intake device in a helmet, a recess (8) is 
defined in a front wall of a shell (4) of a cap body (1) 

so as to be recessed inwardly of the shell, and has an 
opening (9) defined in an upper surface of the recess to 

communicate with the inside of the cap body. A shutter 
plate (10) is inserted into the opening (9) for opening 

and closing the recess (8). A guide rod (13) projects 
from a back surface of the shutter plate (10), so that it 

comes into sliding contact with an innermost wall of the 
recess (8) and is slidably received in a guide hole (12) 

provided in a lower wall of the recess (8). The shell 
(4) of the cap body (1) provides a shutter housing, 

thereby eliminating the need for a separate shutter 
housing and simplifying the air intake device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is helmets for
use mainly by an occupant on a motorcycle or a racing
car, and particularly, air intake devices for ventilation
of the inside of a cap body.Such air intake devices in the helmets are already
known, for example, from Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 7211/93. In the disclosed air intake
device, a shutter housing for vertically movably
retaining a shutter plate is joined to an outer surface
of a cap body, and an air intake hole capable of
communicating with an air duct in the cap body is
provided in the shutter housing.In these prior art air intake device, a shutter
housing separate from the cap body is required in order
to retain the shutter plate. Therefore, working steps
such as forming and mounting of the shutter housing are
an obstacle to a reduction in cost, and a simplification
in structure is desired.DE-U-8606296 describes a helmet having an air vent
which can be closed by a shutter plate or slide. Two
attachment projections are provided on the shutter plate
which retain the shutter plate to the air vent. These
projections hook through slotted openings or slits of the
air vent. The air vent is provided on a side of the
helmet and in one embodiment may be closed off by a
pivoting slide. The slide is pivotably connected to the
shell by a pivot pin which is fixed to the shell.The present invention seeks to provide an air intake device having
a stable support of a shutter plate which does not spoil the appearance
of the helmet. According to the present
invention, there is provided an air
intake device in a helmet, comprising: a shell of a cap
body formed with a recess which is recessed inwardly from a
front surface of the shell and is provided at an upper
surface of the recess with an opening which communicates
with the interior of the cap body; a shutter plate which is
vertically movable along an inner surface of the shell at a
position immediately above the recess for opening and
closing the recess; a guide rod projecting from a back
surface of the shutter plate to provide sliding contact with
an innermost wall of the recess; and a guide hole
provided in a lower wall of the recess for slidably
receiving said guide rod.With the above construction, it is possible for the
shell to retain the shutter plate, thereby
eliminating the need for a separate shutter housing,
which largely contributes to a simplification in structure
of the air intake device and to a reduction in production
cost.For a better understanding of the present invention,

<CLAIMS>
An air intake device in a helmet, comprising:

a shell (4) of a cap body (1) formed with a recess
(8) which is recessed inwardly from a front surface of

the shell (4) and is provided at an upper surface of the
recess (8) with an opening which communicates with the

interior of the cap body;
a shutter plate (10) which is vertically movable
along an inner surface of the shell (4) at a position

immediately above the recess (8) for opening and closing
the recess (8);
a guide rod (13) projecting from a back surface of
the shutter plate (10) to provide sliding contact with an

innermost wall of the recess (8); and
a guide hole (12) provided in a lower wall of the
recess (8) for slidably receiving said guide rod (13).
An air intake device according to claim 1,
wherein a small projection (16) is provided on the inner

surface of the shell (4) and a plurality of notches (15)
are provided on the front surface of the shutter plate

(10), the small projection (16) being engaged with
respective notches (15) at predetermined vertical

positions of the shutter plate (10) within the recess (8)
thereby to hold the shutter plate (10) in those

positions.
An air intake device according to claim 1,
wherein said shutter plate (10) has a knob (14) provided

at a lower edge thereof, the knob (14) projecting
forwardly of the recess (8).
An air intake device according to claim 3,
wherein said knob (14) defines a lifted full-open

position (A) of the shutter plate (10) by abutting
against an upper edge of the recess (8) and

defines a lowered full-closed position (B) of the shutter
plate (10) by abutting against a lower edge of the recess

(8). 
An air intake device according to any one of
the preceding claims, wherein a through hole (11) is

provided in the innermost wall of the recess (8) that
communicates the recess (8) with the interior of the cap

body (1).
