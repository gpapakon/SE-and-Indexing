<ABSTRACT>
A tire rasp blade for use in a tire buffing machine having a 
rotating hub. A set of rasp blades (10) is arranged in a plurality 

of circumferential rows. Each of the blades has a non-planar 
elongated body (12) with generally planar portions (14,16), and an 

arcuate working edge (20) having teeth (22) which extend in a 
direction generally parallel to the direction of hub rotation. The 

working edge includes two elliptical-shaped segments (24,26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tire rasp blade for use
in tire buffing machines. Relevant prior art is disclosed in
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,033,175, 4,019,234 and
2,703,446.Tire buffing machines are well known in the tire retreading
industry. Conventionally, a tire buffing machine includes both a
structure for mounting a used tire and a rasp hub which removes the
worn tread from the used tire prior to the retreading process. The
used tire is rotated while it is held against the rapidly rotating
rasp hub whose outside perimeter is provided with a multitude of
tire rasp blades. When so engaged against the used tire, the
blades cut or shear small segments of rubber from the worn tread
surface area of the tire. In this way, the tire is "buffed" to
remove the unwanted used tread and to achieve an evenly textured
surface suitable for retreading.Tire rasp blades, together with intervening spacers, are
assembled on the periphery of the rasp hub between the hub front
and back plates. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,703,446 and 4,019,234 disclose
such conventional prior art rasp hub assemblies wherein the back
plate of the hub has axially directed support pins on which are
mounted the rasp blades and spacers. The front plate is then 
assembled onto the support pins against the assembled blades and
spacers and locked into place.Use of bent blades with flat spacers is described in U.S.
Patent No. 5,033,175 which discloses a tire rasp blade having the
features of the preamble of Claim 1. This arrangement creates a
circumferentially
interlocked hub with less potential for mechanical failure at high
rotational speeds.It has been conventional practice to form the outer-most
portion or "working edge" of the tire rasp blade as a segment of a
circle. That is, the working edge is in the form of an arc defined
by a common radius. However, when such tire rasp blades are
assembled into a hub, they are inclined relative to the direction
of rotation of the hub. As a result, the actual geometry of the
working edge of each blade -- as it is rotated on the hub -- is no
longer circular relative to the surface of the tire being buffed.
In effect, as the buffing hub rotates, the working edge of the
inclined tire rasp blades cyclically move toward and away from the
surface of the tire. This, in turn, causes inefficient operation
and uneven buffing of the tire.The present invention
having the features of claim 1
is directed to a tire rasp blade
having elements whose shape and configuration affords it certain
advantages over prior art rasp blade

<CLAIMS>
A tire rasp blade (10) for use in a tire buffing
machine which includes a rotating hub, comprising:


an elongated, generally arcuate and nonplanar body
(12) having two generally planar end portions (14, 16)

each having first and second opposing sides, said
generally planar end portions (14, 16) intersecting in

a vertex (18) positioned at a mid-portion of said body;
and
a working edge (20) having two curved surfaces (24,
26),

characterised in that
each of said curved surfaces (24, 26) defines a
portion of an ellipse having unequal major and minor

axes and provides an effectively circular working edge
(20) when said blade (10) is mounted to and rotated on

said hub.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the two curved elliptical surfaces of said

working edge (20) intersect at said midpoint.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in Claim 1 or
Claim 2 wherein the angle each said planar end portion

(14, 16) makes with a plane normally intersecting the
rotating hub is approximately either 3° or 4°.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-3, wherein said blade (10) is symmetrical about its

longitudinal midpoint.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-4, wherein said working edge (20) includes a

plurality of teeth (22) all disposed at a uniform angle
relative to said blade body; said teeth (22) each 

having a leading edge and a trailing edge; said leading
edges of the teeth (22) of one planar end portion being

displaced to said first side of said body and the
leading edges of the teeth (22) of the other planar end

portion being displaced to said second side of said
body.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-4, wherein said working edge includes a plurality of

teeth (22) separated by a plurality of arcuate cutouts,
the vertex of said nonplanar body being located at a

tooth.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-6, wherein said body is generally rigid.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-7, wherein said body is conformable and resilient.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-8, wherein the working edge is induction-hardened.
A tire rasp blade (10) as claimed in any of Claims
1-9, further including two mounting holes, one

positioned at the midpoint of each of said planar end
portions.
A tire rasp blade (11) as claimed in any of Claims

1-10, wherein said working edge (20) includes a
plurality of teeth (22) all disposed at a uniform angle

relative to said blade body, said teeth (22) being in
substantially the same plane as the plane normal to the

axis of hub rotation; said teeth (22) each having a
leading edge and a trailing edge; the leading edges of

the teeth (22) of one planar end portion being
displaced to one side of said body and the leading

edges of the teeth (22) of the other planar end portion
being displaced to the other side of said body.
