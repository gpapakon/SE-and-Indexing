<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thiol and/or thioether-aralkyl 
nitrogen-containing hydrocarbons covalently 
bonded to inorganic solid supports and to processes for 
removing, separating and concentrating certain desired 
ions from solutions wherein such ions may be admixed 
with other ions which may be present in much higher 
concentrations by the use of such thiol and/or 
thioether-aralkyl nitrogen supported materials. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a process for 
removing such ions from an admixture with others in 
solution by forming a complex of the desired ions with 
compounds composed of a thiol and/or thioether-aralkyl 
nitrogen hydrocarbon bonded to an inorganic matrix by 
flowing such solutions through a column packed with such 
thiol and/or thioether-aralkyl nitrogen-solid supported 
materials and then selectively breaking the complex of 
the desired ion from the compounds to which such ion has 
become attached by flowing a receiving liquid in much  
 
smaller volume than the volume of solution passed 
through the column to remove and concentrate the desired 
ions in solution in the receiving liquid. The 
concentrated ions thus removed may then be recovered by 
known methods. Effective methods for the recovery and/or 
separation of particular ions such as platinum, 
ruthenium, palladium, copper, osmium, gold, silver, and 
mercury ions in either cation or complex anion form from 
solutions thereof, admixed with chelating agents and/or 
other ions which may be present, represent a real need 
in modern technology. As specific examples, efficient 
and economical separation of (1) small amounts of Pt, 
Pd, Au, Ag, Os, Cu, and/or Ru from Rh and/or Ir 
concentrates; (2) separation of Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, and/or 
Ru from solutions containing large amounts of base 
metals; and (3) separation of Cu and/or Hg as toxic 
wastes from acidic solutions, all represent real 
separation needs with presently either unsatisfactory 
technologies for their accomplishment, or for which more 
economical technologies are desired. These ions are 
often present at low concentrations in solutions 
containing other ions at much greater concentrations. 
Hence, there is a real need for a process to selectively 
concentrate and recover these ions. It is known that molecules containing both the 
thioether and/or thiol sulfur atoms, as well as amine  
 
nitrogen atoms, show strong and somewhat selective 
interactions with Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Os, Cu, Ru, and Hg 
ions under acidic conditions. These molecules also 
interact with
