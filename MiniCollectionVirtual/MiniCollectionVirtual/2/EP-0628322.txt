<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a distal end and a proximal end provided 

with a connecting means, at least one continuous channel and 
with a flexible part at the distal end.

 
In the flexible end-section a pull wire, extending through 

the channel to the outside of the proximal end, is attached 
so as to bend the end-section by pulling the pull wire. A 

bendable strip-like electrode is formed by a lateral surface 
portion of a wound wire, received in a depression in the end 

section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a controlled steerable 
catheter. A guiding catheter with a controllable distal tip 
is known from EP-A-0 361 314. The invention as characterized in claim 1 provides 
a controlled flexible intervential catheter with a strip-like 
electrode at its distal end. A catheter of this kind is 
for instance used for treating certain types of cardiac 
arrhythmias. With the catheter according to the invention the 
strip-like electrode can be positioned accurately against 
the wall of for instance a ventricle, in order to locally 
heat and ablate tissue when treating those types of cardiac 
arrythmias. The electrode does not hinder the flexing of the 
end part. The invention will be explained in greater detail 
in the following description with reference to the examples 
of the embodiments as shown in the drawings. 
Fig. 1represents a catheter according to the invention 
in the position of use. Fig. 2shows the end-section of a catheter according to a 
first embodiment of the invention in a partly 
longitudinal cross-sectional view. Fig. 3shows a section according to III-III in fig. 2 on 
a larger scale. Fig. 4is a partly schematic view of a catheter according 
to a second embodiment. Fig. 5shows a cross-section at V-V in fig. 4. Fig. 6shows a cross-section at VI-VI in fig. 4. As fig. 1 shows, a catheter 1 according to the 
invention can be advanced in the usual manner through a vein 
to the right ventricle in order to be positioned firmly 
against the wall 6 of the right ventricle of the heart 5. The catheter 1 comprises a basic body with a 
proximal end, in the usual manner provided with a connecting 
piece not shown here remaining outside the body, and a 
distal end comprising a flexible end-section 3. With this embodiment the wall of the flexible end-section 
is provided with a strip-like electrode extending in 
the longitudinal direction of the catheter, such as a 
heating element. The catheter 1 is manufactured in such a way that 
its end-section 3 can be bend reliably in a controlled 
fashion in order to place electrode 4 firmly against the 
wall 6. When the electrode 4 is a heating element, as 
described above, a certain section of the wall 6 can be 
heated in this way and consequently the tissue disturbed 
when treating certain types of cardiac arrhythmias. As fig. 2 shows in greater detail, the catheter 1 
is provided with an eccentrically positioned channel 7, in 
which a pull wire 11 has been incorporated. This pull wire 
has been fixed eccentrically in the end-section 3, by 
inco
