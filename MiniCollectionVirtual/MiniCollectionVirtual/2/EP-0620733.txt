<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and processes for their preparation are provided in which nifedipine is coated onto a water soluble carrier in a mixture with polyvinylpyrrolidone or a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate and a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic based polymer. The ratio of the polyvinylpyrrolidone or N-vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer to the content of nifedipine is in the range of from 1:1 to 1:10 and the ratio of the acrylic based polymer to the content of nifedipine is in the range of from 1:4 to 1:20. Compositions are provided which are suitable for once-a-day administration of nifedipine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
compositions containing nifedipine and to a process for the
preparation thereof. In particular the present invention
relates to a slow release pharmaceutical formulation
containing nifedipine which provides for a regular and
prolonged release pattern upon administration and, in its
most preferred form, may be administered once a day. The
invention also relates to a process for the preparation
thereof.The drug nifedipine is currently used in the form
of rapid release and comparatively slow release
pharmaceutical dosage forms for the treatment,
respectively, of acute angina and chronic hypertension.
It appears that, for the acute treatment of angina, it is
desirable quickly to attain relatively high nifedipine
concentrations in plasma and this requirement is currently
served by a preparation consisting of a solution of
nifedipine in low molecular weight polyethylene glycol
contained within soft gelatin capsules. For the treatment
of hypertension it appears that it is more desirable to
maintain plasma nifedipine concentrations within a much
lower concentration range. Modified release preparations 
of the substance are available for this purpose, although
they mostly still require multiple daily doses to be taken
which is both a clinical disadvantage in that symptomatic
control of the condition may not be optimised and a
disadvantage from the patient's point of view. The
inconvenience of taking a dosage more than once per day may
affect compliance with the dosage regime, also leading to
poor clinical performance.The reason for the two significantly different
types of formulation is that nifedipine perse is very
poorly soluble in water. Because of this many of the
patent specifications on controlled release systems of
nifedipine describe means of actually enhancing, rather
than suppressing, the solubility of nifedipine.Thus, in European Patent No. 0047899
(corresponding to Canadian Patent No. 1180277) control of
the dissolution of nifedipine is achieved by processing the
material to give it a large specific surface area of 0.5 to
6m2/g. The specification discloses the production of fine
nifedipine crystals by grinding and screening but not by
any other means.Similarly, in WO 86/01717 the control of
nifedipine dissolution is achieved by limiting its
specific surface area to 0.1 to 0.42m2/g and coating the
nifedipine crystals, in admixture with an equal quantity of
a filler, onto inert spheroids by means of suitable
binders.Further enhancement of the dissolution
