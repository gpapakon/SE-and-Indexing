<ABSTRACT>
An improved over-erased bit correction structure is 
provided for performing a correction operation on over-erased 

memory cells in an array of flash EEPROM memory 
cells after erase operation so as to render high 

endurance. Sensing circuitry (20) is used to detect 
column leakage current indicative of an over-erased bit 

during an APDE mode of operation and for generating a 
logic signal representative of data stored in the memory 

cell. A data input buffer circuit (26) is used to 
compare the logic signal and a data signal representative 

of data programmed in the memory cell so as to generate 
a bit match signal. A pulse counter (30) is coupled to 

the data input buffer circuit for counting a plurality of 
programming pulses applied thereto. The data input 

buffer circuit selectively connects only certain ones of 
the columns of bit lines to the pulse counter in which 

the bit match signal is at a high logic level so as to 
program back over-erased memory 
cells connected to only 
the certain ones of the columns of bit lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor integrated
circuit memory devices such as floating gate
memory devices such as an array of flash electrically
erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) cells.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
semiconductor integrated circuit memory device having an
over-erased bit correction structure for performing a
correction operation on over-erased memory cell in for example, an
array of flash EEPROM memory cells after erase operation
so as to render improved high endurance.As is generally known in the art, a new category of
electrically erasable EPROMs/EEPROMs has emerged in
recent years as an important non-volatile memory which
combines the advantages of EPROM density with EEPROM
electrical erasability and is sometimes referred to as
"flash" EPROM or EEPROM. In these flash memories, a
plurality of one-transistor flash EEPROM cells may be
formed on a semiconductor substrate in which each cell is 
comprised of a P-type conductivity substrate, an N-type
conductivity source region formed integrally with the
substrate, and an N-type conductivity drain region also
formed integrally within the substrate. A floating gate
is separated from the substrate by a thin dielectric
layer. A second dielectric layer separates a control
gate from the floating gate. A P-type channel region in
the substrate separates the source and drain regions.In order to program the flash EEPROM cell in conventional
operation, the drain region and the control
gate are raised to predetermined potentials above the
potential applied to the source region. For example, the
drain region has applied thereto a voltage VD of approximately
+5.5 volts with the control gate VG having a
voltage of approximately +12 volts applied for approximately
two or three microseconds. These voltages produce
"hot electrons" which are accelerated across the thin
dielectric layer and onto the floating gate. This hot
electro injection results in an increase of the floating
gate threshold by approximately two to four volts.For erasing the flash EEPROM cell in conventional
operation, a relatively high positive potential (i.e.,
+12 volts) is applied to the source region for a few
tenths of a second. The control gate is grounded, and
the drain region is allowed to float. A strong electric
field develops between the floating gate and the source
region, and negative charge is extracted from the
floating gate to the source region by way of Fowler-Norheim
tunneling. If an unprogrammed flash EEPROM cell
