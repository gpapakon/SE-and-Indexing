<ABSTRACT>
A framework, in particular an at least partially hollow framework, has nodes and members. The nodes (14) are formed by at least a projection (30) on a hollow framework member (12) and by at least a further hollow member mounted and secured thereon. Also disclosed is a process for producing this framework and its use in land, air and water vehicles, in building construction, in civil and underground engineering, scaffolds, shelving systems and furniture.

Process for producing a framework from junction
elements and bars, the junction elements being formed

by in each case one elevation on a hollow framework
part and on [sic]
 a further hollow part fitted and
fastened thereon, the hollow parts being produced by an

internal-high-pressure deformation process, having the
following steps:


providing a hollow profile;
positioning a hollow-profile section in a mould with
a widened portion in the deformation region;
applying an internal high pressure to the tube, with
the result that the tube wall is widened in the region

of the widened portion of the mould, with the hollow-profile
material simultaneously following along in the

direction of the longitudinal axis of the tube and a
closed elevation being produced;
removing the deformed hollow part with junction-element
region with closed elevations; and
fitting and fastening framework-bar sections on the
closed elevations.
Framework which is produced by the process of
Patent Claim 1 and has junction elements and bars, the

junction elements (14) being formed by at least one
closed elevation (30) on a hollow framework part and at

least one further hollow part fitted and fastened
thereon, the individual components thereof consisting

of the same material or of different materials.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to Claim 2, characterized in that the fibre

flow of the material in the junction element (14) runs
essentially parallel to the outer contours of the

junction element/bar part (12).
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that at

least the parts (12), which have the junction elements
(14), have a plurality of mutually parallel layers

which are located one above the other and are made of 
the same material or different materials, with mutually

parallel fibre flow.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that the materials have one or more layers made of
cold-workable material, such as a metal.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that it consists of steel and the wall thickness is
between 0.1 and 1.5 cm, preferably between 0.2 and

0.5 cm.
Framework according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that it consists essentially of light

metal, aluminium or an alloy thereof, or magnesium or
an alloy thereof.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that it has fibre-reinforced materials.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that it has different longitudinal sections and/or
different cross sections.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that at least one hollow part has depressions.
Framework with junction elements and bars
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that at least one hollow part has openings formed in
it.
Use of the framework according to one of Claims
2 to 11 for land, air and water vehicles, bicycle,

motorcycle and vehicle frames, building construction
and civil engineering, scaffolding, rack systems and

furniture.
