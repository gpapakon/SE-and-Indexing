<ABSTRACT>
In an image forming apparatus for simultaneously recording 
plural image lines (L1;L2) on a recording medium (5) by scanning 

simultaneously with plural light beams along parallel scanning 
lines in a primary scanning direction, two light beam 

detectors (B;C) each having a starting-side are arranged in such a 
way that the starting-sides are
 not in parallel to each other 
so that the distance between the starting-sides differs 

depending on the scanning line. The difference (T3) in the 
distances (T1;T2) of two light beams is measured, and the deviation 

between the two light beams is determined on the basis of the 
difference in the distances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus, and, in more detail, relates to an image forming 
apparatus in which a plurality of beams of light 
simultaneously scan a recording medium in a direction parallel 
to the primary scanning direction so that a plurality of lines 
are simultaneously recorded. (To differentiate deviation of 
beams of light from deviation of times, deviation of beams of 
light will be defined as slippage in this specification.) 
Particularly, the present invention relates to technology to 
detect slippages (as defined above) of the optical axis of the 
plurality of beams of light. In an image forming apparatus in which laser beams (beams 
of light), modulated according to an image signal, are 
reflected by a rotational polygonal mirror, and caused to scan 
a recording medium so that image information is recorded, the 
following has been widely known: the image forming apparatus 
is structured in the manner that a plurality of laser beams  
 
are used and a plurality of lines are simultaneously recorded, 
in order to increase the recording speed (refer to Japanese 
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 188713/1992). The features of the pre-characterising portion of 
Claim 1 are known from EP-A-412,038. US-A-4,206,348 discloses an optical scanner with electrooptical feed back 
for beam positioning of a single beam and 
US-A-5,105,296 discloses a method and 
apparatus for detecting the shape of a beam spot. In the case where a plurality of laser beams are caused 
to simultaneously scan the recording medium as described 
above, scanning positions of a plurality of laser beams are 
deviated in the primary scanning direction or secondary 
scanning direction, causing problems in which accurate image 
formation is adversely influenced. In view of the above described problems, an object of the 
present invention is to measure slippages of the optical axis 
of laser beams, particularly, in the secondary scanning 
direction by a simple structure, in an image forming apparatus 
which is structured in the manner that a plurality of laser 
beams is used for recording the image, and further to provide 
an appropriate apparatus to detect slippages of the optical 
axis in the secondary scanning direction and slippages of the 
optical axis in the primary scanning direction. Accordingly, the image forming apparatus, according to 
the present invention as defined in claim 1, causes a plurality of laser beams to 
simultaneously scan the recording medium in the direction
