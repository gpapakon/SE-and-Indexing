<ABSTRACT>
A novel liquid chromatography cartridge is disclosed, in particular for high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A simplified endpiece with sieving means is introduced into a tubular cartridge and retained in the tubular cartridge by frictional forces. The endpiece is sealed by radial forces. In the dismounted state, the outer diameter of the endpiece is larger than the inner diameter of the tubular cartridge.

Cartridge tube for liquid chromatography,
consisting of a tube (1) and an end piece (2) having a

sieve element (3), the end piece consisting of an
essentially cylindrical base body having a central bore

(6) and a flat cylindrical milled recess for the sieve
element, the base body having a bead which firmly holds

the sieve element, and the cylindrical base body having
a smooth cylindrical jacket, characterized in that the

end piece (2) is in one piece, was pressed into the
tube under pressure and is held in the tube by

frictional forces, and, in the disassembled state, the
external diameter of the end piece is greater than the

internal diameter of the tube (1).
Method for producing a cartridge tube according
to Claim 1, having the following procedural steps:


a) preparing a shaped blank made of plastic, for
example of Teflon, having a central bore and a

recess for the sieve element, by conventional
shaping processes;
b) inserting the sieve element into the recess
provided for this purpose;
c) beading the shaped blank on the end where the
sieve element is located, radial pressure being

exerted for the deformation;
d) final shaping of the end piece (external diameter,
connection device for eluting agent supply and

discharge line), the external diameter of the end 
piece being greater than the internal diameter of

the tube;
e) pressing the end piece into the tube under
pressure.
