<ABSTRACT>
A control device is constructed in the form of a plug adaptor and a control means that can interrupt the power to a dryer when the load is dry. The pattern of the power consumption of the dryer is used, together with a control algorithm, to provide the information needed for the control decision. The device provides a superior means of determining the cycle termination point which could also be incorporated directly into dryers at the point of manufacture. In addition, the invention provides a means of correlation between the moisture level and character of the laundry load with the pattern of power consumption of the clothes dryer. This correlation may be used to further optimize the performance of the drying cycle or to provide load-specific control and termination procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC CYCLE TERMINATOR FOR DRYERSThis invention relates to the control of dryers in general and in particular to electrically powered clothes dryers for residential use. BACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION Many electric clothes dryers have an automatic setting for the purpose of terminating the cycle when the clothes are dry, to save energy. However, many of the dryers now in use do not have this feature, and independent tests indicate that many models incorporating automatic termination still overdry the clothes, thereby wasting up to 20% of the electricity or more. Conventional automatic termination systems in dryers today may use the dryer temperature or the humidity of the air or the electrical conductivity of the load itself to determine when to terminate the cycle. Frequently, the decision is made by allowing a given amount of heater-on or heater-off time to elapse after a predetermined threshold is reached. This elapsed time is usually determined by a user set point on the control dial of the dryer.Consumer reports and tests by others indicate that while these automatic shut-off mechanisms are somewhat effective, they frequently overdry the loads, in many cases running longer than necessary, after the load is dry. This not only wastes energy, but it causes unnecessary wear on the fabric and to the dryer itself. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTIONThis invention seeks to improve upon the current means of control and in addition to provide a simple retrofit means whereby this improved control can be extended to existing clothes dryers, without modification to the interior wiring of the dryer itself. The improved means of control derives from two sources. First, it is recognized that since dryers seek to maintain an average air temperature in the drum during the drying cycle, then as the load dries, less and less power is required by the dryer to maintain this temperature as the quantity of water evaporating is reduced. This creates a relationship between the pattern of power used by the dryer and the moisture level and character of the load being dried. Hence by monitoring the power used by the dryer a means can be provided to 

 deteÏ€nine the end point of the drying cycle, which is not vulnerable to the drift of a sensor or to variations in any other external input.Secondly, in this invention, the determination of dryness is not based on one or two input variables or thresholds (such as a humidity threshold, or a user set point), but rather on a series of data derived from the energy used by the
