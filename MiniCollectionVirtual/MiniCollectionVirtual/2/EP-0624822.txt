<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed a leader (1) for use in 
developing a film (2), methods for attaching the leader (1) to the 

film (2) and for detaching it therefrom, and an apparatus for 
automatically attaching the leader to the film and 

detaching it therefrom. The apparatus for automatically 
attaching the leader to the film includes a leader set 

cover (20) for holding the leader (1), a leader guide (23) defining an 
arcuate path, leader feed means (22a) for feeding the leader (1) 

from the leader set cover (20) to the leader guide (23), leader 
backing means (B) for backing the leader to a leader 

controlling part (26) to curve the leader, and film feed means (29) 
for feeding the film toward an elongated opening of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a leader to be 
attached to the leading end of a film for leading the 
film, methods for attaching the leader to a film and for 
detaching it therefrom, and a developing apparatus with 
automatic attachment and detachment of the leader. There is an automatic developing apparatus of 
the type using a leader for transfer of a film, wherein 
the leader is attached to the leading end of the film for 
leading the film to go round in film processing tanks. In 
attaching the leader to the film, it is a conventional 
practice to set a cartridge on a splicing bed, cut a 
tongue portion of the film and bond the leader to the film 
with a splicing tape by hand. The aforementioned conventional developing 
apparatus involves a problem that time and labor are 
needed for attaching the leader to the film and the 
splicing tape must he exfoliated after completion of the 
film processsing. In addition, the apparatus presents 
another problem that time and labor must he taken for 
setting the leader attached to the film on the apparatus. EP-A-0 618 498, which was published after the priority 
date of the present application, discloses a leader to which films can be attached without tape. It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to overcome the foregoing problems and to 
provide a leader capable of being attached to and detached 
from a film without using a splicing tape, methods for 
attaching the leader to and detaching it from the film, 
and a developing apparatus with automatic attachment and 
detachment of the leader which realizes development of the 
film by merely setting a cartridge accommodating therein a 
roll of the film photographed on the apparatus at a 
predetermined position.  
 A first aspect of the present 
invention is as recited in claim 1. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method for attaching the 
aforesaid leader to the film, as recited in claim 2. According to yet another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method for detaching the 
leader from the film, as recited in claim 3.  
 According to still another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
automatically attaching the leader to the film, 
as recited in claim 4. According to a further aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
automatically detaching the leader from the film, 
as recited in claim 5.  
 With the leader of the present invention, a film 
having an engagement perforation at
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A film leader (1) attachable at one end portion 
thereof to a film (2) having an engagement perforation (7) in a 

leading end portion thereof, comprising: 

(a) a leader body; 
(b) a pawl (3) formed near one end of said leader body, projecting from a surface of said leader body, and having a 
tip (3a) oriented in a direction (A) in which said leader is to be 

fed in a developing apparatus; 
(c) an elongated opening (4) formed between said one end of said 
leader body and said pawl and having a length slightly 

larger than the width of said film, said opening having a 
longitudinal axis extending parallel to the edge of said one 

end of said leader body; and 
(d) a pressing plate (5) having a hole (8) for exposing said pawl, 
disposed on the face of said leader body from which said pawl 

projects and fixed to the surface of said leader body on a 
side opposite from said elongated opening 

with respect to said pawl so as 
to allow said film inserted between said pressing plate and 

said leader body through said elongated opening to slide 
therebetween until said engagement perforation of said film 

engages said pawl. 
A method for attaching the leader as recited 
in Claim 1 to the film as recited in Claim 1, 
comprising 
the steps of: 


(a) curving the leader at the one end portion thereof in 
such a manner that a transverse axis of the elongated 

opening extends in a circumferential direction of a 
resulting substantially circular arc and that the face of 

the leader body on which the pressing plate is disposed 
forms an inner periphery of the arc; and 
(b) inserting the film into the elongated opening from 
outside of the arc to engage the engagement perforation 

of the film with the pawl. 
A method for detaching the leader as recited  
 

in Claim 1 from the film as recited in Claim 1, comprising 
the steps of: 


(a) fixedly holding the leader attached to the film; 
(b) slightly moving the film toward the leader to 
disengage the engagement perforation from the pawl; and 
(c) drawing the film away from the leader while 
collapsingly pressing the pawl. 
An apparatus for automatically attaching the 
leader as recited in Claim 1 to the film as recited in 

Claim 1, comprising: 

(a) a leader set cover (20) for holding a plurality of leaders (1) 
in such a manner that each of the leaders is positioned as 

having the one end portion for film attachment lying 
rearward; 
(b) a leader guide (23) defining an arcuate path; 
(c) leader feed means (21, 22) for feeding each of the leaders held 
by the leader set cover to the leader guide; 
(d) leader backing means (24, 25), provided adjacent one end of the 
leader guide, for moving backward the leader fed to the 

leader guide; 
(e) a leader controlling part (26) for controlling the one end 
portion of the leader moved backward by the leader backing 

means to curve the one end portion of the leader along the 
leader guide; and 
(f) film feed means (27, 28, 29) for drawing the film out of a 
cartridge (6) accommodating the film in the form of a roll to 

feed the film toward the elongated opening of the leader 
being kept curved at the one end portion thereof, whereby 

the leading end of the film having the engagement 
perforation is attached to the leader. 
An apparatus for automatically detaching the 
leader as recited in Claim 1 from the film as recited in 

Claim 1, comprising: 

(a) leader feed means (41, 42, 43) for fixedly holding the leader 
attached to the film and then feeding the leader; 
(b) pawl pressing means (44,45) for collapsingly pressing the pawl  
 

of the leader; and 
(c) film forwarding and backing means (46, 47), provided adjacent 
the pawl pressing means and on a side adjacent a passage 

of the film, for forwarding and backing only the film with 
the leader fixedly held.
