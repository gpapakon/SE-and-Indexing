<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a conversion device which converts data expressed as a neural network representation to a relationship of fuzzy variables having the same dynamic content, or which converts data expressed as a relationship of fuzzy variables to a neural network representation with the same dynamic content. An aspect of the present invention is to have a neural network learn the input-output relationship which occurs when a fuzzy logic scheme is used exclusively or to have a fuzzy logic system learn the input-output relationship which occurs when a neural network is used exclusively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conversion apparatus
which converts data expressed as a neural network representation
to a relationship of fuzzy variables having the same
dynamic content, or which converts data expressed as a
relationship of fuzzy variables to a neural network representation
with the same dynamic content. This invention also
relates to an apparatus that optimizes evaluation functions by
searching at high speed for a combination of data which will
minimize a previously defined evaluation function.In a neural network, it is known to employ a learning
algorithm known as back propagation to automatically obtain a
relationship which exists between input and output. Back
propagation is well known in the art. In a system using
fuzzy logic, a non-linear relationship can easily be
expressed in terms of IF-THEN rules, and membership functions
which are comprehensible to humans. Examples of fuzzy
algorithms are also well known in the art.However, several drawbacks are inherent in neural
networks and fuzzy logic schemes individually. For example,
when a neural network is used exclusively, a long time is
required for learning, and sometimes learning is not
completed. Furthermore, when a neural network is used
exclusively, it is difficult for a human to intuitively
understand what method (or rules) are being applied to derive
the output which is the result of the learning. On the other
hand, when a fuzzy logic scheme is used exclusively, there is 
no inherent learning algorithm available, like back
propagation. Thus, a great deal of trial and error time is
required to fine-tune the parameters of the fuzzy rules and
membership functions to arrive at a desired output with
requisite precision. Furthermore, the exclusive use of a
fuzzy logic scheme limits the capability for expressing non-linear
functions.To overcome such inherent drawbacks, attention has
focused on combining neural networks and fuzzy logic schemes,
since the strengths of one scheme have been found to
compensate for the drawbacks of the other. An example of an
existing neural network fuzzy conversion device using both a
neural network and fuzzy logic is described in the published
paper by S. Horikawa, T. Furuhashi, S. Okuma and Y. Uchikawa
entitled "A Learning Fuzzy Controller Using a Neural Network"
published in Volume 27, No. 2 of the Japanese Proceedings of
S.I.C.E. (Society of Instrumentation and Control Engineering)
