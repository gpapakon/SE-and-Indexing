<ABSTRACT>
The method for combining datastreams in Uplink Macro Diversity in a cellular mobile radio network provides for the signal transmitted by a mobile radio station being received at the same time by a number of base stations which are within range. These will transmit the received datablocks to a unit located at a junction point, in such a manner that reliability information present at the base station is added to each bit of a datablock. In the combining unit, a bit-by-bit decision is made on the forwarding of the datastreams, the combining of which is implemented by means of a suitable combining method.

<CLAIMS>
Method for combining data streams with uplink
macro-diversity in a cellular mobile radio network,

characterized in that the signal transmitted by a

mobile station (MS) is received simultaneously by a
plurality of base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3) situated

within range and the received data blocks are
transmitted by these base stations to a unit (V)

located at a combination point in such a way that a
reliability information item (λ
1
, λ
2
 , ..., λ
N
) present
in the base station is added to each bit (Bit 1, Bit 2,

..., Bit N) of a data block, and in that a bit-by-bit
decision is made in the combination unit (V) regarding

the forwarding of the data streams whose uniting is
realized by a combination method.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the combination method is a soft decision process.
