<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a prepolymer epoxy resin mixture with oxazolidinone structures, a filler-containing thermally polymerizable reaction resin mixture of polyepoxy resin, consisting of a mixture of bi- and multifunctional epoxy resins, and polyisocyanate resin, with a molar ratio of the epoxy groups to the isocyanate groups of 
>
 1, is fed to a continuously working reactor. With substituted imidazole as reaction accelerator, amounting to 0.5-2.5 % of the polyepoxy resin, the reaction resin mixture is then reacted at temperatures up to 200  C, with reactor temperature at 140-190  C, and following that the extruded material is cooled down to 
<
 50  C with the aid of a cooling device mounted at the extrusion die outlet of the reactor.
