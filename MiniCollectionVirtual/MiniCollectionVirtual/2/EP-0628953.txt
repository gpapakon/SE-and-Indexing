<ABSTRACT>
Reproduced signals from detectors 1a to 1c installed in 
an optical head are level-adjusted by amplifiers 2a to 2c. 

Output signals of the amplifiers 2a and 2b are delayed by 
respective delay circuits 6a and 6b. An output signal of the 

delay circuit 6b and an output signal of the amplifier 2c are 
subtracted from an output signal of the delay circuit 6a by an 

adder 4. A reproduced signal from which cross-talk resulting 
from the adjacent track has been removed is obtained from the 

adder 4. The delay amounts of the delay circuits 2a and 2b are 
set according to delay control signals 8a and 8b. The delay 

amounts are set when accessing to a fixed pattern recording 
area disposed on a predetermined position of the optical disk. 

A control circuit 5 measures a time difference between the 
output signal of the detector 1b and the output signal of the 

detector 1c to output a delay control signal 8a. The control 
circuit 5 measures a time difference between the output signal 

of the detector 1a and the output signal of the detector 1c to 
generate a delay control signal 8a.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cross-talk canceler, 
and more particularly to a cross-talk canceler used in a signal 
reproducing unit for an optical disk. In order to improve a recording density of an optical 
disk medium, there is a tendency to narrow the distance between 
adjacent recording tracks on the medium. On the other hand, 
there is a limit to lessen a diameter of a read light beam. 
For that reason, if the distance between the recording tracks 
is made exceedingly short , the read optical beam is irradiated 
on a part of the adjacent track with the result that a signal 
which has been recorded on the adjacent track is mixed into a 
reproduced signal as a cross-talk component. A cross-talk canceler has been used as the technique of 
removing the inter-track cross-talk. For example, Japanese 
Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho 64-49134 (JP-A-49134/1989) 
discloses the technique in which the cross-talk is 
removed by use of three optical beam consisting of one main 
beam and two sub-beams. In this conventional technique, there 
are provided a main detector for receiving a reflected light of 
a main beam which has been irradiated on a desired track and 
two sub-detectors for receiving reflected lights of two sub-beams 
which have been irradiated on the tracks adjacent to the  
 
desired track, respectively. Then, the delayed and gain-adjusted 
signals output from the two sub-detectors are 
subtracted from the delayed signal output from the main 
detector to thereby reduce the inter-track cross-talk. The 
amount of delay to be added to the respective output signals of 
the main detector and one of the sub-detectors must be strictly 
adjusted in accordance with the respective distances of the 
beam spots on the optical disk and the rotational speed of the 
optical disk. Therefore, in the conventional technique, it is 
necessary to adjust the amount of delay for such detectors when 
manufacturing. Further, the respective distances of the main 
beam and the sub-beams are changed as a result of change in the 
passage of time of optical components within the optical head, 
whereby the optimum amount of delay is changed. Consequently, 
it is required to periodically readjust the amount of delay for 
the respective detectors. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
cross-talk canceler for an optical disk reading mechanism which 
does not require the adjustment and/or readjustment of the 
above-mentioned amount of delay. According to the present invention, there is provided
