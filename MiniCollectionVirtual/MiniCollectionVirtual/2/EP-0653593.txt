<ABSTRACT>
Steam-operated food cooking oven, comprising a cooking 
cavity (2), a motor-driven fan (3) located on the rear 

side of said cooking cavity (2), a partition wall (4) to 
distribute the flow of air generated by said fan, a back-chamber 

(5) accomodating said fan and delimited on its 
front side by said partition wall (4) and, on its rear 

side, by the rear wall (6) of the oven and a tube (9) 
inserted between the outer and the inner side of said 

cooking cavity (2), where the same tube terminates with a 
nozzle (10), an appropriate temperature sensing means 

(11) connected with a thermostat device (12) being 
inserted in said tube (9) where said tube (9) enters said 

back-chamber (5) from the outside by passing through said 
rear wall (6), whereas its nozzle (10) is accomodated in 

the interstice (13) formed therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a food cooking oven
with fan-assisted operation, which is adapted to also
cook foods by "steaming", ie. to perform the type of
cooking which makes use of the appropriate inlet of water
or steam into the cooking cavity so as to create special
food cooking conditions and effects inside said cooking
cavity.In the following description reference is made in
particular to a food cooking oven of the type intended
for use in catering operations, professional kitchens and
similar applications. It will however be appreciated that
what is described and claimed in connection thereto in
this patent actually applies to any kind whatsoever of
food cooking ovens, as far as they are provided with a
forced-convection feature and said "steaming" capability
for cooking foods.It is generally known that, when foodstuffs are cooked
in an oven, the related process can be carried out 
according to different methods and under widely differing
conditions, depending on the actual results and effects
that one wishes to reach. In this connection, one of the
most widely appreciated cooking methods is certainly the
so-called steaming process consisting of letting water or
steam into the cooking cavity.This particular cooking method is widely known, so
that it shall not be dealt with any farther herein,
except for a mere mention of the European patent
specifications nos. 0 386 862 (Lechmetall) and 0 183 009,
as well as to the US patent specification no. 4,856,422,
which may be considered as representing a valid reference
to the actual state of the art.Systems used to let steam into the cooking cavity of
cooking ovens with fan-assisted operation are further
widely known to make generally use of both a boiler
arrangement located outside the cooking cavity for the
generation of steam and a conduit provided to convey said
steam from said boiler into said cavity. In such forced-convection/steaming
ovens the need is particularly felt
for appropriate provisions allowing for the flow of the
steam being let into the cooking cavity to be regulated
in accordance with the actual cooking requirements. As a
matter of fact, if such provisions are not available, the
corresponding usage of energy (power or gas) of such
ovens for generating steam, along with the consumption of
cooling water used to possibly bring about (with an
appropriate arrangement) a condensation feature for the
steam that is generated in excess of the actual needs,
would turn out as being particularly high.To regulate tie flow rate of the steam

<CLAIMS>
Steam-operated food cooking oven, comprising an
access door (1), a cooking cavity (2), a motor-driven fan

(3) located on the rear side of said cooking cavity and
provided with an internal disk (15), a partition wall (4)

to distribute the flow of air generated by said fan, a
back-chamber (5) accomodating said fan and delimited by

said partition wall (4) on its front side and by the
rear wall (6) of the oven on its rear side, a conduit (7)

adapted to transfer steam from an external boiler (8)
into said cooking cavity, and a tube (9) inserted between

the outer and the inner side of said cooking cavity (2),
where the same tube terminates with a nozzle (10), an

appropriate temperature sensing means (11) connected with
a thermostat means (12) being inserted in said tube (9),


characterized in that
 said tube (9) enters said back-chamber
(5) from the outside by passing through said rear

wall (6), whereas its nozzle (10) is accomodated in the
interstice (13) formed between the rear wall (6) and the

rear portion of the fan (3).
Steam-operated food cooking oven according to claim
1, comprising also an internal disk (15) fitted onto the

shaft (16) of the motor (17), 
characterized in that
 a
plurality of openings (14) passing through said disk are

provided in said internal disk (15).
