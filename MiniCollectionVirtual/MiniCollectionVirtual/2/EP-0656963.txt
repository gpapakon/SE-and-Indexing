<ABSTRACT>
A heating device is disclosed for a running thermoplastic thread guided along a heated surface over heating bars. The heat flow on the thread is variable, in particular by modifying the height or the width of the heating bars, and/or by modifying the contact length with the thread. For that purpose the heating bars may be adjustable and/or the path of the thread may be varied by means of thread guides.
