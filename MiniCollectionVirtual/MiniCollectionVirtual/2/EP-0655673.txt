<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a circuit for slowing down or inhibiting the output of clock
pulses to a microprocessor based system, initiated by a specific trigger condition and
lasting for a specific period of time, the so-called nap-period, and further concerns a
method for slowing down or inhibiting the output of clock pulses to a microprocessor
based system, initiated by a specific trigger condition and lasting for a predetermined
time, the so-called nap period, wherein the output of system clock pulse signals to
the microprocessor based system is slowed down or inhibited during this nap period.In this invention, the NAP refers to a short wait period
during which power savings are achieved by reducing the number
of system circuit elements that are clocked or that are
clocked at full speed, since clock frequency is proportional
to power consumption.The NOP function commonly used in computer systems today
derives its name from a no-operation function. This
instruction allows the execution of a no-operation state in
order to create a short time delay. Most microprocessor based
systems today provide some type of NOP function which only
serves to create a place holder in the processor instruction
queue or to implement a fixed length short delay. In a
typical microprocessor based system, the clock to the system 
remains fully active and the system power remains at peak
levels during a NOP function.In prior art systems, computers or microprocessor based
systems have typically had to execute large numbers of NOPs or
other types of dummy instructions to provide for delays of
longer than one instruction cycle. One common problem with
this type of methodology was that it suffered from large speed
variations when the same programs were run on processors
having different execution speeds.In addition to a NOP function, another method commonly
used to effect a wait period is to program a system timer or
clock function to trigger an interrupt with an appropriate
delay. However, this is substantially more complicated,
requires additional system resources, and still requires that
peak power be used needlessly.Typically, power wasted in a system while in general use
or during the execution of an operation intended specifically
to do nothing has not been an issue as little or no
consideration has previously been given to the power
consumption of the system. With the desire for extended
battery life in battery operated microprocessor based systems
and energy conservation in AC electrically powered
