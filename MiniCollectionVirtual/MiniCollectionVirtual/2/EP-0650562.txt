<ABSTRACT>
The aircraft brake vibration damper (30, 60) comprises a mesh material (30, 60) located at axially extending spaced-apart side walls (22) of a spline (12) of a torque tube (10) so that the mesh material (30, 60) is located between the spline (12) and a metal cover cap (20, 50) for the spline (12). The mesh material (60) can extend about the torque tube (10) and splines (12) and completely over a top surface (17) of each spline (12). The mesh material (80) can be located in a cavity (75) of heat shield segments (70) located between the splines (12). The mesh material (30, 60, 80) may be a knit or woven damping material (30, 60, 80) that dampens vibrations during brake operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
aircraft brake, and in particular to a vibration damper for 
an aircraft brake with carbon-carbon composite discs. Aircraft disc brakes can exhibit severe vibration 
characteristics due to various self-excitation mechanisms. 
One class of vibration modes, commonly described as 
"squeal", results in a torsional windup of the stationary 
parts of the brake. While the modes are of a distributive 
spring-mass system nature, the elements include stationary 
carbon-carbon composite friction discs (stators, pressure 
plate, backing plate), torque tube, piston actuator, and 
other components. The stationary friction discs might be 
idealized as lumped angular inertia elements coupled to 
torque tube spline interfaces with equivalent disc elastic 
and damping elements. The torque tube and other structural 
elements might be typically idealized by additional angular 
inertia, spring and damping elements. Squeal vibration 
occurs when velocity dependent brake torques result in 
"negative damping" and the negative damping exceeds the 
effective positive damping in the distributive system. 
Negative damping is usually associated with the partial 
derivative of the brake torque with respect to slip 
velocity ("negative slopes"). U.S. Patent No. 5,143,184 
discloses damping mechanisms located within the carbon-carbon 
composite brake discs. Because of the higher 
temperatures associated with the use of carbon discs in 
aircraft brakes, heat shields are typically attached to the 
outer diameter or to the inner diameter, or to both, of a 
torque tube. Unfortunately, simple sheet heat shields are 
lightly damped. The brake squeal modes will tend to excite 
the high frequency modes of heat shields and result in 
cracking, chipping, etc. due to fatigue. These failed heat 
shield elements may then migrate or find their way into the 
area between the torque tube splines and the inner diameter  
 
slots of the stators and cause damage to the carbon-carbon 
composite stators. It is highly desirable to provide a 
mechanism for implementing positive damping between the 
carbon-carbon composite friction discs and the splines of 
the torque tube. Because of the high temperatures 
experienced in this region, the damping mechanism must be 
able to operate in the range of up to 550°C for normal 
braking surface, and in the range of approximately 1100°C 
for emergency or rejected take-off temperatures. The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing in an
