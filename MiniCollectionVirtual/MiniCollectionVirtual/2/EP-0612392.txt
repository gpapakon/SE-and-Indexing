<ABSTRACT>
A lamp stand (1) is provided which has a ground-engaging base (2), a vertical support member (3) carried on the base, a carriage (10) movable along the support member, and an arm (11) on the carriage for attachment of a photographic lamp (9). The carriage (10) is mounted on the support member (3) so as to be slidable along the support member (3) to adjust its vertical position simply by manually applying a lifting force to a portion of the lamp (9) and raising or lowering the lamp to the required height, and so that, when the lamp (9) is subsequently released on reaching of the required height, the carriage (10) is fixedly held in that position on the support member (3) by frictional engagement with the support member. This renders adjustment of the height of the lamp particularly straightforward.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lamp stands and is more 
particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with 
photographic lamp stands. In studio photography, lighting of a subject is very 
commonly achieved by use of powerful photographic lamps 
supported by specially adapted stands. The positioning of 
the lamps and their orientation can be critical to the 
particular lighting effects to be obtained, and it is 
therefore important that the lamps should be adjustable in 
height on their stands. Whilst such height adjustment is 
generally a feature of such stands, it normally involves 
some clamping arrangement which must be loosened to permit 
the lamp to be lowered or raised on the stand and 
subsequently tightened to lock the lamp in the required 
position. US-A-4463413 discloses an adjustable photographic 
light stand comprising a base, a vertical support member 
extending upwardly therefrom, and a carriage mounted on the 
support member so as to be slidable therealong to adjust 
its vertical position and supporting a boom arm carrying a 
lamp. In order to effect vertical or lateral adjustment of 
the lamp, a brake assembly must be initially released and 
then subsequently re-engaged manually. FR-A-2 226 890 discloses another lamp stand 
which has a frictional brake assembly, but which 
does not permit smooth running of the carriage 
along the support member. It is an object of the invention to provide a lamp 
stand which is particularly easily adjustable. According to the present invention there is provided 
a lamp stand comprising a ground-engaging base, a vertical  
 
support member carried on the base, a carriage surrounding 
the support member and mounted so as to be slidable 
therealong to adjust its vertical position, and attachment 
means on the carriage for attaching a lamp thereto, the 
vertical position of the carriage being adjustable by 
application of a lifting force to a portion of the lamp so 
as to pivot the carriage about a horizontal axis from a 
holding position to a release position and by raising or 
lowering of the lamp to a required height, wherein the 
support member comprises two vertical support surfaces 
extending parallel to one another on opposite sides of the 
support member, and the carriage incorporates braking 
portions which are forced into engagement with said support 
surfaces by the weight of the lamp acting on the carriage 
when the carriage is in the holding position so as to 
frictionally hold the carriage in the required vertical 
position on the support member and

<CLAIMS>
A lamp stand comprising a ground-engaging base (2), 
a vertical support member (3) carried on the base (2), a 

carriage (10) surrounding the support member (3) and 
mounted so as to be slidable therealong to adjust its 

vertical position, and attachment means (11) on the 
carriage for attaching a lamp (9) thereto, the vertical 

position of the carriage being adjustable by application of 
a lifting force to a portion of the lamp so as to pivot the 

carriage about a horizontal axis from a holding position to 
a release position and by raising or lowering of the lamp 

to a required height, wherein the support member (3) 
comprises two vertical support surfaces extending parallel 

to one another on opposite sides of the support member, and 
the carriage (10) incorporates braking portions (13, 14) 

which are forced into engagement with said support surfaces 
by the weight of the lamp (9) acting on the carriage (10) 

when the carriage is in the holding position so as to 
frictionally hold the carriage in the required vertical 

position on the support member and which are disengaged 
from said support surfaces when the carriage is pivoted 

into the release position by application of said lifting 
force, characterised in that roller means (15, 16)are 

provided on the carriage (10) which engage said support 
surfaces of the support member when the carriage is in the 

release position to permit sliding of the carriage along 
the support member during raising or lowering of the lamp. 
A lamp stand according to Claim 1, characterised in  
 

that the brake portions (13,14) are offset relative to one 
another longitudinally of the support member (3), and the 

attachment means (11) for the lamp (9) is provided on the 
carriage (10) on the same side of the support member (3) as 

the lower brake portion (14) so that the weight of the lamp 
(9) tends to pivot the carriage (10) into the braking 

position. 
A lamp stand according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the roller means includes respective 

rollers (15, 16) for engaging said support surfaces of the 
support member (3) when the carriage (10) is in the release 

position. 
A lamp stand according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the carriage (10) is partially 

supported by counterbalance means comprising a weight (17) 
connected to an upper portion of the carriage (10) by a 

cable (18) running over a pulley (19). 
A lamp stand according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that locking means (22A) are provided for 

selectively locking the carriage (10) with respect to the 
support member (3). 
A lamp stand according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the attachment means comprises a 

transverse arm (11) to which the lamp (9) is releasably 
attachable by pivot means (25 to 32) enabling the lamp to 

be pivoted about two axes extending perpendicularly to one 
another. 
A lamp stand according to any preceding claim,  
 

characterised in that the ground-engaging base (2) has 
wheels (8). 
A lamp stand according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the ground-engaging base (2) has a 

latching mechanism (40) permitting the base to be 
releasably coupled to the base of a further, similar lamp 

stand.
