 INORGANIC FOUNDRY BINDER SYSTEMS AND THEIR USESTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to inorganic no-bake foundry binder systems and their uses. The binder 5 systems comprise as separate Part A and Part B<-. components: (A) an aqueous solution of specified phosphoric acids, and (B) a mixture comprising (1) an iron oxide selected from the group consisting of (a) ferrous oxide, (b) ferroferric oxide, and (c) mixtures 10 thereof and (2) magnesium oxide. The binder systems are used to prepare foundry mixes which are used to prepare foundry molds and cores. The foundry molds and cores are used to cast metals.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION15 There is considerable interest in developing an inorganic foundry binder which has the performance characteristics of commercial organic foundry binders. Organic foundry binders, particularly those based upon polyurethane chemistry, have been used in the casting20 industry for several decades in both the no-bake and cold-box processes. This is because they produce foundry molds and cores with acceptable tensile strengths that shakeout of castings with relative ease. The castings prepared with these foundry molds25 and cores have a good surface finish with only minor defects.Currently, the effects of organic foundry binders on the environment and health are under study. Consequently, there is an interest in considering30 alternative binders in case these studies are negative. Inorganic foundry binders are of particular interest because they are not subject to some of the concerns associated with organic foundry binders.Various compositions of inorganic foundry binders35 are known. See for example U.S. Patent 3,930,872 

 which describes an inorganic foundry binder comprising boronated aluminum phosphate and an oxygen-containing alkaline earth metal in specified amounts. Although these binders produce molds and cores that have adequate strength and shakeout easily from metal casting prepared with them, the binders are not very flovable and do not mix well with the aggregate. Furthermore, molds and cores prepared with these binders do not exhibit adequate humidity resistance. As another example of an inorganic foundry binder, see U.S. Patent 4,111,705 which describes an inorganic no-bake foundry binder comprising orthophosphoric acid, a ferrous oxide containing â€¢ material, and a water-soluble alkali metal or ammonium salt of certain carboxylic acids. Another patent, U.S. Patent 4,430,441, describes a no-bake inorganic foundry binder comprising from 95-99
