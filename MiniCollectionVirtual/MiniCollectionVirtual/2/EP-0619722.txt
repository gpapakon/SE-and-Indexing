<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a simple, safe and effective method for treating bone and making it suitable for transplantation comprising: a) contacting said bone with a global decontaminating agent effective to inactivate bacteria, fungi, virus and parasites; b) cleaning said bone; and c) terminally decontaminating said cleaned bone by contacting it with a global decontaminating agent effective to inactivate bacteria, fungi, virus and parasites. The invention also provides a method of cleaning bone which can be used in step (b) of the method described above and comprises contacting the bone with detergent under high pressure washing conditions at elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
processing bone for eventual transplantation. The method
of the invention offers a simple, safe and effective way
to produce clean, decontaminated bone for
transplantation. In particular, the invention offers an
effective method of cleaning bone comprising contacting
bone with detergent under high pressure washing
conditions and elevated temperatures. In preferred
embodiments the invention involves contacting the bone
with a global decontaminating agent effective to
inactivate a wide range of infectious agents including
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites; cleaning the
bone; and terminally decontaminating the bone with a
global decontaminating agent effective to inactivate a
wide range of infectious agents including bacteria,
viruses, fungi and parasites.The procurement and processing of human bone
for transplantation has not changed significantly since
the 1950s. It remains a complicated task which requires
the coordinated efforts of several groups including the
donor's family, the hospital staff, the local procurement
group, the blood specimen processing laboratory, the bone
processing laboratory, the transplant patient, and the
transplant team.A prime consideration is minimization of the
risk of transferring potentially harmful diseases to
tissue recipients. Viruses and bacteria can now be
transmitted by the bone as well as the marrow. See 
Kakaiya et al., "Tissue transplant-transmitted
infections," Transfusion 31 (3)1277-284, 1991; Shutkin,
"Homologous-serum hepatitis following use of refrigerated
bone-bank bones, report of a case," J. Bone Joint Surg.
36-A160, 1954. Transmission of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) via bone as well as bone marrow has also been
reported. "Transmission of HIV through bone
transplantation case report and public health
recommendations" Novbid. Mortal Weekly Rep., 37:597-599,
1988. Furlini et al., "Antibody response to human
immunodeficiency virus after infected bone marrow
transplant," Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect Dis,
7(5)554-665, 1988. Furthermore, HIV has been cultured
from fresh as well as refrigerated bone and freeze-dried
bone. Buck et al. "Human immunodeficiency virus cultured
from bone. Implications for transplantation." Clin.
Ortho., 251:249-253, 1990. Protection of the bone
processing laboratory technician is another consideration
which has become more pressing in recent years because of
the possibility of HIV and hepatitis B transmission.Current bone procurement and processing
procedures have been designed

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning bone comprising
contacting the internal matrix of 
said
 bone with a
detergent solution under high pressure washing

conditions, wherein said high pressure provides a
force sufficient to drive said detergent solution into

the internal matrix of the bone.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
high pressure washing conditions include vigorous

agitation.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
high pressure washing conditions include contacting

said bone with a high pressure liquid jet stream.
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said
high pressure liquid jet stream is 690 kPa to 21000 kPa

(100 to 3000 psi).
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said
high pressure liquid jet stream is 3450 kPa to 10500 kPa

(500 to 1500 psi).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said cleaning is carried out at an elevated

temperature.
A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein said
cleaning is conducted at a temperature between 37째C

and 80째C.
A method as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7
wherein said temperature is between 37째C and 60째C. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claims
wherein said detergent is a non-ionic detergent.
A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein said
non-ionic detergent is octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol.
A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein said
non-ionic detergent is polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan

monooleate.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said detergent solution also comprises a

global decontaminating agent effective to inactivate
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
A method as claimed in claim 12 wherein said
global decontaminating agent is an iodophor.
A method as claimed in claim 13 wherein said
iodophor is polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine.
A method as claimed in any preceding claims
wherein said bone is additionally contacted with

hydrogen peroxide.
A method as claimed in any preceding claims
wherein, following said cleaning, said bone is

terminally decontaminated by contacting it with a
global decontaminating agent effective to inactivate

bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
A method as claimed in claim 16 wherein,
prior to said cleaning, said bone is decontaminated by

a global decontaminating agent effective to inactive
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. 
A method as claimed in either of claims 16
or 17 wherein said global decontaminating agent is an

iodophor.
A method as claimed in claim 18 wherein,
following said terminal decontamination, said iodophor

is inactivated by reaction with a reducing agent.
A method as claimed in claim 19 wherein said
reducing agent is ascorbic acid or salts thereof.
A method as claimed in claim 20 wherein said
salt of ascorbic acid is sodium ascorbate.
A method as claimed in claim 16 wherein, the
global decontaminating agent used for terminal

decontamination is left on the bone in order to coat the
bone.
A method as claimed in claim 22 wherein said
global decontaminating agent is an iodophor.
A method as claimed in any of claims 17 to
22 wherein said global decontaminating agent is polyvinylpyrrolidone

iodine.
