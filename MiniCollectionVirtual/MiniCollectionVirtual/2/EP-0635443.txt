<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aligning device for products such as fruits moving in a layer through a channel by means of a water current, with a view to supplying a conveyor with n parallel transportation lines (3). This device comprises, on the one hand, n tubular conduits (5) having a section which is adapted to permit the passage of a product, which conduits are juxtaposed longitudinally and partially submerged, each of the said conduits being arranged in the channel so as to deliver the products in line with a transportation line (3) and, on the other hand, means (11-16) for rotationally driving the conduits (5) and capable of making them turn on themselves about their longitudinal axis.

Aligning device for products like fruits moving in a
layer through a channel (1; 18) by means of a water

current, in order to feed a conveyor (2; 19) having n
parallel transport lines (3; 20), characterized in that

it comprises:

n tubular conduits (5; 21, 22) having a cross-section
adapted to allow the passage of one product, said

conduits being longitudinally juxtaposed and partially
immersed, wherein each one of said conduits comprises an

upstream inlet end for the products and a downstream
outlet end for the products, and each conduit is arranged

in the channel (1; 18) in such a manner that the
downstream end thereof is in alignment with one transport

line (3; 20);
means (11-16; 25-31, 33-41) for rotatively driving said
conduits (5; 21, 22), able to rotate them around their

longitudinal axis.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that the conduits (5; 21, 22) are positioned in the

channel so as to be half-immersed.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the conduits (5) comprise one so-called

uptsream end, opposed to the conveyor (2), which
is lined with a rim (8) of a shock absorbing material.
Apparatus acording to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that each cond
uit (5) is cylindrical.
Apparatus acording to claim 4, characterized in that
each conduit (5) comprises an internal surface provided 

with longitudinal and helical ribs (17) able to form the
equivalent of a worm screw within said conduits.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in
that each conduit (5) comprises three helical ribs (17)

distributed around the longitudinal axis of said conduit.
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 or 6,
characterized in that each helical rib (17) has a pitch

substantially in the range between 200 mm and 1 m.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the means (11-16; 25-31, 33-41) for

rotatively driving the conduits (5; 21, 22) are adapted
to rotate said conduits at a rotational speed

substantially in the range between 10 rpm and 60 rpm.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the conduits (5) extend between two

vertical flanges (6, 7) provided with openings conjugated
to the cross-section of said conduits.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the rotatively driving means

comprise a gear-motor (11), a distribution shaft (13)
arranged transversally above the conduits (5) and at

least one belt (16) arranged to wrap said conduits.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that each conduit (21, 22) has a frustoconical

shape tapering in the feeding direction of the
products. 
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in
that each conduit (21, 22) has a so-called downstream

terminal section (21b, 22b) with a circular shape
arranged to cooperate with a flexible transmission member

(25) able to rotatively drive said conduit.
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterized in
that the conduits (21, 22) have so-called upstream ends

(21a, 21b) supported by a vertical flange (24), and
downstream ends supported in a loop of the transmission

member (25).
Apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 13,
wherein the channel (18) has a width greater than said

conveyor (19), said apparatus being characterized in that
it comprises baffles (42, 43) adapted to direct the water

towards the tubes (21, 22).
