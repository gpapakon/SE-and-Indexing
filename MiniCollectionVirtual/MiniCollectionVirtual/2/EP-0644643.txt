<ABSTRACT>
A device for driving a load is described, in particular a warning lamp in a motor vehicle. A load and a first switching means are connected in series. If a signal which exceeds a specific value is present at a control input, then a safety function is active and the first switching means enables the flow of current through the load. The control input is connected to a self-latching means which provides a signal which exceeds the specific value.

<CLAIMS>
Device for driving a warning device (100) in a
motor vehicle, having a series circuit comprising the

warning device (100) and a first switching means (130),
the first switching means (130) enabling the flow of

current through the warning device (100) if a signal
which lies outside a specific value range is present at

a control input (132) of the first switching means
(130), self-locking means (195) being provided which

make available a signal independently of the control
unit (140) at the control input (132) of the first

switching means, the control unit (140) driving a
second switching means (160) in such a way that,

outside the fault state, a signal which lies inside the
specific value range is present at the control input

(132) of the first switching means (130), in that a
low-side switch is used as first switching means (130),

characterized in that the control unit (140) checks
whether a fault state is present and the device

displays the fault state, and in that the first
switching means (130) includes a safety function which

is active only if a signal which exceeds the specific
value is present at its control input (132).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that an N-channel enhancement MOSFET which enables the

flow of current if the voltage present at its gate
(132) exceeds a specific value is used as first

switching means (130). 
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first switching means

includes a short-circuit protection as safety function
and is implemented as an integrated circuit.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the short-circuit

protection interrupts the flow of current when a short-circuit
is detected.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least one resistor

which is connected between the warning device and
control input of the first switching means, or at least

one resistor which is connected between the supply
voltage and control input of the first switching means

serves as self-locking means.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first switching means

and/or the self-locking means are arranged in the
vicinity of the warning device.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fault state is

present if a fault occurs in the region of the control
uni
t, in particular of an ABS control unit.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the control input is

continuously supplied, via the self-locking means, with
a signal which exceeds the specific value, and in that,

in normal operation, the control unit drives the second
switching means in such a way that the latter connects

the control input to earth.
