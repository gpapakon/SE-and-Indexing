<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for generating digital waveforms for use in the 
testing of logic gates comprises a calculator (1) operable to 

generate a sucession of output values which consist of 
solutions to a stored generator equation. The said output 

values are applied to the gate array (6) under test and may be 
altered according to the form of the generator equation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for generating
digital waveforms for use in the testing of logic gates.In order to test logic gates, there is a requirement for
sending uniquely coded bit streams along a set of wires which
are connected to the gates under test.A conventional approach for synchronous testing of an
array of gates includes the following steps;
(i) partition the requirement into clock periods,(ii) define the most significant bit (MSB) and the least
significant bit (LSB) for the wires,(iii)tabulate logic states in columns for the required
bit-streams and calculate a decimal word for each
column,(iv) read out the decimal words one by one into the gate
array.This invention performs the above functions and further
provides a novel approach for generating and controlling the
bit-streams.According to this invention as set forth in the claims, there is provided apparatus
for generating digital waveforms for testing an array of logic
gates, said apparatus including calculator means operable to
receive a set of input values which form an argument of a
generator equation and to create a sequence of digital output
values each comprising the calculated result of the generator
equation, and means for applying said digital output values to
the array of logic gates under test. The means for applying the digital output values to the
logic gate array could be simply a set of wires, buffered if
necessary.The set of input values could be stored in a memory and
clocked into the calculator means at a desired rate.
Alternatively, the set of input values could be fed into the
calculator means from an on-the-fly buffer / processor.One or more generator equations could be stored in a
second memory to which the calculator means has access.
Generation of waveforms based on the concept of calculating
the results of an generator equation are described in detail
in our co-pending European Patent Application; EP-A-509,713.
Therein, certain generator equations are termed "Portmanteau
functions", one example being, the inverse of a trigonometric
function ie arc.cos(sin P). Herein, a "Portmanteau Function"
can be any generator equation.Some embodiments of the invention will now be described,
by way of example only, with reference to the drawings in
which:
Figure 1 illustrates, in block diagram form, apparatus
for testing logic gates in accordance with the invention, and;Figures 2A and 2B show logic states relating to the
outputs of the apparatus of Figure 1;In Figure 1, a calculator 1 has inputs from a memory 2
