<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical conveyor system (1) is provided with an exposed flexible membrane surface (21) for use in clean room environments. The conveyor system (1) may be one of varied subassemblies which transfer articles (2) on the conveyor by small orbital motions. The exposed flexible sheath (21) is preferably a membrane which is permeable to air. The system may provide for air flow (80, 90) through the membrane to ensure a clean environment. A preferred flexible membrane is expanded polytetrafluoroethyelene (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mechanical conveyor system 
equipped with an exposed flexible sheath surface for use in clean 
room environments. The conveyor system may be one of varied 
subassemblies which transfer articles on the conveyor by small 
orbital motions. The exposed flexible sheath is preferably a 
membrane permeable to air. The system may provide for airflow 
through the membrane to ensure a clean environment. A preferred 
flexible membrane is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. The preamble of claim 1 is based on DE-A-38 29 305. Means of conveying articles in clean rooms include ordinary 
conveyor belts with some of the moving parts shielded or covered 
with exhaust hoods to draw particles away, and expensive 
specialized robotic arms using exotic nonparticulating surfaces on 
moving parts that are subject to friction. There are many types of conveyors. Roller conveyors use 
rotating wheels or cylinders to support the conveyed articles. 
These conveyors are typically stationary. A conveyor belt uses a 
flat or trough shaped endless belt cycling around pulleys at either 
end. Drag conveyors use a stationary tray or trough along which 
pushers or bars travel, dragging conveyed articles with them. 
Vibratory conveyors rapidly move upward and forward, then downward 
and backward, such that conveyed articles are thrown toward the 
discharge end in many tiny steps. Variations of these types use 
gravity or applied mechanical power in different ways. A walking beam conveyor typically comprises two subassemblies 
of long bars or beams aligned parallel to the direction of 
conveyance. One subassembly, called the stationary beam, 
comprising at least two bars of equal length and height spaced side  
 
by side, supports the conveyed articles most of the time. A second 
subsassembly, called the walking beam, also comprising at least two 
bars of equal length and height spaced side by side relatively more 
closely than those of the stationary beam, is positioned in between 
the bars of the stationary beam. This second subassembly moves up 
between the bars of the stationary beam, lifting the conveyed 
article slightly above the stationary beam. The second subassembly 
then moves forward, advancing the article, and then lowers it again 
to the stationary beam. The second subassembly then moves down 
below the level of the stationary beam, where it is not touching 
the conveyed article, and moves back to its original starting 
position. The conveyed article advances along the conveyor in 
several steps,
