<ABSTRACT>
A ballasted amine is incorporated in a silver 
halide photographic element which contains a 2,4-disulfonamidophenol 

which functions as a scavenger for 
oxidized developing agent. The 2,4-disulfonamidophenol 

serves to avoid color contamination while the ballasted 
amine serves to reduce dye stain.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to 
photography and in particular to color photographic 
elements comprising radiation-sensitive silver halide 
emulsion layers. More specifically, this invention 
relates to an improvement in color photographic 
elements which contain certain scavengers which prevent 
oxidized developing agent generated in one layer from 
diffusing into another layer. Color images are customarily obtained in the 
photographic art by reaction between the oxidation 
product of a silver halide color developing agent 
(i.e., oxidized aromatic primary amino developing 
agent) and a dye-forming compound known as a coupler. 
The reaction between coupler and oxidized color 
developing agent results in coupling of the oxidized 
color developing agent at a reactive site on the 
coupler, known as the coupling position, and yields a 
dye. The dyes typically produced by coupling are 
indoaniline, azomethine, indamine, or indophenol dyes, 
depending upon the chemical composition of the coupler 
and the developing agent. The subtractive process of 
color image formation is ordinarily employed in 
multicolor photographic elements and the dyes produced 
by coupling are usually cyan, magenta or yellow dyes 
which are formed in or adjacent to silver halide 
emulsion layers sensitive to radiation absorbed by the 
image dye, i.e., silver halide emulsion layers 
sensitive to the red, green or blue regions of the 
spectrum. In order to prevent oxidized developing agent 
generated in one image-forming layer of a color  
 
photographic element from diffusing into another layer, 
it is common to incorporate in the element a compound, 
referred to as a "scavenger", which reacts with the 
oxidized developing agent without forming a colored 
reaction product. Because of their high degree of 
reactivity and excellent oxidative stability, 2,4-disulfonamidophenols 
are frequently employed as 
scavengers. The use of 2,4-disulfonamidophenols, or 
alkali labile precursors thereof, as scavengers for 
oxidized developing agent is disclosed, for example, in 
Ross et al U.S. Patent No. 4,447,523, issued May 8, 
1984. One deficiency associated with the use of 
2,4-disulfonamidophenols as scavengers in photographic 
systems is that they can cause increased sensitizing 
dye stain. Sensitizing dyes are ordinarily intended to 
be washed out or otherwise removed from the 
photographic element during processing. However, in 
many cases, sensitizing dye is not fully removed but is 
retained in the photographic element after
