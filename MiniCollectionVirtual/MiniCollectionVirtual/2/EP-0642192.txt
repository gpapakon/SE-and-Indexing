<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an array antenna according
to the preamble of claim 1.Nowadays, array antennas are used to a great extent as
antennas for radio links, radar stations and in other
connections when it is desired to direct the transmitted
radiation energy in a certain direction. These array
antennas are built from a number of radiating elements
which, by interaction, provide the antenna with the desired
properties. By way of example, an array antenna can be
composed of a number of waveguide slot antennas, that is
antennas which consist of waveguides provided with slots in
one of the waveguide walls. The slots act as radiating
elements and are normally located along the longitudinal
direction of the waveguide and at a mutual distance
approximately equal to one or one half waveguide wavelength.
In the latter case, the slots are often alternately
displaced with respect to the centre line of the waveguide.An array antenna composed of several waveguides will
constitute a large, plane surface. If such an antenna is
illuminated with radiation from another antenna, the
incident radiation will be reflected. Normally the radiation
is reflected away from the illuminating antenna and
is then unimportant, but under certain conditions a heavy
re-radiation (in the following named reflexion) may appear
in a direction which is opposite to that of the incident
radiation. This occurs of course when the radiation incides 
perpendicular to the antenna surface, as well as in certain
other directions.Reflexion may primarily occur when the frequency of the
incident radiation is within the same frequency range as
that for which the array antenna is intended. When the
direction of the incident radiation is such that its
electrical field vector is primarily located in the same
plane as the electrical field vector of the radiating
elements (the slots), the radiating elements will be
excited and thereby emit radiation. When the phase difference
between the radiation from two slots corresponds to
one full wavelength, the radiation is merged and a plane
wave front is generated which propagates in a specific
direction.It can be shown, that for the most commonly existing
dimensions of the waveguides and at a direction of incidence
of approximately 45° from the main direction of the
antenna, a wave front which propagates in the opposite
direction will be generated. Thus, the radiation will be
reflected back towards the source of radiation. In certain
applications this is not wanted, one of several reasons
being that
