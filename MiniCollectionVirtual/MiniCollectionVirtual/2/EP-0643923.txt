<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating meat or fish which comprises 
coating the meat or fish with a substantially dry 

particulate mixture comprising from 5 to 50% by weight 
of a heat set protein and from 95 to 50% by weight of an 

unmodified starch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of meat 
or fish, more particularly to a process of coating meat 
or fish with an agent which enhances moisture retention 
within the food during preparation of the food for 
immediate or subsequent consumption and during storage. The process of this invention is suitable for chilled or 
frozen meat or fish products which are later consumed 
for consumption, for example, stir-fry dishes and 
steaks. Of particular recent interest in convenience food 
preparation is a method known as sous vide, which is 
employed for providing microbiologically stable vacuum 
packed foods, including meats, and particularly fish, 
which require only heating to a desirable temperature 
for consumption. In this process, a raw meat is placed 
in a pouch, preferably transparent, which then is vacuum 
sealed. The pouch containing the meat is heated, 
generally by placing it in a water bath which has a 
temperature of from about 60°C to about 75°C until the 
meat reaches an internal core temperature ("ICT") which 
is considered sufficient to at least make the meat 
microbiologically stable for storage, i.e. , generally 
60°C and above. Then, the meat is held at the stated 
temperature for about 15 mins to about 20 mins. The 
pouch and contents then are chilled to a refrigeration 
temperature, i.e., generally about 4°C to about 8°C, 
and/or frozen. However, when preparing products such as meat in the 
sous vide manner, although the objective of the process 
is to provide a convenience product having the 
appearance and characteristics of a fresh product when 
purchased and prepared for consumption, that objective 
has not been able to be realized effectively. Problems  
 
are particularly acute for fish because it loses fluids 
readily and becomes not only dry, fibrous and tough upon 
consumption, but also the product is not aesthetically 
pleasing in the package because of fluids which exude 
from the products. One means employed to attempt to obtain a final 
sous-vide product containing sufficient fluids and 
moistness has been to marinate the raw meat prior to 
vacuum packing it. However, on one hand, the marination 
tends to impart a texture to the meat which is not 
characteristic of conventionally cooked fresh meat, and 
on another hand, because the marination fluids tend to 
separate from the solids, the solids tend to form into a 
granular type consistency during the ICT cooking and 
during preparation for consumption. Additionally, in the sous vide process, and for that 
matt

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating meat or fish which comprises 
coating the meat or fish with a substantially dry 

particulate mixture comprising from 5 to 50% by weight 
of an uncoagulated heat set protein and from 95 to 50% by weight of an 

unmodified ungelatinised starch each weight being based upon the 
weight of the mixture wherein the amount of water in the 

mixture is less than 10%. 
A method according to claim 1 wherin the ratio of the 
heat set protein to the starch is from 2:10 to 6:10. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the heat set 
protein is an egg white protein or egg albumen. 
A method according to claim 1 wherin the starch is a 
potato starch. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the heat set 
protein is employed in an amount of from 15 to 35% by 

weight based on the weight of the dry mixture. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the unmodified 
starch is employed in an amount of from 60 to 85% by 

weight based on the weight of the dry mixture. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the amount of 
dry particulate mixture applied to the meat or fish is 

from 1 to 10% by weight based on the weight of the meat 
or fish. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein after coating 
the meat or fish, the coated meat or fish is cooked. 
A method according to claim 8 wherein the cooked, 
coated meat or fish is placed in a plastics pouch which  

 
is sealed under vacuum, heated to an ICT of from 63°C to 

65°C for a period of from 15 to 18 minutes, after which 
the pouch is chilled or deep frozen. 
A meat or fish product having an exterior surface 
coated with a substantially dry particulate mixture 

comprising from 5 to 50% by weight of an uncoagulated heat set protein 
and from 95 to 50% by weight of an unmodified ungelatinised starch 

each weight being based upon the weight of the mixture wherein 
the amount of water in the mixture is less than 10%.
