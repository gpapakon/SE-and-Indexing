<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for testing the operability of a system for detecting heat-radiating, e.g. glowing or red-hot, particles carried in a particle stream, the device having at least two detectors spaced a certain distance apart and located on the wall of a tube through which the particle stream flows. Each detector is located in a chamber separated from the particle stream by a wall plate which is transparent to at least heat radiation. Associated with each detector is a transmitter which is also located in the chamber. Each transmitter and detector is connected to a central switching point.

Device for testing the operability of a system 
for detecting particles which are carried in a particle 

stream (2), and which emit thermal radiation, for 
example incandescent or glowing particles, having at 

least two detectors (5, 5', 5'', 5''') which are spatially 
separated from one another and which are disposed at the 

periphery of a tube (3) through which the particle stream 
(2) flows, each detector (5, 5', 5'', 5''') being disposed 

in a chamber (6, 6') screened off against the particle 
stream (2) by a cover plate (8, 8') which is transmissive 

at least for the thermal radiation, characterized in that 
an emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') which is likewise disposed in 

the chamber (6, 6') is associated with each detector (5, 
5', 5'', 5'''), and in that each emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') and 

detector (5, 5', 5'', 5''') are connected to a central 
switching station. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') is designed as a light 

source operating, for example, in the infrared or visible 
range, the sensitivity range of the detector (5, 5', 5'', 

5''') preferably being matched to the wavelength of the 
light being emitted by the light source. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a plurality of chambers (6, 6') accommodating in 

each instance emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') and detector (5, 
5', 5'', 5''') are disposed so as to be distributed over the 

length of the tube (3) carrying the particle stream (2), 
in each instance two chambers (6, 6') being situated 

opposite one another. 
Process for testing the operability of a system  
 

according to Claim 1, characterized in that the test 
signal emitted by the emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') situated in 

a chamber (6, 6') is received by the detector (5, 5', 5'', 
5''') disposed in at least one other, preferably the 

opposite, chamber (6, 6') and is further conducted to a 
central switching station, which carries out a comparison 

of the received signal or signals with the test signal. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the emission power of each emitter (7, 7', 7'', 7''') 

is variable. 
Process according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that a plurality of test runs are carried out in 

succession with differing intensity.
