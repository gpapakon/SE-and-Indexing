<ABSTRACT>
The vertical sloping leaf springs (3) supporting the stator are fastened on horizontal foot plates (10). Arranged beneath the foot plates (10) is in each case one elongate bearing element (14) which lies on a foundation plate. The foot plates (10) are, moreover, connected to the foundation plates such that radial forces above a certain magnitude are no longer transmitted to the foundation. In order to absorb these forces, the invention provides connecting elements (9) which connect the foot plates to one another and absorb horizontal forces. This structure makes it possible for the sloping leaf springs to tilt elastically about a tilting axis (K) which is located perpendicularly with respect to the spring plane (5). This reduces, in the case of the given natural frequency, the loading of the spring material. The tensile forces, produced by clamping, onto the foundation also become smaller. The connecting elements (9) and the abovedescribed limitation of the forces between the foot plates and the foundation, moreover, have the effect that large radial forces are not transmitted to the foundation, this preventing damage to the foundation in the event of disruption.
