<ABSTRACT>
The line signal deterioration removing system 
comprises an automatic equalising means (10) for removing 

intersymbol interference from signal point information on 
the complex plane of a signal received on the transmission 

line; a carrier automatic phase control means (120) for 
removing phase error and frequency offset included in the 

equalised output of the automatic equalising means (10); a 
prediction filter means (14) for removing phase jitter 

included in an output of the carrier automatic phase 
control means (120); and a decision means (16) for deciding 

transmitted signal points based on an output of the 
prediction filter means (14) and for outputting a decision 

error corresponding to the difference between a decided 
signal point and received signal point. The prediction 

filter means (14) comprises a first modulation means (140a) 
for modulating the received point input with a 

predetermined frequency (fc) after delaying such input for 
a required number of symbols for normalisation; a second 

modulation means (140c) for modulating the decision error 
with the frequency (fc) after normalisation; and a 

demodulation means (140b) for recovering a prediction 
filter output by demodulation with the frequency (fc); 

whereby the frequency operation region of the prediction 
filter means (14) is shifted by the modulation frequency 

(fc). Thus, the prediction filter which was previously 

inferior in tracking at lower frequencies, can be made to 
follow low-frequency jitter satisfactorily, by operating 

the filter in a shifted frequency operation region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for detecting
and cancelling transmission line deterioration factors and
particularly to a line signal deterioration removing
system, to be employed for a data modem, which effectively
removes a phase jitter factor.Recently, there has been increasing use of data
transmission utilising telephone lines having transmission
bands in the voice frequency range. In such a data
transmission system, a so-called modem, usually affording
a modulator for sending and a demodulator for receiving, is
provided, and various line deterioration factors generated
in a line between modems provided at the sending side and
the receiving side are removed by such modems.Particularly with a recent modulation system giving an
improved data transmission rate through the introduction of
a multiphase modulation system, it is desired to equalise,
with high accuracy, various kinds of signal deterioration
which occur in relation to the phases of the signals to be
transmitted. These include intersymbol interference
occurring on the line, frequency offset generated due to
differences of carrier frequencies for modulation and
demodulation, and phase jitter generated due to fluctuation
of power source voltage.In a case in which a telephone line with a frequency
range 0.3 to 3.4 Khz is used, it is known that the
following typical deterioration factors must be
considered:-
(1) intersymbol interference,(2) phase error and frequency offset,(3) phase jitter.For the equalisation of characteristics which are
considered as deterioration factors, signal deterioration
has been compensated at the receiving side with a structure
as shown in Fig. 11.Fig. 11 is a structural diagram of an algorithm of 
operations within a modem on the receiving side, in
accordance with the prior art. Such an algorithm is
executed by programs using digital signal processing LSIs
and microprocessors.In Fig. 11, 10 is an automatic equaliser (AEQ) which is,
for example, formed by a transversal filter. A base band
signal after demodulation or a pass band signal before
demodulation, received from the transmission line, is input
to the automatic equaliser as coordinate data (vector data)
corresponding to signal points in a complex plane. An
equalised output is provided by removing the intersymbol
interference element (the line deterioration factor 1
mentioned above) from such an input signal.In the stage following equaliser 10, a carrier phase
controller, comprising a carrier automatic phase control
circuit (CAPC) 12 and a hard decision
