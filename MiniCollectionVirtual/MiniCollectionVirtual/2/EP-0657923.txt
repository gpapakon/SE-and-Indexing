<ABSTRACT>
A method of making integrated circuit chip to substrate 
connections first deposits a blanket layer of CrCu over a 

completed wafer which has terminal vias etched in the final 
insulator. Then PbSn solder is electrolytically plated through 

a photoresist mask. After the plating is done, the resist is 
removed and the Cu is etched using the solder dot as a mask, and 

then the solder dots are melted to form spheroid or ball shapes. 
Next, a positive photoresist is applied in a manner that 

distributes the photoresist around the base of the solder balls. 
The solder balls are then used as a self-aligned exposure mask. 

Since the photoresist under the balls is not exposed, each ball 
has a concentric layer of resist at the base after exposure and 

development. This concentric layer of resist protects the Cu/PbSn 
interface and is used as the mask for etching excess Cr. The 

resist is then removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method of 
making integrated circuit (IC) chips to substrates and, more 
particularly, to a process which provides a protecting resist of 
a ball limiting metal (BLM) during etch process resulting in the 
formation of an ideal contact structure. In recent years, several methods of making integrated 
circuit chip to substrate connections have been developed. A 
well-known technique for connecting the chip to a carrier is the 
Controlled Collapse Chip Connection (C-4) technique developed by 
the International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) which allows a 
plurality of input/output (I/O) terminals to be close together. 
Another well-known technique for packaging chips or carriers is 
the Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) technique. TAB packaging 
involves the use of a web of material to carry electrically 
conductive leads which provide connections between the chip and 
the outside world. Another method is to use a molybdenum mask 
containing holes in the appropriate locations and to evaporate 
successive layers of chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and gold (Au) and 
a lead/tin (PbSn) solder through the mask onto the wafer. The conventional methods of forming the metal bumps on a 
semiconductor substrate has the shortcoming that the bonding 
force of the bumps on the substrate is not sufficient, because 
the etchant used in the process etches the electrode pads. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,293,637 to Hatada et al. discloses an improvement 
in which strong metal bumps are made, undesirable etching of 
external lead wires of the semiconductor device is avoided, and 
metal bumps of substantially uniform height even on different 
kinds of regions are made.  U.S. Patent No. 4,273,859 to Mones et al. provides an 
improved method of forming raised input/output terminals, or I/O 
bumps, on the top surface of integrated circuits (IC) chips while 
the IC chips are still integral; i.e., IC elements of a single 
crystal silicon wafer. U.S. Patent No. 5,010,389 to Gansauge et al. relates to the 
packaging of electronic components on a carrier, preferably on 
a silicon carrier, and particularly to an IC chip packaging 
structure which comprises on a substrate different terminals for 
different packaging or connection techniques. Japanese Application Nos. 63-18665 and 57-226135 show 
semiconductor devices in which barrier metals are "stepped" to 
strengthen contact ball connection. U.S. Patent No. 4,861,425 to Greer et al. shows one of the 
lift-off processes in the art of semiconductor terminal 
me
