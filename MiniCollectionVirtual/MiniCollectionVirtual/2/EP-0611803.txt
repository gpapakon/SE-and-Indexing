<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymer mixtures of two different polymer components having LCST behaviour for use in industrial processes which require temperature-controlled light transparency, where the polymer mixtures P are built up from poly- alpha -methylstyrene as polymer component P1 and polyvinyl methyl ether as polymer component P2 in a weight ratio of from 98 : 2 to 2 : 98.

<CLAIMS>
Polymer mixtures comprising two different polymer 
components with LCST behaviour for use in technical 

processes which require a temperature-controlled light 
transmissivity, characterised in that the polymer mixtures P 

are synthesised from poly-α-methylstyrene as polymer 
component P1 and polyvinyl methyl ether as polymer component 

P2 in a weight ratio of 98 : 2 to 2 : 98. 
Polymer mixtures P according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the polymer components P1 and P2 are in a weight 

ratio of 90 : 10 to 10 : 90. 
Polymer mixtures P according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the molecular weight of polymer 

component P1 is in the range of 600 to 10,000 Daltons. 
Polymer mixtures P according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the molecular weight of polymer component P1 is in 

the range of 600 to 2,000 Daltons. 
Polymer mixtures P according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that they additionally comprise a low-molecular 

weight component W in amounts of 0.1 to 1,000 
parts by weight. 
Polymer mixtures P according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that their separation temperature is in the 

range of 60 - 100°C.
