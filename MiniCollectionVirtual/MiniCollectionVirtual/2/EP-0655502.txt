<ABSTRACT>
There are given disclosures on a method of measuring an antimicrosormal 
antibody, a gene engineering process for preparing 

human thyroid peroxidase to be used for the measurement as well 
as an expression of the human thyroid peroxidase. The antimicrosormal 

antibody is measured by checking and investigating 
a reactivity of the human thyroid peroxidase produced by gene engineering 

techniques with a human serum. A natural membrane bound 
type human thyroid peroxidase or a secretion type human thyroid 

peroxidase is produced. The natural membrane bound type human 
peroxidase is produced on cell membrane of an cultivated animal 

cell or 
Escherichia
coli
 transformed with an expression vector 
having therein recombinant DNAs encoding the human thyroid gene 

and dihydrofolate reductase gene. The secretion type human 
thyroid peroxidase is produced in a supernatant of cultivated 

medium of animal cell transformed with an expression vector 
having therein recombinant DNAs encoding the human thyroid gene 

but with no membrane region thereof and dihydrofolate reductase 
gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of measuring an antimicrosormal 
antibody, a gene engineering process for the 
production of human thyroid peroxidase (hereinafter referred to 
as "hTPO") to be used for the measurement. Most of all patients with a thyroid disease has in their 
serum autoantibodies capable of reacting with thyroglobulin, 
microsormal antigen and thyrotrophic hormone receptor. Among the 
autoantibodies, antimicrosormal antibody is quite useful for a 
diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid diseases, and it has been found 
that a value of the antibody shows a good interrelation with 
lymphatic infiltration in thyroid. Further, it has been reported that the value increases in 
case of a patient with myasthenia grarsis, lupoid hepatitis, insulin 
dependent infantile diabetes and the like. Therefore, a measurement of the antimicrosormal antibody 
can be utilized for a clinical diagnosis on said diseases. Hitherto, a measurement of the antimicrosormal antibody has 
been carried out with various methods and, in general, following 
methods have been widely accepted, as testing methods. 
a) Complement fixation test, b) Fluorescent antibody test, c) Passive hemagglutination test, d) Precipitation test, and e) E. I. A. (Enzyme Immuno Assay). Since the nature of microsormal antigen has not sufficiently 
been elucidated, each of the above conventional methods 
uses, as an antigen, human thyroid tissue perse or a microsormal  
 
fraction obtained by somewhat purifying the tissue, so that 
it has substantial problems as in following matters. 
1) Matter on differences due to origin of thyroid tissue; 2) Matters on humanity due to that the human tissue is 
employed as the reagent or raw material thereof and on 
availability of the tissue; and 3) Generation of non-specific reaction due to use of the 
human tissue or its fraction, which causes instability in 
sensitivity. Recently, it has been so estimated that hTPO shall be nature 
of the antigen to autoantibodies produced in large amount in 
blood by the patient with thyroid disease. Further, a cloning on 
cDNA of hTPO has been carried out to make apparent its nucleotide 
sequence (Number of nucreotides : 3048, Molecular weight : 
107000) and a primary structure of amino acids therefor (Shioko 
KIMURA etal, "Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA", Vol. 84, pages 5555 - 
5559, Aug. 1987, Biochemistry). An object of the invention is to provide a method of measuring 
antimicrosormal antibodies, which is excellent in reaction 
specificity to show high sensitivity in
