<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an encapsulated active substrate comprising a bleach and/or a bleach activator releasably encapsulated in a coating of at least one metal salt of an inorganic acid, said salt being soluble in an aqueous medium such that upon contacting the encapsulated substrate with the aqueous medium, the active substrate is released into said aqueous medium, characterized in that the substrate has a preliminary coating of an alkali metal carbonate or a bicarbonate and a final encapsulating coating of a metal salt of an inorganic acid. The coating technique controls the activity of the bleach or bleach activator and minimises dye damage or pinholing of the fabrics washed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to active substrates such as 
bleach activators releasably encapsulated in a coating thereon and 
methods of applying the same. It is well known to use bleach activators in detergent 
formulations. One of the important aspects of such formulations is 
that they should be capable of being stored over a significantly long 
period both by the producers of such formulations, the retailers of 
the product and by the end user, eg the housewife, who usually buys 
in bulk and likes to use it in small aliquots for washing as and when 
necessary. However, it is also well recognised that the components 
of such formulations, especially the bleaches and bleach activators, 
may have an unacceptably short storage life due to their tendency to 
undergo undesirable physical or chemical changes, thereby resulting 
in deterioration of the formulation which may manifest itself as, eg 
loss of activity, discolouration, loss of attrition resistance. 
hygroscopicity and hence caking by absorption of moisture, staining 
the clothes washed or as malodour. It has been found that bleaches 
and bleach activators in particular are prone to such undesirable 
changes. It is known to apply protective barrier coatings on relatively 
unstable compounds to improve their storage stability. Catalysts 
used in chemical reactions are a well known example where barrier 
coatings have been applied. In the case of active substrates such as 
bleaches and bleach activators there is the added problem that any 
coating applied should be such that:  
 
a. the active species is readily released when in 
contact with the aqueous wash system, especially 
at low temperatures; b. it mitigates any problems of dye damage or 
staining by the use of a bleach or bleach 
activator; c. the barrier coating itself should not interfere 
with the other components in the formulation; d. the barrier coating does not adversely affect the 
wash or the clothes being washed in terms of 
causing dye damage or staining, and e. should be user friendly and friendly towards the 
environment when discarded with the wash water. Of these, (a.) above is fairly critical in determining whether 
or not a particular barrier coating is suitable. Our published EP-A-0482807 
describes barrier coatings for bleach activators of this 
type with a metal salt of an inorganic acid which is soluble in the 
aqueous wash system. The reason for using a barrier coating with 
bleach activators is to minimise the pinholing or dye damage caused 
by such very active

<CLAIMS>
An encapsulated active substrate comprising a bleach, a bleach 
activator or mixtures thereof releasably encapsulated in a coating 

of at least one metal salt of an inorganic acid, said salt being 
soluble in an aqueous medium such that upon contacting the 

encapsulated substrate with the aqueous medium, the active substrate 
is released into said medium, characterised in that the substrate has 

a preliminary coating of an alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal 
bicarbonate and a final encapsulating coating of a metal salt of an 

inorganic acid. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to Claim 1 wherein 
the bleach so encapsulated is a peroxygenated compound selected from 

the group consisting of percarbonates, perpyrophosphates, 
pertripolyphosphates, perborates, percarboxylates, permonosulphates 

and peroxyphthalates. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to Claim 1 wherein 
the bleach activator so encapsulated is either a cyclic anhydride of 

formula (I) or a lactone of formula (II): 

  
 

where Q is at least a divalent organic grouping such that Q and N 
together with the carbonyl and oxygen functions forms one or more cyclic 

structures and in (I) R is H, an alkyl, aryl, halogen, a carboxylic- 
or a carbonyl-containing function, and in (II) R is a C

alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, amino, alkylamino, 

dialkylamino, carboxylic- or a carbonyl-containing function. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the final encapsulating coating is that of a 

metal salt of an inorganic acid, selected from the group consisting of 
a sulphate, a phosphate or a carbonate of a metal from Groups II and III 

of the Periodic Table. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the final encapsulating coating is that of a 

metal salt of an inorganic acid which is a salt of magnesium, zinc or aluminum. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the final encapsulating coating has a  

 
thickness of at least 0.03Âµm. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to any one of the 
preceding Claims wherein the mole ratio of the preliminary coating of

coating of the metal salt of an inorganic acid is no greater than 1:1. 
An encapsulated active substrate according to any one of the

compound soluble in water or in the aqueous medium is applied on the 
substrate having a preliminary coating of an alkali metal carbonate or 

bicarbonate thereon prior to applying the final encapsulating 
coating. 
A method of encapsulating an active substrate comprising a 
bleach and/or a bleach activator in a coating, said method 

comprising: 

a. fluidising a particulate bed of the active substrate in powder 
or granular form and spraying said particles with a spray of a 

solution of an alkali metal carbonate or an alkali metal

b. further fluidising the particles having the preliminary coating 
of an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate thereon in a
