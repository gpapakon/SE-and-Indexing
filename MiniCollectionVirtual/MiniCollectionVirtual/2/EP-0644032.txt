<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an extrusion laminated film and an extrusion
laminated sheet. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a process for producing an extrusion laminated
film and an extrusion laminated sheet with at least one
resin for extrusion laminating selected from
polyethylene resins, polypropylene resins,
ethylene-vinylester copolymer resins and ethylene-(meth)acrylate
copolymer resins, which enables
production of an extrusion laminated film and an extrusion
laminated sheet comprising a plastic substrate having films
firmly adhered thereto without using any chemical primer
agent.Production of extrusion laminated films and sheets
comprising stacked different film materials such as plastic,
paper, metal foils and the like having
properties in addition to
those possessed by a single material, for
example increased strength, gas impermeability, moisture-proofing
property, heat-sealing property, improved
appearance, and the like has been widely conducted and the 
products have primarily been used in a variety of wrappings.
Such laminated films and sheets have been produced by
methods such as dry laminating, wet laminating, hot
laminating, extrusion laminating and coextrusion laminating,
selected depending upon the characteristics to be
utilized. Wrapping materials comprising a substrate having
a heat-seal layer have been produced by the popularly used
extrusion laminating method to form the heat-seal layer on
the substrate which is advantageous in cost. Materials to
be generally used for the heat-seal layer include polyolefin
resins such as polyethylenes, polypropylenes, and ethylene
copolymers, and ionomers. However, polyolefin resins have
been used in large qualities from an economic standpoint.These resins are generally melt-extruded and
laminated onto the adhesive surface of a substrate which has
been precoated with a chemical primer to promote the
adhesion between the substrate and the resins. The chemical
primers to be used include organic titanate, organic
isocyanate, and polyethyleneimine type adhesives. When
used, these adhesives are usually diluted with an organic
solvent such as toluene, ethyl acetate, methanol or hexane.
However, these methods using chemical primers
have problems such as increased production costs owing to
the expense of chemical primers, the need for complicated
steps of applying and drying the chemical primers, the
scattering of organic solvents harmful to humans into
the air when the chemical primers are dried by
