<ABSTRACT>
Lipid composition for use in food products based on a mixture of oils chosen so as to maintain a balance between all the lipid families capable of offering essential fatty acids in optimal physiological proportions and of regulating the metabolism of these fatty acids. This composition is particularly suitable as domestic oil or as replacement for the lipids in a food product.

Lipidic composition for use as a food, characterized in
that the fatty acids of the triglycerides contain at most

10 % by weight of saturated fatty acids, 50 % to 70 % by
weight of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and 30 to 40 % by

weight of polyunsaturated fatty acids, in that the n-6
fatty acids represent 25 to 35 %, in that the weight ratio

of fatty acids of the n-6 family to those of the n-3 family
is 4.5:1 to 8.5:1 and in that the polyunsaturated fatty

acids contain an effective quantity of acids of the n-3 and
n-6 families with a degree of unsaturation of 3 and over.
Lipidic composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that it contains 45 to 68 % by weight of olive oil,

apricot oil, hybrid sunflower oil and hybrid safflower oil
with a high content of oleic acid or of the oleins of

vegetable oils.
Lipidic composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that it contains 8 to 28 % by weight of sunflower oil,

grapeseed oil, passion flower oil, tomato oil or safflower
oil and 1 to 10 % by weight of an oil capable of providing

an effective quantity of an acid with a degree of
unsaturation of at least 3, chosen from evening primrose

oil, borage oil and blackcurrant seed oil.
Lipidic composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that it contains 2 to 30 % by weight of rapeseed oil,

chia oil, linseed oil, kiwi oil, lucerne oil, rosa mosqueta
oil and 1 to 8 % by weight of oil of marine organisms.
Lipidic composition for use as a food, characterized in

Method for preparing a lipidic composition according to
one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that an antioxidant

is incorporated in the oil rich in mono-unsaturated fatty
acids, in that the different oils are mixed while avoiding

temperatures above 30Â°C and in that the mixture is packaged
under an inert atmosphere.
Food containing fats, characterized in that it is a
lipidic composition according to one of claims 1 to 5.
