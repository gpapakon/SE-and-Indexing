A method of treating viral infections, in particular retroviral infections, 
especially those with the HIV group of viruses, by destroying virus-infected cells 

in the body through administration of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly as 
lithium salts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to treatment of viral infections, particularly 
retroviral infections, and more particularly to treatment of HIV infections and 
AIDS. Viral infections are common and some, such as HIV infections are 
serious and increasing. In spite of much research, existing methods of treating 
viral infections are relatively limited, seeking to interfere with viral replication 
and transmission, and new techniques are urgently required. We have sought 
ways of treating viral infections which aim to destroy the cells which have been 
infected by the virus and thus to destroy the sites at which the viruses multiply. 
This new approach to treating viral infections is particularly appropriate when 
only a limited proportion of the normal cells in any class within the body is 
infected with the virus. This is true of HIV infections where only a small 
proportion of immune system cells (lymphocytes) is infected with the virus at 
any one time. There is substantial evidence, presented for example in EP-A- 0,524,796 
by the present applicants, that patients infected with HIV have reduced levels of 
certain essential fatty acid (EFAs). Treatment of patients having HIV infections 
is proposed therein using the EFA'S alone or in combination, though without 
any disclosed effect of selective destruction of virus infected cells. There are 
twelve naturally occurring EFAs, which are the n-6 and n-3 EFAs as shown in 
Figure 1. In EP-A-0,524,796, particular attention is drawn to GLA, DGLA, 
AA, EPA and DHA. Besides the above EFAs other unsaturated fatty acids 
such as parinaric and columbinic acid also have therapeutic effects.  The applicants have also previously drawn attention to the advantages of 
using the lithium salts when EFAs are being administered intravenously, for 
example in published European Application Nos. 0,585,057 and 0,585,058. 
The lithium salts are relatively water soluble and so can be added to ordinary 
aqueous intravenous (IV) solutions making their administration simple. 
Moreover, because the lithium ion is foreign to the body, at least in substantial 
amounts, it can be used to monitor the rates of infusion easily and quickly. We have now found that unsaturated fatty acids and in particular their 
lithium salts have a unique effect on virally-infected lymphocytes. HIV infected 
lymphocytes are killed at physiologically achievable concentrations, whereas 
uninfected lymphocytes are not. This offers the possibility of eliminating virally 
infected cells from the body, while

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating AIDS and HIV infections by destroying virus-infected 
cells by the administration to a person suffering from such infection of 

an effective amount of one or more unsaturated fatty acids, as such or as 
derivatives particularly as lithium salts, especially the twelve n-6 and n-3 EFAs 

and more especially GLA or DGLA or EPA or DHA. 
A method according to claim 1 in which administration is of 1mg to 100g 
of the or each fatty acid daily, desirably 500mg to 30g and more desirably 1g to 

15g, preferably by the intravenous route. 
A method of treating retroviral infections other than HIV infections by 
the method set out in claim 1. 
A method of treating any viral infection by the method set out in claim 1. 
Use of one or more unsaturated fatty acids, particularly as the lithium 
salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of AIDS and 

HIV infections, or other retroviral infections, or viral infections generally, by 
destruction of virus infected cells in the body. 
Use as in claim 5 of the twelve n-6 and n-3 EFA's and more especially 
GLA or DGLA or EPA or DHA.
