<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a hot water installation, having a hot water accumulator (10) whose contents can be heated up, on the one hand, by an energy-saving heating means, such as a solar collector (12), a heat pump or a condensing boiler, and, on the other hand, by a less energy-saving heating means (24), such as burner for fossil fuels or electric power, provides for the temperature of the water in the hot water accumulator to be measured over time and stored in a computer, for the measured temperatures to be compared with a threshold value (e.g. 60@C) and then, if the measured temperatures have not been above the threshold value in the course of a first period of time (e.g. 1 day) at least once for at least one second, shorter period of time (e.g. a few minutes), for the water in the hot water accumulator to be heated up above the threshold value by the less energy-saving heating means.

A method of controlling legionella in a hot water supply 
installation comprising a hot water tank (10) the content 

of which may be heated on the one hand by an energy-saving 
heating (12), such as a sun collector, a heat pump or a 

condensing value boiler, and on the other hand by an, in 
comparison, less energy-saving heating (24), such as a burner 

for fossil fuel or electrical energy, 
characterized in that 


the temperatures of the water in the hot water tank (10) 
are measured as a function of time, 
the temperatures measured are compared to a threshold 
value (S) (e.g. 60Â°), and 
if the temperatures measured did in the course of a first 
period of time (t
1
) (e.g. one day) not exceed the threshold 
value (S) at least once for at least a second, relatively 

shorter period of time (t
2
) (e.g. a few minutes), the water 
in the hot water tank (10) is heated additionally by means 

of the less energy-saving heating (24) above the threshold 
value (S) to a temperature at which the concentration of 

legionella in the water is lowered. 
The method according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that while heated above the threshold value 

(S) by the less energy-saving heating (24), the water in 
the hot water tank (10) is circulated therein, and possibly 

also in pipes, especially by means of a circulation (38). 
The method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the additional heating is effected 

toward the end of the first period of time (t
1
).  
 
The method according to claim 3,
 

characterized in that the additonal heating is deferred to 
a later beginning if during said heating, with the beginning 

being normal, the energy-saving heating as well would heat 
the water.
