<ABSTRACT>
Heating device comprising a catalytic burner (1) and a thermal receiver (2) consuming at least a part of the heat generated by the catalytic burner, the latter comprising a member (3) for ejection of a flow of combustible gas, a member (4) for admixing primary air to said flow to obtain a mixture to be burned, a chamber (5) for distribution of said mixture, and a structure (6) for catalytic combustion, traversed by the mixture, from its upstream face (6a) in association with the distribution chamber (5) to its downstream face (6b) which discharges the combustion fumes, characterised in that, the radiating front (10) of combustion without flames being situated when operating close to the upstream face of the structure for catalytic combustion, the thermal receiver (2) extends opposite the upstream face (6a) of the catalytic structure (6), over virtually the entire surface of the latter, so as to receive the thermal energy emitted by the radiating front, and said receiver is arranged and constructed to dissipate, on the opposite side (2b) to the upstream face (6a) of the catalytic structure, at least 30% of the thermal energy received by radiation from the radiating front.
