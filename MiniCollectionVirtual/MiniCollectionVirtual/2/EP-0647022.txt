<ABSTRACT>
In a surface acoustic wave-semiconductor composite 
device such as a surface acoustic wave convolver, a piezoelectric 

plate and a semiconductor plate are layered directly or 
with a gap between them. Input electrodes are provided to 

apply a plurality of input signals to the piezoelectric plate 
to excite surface acoustic waves, while an output electrode 

is provided to detect a convolution output signal of a change 
in electric potential of the semiconductor plate at an 

interface of the semiconductor plate with the piezoelectric 
plate. In the layered structure, the semiconductor plate is 

bonded directly to the piezoelectric plate by hydrogen bonds 
between hydroxyl groups or by covalent or ionic bonds of 

oxygen atoms with component atoms of the piezoelectric and 
semiconductor plates. In modified structures, an inorganic 

thin film is applied to one of the piezoelectric and semiconductor 
plates, while the inorganic thin film is bonded 

directly to the other of the two plates. The surface acoustic 
wave-semiconductor composite device can be prepared by using 

direct bonding in an atomic order, with a thickness of a 
direct bonding layer of 20 nm or less. Then, it has a low 

insersion loss and a high efficiency, and it is stable 
thermally and mechanically. Further, its characteristics can 

be reproduced well.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface acoustic 
wave-semiconductor composite device using an interaction 
between surface acoustic waves and surface charges in a 
semiconductor, in particular, to a surface acoustic wave 
convolver. Recently, electric waves for communication are used 
widely according to the development of mobile communication 
technology. Then, shortage of channels, cross talk, eaves-dropping 
and the like become large problems. In order to 
solve these problems, various new communication methods are 
proposed. Code division multiple access (CDMA) method is one 
of potential communication methods which have been studied and 
developed because it can increase a channel number by a factor 
of one digit or more in a same frequency band. The CDMA 
method uses a spread-spectrum communication technology, 
wherein a receive terminal usually includes a convolver for 
a convolution operation of input signals with standard signals 
in order to demodulate signals. Surface acoustic wave convolvers are known which 
combines a surface acoustic wave device and a semiconductor  
 
element, and they are classified into a monolithic type, 
wherein a semiconductor substrate and a piezoelectric plate 
are layered integrally as a one body, and a separation medium 
structure type, wherein a gap is provided between a piezoelectric 
plate and a semiconductor plate opposing each other. A 
surface acoustic wave convolver of monolithic type is 
described, for example, in a paper by B. T. Khuri-Yakub et al. 
(Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 25, 188-190 (1974)), while a 
surface acoustic wave convolver of separation medium type is 
described in a paper by G. S. Kino et al. (Journal of Applied 
Physics, Vol. 44, 5219-5221 (1973)). Fig. 1 shows a representative metal-insulator-semiconductor 
(MIS) structure of a surface acoustic wave 
convolver of monolithic type. A semiconductor plate 21 made 
of silicon or the like and a piezoelectric plate 22 made of 
ZnO, AlN or the like are layered with an insulator layer 26 
provided at an interface between them. The insulator layer 
26 is made of SiO₂ prepared for example with sputtering, and 
the piezoelectric plate 22 is also prepared with sputtering. 
Signal input electrodes 23, 23' of interdigital transducer 
(IDT) and an output electrode 24 are provided on the piezoelectric 
plate 22, while a ground electrode 25 is provided on 
the semiconductor plate 21. Next, an operation of the surface acoustic wave 
convolver is explained. Signals are supplied to the two
