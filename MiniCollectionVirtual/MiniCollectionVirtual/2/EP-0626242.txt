<ABSTRACT>
In a device for manufacturing bricks quantities of 
clay, which are covered with sand, are placed in a mould 

container (3). In order to release the brick from the mould 
container (3) use is made of a mould container of porous 

material (3). Overpressure is created on the outer wall of 
the mould container whereby the brick is released on all 

sides from the mould container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for manufacturing 
bricks from clay, with means for carrying clay from a 
supply holder into mould containers, means for covering 
the clay with sand, means for filling up the mould containers, 
means for transporting and turning over mould 
containers and means for releasing the brick from a mould 
container. Release of a brick from a mould container usually 
takes place with the use of a movable bottom. the drawback 
hereto is that the piece of clay covered with sand 
is driven with a certain force out of the mould container, 
wherein undesired deformations can occur, particularly 
on the side surfaces. The phenomenon can herein occur that portions of 
clay adhere fixedly to the side walls. The invention has for its object to provide an 
improvement for this drawback. This is achieved according 
to the invention in that the means for releasing a brick 
are formed by porous openings in the walls of the mould 
container and means for generating air pressure on the 
outer walls of the mould container. Applying comparatively small releasing forces to the 
brick on all sides results in the brick being released 
from the walls of the mould container without exerting 
excessive forces and without deformations therein occurring 
on the brick. According to a preferred embodiment the mould container 
is manufactured from a sinter plastic material. To 
this end use can be made of the commercially available 
material Fitroplast®. The desired air pressure can be 
obtained by placing the mould container into a space 
connectable to an air pressure line. The invention is elucidated with reference to an 
embodiment.  Fig. 1 shows schematically the manner of moulding a 
brick using mould containers. Fig. 2 shows in perspective view an elucidation of 
the method of release according to the invention. Arranged on a frame 1 is an endless conveyor 2 which 
carries a number of mould containers, for instance 3. The 
mould containers are filled by the throwing device 4 with 
a block of clay 5 covered with sand. Sand-covering takes 
place using the sand-covering device 6. The clay comes 
from a supply holder 7 from which pieces of clay are 
discharged at the outlet 8 thereof using the discharge 
means 9. Placed at another outlet 10 of supply holder 7 
is a topping-up member 11 which tops up the mould containers. 
At the station 12 a carrying plate 13 is placed 
on the mould container. After the turning point 14 of 
conveyor 2 the mould container is released and the brick 
falls with the
