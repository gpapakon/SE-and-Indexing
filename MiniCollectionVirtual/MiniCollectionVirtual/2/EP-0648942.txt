<ABSTRACT>
A linear pneumatic actuator with a reversible-action locking 
device for presetting of the actuator with an active or passive 

brake. The actuator comprises a piston (13) which may 
reciprocate inside a cylinder (10); the linear movement of the 

piston (13) causes rotation of a threaded shaft (20) connected 
to a signal generator (25) which continually supplies the 

relative position of the piston (13). A locking device 
comprises two interconnected piston members (34, 36) which can 

be pneumatically actuated in opposite directions and ducts (46, 
47) supplying pressurised air which can be selected during 

assembly so as to activate the locking device as an active 
brake or passive brake, respectively, in order to block the 

actuator piston (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear pneumatic actuator
and more precisely to an intelligent cylinder provided with a
signal generator and a locking device by means of which it is
possible to obtain precise control and an exact indication of
the stroke of the piston, and in which the locking device is
actuated by the same pressurised fluid so as to obtain a
locking action which can be automatically controlled with
extreme precision from the outside, using a single pneumatic
energy source.In numerous applications, in particular in the construction of
pneumatic axes, devices for handling loads and the like, there
is the need for pneumatic actuators which not only are able to
guarantee precise positioning control, but at the same time can
also ensure rapid and safe blocking of the load, keeping it
firmly in the desired position.Intelligent pneumatic actuators comprising a piston movable in
a reciprocating manner inside a cylinder have already been
proposed, in which the piston is provided with a hollow rod
which emerges from one end of the cylinder and in which a 
threaded shaft is arranged coaxially inside the hollow rod and
engages with a threaded axial hole of the piston so as to
rotate during the relative movement of the piston itself. The
threaded shaft is connected to a signal generator as well as to
a locking device which can be pneumatically actuated so as to
block or release rotation of the actuator's threaded shaft and,
respectively, the linear movement of its piston; counteracting
springs are provided in order to activate normally the device
for effecting locking as a normally active brake or passive
brake.Some examples of linear pneumatic actuators of the intelligent
type, provided with a locking device which can be actuated
pneumatically, can be found for example in GB-A-2,154,282 and
in EP-A-469253. In particular, the document GB-A-2,154,282
describes a linear pneumatic actuator provided with a brake of
the passive type, in which the locking force can be obtained
both pneumatically and by the action of a spring so as to
provide an adequate degree of safety in the event of a drop in
the air pressure in the pneumatic circuit which supplies the
actuator.The document EP-A-469253 in turn describes an intelligent
linear actuator provided with a special locking device
controlled centrifugally. According to one embodiment, the 
pneumatic actuator is provided with a passive brake in which
springs normally press against the locking device so as to
prevent rotation of the threaded shaft. According
