<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the catalytic dehydrogenation of diols having 3 to 10 carbon atoms on a catalyst containing copper and chromium, the diols first being passed over the catalyst in the liquid phase in a 2-stage process and the reaction mixture thus obtained then being passed over the catalyst in the gas phase.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol 
on a catalyst containing copper and chromium, 

characterized in that in a 2-stage process first 
1,4-butanediol is
 passed in the liquid phase over 
the catalyst, and subsequently the reaction mixture 

obtained in this way is passed in the gas phase over 
the catalyst. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the dehydrogenation is carried out under 

atmospheric pressure or slightly elevated pressure. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that in a 2-stage process first 

1,4-butanediol is passed in the liquid phase at 
temperatures from 150 to 220°C over the catalyst, 

and subsequently the reaction mixture obtained in 
this way is passed in the gas phase at temperatures 

from 180 to 240°C over the catalyst.
