<ABSTRACT>
A soil cultivating machine (1), especially 
intended for application in conjunction with a planting 

arrangement, such as a potato planter (2) and the like, which 
machine comprises a frame provided with at least one row of 

soil cultivating members (11) which extends transversely to 
the operational direction of travel of the machine. The 

machine is provided with a soil moving arrangement (40) 
including soil moving members (48) for moving sidewards the 

soil from a soil layer worked by the soil cultivating members 
(11) and for forming ridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soil cultivating
machine, comprising coupling means for connection to the front power lift of
a tractor, especially intended for application in conjunction
with a planting arrangement for coupling to the rear side of
the tractor, such as a potato planter and the like, which
machine comprises a frame provided with at least one row of
soil cultivating members which extends transversely to the
operational direction of travel of the machine, and which
machine comprises at least at its trailing side a supporting
arrangement for suspending the machine from the soil.Such a machine is known from e.g. the laid open
Dutch patent application 8700952. This known machine has the
advantage that secondary soil preparation and planting of
root crops in particular can be done in a cost-effective
single pass of a manned tractor-machine combination. The
known machine has the disadvantage, particularly on
relatively heavy soils, that cultivated soil, after
compression by the roller disposed behind the machine and
particularly by the wheels of the tractor propelling and
driving the machine, cannot be handled easily or at least
advantageously to form ridges.According to the invention, such a problem can be
prevented or at least obviated to a considerable extent
with the characterising features of claim 1.
In this way,
ridges may easily be formed and the worked earth is not
compacted and clodded by either a roller or the tractor
wheels. According to an advantageous embodiment of the
invention, a soil moving member exerts reaction forces
essentially directed horizontally upon the soil to be
displaced. This has the advantage that the soil layers with
their respective moisture contents remain substantially in
place, so that any loss of moisture due to moist soil which
is worked upwards does not occur and no adverse conditions to
germination are produced by mixing the often relatively dry
top layer with underlying soil layers.The machine according to the present invention
particularly aims at working in conjunction with a planting
arrangement, such as a potato planter. Hence, the invention
also comprises a combination of a soil cultivating machine
and a planting machine, such as a potato planter, with the
soil cultivating machine comprising a frame in which there is
provided at least one row of soil cultivating members extending
transversely to the operational direction of travel of
the machine, while the soil cultivating machine is provided
with a soil moving arrangement provided with soil

<CLAIMS>
A soil cultivating machine (1),
comprising coupling means for connection to the front power lift

of a tractor, especially intended for
application in conjunction with a planting arrangement for

coupling to the rear side of the tractor, such as a potato
planter (2) and the like, which machine comprises a frame

provided with at least one row of soil cultivating members
(11) which extends transversely to the operational direction

of travel of the machine, and which machine comprises at
least at its trailing side a supporting arrangement (8) for

suspending the machine from the soil, characterized in that
behind the row of soil cultivating members (11) and in front

of said supporting arrangement (8) the machine is provided
with a soil moving arrangement (40) including soil moving

members (48) for moving sidewards the soil from a soil layer
worked by the soil cultivating members (11) and for forming

ridges (56), and
in that the supporting arrangement (8)

comprises a plurality of supporting elements (13), such as
wheels ,

attached to a carrier (55),
each of which being positioned such that during

operation each is born by the soil in an open furrow (57)
created near a ridge (56).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the said soil moving arrangement is connected to

the frame through a quadrangular construction approximating a parallelogram, and that
there are provided means (39) suitable for limiting in a

downward direction the range of motion in height of the
soil moving arrangement (40) with respect to the frame (7).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 1
or 2, characterized in that a supporting element (13) is made

up of a roller part having an invariable cylindrical
periphery or a roller part having a flexible or elastic

periphery, such as a wheel, with a carrier (55) disposed 
centrally and functioning as shaft of th
e supporting elements
(13).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in any one
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the machine is

a rotary harrow.
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the soil moving

arrangement (40) is coupled to the leading side of the frame
by means of the quadrangular construction (45).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that the upper arm of the quadrangular

construction (45) is adjustable in length.
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the soil moving

arrangement comprises soil working members (49) at which a
lower edge extends virtually horizontally in

sideward and rearward directions.
A combination of machines comprising a soil cultivating
machine as claimed in any one of the preceding

claims and a planting arrangement, such as a potato planter,
the planting arrangement comprising furrow openers operating

in the top soil layer of the said ridges for opening planting
furrows, backfilling members for mainly feeding back soil

moved by the furrow opener, and, behind said backfilling
members, ridging-up members which are mainly operating on the

sides of said strips of soil.
A combination of machines as claimed in claim 8,
or a machine as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
the planting arrangement comprises coupling

means for connection to the rear power lift of a tractor.
