<ABSTRACT>
Normal olefins such as n-butenes can be converted to 
iso olefins such as isobutylene by skeletal isomerization 

over catalysts of boron-beta zeolites having pore sizes of at 
least about 5 Angstroms and containing boron in the framework 

structure thereof. The boron-beta zeoliteS have sufficient 
acidity to catalyze the skeletal isomerization of normal 

olefinsto iso-olefins. The catalysts can be used to produce 
iso-olefins for reaction with alcohols in integrated 

processes to produce alkyl tertiary alkyl ethers such as 
MTBE.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catalysts suitable for use in 
olefin isomerization. In one of its more specific 
aspects, this invention relates to selective isomerization 
of olefins. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
process for the preparation of useful hydrocarbons by 
catalytic conversion of n-butylenes. MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) is an effective 
octane booster. It is made from isobutylene and methanol. 
The present sources of isobutylene for MTBE production are 
mainly from by products of steam, catalytic cracker, and 
propylene oxide production. However, these supplies are 
limited. Other possible sources are by isomerization of 
n-butenes taken from steam or catalytic crackers and by 
dehydrogenation of isobutane taken from field butanes or 
produced by isomerization of n-butane. Olefin isomerization processes can be directed 
towards either skeletal isomerization or double bond 
isomerization. Skeletal isomerization is concerned with 
reorientation of the molecular structure in respect to the 
formation or elimination of side chains. Double bond 
isomerization is concerned with relocation of the double bond 
between carbon atoms while maintaining the backbone of the 
carbon structure. Most isomerization processes give rise 
only to double bond isomerization. The minimum Brönsted Acid strengths, HR, (and equivalents  
 
in H₂SO₄) required for various acid-catalyzed conversions of 
hydrocarbons are indicated in the table below.

For The Acid-Catalyzed Conversions of Hydrocarbons HR Required Reaction Type < + 0.8Cis-trans Isomerization of Olefins 1.2 wt% H₂SO₄ < - 6.6Double-bond Migration 48 wt% H₂SO₄ < - 11.6Skeletal Isomerization  68 wt% H₂SO₄ < - 16.0Cracking of Alkanes  88 wt% H₂SO₄   It is frequently necessary to convert olefins into 
other olefins having a different skeletal arrangement. For 
example, normal butenes are converted into isobutene for, e.g. 
polymerization, alkylation, disproportionation.
 
Similarly, normal amylenes must be converted to isoamylenes 
prior to dehydrogenation to isoprene. While a number of catalytic materials possess some 
activity for such a conversion, not all possess sufficient 
selectivity to be economical. Because the feeds are 
generally the relatively reactive olefins, many catalysts 
cause undesirable side reactions such as polymerization or 
cracking. Consequently, there is a continuing interest in 
the development of new skeletal isomerization catalysts and 
processes for isomerizing
