<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glycerin derivatives useful 
as oily stain dissolving agents, water-soluble organic 
solvents, polar oils, emulsifying agents, lubricating agents, 
moisturizing agents, and intermediates for surfactants and a 
process for producing the same. Alkyl glyceryl ethers have been employed in wide 
fields, such as fixing agents for perfumes (see U.S. Patent 
2,091,162), soap additives (see U.S. Patents 2,157,022 and 
3,350,460), extracting solvents for organic substances (see 
U.S. Patent 2,156,724), moisture retaining agents (see JP-A-3-14505 
and JP-A-3-14506, the term "JP-A" as used herein 
means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application")), components of aqueous ink compositions (see 
JP-A-58-67770), and components of cosmetics (JP-A-52-12109, 
JP-B-57-36260, and JP-B-3-31187 (the term "JP-B" as used 
herein means an "examined published Japanese patent 
application"). As alkyl glyceryl ethers, palmityl glyceryl ether 
(chimyl alcohol) and stearyl glyceryl ether (batyl alcohol) 
which occur in lipid of fishes are conventionally known. 
These naturally occurring alkyl glyceryl ethers are in use in 
broad fields for their excellent performance as an  
 
emulsifying agent. However, since they are solids having a 
high melting point, their applications in compositions 
comprising multiple components, such as cosmetics, are 
restrained. Hence, synthetic glyceryl ethers with various 
alkyl groups have been developed for use in cosmetics and the 
like preparations. For example, lauryl glyceryl ether, β-branched 
alkyl glyceryl ethers (see JP-A-52-12109), a mixture 
of isostearyl glyceryl ethers having a methyl branch in 
nearly the middle of the alkyl chain thereof (see JP-B-57-36260), 
and glyceryl ethers of terpene alcohols (see JP-B-3-31187) 
have been proposed. Known processes for producing these alkyl glyceryl 
ethers include a process comprising hydrolysis by way of 1,3-dioxolane, 
using an alkyl glycidyl ether synthesized from an 
alcohol and epichlorohydrin (see U.S. Patent 3,024,273 and 
JP-B-57-36260) as disclosed in JP-A-56-133281; and a process 
comprising direct hydrolysis as disclosed in JP-A-49-86307. However, the conventional synthetic alkyl glyceryl 
ethers are mixed alkyl ethers, the quality of which is 
difficult to control. Additionally, because the raw 
materials of synthesis are of natural origin, limited in 
availability, so that the products become expensive. Further, the conventional synthetic processes involve 
such problems that a large quantity of
