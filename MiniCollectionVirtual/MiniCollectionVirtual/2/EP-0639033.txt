<ABSTRACT>
In video/audio compression, a video signal is 
separated into luminance and a color difference. The 

color difference is partially subsampled. An interframe 
difference is compression-coded by an encoding unit. At 

that time, particular subsampling information 
corresponding to a designated reproducing rate is 

extracted from subsampling information. The particular 
subsampling information is inserted into compressed video 

data. On the other hand, in video/audio reproduction, 
the color difference of the video, which has partially 

been subsampled, are interpolated by a decoding unit with 
reference to the subsampling information inserted into 

the compressed video data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video/audio
compressing device for recording a compressed video code
and a compressed audio code in a recording medium such as
a CD-ROM and a hard disk and to a video/audio reproducing
device for use in reproduction of a recorded video code
and a recorded audio code.A video/audio reproducing device reads video and
audio codes recorded in a recording medium such as a
CD-ROM and a hard disk and provides a reproduction on a
display or a speaker. The video and the audio codes to
be reproduced by the video/audio reproducing device are
compression-coded and recorded by a video/audio
compressing device.An interframe difference encoding method has been
widely applied to such a conventional video/audio
compressing device of the type described.In the interframe difference encoding method, a
difference value is compression-coded by the use of the
fact that difference values between video frames
concentrate around zero. A video signal is separated 
into a luminance signal and a color difference signal.
Differential values between picture elements of a current
frame and a preceding frame are calculated and
compression-coded. A plurality of frames are compressed
by successively compression-coding the difference values.
Since the difference value between frames may become
large due to a scene change, those frames (key frames)
encoding values of the picture elements, not the
difference values, are inserted at a predetermined
interval.The above-mentioned system requires a device
capable of editing, compressing, and recording a large
amount of video and audio information at a high speed.
Upon reproduction, the audio information is reproduced in
combination with the video information corresponding
thereto. Accordingly, the timing (synchronization) of
reproduction must be adjusted. Particularly, due to the
capacity of the device and the size of the compressed
video code, a video recording/reproducing rate may be
slower than an audio recording/reproducing rate. This
results in collapse of synchronization between the video
and the audio upon reproduction. In this event, an
unnatural impression is given to a watcher of the
display.In order to prevent the collapse of synchronization,
several attempts have been proposed. An example
for establishing the synchronization is disclosed in
JP-A-274480/1986. In this 
system, varied picture elements are detected and clear
videos successively derived from rough videos are
encoded. Thus, high-speed video compression/reproduction
is attained. Another example is
