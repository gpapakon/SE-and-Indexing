<CLAIMS>
Rotary exposure machine (14), containing:

a guide bed (26) ;
a device (15, 16), supported on the guide bed
(26), for the rotable mounting of a round mould

(13);
a drive device (19, 20) for rotating the round
mould (13);
an optical slide (21) which is moved along
guides (22) as the round mould (13) rotates;

and
a laser (27) for exposing a photosensitive
lacquer layer (L) which is present on the

surface of the round mould (13), the laser (27)
being carried along by the optical slide (21),

characterized in that the guides (22) are fitted to the
guide bed (26).
Rotary exposure machine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a laser beam from the laser (27)

is deflected by a deflection mirror (28) from the
originally vertical direction into a horizontal

direction, and is focused radially by an optical system
(29) onto the surface of the round mould (13).
Rotary exposure machine according to Claim 1 or
2, characterized in that the laser (27) is an UV laser

emitting in the range from 200 nm to 400 nm.
Rotary exposure machine according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the optical slide

(21) is moved with the aid of a feed screw (23).
Rotary exposure machine according to Claim 4,
characterized in that a stepping motor (24) is coupled

to the feed screw (23).
Rotary exposure machine according to Claim 5,
characterized in that a torsional-vibration damper (25)

is mounted on the free end of the stepping motor (24).
