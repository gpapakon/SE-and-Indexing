<ABSTRACT>
A composite material comprising a bulky substrate 
of a Y-series 123 metal oxide crystal, and at least one layer 

provided on a surface of the substrate and formed of a 
crystal of a Y-series 123 metal oxide. The substrate may be 

produced by immersing a seed material in a liquid phase which 
comprises components constituting the metal oxide. The 

liquid phase contains a solid phase located at a position 
different from the position at which the seed material 

contacts the liquid phase. The solid phase provides the 
liquid phase with solutes which constitute the Y-series 123 

metal oxide so that the solutes are transported to the 
position at which the seed material and the liquid phase 

contact, thereby permitting the Y-series 123 metal oxide to 
grow on the seed material as primary crystals and to obtain 

the bulky substrate. The layer of a Y-series 123 metal oxide 
may be formed on the substrate by a sputtering method, a 

vacuum deposition method, a laser abrasion method, a CVD 
method or a liquid phase epitaxy method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing
a composite material having a bulky substrate of a
Y-series 123 metal oxide and at least one layer of a Y-series
123 metal oxide provided on a surface of the substrate.A composite metal oxide material is known which
includes a substrate of MgO or SrTiO3 and a thin layer of
a Y-series 123 metal oxide formed on the substrate by a
sputtering method, a vacuum deposition method, a chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) method or a molecular beam epitaxy
method. The known composite material has, however, a
problem that the crystallinity of the thin layer of a
Y-series 123 metal oxide is not good. Thus, the known
composite material is ill-suited for the utilization as a
superconducting device or a superconducting magnetic
shield.The present invention has been made in view of
the foregoing problem of the known composite material.J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 129, Nos. 3/4, pages
786-788 (1993), discloses a method of growing single
crystals of YBa2Cu3O7-x, in which a seed crystal is
contacted with a melt of a mixture of metal oxides at the
bottom of which there is a fine crystalline mixture of
YBa2Cu3O7-x which acts as a solid feed material providing
solutes for the growth of the YBa2Cu3O7-x crystal.WO91/19026 discloses a composite in which a
superconducting perovskite thin film of, for example,
YBa2Cu3O7-x, is formed on a substrate of, for instance,
SrTiO3.In accordance with the present invention, as set out in Claim 1,
there is provided a method of producing a composite material
comprising a bulky substrate of a Y-series 123 metal 
oxide crystal, and a layer provided on a surface of said
substrate and formed of a crystal of a Y-series 123 metal
oxide,
forming said bulky substrate by contacting a
seed material with a liquid phase which contains a melt
of a mixture of metal oxides and in which a solid phase
of a Y-series 211 metal oxide is present at a position
different from the position at which said seed material
and said liquid phase contact, said solid phase providing
said liquid phase with solutes which constitute said
Y-series 123 metal oxide so that said solutes are
transported to the position at which said substrate and
said liquid phase contact, thereby permitting said
Y-series 123 metal oxide to grow on said seed material as
primary crystals and thereby obtaining said bulky
substrate; andforming said layer on said substrate.The term "Y-series 123 metal oxide" used in the
present specification and claims is intended to refer to
a metal oxide having a crystal structure
