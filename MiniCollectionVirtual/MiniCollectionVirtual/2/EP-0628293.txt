<ABSTRACT>
A temporomandibular joint prosthesis comprising a 
cranial prosthesis-part (1) comprising a support surface (3) 

adapted to be seated against bone tissue in the area of and/or 
adjacent to the natural glenoid fossa and/or the the articular 

eminence and a mandibular prosthesis-part (2) adapted to be 
pivotable relative to the cranial prosthesis-part (1) when in 

implanted condition. The mandibular prosthesis-part (1) is 
pivotable about a centre of rotation (6, 16) which is located 

in such a position relative to the support surface (3) of the 
cranial prosthesis-part (1), that in implanted condition the 

centre of rotation (6, 16) is located substantially inferior 
to the centre of the natural mandibular condyle. 
The prosthesis allows a more natural movement of the 
lower jaw without requiring translational movement of 

prosthesis parts adjacent the glenoid fossa and the articular 
eminence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a temporomandibular joint
prosthesis comprising a cranial prosthesis-part comprising a
support surface adapted to be seated against bone tissue in
the area of and/or adjacent to the natural glenoid fossa
and/or the articular eminence and a mandibular prosthesis-part
adapted to be pivotable relative to the cranial prosthesis-part
when in implanted condition.A treatment to counteract dysfunction of natural joints
by causes such as ankylosis, osteoarthrosis, tumour or
developmental disorders is to partially or completely replace
the natural joint by a prosthesis.For the treatment of dysfunctions of the
temporomandibular joint, maxillofacial surgeons generally
prefer a total temporomandibular joint prosthesis as
identified in the preamble to preclude any risk of intrusion
of the artificial condylar head into the midcranial fossa
through the fossa roof or the possibility of condylar head
resorption.The natural temporomandibular joint allows both rotation
and essentially horizontal translation of the mandibular
condyle. Translation is controlled by lateral pterygoid
muscles which are attached to the mandibular condyle. The
function of these muscles is lost when the mandibular condyle
to which they are attached is replaced by a mandibular
prosthesis-part.Examples of such a total temporomandibular joint
prostheses are described in: 'Total Prosthetic Replacement of
Temporomandibular Joint' by C.D. Kiehn et al. in Ann Plast
Surg, 1979; 2:5 and in: 'Temporomandibular Joint Condylar
Prosthesis: A Ten Year Report', by J.N. Kent et al. in Journal
of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery, 1983; 41:245-254. In these and
other known prostheses of this type, the anatomical shape of
the natural articulating surfaces, i.e. the mandibular 
condyle, the articular eminence and the glenoid fossa, is
essentially copied.After implantation of a known prosthesis as discussed
above, the mandible can only rotate about a fixed point at the
side of the prosthesis, which point essentially corresponds
with the centre of the replaced natural mandibular condyle, so
instead of the muscular control of the translatory movement of
the jaw a fixed point of rotation is obtained, precluding
translatory movement of the mandible (lower jaw) at the side
where the prosthesis is implanted.This is uncomfortable for the patient and impairs the
function of the mandible. Furthermore, rotation of the jaw
about a substantially vertical axis is caused when a
translation occurs in the opposite joint. This unnatural
rotation causes exertion of
