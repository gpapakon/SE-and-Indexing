<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a plate-like paving stone, particularly of concrete, with vertically oriented side faces, provision is made, in order to create a stable ground covering with high water permeability, for recesses (3) of substantially trapezoidal cross-section to be formed in two mutually opposite side faces (2) of the paving stone (1), for the mutually approaching boundary faces of the trapezoidal recesses (3) to have a further recess (5) in the central regions, for recesses (7) to be formed centrally in the side faces extending transversely to the side faces of the paving stone, and for bevels (8) to be disposed in the corner regions of neighbouring side faces (2) of the paving stone (1).

Tile-like paving stone, more especially formed from
concrete, having lateral faces which are vertical in the

position of use, wherein substantially trapezoidal recesses
(3), which have a horizontal cross-section in the position

of use, are provided in two oppositely situated lateral
faces (2) of the paving stone (1), wherein the boundary

faces of the trapezoidal recesses (3), which are brought
close to one another, have an additional recess (5) in the

central regions, wherein recesses (7) are provided
centrally in the lateral faces which extend transversely

relative to said lateral faces of the paving stone, and
wherein inclined portions (8) are disposed in the corner

regions of adjacent lateral faces (2) of the paving stone
(1).
Paving stone according to claim 1, characterised in
that the trapezoidal recesses (3) are configured with

identical cross-sectional parameters.
Paving stone according to claim 1, characterised in
that the recesses (5), which are provided in the boundary

faces of the trapezoidal recesses (3), and the recesses
(7), which are disposed centrally in the lateral faces (6),

have substantially a triangular cross-section with
identical cross-sectional parameters.
Paving stone according to claim 1, characterised in
that the two lateral faces (6) have vertical spacer strips

(9) in diagonal portions, and the boundary faces of the
trapezoidal recesses (33) have vertical spacer strips (9)

on both sides adjacent the recesses (5).
Paving stone according to claim 1, characterised in
that the paving stone (1) has inclined portions (10) of

minimal height which extend on its upper side inclinedly 
from above and circumferentially relative to the lateral

faces (2,6).
