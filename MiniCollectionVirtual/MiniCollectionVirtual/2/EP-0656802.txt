<ABSTRACT>
A building set with elements which are interconnectible by means of complementary, primary and secondary coupling means in a one- or two-dimensional periodical modular pattern, and which can be interconnected in at least one direction in fractions of modular steps, because the walls of the building elements perpendicular to said direction have recesses to receive projecting coupling means on other elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a building set with elements which 
are interconnectible by means of projecting, primary coupling 
means arranged in a one- or two-dimensional, periodical 
modular pattern and complementary, secondary coupling 
means, there being box-shaped elements whose secondary 
coupling means in at least one direction have a modular 
distance which is a fraction 1/n, n being an integer 
greater than 1, of the modular distance of the primary 
coupling means. Such building sets are known as toys, but are also used in 
planning boards and the building of text signs, where box-shaped 
elements with e.g. text or symbols are built on an 
elongate building plate by means of the coupling means. Japanese utility model publication No. 45-28658 shows 
building elements where all the lower edges of the side 
walls of the box-shaped elements extend contiguously. Two 
such elements can be built on top of each other so that 
the primary coupling means of the interconnected elements 
are located above and in extension of each other. Furthermore, 
in these known building sets the elements can be 
interconnected to a limited extent in half modular steps 
in said direction, which means that the primary coupling 
means of the interconnected elements are not located above 
each other, but halfway between each other in said direction. 
The limitation is that in the assembly in half modular 
steps the walls of the top element, which extend perpendicularly 
to said direction, will have to be positioned 
precisely at the location where the primary coupling means 
of the lower building element are present. Such interconnection 
is therefore possible only if the walls of the 
upper building element perpendicular to said direction are  
 
present outside the lower building element. This means 
that it is not possible to build a smaller building element 
on top of a larger one in half modular steps. The object of the invention is to provide a building set 
where this is possible. This object is achieved by a building set as defined in 
the characterizing portion of the claim. An element from 
the building set can hereby be built on top of another 
element from the building set, not only in whole modular 
steps, but also in fractions of a modular step in a specific 
direction. This enables interconnection in a larger 
number of mutual positions resulting in greater flexibility. NO-C-96094 shows box-shaped building elements which can be 
interconnected only in full modular steps, i.e. interconnection 
is only possible when

<CLAIMS>
A building set with box-shaped building elements (20, 22, 
22a, 22b) having hollow bottoms at least partially delimited 

by opposed walls (23, 24), said building elements 
being releasably interconnectible by means of two of the 

opposed walls (23, 24) spanning projecting, primary coupling studs 
(11, 11') arranged in a one- or two-dimensional periodical 

modular pattern on other elements (10), said two opposed 
walls (23, 24) having ribs (26) projecting into spaces 

between coupling studs (11, 11'), said ribs (26) being 
arranged periodically and at a modular distance which is a 

fraction 1/n, n being an integer greater than 1, of the 
modular distance of the primary coupling studs (11, 11'), 


characterized
 in that the walls (27, 28) of 
the elements, which are transverse to the walls (23, 24) 

having ribs (26), have recesses in the edges (29) toward 
the bottom, said recesses having a heigth and a width 

which correspond at least to the heigth and width, respectively, 
of the primary coupling studs (11, 11').
