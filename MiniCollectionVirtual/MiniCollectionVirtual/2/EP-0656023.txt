<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to glycidyl ester terminated polyesters according to formula (I), wherein: P represents the polymeric backbone of the polyester; R is H or (C1-C5) alkyl; and n is greater than 2, and wherein said glycidyl ester terminated polyester has an Mn between about 500 and about 10,000, a Tg between about 30  C and about 80  C, and an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) between about 250 and about 5000 grams. The glycidyl ester terminated polyester can be obtained by reaction between a carboxyl groups terminated polyester and an epihaloalkane, preferably epichlorohydrin. These polyesters find application in the preparation of powder coatings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a powder coating composition and to the use of glycidyl ester 
terminated polyesters in the preparation of powder coatings. The glycidyl ester terminated polyester employed in 
the invention is characterized by formula (I): 
 
wherein said formula: 
P represents the polymeric backbone of the polyester; 
which is based on aromatic carboxylic acids; R is H or (C1-C5) alkyl; and n is greater than 2,  
and wherein said glycidyl ester terminated polyester has a Mn 
between 500 and 10,000, a Tg between 30°C 
and 80°C, and an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) between 
250 and 5000 grams. Preferably, R is H, the Mn is between 800 and 
5000, the Tg is between 35°C and 60°C and 
the EEW is between 620 and about 2000. JP-A-52003700 discloses diglycidylesters with 
epoxy groups at ends of straight polyester chain obtained 
from dicarboxylic terminated polyester and epoxyhaloalkane 
followed by dehydrohalogenation of the resulting 
halohydrin. This disclosure relates to two-functional 
compounds whereas the present invention relates to a 
polyester having an average functionality fn higher than 
2, because in formula (I) n is greater than 2. 
Furthermore, in JP-A-52003700 the two-functional esters 
are combined with epoxyfunctional resins, in contrast to 
the present invention which combines the polyester according 
to the invention with carboxyl functional polymers. Next, 
the JP-A-disclosure does not relate to powder coating 
compositions. DE-B-1030824 discloses a process with salt 
products for the manufacture of epoxide compounds 
comprising reacting a salt of a polybasic aliphatic 
carboxylic acid with an epoxide containing replacable 
halogen. The polyesters obtained by reaction of aliphatic 
carboxylic acid and alcohol are because of the relatively 
high acid values and the resulting low glass transition 
temperature of the polyester unsuitable for the 
preparation of powder coatings. In contrast, the 
polyesters in the present invention are based on aromatic 
carboxylic acids, the acid number of the starting polymers 
is between about 15 and about 95 and the glass transition 
temperature ranges between 30°C and 80°C. The glycidyl ester terminated polyesters employed in 
the invention are preferably and are readily obtained by 
dissolving a polyester having terminal carboxyl groups in an 
excess of epihaloalkane. Subsequently, a catalyst is added to 
the reaction mixture and the mixture is then stirred, at 
elevated temperature, for a sufficient selected period of time 
so that all
