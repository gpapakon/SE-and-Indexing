<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for refining crude sucrose fatty acid 
polyester reaction product involving a bleaching treatment, which 

process provides a refined polyester material wherein the level of 
intermediate molecular weight components is less than 0.2 % calculated 

by weight of said polyester, said intermediate molecular weight being 
defined as between 0.4 and 0.65 times the molecular weight of the 

fully esterified sucrose fatty acid polyester. The bleaching treatment 
comprises the use of at least one of the following bleaching agents: 


(a) mild acid activated bleaching earth, used in the substantial 
absence of water; 
(b) thermally activated bleaching earth, used in the substantial 
absence of water; 
(c) non-activated silica material; 
(d) acid activated carbon, used in the substantial absence of 
water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for refining crude 
sucrose fatty acid polyester reaction products, and in particular, 
although not exclusively, to the bleaching step in such a refining 
process and to bleached sucrose fatty acid polyester reaction products 
having a reduced level of minor components. Sucrose fatty acid polyesters are known as suitable low-calorie 
fat-replacers in edible products. While they are substantially 
indigestible for human beings, they have physical and organoleptic 
properties very similar to those of triglyceride oils and fats conventionally 
used in edible products. In addition, sucrose fatty acid 
polyesters are reported to have use as pharmaceutical agents e.g. in 
view of their ability to take up fat-soluble substances, such as in 
particular cholesterol, in the gastro-intestinal tract, and subsequently 
remove these substances from the human body. The term "sucrose fatty acid polyester" is intended to include 
any such polyesters or mixtures thereof which consist of 70 % by 
weight or more of octaesters, i.e. fully esterified sucrose fatty acid 
esters. In such polyesters, on average about 7.5 or more of the 8 
sucrose hydroxyl groups have been esterified with fatty acids, i.e. 
they have degrees of esterification of about 93.75 % or more. The term "fatty acid" refers to C₈-C₂₄ fatty acids which may be 
saturated or unsaturated, and may have straight or branched alkyl 
chains. Preferably C₁₄-C₂₂ fatty acids are present. In general sucrose fatty acid polyesters are synthesized by a 
process in which sucrose is reacted with a fatty acid lower alkyl 
ester, in particular the fatty acid methyl ester, in the presence of a 
transesterification catalyst, such as an alkali metal hydroxide or 
carbonate, and an emulsifier, such as an alkali metal soap. In a first 
stage a sucrose fatty acid mono- or oligoester is formed, which in a 
second stage is further reacted with the fatty acid lower alkyl ester 
to form polyesters of the desired degree of esterification. It is also 
possible to combine the two stages of the reaction into a single step. Processes of this type have been described in e.g. US patent 
specifications 3,963,699, 4,517,360, and 4,518,772, and EP patent 
specifications 256,585, 301,634 and 320,043.  The crude sucrose fatty acid polyester reaction products 
resulting from conventional syntheses contain, in addition to the 
desired polyesters, components such as fatty acid soaps, excess fatty 
acid lower alkyl esters and sucrose fatty acid oligoesters.
