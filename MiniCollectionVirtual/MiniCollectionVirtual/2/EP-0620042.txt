A hydrogenation catalyst obtainable by 
essentially the following steps: 


(a) treating a platinum metal salt with finely divided 
sulfur, and 
(b) then reducing the platinum metal salt to metallic 
platinum metal. 
A hydrogenation catalyst as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the particle size of the finely 

divided sulfur is less than 500 Âµm. 
A hydrogenation catalyst as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the reduction is carried out in 

the presence of a catalyst support material. 
A hydrogenation catalyst as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the process steps 

are carried out in an aqueous medium. 
A hydrogenation catalyst as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the treatment with 

finely divided sulfur is carried out in the presence of 
a surfactant. 
A hydrogenation catalyst as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the catalyst has a 

platinum metal content within the range from 0.01 to 10% 
by weight and a sulfur content within the range from 

0.005 to 0.5% by weight. 
A process for preparing a hydrogenation catalyst 
as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it essentially 

comprises 

(a) treating a platinum metal salt with finely divided 
sulfur, and 
(b) then reducing the platinum metal salt to metallic  
 

platinum metal. 
The use of the hydrogenation catalysts of any of 
claims 1 to 6 for preparing hydroxylammonium salts. 
A process for preparing hydroxylammonium salts by 
reduction of nitrogen monoxide with hydrogen in the presence 

of a hydrogenation catalyst, characterized in that 
the hydrogenation catalyst is prepared by essentially 


(a) treating a platinum metal salt with finely divided 
sulfur, and 
(b) then reducing the platinum metal salt to metallic 
platinum metal. 
A process for regenerating a hydrogenation catalyst 
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 

that essentially the following steps are carried out: 

(a) dissolving the platinum metal of the catalyst in an 
acidic medium, 
(b) neutralizing the solution obtained according to (a), 
(c) then treating the resulting platinum metal salt with 
finely divided sulfur, and 
(d) subsequently reducing the treated platinum metal 
salt to metallic platinum metal, 
 
with or without addition of a support material before, in 

or after step (c).
