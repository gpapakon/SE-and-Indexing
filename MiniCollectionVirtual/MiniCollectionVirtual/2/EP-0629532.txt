<ABSTRACT>
This device for protecting a vehicle including an engine (1) on which a fuel injection pump (2) is fixed, associated with a solenoid valve (3) for cutting the fuel supply of the engine (1), the operation of which is controlled by control means (4) connected to the rest of the circuits of the vehicle, is characterised in that the solenoid valve (3) and the control means (4) are protected against damage by a cover (6) fixed on the injection pump (2) using fastening means (7,8), at least a part (8) of which extends in front of the engine (1) when the pump (2) is mounted thereon, in order to be inaccessible and to prevent any dismounting of the solenoid valve (3) and/or of the control means (4) without dismounting the pump (2).

<CLAIMS>
An anti-theft device for a motor vehicle of the type comprising an 
engine (1), to which is fixed a fuel injection pump (2) associated 

with an electromagnetic valve (3) for disconnecting the fuel 
supply to the engine, the operation of which is controlled by 

control means (4) connected to the remainder of the circuits of 
the vehicle, the electromagnetic valve (3) and the control means 

(4) being protected against damage by a cover (6), characterised 
in that the cover is fixed to the injection pump (2) by fixing means 

(7, 8), at least one part (8) of which extends opposite the engine 
(1) when the pump (2) is mounted thereon so as to be inaccessible 

and to prevent any disassembly of the electromagnetic valve (3) 
and/or the control means (4) without removing the pump (2). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the fixing 
means comprise means (7) for hooking the cover on the pump (2) 

and means (8) for screwing the cover to the said pump.
