<ABSTRACT>
A transparent latch means responsive to a logical control signal for 
holding a circuit node between a driver means and a receiver means at 

the logical level of a data signal sensed at said node, wherein said 
transparent latch means is connected in a T-connection with said driver 

means and said receiver means, said logical control signal actuating 
said transparent latch means to either hold the data signal at said 

circuit node regardless of the state of said driver means or to pass 
said signal through.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a division of European Patent Application NÂ° 
89480053.1, filed April 11, 1989. The present invention relates generally to digital signal processing 
circuits and more specifically to a transparent latch and circuit apparatus 
for both generating and verifying parity as a function of the data 
hold at the latch. Referring first to Fig. 1, a circuit 10 is shown for bidirectionally buffering 
digital signals between, for example, first and second digital signal 
buses 12, 14. For purposes of explanation, buses 12, 14 will be described 
as 8 bit data buses. Circuit 10 includes eight, generally parallel connected, bidirectional bit 
buffer circuits, indicated at B0-B7. Bit buffer circuits B0-B7 are identical 
in construction, and only circuit B0 is described and shown in detail 
herein. Bit buffer circuit B0 comprises two generally parallel bit buffer paths, 
the first pat;h comprising a receiver 16, latch 18, and driver 20 connected 
seriatim. In the second of the bit buffer paths; a receiver 22, 
latch 24, and driver 26 are also connected seriatim, and in opposite 
order to the corresponding components of the first path. Receivers 16, 
22 comprise conventional logical bit receivers. Drivers 20, 26 comprise 
conventional logical bit drivers, each including a control terminal 28, 
30, respectively, for selectively placing the output in an active or a 
high-impedance state. Latches 18, 24 comprise conventional transparent  
 
latches, each including a control terminal 32, 34, respectively, for 
selectively placing the latch in a latched or pass-through (i.e. transparent) 
state. A parity generator 36 is provided, the inputs of the parity generator 
being connected to the inputs of receivers 16 in each of circuits B0-B7. 
Parity generator 36 comprises a conventional parity "tree" of logical 
exclusive-OR gates. For purposes of explanation, a memory device 38, 
for example a dynamic random access memory (RAM), is shown connected 
to data bus 14. In operation, circuit 10 functions generally to bidirectionally buffer data 
between buses 12 and 14. In one exemplary application, bus 12, 14 
function as local data buses in a computer system (not shown), with 
bus 12 interfacing a microprocessor and bus 14 interfacing memory 38. 
In accordance with its buffering function, when data is to be communicated 
from bus 12 to bus 14, an appropriate signal is applied to control 
terminal 30 so as to place driver 26 in a high impedance state. Data, in 
the form of a high or low logical bit 0, is sensed by
