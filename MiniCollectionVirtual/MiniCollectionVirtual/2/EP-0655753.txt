<ABSTRACT>
An active filter circuit comprises a smoothing filter including a 
choke coil with a magnetic core composed of a nanocrystalline alloy and 

having a magnetic gap in at least one portion thereof and at least one 
conductive wire wound around the magnetic core. The nanocrystalline 

alloy has a composition of 0.1 to 3 atomic % of at least one of the 
elements Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo and W, 10 to 17 atomic % of B, the 

balance being substantially Fe and inevitable impurities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boosting chopper-type active filter circuit
disposed on the input side of a power supply for improving power
factor, and a power supply apparatus with a high power factor
including such a boosting chopper-type active filter circuit.Most of switching power supplies to which commercial
electricity is applied, such as inverters, converters, choppers, etc.
include rectifying circuits of a capacitor input-type. A typical
example of such rectifying circuits is shown in Fig. 3.AC current supplied from an AC power supply A is rectified by
a diode bridge B, and smoothed by a capacitor C. The wave forms
of voltage and current in each part of the circuit in Fig. 3 are
shown in Figs. 4 (a)-(c). When input voltage Vin having a wave
form shown in Fig. 4 (a) is supplied from the AC power supply A,
the output voltage Vout of the capacitor C has a wave form shown
by the solid line in Fig. 4 (b). Here, the dotted line in Fig. 4 (b)
shows a wave form of voltage applied to a load Lo when there is
no capacitor C. As shown in Fig. 4 (c), input current Iin flows only
when the solid line and the dotted line are superimposed in Fig. 4
(b).However, in such a circuit, since the input current flows
only when the voltage is near its peak as shown in Figs. 4 (b) and
(c), the peak value of the current is inevitably high. If the current
including a lot of such higher harmonics flows through a line, the 
voltage wave form of the AC line is distorted, and the higher
harmonics enter into other equipment, resulting in the
malfunction of electric devices, etc. and a decrease in the power
factor of the AC power supply A.Various proposals have been made hitherto to solve
such problems. There is a system comprising a resistor disposed
in an input line. However, this system is disadvantageous in
efficiency, improvement of a wave form, variation of rectified
voltage due to load current, etc. There is also a simple system
comprising an inductor in an input line, which is suitable for
small-output power supply. Nevertheless, this inductor-including
system is disadvantageous because of a large size of the inductor
used, insufficient improvement of a wave form, large variation of
rectified voltage due to load current, etc. There is further a
system comprising an active filter circuit in an input line, which is
most effective and widely used for suppressing higher harmonics.
However, this active filter circuit is generally disadvantageous
because of an increase in the number of parts used and a high
cost.There is
