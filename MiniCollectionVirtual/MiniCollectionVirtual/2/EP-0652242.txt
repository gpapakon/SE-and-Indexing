<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
macromolecular compounds which are the polymers or copolymers of specific
monomers
and applications thereof. More particularly, this invention
relates to a macromolecular compound which, by virtue of the
molecular structure thereof, is advantageously usable as a
surface modifier for electrolytically polymerized films, as a
compatibilizing agent for macromolecular blends or polymer
alloys, and as an adhesive primer.As concrete examples of an electroconductive
macromolecular compound which is used as an electrode
substance, polyaniline, polypyrrole, polyacetylene, etc. may
be cited as summarized in "Handbook on New Macromolecular 
Materials", pages 191 and 192, compiled by The Society of
Polymer Science, Japan and published in 1989 by Maruzen Co.,
Ltd.These electroconductive macromolecular compounds are
characterized by the fact that the main chains themselves of
these polymers possess electroconductivity and the polymers
are caused to produce a change in color by the difference
generated in the electronic state by the alternation of a
doping and an undoping action. The feasibility of utilizing
this phenomenon of color change in electrochromic devices has
been studied as disclosed in published Japanese Patent
Application, KOKAI (Early Publication) No. (hereinafter
referred to briefly as "JP-A") 56-67,881. Besides,
polyaniline and other similar electroconductive macromolecular
compounds are expected to find utility as an electrode
material for cells and the development of these compounds for
the purpose of the utilization is now under way.
EP-A-0406849 discloses an electron-conductive high polymer, which
has at least (1) an ethylenic repeating unit having
an electron conductive side comprising at least one of aniline compounds
and heterocyclic compounds as the repeating unit in the side chain and
(2) an ethylenic repeating unit having an anionic group in the side
chain and/or an ethylenic repeating unit having a repeating unit of an
oxyalkylene group in the side chain. As concerns compounds similar to the compounds according
to the present invention, macromolecular compounds having a
thiophene polymer in the side chain thereof are disclosed in
JP-A-04-108,784. Monomers which have a thiophene polymer,
however, have no solubility in a solvent and, therefore, are
not easily synthesized by chemical polymerization. Since the
polymers obtained from these monomers have no solubility in a
solvent, they are required to undergo electrolytic
polymerization to form a film. E. Gipstein, W. A.
