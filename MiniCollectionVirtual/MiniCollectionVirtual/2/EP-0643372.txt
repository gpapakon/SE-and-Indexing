<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus (1) for dispensing and collecting trolleys (3) kept ready at a collection point (2), there being arranged at the collection point (2), on at least one retaining device (6), a number of locks (7, 8, 9 ...n) which are intended for the lockable reception of locking elements (4) fastened to the trolleys (3), and the trolleys (3) coupled to the locks (7, 8, 9 ...n) by means of the locking elements (4) being removable from the collection point (2) by the payment of a deposit or of a fee and, after use, being couplable again to the locks (7, 8, 9 ...n) at the collection point (2). The essence of the invention is that signal devices (17) located at the collection point (2) indicate to the trolley user from which lock (7, 8, 9 ...n) a trolley (3) can be uncoupled, and that, when the trolley (3) is returned, the signal devices (17) likewise indicate to the trolley user to which lock (7, 8, 9, ...n) the trolley (3) is to be coupled again.

A method of releasing and engaging trolleys (3) stored at a 
collection station (2), wherein a plurality of locks (7, 8, 9 ... n) are 

arranged on at least one mounting (6) at the collection station 
and are provided for lockably receiving locking members (4) fixed 

to the trolleys, and wherein the trolleys, connected to the locks 
(7, 8, 9 ... n) by means of the locking members (4), are removable 

from the collection station on payment of a deposit or a fee and 
are reconnectable to the locks at the collection station after use, 

characterised in that signalling devices (17) at the collection 
station (2) indicate to the trolley user the lock (7, 8, 9 ... n) from 

which a trolley (3) can be disconnected and in that the signalling 
devices (17) also indicate to the trolley user the lock (7, 8, 9 ... n) to 

which the trolley (3) is to be reconnected on returning the trolley 
(3). 
Apparatus (1) for releasing and engaging trolleys (3) stored at a 
collection station (2), wherein a plurality of locks (7, 8, 9 ... n) are 

arranged on at least one mounting (6) at the collection station 

and are provided for lockably receiving locking members (4) fixed 
to the trolleys (3), and wherein the trolleys, connected to the locks 

(7, 8, 9 ... n) by means of the locking members (4), are removable 
from the collection station on payment of a deposit or a fee and 

are reconnectable to the locks at the collection station after use, 
characterised in that a central control unit (16) is provided and is  

 
electrically connected to a coin machine (18) at the collection 

station (2), and in that each lock (7, 8, 9 ... n) has a locking device 
(15) controllable by the central control unit (16), the locking device 

(15) being provided for receiving and releasing a locking member 
(4), and a signalling device (17) being associated with each lock 

(7, 8, 9 ... n) and indicating which of the connected trolleys (3) is 
intended for removal and to which lock (7, 8, 9 ... n) a returned 

trolley (3) is to be connected. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
mounting (6) is formed as a rail-type or tubular structure, on or in 

which the locks (7, 8, 9 ... n) are fixedly mounted at predetermined 
distances. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the 
signalling devices (17) are provided either on the locks (7, 8, 9 ... n) 

or on the mounting (6). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in 
that each locking member (4) is fixed to each trolley (3) by means 

of a chain (5). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in 
that the central control unit (16) is housed in the coin machine (18). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the signalling devices (17) can be lit with varying brightness or 

flashing.  
 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that each lock (7, 8, 9 ... n) is provided with an electronic control 

unit (14) activatable by the central control unit (16). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the central control unit (16) is electrically connected to the 

locks (7, 8, 9 ... n) in parallel so that, in the event of failure of one of 
the locks (7 or 8 or ... n), the operability of the remaining locks (7 or 

8 or ... n) and the signalling devices (17) is maintained.
