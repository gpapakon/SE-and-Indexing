<ABSTRACT>
A composition which contains 35 to 85% by weight of a 
copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene (FEP), 

10 to 60% by weight of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and 
perfluoropropylvinyl ether (PFA), and 5 to 60% by weight of 

melt-processable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The 
composition is particularly suitable for use as an insulating 

material (5) on a substrate such as a resistive element in a 
conductive polymer heating cable (1). The composition has good 

physical properties, low creep, and low secondary 
crystallization, and exhibits little stress-cracking when 

exposed to elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric compositions comprising 
fluoropolymers. Fluoropolymers are well known and are widely used in a 
variety of applications due to their generally good physical and 
electrical properties and ability to withstand relatively high 
temperatures. Depending on their chemical composition, 
fluoropolymers can be thermoplastic, elastomeric, or 
thermoplastic elastomers. Commercially available fluoropolymers 
include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), tetrafluoroethylene/ 
hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP), perfluoroalkoxy resin 
(PFA), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), ethylene/ 
tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE), polyvinylidene fluoride 
(PVF₂), and polyvinylfluoride (PVF). Typically these materials 
exhibit high melting temperatures, low glass transition 
temperatures, good solvent resistance, good insulation 
properties, low coefficient of friction, low flammability, low 
gas permeability, and good physical stability. Many of these 
fluoropolymers, however, are subject to stress-cracking, 
particularly if they are thermoplastic and if the conditions of 
use require exposure to elevated temperature. Those 
fluoropolymers such as PFA which have good stress-crack 
resistance tend to be expensive but usually have more than 
adequate physical properties, e.g. flexibility and creep 
resistance, to meet product requirements. For some applications, it is desirable to blend two or more 
fluoropolymers in order to achieve advantages in terms of 
processability, temperature stability, or cost over the 
properties of the individual polymer components. For example, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,624,990 and 4,859,836 (Lunk et al, issued 
November 25, 1986 and August 22, 1989, respectively) describe a  
 
melt-shapeable composition in which a first fluoropolymer of 
relatively low crystallinity, e.g. a copolymer of 
tetrafluoroethylene and a perfluorinated comonomer, and a second 
fluoropolymer of relatively high crystallinity which is not 
melt-shapeable in the absence of other polymers, e.g. irradiated 
polytetrafluoroethylene, are mixed to produce a highly 
crystalline material that can be melt-shaped, has a high melting 
point, and good tensile and elongation properties. U.S. Patent No. 5,057,345 (Barrett, issued October 15, 
1991) discloses a composition in which a fluorinated ethylenepropylene 
copolymer is mixed with a block copolymeric 
fluoroelastomer to produce a material with high tensile 
strength, low modulus, increased flexibility, and improved 
stress-crack resistance. U.S.
