<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the preparation 
of organic isocyanates. In particular, the invention 
concerns preparation of diphenylmethane diisocyanates and 
related higher homologs, polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates, 
from corresponding carbamates in a multistep thermal 
decomposition process. Diphenylmethane diisocyanates and polymethylene 
polyphenyl isocyanates, generally referred to as "MDI" and 
"PMPPI", are widely used in the production of polyurethanes. Industrial processes for manufacture of MDI and 
PMPPI are conventionally based on reaction of phosgene with 
methylenedianiline or salts thereof. Due to the volatility 
and toxicity of phosgene, other methods have recently been 
developed, which do not require the use of phosgene. The known non-phosgene processes involve thermal 
decomposition of carbamates. Thermal decomposition of carbamates is either 
carried out in the vapour phase at high temperatures or in 
the liquid phase at lower temperatures. Due to the high temperatures necessary in the 
vapour phase decomposition processes and serious side 
reactions caused by the high temperature conditions, the 
liquid phase process has gained increasing interest in the 
commercial production of isocyanates. In the liquid phase processes described in the 
literature, the carbamates are decomposed to the corresponding 
isocyanate and alcohol typically at temperatures 
between 170°C and 350°C, while being dissolved in an inert 
solvent (GB Patent No. 1,458,595; US Patent No. 4,292,254). To obtain the desired product yield, the reaction 
time is generally between 30 minutes and a few hours.  
 
Produced isocyanates and alcohol formed during the thermal 
decomposition of carbamates are then recovered separately 
by distillation of the solution and/or stripping with an 
inert stripping agent. The decomposition of carbamates is a fairly slow 
process and catalysts have been proposed to speed up the 
reaction (EP Patent No. 28,337). Additionally, the equilibrium 
at conditions employed during thermal decomposition of 
carbamates is unfavourable for extensive decomposition to 
the alcohol plus isocyanates in the solvent. Consequently, to permit high yield of the desired 
isocyanates the alcohol-to-isocyanate ratio in the liquid 
phase should be constantly at a minimum. Based on the above consideration, the present 
invention provides a process for the preparation of organic 
isocyanates having the general formula: 
 
where Ar is a single or multiple substituted phenylgroup; 
   R is a methylene

In a process for the preparation of organic isocyanates having the general 
formula: 


 
where Ar is a single or multiple substituted phenylgroup;
 
   R is a methylene or an ethylene group; and
 
   n is a whole number of from 0 and 2,
 
   by thermal decomposition of corresponding carbamates in the presence of an 

inert solvent, comprising in multiple and separate steps thermally treating the carbamate 
dissolved in the solvent and, thereby, decomposing the carbamate to isocyanate and an 

alcohol; in intermediate steps between the steps of thermal treatment removing the 
alcohol formed during the thermal treatment by stripping the solvent with an inert 

stripping agent; and finally
 
   recovering a solution being rich in the isocyanate,
 
wherein the thermal treatment steps and stripping step is carried out in a reaction 

column being provided alternatingly with reaction volumes adapted to receive and 
thermal decompose the carbamate in the solution, and stripping trays adapted to receive 

the thermal treated solution and stripping off the alcohol from the solution by action of 
the inert stripping agent being passed through the tray and the solution. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the inert solvent is selected from the group 
comprising aliphatic hydrocarbons with a carbon number of between 8 and 16, and 

alkylated and/or halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The process of claim 2, wherein the solvent is selected from the group of decaline, o-diethylbenzene, 
o-dichlorobenzene, dodecane, hexadecane and biphenyl. 
The process of claim 2, wherein the solvent is o-dichlorobenzene.

stripping agent.
