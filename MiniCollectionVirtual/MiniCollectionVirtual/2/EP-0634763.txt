<CLAIMS>
A push button (10) for an electric switch (16) with an
actuating element (12) arranged movably in a

stationary guide means (14), with the actuating
element (12) having a cylindrical slider (20) whose

surface area (21) is provided with recesses (28) in
which rolling elements (26) are arranged which on

their part are in engagement with guideways (24) which
are provided in the stationary guide means (14) and

extend axially parallel to the cylinder axis of the
guide means (14), and with an annular gap (30) being

formed between the slider (20) and the stationary
guide means (14) which is locally interrupted by the

roller elements (26).
A push button as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that balls are provided as rolling elements (26).
A push button as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that rollers are provided as rolling elements (26)

which with their roller axis are arranged tangentially
to the surface area (21) and perpendicularly to the

actuating device of the push button.
A push button as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the recesses (28) on the

surface area (21) of the slider (20) are provided on
the circumference at a specific azimuthal distance

from one another.
A push button as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the recesses (28) on the

surface area (21) of the slider are provided at a
specific axial distance. 
A push button as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the stationary guide

means (14) and the guideways (24) arranged therein are
of uniform material.
A push button as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the guideways (24) and the

stationary guide means (14) are formed of different
material.
A push button as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a material is chosen for

the production of the rolling elements (26) which
differs from the material provided for the slider (20)

and for the guideways (24).
