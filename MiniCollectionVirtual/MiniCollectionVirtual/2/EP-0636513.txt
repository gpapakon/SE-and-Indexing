<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a folding apparatus for a motor vehicle head restraint (headrest), with a head-restraint holding part (6) which is mounted on a bearing part (2) in a manner which permits it to swivel around a swivelling axis and which can be swivelled by spring force into a folded-back position and counter to the spring force into a folded-up position, and is locked in the folded-up position in particular via a lock with a falling latch (12), and can be unlocked via a release mechanism (14), in order to release the swivelling movement, caused by the spring force, into the folded-back position. The head-restraint holding part (6) and/or the bearing part (2) is/are made of plastic.

Swing-action means for a motor-vehicle headrest,
having a bearing part (2), which can be fastened in a

vehicle, and a headrest-retaining part (6), which is
mounted on the bearing part (2) such that it can be

pivoted about a pivot axis (4), it being the case that
the pivotably mounted headrest-retaining part (6) has two

receiving openings (8) which are perpendicular with
respect to the pivot axis (4), are parallel to one

another and are intended for receiving the ends of two
carrier rods (10) of the headrest, and it being the case

that the retaining part (6) can be pivoted into a swung-back
position by spring force, for the purpose of swinging

the headrest back into a not-in-use position, and
into a swung-up position counter to the spring force, for

the purpose of swinging the headrest up into a use
position, and is locked in the swung-up position via a

catch lock (12) and can be unlocked via a release mechanism
(14) in order to free the spring-force-induced pivot

movement into the swung-back position, it being the case
that the retaining part (6) is formed in two parts from

two receiving parts (16, 18) and each receiving part (16,
18) has a pivot-bearing section (20), with a bearing

opening (22) which is coaxial with the pivot axis (4),
and a receiving section (24), with one of the receiving

openings (8) for one of the two carrier rods (10) of the
headrest, and it being the case that the two receiving

parts (16, 18) are connected via a locking rod (26) which
is parallel to the pivot axis (4) and interacts with the

catch lock (12), characterized in that the receiving
parts (16, 18), which form the headrest-retaining part 

(6), consist of plastic, it being the case that each
receiving part (16, 18), in an angle region between the

pivot-bearing section (20) and the receiving section
(24), has a connecting section (30) which has a central

wall (50), located approximately in a plane which is

characterized in that the locking rod (26), which

consists in particular of metal, is designed in terms of
its material and its dimensions and in dependence on

impact-related forces which are to be expected in the
locked, swung-up position and on the mechanical properties

of the plastic retaining part (6), such that the
forces are dissipated predominantly by deformation of the

locking rod (26), and this avoids forces being introduced
into the retaining part (6) at least to an extent which

rules out damage in the region of the retaining part (6)
and the mounting of the latter.
Swing-action means according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the locking rod (26) is positioned, by

way of its two rod ends, in mutually opposite receiving
openings (28) of the retaining part (6), at least one of

associated receiving opening (28).
Swing-action means according to Claim 3, characterized
in that each receiving part (16, 18), in its

angle region between the pivot-bearing section (20) and
the receiving section (24), said angle region being

directed towards the other receiving part (18, 16), have
the in particular approximately rectangular connecting

section (30), which contains the receiving opening (28)
for the locking rod (26).

bearing part (2) has two bearing webs (58) arranged

perpendicularly with respect to the pivot axis (4), each
bearing web (58) comprising two individual, parallel webs

(58a, 58b) which are connected to one another in the
region of bearing openings (60), preferably via additional

transverse webs.
Swing-action means according to one of Claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the catch lock (12) has a

in that, for retaining in a self-securing manner,

the pivot shafts (32, 34) are each latched with a latching
element (66a, 66b) of the bearing part (2).
Swing-action means according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that, for retaining in a self-securing

manner, the pivot shafts (32, 34) are latched with one
another in the region of their mutually facing ends.
Swing-action means according to one of Claims 10
