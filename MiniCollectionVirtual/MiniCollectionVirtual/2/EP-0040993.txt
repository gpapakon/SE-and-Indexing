<ABSTRACT>
A cargo container comprises a wall 6 having a 
ventilation chamber 50. A horizontally-extending re-en­

trant notch 55 contributes to the stiffness of an outer 
wall 54 of the chamber 50 which is not substantially 

wider than a conventional corrugated portion 12 of the 
wall 6 and does not significantly effect its strength. 

Ventilation holes 76, 78 are displaced vertically to pre­
vent rein or sea-spray entering the container. The holes 

76 allow water to drain from the chamber 50 and holes 
80 allow condensation on the inside of the container 

to drain into the chamber 50. 
Alternatively the drainage holes are not offset and 
a baffle plate is fastened within the ventilation chamber. 
In a preferred embodiment there are two ventilation 
chambers forming the uppermost and lowermost por­

tions of the container wall.

<DESCRIPTION>

 CARGO CONTAINER    This is invention relates to cargo containers and is    particularly concerned with ventilated containers which comply with
I.S.O. standards for internal and external dimensions.


 According to the present invention there is provided a cargo container having a wall including at least one ventilation chamber comprising first and second chamber walls having perforated portions, and a transverse wall which is secured and sealed to an adjacent corrugated portion of the container wall, the overall thickness of the chamber being not substantially greater than the thickness of the corrugated portion, the arrangement being such that there is substantially no direct horizontal path between the perforated portions of the outer and inner walls of the chamber.


In such an arrangement, the transverse wall provides a stiff anchorage and reinforcement for the adjacent corrugated portion of the wall and the overall wall thickness need not appreciably exceed that of a conventional dry-freight closed container. Accordingly the container can carry the same volume of cargo as the conventional container.


 Preferably the container wall has two ventilation chambers, one at the bottom of the wall and the other at the top. The wall thus formed complies with I.S.O.   standards    of rigidity and the external and internal dimensions of the container also comply with
I.S.O. standards.


 An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
   F4g.    1 is a vertical section through an upper part of a wall of a cargo container showing an upper ventilation chamber located close to the top of the wall, and
 Fig. 2 is a vertical section through a lower part of the wall shown in Fig. 1 showing a lower ventilation chamber close to the   bottom    of the wall.


 The drawings show an upper ventilation chamber 10 forming part of a side wall 6 of a cargo   container;    the upper chamber 10 is  attached at its upper edge to a roof 14 of the container and at its lower edge to a corrugated portion 12 of the wall. The corrugated portion 12 of the wall is of the type used in the walls of conventional cargo containers and extends between the upper ventilation chamber 10 and a lower ventilation chamber 50 which is fixed to a base 8 of the container.


 Referring now to Fig. 1, the upper chamber 10 is formed   from    a piece of sheet metal which is bent to form an outer wall 16, a roof 18 and a floor 20. Lips 22, 24 are formed at the edges of the

   CLAIMS:



 1. A cargo container having a T 1 including at least    one ventilation chamber comprising first and second chamber walls having perforated portions, and a transverse wall which is secured and sealed to an adjacent corrugated portion of the container wall, the overall thickness of the chamber being not substantially greater than the thickness of the corrugated portion, the arrangement being such that there is substantially no direct horizontal path between the perforated portions of the first and and second walls of the chamber.



 2. A container according to claim 1 including a said ventilation chamber in which the first and second chamber walls are inner and outer walls, the perforated portions of which are offset.



 3. A container according to claim 2 including a said ventilation chamber having a baffle plate spaced from the outer and inner walls of the chamber,
 4. A container according to claim 3 wherein both the top and bottom edges of the baffle are spaced from top and bottom walls of the ventilation chamber.




 5. A container according ary of the preceding claims wherein the ventilation chamber is formed in a hollow rail   extending    along the length of the wall.



 6. A container according to any preceding claim in which the said ventilation chamber is a lowermost portion of the said container wall, the first chamber wall being an inner wall and the second chamber wall being a bottom wall.



 7. A container according to any preceding claim in which a said ventilation chamber has drainage holes communicating the interior of the chamber with the exterior of the container.  



 8. A container according to claim 7 in which a said
Ventilation chamber is not an uppermost portion of the said container wall and has holes, for drainage of condensation, communicating the interior of the container with the chamber.


 

 9. A container according to any preceding claim having a first said ventilation chamber forming an uppermost portion of the said wall of the container, the said transverse wall being a floor and the said first and second walls being inner and outer walls of the first chamber, a second said ventilation chamber forming a lowermost portion of the said wall of the chamber, the said transverse wall being a top wall and the said first and second walls being respectively inner and bottom walls of the second chamber, and the said corrugated portion being a portion of the said wall extending between the first and second chambers.



 10. A container according to any preceding claim in which an outer wall of a said chamber is strengthened by an inwardlydirected notch portion extending substantially horzontally.
