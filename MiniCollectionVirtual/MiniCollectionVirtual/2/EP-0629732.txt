<ABSTRACT>
Device for the wet treatment of an endless textile material M by means of a treatment liquid, which comprises:   - a bowl (1) comprising an orifice (2) for the loading and unloading of the textile material to be treated and a J-shaped basket (3), in which the wet material accumulates and advances; - a closed circuit for discharging and recycling the treatment fluid, comprising an outlet port (25) located at the bottom of the bowl (1), a circulating pump, a heat exchanger, a filtration assembly and a feed port (22) to the bowl (1); - a jet (21) for impregnating and driving the material M in movement by means of the treatment liquid itself; - a means for depositing the impregnated material in the branch (5) of the J which forms the entrance of the basket (3);  characterised:   - in that, between the exit (6) of the basket (3) and the entrance of the jet (21), it also comprises a pneumatic means (11-16) intended for previously spreading this material M; - and in that, after the exit (31) of the jet (21), it comprises a deflector (35) intended for deflecting the material M to the entrance (5) of the basket (3).
