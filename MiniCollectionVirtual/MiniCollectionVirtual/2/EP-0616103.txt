<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of a housing (1) for an article to be secured, with locking means (8, 10) consisting of a non-displaceably arranged locking strap (8) with resilient tongues (9) which, in the locking state, can interlock with a displaceable bolt (10) via detent pawls (9') and which can release the lock as a result of the springing out of the free tongue ends (9'').

Anti-theft device for flat objects, in particular
video cassettes or sound cassettes and the like, composed

of a jacket (100), intended to receive the object, with
insertion opening (101') provided on a narrow side and

with a signal transmitter, arranged protected on the
jacket, for triggering an alarm, in addition with a slide

(104), which can be fitted onto the object to be protected,
holds it and can be longitudinally displaceably

inserted, together with the object, into the jacket
(100), and finally, locking means, which act between a

narrow-side inner wall (102'), leading to the insertion
opening (101'), of the jacket (100) and the slide (104)

and prevent an object (105) which has been inserted, with
the slide (104) fitted on, into the jacket (100) from

being separated from the jacket without the use of a
special tool, characterized in that the locking means

have the following elements:

a locking strip (106), which is permanently arranged in
the narrow-side inner wall (102'), lying directly

opposite the slide (104), of the jacket (100), runs
parallel to the wall and is made of spring-elastic

material and in whose plane at least one sprung tongue
(107), which can be deflected out of said plane on both

sides is provided, and out of which plane at least one
locking latch (107') protrudes towards one side, i.e.

towards the inside of the jacket, in the normal, i.e.
locked position, while the free tongue end (107'')

protrudes in a slightly angled configuration towards
the other side, i.e. towards the outside of the jacket, 

so that it can be grasped by a special tool (114) for
the purpose of unlocking, and, in the procedure, the

locking latch (107') can be pulled to the other side of
the strip, i.e. out of the locked position;
at least one recess in the aforesaid narrow-side inner
wall (102') of the jacket (100), which in the locked

position permits the free end (107") of the aforesaid
sprung tongue (107) or tongues of the locking strip

(106) to pivot out;
at least one recess (104'') in a boundary wall (104')
of the slide (104), which boundary wall (104') faces

the locking strip (106) and/or the narrow-side inner

wall (102') of the jacket and in which boundary wall
(104') the locking latch (107') or latches of the strip

(106) locks, after travelling over, and prevents the
slide (104), and/or the object to be protected, from

being withdrawn; and
openings (108) provided in the outer wall of the jacket
and a special tool (114) for insertion into these

openings, so that the tool engages under the sprung
tongue (107) or tongues of the locking strip (106), in

order to draw the locking latch (107') out of the
recess (104'') of the slide (104) for the purpose of

unlocking, and to unlock the slide (104) together with
the object to be protected.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the locking latch (107') has a rearwardly projecting

end projection, which can engage under the edge of the
recess (104") after the locking procedure.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 2, characterized
in that the locking strip (106) has a plurality

of, preferably three, sprung tongues (107) which are
arranged one behind the other and have locking latches

(107'), and in that, in the aforesaid boundary wall of
the slide (104), a number of recesses (109-111)

corresponding to the number of tongues (107) are provided
for receiving the locking latches (107').
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the special tool (114) is in the form of 

a rigid plate with a number of L-shaped unlocking fingers
(115) corresponding to the number of sprung tongues

(107), it being possible to introduce said unlocking
fingers (115) through openings in a container component

or in the jacket wall and to slide them under the free
tongue ends in order to lift up the latter and, in doing

so, lift the locking latches (107') out of engagement
with the bar or the slide (104).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that each of the sprung tongues (107) has two

parallel locking latches (107').
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that a plurality of sprung tongues (107) are

provided at regular or irregular intervals behind one
another, and in that the recesses (109-111) are arranged

in the bar and/or the slide (104) at corresponding
intervals.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that each of the sprung tongues (107) is split

along its longitudinal centre.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the locking strip (106) is composed of

metal, in particular of brass or spring steel.
Anti-theft device for flat objects, in particular
video cassettes or sound cassettes, with a container (1,

2), which is intended to receive the object and is
composed of a container lower-part (1) and connected lid

(2), and with locking means between the container lower-part
and lid and with signal transmitter, arranged on the

container, for triggering an alarm, characterized in that
the locking means have a locking strip (8), which is

permanently arranged on the inner wall of a narrow side
of the container, runs parallel to the wall and is made

of spring-elastic material and in whose plane at least
one sprung tongue (9), which can be deflected out of said

plane on both sides and out of which at least one locking
latch (9') protrudes towards one side, while the free

tongue end (9"') has, towards the other side, means so
that, for the purpose of unlocking, the locking latch 

(9') can be drawn out of the locked position in the
direction of the other side of the strip by means of a

special tool which is associated with the anti-theft
device, the inner wall of the container being designed so

as to permit the free end (9"') of the tongue or tongues
(9) of the locking strip (8) to pivot out in the locked

position, in that, in addition, a bar (10), which is
guided so as to be displaceable along the locking strip

(8), bears against the strip (8) and has at least one
recess (10') is provided, the locking latches (9') of the

strip (8) locking into said recess (10'), after
travelling over, and the bar (10) engaging, in this

position, under securing projections on the other container
part so that in the locked position the container

is prevented from being opened without the use of the
special tool, the entire configuration being such that,

by using a special tool (14), the locking latch or
latches (9') can be drawn out of the recess or recesses

(10') of the displaceable bar (10) for the purpose of
unlocking.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the ends (9"') of the locking latches (9') can be

lifted out of the locked position by magnetic fields
applied from outside the container or the jacket.
Device according to Claim 10, with at least three
locking tongues (9), characterized in that at least one

of the tongues (9) has a reversed magnetic polarity in
comparison with the other tongues, so that magnets with

correspondingly different polarity can be used for the
purpose of unlocking.
