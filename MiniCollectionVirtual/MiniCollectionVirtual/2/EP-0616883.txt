<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a glass pane which includes an electroconductive layer of ITO obtained by pyrolysis of powder compounds. For this, it proposes a glass pane which includes at least one sheet of glass coated with an electroconductive layer of ITO pyrolysed from powder compounds, combined with a flexible plastic material of the PVB, PU, PVC having an index closer to the index of the ITO layer than the index of air, and which is pressed against the said layer, and a sheet of glass coloured throughout its bulk, in the same colour as the ITO layer, and having properties of reduced energy transmission, also advantageously coming into the composition of the glass pane. The invention applies especially to the production of heated windscreens for motor vehicles.
