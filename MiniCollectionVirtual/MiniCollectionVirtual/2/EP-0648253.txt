<ABSTRACT>
Azeotropic compositions of 5-45 weight percent pentafluoroethane and 55-95 weight percent 1,1,1-trifluoroethane boil at -16.9  C and a pressure of about 51 psia. These compositions are useful as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes and as power cycle working fluids.

 TITLEMIXTURES OF PENTAPLUOROETHANEAND TRIFLUOROETHANEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to azeotropic compositions of pentafluoroethane and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane.Recently the long-term environmental effects of chlorofluoro- carbons have come under scientific scrutiny, because it has been postulated that these materials because of their high stability are able to reach the stratosphere where under the influence of ultraviolet radiation release chlorine atoms which, in turn, undergo chemical reaction in the stratospheric ozone. Reduction of stratospheric ozone would increase the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth's surface.In view of the potential environmental problem associated with stratospheric ozone depletion, there is a need for new materials possessing properties which make them useful substitutes for applications in which chlorofluorocarbons have been used and are environmentally safe. There is a limit to the number of single fluorinated hydrocarbon substances which can be candidates as environmentally safe materials. Mixtures of known fluorinated hydrocarbons, however, might be used if the desired combination or properties could be found in a given mixture. Simple mixtures, however, create problems in design and operation of refrigeration and other equipment because of component segregation in both the vapor and liquid phases. To avoid component segregation problems, it is particularly desirable to discover new substantially constant boiling fluorocarbon blends. Such blends should not suffer from component segregation problems. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict the formation of constant boiling compositions, thus complicating the search for novel constant boiling compositions which possess the desired combination of properties. There is a need for substantially constant boiling compositions that have properties which make them particularly useful as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extmguishing agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes and as power cycle working fluids and that are potentially environmentally safe. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to azeotropic compositions consisting essentially of about 5-45 weight percent, preferably about 4045 weight percent, pentafluoroethane, and 55-95 weight percent, preferably about 55-60 weight percent, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, said composition boils at -16.9° C at about 51 psia.
