controlling the distributor (80, 134) to bring about the 
lengthening of the cylinder (83, 130), a second position 

controlling the shortening of the cylinder (83, 130) and 
a neutral position in which the said electric circuits 

are open, the said kinematic connection (48) being  
 

connected to thrustors (56, 67) for controlling the knob 
(52) as a function of the angular position of the radial 

bar (21), means being provided to overcome the means for 
controlling the steering of the wheels (10, 109) and to 

maintain a neutral position in which the trailer moves in 
a straight line. 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the sleeve (25) comprises a rod 
(26), resilient means (24) for tending to keep the rod 

(26) in a position of equilibrium parallel to the axis of 
the drawbar (6), the hitch (3) being provided with 

drivers (41, 41a) intended to cooperate with the rod (26) 

so as to make it swing in one direction or the other 
corresponding to the orientation of the said hitch (3). 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that
 the drivers (41, 41a) are mounted 
swinging against the action of the resilient means (44). 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that
 the rod (26) is of an adjustable 
length. 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the rod (26) comprises a bushing 
(28) slidingly mounted and ending in a head in the shape 

of a truncated cone (43) cooperating with the drivers 
(41, 41
a
).  
 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claims 4 and 5,
characterised in that
 the draw springs (31) are inserted 
between lugs (29) integral with the bushing (28) and lugs 

integral with the sleeve (25), the said bushing being 
connected by a cable (34) to a lever (37) movable along 

a an indexed sector (39). 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that
 the sleeve (25) is integral with a 
median intermediate point of a plate (22), the ends of 

which are connected by springs (24) to a fixed point of 
the drawbar (6) so as to keep the rod (26) in a position 

of equilibrium parallel to the axis of the drawbar (6). 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the radial bar (21) is connected by 
a rod (48) to a plate (50) mounted freely pivoting on a 

shaft (16) connected to one of the fork joints for the 
steering of the wheels and on which is fixed the 

contactor (51), on the said shaft two sleeves (54, 55) 
being freely rotatingly mounted, the one of which is 

integral with an arm (55) and the other with a second arm 
(66), the arms being disposed on either side of the 

contactor (51) and each supporting a thrustor cooperating 
with the knob (52), resilient means tending to bring the 

arms closer together and the plate (50) comprising two 
stops (63, 77) intended to cooperate one with one arm and 

the other with the other arm, in such a manner that, when 
the plate (50) is displaced angularly, one of the arms 

moves away, whereas the thrustor of the other arm, by 
cooperating with the knob (52), ensures the closing of 

the corresponding electric circuit controlling the 
cylinder (83) until the knob (52) of the contactor,  

 
driven by the fork joint, comes upon the thrustor of 

the other arm to bring the knob back into the 
neutral position. 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels,

conduit supplying the cylinder (130) controlling the 
steering of the wheels (109) and an electric control 

circuit is provided which comprises an inverter 
(150) to cut off the supply to the contactor (81a) 

of the plate (125), so that when the wheels occupy 
the neutral position, when the locking cylinder is 

not supplied, it automatically occupies the locked 
position.

characterised in that
 one of the fork joints (112) 
of the wheels (109) comprises a notch (156), whereas  

 
the locking cylinder (151) is provided with a wedge 

(155) intended to be inserted into the notch (156). 
A control installation for steering the rear wheels, 
according to Claim 11,
characterised in that
 between the plate (125) and 
one of the fork joints (112) for steering the wheels 

(109), on the kinematic connection (141, 143), is 
inserted a second plate (142) rotating on a fixed 

shaft (145) on which a contactor (146) provided with 
a knob (147) is locked, the second plate (142) 

comprising two thrustors (148, 149) cooperating with 
the knob (147) and the one being capable of being
