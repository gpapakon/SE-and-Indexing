3-(2-fluoro 2-chlorovinyl) cyclopropane carboxylate.
Preparation process for the compounds of formula (I)
as defined in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in

that an acid of formula (II) :


in which R
1
 and R
2
 retain their previous meaning, or a
functional derivative of this acid, is subjected to the

action of an alcohol of formula (III):

 
or a functional derivative of this alcohol in order to

obtain the corresponding compound of formula (I).
The compositions intended for combating parasites of
vegetation, parasites of premises and parasites of warmblooded

animals, characterized in that they contain at
least one compound defined in any one of claims 1 to 3 as

active ingredient.
The insecticide compositions, characterized in that
they contain at least one compound defined in any one of

claims 1 to 3 as active ingredient.
The insecticide compositions defined in claim 5,
characterized in that they are intended to
 combat
DIABROTICA and the other parasites of the soil.
The acaricide and nematicide compositions,
characterized in that they contain at least one compound

defined in any one of claims 1 to 3 as active ingredient.
Combinations endowed with insecticide, acaricide or
nematicide activity, characterized in that they contain

as active ingredient, on the one hand, at least one of
the compounds of general formula (I) and on the other

hand, at least one of the pyrethrinoid esters chosen from
the group constituted by the esters of allethrolone, of

3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimidomethyl alcohol, of 5-benzyl-3-furyl
methyl alcohol, of 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and of

alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol with chrysanthemic
acids, by the esters of 5-benzyl-3-furyl methyl alcohol

with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-oxo-3-tetrahydrothiophenylidenemethyl)-cyclopropane-carboxylic
acids, by the esters

of 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and of alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl
alcohol with 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic

acids, in which "halo" represents
a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom, it being understood

that the compounds (I) can exist in all their possible
stereoisomeric forms as well as the acid and alcohol

copulas of the above pyrethrinoid esters.
