<ABSTRACT>
The annular seal (4) is designed to be fitted, and to provide sealing, between a rotating shaft (1, 3) and a fixed part (2) through which the shaft passes, and comprises:   - a rubbing ring (5) designed to be fitted tightly onto the shaft (1, 3) and to rotate with it, - a sealing ring (6) with a flexible lip (7) in contact with the rubbing ring (5), the sealing ring being secured to the fixed part (2), - an internal annular protection element (8) secured to the sealing ring (6) and taking station in the vicinity of one end of the rubbing ring (5), and - an outer annular protection element (9) secured to the sealing ring (6) and taking station in the vicinity of the other end of the rubbing ring (5).   The two protective elements (8, 9) lie within the axial (A) and radial (D) overall size of the sealing ring (6).

Annular seal (4) designed to be mounted between a rotating 
shaft (1, 3) and a fixed part (2) through which the shaft (1, 

3) passes, comprising: 

a friction ring (5) designed to be fitted on the shaft 
(1, 3) and to rotate with the latter, 
a sealing ring (6; 6a), the profile of which has a "U" 
or "C" shape, with a flexible lip (7) held under pressure 

against the cylindrical external face of the friction ring 
(5), and connected, in an area of reduced thickness (12), to 

an intermediate annular part (11), and with a peripheral 
cylindrical part (10) designed to be secured to the said fixed 

part (2), 
an internal annular protection element (8; 8a), the 
peripheral part (17) of which is secured to the sealing ring 

(6; 6a), and the inner circular edge of which is fitted in the 
vicinity of one end of the friction ring (5) whilst having 

radial clearance (18) with respect to the rotating shaft (1, 
3) or to the friction ring (5), and 
an external annular protection element (9; 9a), the 
peripheral part (21) of which is secured to the sealing ring 

(6; 6a) and the inner circular edge of which fits in the 
vicinity of the other end of the friction ring (5) whilst 

having radial clearance (22) with respect to the rotating 
shaft (1, 3) or to the friction ring (5), characterised in 

that the internal annular protection element (8) and the 
external annular protection element (9; 9a) fit within the 

axial (A) and radial (D) dimensions of the sealing ring (6; 
6a). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the internal annular protection element 

(8, 8a) is a rigid piece having a plane annular part (16), the 
inner circular edge of which cooperates with one end of the 

friction ring (5), and a cylindrical peripheral part (17) 
fitted and bonded in the peripheral part (10) of the sealing 

ring (6; 6a). 
Seal for a rotary shaft according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that 
the external annular protection element 
(9) is a rigid piece having a plane annular part (20), the 

inner circular edge of which cooperates with the other end of 
the friction ring (5), and a cylindrical part (21) fitted and 

bonded in the sealing ring (6), in front of the connection 
area (12) for the flexible lip (7). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the external annular protection element 

(9a) is formed by an annular extension of a rigid internal 
reinforcement (13a) of the sealing ring (6a), the annular 

extension (9a) extending outside the flexible material of this 
ring (6a) in the direction of its central axis, to fit close 

to one end of the friction ring (5). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the external annular protection 

element (9; 9a) has a double friction area relatively to the 
friction ring (5). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the double friction area results from 

the cooperation of the aforementioned two parts (20, 21) of 
the external annular protection element (9) with, 

respectively, an annular piece made of thin sheet metal (24) 
mounted on one end of the friction ring (5), and this end of 

the friction ring (5).  
 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the double friction area results from the 

cooperation of the aforementioned two parts (20, 21) of the 
external annular protection element (9) with, respectively, the 

front face of the friction ring (5) and a collar (25) on this 
friction ring (5). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the axial clearance between 

the front face or faces of the friction ring (5) and the inner 
circular edge of at least one of the internal (8) and external 

(9; 9a) annular protection elements, is designed to be adjusted 
by interposing a material which is consumable by wear (28, 29). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 8, in which the internal protection element (8; 8a) 

has in its plane annular part (16) at least two holes (19) for 
the circulation of a fluid to be sealed in present inside the 

fixed part (2) through which the rotating shaft (1, 3) passes, 
characterised in that an annular filter (23) is mounted in the 

annular recess in the sealing ring (6), resulting from its 
profile in the shape of a "U" or a "C", the annular filter (23) 

coming into contact with the plane annular part (16) of the 
internal protection element (8; 8a) provided with the holes (19). 
Seal for a rotating shaft according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the annular free space (26) 

situated in front of the flexible lip (7) of the sealing ring (6) 
is filled with grease.
