<ABSTRACT>
A method is described that attenuates reverberations in ocean bottom cable data used to generate a seismic profile. First, a seismic wave is generated and recorded by pressure and particle velocity sensor pairs. Adding the product of the pressure data times the absolute value of the velocity data and the product of the velocity-data times the absolute value of the pressure data eliminates-reverberations, leaving a combined signal that is a function of only the primary wave response signal. Dividing this combined signal by 2 and a sensitivity scaling factor, and then taking the square root of the result produces the magnitude of the primary signal. Replacing the positive/negative sign of the combined signal that existed before taking the absolute value provides the proper polarity. The data are then incorporated into a seismic profile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seismic profiling of formations located under bodies of
water using pressure-velocity bottom cables.Marine seismic exploration is an extremely important tool for location of offshore
reserves. One known procedure for marine seismic exploration involves use of an
ocean bottom cable as illustrated in prior art Fig. 1. Surveys using ocean bottom cables are
typically employed in areas populated with numerous obstacles, such as drilling and
production platforms. In this technique, several miles of bottom cables 11 (only one shown
in the Fig. 1) are deployed along the sea floor 13 by vessel 15. Usually, multiple cables 11
are deployed in parallel, as shown in Fig. 2. The bottom cable 11 is provided with a
plurality of sensor pairs 17 placed at regular intervals along the cable, each sensor pair 17
containing a pressure sensor (e.g., hydrophone) and particle velocity sensor (e.g., a
geophone). Acoustic energy is generated in the vicinity of the cable using an air gun array
or a marine vibrator array 19. The source wavelet travels downward through the earth and
is partially reflected by subsurface layers (formation 21 in Fig. 1) that present an acoustic
impedance contrast. The primary reflected wavelet 23 travels upwardly from the
subsurface layer, and the pressure waves generated by the upward-traveling reflection are
detected by the sensor pairs 17.Seismic exploration using ocean bottom cables is complicated by secondary
waves such as wave 25, known as "ghosts," that are received by the sensors pairs 17 as
downward-traveling reflections after reflecting off the air/water boundary at the surface 29.
The air/water boundary is an efficient reflector, and thus the ghosts are significant in
amplitude and are difficult to differentiate from the primary waves. These ghosts adversely
affect the data obtained during the exploration by attenuating certain frequencies. In
addition, when the water depth is large, the spectral ghost notches fall in the seismic
frequency band and drastically affect the seismic resolution. Resolution is further
complicated by multiple reflection waves and water layer reverberations such as wave 27.The purpose of using both hydrophones and geophones in the ocean bottom 
cable is to capitalize on the differences between these two types of sensors to attenuate the
downgoing waves which include the ghosts and the water layer reverberations. Their
responses to the primary reflections are in phase, but are 180- out of phase to the ghosts
and to the reverberations.Fig. 3a
