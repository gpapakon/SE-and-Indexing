<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating sensitive teeth with an oral composition
containing specific phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides, and to oral compositions suitable
for that purpose.Tooth sensitivity (dentinal hypersensitivity) is a painful response to physical, chemical
or thermal stimuli and can affect one in seven dentate adults. Although the clinical features
of dentinal hypersensitivity are well described the physiological mechanisms are not as well
understood. The most widely accepted theory suggests that dentinal tubules act as channels
that enable the different stimuli to reach the pulp and elicit pain. Compounds used in treating
hypersensitive dentine include formalin and silver nitrate, glycerine, strontium chloride,
dicalcium phosphate, potassium nitrate, sodium fluoride, sodium citrate, calcium hydroxide,
resins, potassium oxalate stannous fluoride and cyanoacrylate. It is believed that most of the
above agents reduce dentinal hypersensitivity either by mineralizing, or precipitating at, the
entrance of the dentinal tubules thereby blocking stimuli.The present invention provides an oral composition when used to treat dentinal
hypersensitivity, said composition containing a dentinal hypersensitivity reducing or relieving
amount of one or more active component(s) selected from a casein, a component of casein
(αs-casein or β-casein), a phosphoprotein, and a phosphopeptide or salts thereof which
contains a sequence of amino acyl residues -A-B-C- where A, B and C are independently
phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, phosphohistidine or phospholysine, in a
pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier.The preferred sequence is -Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)- where Ser(P) is phosphoserine.
This sequence is found in the phosphoprotein casein and in some casein-derived peptides.The preferred casein phosphopeptides contain 3 to 40 amino acyl residues and include
the sequence -Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)- where Ser(P) is phosphoserine.The oral composition may be in the form of a liquid dentifrice, mouthwash, toothpaste.
gel, lozenge, tablet, powder or other pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle suitable for use in
treating dentinal hypersensitivity.The preferred oral compositions may also contain an effective amount of phosphatase
inhibitor or phosphopeptide stabilising agent (eg. a fluoride. carrageenan, β-glycerophosphate,
vanadate or anionic polymer) (carboxylate polymer eg. Belsperse 161®. vinyl ether maleic acid 
polymers, sulfonate polymers or phosphonate polymers or

phosphopeptide or salts thereof which contains a sequence

of amino acyl residues -A-B-C- where A, B and C are
independently phosphoserine, phosphothreonine,

phosphotyrosine, phosphohistidine or phospholysine, in a
pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier

further containing an effective amount of a phosphatase or
peptidase inhibitor for the manufacture of a medicament for

treating dentinal hypersensitivity.
The use of claim 1 wherein said sequence of amino
acyl residues is -Ser(P)-Ser(P)-Ser(P)- where Ser(P) is

phosphoserine.

phosphopeptides (CPP) are in the form of divalent or

trivalent metal ion complexes.
The use of claim 5, wherein the complexes are
selected from CaCPP, FeCPP, ZnCPP, calcium phosphate CPP

and calcium fluoride phosphate CPP.
