<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
transporting and positioning micro-mechanical parts. In terms of micro-mechanical parts, preformed parts are to 
be understood, and therefore not naturally occurring parts. 
The term "micro-mechanical part" includes both "oblong" as 
well as "planar" parts. In respect of oblong 
micro-mechanical parts, such manufactured parts are to be 
understood which have a cross-sectional dimension in the 
order of micrometers or millimeters, but the longitudinal 
dimensions thereof can be desirably longer. Such oblong 
micro-mechanical parts can, for example, be micro-surgical 
needles, threads or wires. The cross section of such 
manufactured parts can be circular, elliptical, oval, 
rectangular, triangular or polygonal and also have any 
desired open or hollow geometries. The cross section can 
also vary as appropriate along the longitudinal length of 
the part. In respect of planar micro-mechanical parts, such 
manufactured parts are to be understood which are 
substantially planar, namely plate- or disc-shaped, for 
example. Their thickness dimensions are in the order of 
micrometers or millimeters, while the length and width 
dimensions can be substantially greater. The planar 
micro-mechanical parts can have the most varying surface and 
edge contours. The micro-mechanical parts can be metallic or 
parts consisting of plastics or of natural materials such 
as, for example, natural textile fibers.  
 Up to now, during the individual processing steps within a 
production and packaging process, micro-mechanical parts are 
either transported and positioned by means of a mechanical 
gripper or handled manually, for example, by means of a 
pincer. In the case of manual handling, the transport or 
positioning of micro-mechanical parts previously required 
the use of microscopes and, in the case of machine handling, 
the use of very complex mechanical and optical systems. The 
main problem with current handling methods consists in that 
the micro-mechanical parts are mechanically gripped and can 
be easily damaged as the thickness of, for example, a 
micro-surgical needle can be only 70 Âµm, for example. As the 
handling forces are often very large, very slight but 
undesirable plastic deformation of the manufactured part can 
occur. Furthermore, positioning of a micro-mechanical part in the 
micrometer range is particularly difficult, as the moving 
mechanical gripper means must be precisely positioned with 
respect to a micro-mechanical part. In previous handling
