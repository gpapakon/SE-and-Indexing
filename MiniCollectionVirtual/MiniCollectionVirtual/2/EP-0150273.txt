<ABSTRACT>
A distributed, interactive data processing system 
provided with the ability to allow concurrent multi-lingual 

use by a plurality of users having different national lan足
guage preferences is further provided with the ability to 

allow a message to be sent across nodes in the data 
processing system and still display the message in the 

preferred national language of the receiving node. The 
sending node and user (1) determine the message identi足

fication of the message to be sent, and the names of the 
variables in that message as well as their content (5), and 

the identification of the user and node (3) to receive the 
message. A system service (6) is called and passed the 

message identification, variable names and data, and the 
identification of the receiver. The system service (6) con足

nects to the receiving node and user (3). The message 
identification, the variable names, and the data associated 

with each variable are assembled into a string. At the re足
ceiving node (3), a system service (7) receives the passed 

string and places the variable data in the correct variables 
and invokes the system COMPOSE function. The resulting 

message is therefore displayed to the user of the receiving 
node (3) in the preferred national language.

<DESCRIPTION>

 MULTI-LINGUAL SYSTEM ACROSS NODES
 Field of the Invention
The present invention is directed to improvements in data processing systems which allow concurrent multi-lingual use, and more particularly, the invention insures that the correct national language is used even when a message is sent across nodes in a data processing system.


 Background of the Invention
The change from centralized, batch operations of data processing systems to distributed, interactive usage has resulted in more users being directly involved with these systems. When a data processing system is used in a country with multiple national languages or is accessed by user terminals located in different countries with different national languages, the system must accept commands and respond in the national language or languages of the users.


In the past, support for national languages has been accomplished by placing all messages in a selected national language, or on a user by user basis such that each user will see messages of one national language. The first approach fails to offer a solution for users in a country, such as
Canada, where there are more than one national language. Both approaches handle output only, are typically limited to messages, and have the following problems 1.
Language-dependent text other than messages exist in most
 computers in the form of language dependent (a) common
 verbs entered as input, such as "Delete", which must be
 recognizable by a program without need for separate
 programs to handle each national language, (b) keywords
 entered as input in commands or as screen panel fields,
 such as   "source,    (c) online documentation, or (d) prompts
 and help information.  


2. They do not allow appropriate responses trom service
 functions in a connected computer that has no knowledge of
 the   requestorWs    language preference. For example, a user
 may invoke service A on computer 1. Service A may request
 assistance from service B on computer 2, and service B may
 need to send messages to the user even though the usage is
 indirect.


3. They do not allow use of a new function that is supported
 in a language that could be understood by the user if the
 preferred language is not yet available.


Even where the national language problem is solved, the fact that computer users are becoming more heterogeneous as the usage of computers spreads raises other problems. For example, not only may the national language preference of users in a distributed data processing system differ, but the level of

 CLAIMS



1. In a method of providing a distributed, interactive data
 processing system with concurrent multi-lingual use by a

 plurality of users having different national language
 preferences, said method including the steps of

 establishing a message model data collection by storing
 message models via a message identifier primary key that

 is common to all usage and a secondary key that is the
 national language index, using a central message service

 to compose messages from message models received from said
 message model data collection using said primary and

 secondary keys in response to a call from an application,
 application control or supervisor program, and

 communicating the composed messages to users in their
 national language preference,


 the improvement which allows
 a sending process to send a message across a node in the

 data processing system to a receiving process and display
 the message in the preferred national language of the

 receiving user comprising the steps of
 at the sending node, determining the message

 identification of the message to be sent, and the names of
 the variables in the message as well as their content, and

 the identification of the user and the node to receive the
 message;

 sending the message identification, the names of the
 variables in the message and their content to the

 identified receiving node;
 at the receiving node, placing the variable data in the

 correct variables to form a message model and using said
 central message service, composing a message from the

 message model using the secondary key at the receiving
 node; 


 and  
 communicating the composed message to the user at the

 receiving node in the national language identified by the
 secondary key.




2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of
 sending is performed by assembling the message

 identification, the names of the variables in the message
 and their content into a string which is passed to the

 receiving node.



3. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the
 step at the sending node of returning to the application

 that generated the message after the step of sending.
