<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed herein provides an aqueous formulation of rapamycin
for intravenous injection (iv). In one aspect the invention comprises a concentrate
solution of rapamycin in N,N-dimethylacetamide, in combination with a diluent
consisting of a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester, polyethylene glycol 300 and water, all
in given proportions as described below.Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Strepromyces hygroscopicus
which was discovered first for its properties as an antifungal agent. It adversely affects
the growth of fungi such as Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum. Rapamycin,
its preparation and its antibiotic activity were described in US. Patent No. 3,929,992,
issued December 30, 1975 to Surendra Sehgal et al. In 1977 Martel, R. R. et al.
reported on immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin against experimental allergic
encephalitis and adjuvant arthritis in the Canadian Journal of Physiological
Pharmacology, 55, 48-51 (1977). In 1989, Calne, R. Y. et al. in Lancet, 1989, no. 2,
p. 227 and Morris, R. E. and Meiser, B. M. in Medicinal Science Research, 1989, No.
17, P. 609-10, separately reported on the effectiveness of rapamycin in inhibiting
rejection in vivo in allograft transplantation. Numerous articles have followed
describing the immunosuppressive and rejection inhibiting properties of rapamycin, and
clinical investigation has begun for the use of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in
transplantation in man.Rapamycin is insoluble in water and is only slightly soluble in solubilizers,
such as propylene glycol, glycerin and PEG 400, commonly used in preparing
parenteral formulations. It is only sparingly soluble in PEG 200 and 300 and is
insoluble or very slightly soluble in commonly used aqueous injectable co-solvent
systems, such as, 20% ethanol/water, 10% DMA/water, 20% Cremophar EL®/water
and 20% polysorbate 80/water. For these reasons commercially acceptable injectable
formulations of rapamycin have been difficult to make. An injectable composition of
rapamycin is described in European Patent Publication No. 0041795, published
December 16, 1981. In this injectable formulation rapamycin is first dissolved in a low
boiling point organic solvent, namely, acetone, methanol or ethanol. This solution is
then mixed with a nonionic surfactant selected from polyoxyethylated fatty acids; 
polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols; and polyoxyethylated glycerin hydroxy fatty acid
esters, e.g. polyoxyethylated castor oil, exemplified by Cremophor® EL and
polyoxyethylated hydrogenated
