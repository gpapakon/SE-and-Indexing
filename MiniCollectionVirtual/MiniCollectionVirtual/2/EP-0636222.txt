<ABSTRACT>
The bearing of a machine tool spindle is sealed by a pair of wiping seals mounted on the shaft and resiliently urged into contact with opposite faces of a stationary ring through which the shaft extends. The very small clearance between the ring and the shaft is fed with gas for example air at low pressure. When there is no gas supply and for example when the shaft is stationary the seals contact the ring and the resilience ensures good contact and prevents seepage of for example lubricant along the shaft from one side of the seals to the other. When the shaft is to be driven, low pressure gas is supplied and this pressure deflects the seals to lift them from the face of the ring so that there is no frictional engagement and either power loss or heat generation, and any liquid which does go past the seals is thrown outwardly by centrifugal force and driven by the escaping gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to machine tool spindles 
which support a cutting tool at one end and are 
journalled in bearings. It is usual to supply 
coolant/rinsing fluid such as suds to the tool, and it is 
important to prevent that fluid reaching the bearings. 
It is also usual to supply lubricant to the bearings and 
it is also desirable to prevent that lubricant leaking 
externally. So one or more seals are interposed between 
the bearings and cutting tool. This creates problems. It is usual to employ wiping seals which maintain 
contact between rotating and non-rotating parts even when 
the rotation ceases. The wiping seal has to be 
resiliently held in place. It is known to use so-called 
V -rings which comprise a ring to fit tightly on the 
spindle and an integral radial flange, made from a 
slightly resilient material such as a suitable plastic or 
rubber. However, the wiping creates friction, which 
leads to temperature increase and this call lead to 
inaccuracy in the machining operation because the spindle 
centre positions will vary between cold and hot 
dimensions. Sometimes the shaft needs to be locally 
hardened or provided with for example ceramic surfaces as 
a seal component and to reduce wear and that also is 
expensive. Labyrinth seals are often employed to avoid friction 
and its consequent heat and wear but multiple component 
labyrinths complicate the design, increase expense, and 
require additional length which is a disadvantage in many 
designs. Another well known seal system employs radially 
extending flanges freely located so that liquid - 
lubricant or coolant - creeping along the spindle will 
reach the flange and be thrown off by centrifugal force 
into an annular collector space. But these, like 
labyrinth seals are primarily and sometimes exclusively 
useful when the spindle is in use. When stopped for any  
 
reason, undesired flow can occur from liquids already in 
place. DE 34 38 755 A discloses a shaft seal in which a ring is 
mounted for rotation with the shaft and is normally 
resiliently urged against the stationary part and that 
part is provided with many small holes or a narrow gap or 
is porous so that air can be blown through to displace 
the lip out of contact. The lip is displaced out of 
contact by centrifugal force as the shaft speed increases 
and/or can be lifted by the air pressure at lower speeds. In DE 27 09 243 A a pair of lip seals are provided on 
opposite faces of the stationary part one of which is 
intended to be lifted by fluid pressure and the

A machine tool spindle arrangement comprising: 

a spindle (10) supported by bearings (14,16) and 
extending in succession through said bearings, then 

through a fixed part (26) and then towards an end adapted 
to be fixed to a cutting tool or the like; at least one 

wiping seal (22,24) which is mounted on the spindle (10) 
or fixed part (26) and normally makes contact with the 

fixed part (26) or spindle (10), and 
means (28,30,32) for applying fluid pressure to said at 
least one seal (22,24) for displacing the same out of 

said contact 
 
characterised in that 


said fixed part (26) has a small clearance between its 
bore and spindle (10), and has a rebate (34) between its 

opposite faces, 
a pair of said wiping seals (22,24) is provided, one 
associated with each of said faces, 
each seal (22,24) being located in a corresponding 
collection chamber (36,37), 
said fixed part (26) has a passage (32) extending 
therethrough and opening to the rebate (34) for delivery 

of said fluid pressure for flow axially in both 
directions through said small clearance to both seals, 

and that 
both said chambers (36,37) have vent passages for escape 
of fluid pressure entrained with fluid arriving at the 

corresponding seal after seepage along the spindle from 
either direction. 
A machine tool spindle arrangement as claimed in Claim 1 where 
the seals are oppositely inclined to form a V shape. 
A machine tool spindle arrangement as claimed in Claim 1 wherein 
the purge gas is air at a pressure about 0.14 kg/sq. cm. 
A machine tool spindle arrangement as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the seals are mounted on the spindle for 

rotation therewith whereby, at high rotational speeds 
they may lift and fling off liquid due to centrifugal 

force.
