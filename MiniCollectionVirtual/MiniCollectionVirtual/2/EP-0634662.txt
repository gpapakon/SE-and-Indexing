<ABSTRACT>
In a method for digitizing the voltage signal and current signal of an electronic watt-hour meter to calculate 
electric power by digital multiplication, the circuit has a small analog scale, signals are mainly digitally processed in 

the circuit, and the circuit can be composed of ICs, thus enhancing the accuracy of calculating the power. A voltage 
signal (v) and a current signal (i) are respectively inputte
d into analog-digital converting means comprising sigma-delta 
modulation circuits (10 and 11) and others. The outputs are averaged by running by the running-averaging means (12, 

13, 14 and 15) which are low-pass filters. Then the voltage is multiplied (18) by the current. The analog scale in the 
sigma-delta modulation is small. Also, the scale of circuit is small by the adoption of low-pass filters provided for 

the running average. Further, the power calculation can be made at a high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic watt-hour 
meter for converting a voltage and a current of analog 
input signals into digital values and processing the digital 
values. FIG. 34 shows a block diagram of a circuit for 
calculating an electric power of a conventional electronic watt-hour 
meter. In FIG. 34, numeral 71 denotes a first successively 
comparing type A/D converter to which an analog current signal 
is entered, numeral 72 denotes a second successively comparing 
type A/D converter to which an analog voltage signal is entered 
and numeral 73 denotes a multiplier to which digital data 
corresponding to a voltage value and a current value from the 
respective successively comparing type A/D converters 71, 72 is 
entered. As shown in FIG. 34, the conventional electronic watt-hour 
meter includes the first and second successively comparing 
type A/D converters 71, 72 as means for converting analog 
quantities of a voltage and a current into digital values, and 
an electronic energy w is obtained by calculating these digital 
outputs by the multiplier 73. In general, since the successively comparing type A/D 
converters 71, 72 quantize an analog input signal to a digital  
 
value in such a manner that an output is discretely increased 
with respect to the analog input signal by the same resolution, 
a successively comparing type A/D converter with a high 
resolution is needed to obtain an absolute precision to a low 
level input. For example, when a current signal is supposed to be 
1/120 of a maximum input, the following condition must be 
satisfied in order to keep an accuracy of a quantized current 
value to 0.5% or less. 
   A successively comparing type A/D converter has an S/N 
ratio represented by

S/N = 6m + 1.8 (dB)   (2) 


 
where, m is the number of output bits of the successively 
comparing type A/D converter when sampling frequency 
fS = 2× (signal frequency). Thus, a successively comparing type 
A/D converter having a resolution of m = 15 bits is needed to 
keep the aforesaid precision of 0.5% or less. On the other hand, as a method of improving a 
precision, there is a method of increasing a sampling frequency 
(fS) of a successively comparing type A/D converter, i.e., a so-called 
over-sampling method. For example, when a sampling frequency (fS) is 
increased to a frequency which is 128 times a sampling frequency 
(fS = twice a signal frequency) determined by Nyquist theorem, a 
quantized noise is dispersed to a wide bandwidth and a level of  
 
spectrum of each
