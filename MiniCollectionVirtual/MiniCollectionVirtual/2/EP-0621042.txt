<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive composition (14), and the surgical dressing (10) of 
which it is a part, in which the composition takes the form of 

a water-absorbing and water-swellable hydrocolloid material 
distributed throughout the interstices of a three-dimensional, 

open-mesh, randomly-oriented network of flexible, water-insoluble, 
polymeric filaments, such filaments being surface 

coated by a tacky, water-insoluble adhesive material that has 
an adherence affinity for the filaments and that secures such 

coated filaments together at their points or zones of contact. 
When hydrated, the hydrocolloid material swells and become a 

gelatinous continuous phase, with the network of filaments 
expanding to retain the hydrated hydrocolloid material within 

the dressing. Despite the phase change, the water-insoluble 
adhesive material is also retained within the dressing because 

of its strong adherence to the filaments of the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical field of
surgical dressings and adhesive compositions for surgical
dressings or skin-adhering devices such as ostomy products,
mammary prostheses or any alternative product to be fixated to
a skin surface part of a patient or person.Numerous adhesive compositions known as hydrocolloid
compositions or materials are known, e.g. from US Patents No.
3,339,546, 4,192,785, 4,296,745, 4,367,732, 4,813,942,
4,231,369, 4,551,490, 4,296,745, 4,793,337, 4,738,257,
4,867,748, and 5,059,169, to which reference is made and which
are hereby incorporated in the present specification by
reference.Conventional hydrocolloid material-containing adhesive
compositions comprise a particulate hydrocolloid material such
as gelatine, carboxymethylcellulose, and pectin, or mixtures
thereof, and a binder or adhesive component which is mixed
with the hydrocolloid material in an intimate composition of
particulate material in which, following hydration of the
hydrocolloid material, the adhesive component constitutes
droplets providing adhesion to the skin surface part of the
patient or person to whom the surgical dressing or other skin-adhering
device is to be adhered by means of the adhesive
composition.It has been realized that the hydrocolloid material-containing
adhesive composition has to fulfill certain 
requirements as to flexibility and cohesion in order to, on
the one had render it possible to shape the adhesive
composition in conformity with the skin surface part of the
patient or person to which skin surface part of the surgical
dressing or the skin-adhering device is to be fixated and
further to allow any adaptation to changes of the shape of the
skin surface part in question and, on the other hand, for
preventing components of the adhesive composition,
particularly the tacky adhesive component itself, from
becoming separated from the major body of the adhesive
composition and eventually left at the skin surface part of
the patient or person as the surgical dressing or the skin-adhering
device is removed from the skin surface part in
question.Where the adhesive composition is part of an adhesive
surgical dressing for the treatment of wounds, such as bed
sore or pressure sore, the hydrocolloid material-containing
adhesive composition further has to exhibit a high liquid- or
water-absorbing capability.In the present context, the term "liquid" means any
water-based liquid such as any body fluid, e.g. blood or
blood-containing biological liquid, or simply water.An object of the
