<ABSTRACT>
A nipple having a variable, adjustable flow 
responsive to the nursing infant is provided. The nipple 

also has the further attribute that pressure may be 
applied at essentially any angle and will still produce 

the desired flow rate/pressure relationship. The nipple 
has an opening comprising three slots extending through 

the walls and radiating from a point located substantially 
at the center of the nipple end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nipple to be mounted on 
a baby bottle to feed infants. More particularly, this 
invention relates to a nipple having an opening for 
withdrawal of the contents of the bottle by an infant 
which provides for a variable flow of the contents in 
response to the infants instinctive reactions and which 
will provide such flow virtually irrespective of the 
rotational orientation of the nipple as secured to the 
bottle or as gripped by the infant. The art is now replete with various suggestions and 
products wherein nipples, formed of soft and elastic 
rubber or synthetic elastomers are affixed to baby bottles 
and provided at the ends thereof with openings. Such 
openings have varied in shape from a simple centrally 
located circular hole to a single slot to a combination of 
a slot with a hole at each end to an x-shaped opening 
comprising intersecting slots. Examples of such 
suggestions can be found in U.S.Patents 420,651; 774,848; 
981,072; 2,223,179; 2,520,157; 2,688,326; 2,707,470; 
2,720,328; 2,942,746; 3,139,064; 3,335,890; 3,516,564; 
3,650,271; 4,676,387; and Des. 273,896; and U.K Patent 
Application No. 2,215,318A; and PCT Application No. 
FR90/00123. It has been discovered that in delivering fluids to 
an infant via the opening in a nipple, several criteria 
must be considered. Firstly, it is believed that the 
infant tends to control the rate of flow to that desired 
by increasing the pressure of its lips as applied to the  
 
nipple, i.e. the greater the demand, the greater the 
pressure applied. Therefore a well designed opening will 
respond accordingly; the greater the pressure applied, the 
wider the opening and hence the greater the flow. It will 
be understood that in describing the pressure exerted by 
the infant, in reality such pressure translates to a given 
deformation of the elastic material of the nipple. Hence 
as is used herein such terms as pressure and deformation 
are qualitatively equivalent. Secondly, the bottle when held by the infant or the 
adult feeding the infant must be held in an orientation 
with respect to the infant's application of pressure to 
the nipple such that the above relationship applies. For 
example, if the opening is a single slot, pressure applied 
to each of the longitudinal sides of the slot will 
actually close the slot and frustrate the infant's 
attempts to increase the flow. On the other hand, 
pressure applied to the ends of the slot will open the 
slot further and increase the flow. Thus, the feeder, 
using a single

<CLAIMS>
A nipple having variable, adjustable and 
substantially uniform directional flow and adopted to be 

attached to a baby bottle; said nipple having an opening 
comprising three slots extending through the walls of the 

nipple and radiating from a point substantially at the 
center of the end of the nipple; said slots being spaced 

apart at angles of from about 100 to about 140 degrees. 
The nipple of claim 1 wherein the slots are spaced 
apart at angles of from about 110 to about 130 degrees. 
The nipple of claim 2 wherein said slots have a 
length which is greater than the thickness of the nipple 

wall at the situs of the slot. 
The nipple of claim 3 wherein the slots vary from the 
length of about 1 mm. to about 3 mm. 
The nipple of claim 1 assembled on a right 
cylindrical baby bottle. 
The nipple of claim 1 assembled on an angled baby 
bottle.
