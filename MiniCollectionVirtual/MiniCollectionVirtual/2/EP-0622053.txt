<ABSTRACT>
A rehabilitation prosthetic system for toothlessness comprises prefabricated elements for fastening on a lower or upper jaw, such as an arched bridge member (2), two or more, essentially rotationally symmetrical intermediate pieces (3), a fixture (1) of essentially rotationally symmetrical design which can be implanted in the jaw bone for each of the intermediate pieces (3), an arched dental bridge (6) provided with teeth (6) and an arched profiled element (41) carrying the teeth (6). The profiled element (41) has a groove on its underside against which the bridge member (2) rests. The prosthetic system furthermore comprises means (34) for fastening of intermediate pieces (3) to the fixtures (1), means (66) for fastening of the bridge member (2) on the intermediate pieces (3) and means for fastening of the dental bridge (4) on the bridge member (2). The last-mentioned means comprise fastening means provided on or in the profiled element (41). The prosthesis is provided with shock-absorbing means (44).

A prosthesis system for the rehabilitation of
toothlessness, having: prefabricated elements provided

for attachment to the upper and lower jaws; an arcuate
bridge member (2); two or more substantially axially

symmetrical fixtures (1) implantable in jaw bone; an
arcuate toothbridge (4) provided with artificial teeth

(6); and an arcuate profile element (41) bearing the
teeth (6), the profile element (1) being disposed with

its underside adapted to bear against the top side of
the bridge member (2), the system also having means (64,

67) for attaching the profile element (41) to the bridge

member (2), the last-mentioned attaching means comprising
attaching means provided on or in the profile element

(41), characterised by substantially axially symmetrical
intermediate members (3) for each fixture (1),

means (38) for attaching the bridge member (2) to the
intermediate members (3), and means for attaching the

intermediate members (3) to the fixtures (1), the bridge
member (2) being a prefabricated, standardised element.
A prosthesis system according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the underside of the profile element

(41) has a longitudinal furrow for receiving the bridge
member (2).
A prosthesis system according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the side walls of the furrow of the

profile element (41) have in the direction of the row of
teeth a straight or curved inclination for the purpose

of bearing against the top side and the front/rear side
of the bridge member (2).
A prosthesis system according to Claims 1-3, characterised
in that the means (64) for attaching the

profile element (41) to the bridge member (2) extend in
substantially the horizontal direction.
A prosthesis system according to Claims 1-4, 
characterised in that the bridge member (2) has on its

underside a cylindrical bore for each intermediate
member (3), the bore being either continuous (21) or

non-continuous and being adapted to receive a cylindrical
seat portion (35) of the intermediate member (3).
A prosthesis system according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the seat portion (35) of the intermediate

member (3) extends in the direction of the top end
of the intermediate member (3) from supporting members

(31) for supporting the bridge element (2).
A prosthesis system according to Claims 1-6, characterised
in that the bottom end of the intermediate

member (3) is provided with an external threading (34)
for releasable attachment in an internal threading of

the fixture (1).
A prosthesis system according to Claims 1-7, characterised
in that on its side remote from the gums the

tooth bridge (4) is at least partially lined with plastics
material comprising a flexible outer layer (43)

enclosing a resiliently compressible inner layer (42).
A prosthesis system according to Claim 8, characterised
in that the outer layer (43) is attached to the

lower front and rear edge (27, 28) of the profile element
(41) and to the base of the teeth (6).
A prosthesis system according to one of Claims 1-9,
characterised in that the means for attaching the bridge

member (2) to the intermediate members (3) comprise
means forming hard layers (66) and selected from the

group formed by quick-curing compositions, such as
hardenable plastics, more particularly hardenable isocyanates

and polyurenthanes, and porcelain cement, screw
means (38) or combinations thereof.
A prosthesis system according to one of Claims 1-10,
characterised in that the means for attaching the

toothbridge (4) to the bridge member (2) comprise second 
screw means (64; 67) guided through holes (23) in the

bridge member (2) and releasably fixed in the profile
element (41).
A prosthesis system according to one of Claims 1-11,
characterised in that damping means (44) are provided

between the toothbridge (4) and the bridge member
(2), the damping means preferably comprising polymeric

materials.
A prosthesis system according to one of Claims 1-12,
characterised in that sealing means (44, 47) are

provided between the toothbridge (4) and the bridge
member (2).
A prosthesis system according to Claim 13,
characterised in that the damping means (44) also include

the sealing means (44).
