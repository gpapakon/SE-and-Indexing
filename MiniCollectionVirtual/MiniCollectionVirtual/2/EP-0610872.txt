<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an electron beam display device which 
has high contrast and excellent image quality, by eliminating 

halation due to re-collision of the electrons in the fluorescent 
element area. The present invention provides an electron beam 

display device comprising
 

   a face glass (8) on which an image is formed,
 

   a cathode for emitting electron beam,
 

   a fluorescent element layer (9) present on the face glass (8) 
with facing the cathode, to which electron beam is collided to 

emit light for forming an image on the face glass (8),
 

   an aluminum layer as anode (20), present on said 
fluorescent element layer (9), and

 
   a carbon layer (21) present on the aluminum layer (20), having 

such a thickness sufficient to prevent returning electrons 
reflected in the aluminum anode (20) layer by collision of electron 

beam with the aluminum anode layer (20) back into the face glass (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron beam display device comprising
a face glass on which an image is formed, a cathode for emitting an electron
beam, a fluorescent element layer present on said face glass with facing said
cathode, to which the electron beam is directed to emit light for forming an image
on said face glass, an aluminium layer as an anode, present on said fluorescent
element layer, and a carbon layer present on said aluminium layer. More particularly,
such a display device is to be used in connection with video appliances and
should have a high contrast ratio.Such a display device is already known from EP-A-0 446 878 and will be 
described with reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows the principle of such
a flat plate type display device. Electrodes
are disposed in a vacuum container not shown in the drawing,
and number 1 is a back electrode, and 2 denotes a plurality of
linear cathodes which emit electron beams. Number 3 is an
electron beam focusing electrode, 4 is a modulation electrode, 5
is an electron beam focusing electrode, 6 is a horizontal
deflecting electrode, 7 is a vertical deflecting electrode, 8 is a
face plate, and 12 is an electron beam.Fig. 7 shows a detailed
sectional view of the face plate 8. Number 9 denotes a
fluorescent element and 10 is an anode composed of an aluminum
layer. When the cathode 2 is heated, an electron beam is
released, and passes through the electron beam controlling
electrode group, and collides against the anode 10 to illuminate
the fluorescent element 9, thereby forming an image. However, when an electron beam is irradiated to the
anode of the conventional flat plate type electron beam display
device, part of the electron beam is reflected by the anode and
come back to the cathode side. The reflected electrons are
returned back by action of high electric field applied between
the cathodes and anodes for accelerating electron beam, and
again dived into the anode. These reflected electrons cause dim
lits in the surrounding area of the electron beam irradiation
point, which is called "halation". In particular, when the anode
voltage is raised, the energy of the reflected electron is
increased, and this phenomenon becomes more serious. This
phenomenon was a serious problem for image performance
because the image contrast is lowered and the sharpness is
sacrificed.In order to reduce the halation, it has been proposed
that a shadow mask is disposed in front of the anode electrode
to trap electrons reflected from the surface of the anode
electrode
