<ABSTRACT>
A fiber-optic system includes a photodetector (16) for 
receiving optical signals from a light source (12), a 

threshold producing circuit (26) coupled to the 
photodetector (16), and a delay block (28) coupled to 

the photodetector (16). The threshold producing circuit 
produces a decision threshold voltage ((V
T
)) in response 
to signals from the photodetector (16). The delay block 

(28), formed of one or more stages of all-pass filter 
(60), delays the signals from the photodetector (16). 

The outputs of the delay block (28) and the threshold 
producing circuit (26) are connected to the inputs of a 

comparator (52). By providing a delayed signal, the 
decision threshold voltage ((V
T
)) is established in the 
comparator (52) before the delayed signals reach the 

comparator (52). In this manner, pulse width distortion 
is largely eliminated in the first bit of data in burst 

mode data and the dynamic range of the overall system is 
preserved. In some cases, a multi-staged delay (100) 

causes DC offset error in the delayed signal to the 
comparator (52). To reduce this error, a DC offset 

correction circuit (110) coupled to the delay block 
(100) corrects the DC offset error through the use of 

negative feedback across the delay block (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber-optic systems,
and, more particularly, to an analog delay line for
reducing pulse width distortion of the first bit of burst
mode data from a fiber-optic receiver.Fiber-optic transceiver systems typically include a
driver circuit for controlling a light source coupled by
optical fiber to a photodetector coupled to a receiver
chip. The driver circuit takes a digital pulse stream
input and controls the light source to transmit optical
signals through the optical fiber. The photodetector
detects the optical signals and produces electric pulses
in response to the optical signals. A switching circuit,
also on the receiver chip, receives amplified electric
pulses from the photodetector and produces a digital pulse
stream in response to the electric signals. The digital
pulse stream output from the receiver chip is ideally
identical to that on the driver circuit.In operation, the switching circuit uses an internal
decision threshold voltage which is compared to each of a
series of voltage signals from the amplified photodetector
signal. The decision threshold determines the presence of
a signal. Based on these comparisons, the switching
circuit outputs the digital pulse stream. A DC coupled fiber-optic receiver with a wide dynamic
range typically derives its decision threshold from the
amplitude of the voltage signals from the amplified
photodetector signal. The decision threshold voltage
ideally has an amplitude that is equal to one-half of the
peak amplitude of the voltage signals. This allows the
system to have high dynamic range and low pulse width
distortion.Presently available fiber-optic systems use either a
fixed decision threshold or a threshold that adapts to the
incoming voltage signals after the first voltage signal
passes through or nearly passes through the switching
circuit. Each such system suffers from disadvantages that
limit its desirability. In systems having a fixed
threshold, the potential range of input voltage signals is
limited to those that are compatible with the fixed
threshold. Although such systems do not suffer from
excess pulse width distortion for the first pulses in data
bursts, they have a limited dynamic range, typically about
10 dB.In systems having a threshold that adapts to the
first incoming voltage signal, the dynamic range is
significantly greater, approximately 20 dB, but the first
bit of digital output can suffer from excess pulse width
distortion. This distortion occurs because, by the time
the threshold adapts, the first
