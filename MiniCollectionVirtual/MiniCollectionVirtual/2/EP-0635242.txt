<ABSTRACT>
A thrombectomy method and apparatus for dissolving a 
soft fibrinous obstruction, such as a recently formed 

thrombus, within a patient's vascular system, either in a 
patient vein or artery or in a prosthetic implant, employing 

a soft rotating brush (10) for separating and mixing the 
fibrin of the thrombus while a dissolving agent, e.g. 

streptokinase or urokinase, is introduced and mixed in and 
applied to the separated fibrin. The brush (10) is formed 

of soft, flexible bristles (12) that extend outward from the 
distal end of an elongated, flexible, rotatable drive shaft 

(14) having a drive motor assembly (50) attached at its 
proximal end. An introducer catheter (30) is introduced and 

advanced through a patient's blood vessels until the distal 
end opening (32) is positioned adjacent the soft fibrinous 

thrombus. The brush (10) is passed through the introducer 
lumen (34) and out distal opening (32) to place the brush 

bristles (12) in contact with the soft thrombus. The 
dissolving agent is introduced during rotation of the brush 

(10) either through the introducer catheter (30) lumen (34) 
or a drive shaft lumen and out exit ports (46, 68) at the 

distal ends thereof in the region of rotation of the 
bristles (12) for dissolving the soft thrombus as it is 

mixed by the bristles (12). The bristles (12) are 
sufficiently resilient and dimensioned for enabling 

compression and passage of the bristles (12) out of and back 
into the introducer lumen distal opening (32) and mixing 

into the fibrin of the soft thrombus, while not damaging the 
vessel wall. Optionally, a balloon catheter (82) or a mesh 

basket may be coaxially introduced through the drive shaft 
lumen (45) and placed downstream to restrain fragments and 

to allow the dissolving agent to complete the dissolution 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thrombectomy
apparatus for removing a soft, newly formed thrombus or
blood clot from a blood vessel, and particularly to the
application of an obstruction dissolving agent into the
fibers of the obstruction as the fibers are mixed and
exposed by a soft, flexible rotating brush for fragmenting
and dissolving the fragments of the obstruction in situ.The acute symptoms of blockage of a vein at a venous
valve or a partially sclerosed and narrowed artery may be
instigated by the presence of a soft blood clot which may
either form at the site or form elsewhere, as through trauma
or injury to the vascular system, at a cardiac valve or at
the site of an access fistula for enabling chronic
hemodialysis and be carried to the site by the flow of
blood. In the venous and arterial blood vessels, such clots
are referred to as an embolus or emboli and a thrombus or
thrombi, respectively. Emboli and thrombi are characterized
by a soft consistency that maintains a form and is resistant
to dissolution in the bloodstream or in water and entraps
red blood cells. Under the microscope it can be seen that
this clotting behavior is effected by strands of fibrin
which are formed of normally soluble fibrinogen molecules
which undergo a conversion to stranded fibrin in response to
a chemical released at the site of an injury to a blood
vessel wall in order to prevent the loss of blood through
the injured wall. Recently formed blood clots stabilized in
position as emboli and thrombi are soft and jelly-like in
consistency and are readily penetrated but reform after the
penetrating object is removed.The invasive removal of both soft and hard obstructions
from arteries and prostheses implanted to substitute for
diseased arteries or to retain arteries open to blood flow
has become commonplace. Over many years, a patient's 
arterial system may become narrowed and eventually occluded
with relatively hard, calcified plaque resulting in reduced
blood flow and consequent oxygen deprivation, to organs and
muscles supplied by the arterial system. The progress of
atherosclerosis in a given patient may not be diagnosed
until the onset of an ischemic episode triggering the
symptoms of chest pain or heart failure, with respect to
cardiac arteries, or a stroke or eyesight failure, if the
carotid artery or its tributaries are blocked. Usually, the
cardiac arteries in patients that suffer ischemia and have
become blocked slowly over the years develop collateral
blood vessels that take over or share the burden of
