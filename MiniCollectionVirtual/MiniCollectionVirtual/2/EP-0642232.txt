<ABSTRACT>
A radio communication system comprises a primary 
station (1) including a transmitter (2) and receiver (26), 

and at least one secondary station (6) including a 
transmitter (7) and receiver (8). In order to reduce the deleterious 

effects of multipath propagation between the 
stations, at least the receiver (26) in the primary station 

is provided with an antenna (5) having at least three 
elements (12,14,16) in a non-planar configuration which 

elements are continuously coupled (24) to the receiver (26). 
The elements are arranged to have a low value of cross 

correlation to provide good reception diversity in a compact 
space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio communication 
system having particular, but not exclusive, application to a 
mobile radio communications system for use in built-up areas. Contemporary radio communication systems which employ 
either a number of widely spaced secondary stations in 
communication with a primary station or at least one mobile 
station in communication with a primary station are known to 
be troubled by multiple communication paths between the 
stations. This phenomenon, known simply as 'multipath', is 
more pronounced in built-up areas and, in a mobile system, is 
compounded by the fact that the propagation path(s) between 
the primary station and the mobile station are constantly 
changing. In an attempt to solve these problems, spatial 
diversity has been employed at the receiving antennas of the 
primary stations of such systems. Spatial diversity provides 
two or more antennas mutually spaced by 10 to 20 wavelengths 
or more at the operating frequency. The outputs of the 
antennas are combined with the aim of providing a 
sufficiently strong signal to the receiver regardless of the 
direction of signal arrival. The technique relies upon 
providing antennas having low values of cross-correlation. 
The main difficulty with spatial diversity is that, even at 
900 MHz, an antenna spacing of 20 wavelengths is equivalent 
to 6 metres which is impossible to achieve at mobile stations 
and is usually difficult to achieve at primary station sites. As an alternative solution, a mutually tilted antenna 
arrangement has been proposed in 'Base Station Polarization 
Diversity Reception for Mobile Radio' by Kozono et. al. in 
IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology Vol. VT-33, No.4 
November 1984. This arrangement works on the principle that 
the propagation environment depolarises the signals so that 
if an incoming signal is weak in one plane, it will be  
 
comparatively strong in another plane orthogonal to it. The 
main drawback of that antenna arrangement is that there are 
always a pair of opposing azimuthal directions in which the 
antenna diversity provides no improvement whatsoever. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
radio communication system which ameliorates the 
disadvantages discussed above. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a radio communication system comprising a 
primary station and at least one secondary station, the 
primary station comprising transmitting means and receiving 
means and the at least one
