<ABSTRACT>
In a mixing and flame stabilising device in a combustion chamber with premixing combustion, a gaseous and/or liquid fuel is injected into the combustion air. The combustion air is guided via vortex generators (9), of which there is a plurality which are arranged next to one another over the width or the circumference of the combustion chamber duct (20) through which flow occurs. The fuel is introduced into the duct (20) in the immediate vicinity of the vortex generators (9). A vortex generator (9) has three surfaces over which flow occurs freely and which extend in the direction of flow and of which one forms the top surface (10) and the two others form the side surfaces. The side surfaces enclose with one another the sweep angle ( alpha ), which varies in the flow direction, and the top surface (10) extends relative to the duct wall (21) at a setting angle (angle of attack) which varies in the flow direction. Such vortex generators can be used to obtain an intimate mixing of combustion air and fuel within a very short distance, and the flame can be stabilised aerodynamically at the same time.
