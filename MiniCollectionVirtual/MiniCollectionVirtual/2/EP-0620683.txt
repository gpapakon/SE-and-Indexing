<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling recording and reproduction 
in a video cassette tape recorder capable of, in a recording 

mode, separating specific data for speed-varied reproduction 
from compressed digital video signals, recording them on 

designated tracks, recording position information of the 
designated tracks on a control track by an index head or 

recording position information of recording position-synchronized 
blocks at the starting portions of the designated 

tracks recorded with the specific data, and in a speed-varied 
reproduction mode, controlling a capstan servo speed so as to 

maintain the travel of a magnetic tape at a normal speed and 
periodically or non-periodically accelerate or decelerate it 

where specific data for varied-speed have been recorded 
periodically or non-periodically on predetermined portions of 

tracks, thereby making heads travel repeatedly at the normal 
speed and the high speed and thereby detect continuously the 

specific tracks for varied-speed. A repeatability of 
reproduced video at a varied speed is obtained without any 

deterioration in picture quality, because of recording of 
specific data for speed-varied reproduction and continuous 

detection of the specific data in the speed-varied 
reproduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for
controlling recording and reproduction in a digital cassette
tape recorder.For analog/digital conversion for converting an analog
video signal into a digital video signal and linear
quantization, a signal transmission rate of about 100 Mega
bits per second is typically required in the case of normal TV
broadcast signal such as NTSC, SECAM and PAL signals. On the
other hand, high definition TV (HDTV) signal with higher
resolution than that of the normal TV broadcast signal
requires a signal transmission rate higher than 100 Mega bits.For achieving data transmission in a limited transmission
band, digitalized video signals should be transmitted in the
form compressed in accordance with the video data compression-technique.
In the case of digital cassette tape recorders
(digital VCRs) having a limitation on record bandwidth,
signals recorded on a magnetic tape may be digital, normal TV 
signals having the form of compressed signals or digital, HDTV
signals having the form of compressed signals.Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a conventional
recording circuit for such a digital VCR. As shown in FIG. 1,
the recording circuit includes an interface 1 for converting
a compressed digital video signal into a signal having the
recordable form, an interleaving and channel-dividing circuit
2 for interleaving an output V1 from the interface 1 in a
predetermined form to reduce bursts error and channel-dividing
it to be matched with the zero bandwidth of a recording
channel, recording formatters 3A and 3B for respectively
converting outputs V2 and V3 of the interleaving and channel-dividing
circuit 2 to record formats each including a
synchronous signal, an identification signal and redundancy
bits for error correction codes, channel modulators 4A and 4B
for modulating outputs V4 and V5 of the recording formatters
3A and 3B, respectively, recording amplifiers 5A and 5B for
amplifying outputs V6 and V7 of the channel modulators 4A and
4B, respectively, a drum pulse generator 7 for outputting two
pulses at every rotation of a head drum 6 caused by driving of
a drum motor M1, and switches SW1 and SW2 for performing their
switching operations based on an output SWP from the drum
pulse generator 7 to selectively transmit outputs V8 and V9 of
the recording amplifiers 5A and 5B to heads HD1 (or HD3) and
HD2 (or HD4), respectively. In FIG. 1, the reference numeral 
8 denotes a guide pin, 10 a pinch roller, and 9 a capstan
adapted to be rotated by a capstan motor M2.FIG. 2
