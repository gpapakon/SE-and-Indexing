<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a force-transmission element for a drive on a sliding door in the form of a rack for the engagement of a pinion of the drive motor, in the case of which there is provided a carrier element (7) which can be connected to the sliding door (1) and to which there is connected at least one plastic toothing element (10), the teeth (12) of which are held by laterally delimiting webs (13) which are fixedly connected to said teeth. Consequently, with the same cross-sections, higher forces can be transmitted even using common plastic strengths.

A power transmission element (2) for a drive on a sliding door in the 
form of a rack for the engagement of a pinion (3) of the drive motor (4), with a 

carrier element (7) connected with the sliding door (1) and constructed as a 
C-section, with which at least one tooth element (10) of a corrosion-resistant 

material is connected, characterised in that the tooth element (10), consisting of 
a plastic over a majority of its length, has a base (11) with which the teeth (12) 

are connected and that the base (11) has cross-pieces (13) laterally delimiting 
the teeth (12) and firmly connected therewith. 
A power transmission element according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the tooth element (10) is divided into several partial elements. 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the base (11) of the tooth element (10) is provided on its 

side facing away from the teeth (12) with a back groove (14) running in 
longitudinal direction. 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the C-section (7) of the carrier element is provided at both 

its ends with stop pieces (17, 18) for the tooth element (10) and that at least 
one stop piece (18) is constructed so as to be able to be braced in longitudinal 

direction. 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that several partial elements are braced in the C-section (7). 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the partial element (22), which is in engagement with the  

 
drive pinion (3) in the closed position of the sliding door (1), consists of a 

metallic material. 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the C-section (7) is provided on its reverse side with 

through-bores for screw bolts (8) and that the width of the back groove (14) of 
the tooth element (10) corresponds to the key width of the head (16) of the 

screw bolts (8) which are to be inserted. 
A power transmission element according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the carrier element (7) is provided on its side facing away 

from the tooth element (10) with a hollow rail (23) in which electric control 
leads are arranged and in which a sliding piece (27) is guided, which projects 

outwards with an extension (26) through an elongated slot (25), in which the 
extension is fastened to a fixed door piece and serves as connecting element for 

the control lead between the movable and fixed door piece. 
A power transmission element according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
in the hollow rail (23) guide means (28) are arranged for the control leads. 
A power transmission element according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the hollow rail (23) is constructed so as to be divisible longitudinally and one 

part serves as a cover (24).
