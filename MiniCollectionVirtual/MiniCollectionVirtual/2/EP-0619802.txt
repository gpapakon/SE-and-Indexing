<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols of 22 to 38 carbon atoms can be obtained by saponifying and extracting steps with organic solvents from sugar cane wax. The mixture which contains tetracosanol, hexacosanol, heptacosanol, octacosanol, nonacosanol, triacontanol, dotriacontanol and tetratriacontanol can be used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerotic complications as platelet hyperaggregabiulity, ischemia and thrombosis, and prevents drug induced gastric ulcer and improves male sexual activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a mixture of higher primary
aliphatic alcohols, containing alcohols of a range from 24
to 34 carbon atoms and more especially, those with straight
chain of 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32 and 34 carbon atoms.This mixture shows a relative composition of each alcohol,
that is highly reproducible batch to batch.In the European Patent Application 0488 928 is described a
mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols from 24 to 34
carbon atoms with a quantitative correlation between alcohols that can be used as an active principle of
pharmaceutical formulations used for the treatment of
hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlypoproteinaemia type II and
stimulation of sexual behavior in animals and humans.According to the present invention this mixture of higher
primary aliphatic alcohols from 24 to 34 carbon atoms
(thereafter called M.H.P.A.A.), in a relative narrow
quantitative correlation, shows new properties such as
antiplatelet, antithrombotic and/or anti-ischemic agents, as
well as for the antagonism of drug-induced ulcers and that
is why this specific mixture can be used as active
ingredient of pharmaceutical formulations prepared for these
purposes.A further object of the invention is to place at the public's
disposal M.H.P.A.A. of 24 to 34 carbon atoms in combination with salicylic acid for
pharmaceutical formulations.In this application it is described how
to obtain, isolate
and purify this, particular, mixture of higher primary
aliphatic alcohols (M.H.P.A.A.) of 24 to 34 carbon atoms
from the sugar cane wax, both from raw and refined wax.Lipid-lowering effects of sugar cane wax have been 
demonstrated in rats (Fukuda, Effects of sugar cane wax on
serum liver lipids on rats; Chemical Abstracts, 106, 17,
137413p) and mice (Sho H. et al (1984; Effects of Okinawan
sugar cane wax and fatty alcohols on serum and liver lipids
in the rats; J.Nutri. Vitaminol 30 (6) 553- 559).Firstly, effects of sugar cane wax on serum and liver
lipids were investigated in male Wistar rats fed high
levels of plants and animal fats. The authors found that
addition of 0.5 % of sugar cane wax to dietary fat
reduces significantly serum triglycerides in rats fed
plant or animal fats, but only in the last ones
cholesterol levels decreased significantly, without
affecting the content of liver lipids. Hence, the authors
concluded that sugar cane wax shows hypolipidemic
effects.On the other hand, Sho H. et al (1984) studied the
effects of Okinawan sugar cane wax on serum and liver
lipids in rats fed a diet containing
