<ABSTRACT>
Device for the quick change of tracks, which is suitable to 
cooperate with a traction unit (12) of a type with two 

facing tracks (11) such as that of EP-A-548723, for 
instance, and comprises a movable trolley (13), which has in 

a position substantially at the front of the traction unit 
(12) a first withdrawal and delivery position (13a), a 

second replacement position (13b) and an intermediate 
rotation position (13c) for pre-arrangement of the new set 

of tracks (111).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device for the quick change of
tracks, as set forth in the main claim.The device for the quick change of tracks according to the
invention is employed to replace the upper and/or lower
tracks respectively of a traction unit associated with a
drawing machine.This replacement of the tracks is necessary both for
maintenance and also whenever the section to be drawn is
changed, inasmuch as the outer surface of the links forming
the tracks has a shape that mates with the form of the
section to be drawn.EP-A-548723 discloses a system to feed drawn bars which
consists of a traction unit comprising a pair of facing
tracks.Each track includes an endless catenary of links.The links have their engagement surface mating with the
shape of the section to be drawn.At the present time the replacement of the tracks of the
traction unit is carried out by a plurality of workers with
a series of long, tiring and also dangerous operations.To be more exact, after the track to be replaced has been
disengaged from the traction unit, that track is withdrawn
by using a hoist or another known lifting system and is
replaced by another track, which too is handled with the
same system.These changes of tracks therefore entail a series of long,
burdensome, complex and also dangerous operations since
tracks are being handled which have a great weight.Moreover these operations require long replacement times
during which the drawing machine has to stay still, and
therefore lower the output of the whole system. The present applicants have designed, tested and embodied
this invention to overcome the shortcomings of the state of
the art and to achieve further advantages.This invention is set forth and characterised in the main
claim, while the dependent claims describe variants of the
idea of the main embodiment.The purpose of the invention is to provide a device for
the quick change of tracks associated with a traction unit
of a drawing machine.The device for the quick change of tracks according to the
invention enables the tracks to be replaced in a quick and
safe manner and reduces the downtimes of the drawing machine
considerably and therefore increases the output.The quick change device according to the invention
requires the attendance of only one machine operator for its
actuation and needs no physical effort by that operator.The device for the quick change of tracks comprises a
movable trolley including a turntable with a vertical axis,
upon which are fitted the means which withdraw the tracks.The movable
