<ABSTRACT>
Fluorinated polymers having high structural regularity, 
characterized by a high maximum operating temperature and by 

improved mechanical and processability properties, are 
prepared by a (co)polymerization process of fluorinated 

olefinic monomers, optionally in association with non-fluorinated 
olefins, in aqueous emulsion, in the presence of 

radical photoinitiators and of ultraviolet-visible radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a (co)polymerization 
process of fluorinated olefinic monomers in aqueous emulsion, 
which allows to obtain products having high structural 
regualarity, characterized by a high maximum operating 
temperature and by improved mechanical and processability 
properties. Among the known techniques for the (co)polymerization of 
fluorinated olefinic monomers, optionally in association with 
non-fluorinated olefins, the most widely used, also on an 
industrial scale, are those in aqueous emulsion and in 
suspension, in the presence of radical initiators. In the case of emulsion (co)polymerization, the polymer 
is produced in the form of particles dispersed in an aqueous 
medium by a suitable surfactant. This allows to dissipate the 
reaction heat very efficiently, hence achieving a good control 
of reaction temperature and thus a high productivity. 
Moreover, the absence of organic solvents implies lower 
process costs and lower environmental impact. The aqueous emulsion technique shows, however, some 
drawbacks due to the reaction conditions required. In fact, 
the use of radical initiators which decompose thermally makes 
necessary to adopt relatively high reaction temperatures,  
 
ranging from at least 50°C even to 150°C. Polymerization 
temperatures of this kind negatively influence the 
characteristics of the final product, in particular they cause 
a lowering of the second melting temperature and therefore a 
limitation in the maximum operating temperature of the polymer 
(the so called "rating temperature"). Such an inconvenience is particularly evident in the case 
of partially hydrogenated polymers. For instance, it is known 
that vinylidene fluoride homopolymer shows much more defects 
of monomeric inversion as far as the polymerization 
temperature is higher. The increase of such defects leads to 
a decrease of the crystallinity percentage and thus of the 
second melting temperature, which, as known, determines the 
maximum operating temperature of the product. Similarly, for 
ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymers and especially 
ethylene/chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, an increase in 
the polymerization temperature implies a drastic decrease in 
comonomer alternation, with formation of blocks which worsen 
both mechanical performances and thermal stability of the 
product. This fact explains why the emulsion 
(co)polymerization technique is not used for the synthesis of 
ethylene/chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, for which 
suspension technique at a
