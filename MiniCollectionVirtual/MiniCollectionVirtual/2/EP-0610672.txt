<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a time division 
switch used in digital exchange systems and particularly 
relates to a time division switch enabling effective 
execution of failure detection test for such time 
division switch. One of the most distinctive characteristics of 
the digital exchange system is its time division for 
exchange where one speech bus carries digital (PCM) 
signals by means of time division multiplexing. To 
exchange such digital signals, a digital exchange system 
comprises semiconductor devices such as memory switches 
and gate switches for message channels. Both of the 
memory switch and gate switch are widely and generally 
utilized applications of LSI technology. They are 
advantageous to obtain more economical systems of smaller 
size. The message channel in a digital exchange system 
has, as a main component, a semiconductor device called 
"Time Division Switch" (Time switch or "TDSW"), which can 
input data to the time slots. The time switch comprises, 
for data replacement, memory devices capable of writing, 
storing and reading voice information bit strings. It is  
 
difficult from the viewpoint of engineering, however, to 
constitute a large scale digital message channel with a 
time switch alone, when considering the operation speed 
of such memory devices. The time switch is an indispensable element in a 
message channel for a digital exchange system. It 
comprises speech path memories (hereinafter referred to 
as "SPM"), which are memory devices corresponding to the 
voice information bit strings as described above, speech 
path control memories (hereinafter referred to as 
"CTLM"), and a read/write address counter, and is 
provided with following functions. An SPM stores digitally coded voice information 
on the data highway. The storage capacity of the SPM 
corresponds to the total number of time slots (channels) 
for the highways related to the time switch, i.e. the 
product of highway multiplexing and the number of 
highways. An CTLM is a memory to specify write and read 
addresses for the speech memory. The read/write address 
counter generates sequential addresses for sequential 
reading or writing of digitally coded voice information 
to be sent to the highway at the speech memory and 
control memory. In an actual digital exchange, a plurality of 
highways from the transmission line are gathered to form 
a highly multiplexed highway, which is then connected to  
 
a time switch. When the multiplexing of a time switch is 1024 
(unit capacity for time
