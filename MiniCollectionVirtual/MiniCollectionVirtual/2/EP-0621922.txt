<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with improving charge 
preparation in an internal combustion engine. In an engine in which fuel is injected into the intake port, 
there is a tendency for the fuel to collect as a pool on the 
back of the intake valve. Despite the high temperature of 
the valve, the fuel is not vaporised as the air in the port 
is stagnant when the valve is closed. Air assisted sprays have been proposed, for example in US-A-4,475,486 
or GB-A-2 031 995, in which an air gallery supplies air to blow the 
spray in the direction of the intake port. However, despite 
these and other attempts to produce a fine spray by the 
injector, the charge entering the combustion chamber when 
the intake valve opens is far from homogeneous. The 
accumulation of fuel in the intake port also produces 
hysteresis effects which cause emission problems during 
transient operation. The present invention seeks to vaporise the fuel that tends 
to collect in the intake port in order to mitigate the 
foregoing disadvantages. The present invention provides nn internal combustion engine 
having an intake valve, an injector for directing a metered 
jet or spray of fuel into the intake port and means for 
directing a jet of air at the back of the intake valve to  
 
assist in vaporisation of any fuel collecting in the intake 
port, wherein the means for directing a jet of air comprises 
a fluidic ejector formed of an external air supply jet an 
entrainment section and a diffuser that is substantially 
longer than the entrainment section and extends along the 
intake port to terminate close to the back of the intake 
valve. To inject enough external air to ensure complete fuel 
vaporisation would interfere significantly with the engine 
speed control, especially at idle. The present invention 
relies on a known device, a fluidic ejector sometimes also 
termed a jet pump, to amplify a small external air flow. 
The energy in the external air jet is used to entrain a 
large volume of air flow through the ejector causing an 
internal air recirculation within the intake port. A jet pump or fluidic ejector consists of three parts. The 
first is the supply nozzle which provides the kinetic energy 
for initiating the mass air flow. The second is a mixing 
tube or entrainment section. This section comprises an 
elongate tube wider than the supply jet which is aligned 
with but spaced from the supply jet. The mixing tube widens 
gradually into a conical diffuser section. The jet flowing 
in the mixing tube causes entrainment of

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine having an intake valve 
(12), an injector (40) for directing a metered jet or spray 

of fuel into the intake port and means for directing a jet 
of air at the back of the intake valve to assist in 

vaporisation of any fuel collecting in the intake port, 
whereby the means for directing a jet of air 

comprises a fluidic ejector (32) formed of an external air 
supply jet (22), an entrainment section (24) and a diffuser 

(26) that is substantially longer than the entrainment 
section and extends along the intake port to terminate close 

to the back of the intake valve (12). 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the fuel jet or spray from the fuel injector (40) is 

directed along the centre of the entrainment section (24) 
and diffuser (26) of the fluidic ejector (32). 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the fuel jet or spray from the fuel injector (40) is 

introduced through the supply jet (22) of the fluidic 
ejector (32). 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 2 or 
claim 3, wherein the ejector (32) is heated. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any 
preceding claim, wherein the air for the supply jet (22) of 

the fluidic ejector is drawn in by the manifold vacuum. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the air for the supply jet of the 

fluidic ejector is supplied under pressure by a compressor 
drawing air in from a position in the intake manifold 

downstream from the intake throttle but far removed from the 
intake port.
