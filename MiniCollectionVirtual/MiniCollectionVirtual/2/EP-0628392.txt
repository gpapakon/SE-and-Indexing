<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin structure having a high 
mechanical strength obtained by the reinforcement with 
long fibers, and an efficient economical process for 
producing it. It is known to incorporate reinforcement fibers 
such as glass fibers into a thermoplastic resin in 
order to improve the strength and rigidity of the 
resin. Usually a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin 
is produced by blending a thermoplastic resin with 
short fibers such as a chopped strand and extruding 
the blend on an extruder. However, the improvement in 
the mechanical strength is naturally limited, since 
the fibers used are short and, in such a short fiber-reinforced 
resin, the breakage of the fibers is 
unavoidable during the kneading in the extruder. It 
is thus impossible to satisfy the requirement of a 
further improvement in the mechanical strength. Recently, the pultrusion attracts attention as a  
 
process for producing a long fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin without breaking the fibers by 
overcoming the above-described defect (see the 
specifications of U.S. Patent Nos. 2877501, 4439387 
and 3022210, and the Official Gazette of Japanese 
Patent Publication-A No. 57-181852). In the pultrusion, an assembly of fiber bundles 
(a rove of fiber bundles), which is prepared by 
treating a lot of single-fibers from a bushing with an 
aqueous solution or aqueous emulsion of a sizing 
agent, bundling them, rolling them round a reel to 
form a cylindrical roll and drying the roll, are 
usually used as the reinforcing fibers. However, in the preparation of the long fiber-containing 
thermoplastic molding materials by 
extrusion-coating continuous fibers with a molten 
resin, the operation had to be suspended when the rove 
of fiber bundles had been consumed and started again 
after setting another rove thereof, since the entire 
length of the fiber bundle in each rove was limited. 
Thus much time was taken for the suspension and 
setting up. After extensive investigations made for the 
purpose of solving the above-described problem, the  
 
present inventors have found that the continuous 
feeding of the fiber bundles is technically possible 
by sufficiently firmly joining the final end of the 
rove of fiver bundles consumed to the beginning end of 
another rove thereof. The present invention has been 
completed on the basis of this finding. Namely, the present invention relates to a 
process for preparing a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic 
resin structure characterized
