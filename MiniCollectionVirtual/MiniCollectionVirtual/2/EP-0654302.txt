<ABSTRACT>
Improved double metal cyanide catalysts are disclosed. 
The substantially amorphous catalysts of the invention are 

more active for polymerizing epoxides than conventional DMC 
catalysts, which have a substantial crystalline component. 

Polyol products made with the catalysts are unusually 
clear, have exceptionally low unsaturations, and contain no 

detectable amount of low molecular weight polyol 
impurities. A method of making the improved DMC catalysts, 

which involves intimately combining the reactants, is also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to double metal cyanide (DMC)
complex catalyst compositions. The catalysts are highly
active in epoxide polymerizations. The specification includes
a method for preparing the compositions.
Polyether polyol products made using the catalyst
compositions have exceptionally low unsaturations.Double metal cyanide complex compounds are well known
catalysts for epoxide polymerization. The catalysts are
highly active, and give polyether polyols that have low
unsaturation compared with similar polyols made using basic
(KOH) catalysis. Conventional DMC catalysts are prepared
by reacting aqueous solutions of metal salts and metal
cyanide salts to form a precipitate of the DMC compound.
The catalysts can be used to make a variety of polymer
products, including polyether, polyester, and
polyetherester polyols. Many of the polyols are useful in
various polyurethane coatings, elastomers, sealants, foams,
and adhesives.Conventional DMC catalysts are usually prepared in the
presence of a low molecular weight complexing agent,
typically an ether such as glyme (dimethoxy-ethane) or
diglyme. The ether complexes with the DMC compound, and
favorably impacts the activity of the catalyst for epoxide
polymerization. In one conventional preparation, aqueous
solutions of zinc chloride (excess) and potassium 
hexacyanocobaltate are combined by simple mixing. The
resulting precipitate of zinc hexacyanocobaltate is then
mixed with aqueous glyme. An active catalyst is obtained
that has the formula:
Zn3[Co(CN)6]2 · xZnCl2 · yH2O · zGlymeOther known complexing agents include alcohols,
ketones, esters, amides, ureas. (See, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,427,256, 3,427,334, 3,278,459,
and Japanese Pat. Appl. Kokai Nos. 4-145123, 3-281529 and
3-149222). Generally, the catalyst made with glyme has
been the catalyst of choice. The catalysts have relatively
high surface areas, typically within the range of about 50-200m2/g.
Thus, EPA 0555053 discloses double metal cyanide
complex catalysts suitable for use in ring-opening polymerization
reactions are prepared in filterable form by adding an aqueous
solution of a stoichiometric excess of a first metal salt to an
aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanometallate while
maintaining the temperature of the latter in the range of 30°C
to 75°C, and arranging for either or both of the solutions to
contain a water-miscible heteroatom-containing organic ligand or
for the slurry obtained by combining the solutions to be
contacted with such an organic ligand.Double metal cyanide
