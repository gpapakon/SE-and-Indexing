<ABSTRACT>
In connection with a method for supply of air and operating means to a vessel which is located at a great depth, there are provided one or more pump stations (1) at suitable distances between the surface and the vessel. The pump stations (1) can be equipped with means for balancing to the water depth and pumps and possibly other means for transporting air and operating means to the next station or vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for supplying air and operating 
means to a vessel located at a great depth and a device for 
balancing a vessel in water, e.g. a salvage dock, barge, 
submarine, pump stations, subsea devices etc. The ascent and descent of a vessel 
at great depths entails major problems with regard to 
air supply. Due to the considerable difference in pressure 
between the surface and the depth concerned, it will be necessary 
to bring along large quantities of air. When manoeuvering 
a vessel in water it can be difficult to achieve a stable 
descent and ascent, due, amongst other factors, to possible 
bias, erratic air supply, etc. Thus it is desirable to provide a device for balancing and 
positioning of vessels in water which, e.g., are biased and to 
provide a device for further transport of air down 
to the depth concerned. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a device 
for supply of air and operating means to a vessel, wherein the 
device enables the air supply to be replenished, thus avoiding 
the transport of large quantities of air on board the vessel. 
A further object, especially during the employment of such a 
method, is to provide a device for balancing, submerging and 
positioning of such a vessel in water. The object of the present invention is achieved by 
a device according to claim 1. 
A special object of the device is obtained when a compressed air 
supply is provided which is connected to a service tank with an  
 
overpressure chamber. Further features are obtained by means of 
the sub-claims. The invention will now be described in more detail by means of 
an embodiment which is illustrated by means of the drawing. The 
drawing comprises the following: 
Fig. 1 is a cross section of a pump station according to 
the invention, fig. 2 is a cross section of a pressure supply according 
to the invention, fig. 3 illustrates pump stations provided between a 
surface vessel and a submerged vessel, fig. 4 is a schematic representation of the principles of the 
invention used for controlling the ascent and descent of a vessel, 
balancing the vessel independently of depth and supplying air. Fig. 1 of the drawing shows a pump station 1 with a ballast 
chamber 2. Through the pump station 1 there are passed means 3, 
e.g. connection elements for cables or air input 16. The pump 
station 1 comprises an electrical compressor 4, which is 
controlled by an adjustable pressure sensor 8 which maintains a 
desired exit pressure 12, e.g. at 500m, of approximately 55 
bar,

<CLAIMS>
A device for supplying air and operating means directly 
from a surface location to a vessel which is located at a great 

depth, e.g. at 500 m, or more, beyond the surface level, 
characterized in that from a surface location to site at a 

great depth there are provided one or more pump stations (1) at 
suitable distances in a cable or a pipe between the surface and 

the vessel at the great depth, and that the pump stations (1) 
are equipped with means for balancing to water depth and pumps 

and possibly other means for transporting air and operating 
means to the next station or vessel, in that at the same level 

as the vessel there are provided a station with the same 
function as the pump stations to establish necessary working 

pressure. 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the pump station (1) comprises cooling 

devices (13, 14) for, e.g., air and oil, that the pump station 
(1) comprises control means consisting of, amongst other 

things, a control centre (15), a signal transmitter and a 
receiver (18), and that it comprises pumps (7) and/or operating 

means for propellers (17). 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the pumpstations (1) and the device for 

supplying air and operation means to the vessel at the great 
depth, respectively, comprises a compressed air supply (29) or 

surface air supply (39), connected to a service tank (30) with 
an overpressure chamber (31), that there is provided a 

compressor (33) between the supply (29) or the surface air 
supply (39) and the service tank (30), that buoyancy tank(s) 

(28) with overpressure sensors (34) are connected to the 
device, and that the overpressure sensors (34) are designed to 

control the pressure difference between an internal pressure in 
the buoyancy tank(s) (28) and an ambient water pressure.  

 
A device according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the compressed air supply (29) is a 

bottle element (19), preferably with a pressure-actuated bottom 
(20).  

 
A device according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the service tank (30) has an overpressure 

of approximately 50 bar in relation to the ambient pressure. 
A device according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that there is provided a compressor (33) in 

order to maintain the pressure in the service tank (30).

which is opened both during ascent and descent. 
A device according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that the overpressure chamber (31) has a two-way 

valve (32), which independently of the depth automatically
