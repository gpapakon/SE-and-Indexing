<ABSTRACT>
An intravascular stent especially suited for
implanting in curved arterial portions or ostial regions.

The stent can include an end region which is fabricated
to have a greater radial strength than the remaining

axial length of the stent. Such a stent is particularly
suited for use in ostial regions, which require greater

support near the end of the stent. The stent
alternatively can include sections adjacent the end of

the stent with greater bending flexibility than the
remaining axial length of the stent. Such a stent is

particularly suited for use in curved arteries. The
stent can also be constructed with an end that has

greater radial strength and sections adjacent the end
with greater bending flexibility. Such a stent prevents

flaring of the stent end during insertion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to stents for implanting into a living body.
In particular, the present invention relates to intraluminal stents especially suited
for implanting in a variety of lumens having variable characteristics, such as variable
curvature, side branching, variable diameter, variable wall compliance or
"end effects" of either the lumen, as found, e.g., in ostia, or the stent as the parameters
may change at its ends.It is well known to use a stent to expand and impart support to different bodily
conduits, such as blood vessels, by expanding a tube-like structure inside the vessel
requiring support against collapse or closure. U.S. Patent No. 5,449,373 shows
a stent preferably used for vascular implantation as part of a balloon angioplasty
procedure. The stent of U.S. Patent No. 5,449,373 may be delivered through, or
implanted in, a curved vessel. One shortcoming of conventional stents is that they
may have deficiencies due to "end effects" where the ends of the stent tend to
"flare out" during insertion or after expansion or have a decreased radial force at
the end. Still another shortcoming of conventional stents is they do not have different
characteristics, (e.g., flexibility and rigidity), to accommodate any changing
characteristics of the section of the lumen requiring different stent characteristics. WO 96/26689 discloses a segmented articulatable stent of open structure comprised
of end-connected struts making up the segments with angular interconnects
between segments.EP-A-0 800 801 which is a prior art document according to Art. 54(3) EPC for
some of the designated states, discloses an expandable stent for implanting in a
body lumen which has an open lattice structure and is constructed so that at least
one end section has a thicker cross-section and corresponding greater radial
strength than the remaining sections of the stent.It is an object of this invention to provide a stent which does not have sharp points
or protrusions at its end concentrating pressure on the vessel's wall upon expansion
of the stent in a curved portion of a vessel while having a radial force at its
distal end that is greater than the radial force in the portion of the stent proximal to
the distal end.This object and other objects are achieved according to the invention by a stent as
defined in independent claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are depicted in the
dependent claims.The present invention provides for various embodiments of an intraluminal stent
which includes varied or different
