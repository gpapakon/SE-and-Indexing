<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for image processing in which 
certain processes are carried out by sorting plural labeled 

images (A1 - A8) and specifying any one or plural of the 
sorted labeled images. Respective labeled images are 

divided into groups by their positional relations (for 
example, the positional relations in the direction of Y 

axis). And respective labeled images belonging to each 
group are sorted within the group by the respective 

positions (for example, X coordinates of the centers of 
gravity (g₁ - g₈)).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for image 
processing and an apparatus thereof, which sorts a 
plurality of labeled images and carries out certain 
processes by specifying any labeled images which are 
sorted. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a method and an apparatus for sorting plural labeled 
images which are labeled differently so as to specify 
exactly aimed labeled images. When plural objects are included in the visual field 
of a TV camera, the image obtained by taking a picture 
image is subjected to binarization and converted to a 
binary image, and the binary image is subjected to the 
labelling process to extract and label the image areas of 
the respective objects. Furthermore, the respective image 
areas extracted by labelling, that is, the labeled images 
are sorted by feature parameters of the respective images 
such as areas or the coordinates on centers of gravity, and 
a specified labeled image is designated to carry out a 
process for recognition. Fig. 11 (1) and (2) show one embodiment of sorting by 
areas conventionally.  Fig. 11 (1) shows an image 20 obtained by taking a 
picture image of the characters, and three of the same 
character "A" having different areas are in a row. The 
image 20 of these characters is raster-scanned as shown by 
arrows in the drawing to extract labeled image a1, a2 and 
a3 of the characters. The respective labeled images a1, a2 
and a3 are labeled in the order of extraction. In the 
embodiment shown in the drawing, the character in the 
center having the largest area are labeled L1, the 
character on the left having the smallest area is labeled 
L2, and the character on the right having a middle-sized 
area is labeled L3. After this labelling process, the feature parameters 
of labeled images a1 - a3 are measured and stored in 
predetermined storage areas in RAM. At this time, the 
feature parameter of the labeled image a2 which is labeled 
L1, is stored to the storage area relating to label L1 in 
RAM, the feature parameter of the labeled image a1 which is 
labeled L2, is stored to the storage area relating to label 
L2, and the feature parameter of the labeled image a3 which 
is labeled L3, is stored in the storage area relating to 
label L3, in sequence. Next, these labeled images a1, a2 and a3 are sorted by 
areas. The sorting mentioned here means a rearranging of 
the data in RAM so that the feature parameters of the  
 
labeled image a2 having the largest area, the feature 
parameters of the labeled image a3 having
