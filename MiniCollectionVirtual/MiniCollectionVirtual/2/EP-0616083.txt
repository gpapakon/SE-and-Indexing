<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and installation for excavating a bed (9) which is 
located underwater with the aid of a bucket dredger (1) provided with bucket-like scoop 

elements (2). The scoop elements are provided with venting means (10) to remove the 
air therefrom before scooping. Removal of the air preferably takes place as the scoop 

element (2) is being brought into the water. The venting means (10) are arranged on the 
bucket base and/or bucket wall(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for excavating a bed which is located 
underwater with the aid of a dredger installation, such as a bucket dredger, provided 
with at least one bucket-like scoop element, with which method the scoop element is, 
successively, introduced into the water, filled underwater with spoil, brought back above 
water filled with spoil and emptied above water. A method of this type is generally known and has the great advantage that, 
by this means, a uniform, flat and accurate bottom profile can be obtained, and that 
bulky refuse causes little inconvenience to a bucket dredger which has bucket-like 
scoop elements. However, when a bucket dredger is used, the buckets cause the water to 
become very cloudy because, inter alia, fine soil particles are brought into suspension, 
which particles then disperse through the water and settle again elsewhere. This is 
undesirable when dredging sludge contaminated with heavy metals and other hazardous 
substances, since pollutants have the tendency to adhere to fine soil particles in 
particular and will therefore disperse through the water when this is clouded. For the above reasons, when contaminated sludge is dredged, in practice it is 
not bucket dredgers which are used, but suction dredgers or grab dredgers, which in 
theory should cause little turbidity. Suction dredgers have the disadvantage that, because 
water is sucked up as well, a large volume has to be dealt with, that bulky refuse can 
cause the suction device to seize or malfunction and that the accuracy and flatness of 
the bottom profile obtained leaves something to be desired. With grab dredgers too it is 
very difficult to obtain an accurate and flat bottom profile and where there is bulky 
refuse, such as a block of wood, the jaws do not always close completely, with the 
result that spoil, such as sludge, can flow out of the jaws and the contamination can 
disperse. US-A-3,736,677 discloses a scraper which is pulled by a vessel and has a 
top wall, side walls and a rear wall but no front wall or bottom wall. The front and base 
are thus open. This scraper is intended to 
a) drag sludge over the bottom to the bank and dump it on the bank or  
 b) to bring sludge into motion and thus to suspend it in the water, after which the 
current carries away the suspended sludge.  
Holes are made at the rear of the scraper in the rear wall and top wall, so that water 
displaced by sludge scraped up by the scraper can escape from the latter. DE-A-2,417,545 discloses a conveyor

Method for excavating a bed which is located underwater with the aid of 
a dredger installation, such as a bucket dredger (1), provided with at least one bucket-like 

scoop element (2), with which method the scoop element (2) is, successively, 
introduced into the water, filled under water with spoil, brought back above water filled 

with spoil and emptied above water, 
characterised in that
 air is removed by a venting 
device from the bucket-like scoop element (2) before said scoop element (2) is filled 

with spoil. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein the bucket-like scoop element (2) 
is brought into the water with its scoop opening (22) essentially facing downwards, 


characterised in that
 the removal of air essentially takes place as the scoop is being 
brought into the water. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the venting 
device is opened during discharge of the bucket-like scoop element. 
Bucket dredger for carrying out the method according to claim 1 or 2 or 3 
comprising an endless conveyor (3) provided with at least one bucket-like scoop 

element (2) having a bucket base (23), a scoop opening (22) and a wall (44), 

characterised in that
 a venting device (10) is arrangcd at thc bucket base (23) and/or 
bucket wall (44) of the scoop element (2). 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the venting 
device (10) comprises a housing (11) attached to the bucket base (23) and/or bucket 

wall (44), with a shut-off element (18) arranged in the chamber (24) formed in the 
housing (11), inlet means (13) and an outlet orifice (12) which can be closed by the 

shut-off element (18). 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the shut-off 
element (18) is arranged in the chamber (24) so that it is freely movable and in that the 

specific gravity of the shut-off element (18) is essentially higher than that of water, the 
outlet orifice (12) essentially facing away from the scoop opening (22) of the scoop 

element (2). 
Bucket dredger according to either of Claims 5 and 6, 
characterised in 
that
 the shut-off element (18) comprises an essentially spherical body and in that the 
chamber (24) is essentially tapered towards the outlet orifice (12) and at the outlet  

 
orifice terminates in a curvature (20) which faces outwards with respect to the chamber. 
Bucket dredger according to one of Claims 5 - 7, 
characterised in that
 the 
shut-off element (18) is covered with an elastic material (19), such as rubber. 
Bucket dredger according to one of Claims 5 - 8, 
characterised in that
 the 
inlet means (13) comprise an inlet orifice (26) and a plate (14) which is movable 

backwards and forwards along a guide (15), said plate (14) being movable between a 
position which closes the inlet orifice and a position which exposes the inlet orifice. 
Bucket dredger according to one of Claims 4 - 9, 
characterised in that
 
the venting device closes and opens automatically under the influence of gravity, the 

venting device being opened when the scoop element moves downwards and closed

the bucket dredger comprises a ladder (6) having an excavating end (4) and a discharge 

end, in which the at least one bucket-like scoop element is fixed to an endless chain 
running around the ladder, and in which the venting device opens automatically under 

the influence of gravity when the scoop element turns around the discharge end, and in 
which the venting device closes automatically when the scoop element turns around the 

excavating end.
