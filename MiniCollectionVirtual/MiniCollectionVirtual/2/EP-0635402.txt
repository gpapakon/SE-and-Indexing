<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an air bag inflation gas generator 
comprising an inner cylindrical member (47) with gas flow openings 

(49) formed in the outer periphery being inserted into a longitudinal 
bottom-closed outer cylindrical member (35) with gas outlets (41) formed 

in the outer periphery with a filter (45) disposed therebetween and 
gas generating agents (57) being accommodated in the inner cylindrical 

member (47), wherein mating sections (97) are disposed at the open end of 
the inner cylindrical member (47) so as to engage with other mating 

sections (93) formed at the bottom of the outer cylindrical member (35), 
so that the position of the gas flow openings (49) formed in the inner 

cylindrical member (47) and the position of the gas outlets (41) 
formed in 

the outer cylindrical member (35) can be easily and surely set in a 
predetermined positional relation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to air bag inflation gas generator according to the preamble of claim 1.
Such air bag inflation gas generators are used to feed combustion gas for inflation of air
bags such as air bags for absorbing collision shocks, life jackets, rafts, and escape chutes.A prior shock absorber to protect a passenger car driver from shocks at collision accidents
comprises an air bag and a gas generator to inflate the air bag with gas. At a collision
accident of a passenger car, explosives or other gas generating agents having a similar
composition thereto, which are charged in the gas generator, are ignited and burnt to
produce gas. The air bag is instantaneously inflated by the resultant gas for protecting the
driver against any collision shocks, thereby avoiding possible serious injury of the driver.An air bag inflation gas generator according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from JP-A-5
138 005 and shown in Fig. 9. This air bag inflation gas generator comprises a
longitudinal outer cylindrical member 13 having a plurality of gas outlets 11 formed in the
outer periphery, an inner cylindrical member 17 inserted in the outer cylindrical member 13
and having gas flow openings 15 formed in the outer periphery, a final filter 19 disposed
between the outer cylindrical member 13 and the inner cylindrical member 17, a plurality of
gas generating agents 23 with a through hole 21 formed at the center accommodated in the
stacked state in the axial direction of the inner cylindrical member 17, and an igniter 25 and
an ignition agent 27 disposed at one end of the inner cylindrical member 17, wherein the gas
generating agents 23 and the ignition agent 27 are accommodated in a gas generating agent
pack 29.With the above air bag inflation gas generator, volume of combustion gas from the gas
generating agents 23 can be steeply increased and a large volume of combustion gas can be
surely purified. But, in the above conventional air bag inflation gas generator, since the end of the inner
cylindrical member 17 is merely inserted into a hole 13b formed at a bottom 13a of the
outer cylindrical member 13, it is difficult to set easily and surely the position of the gas
flow openings 15 formed keeping certain positional relation in the inner cylindrical member
17 and the position of the gas outlets 11 formed keeping certain positional relation in the
outer cylindrical member 13 in the predetermined positional relation. And, there is a
problem that it is difficult to let the combustion gas from the gas generating

<CLAIMS>
An air bag inflation gas generator, comprising:

a longitudinal bottom-closed outer cylindrical member (35) with gas outlets (41)
formed in the outer periphery,
an inner cylindrical member (47) with gas flow openings (49) formed in the outer
periphery, said inner cylindrical member (47) being inserted into the outer cylindrical

member (35),
a filter (45) disposed therebetween,
gas generating agents (57) being accommodated in the inner cylindrical member (47),
characterized in that
first engaging means comprising at least one projecting portion (95) is formed at the
bottom of the outer cylindrical member (35), and
second engaging means comprising at least one recess (97, 99) is disposed at the open
end of the inner cylindrical member (47), so as to mate with the first engaging means

(95) when the inner cylindrical member (47) is inserted into the outer cylindrical
member (35) in order to avoid any rotational movement of the inner cylindrical member

(47) relative to the outer cylindrical member (35).
Gas generator according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the recess (97) tightly
accommodates the projecting portion (95) when the inner cylindrical member (47) is

inserted into the outer cylindrical member (35).
Gas generator according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the outer cylindrical
member (35) is provided with two projecting portions (95) diagonally opposing each

other, and the inner cylindrical member (47) is provided with two recesses (97) also
diagonally opposing each other, such that the projecting portions (95) and the recesses

(97) encompass an angle of 180 , respectively. 
Gas generator according to one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 the
second engaging means (97) are formed at both ends of the inner cylindrical member

(47).
Gas generator according to one of the foregoing claims, 
characterized in that
 a hole
(93) in which the end of the inner cylindrical member (47) is inserted, is formed in the

bottom of the outer cylindrical member (35), each first engaging mean (95) is disposed
