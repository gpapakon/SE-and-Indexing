<CLAIMS>
Spinning machine (1) comprising a machine frame 
(10), a spindle (2), a spinning tool (4) attached to 

a front end (21) of the spindle (2), a holder-up (6) 
for a work-piece (9) put onto the spinning tool (4) 

with the holder-up axially to be traversed in alignment 
with the spindle (2), and at least two rotatable 

spinning rollers (7) to be advanced in the 
radial direction (79) of the spindle, and guided in 

the machine frame (10), wherein for accomplishing a 
spinning operation the spindle (2) together with the 

holder-up (6) is to be traversed in the axial direction 
of the spindle in relation to the machine frame 

(10), and the spinning rollers (7), wherein a work-piece 
stripper (8) is provided which is freely displaceable 

by the spindle (2) in parallel with the 
spindle while guided at the machine frame (10), and 

wherein the displacement distance (1) of the work-piece 
stripper (8) in the return direction of the 

spindle (2) is limited such, that the displacement 
distance (1) of the work-piece stripper (8) is 

smaller than the displacement distance (L) of the 
spindle (2),
characterized in,
that the spindle (2) is rotatable by means of a 
rotary drive (3), 
that for accomplishing a spinning operation the 
spindle (2) together with the rotary drive (3) 

thereof is to be traversed in the axial direction  
 

of the spindle, 
that the work-piece stripper (8) is forked with at 
least two stripping fingers (85, 85'), and 
that the stripping fingers (85, 85') comprise an 
articulated and/or elastic support for balancing 

asymmetries between the respective contact areas 
of the work-piece (9) and the stripping fingers 

(85, 85'). 
Spinning machine according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the rotary drive (3) is connected with the 

spindle (2) by means of transfer means (22, 32, 33) 
which are arranged at the front end (21) of the 

spindle (2) where also the spinning tool (4) is 
attached. 
Spinning machine according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the rotary drive (3) is an electric motor 

(3'), and that the transfer means consist of two 
pulleys (22, 32), and a multiple or poly-V-belt 

transmission (33). 
Spinning machine according to one of the claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that centered in the spindle 

(2), and the spinning tool (4) a work-piece ejector 
(5) is provided with the work-piece ejector axially 

to be traversed in relation to the spindle, and the 
spinning tool. 
Spinning machine according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the work-piece ejector (5) at the front end 

thereof abutting at the front end (21) of the spinning 
tool (4) comprises connecting means (51) for 

the centered attachment of additional tool parts 
(40) or measuring devices (40').  

 
Spinning machine according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the additional tool part (40) is a work-piece 

centering insert. 
Spinning machine according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the measuring device (40') comprises a measuring 

head (45), and a sensor (46) in the form of a 
finger or a disk, and that particularly progressions 

of spinning roller contours in relation to the spinning 
tool (4) are measurable therewith.
