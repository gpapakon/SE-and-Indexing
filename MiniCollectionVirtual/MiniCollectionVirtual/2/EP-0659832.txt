<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
thermosetting compounds which hardly generate volatile by-products
on curing, cured products thereof and a method
for manufacturing the thermosetting compounds.Thermosetting resins, such as phenolic resins,
melamine resins, epoxy resins, unsaturated polyester
resins and bis-maleimide resins, are widely used in many
industrial fields due to the heat resistance originated
from their thermosetting property and to their
reliability. These resins however suffer their
respective disadvantages, for example, the generation of
volatile by-products on curing of phenolic resins or
melamine resins, the poor inflamability of epoxy resins
and unsaturated polyester resins and the extremely high
price of bis-maleimide resins, and, in practical use, such
disadvantages have unavoidably been tolerated depending on
their uses. To solve this problem, there have been made
attempts to develop novel thermosetting resins free from
such disadvantages.One of the attempts resulted in the development
of dihydrobenzoxazine compounds (refer to the
specification of Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication
No. 49-47378 and the specification of U.S. Patent No.
5,152,939). The compounds are cured by the ring-opening
polymerization of the benzoxazine rings, to cause little
generation of volatile matters on thermosetting.However, the curing reaction brings about not so 
long extension of molecular chains (Polym. Sci. Technol.,
31, p.27-49, 1985) and inadequate density of
cross-linking, so that softening or thermal deterioration
occurs over 200 °C.It is also known that the ring-opening
polymerization takes disadvantageously longer curing time
as compared with the curing reaction of conventional
phenolic resins, resulting in low productivity that limits
the industrial use of the compounds.FR-A-2 189 455 relates to a polymerizable and/or
hardenable product, which contains 1,3-oxazatetraline(s) and/or prepolymer (s) thereof.The present invention is to overcome the above
described problems and to provide a thermosetting compound
which is characterized in containing, per molecule, at
least one structural unit represented by the formula (A)
and at least one structural unit represented by the
formula (B) in a (A)/(B) molar ratio of 1/0.25 to 1/9,
said structural units being bonded directly or via at
least one organic group with one another;

wherein R1 is a methyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a
nonsubstituted phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted 
with at least one substituent, and each hydrogen atom on
