<ABSTRACT>
A fibre laser (2) is used in data-recordal, such as dye diffusion thermal transfer printing. The fibre laser output (3) is modulated and scanned across a recording medium (4) of adjacent dye donor and receiver ribbons by a modulator (20) and galvanometer (16), so that an image is produced line-by-line in the medium (4) as it passes between spools (19). The fibre laser (2) may comprise a single-mode, neodymium-doped lasing core (5), a multimode pump core (6), an outer cladding (7), and a dichroic mirror (8) at each end, and may be pumped by beams (10) from laser diodes (9) coupled to the pump core (6) by optical fibres (11) and a lens (14). Instead of using a galvanometer (16), the output end of the fibre laser (2) may be moved itself across the recording medium (4), and/or a plurality of the fibre lasers (2) may be bundled together in a one or two dimensional array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and 
apparatus for data-recordal (which term includes 
printing) using a laser beam, and relates especially, 
though not exclusively, to dye thermal transfer 
printing. In dye thermal transfer printing, heat is applied 
to selected pixel areas of a dyesheet to cause dye to 
transfer to an adjacent dye receiver sheet to form a 
print. Print speed is determined by the dye transfer rate 
which depends on the power of the heat source, and print 
resolution is determined by the spot size to which the 
source is able to be focused. For high speed and high 
resolution printing, therefore, a source of high 
radiance is required, and lasers have proved attractive. Many different laser sources have been used, each 
having their own particular problems. For example, 
Nd:YAG lasers pumped by arc lamps suffer from being 
large, expensive, and inefficient, and require regular 
maintenance due to the short life of the lamps. 
Replacing the arc lamps by arrays of laser diodes can 
improve the size and performance of such lasers, but 
they remain expensive and somewhat inefficient. Laser diodes may also be used as sources 
themselves, but produce highly divergent and 
asymmetrical beams of relatively low radiance. 
Such a printer is e.g. disclosed in document EP-A-0 060 641. The present invention aims to provide data-recordal 
apparatus having an alternative and advantageous laser 
source to those provided to date, and, from a first 
aspect, provides apparatus in which data-recordal is 
effected by a laser beam, wherein a fibre laser is 
provided as a laser beam source. A fibre laser comprises, in essence, an optical  
 
fibre whose core (normally silica) is doped by a 
material suitable for causing lasing action (normally a 
rare earth metal, such as neodymium or erbium), and in 
which a resonant cavity is produced by, for example, 
providing dichroic mirrors at the fibre input and output 
ends to provide feedback-gain at the lasing wavelengths, 
whilst allowing pump light to be launched into the fibre 
input end and laser light to be emitted from the output 
end. As discussed in more detail below, the preferred 
form of the fibre laser is of a dual core type having an 
inner lasing core surrounded by a pump core which, in 
turn, is surrounded by an outer cladding. Preferably, 
the lasing core is doped with neodymium. The fibre laser may be pumped by any convenient 
source, such as a laser diode or laser diode array, 
which may be end-coupled to the fibre laser by 
intermediate
