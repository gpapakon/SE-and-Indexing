<ABSTRACT>
A support stay (16) for use with an article to be worn by 
a person has two durometers of hardness. The support 

stay includes a base member (16a) having a first hardness, the 
first hardness sufficient to provide a required rigidity 

for support. A gripping member (16b) is operatively connected 
to the base member and has attachment areas which extend 

beyond the ends of the base member. The gripping member 
has a second hardness which is softer than the first 

hardness. The gripping member, when attached to the 
inner surface of the article by attachment areas, 

provides a non-slip surface against the person wearing 
the article to keep the article in position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention related generally to support stays 
and more particularly to a dual durometer support stay 
for use with an article to be worn by a person. Support stays have been utilized in a variety of 
articles, such as wrist supports, ankle braces, and back 
supports, as well as many other similar and related 
products. The function of the support has been to 
provide added rigidity for the article with which it is 
used. These stays have been made from a variety of 
materials. In addition to providing rigidity, for certain 
articles, it is important to maintain the article being 
worn in a certain position on the wearer's body. One 
example of such a product is a back support, such as 
those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,040,524 and 
5,148,549. In those back supports, the stays are 
enclosed in a pocket. In addition, in certain 
embodiments, these back supports have a material which 
has a rubber texture over the stay pockets so that the 
support will stay in position on the wearer. It can be 
seen that the stays have two functional and performance 
characteristics. The first is that the stainless steel 
stays give vertical spinal support and prevents the back 
support from gathering and "rolling over" as the support 
moves around the body. The second is the grabbing or 
anti-skid properties of the rubber material over the 
stay pockets. This grabbing or gripping inhibits the 
back supports from "riding up" on the body and 
improperly supporting the vulnerable regions of the 
abdomen and lower back. While this has proven to be an 
effective back support, there are certain problems which 
are associated with a stay being incorporated in the 
back support in such a manner. Since a pocket for the  
 
stay is used, the stay can slide freely within the 
pocket. This movement can lead to problems. These 
problems include that the metal stays may poke through 
the pocket in which they are positioned and also the 
movement may cut the rubber threads in the rubber 
material. Another problem is that the rubber threads 
may become frayed. Still further, there are multiple 
components which add additional cost and time in the 
manufacturing of the back support. In addition, when 
metal supports are utilized, they also make the back 
support conductive of electricity. The present invention addresses the drawbacks of the 
prior art and provides for an improved support stay 
which may be incorporated in articles to be worn by a 
person. The invention is a support stay for use with an 
article to be worn by a

<CLAIMS>
A support stay for use with an article to be 
worn by a person, the article having an outer surface 

and an inner surface, the inner surface proximate the 
person when worn, the stay comprising: 


(a) a base member having a first hardness, 
said first hardness sufficient to provide a required 

rigidity for providing support; 
(b) a gripping member operatively connected to 
said base member; 
(c) said gripping member having a second 
hardness which is softer than said first hardness; 

and 
(d) said gripping member, when attached to the 
inner surface of the article, provides a non-slip 

surface against the person wearing the article to 
keep the article in position. 
The stay of claim 1, further comprising said 
gripping member having a durometer of from 55 to 73, 

Shore A scale and said base member having a durometer of 
from 65 to 85 Rockwell hardness. 
The support stay of claim 1, further comprising 
said base member and said gripping member are co-extruded 

plastic members as an integral one-piece unit. 
The support stay of claim 3, further comprising 
said base member is polypropylene and said gripping 

member is a mixture of polypropylene and rubber. 
The support stay of claim 1, further comprising 
said base member having a generally curved cross-section 

and a plurality of ribs operatively connected to said 
base member for added rigidity. 
The support stay of claim 1, further comprising 
a gripping enhancement means operatively connected to 

said gripping member. 
The support stay of claim 1, wherein said 
gripping member is sized to extend beyond said base 

member, thereby forming an attachment area including 
 

only the gripping member, wherein said attachment area 
may be used to secure said stay to an article to be 

worn. 
A back support for providing abdominal and 
lumbosacral support as needed by the wearer, comprising: 


(d) a support stay operatively connected to 
said waistband and positioned on said inner surface, 

comprising: 

(i) a base member having a first 
hardness, said first hardness sufficient to 

provide a required rigidity for providing 
support; 
(ii) a gripping member operatively 
connected to said base member; 
(iii) said gripping member having a 
second hardness which is softer than said first 

hardness; and 
(iv) said gripping member provides a non-slip 
surface against the person wearing the 

back support to keep the back support in 
position. 
The back support of claim 8, further comprising 
said gripping member having a durometer of from 55 to 

73, Shore A scale and said base member having a

gripping member is a mixture of polypropylene and 
rubber. 
The back support of claim 8, further comprising 
said base member having a generally curved cross-section
