<ABSTRACT>
Thermosetting powder coating compositions are produced based on a low molecular weight glycidyl functional copolymer produced by solvent polymerization of ethylenic monomers in an organic solvent polymerization medium containing at least 15 % by weight organic solvent based on the weight of solvent and monomers copolymerized, where the ethylenic monomers copolymerized comprise on a weight basis between about 15 % and 35 % glycidyl methacrylate, between about 5 % and 60 % methyl methacrylate, between about 2 % and 15 % butyl methacrylate, and between about 5 % and 50 % styrene, to produce glycidyl functional copolymer having a melt viscosity between 150 and 400 poise and a Tg between 80  C and 100  C, where the copolymer is coreactive with carboxyl functional crosslinking compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to paint coatings
generally and particularly to clear and pigmented powder
paint coatings based on a thermosetting polymeric binder
comprising a glycidyl methacrylate modified functionally
reactive acrylic copolymer having a high glass transition
temperature (Tg) in conjunction with low molecular weight
and particularly exhibiting good storage stability and
film appearance.This invention pertains generally to protective
surface coatings commonly known as paint coatings.
Protective surface coatings are organic compositions
applied to substrates to form continuous films which are
cured or otherwise hardened to provide protection as well
as a decorative appearance to the substrates. Protective
surface coatings ordinarily comprise an organic polymeric
binder, pigments, inert fillers and other paint coating
additives. The polymeric binder functions as an organic
vehicle for the pigments, inerts, and other additives and
further functions as a binder for the pigments and inert
fillers in the cured or hardened paint film. Polymeric
binders can be thermosetting binders based on coreactive
binder components.Powder coatings are organic coatings in dry
powder form comprising essentially 100% non-volatile solids
and based on a polymeric film forming binder. Powder
coatings can be clear coatings without opacifying pigments
or pigmented coatings containing opacifying pigments.
Powder paints are finely pulverized polymeric compositions
in the form of dry free-flowing fine powder which melts and
flows at elevated temperatures to produce a smooth coated 
surface when applied to a substrate. Protective surface
coatings based on powder paints are particularly useful in
view of environmental compliance in that powder paints
ordinarily do not contain organic solvents or emit organic
compounds upon baking or heat curing.Thermosetting acrylic polymer based powder
coatings exhibit good exterior durability as well as
detergent and alkali resistance. Functionally reactive
acrylic copolymers can be cured or cross-linked with
crosslinkers such as aliphatic diacids to obtain good film
appearance. Acrylic powder coatings exhibit good surface
hardness and scratch resistance but generally are less
flexible than polyester powder coatings. To achieve a
good film appearance with acrylic powder coatings, the melt
viscosity of the acrylic copolymer binder must be low which
can be obtained by reducing the molecular weight or the
glass transition temperature (Tg) of the acrylic copolymer.
However, reducing one physical
