<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a harness arrangement for use with 
a seat, and in particular to a seat strap assembly and a 

means of adjusting the straps. The seat strap assembly (10) 
comprises a pair of straps (12, 13) that are each secured at 

their first end to the seat (14) at a first position with 
respect to the seat (14) so that they are secured to the seat 

(14) adjacent the shoulders of an occupant. The straps (12, 
13) extend to and through apertures (24, 26) in second 

positions of the seat (14) that are adjacent to and either 
side of the waist of the occupant. Coupling means (15) are 

located on each of the straps (12, 13) and connect together 
so that we they are positioned over the occupant and 

connected together the two straps (12, 13) extending between 
the said first ends and said coupling means (15) comprise 

shoulder straps (13), and portions of the two straps (12, 13) 
that extend between the coupling and said apertures comprise 

lap straps (12). An adjustment strap (28) is secured to the 
second end of each strap (12, 13) and locking means (29) on 

the seat (14) is provided for releasably securing the 
adjustment strap (28) so that the shoulder and lap straps 

(13, 12) may be loosened or tightened by changing the 
position of the adjustment strap (28) with respect to the 

locking means (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seat strap assembly 
comprising a pair of straps, that are each secured at their 
first ends to said seat, said straps having second ends 
extending to and through apertures in said seat, mutually 
inter-connectable coupling means on each one of said straps 
positioned so that they overlie said occupant when they 
connect together, an adjustment strap secured to the second 
end of each said strap, and locking means on said seat for 
releasably securing said adjustment strap so that said 
shoulder and lap straps may be loosened or tightened by 
changing the position of the adjustment strap with respect 
to said locking means. The invention will find many applications, but 
primarily has been designed for use with respect to moulded 
infant seats which can be located within motor vehicles. The use of such safety seats have become very 
widespread, and now in fact are required by law for infants 
of certain age ranges. Such safety seats normally comprise 
some form of harness or seat strap assembly which secures 
the infant to the seat. Harnesses generally comprise 
shoulder or sash straps, lap straps and a crutch strap. 
The strap portions are attached to a coupling means such as 
a conventional buckle which enables the harness to be 
assembled around and over an infant. In order to ensure that the infant is safely 
restrained within the seat, the harness must be properly 
adjusted, and it is generally an aim of such safety seats 
to ensure that the harness adjustment is as simple as 
possible. An example of such harness adjustment means is 
shown in Australian Patent No 503602 (AU-B-23568/77) which allows the 
adjustment of the harness to be effected through a single 
pull strap. The arrangement shown in this patent 
specification works well, and has been used extensively. However, the applicants have investigated 
alternative configurations, which provide the same ease of 
adjustment, and which also provide other advantages in 
relation to the load distribution to the various members  
 
associated with the harness. Further harness arrangements are known from US-A-4 660 889 or US-A-4 429 916. According to the invention, in a seat strap 
assembly of the type described above, the first ends of the 
straps are secured to the seat at respective attachment 
positions adjacent the shoulders of an occupant, and said 
apertures in said seat are adjacent to and either side of 
the waist of said occupant, whereby the portions of the two 
straps extending between said first ends and

<CLAIMS>
A seat strap assembly (10) comprising a pair of straps 
(12, 13), that are each secured at their first ends to said 

seat (14), said straps (12, 13) having second ends extending 
to and through apertures (24, 26) in said seat (14),
 
   mutually interconnectable coupling means (15) on each 

one of said straps (12, 13) positioned so that they overlie 
said occupant when they connect together,
 
   an adjustment strap (28) secured to the second end of 

each said strap (12, 13), and
 
   locking means (29) on said seat (14) for releasably 

securing said adjustment strap (28) so that said shoulder and 
lap straps (13, 12) may be loosened or tightened by changing 

the position of the adjustment strap (28) with respect to 
said locking means (29),
 
   characterised in that the first ends of the straps (12, 

13) are secured to the seat at respective attachment 
positions (20, 20a) adjacent the shoulders of an occupant, 

and said apertures (24, 26) in said seat (14) are adjacent to 
and either side of the waist of said occupant, whereby the 

portions of the two straps (12, 13) extending between said 
first ends and said coupling means (15) comprise shoulder 

straps (13), and the portions of the two straps extending 
between said coupling and said apertures (24, 26) comprise 

lap straps (12). 
A seat strap assembly according to claim 1 further 
comprising a crutch strap (11) secured at one end to said 

seat (14), the other end securable to said coupling means 
(15). 
A seat strap assembly according to claim 2 wherein said 
coupling means (15) comprises a three way buckle where the 

female member (16) of said buckle is secured to the end of 
said crutch strap (11), and the two male members (17) 

attached to one each of said straps (12, 13).  
 
A seat strap assembly according to claim 3 wherein each 
of the male members (17) of said buckle have belt receiving 

apertures for engagement on each of said straps (12, 13). 
A seat strap assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein said second ends of said straps (12, 

13) are connected. 
A seat strap assembly according to claim 5 wherein said

strap that is secured at each end to said first positions 
with the centre portion of said single strap extending 

between said apertures (24, 26) behind said seat. 
A seat strap assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein said adjustment strap (28) comprises 

a single strap extending substantially along the vertical 
centre line of said seat (14). 
A seat strap assembly according to claim 7 wherein the 
angle formed between said second ends of said strap (12, 13) 

either side of the connection point of said adjustment strap 
(28) increases as the size of the occupant increases, thereby 

resulting in less load being applied to said adjustment strap 
(28) when load is applied to said shoulder and lap straps 

(13, 12) by forward movement of the occupant. 
A seat strap assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein said locking means (29) comprises a 

lock that allows said adjustment strap (28) to be 
pulled freely through it to tighten said shoulder and lap 

straps (13, 12), and automatically locks against said 
adjustment strap (28) to prevent movement in the opposite
