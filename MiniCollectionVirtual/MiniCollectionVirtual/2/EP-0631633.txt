<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed and claimed are methods for selecting a recombinant virus, phage or cell expressing a catalytic antibody or catalytic portion thereof, or for selecting catalytic activity by a moiety. The method employs reaction-based selection for catalytic activity. The method can also be used to concentrate (increase the proportion of catalytic to non-catalytic moieties) a sample containing a catalytic moiety or viruses, phages or cells expressing a catalytic moiety. The selection or concentration can be by employing a mechanism-based inhibitor, catalysis-accelerated movement, surface binding, changes in enthalpic component of binding as a function of temperature, or changes in binding by competition, or combinations thereof. The invention also comprehends a method for producing a recombinant virus or a cell-line expressing a catalytic moiety such as a catalytic antibody or catalytic portion thereof; and, this method can include infecting a suitable host with viruses which are screened for the expression. In addition, recombinant viruses and cell-lines so expressing a catalytic moiety such as a catalytic antibody or catalytic portion thereof are also disclosed and claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention broadly relates to methods for
selection for catalytic moieties to methods for
increasing the concentration of catalytic moieties in a
sample containing catalytic moieties, and to
substantially pure or concentrated catalytic products
from such methods. This invention also relates to
methods for selection or concentrating a population of
recombinant viruses suspected of including viruses
expressing catalytic antibodies or catalytic portions
thereof. This invention also relates to detecting
recombinant viruses that express a catalytic antibody or
catalytic portions thereof and act catalytically. This
invention further relates to a method for producing a
recombinant virus or a cell-line expressing a catalytic
antibody or catalytic portions thereof by infecting a
host susceptible to infection by a recombinant virus that
expresses a catalytic antibody or catalytic portion
thereof. This invention also relates to substantially
pure recombinant virus or cell populations which express
a catalytic antibody or catalytic portion thereof from
the aforesaid methods.Throughout this disclosure reference will be
made to the published literature by numerals in
parenthesis. These numerical references correspond to a
listing of such literature references appearing at the
end of this disclosure; all of these literature
references being hereby incorporated herein by reference.Viruses infect cells and divert the
biosynthetic apparatus of the cell to synthesizing virus
progeny. Certain viruses infect the host cell, cause the
host DNA to break down and virus progeny to form in the
cell whereupon the cell lyses with the release of mature 
virus progeny. Other viruses are lysogenic. These
viruses infect a host cell and the viral DNA becomes
inserted into a region of the host chromosome whereupon
for generations the resultant cell-line (from replication
of the infected cell) expresses genetic products of the
virus. A progeny of the original infected cell can
spontaneously release the viral DNA from its chromosome
or be induced to do the same, whereupon a lytic cycle
resulting in viral progeny occurs. An example of this
latter type of virus is the phage lambda which on certain
occasions, e.g., exposure to certain chemicals or
radiation such as ultraviolet light, may initiate a lytic
cycle immediately after infection but can otherwise exist
as a provirus or prophage in the E.coli host genome for
many generations.A recent development in the field of antibodies
is the amplification by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)

organism population capable of expression of a surface-bound

catalytic moiety comprising:

reaction-based selection for catalytic activity by a
