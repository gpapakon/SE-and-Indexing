<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coupling device for a conveyor apparatus which is used particularly for in-house suspended conveyance in the clothing industry, the conveyor apparatus having a carrier rail which is suspended on a running rail or the like and on which carrier tubes (7) as holding devices are mounted displaceably via carrier yokes (15). According to the invention, adjacent carrier tubes (7) can be selectively coupled to one another by means of hook-on coupling members (1, 2). There is provided for this purpose a blocking device (20, 21) for the selective blocking and release of the coupling connection of adjacent carrier tubes (7), the said blocking device (20, 21) comprising a blocking chock (22) which is assigned to the respective coupling member (1, 2), is connected to the carrier-tube end and is pivotable between a blocking position and a release position, in which it does not prevent the coupling engagement.

Coupling device for a conveyor system particularly of the 
type used for the in-house hanging transport of clothing in 

the garment industry, in which the conveyor comprises a 
support rail suspended on a guide track or similar, on 

which hangers (15) fitted with rollers (16) are provided, 
such that the rollers (16) rest on a support rail with the 

hangers (15) suspended underneath it and the hangers (15) 
carry supporting tubes (7) or similar holding elements and 

between adjacent supporting tube ends there are mutually 
engaging coupling elements (1, 2), such that the said 

coupling elements (1, 2) consist of a strip-shaped thin 
material and comprise a support web (4) extending forwards 

parallel to the longitudinal axis (5) of the supporting 
tube (7) with an arched web (6) at its end, positioned so 

that the curve of the arched web (6) is directed inwards 
towards the longitudinal axis (5) with its zenith point 

(10) located between the said longitudinal axis (5) and the 
support web (4),
characterized in that
 
a blocking device (20, 21, 40, 41, 50, 51) is provided for 

the selective blocking and release of the coupling 
connection between adjacent supporting tubes (7), the said 

blocking device comprising a blocking-piece (22, 42, 53) 
fitted to the end of the supporting tube and associated 

with the respective coupling element (1, 2) such that it 
can pivot between a blocking position, in which the arched 

web (6) of an adjacent supporting tube (7) makes contact 
with a blocking surface (34) of the blocking-piece (22, 42, 

53) before coupling engagement can occur with the arched 
web (6) of the coupling element (1, 2) with which it is 

associated, and a release position in which it does not 
impede the coupl
ing engagement, and the pivot bearing of 
the said blocking-piece (22, 42, 53) is designed such that 

the blocking-piece snaps into its blocking and release 
positions.  

 
Coupling device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the contour of the blocking surface (34) conforms to the 

external contour of the arched web (6). 
Coupling device according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the blocking-piece (22, 42, 53) is fitted to a holding arm 

(12) that projects sideways from the end of the supporting 
tube. 
Coupling device according to Claim 3,
characterized in that
 
the holding arm (12) is a sliding web arranged at the end 

of the arched web (6) opposite the arched web (4) and 
facing obliquely outwards, such that between the curve of 

the arched web and the sliding web (12) there is a gap 
through which the coupling arched web (6) of the adjacent 

coupling element (1, 2) can pass. 
Coupling device according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
a lateral groove (23) is located in the blocking-piece (22) 

so that a lever arm (27) is formed, and at the free end of 
the said lever arm (27) a transverse groove of essentially 

U-shaped cross-section open towards the opposite side-wall 
of the groove (23) is provided, and at the free end of the 

holding arm (12) there is a pivot attachment of square 
design which engages in and is clamped between the 

transverse groove (28) and the side-wall of the groove (23) 
opposite the bottom of the groove (28). 
Coupling device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
the blocking-piece (42) is fitted pivotally to the holding 

arm (12), preferably via a springy holding arm web (44) 
which engages with a curved end section extending at an  

 
angle to the pivot plane of the holding arm web (44) into 

a groove in the blocking-piece (42) that extends 
transversely to the holding arm web (44) at the end thereof 

near the blocking-piece, the said holding arm web having an 
outer edge curved in the shape of a circle whose centre of 

curvature is offset relative to the pivoting centre of the 
holding arm web (44), such that in the blocking position of 

the blocking device the curved end section can be guided 
into the groove with minimal stress when it is facing 

towards the zenith of the circular curved edge, while the 
blocking device is in its release position when the holding 

arm web is located laterally against the curved edge. 
Coupling device according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
the blocking-piece (53) has a rectangular shape and is 

fitted onto a square-section rotation shaft (56) of the 
holding arm (12) by means of a spring clip (54) with a U-shaped 

central portion (54a), the said shaft, being 
positioned inside a recess (55) of the holding arm (12) to 

enable the blocking-piece (53) to pivot between positions 
on the two sides of the holding arm, in which the central 

portion (54a) of the spring clip engages around the square 
rotation shaft (56) with a form-closing fit.
