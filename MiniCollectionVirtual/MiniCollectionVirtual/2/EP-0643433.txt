<ABSTRACT>
A simple method is disclosed for preparing LiPF₆ 
based electrolytes for use in lithium non-aqueous 

batteries. LiPF₆ is synthesized in a mixture of solvents 
employed in the electrolyte itself. Using the invention 

method, residual reactants and by-products of the reaction 
are easily removed to a required level for practical 

battery applications while the LiPF₆ remains in solution. 
The method is suitable for preparing electrolytes for 

lithium ion batteries wherein solvents such as 
diethylcarbonate, ethylene carbonate, and propylene 

carbonate are employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of 
batteries, and in particular to a novel method of preparing 
a LiPF6 electrolyte solution for non-aqueous lithium 
batteries. The demand for higher energy density power 
sources for electronics devices is continually increasing 
as these devices shrink in size. This demand is being 
increasingly met using recently developed lithium primary 
and rechargeable battery systems. The commercial success 
of such systems, in part, relies on the availability of 
suitable non-aqueous electrolytes. High voltage (> 3 V) 
and high rate (of order of 1C rate) lithium battery systems 
require an electrolyte that is stable over a wide range in 
potential and has relatively high ionic conductivity. Only 
a handful of lithium salts currently exist that are 
suitable candidates for use in such electrolytes. The salt 
LiPF6 is one of these, and has received wide attention since 
it is also low in toxicity and stable in solution. 
Recently, Sony Energy Tec Inc. has produced the first 
commercially available lithium ion type battery in which 
the electrolyte contains LiPF6 salt dissolved in a mixture 
of diethylcarbonate (DEC) and propylene carbonate (PC) 
solvents. LiPF6 based electrolytes are generally prepared by 
dissolving solid LiPF6, or a complex thereof, in the desired 
electrolyte solvents. The heat of solution can be significant, and  
 
generally some means of temperature control must be used to 
prevent overheating and subsequent decomposition of the 
salt. LiPF6 itself can be prepared using one of several 
methods described in the literature. Many of these methods 
however result in a product with levels of impurities that 
are unsuitable for use in battery applications. For 
example, LiPF6 can be made by reacting BF3 with LiF and an 
excess of P2O5, but the product always contains LiF. Adequately pure LiPF6 has recently been produced 
by reacting PF5 with LiF in liquid HF. Such a method is 
used to manufacture LiPF6 for commercial purposes. However, 
this method involves using the hazardous compounds HF and 
PF5, and requires complex manufacturing equipment. Also, 
the product contains residual HF at a level of order of 200 
to 300 ppm. The product is nonetheless suitable for use in 
lithium ion batteries but is relatively expensive. U.S. Patent No. 3,654,330 discloses an alternate 
method of preparing pure LiPF6 from a Li(CH3CN)4PF6 
precursor. CH3CN is required rather than HF using this 
method. LiPF6, however, even in its pure form is reported 
to be somewhat unstable,
