<ABSTRACT>
A method of polishing a work W 
with a buff wheel (12) while supplying an 

abrasive material B between a polishing 
surface (121) of the buff wheel (12) adapted 

to be rotated by rotating means (1) and the 
work W, characterized in that an object surface 

of the work W is polished as the polishing 
surface (121) of the buff wheel (12) 

is moved toward and away from the object 
surface of the work W.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polishing-device for a
work with a surface to be polished, comprising buff wheels rotatable
by suitable means, for polishing the work and means for
rotating the work about an axis in the center of the surface
to be polished by the buff wheels. Further, the invention
relates to a polishing method.JP-A-59-182057 discloses a polishing device for a work with a surface
to be polished, comprising means for rotating the work about an
axis in the center of the surface to be polished, and a buff
wheel brought with its bottom surface into contact with the
surface of the work to be polished. Further, the document
discloses a polishing method making use of the device. With conventional polishing devices using a buff wheel, surface of
a work is polished by the buff wheel rotated by rotary drive means
while polishing agent is supplied.The conventional polishing device as described above, however, has
a disadvantage; since the polishing surface of the buff wheel is not
always in contact with the surface of the work to be polished,
polishing agent cannot sufficiently enter the gap between the polishing
surface of the buff wheel and the surface of the work to be
polished, the work cannot be polished efficiently.Moreover, since conventional polishing devices comprise a single buff wheel, a
suitable wheel has to be chosen according to the purpose of polishing,
resulting in difficulty in improving the working efficiency.Another disadvantage with the conventional polishing device is that
since only one buff wheel is provided with the polishing device, the
rotary directions of the buff wheel has to be changed because the work
has to be polished in both normal and reverse rotary directions. Furthermore, since the polishing surface of the buff wheel of the
conventional polishing device is not constantly in contact with the
surface of the work to be polished, polishing agent cannot sufficiently
enter the gap between the polishing surface of the buff wheel and
the surface of the work to be polished, and polishing cannot be made
uniform. As a result, polishing the surface of the work to be
polished cannot be made efficiently.Another disadvantage with the conventional polishing device is that
since the polishing agent is merely supplied, function of the
polishing agent is not effectively utilized.The object of the invention is to provide a device
for efficiently polishing the surface of the work to be polished and
capable of polishing the surface of the work to be polished in both
normal find reverse

<CLAIMS>
A polishing device for a work (W) with a surface
to be polished, comprising

means for
rotating the work (W) about an axis in the center of the surface to be

polished, a pair of
buff wheels (12,22),

one (12) of the buff wheels being rotatable in the direction of
the rotating direction of the work (W) and brought with its

bottom surface into contact with the surface of the work
(W) to be polished while the other one (22) of the buff

wheels is rotatable in the direction opposite to the rotating
direction of the work (W) and capable to be brought with its bottom surface

into contact with the surface of the work (W) to be
polished.
A polishing device for a work (W) with a surface
to be polished, comprising

means for
rotating the work (W) about an axis in the center of the surface to be

polished and a pair of
buff wheels (12,22),

one (12) of the buff wheels being rotatable in the direction of
the rotating direction of the work (W) and capable to be brought with its

outer circumferential surface into contact with the surface
of the work (W) to be polished while the other one (22) of

the buff wheels is rotatable in the direction opposite to the
rotating direction of the work (W) and capable to be brought with its outer

circumferential surface into contact with the surface
of the work (W) to be polished. 
A polishing method in which a work (W) with a surface to
be polished is being rotated about an axis in the center of

the surface to be polished, whereby the surface to be polished of
the work is polished by

buff wheels (12,22) provided in a pair,
wherein both wheels of the pair are brought either with

their bottoms or with their outer circumferential surface
into contact with the surface of the work (W) to be polished,

one (12) of the buff wheels is rotated in the direction
of the rotating direction of the work (W) and

brought into contact with the surface of the work (W) to be
polished while the other one (22) of the buff wheels is rotated

in the direction opposite to the rotation direction
of the work (W) and brought into contact with the surface

of the work (W) to be polished.
