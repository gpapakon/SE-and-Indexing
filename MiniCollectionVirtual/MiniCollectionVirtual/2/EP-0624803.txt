an electrical protection device, particularly of a 

differential cutout, and of the connection of the ground 
line in interior wiring, characterized in that it includes 

a resistor (15,16) insertable between the phase line and 
the ground line and sized so as to produce such a ground 

current as to cause the intervention of the differential 
cutout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit device for 
checking the correct operation of an electrical protection 
device, particularly of a differential cutout, and of the 
connection of the ground line in interior wiring. It is known that wiring rules prescribe, as a 
protection device, an efficient grounding system and a 
differential cutout. The efficiency of these protection devices can 
currently be tested only by specialized personnel with the 
aid of appropriate instruments and thus with very high 
costs. Furthermore, due to their troublesome nature, these 
tests are not performed with the necessary frequency, and 
consequently the actual efficiency of the wiring may remain 
unknown even for very long periods, with the consequent 
risks. A technical aim of the present invention is to provide 
a device that allows to obviate the shortcomings of the 
checks currently performed on interior wiring, especially 
for homes and offices. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a device which has a low cost so 
that it is affordable for a vast number of potential 
purchasers. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a device that can be used with maximum safety even by non-experts.  With this aim and this object in view, as well as 
with others which will become apparent hereinafter, there 
is provided a device as defined in the appended claims. Further characteristics and advantages of the device 
according to the present invention will become apparent 
from the following detailed description of a preferred 
embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative 
example in the accompanying drawing, wherein: 
figure 1 is a circuit diagram of an interior wiring 
for civil use; figure 2 is a perspective view of the device according 
to the invention, suitable to check the efficiency of the 
protection devices of the wiring of figure 1; and figure 3 is an exploded view of the device of figure 
2. With reference to the above figures, the interior 
wiring comprises a differential cutout 1 of a commonly 
commercially available type. The two phase and neutral 
wires are connected to the input of the switch 1 and 
continue downstream of the cutout to supply energy to the 
users of the wiring. In figure 1, the phase and neutral wires are 
designated by the reference numerals 2 and 3 respectively 
and are connected to the terminals 4 and 5 of an outlet 6 
provided with a central terminal 7. A wire 8 extends from 
the terminal 7 and is connected to a
