<ABSTRACT>
An electronic apparatus has a first and a second engaging 
portion. After the first engaging portion (3) has mated with a hook 

portion included in a battery pack (5), the battery pack is pressed 
against the casing of the apparatus. As a result, a lock lever 

extending from the battery pack (6) bends in a first direction and 
mates with the second locking portion (4). A wall portion (7) is 

formed in the battery pack outboard of the lock lever and 
provided with adequate strength and elasticity. The wall 

portion protects the lock lever from damage when an excessive 
force, tending to bend the lock lever in a second direction 

opposite to the first direction, acts on the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for removably 
holding a battery pack on an electronic apparatus and, more 
particularly, to a structure for holding a battery pack 
accommodating batteries which power a portable telephone or 
similar miniature electronic apparatus. It has been customary with an electronic apparatus of the 
kind described to provide the casing of the apparatus with a 
first and a second engaging portion while providing a battery 
pack with a hook portion and a lock lever. The hook portion is 
engageable with the first engaging portion. The lock lever is 
made of a plastic or similar elastic material and engageable 
with the second engaging portion. To mount the battery pack to 
the casing, the former is pressed against the latter. As a 
result, the lock lever elastically bends and mates with the 
second engaging portion of the casing, locking the battery pack 
to the casing. To remove the battery pack from the casing, the 
lock lever is bent by finger until it has been released from the 
second engaging portion.  
 The conventional structure relies on the elasticity of the 
lock lever in locking and unlocking the battery pack from the 
casing of the apparatus, as stated above. The problem with 
such a structure is that the lock lever breaks when bent beyond 
the limit of elasticity thereof, as determined by experiments. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a battery pack holding structure for an electronic 
apparatus which protects a lock lever from damage even when 
an excessive force, tending to bend the lever outward, acts on 
the lever. This object is solved with the features of the claims.  
 In the above structure, the wall portion prevents the lock 
lever from bending excessively against the excessive force 
tending to bend the lever outward. The above and other objects, features and advantages of 
the present invention will become more apparent from the 
following detailed description taken with the accompanying 
drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 is a section showing a conventional battery pack 
holding structure for an electronic apparatus; Fig. 2 is a section showing a battery pack holding 
structure embodying the present invention; Fig. 3 is a perspective view of an electronic apparatus 
incorporating the structure of the present invention; and Fig. 4 is a section showing how an external force acts on a 
lock lever included in the embodiment. To better understand the present invention, a brief 
reference will be made to a conventional

<CLAIMS>
A structure for 
preventing from excessively bending a swayable 

lock lever (6) of a battery pack (2a), which 
is mountable to a battery 

casing (1) of an 
electronic apparatus and which accommodates 

batteries for feeding power to said electronic apparatus, said 
structure comprising: 


a first (3) and a second (4) flat engaging portion extending from 
said casing (1) in opposite directions for locking said battery pack (2a) 

in a longitudinal direction; 
a hook portion (5) provided on one end of said battery pack (2a) in 
the longitudinal direction for mating with said first engaging 

portion (3); 
wherein the lock lever (6) extends from the other end of said 
battery pack (2a) with respect to the longitudinal direction for 

mating with said second engaging portion (4) due to elasticity 
when said battery pack (2a) is pressed against said casing (1) after said 

first engaging portion (3) and said hook portion (5) have mated with 
each other, thereby locking said battery pack (2a) to said casing (1); and 

wherein a wall member (7) extends from said battery pack (2a) outboard 
of said lock lever (6) for limiting the bending motion of said lock lever 

in the direction opposite to the press direction. 
A structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein said wall 
member (7) has strength and elasticity which prevent said lock 

lever (6) from bending outward against the excessive force, while  
 

insuring engagement of said lock lever with said second 
engaging portion. 
A structure as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the casing (1) comprises 


an accommodating portion for 
accommodating said battery pack (2a) and 
the first (3) and the second (4) engaging portions are formed in said 
accommodating portion. 
A structure as claimed in claim 1, 2, or 3, wherein
 
   the swayable lock lever 

terminates at a lug engageable with said second engaging 
portion (4). 
A structure as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein said lock 
lever comprises an elastic member made of plastics.
