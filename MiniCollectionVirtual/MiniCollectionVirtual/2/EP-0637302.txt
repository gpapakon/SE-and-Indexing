 TITLE ARTHROPODICIDAL OXA- AND THIA-ZOLINES This invention pertains to spirocyclic oxa- and thia-zolines as arthropodicides. EP 345,775 and EP 432,661 disclose non-spirocyclic oxa- and thia-zolines as insecticides.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to compounds of Formula I, including all geometric and stereoisomers, agriculturally suitable salts thereof, agricultural compositions containing them and their use as arthropodicides in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments. The compounds arewhereinA is selected from the group a direct bond, O, S, -XCH2- and C1-C3 straight or branched chain alkylene; when A is -XCH2-, the point of attachment to the phenyl ring is X or CH2;G is selected from the group O, S, -CH^Y-CH^-, -Y(CH2)m- and CrC3 straight or branched chain alkylene; when G is -Y(CH2)m-, the point of attachment to the phenyl ring is Y or the terminal carbon, and the ring containing A and G has 5-7 members; X and Y are independently selected from the group O and S;Z is selected from the group O and S; R1 is selected from the group H, halogen, Cj-Cg alkyl, Cj-Cg alkoxy,Cj-Cό haloalkyl and Cj-Cg haloalkoxy; R2 is selected from the group H, halogen, Cj-Cj 5 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, C4-G7 cycloalkylalkyl, C C16 haloalkyl, C2-C16 alkenyl, C2-Cj 6 haloalkenyl, C2-C g alkynyl, C2-C16 haloalkynyl, C2-C16 alkoxyalkoxy, OR5, R5OC(O)~, R5C(O)- and 
is selected from the group direct bond, S, O, C(=O), C(=O)O,C(=O)O-C1-C2 alkylene, CrC4 alkylene, O-CrC4 alkylene and O-C2-C4 alkenylene, wherein when is O-C1-C4 alkylene or O-C2-C4 alkenylene, the oxygen atom can be attached to either aromatic ring and when W is C(=O)O or C(=O)O-C1-C2, the C(=O) moiety can be attached to either aromatic ring; Q is selected from CH and N;R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group H, halogen, Ci -Cg alkyl, CrC6 haloalkyl, CrC6 haloalkoxy, CrC6 alkylthio, CN and NO2;R5 is selected from the group H, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, C4-C16 cycloalkylaUsyl, CJ-CJ^ alkyl, Cj-Cjg haloalkyl, C2-C16 alkenyl, C2-C16 haloalkenyl, C2- 16 alkynyl and C2-C16 haloalkynyl; R6 is selected from the group halogen, CJ-CIQ alkyl, CJ-CH) alkoxy, Cj-CiQ haloalkyl, CrC10 haloalkoxy and Si(R7)(R8)R9;R7, R8 and R9 are independently C_ -C3 alkyl; m is 1 or 2; and n is 0 or an integer from 1 to 5.Preferred Compounds A are compounds of Formula I wherein: A is a direct bond;G is selected from the. group C2-C3 alkylene, -CH2-Y-CH2-, and-Y(CH2)m-; R1 is selected from the group H and halogen; and R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group H, F
