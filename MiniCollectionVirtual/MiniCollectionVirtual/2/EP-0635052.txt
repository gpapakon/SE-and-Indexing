<DESCRIPTION>
 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TO CELL SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE BACTERIUM STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAEDESCRIPTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention involves a monoclonal (MAb) with the specificity for a 67,000 dalton cell surface protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae , a cell line that produces said antibody, and the partially purified 67,000 dalton cell surface protein.BACKGROUND ARTS.pneumoniae is the leading cause of community- acquired bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcal disease), with approximately 500,000 cases a year reported in the United States. Bacterial pneumonia is the most prevalent among the very young, the elderly and immuno-compromised persons. In infants and children, pneumococci are the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia, otitis media and bactere ia and a less common cause of meningitis (causing 20-25% of reported cases).Pneumococci are carried in the respiratory tract of a significant number of healthy individuals. In spite of the high carriage rate, its presence does not necessarily imply infection. However, if one of the highly pathogenic pneumococcal types, such as S. neumoniae, is isolated from rusty-coloured sputum (also containing a large number of polymorphonuclear leucocytes), body fluids, blood cultures, or specimens collected via transtracheal or lung puncture from the lower respiratory tract, its detection is usually significant. 

 Detection of this bacteria at an early stage is essential to facilitate treatment of the infection. Thus, it is important to possess the ability to identify whether S.pneumoniae is present in a patient and to be enabled to follow the effect of. antibiotic treatment on the bacteria. As available immunoassays for S. neumoniae antigen detection have show lack of specificity and/or sensitivity, there remains the need for an improved method of such detection.S.pneumoniae is a gram positive bacteria. Proteins located on the cell surface of many gram positive bacteria have, in the past, been used in typing and immunoprotection studies. There are a large number of S.pneumoniae strains, and there are any cell surface proteins associated with S.pneumoniae. This has made the identification of a common but exclusive cell surface antigen difficult. However, MAb technology has provided researchers with tools to reproducible and accurately analyze the cell surface components of S.pneumoniae. In addition, S.pneumoniae proteins are of interest to epidemiologists as they may provide for vaccines against the bacteria.One such pneumonococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine has
