<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved synthetic methods for 
making mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic 
acid; it has the following formula. 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and 
the immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-viral uses 
thereof are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,753,935 ("the '935 Patent"). An acid halide condensation route for synthesizing mycophenolate 
mofetil has been described in the '935 Patent. This synthetic method 
suffered from various deficiencies. The acid halide condensation route 
required a two-step process and necessitated the use of three (3) molar 
equivalents of 2-morpholinoethanol to give a yield of 85% mycophenolate 
mofetil, which included the formation of a dimeric impurity (2%), among 
others, requiring a recrystallization step. Color problems with the 
finished product were also associated with this synthetic method due to 
trace iron contamination considered secondary to corrosive conditions 
caused by thionyl chloride in the acid chloride step. A carbodiimide route described in the '935 Patent has proven 
impractical for the synthesis of pharmaceutical grade mycophenolate mofetil 
due to an unacceptable percentage of impurities in the final product. Those skilled in the field of esterification reactions will 
appreciate that the conventional teachings for synthesis of an ester 
through the reaction of an acid and an alcohol has required the use of a 
catalyst to achieve acceptable yields. See, for example, Morrison & Boyd 
"Organic Chemistry", Allyn and Bacon, Fifth Edition, pp. 841-843, 872-874. 
Catalytic reactions, however, entail the added cost of the catalyst and the 
additional steps of its addition and separation from the reaction mixture. Thus, a non-catalytic alternative for synthesizing mycophenolate 
mofetil has been desired. It has surprisingly been discovered that good 
yields of mycophenolate mofetil can be obtained without the disadvantage of 
the prior described methods and without the use of a catalyst. Moreover,  
 
it has unexpectedly been discovered that the reaction of mycophenolic acid 
and 2-morpholinoethanol gives at least the equivalent or increased yields 
by omitting the use of a catalyst (i.e., use of a traditional catalyst does 
not increase or even slows the reaction). These, and other aspects of the 
present invention are described in greater detail below in the Summary and 
Detailed Description of the Invention. One
