<ABSTRACT>
A straightening, supporting and spinal osteosynthesis device using variable implants with single-piece hooks for bilateral costotransverse engagement. The variable implants mainly consist of upwardly or downwardly directed hooks (21, 22 and 31, 32) joined together by a yoke (23, 33) shaped to fit the vertebrae. Said implants (20, 30) are attached to connecting bars (51, 52) at their yokes (23, 33) by means of a hook (60) having a slot (61) and being locked onto the bars (51, 52) when they are tilted in the longitudinal direction by means of a screw (7).

<CLAIMS>
A spinal osteosynthesis device for supporting straightening and 
fixing the spine, comprising implants anchored on the vertabrae, at least 

one connecting bar (51, 52) for supporting said implants and removable 
elements for locking the implants onto the bars 
characterized in that
 the 
implants applied to dorsal vertebrae have two hooks (21, 22 and 31, 32) 

and a yoke (23, 33) between the hooks, the implants applied to lumbar 
vertebrae have two eyes and a yoke (23, 33) between them, the elements 

(20, 30) for locking the implants onto the bars (51, 52) are tilting hooks (60) 
each having a slot (61) and a groove (630) with a semi-cylindrical bottom, 

the radius of the semi-cylindrical part being-the same as that of the bars 
(51, 52) and a threaded bore (632) in the body 63 of the hook (60) wherein 

an adjusting screw (7) is arranged for tilting the hook (60) until the yoke (23, 
33) connecting the hooks or eyes is locked and the claw
s (62) of the hooks 
(60) are conform with the cross-section of the yokes (23, 33). 
The device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
implants (20, 30) are provided with hooks (21, 22 and 31, 32) bended in the 

same sense, hooks (21, 22) bended in opposite directions, the left hook (21 
being directed upwardly and hooks 31, 32 bended in opposite directions, 

the right hook (32) being directed upwardly. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the yokes 
(23, 33) connecting the hooks (21, 22 and 31, 32) are embracing the 

curvature of the vertebrae and preventing rotation with respect to the 
bars by opposite flatterings (231, 232 and 331, 332) and by the slotted 

hook 60. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
threaded bore (632) with the adjusting screw (7) tilting the slotted hook (60) 

is arranged backwardly along an angle of about 25Â° and at a certain 
distance (D) from the vertical plane of the claws (62) of the hook (60). 
The device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the base 
of the slotted hooks (60) is prolonged on the side of the threaded bore (632)  

 
receiving the adjusting and fixing screw (7) for providing a level to increase 

the locking effect between the yoke (23, 33) connecting the hooks or eyes 
of the implants and the bars (51, 52).
