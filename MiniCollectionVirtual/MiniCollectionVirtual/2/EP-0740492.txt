<ABSTRACT>
The ignition and operating system allows the electric discharge lamp to be supplied with a current having an effective value which is above the effective value of the network current during a heating-up phase, following the lamp ignition, for bringing the lamp into a nominal operating phase. The current supplied to the lamp in the heating-up phase has a ratio of greater than 1 between the effective value and the rectified value, with the latter pref. being as low as possible.

Method for starting and operating a high-pressure
discharge lamp (EL), the high-pressure discharge lamp,

in a start-up operating state following ignition of the
high-pressure discharge lamp, being fed a current

having an rms value (I
rms1
) which is higher than the rms
value of a rated current, which is fed to the high-pressure

discharge lamp in a rated operating state,

characterized in that
 an inductance (L) is connected in
series with the high-pressure discharge lamp (EL), and

the current fed to the high-pressure discharge lamp in
the start-up operating state has a frequency which is

higher than the frequency of the current in the rated
operating state, with the result that, owing to the

inductance (L) and the higher frequency in the start-up
operating state, the current fed to the high-pressure

discharge lamp in the start-up operating state has a
form factor (ratio I
rms1
/I
gl
) which is greater than "1"
and greater than a form factor of the current fed to

the high-pressure discharge lamp in the rated operating
state.
Circuit arrangement for starting and operating a
high-pressure discharge lamp (EL) in accordance with

the method according to Claim 1, having a device (SNT,
S1 - S4) for feeding a current to the lamp in a start-up

operating state following ignition, which current
has a higher rms value than a rated current in the 

rated operating state, 
characterized in that
 an
inductance (L) is connected in series with the lamp

(EL), and the device (SNT, S1 - S4) feeds a current to
the lamp in the start-up operating state which has a

higher frequency than in the rated operating state,
with the result that, owing to the inductance and the

higher frequency, the current fed to the high-pressure
discharge lamp in the start-up operating state has a

form factor which is greater than "1" and is greater
than a form factor of the current in the rated

operating state.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 it has a bridge arrangement (S1,
S2, S3, S4), 
in that
 the high-pressure discharge lamp
(EL) and the inductance (L), connected in series with

said high-pressure discharge lamp (EL), are arranged in
the bridge circuit of the bridge arrangement, 
in that

the bridge arrangement is connected on the input side
to a switched-mode power supply (SNT) and is driven by

a control circuit (C), the control circuit (C) in the
start-up operating state driving switches in the bridge

arrangement in complementary fashion at the higher
frequency, and, in the rated operating state, driving

the switches in the bridge arrangement in complementary
fashion at the lower frequency.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3,

characterized in that
 the switched-mode power supply
(SNT) regulates the power fed into the high-pressure

discharge lamp (EL).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2, 3 or 4,

characterized in that
 the control circuit (C) instructs
the switched-mode power supply (SNT) to output a

relatively high electrical power to the high-pressure
discharge lamp in the start-up operating state and to 

output a relatively low electrical power, which
corresponds to the rated power, to the high-pressure

discharge lamp in the rated operating state.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2
to 5, 
characterized in that
 the inductance (L) is non-linear
and is dimensioned such that it is operated in

the start-up operating state in the region of
saturation.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 6,

characterized in that
 the inductance (L) is dimensioned
such that saturation of the non-linear inductance

occurs essentially when the rms value is two to three
times that of the rated operating current.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2
to 7, 
characterized in that
 the inductance (L) can be
switched between a first value (L') and a second value

(L'').
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2
to 8, 
characterized in that
 the high-pressure discharge
lamp is ignited using an ignition apparatus (Z), which

is formed by at least one additional winding on the
inductance.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2
to 9, 
characterized in that
 a capacitance (CR) is
arranged in parallel with the high-pressure discharge

lamp.
