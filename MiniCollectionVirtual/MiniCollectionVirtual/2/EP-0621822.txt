Method for the manufacture of mouldable products implementing 
optimized equipment and technological organization solutions, aiming to 

improve the concentration, automation and flexibility of the manufacturing 
process as well as the curing of the moulded material, characterized: 


in that a widened and improved range of moulding means and of 
covers for closing these is incorporated into optimized rotary structures 

and thus forms modular rotary cylinders having at least two faces, capable 
of promoting the concentration, automation and flexibility of the 

manufacturing process by assigning, on the one hand, a rotary travel of 
more than 270° and preferably equal to 360° to the curing of the moulded 

material (concrete, mortar, plaster, clay, plastic, etc.), and, on the 
other hand, by grouping together the main workstations into at least five 

privileged general technological flow solutions: 

integral grouping-together above the cylinders; 
duplicated grouping-together above the cylinders and at one 
or both ends; 
duplicated grouping-together above and beside the cylinders; 
integral grouping-together either at one of the ends of the 
cylinders or at both; 
integral grouping-together beside the cylinders. 
in that the concentration, automation and flexibility of the 
manufacturing process are obtained also by implementation of an evolutive 

association of rotary cylinders and of installation of utilities which are 
specific to the method with the aid of optimized assembly structures, the 

said association giving rise to "cylinder-type workshops" for the lowest 
levels of association and to "cylinder-type factories" for the highest 

levels of association, which workshops and factories in some cases are 
produced in the form of units which can be moved by water, rail or road; 
in that the curing of the moulded material, such as concrete, 
is improved by the joint use of the following operational modes:  

 

assigning to the said curing a rotary travel of more than 
270°, and in some cases even more than 360°, when the cooling phase is 

performed on a secondary cylinder of utilities, associated with the main 
cylinder; 
grouping together at the same point the operations of mould 
release and concreting in order to decrease the thermal shocks on the 

concrete and draw benefit from the thermal inertia of the moulds; 
modulable transmission of the vibrations produced during the 
compacting of the concrete to all of the moulding means filled with 

concrete, by adjusting the elastic suspension of the said moulding means; 
intensive heat treatment (T T I) of the concrete with this 
concrete being completely enclosed in the moulding means over a travel 

often equal to a rotation of the cylinders through 360° and with, as a 
result, enhanced neutralization of the expansion of the gases occluded 

within the concrete and of the leakage by evaporation of the molecules of 
water which are indispensable for quality hydration; 
total multi-axis hydration of the cement molecules due 
jointly to the change in inclination of the concrete during the 360° of 

rotation of the cylinders and to the aforementioned residual vibrations.

cylinder and a rotary device (143) and two platforms (190) located 
laterally with respect to the rotary device, the rows being connected 

fourthly by two longitudinal beams (191) equipped with gusset plates 
(192) having, on the one hand, plates (184) which ensure the mounting 

of the two lateral parts of the thermal screen (140) and, on the other 
hand, arms (193) which facilitate the production of two lateral 

platforms (194) partly overhanging the cylinder, the rows being connected 
fifthly by two longitudinal beams (195) acting as a support for 

a roof structure (196) made up of one or more assemblies equipped, 
preferably before mounting, with a runway (197) common to the 

utilities installations;  
 
a secondary framework having two top portal frames (198) 
connected by at least two longitudinal beams (199), the portal frames 

being equipped, on the one hand, with two support beams (200) fitted 
with vertical adjustment means (201) so as to ensure the mounting of 

the rotary device (143) at the optimum height with respect to the 
associated cylinder and equipped, on the other hand, with two top 

walkways (202). 
Cylinder-type factory according to any one of Claims 3 to 
10, characterized in that its structure with which the various 

installations are assembled around the cylinder with which it is 
associated comprises: 


a ship's hull (203) reinforced by transverse (204) and 
longitudinal (205) ribs, the hull being equipped firstly with a multi-function 

bottom framework having transverse beams (206) and 
longitudinal beams (207) welded to transverse ribs (204), so that the 

said framework simultaneously provides support for the frames (208) 
for supporting and rotating the cylinder, support for the floor of a 

machine room (electric generator set, hydraulic unit, compressor, 
boiler, etc) situated at one of the ends of the cylinder, support for 

the floor of a maintenance and miscellaneous storage room situated at 
the other end of the cylinder, the raising up of the said frames and 

floors in order to place them out of reach of any water which may 
infiltrate, the bracing of the hull, the uniform distributing of the 

loads transmitted by the aforementioned equipment and adjustable 
ballasting, the hull being equipped secondly with two floors (209) 

located at the two ends of the cylinder at an optimum height so as 
simultaneously to ensure the bracing of the lateral walls of the hull, 

the ground for the workstations outside the cylinder (D2, E, NH2, PA, 
etc), the ground for the various auxiliaries (sanitary, laboratory, 

office, etc), and the ceilings of the aforementioned rooms (machine, 
maintenance, storage, etc), the hull being equipped thirdly with two 

demountable bridges (210) overhanging the cylinder served; and  
 
a demountable add-on arc-shaped framework (211), the bases of which 
bear on the lateral walls of the hull, and the top part of which 

incorporates a runway common to the ordinary installations for 
feeding/distributing the concrete and for cleaning/oiling the moulds, 

and common to a specific handling installation, which runway is made 
up of two beams (212) secured together and to the arc-shaped framework 

by gusset plates (213) so as to ensure, at the same time, the 
transverse stiffening and longitudinal bracing of the said framework 

equipped with roofing elements (214). 
Cylinder-type factory according to any one of Claims 3 to 
10, characterized in that its structure with which the various 

installations are assembled around the cylinder with which it is 
associated comprises: 


a technical floor with strong framework (216) and mounted 
on several rows of posts (215), the floor overhanging the cylinder and 

having an opening of dimensions greater than those of the array of 
moulds to be found at the top of the cylinder, and a runway (217) 

being mounted on the longitudinal edges of the said opening in the 
floor, the said floor acting as a ceiling for the room (218) available 

for fitting-out various ordinary installations of utilities; 
a runway (219) with extension outside the structure, 
allowing a specific handling installation to serve the workstations 

(B, DA and NH1) located axially with respect to the cylinder and also 
the workstations (E, D2, NH2, MP and MT) located on the technical 

floor (216) transversely with respect to the cylinder; and 
a thermal screen (140), the upper two parts of which are 
secured to the technical floor (216) and to the posts (215), and the 

lower part of which rests on concrete supports (220).
