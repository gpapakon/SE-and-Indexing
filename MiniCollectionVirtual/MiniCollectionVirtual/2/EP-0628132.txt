<ABSTRACT>
A variable timing gear device for an engine component driven by a drive system from the engine drive shaft. The gear device comprises an epicyclic or differential gear mechanism, an input of which is driven from the engine drive shaft and an output being connected to the driven shaft of the component. The device allows the drive speed between the input and output to be varied. The device may include means for varying the phase relationship between the engine drive shaft and the driven shaft of the component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine and gear 
drive combination. In engine designs up until now, it has been customary 
to operate with set (fixed) valve timing and fuel injection 
timing relative to a crankshaft datum. This, however, is 
not conducive to optimum engine performance for running 
over a range of different operating and load conditions on 
the engine. There have been proposals previously for phase 
adjustment in these timings during engine running but these 
have proved over complex and/or ineffective. For example, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical 
Engineers, vol. 86, nÂ° 23, 1972, London, Pages 301-306 
("Proceedings, IMechE") discloses a stackable gear device 
for adjusting the rotational phase between a cam and the 
crank shaft of an engine. A separate stackable gear device 
is required for each cam. The gear device includes a lever 
connected to a planet gear carrier. Movement of the lever 
causes phase adjustment. The lever is movable in a plane 
normal to the axis of rotation of the planet gear carrier. 
Movement of the lever is cyclical and is governed by a 
mechanical arrangement forming part of the device. WO-A-92/01144 describes a gear device which is similar 
to that of "Proceedings, IMechE" in that movement of a 
lever connected to the planet gear carrier of the device is 
also cyclical but is governed by the rotation of an 
eccentric cam in contact with the lever. With this 
arrangement, the range of phase adjustment is small. DE-A-3 204 841 also describes a gear device for an 
internal combustion engine having a planetary drive  
 
including phasing control through a lever on which the 
planet gears are mounted. The lever is movable in a plane 
normal to the planet gears axes. However, movement of the 
lever is once again cyclical and the magnitude of 
rotational phase adjustment between a cam and the engine 
crankshaft during cyclical movement of the lever is 
dependent on the degree to which the vehicle accelerator 
pedal is depressed. With each of the aforementioned devices, it is not 
possible to selectively adjust the plane adjustment in 
response to a monitored engine operating parameter. This 
is possible with US-A-4 305 352 which describes an internal 
combustion engine including means for adjusting the 
rotational phase of the engine cam shaft with respect to 
the crankshaft through the use of a planetary gear device. 
Phase adjustment is achieved by moving a lever which 
rotates a wormgear in meshing engagement with a toothed 
periphery of a planet
