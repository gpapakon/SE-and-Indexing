<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of combating 
caterpillar pests, using a compound of general formula 


where X represents a halogen atom, R represents a hydrogen 
atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group, and Q 

represents an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl 
group. 
Certain compounds of general formula I are novel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the combating of 
certain insect pests using isothiazole compounds, some of 
which are novel. Aspects of the invention relate to the 
use of such compounds in combating larval pests, to novel 
compounds, compositions and synthetic processes. U.S. Patent No. 3541108 discloses pesticidal 
isothiazole derivatives of the formula 
wherein R may be COR₁ where R₁ is an alkyl radical 
containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms or phenyl. Insecticidal and herbicidal activity of the compounds 
of U.S. Patent No. 3541108 is disclosed, the former being 
against Musca domestica (housefly) and Blatta orientalis 
(oriental cockroach). G.B. Patent No. 1226913 discloses a method for the 
preparation of pesticidal, especially herbicidal and 
insecticidal, compounds of general formula  in which R¹ is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical 
containing up to 6 carbon atoms or is a COR² radical, R² is 
Ar or a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl 
radical containing up to 18 carbon atoms, which can be 
substituted by at least one halogen atom, nitrile group or 
radical Ar and/or in which one or more -CH₂- groups can be 
replaced by oxygen and/or an -NH- group which may be 
substituted and/or CO, and/or in which one or more =CH-groups 
are replaced by nitrogen, or R² is a cycloalkyl 
radical containing 3-6 carbon atoms, or is a furyl, 
pyrrolyl or thienyl radical which can be substituted by at 
least one halogen atom, nitro or sulphonic acid group or 
acetyl radical, Ar is a phenyl or naphthyl radical which 
can be substituted by at least one halogen atom, cyano, 
nitro, hydroxyl, mercapto or amino group or alkyl, alkoxy, 
alkylthio, alkylamino or dialkylamino radicals, wherein 
the alkyl radicals or parts of radicals contain up to 4 
carbon atoms, and R³ is a chlorine or bromine atom. It has now been determined that certain isothiazole 
compounds, some of which are novel, show interesting and 
unexpected activity in combating larval pests of 
lepidoptera species. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a method of combating caterpillar pests  
 
at a locus, which comprises treating the locus with a 
compound of general formula 
where X represents a halogen atom, R represents a hydrogen 
atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group, and Q 
represents an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl 
group. Unless otherwise stated in this specification, an 
alkyl group may be linear or branched and suitably 
contains up to 10, preferably up to 6, and most preferably 
up to 4,
