<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new silacyclohexane compound,
a method of preparing it, and a liquid crystal composition
which contains it as well as a liquid crystal display
element which contains said liquid crystal composition.A liquid crystal display element utilizes the optical
anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystals. Display
methods include the TN mode (twisted nematic mode), the STN
mode (super twisted nematic mode), the SBE mode (super birefringence
mode), the DS mode (dynamic scattering mode), the guest-host
mode, the DAP mode ("deformation of aligned phase" mode) and
the OMI mode (optical mode interference mode). The most common
display device has a twisted nematic structure based on the
Schadt-Helfrich mode.Properties required of the liquid crystal substance 
used in these liquid crystal displays are somewhat
different depending on the display method. However, a wide
liquid crystal temperature range and stability against moisture,
air, light, heat, electric fields, etc. are commonly
required in all display modes. Furthermore, it is desirable
for the liquid crystal material to have a low viscosity, and
also to have a short address time, low threshold voltage
and high contrast in the cell(s).Currently, there is no single compound which
satisfies all these requirements. In practice, liquid
crystal mixtures are obtained by mixing several to more
than ten liquid crystal compounds and liquid crystal like compounds.
Because of this, it is also important that components of
a liquid crystal composition mix easily each other.Among liquid crystal compounds which can be
components for these, one of the basic components
conventionally known which control the electro-optical
performance is a compound which has a so-called cyclohexyl
ring-cyclohexyl ring-phenyl ring structure (CCP structure)
such as
In recent years, along with the expansion of the applications
of liquid crystal displays, the characteristics required of
liquid crystal materials are becoming more and more advanced
and demanding. In particular, superior characteristics such
as a lower driving voltage, a wider temperature range for automobile
onboard use and improved low temperature performance, compared 
with conventional liquid crystal substances, are desired.
EP-A-0 545 409 describes liquid crystals containing in the wing
groups several Si atoms which are bridged with each other by alkylene
groups.The object of this invention is to provide a liquid
crystal compound containing silacyclohexane rings, which is
completely different
