<ABSTRACT>
A mixture preparation device for double-feed engines comprising a 
body (11) in which two ducts are provided, namely a first duct 

(12) for air feed to the crankcase and a second duct (13) 
connected to an injection device, throttle elements (10, 35) being 

provided for the two ducts (12, 13), in the second duct (13) 
connected to the injection device there being provided an air-fuel 

mixture emission unit (29-34) adjustable in its degree of opening, 
the opening being controlled by transmission elements (49, 50) 

operationally connected to a shaft (36, 43) carrying one of the 
throttle elements (35) positioned within the first duct (12) for 

air feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mixture preparation device for a double-feed 
engine. Double-feed engines find particular application in the field of 
two-stroke engines with controlled ignition, such as that 
described in European patent application EP-A-514 982 of the 
present applicant. The essential advantage of this type of engine is that scavenging 
is effected with air whereas the fuel is injected, in the form of 
a rich mixture (equivalence ratio < 1), directly into the 
combustion chamber. This leads to a considerable reduction in 
fresh mixture losses at the exhaust. In such engines, in particular small engines in which an important 
consideration is production economy and low selling price, the 
fuel feed components should be as simple as possible. An initial 
indication regarding the general choice to be made is determined 
by the fact that the most simple manner of introducing the fuel is 
by means of a carburation device. In particular, such a device 
could in the limit be a pipe of narrow cross-section for air 
passage using the Venturi effect. DE-A-1 526 691 discloses a mixture preparation 
device according to the preamble of claim 1. In consideration of this known art, the object of the present  
 
invention is to provide a device for controlling the engine main 
air flow and for accurately regulating the quantity of fuel 
supplied together with the secondary air to an injection device. 
This object is attained according to the present invention by a 
mixture preparation device for a double-feed engine according to claim 1. The structural and operational characteristics and advantages of 
the device according to the present invention will be more 
apparent from the following description given by way of nonlimiting 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a section through the device of the invention taken on 
the line I-I of Figure 2; Figure 2 is a section through the device of the invention taken on 
the line II-II of Figure 1; Figure 3 is an enlarged sectional view of a part of the device 
shown in Figure 1. The drawings show a mixture preparation device for double-feed 
engines, for example a two-stroke engine with controlled ignition. The device comprises a body 11 in which there are provided two 
ducts 12 and 13, one for feeding air to a crankcase and the other 
connected to an injection device, not shown. In each of the two ducts 12 
and 13 there are provided relative valving and throttle means, such 
as butterfly valves 10 and 35. Below the body
