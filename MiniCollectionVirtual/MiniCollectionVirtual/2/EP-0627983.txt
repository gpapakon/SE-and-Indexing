Process for producing a porous shaped body by 
shaping a composition capable of being plastically 

moulded and subsequently hardened, characterized in that 
to achieve a predetermined pore structure the shaped body 

is built up in layers by repetition in order of the steps 

production of a layer of the composition having a 
pattern-like structure corresponding to the pore 

system 
hardening of the layer, 
 
where the pattern structures of the individual layers are 

transferred from corresponding masters. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the build-up of layers is carried out by means of 

screen printing. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the build-up of layers is carried out by spraying. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the transfer of the pattern structures 

and the build-up of layers is carried out under the 
control of a program. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the transfer of the pattern structures is carried 

out in digitized form. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a ceramic composition is used, with 

the step of the hardening of the layer being carried out 
by drying and the shaped body produced being sintered in 

a subsequent step. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a composition based on polymerizable  

 
organic compounds and/or organic polymer materials 

is used. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a composition based on a composite 

material comprising ceramic particles and organic polymer 
materials is used. 
Use of the process according to any of Claims 1 
to 8 for producing shape
d bodies having a three-dimensional, 
interconnecting pore system. 
Use according to Claim 9 before producing shaped 
implants having the pore system of natural bone. 
Use according to Claim 9 for producing ceramic 
catalyst supports. 
Use according to Claim 9 for producing ceramic 
filter media. 
Use according to Claim 9 for producing shaped 
ceramic sorbents for chromatography.
