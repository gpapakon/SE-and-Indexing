<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of electronically reconfigurable gate 
array (ERCGA) logic chips are interconnected via a 

reconfigurable interconnect, and electronic representations 
of large digital networks are converted to take temporary 

actual operating hardware form on the interconnected chips. 
The reconfigurable interconnect permits the digital network 

realized on the interconnected chips to be changed at will, 
making the system well suited for a variety of purposes 

including simulation, prototyping, execution and computing. 
The reconfigurable interconnect may comprise a partial 

crossbar that is formed of ERCGA chips dedicated to 
interconnection functions, wherein each such interconnect 

ERCGA is connected to at least one, but not all of the pins 
of a plurality of the logic chips. Other reconfigurable 

interconnect topologies are also detailed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of electronically reconfigurable gate array 
logic elements (ERCGAs), and more particularly relates to a methodology that includes 
interconnecting a plurality of such logic elements, and converting electronic 
representations of large digital networks into temporary actual operating hardware form 
using the interconnected logic elements for the purposes of simulation, prototyping, 
execution and/or computing. For expository convenience, the present application refers to the present invention 
as a Realizerâ„¢ system, the lexicon being devoid of a succinct descriptive name for a 
system of the type hereinafter described. The Realizer system comprises hardware and software that turns representations of 
large digital logic networks into temporary actual operating hardware form, for the 
purpose of simulation, prototyping, execution or computing. (A digital logic network is 
considered "large" when it is contains too many logic functions to be contained in a few 
of the largest available configurable logic devices.) The following discussions will be made clearer by a brief review the relevant 
terminology as it is typically (but not exclusively) used. To "realize" something is to make it real or actual. To realize all or part of a 
digital logic network or design is to cause it to take actual operating form without 
building it permanently. An "input design" is the representation of the digital logic network which is to be 
realized. It contains primitives representing combinational logic and storage, as well as 
instrumentation devices or user-supplied actual devices, and nets representing 
connections among primitive input and output pins. To "configure" a logic chip or interconnect chin is to cause its internal logic 
functions and/or interconnections to be arranged in a particular way. To configure a  
 
Realizer system for an input design is to cause its internal logic functions and 
interconnections to be arranged according to the input design. To "convert" a design is to convert its representation into a file of configuration 
data, which, when used directly to configure Realizer hardware, will cause the design to 
be realized. To "operate" a design is to cause Realizer hardware, which is configured according 
to the input design's representations, to actually operate. An "interconnect" is a reconfigurable means for passing logic signals between a 
large number of chip I/O pins as if the pins were interconnected with wires. A "path" one of the built-in
