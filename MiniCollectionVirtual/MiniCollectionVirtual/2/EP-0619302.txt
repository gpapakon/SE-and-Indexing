<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of crystallised salt-free chloro-substituted 3-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid hydrates from sulphonation mixtures containing chloro-substituted 3-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid, by mixing the sulphonation mixture with 8 to 25% by weight of aqueous sulphuric acid at 40 to 100@C, cooling the resulting suspension to 5 to 20@C, filtering off the precipitate, dissolving the precipitate using water at 30 to 100@C, optionally filtering, cooling the solution to 5 to 40@C, filtering and optionally recycling the sulphuric acid-containing filtrate.

A process for the preparation of crystalline, salt-free, 
chlorine-substituted 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 

acid hydrates from sulfonation mixtures which 
contain chlorine-substituted 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 

acid, which comprises mixing the sulfonation mixture 
with from 8 to 25% strength by weight aqueous 

sulfuric acid at from 40 to 100°C, cooling the 
resulting suspension to from 5 to 20°C, filtering 

off the precipitate and dissolving it with water at 
from 30 to 100°C, carrying out filtration if 

desired, cooling the solution to from 5 to 40°C and 
filtering it, and recycling the sulfuric acid-containing 

filtrate if desired. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
sulfonation mixture contains 6-chloro-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 

acid or 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 
acid, in particular 6-chloro-3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 

acid, as chlorine-substituted 3-nitrobenzenesulfonic 
acid. 
The process as claimed in either or both of claims 
1 and 2, wherein the sulfonation mixture is mixed 

with from 10 to 20% strength by weight, in 
particular from 10 to 15% strength by weight, 

aqueous sulfuric acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the sulfonation mixture is mixed with  

 
aqueous sulfuric acid at from 45 to 65°C, in particular 

from 50 to 60°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the suspension which is obtained is 

cooled to from 10 to 18°C, in particular from 12 to 
16°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the precipitate is dissolved with water 

at from 50 to 60°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, wherein the solution is cooled initially to from 

25 to 35°C and subsequently to from 5 to 15°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the sulfuric acid-containing filtrate is 

mixed with the sulfonation mixture.
