<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a recreational surface for games
such as soccer, hockey and American Football for example
and also horse-racing tracks for example as is described by WO-A-9 213
138, according to the preamble of claim 1.The conventional surface for such activities as mentioned
above is turf. Normal turf, whilst highly satisfactory
under ideal conditions does have some serious disadvantages.
In dry seasons or times of drought it can
become very hard with risk of injury to falling players.
In wet seasons it can become waterlogged making it unpleasant
to use and very susceptible to damage. In very
cold conditions it can become frozen and again hard and
injurious.Ideally, a recreational surface for these purposes should
be compliant under all conditions.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
recreational surface of grass which overcomes the problems
associated with conventional turf.According to the present invention a recreational surface
comprises grass growing on a coherent substrate of bonded 
rubber crumb having substantial voidage therein, said
coherent substrate lying between a layer of planting
medium on top of said coherent substrate and a layer of
root zone sand lying below said coherent substrate,
wherein the voidage in the coherent
substrate is filled with root zone growing medium with the
roots of the grass penetrating said root zone growing
medium, characterised in that the size of the rubber crumb is
greater than 8 mm and not more than 20 mm in order to more efficiently
hydraulically connect said root zone and said planting
zone.The root zone growing medium may comprise sand, loam,
peat, other organic material or mixtures thereof.The layer of planting medium is preferably particulate
material and up to 5cm in thickness.The planting medium may consist of a commercial root zone/
top dressing mixture or an appropriate blend of sandy loam
topsoil and root zone sand.For guidance, a mixture of sand and loamy soil should
produce the following sieve analysis to British Standard
BS 1377:75:- 
Sieve size (mm)% by mass passing2.098-1001.095-1000.565-1000.12510-1000.1632-5The organic matter content should be in the range 1-4% and
typically 2%.The crumb may be of SBR, EPDM, natural rubber or mixtures
thereof, and may be comprised by recycled vehicle tyres or
perimeter seals.The binder may be a polyurethane resin.The grass may be grown from seed sown onto the substrate
or topping or provided by turves laid on the substrate.The grass will be selected in accordance with intended use
and

<CLAIMS>
A recreational surface comprising grass (16) growing
on a coherent substrate (14) of bonded rubber crumb having

substantial voidage therein, said coherent substrate (14)
lying between a layer (15) of a planting medium on top of

said coherent substrate (14) and a layer (13) of root zone
sand lying below said coherent substrate,

wherein the voidage in the coherent substrate (14) is filled
with root zone growing medium with the roots of the grass

penetrating said root zone growing medium, characterised in that the
size of the rubber crumb is greater than 8 mm and not more than 20 mm in order

to more efficiently hydraulically connect the root zone
and the planting zone.
A recreational surface according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the root zone growing medium

comprises sand, loam, peat or other organic material or
mixtures thereof.
A recreational surface according to Claim 1 or Claim
2, characterised in that the layer of planting medium is a

particulate material of up to 5cm thickness.
A recreational surface according to any of Claims 1 
1 to 3, characterised in that the coherent substrate (14)

is in a layer having a thickness of between 5mm and 50mm.
A recreational surface according to any of Claims 1

to 4, characterised in that the rubber crumb of said
coherent substrate (14) is of SBR, EPDM, natural rubber or

mixtures thereof.
A recreational surface according to any preceding
Claim, characterised in that the grass is grown from seed.
A recreational surface according to any of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the grass is provided by

turves.
A recreational surface according to Claim 3,
characterised in that the particulate planting medium

comprises a commercial root zone/top dressing mixture or a
blend of sandy loam topsoil and root zone sand.
A recreational surface according to any preceding
Claim, characterised in that the surface is in the form of

tile-like units which can be lifted and laid as required.
