<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for processing
chopped fibres, and, more particularly, to a method and
apparatus for chopping or cutting one or more essentially
continuous tows, each consisting of individual strands, into
relatively short fibres of predetermined length which are
dispensed at an accurately controlled feed rate onto or into
a substrate such as the nonwoven pad of a hygienic article.GB-A-2034772 discloses an apparatus for chopping
different types of fibre simultaneously to different respective
lengths, the strands of fibres being supplied by tubes with
air-entrainment devices therein to a rotary cutting cylinder
with cutting blades spaced around its periphery, wherein the
uniform spacing between the cutting blades in one portion of
the length of the cutting cylinder is smaller than the uniform
spacing between the blades in another portion of its length,
so that fibres supplied to the first portion are chopped to a
smaller length than fibres supplied to the other portion. This prior art forms the preamble of independent claims 1 and 26.It is among the objectives of this invention to provide
a method and apparatus for depositing highly moisture-absorbent
material into the nonwoven layer or pad of hygienic articles
such as disposable diapers which substantially reduce loss of
moisture-absorbent material, which eliminates unwanted
migration of moisture-absorbent material within the finished
article, which provides for rapid absorbency of bodily fluids
or other moisture and which provides 
an accurately metered volume of moisture-absorbent material.In accordance with the invention, these objectives are
accomplished in apparatus for forming and dispensing chopped
fibres from continuous tows formed of a plurality of strands
comprising means for independently feeding at least two tows
into a cutter mechanism comprising cutter means operable to cut
each of the tows to form chopped fibres, and means for pumping
the chopped fibres to dispensing means, characterised in that
means are provided for sensing the feed rates of each of the
tows into the cutter mechanism, and in that control means are
provided which are adapted, in response to the sensed feed
rates, to vary independently the feed rates at which the
individual tows are fed into the cutter mechanism.In an embodiment in accordance with the invention, at
least two tows are independently fed to a venturi pump and
associated cutter mechanism where the tows are cut or chopped
into relatively short lengths to form chopped fibres, and are
then
