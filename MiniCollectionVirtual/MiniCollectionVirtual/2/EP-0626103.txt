<ABSTRACT>
An electrical conductor terminating arrangement such as an electrical connector comprises contact-making means (31) (e.g. compressible clamping collett) which makes good contact with an electrical conductor (44) in response to axial pressure displacement over the contact-making means (31) of displaceable means (35) to exert a radial force on the contact-making means (31) and to co-operate therewith for providing ongoing pressure engagement between the contact-making means (31) and the electrical conductor (44) without the need for the continuance of axial pressure on the displaceable means after a predetermined axial displacement of the displaceable means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical conductor 
terminating arrangements which are especially, but not 
exclusively, applicable to the termination of electrical 
conductors in electrical connectors of the coaxial type. The invention is especially directed to an improved 
conductor terminating arrangement in a coaxial connector of 
the kind facilitating the ready and effective connection of 
the usual central conductor of an incoming coaxial cable to 
contact means (e.g. pin contact) of the connector without 
the need for crimping and/or other tools. A coaxial connector is known from USA Patent 
Specification Number 3761870 in which the central conductor 
is secured to a clamping member by the action of an axial 
force which is exerted upon assembly of the connector by 
means of a nut which is threadably connected to the 
connector body. The nut causes a clamping member to be 
axially displaced which clamping member has a bevelled end 
Surface which cooperates with the periphery of a mushroom 
shaped resilient dielectric element which has a through 
channel that fits over the clamping member. The axial force 
causes radial inward depression on the clamping member to 
effect clamping of the conductor. When the axial pressure 
is removed, for example upon the disassembly of the 
connector, the radially inward depression is terminated and 
the electrical and mechanical integrity between the clamping 
member and the conductor is no longer maintained and they  
 
are easily separable. Another coaxial connector is known from USA Patent 
Specification Number 3847 463 in which the central conductor 
is secured within a collet having a bevelled end. This is 
effected by cooperation with a collet closer which has a 
bevelled recess, conforming with the bevel of the collet, 
the two bevelled surfaces cooperating upon relative axial 
displacement into engagement to clamp the conductor. The 
relative axial displacement is effected during assembly of 
the connector by screwing action between a cable nut and an 
outer conductor. The clamping action is dependent upon the 
axial force exerted by the relative axial displacement and 
removal of that axial force by unscrewing of the cable nut 
permits the separation of the collet and collet closer 
thereby failing to maintain electrical and mechanical 
integrity between the collet and the conductor. The present invention seeks to provide a connector in 
which electrical and mechanical integrity is maintained when 
an axial clamping force is removed so that the connector can
