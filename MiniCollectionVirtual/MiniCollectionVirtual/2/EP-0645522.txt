<ABSTRACT>
A fluid impeller blade with lowered stress 
and increased useful life has an edge extending from 

the hub of the blade and forming, in part, a boundary 
for axial fluid flow. The edge, at least at its 

extremity, is spaced axially into the blade, at an 
angle of about 0.5° to about 20° from the radial line 

through the edge at the hub of the blade, whereby the 
mass of blade material exerting centrifugal force on 

the edge at the blade hub during rotation of the 
impeller is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation in part of application 
Serial Number 07/872,345 filed April 23, 1992. This invention relates generally to blades in 
a shrouded radial flow turbine impeller, and, more 
particularly, to an improved turbine blade with reduced 
centrifugal stress and improved useful life. Radial flow impellers find application in gas 
turbine engines where they are used as compressor 
impellers and turbine impellers. Another application 
is in the expansion of gases for cooling in 
refrigeration plants and in gas liquefication plants. 
Radial flow impellers are greatly subject to structural 
constrictions in design because of aerodynamic 
considerations. In a radial turbine impeller, gas flows into 
the impeller in a radial direction, entering channels 
formed by the impeller hub and the impeller blades. 
Typically, to achieve high aerodynamic performance, the 
impeller blades at their outer extremities have an 
integral shroud which forms the outer boundary of the 
fluid flow channels. The gas is expanded and turned in 
the impeller from the radial direction to discharge in 
the axial direction. Thus, the discharge face of the 
impeller is a generally radial plane, and the blades 
edges are radial. The blade edges define a large exit 
area for the expanded axial flow. Consequently, this 
face is termed the impeller eye. To provide the large 
exit area, the blade edges have a large radial span.  
 
Since these edges in a turbine impeller are trailing 
edges, they must be thin to provide good aerodynamic 
performance. Stresses concentrate at the hub of the blade 
at the trailing edge. This location is therefore 
susceptible to cracking, and is critical in 
establishing the cyclic life of the impeller. 
Centrifugal stress is a large portion of the total 
stress at this critical location. The outer shroud is 
a large contributor to this centrifugal stress. 
Unshrouded impellers, on the other hand, do not 
experience such severe stress at this critical 
location, but have the disadvantage of significantly 
poorer aerodynamic performance. The prior art has attempted to reduce 
stresses at the critical location by configuring the 
blade geometry. One technique has been simply to use 
thick trailing edges with attendant poorer aerodynamic 
performance. To reduce the aerodynamic performance 
penalty, the thickness of the blade trailing edge has 
also been tapered, that is, progressively reduced in 
thickness from the hub of the blade to the tip of the 
blade. Stress is reduced in that the mass of blade 
mat
