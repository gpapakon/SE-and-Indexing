<ABSTRACT>
A method for high speed packet data transmission on a 
conventional cellular voice network (5,10). This method 

assigns several voice channels (N+1) to be used as high 
speed packet data channels (1-N) and it assigns one channel 

to be used as a digital data control channel. Special high 
rate data phones (1-N) are periodically required to transmit 

data. The digital data control channel is examined (122) 
for an available data channel within a cell. The available 

data channel is then attempted to be seized (46-50) for 
transmission. If unsuccessful, the high rate data phone 

tries again (54-56) within a matter of a few seconds. If 
successful, the high rate data phone transmits (112) its 

data and releases the data channel for subsequent use by 
other high rate data phones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to digital data 
transmission on cellular networks and more particularly to 
high volume packet data transmission on a cellular voice 
communication system. Modern cellular telecommunication systems are 
predominantly voice telecommunication systems. However, the 
demand for increased digital data to be carried on these 
systems is growing. Typically digital data is packetized before being 
transmitted by telecommunication system. These packets may 
be of fixed or variable length and are typically relatively 
short messages, between .02 and 10 seconds. Voice 
communications in such cellular telecommunication systems is 
typically in multiples of minutes. Existing cellular digital data telecommunication 
systems are basically telephones coupled via modems. The 
call setup time for such modem transmission of data is on 
the order of approximately 1 to 5 seconds. Although this 
time is suitable for cellular call setups, it restricts data 
transmission rates to sub hertz values. Applications 
typically require data rates 2 and 3 orders of magnitude 
greater. In addition, 1 to 5 second setup times are greater 
than most packet data transmission times. New systems for 
facilitating the transmission of digital data in cellular 
telecommunications may be designed; however, providing new 
infrastructure for such systems which are now served by 
standard cellular telecommunications is not cost effective. 
Other telecommunication systems may operate by stealing time 
from conventional cellular channels. That is, such systems 
would have their digital cellular phone equipment transmit  
 
at very low power levels in the existing cellular voice 
channels. The transmission packet bursts would be 
relatively short in duration. However if a conventional 
voice transmission was assigned to the particular channel, 
the power level would be substantially greater than the low 
level of the packet data transmitter and the packet data 
transmitter would be over-ridden by or programmed to drop 
off the channel. However, since such systems are stealing 
time from voice channels they would be inefficient and 
unreliable for digital data throughput. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide a 
digital data packet transmission arrangement for increasing 
digital data rate transmission which operates either in full 
compatibility with or integrated within existing 
conventional cellular voice telecommunication systems. In accordance with the present invention, a novel 
method for an
