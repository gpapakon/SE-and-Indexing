<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to compositions for the prevention or treatment of
bacterial infections in a mammal's udder, and more particularly to composition for the prevention
or treatment of bovine mastitis, including both "subclinical mastitis" and "clinical
mastitis."Bacterial infections, particularly bovine mastitis, are the most costly,
complex and difficult challenge to the dairy industry. In the United States alone,
mastitis costs dairy farmers close to $3 billion a year, or about $300 per cow.Mastitis is defined as an inflammation of the mammary gland, and
occurs primarily as a result of infection by bacteria which gain entry to the udder
via the teat canal. Mastitis is recognized to exist in two forms, "subclinical," where
the infection is not directly evident by visual or physical inspection of either the
milk or the mammary gland, and "clinical," which is diagnosed by the presence of
visually detectable alterations in the milk (clots, discoloration) and glands
(swollen, firm, warm, painful). Elevated levels of white cells in the milk, in
response to the infection, are characteristic of mastitis. The common demarcation
of 500,000 white cells per milliliter of milk separates "subclinical" and "clinical"
mastitis.It has been estimated that about 20 cases of subclinical mastitis
occur for every case that, untreated, generally develops into overt clinical mastitis.
Both subclinical and clinical forms affect milk production. Depending on the
severity of the subclinical form, the production of milk by an infected cow can be
as much as 20% less than that of a non-infected cow, and cases of subclinical
disease can last for several months. On the other hand, the milk from a clinically-mastitic
cow must be discarded, and in some cases the cow has to be destroyed (if
the disease resists treatment). The cow may even die, often within 24 hours,
following infection with certain coliform organisms.Prior attempts to treat the mastitis infection have involved the
infusion of an antibiotic into the udder (in the case of the clinical disease). Since
treatment is commonly instituted prior to identification of the specific causative 
organism, it is important to select an antimicrobial which offers the greatest range
of efficacy against the array of pathogens causing mastitis. Although certain
organisms, such as Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, are the
principle pathogens associated with infectious mastitis, a great number of
environmental and contagious microorganisms are also known to

<CLAIMS>
A composition for infusion into the mammary gland of a female
animal to prevent bacterial infection therein, said composition comprising chlorine

dioxide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the molar ratio of chlorine
dioxide to any residual chlorite in the composition is at least 5:1, and wherein said composition

has a pH compatible with the inner udder compartment and is isotonic.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the chlorine dioxide is present
in the composition in an amount ranging from 5 ppm to 1000 ppm.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the chlorine dioxide is present
in the composition in an amount ranging from 40 ppm to 400 ppm.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier is isotonic saline.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the composition further
includes a wetting agent.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the molar ratio of chlorine
dioxide to any residual chlorite in the composition is at least 7.5:1.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the molar ratio of chlorine
dioxide to any residual chlorite in the composition is at least 10:1.
The composition of claim 1 wherein in the composition is formed
immediately prior to infusion by reacting a chlorine dioxide liberating compound with

an aqueous acid at a pH below 7 in the presence of chloride ion.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the composition is formed
immediately prior to infusion by combining a chlorine dioxide solution which has been

stored at a pH below 5.5 with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
