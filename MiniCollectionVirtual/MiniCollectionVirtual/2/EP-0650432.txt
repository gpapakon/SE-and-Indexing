<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a device for altering the length of a pedal crank which can be integrated into the pedal hub of new bicycles or fitted to that of used bicycles by means of an adapter. The device makes it possible to lengthen the pedal lever arm during the phase of greatest force transmission. The essential novelty of this device resides in the fact that a specially designed spindle (1) is provided which can accept gears (30, 31, 32) acting on a rim gear (21) fitted in a bearing unit (20). The spindle (1) is arranged inside the bearing unit (20) coaxially with a shaft (33) which bears the gear (32) and two crank arms (52) of two thrust crank drives to lengthen the pedals (60) secured to moving parts (48, 49). The moving parts (48, 49) slide on inner parts (46, 47) which are firmly secured to the spindle (1) via flanges (43, 44). The transmission ratio is such that the crank arms (52) complete two revolutions per pedal revolution.

Device for altering the length of a pedal arm, in
particular for bicycles, the arm of each pedal consisting of

an inner part and an outer part, characterized in that the
pedal is fastened on the outer part (48, 49) and the inner

part (46, 47) is rigidly connected to a spindle (1) fitted in
a bearing body (20), and the outer part (48, 49) slides on the

inner past (46, 47) and is driven by a lever system (52, 53)
moved by a shaft (33), and wherein the spindle (1) is

orientated coaxially to the shaft (33) and is connected to it
by a gear mechanism consisting of a gear-wheel (32) rigidly

connected to the shaft (33), two gear-wheels (30, 31) rigidly
coupled to one another and mounted in the spindle (1) and a

toothed ring (21) rigidly connected to the bearing body (20),
one of the gear-wheels (31) mounted in the spindle (1)

engaging with the gear-wheel (32) connected to the shaft (33)
and the other of the gear-wheels (30) mounted in the spindle

(1) engaging with the toothed ring (21).
Device for altering the length of a pedal arm, in
particular for bicycles, the arm of each pedal consisting of

an inner part and on outer part, characterized in that the
pedal is fastened on the outer part (48, 49) and the inner

part (46, 47) is rigidly connected to a spindle (1) fitted in
a bearing body (20), and the outer part (48, 49) slides on the

inner part (46, 47) and is driven by a lever system (52, 53)
moved by a shaft (33), and wherein the spindle (1) is

orientated coaxially to the shaft (33) and is connected to it
by a gear mechanism consisting of a gear-wheel (32) rigidly

connected to the shaft (33), two gear-wheels (30, 31) rigidly
coupled to one another and mounted in the spindle (1) and a

gear-wheel rigidly connected to one of the two covers (26, 27)
of the bearing body (20), this gear-wheel engaging with a

satellite wheel and optionally driving a number of other gear-wheels
so the shaft (33) performs twice as many rotations as

the satellite wheel. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the spindle (1) consists of two hubs (2, 3) which are

connected to one another by one or more webs or walls (3', 4)
and are provided at the outer ends with sockets for flanges

(43, 44) and have a continuous bore (6) which is equipped with
an internal thread (9) at the respective outer ends.
Device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in
that the gear-wheels (30, 31) mounted in the spindle (1) are

arranged on a shaft (14) mounted in bores (12, 13) inside the
spindle (1).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the spindle (1) is provided with

continuous bores (6) in which the shaft (33) is mounted by
means of rolling or sliding bearings (8) and in which bearing

seats (7) for receiving the bearing (8) are formed.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that bearing seats (15, 16; 28, 29) for

receiving ball bearings (17, 18) are formed on the spindle (1)
and on the bearing body (20) or on covers (26, 27) which can

be connected to the bearing body (20).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
ratio between the number of teeth of the various gear-wheels

(30, 31, 32) and the toothed ring (21) is maintained such that
the shaft (33) and the gear-wheel (32) rigidly connected

thereto rotate at twice the speed of the spindle (1).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the shaft (33) has, at its ends, crank

arms (52) rigidly connected thereto and imparts to them a
speed which is twice as high as that of the pedals (60, 61) so

the associated crank arm (52) performs two complete rotations
during each complete rotation of a pedal (60, 61). 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that each
crank arm (52) is rotatably connected to a connecting rod (53)

by a peg (54), wherein the connecting rod (53) is articulated
to the movable past (48, 49) of the associated pedal arm by a

further peg (55) so the pedal arm is displaceable along the
inner part (46, 47), the maximum value of the extension of the

pedal arm being obtained during the phase of maximum exertion
of force.
Device according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that,
during half a rotation of the pedal (63, 61), the pedal arm

slides from its minimum length to the maximum length, the
crank arm (52) performing a complete rotation, whereas the

crank arm (52) again performs a complete rotation during the
next half rotation of the pedal (60, 61) and the pedal (60,

61) passes into its starting position again.
