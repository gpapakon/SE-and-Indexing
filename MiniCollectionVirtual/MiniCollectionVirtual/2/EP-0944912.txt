<ABSTRACT>
Portions (40 and 44) of a structure, such as a flat-panel display, are positioned such that a sealing area (40S) of one portion is at least partially separated from a corresponding sealing area (44S) of another portion such that a gap (48) at least partially separates the two sealing areas, typically by height of 25 microns or more. Energy is applied in a "gap jumping technique" to locally heat material of at least one portion along the sealing area such that the material bridges the gap and seals the portions (40 and 44) together. A laser is typically employed to locally melt and draw the material into the gap by a combination of factors such as surface tension and capillary action. A first part of the gap jumping technique may be performed in a non-vacuum environment to tack the portions together, but the gap jumping technique is typically completed in a vacuum to form an evacuated panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GAP JUMPING TO SEAL STRUCTUREFIELD OF USE This invention relates to techniques for sealing structures, particularly flat-panel devices. This invention also relates to techniques for tacking structures, such as flat-panel devices, typically as part of structure sealing operations.BACKGROUND ARTA flat-panel device contains a pair of generally flat plates connected together through an intermediate mechanism. The two plates are typically rectangular in shape. The thickness of the relatively flat-structure formed with the two plates and the intermediate connecting mechanism is small compared to the diagonal length of either plate.When used for displaying information, a flat-panel device is typically referred to as a flat-panel display. The two plates in a flat-panel display are commonly termed the faceplate (or frontplate) and the baseplate (or backplate) . The faceplate, which provides the viewing surface for the information, is part of a faceplate structure containing one or more layers formed over the faceplate. The baseplate is similarly part of a baseplate structure containing one or more layers formed over the baseplate . The faceplate structure and the baseplate structure are sealed together, typically through an outer wall, to form a sealed enclosure.A flat-panel display utilizes mechanisms such as cathode rays (electrons) , plasmas, and liquid crystals to display information on the faceplate. Flat-panel displays that employ these three mechanisms are generally referred to as cathode-ray tube ("CRT") displays, plasma displays, and liquid-crystal displays. 

The constituency and arrangement of the display's faceplate structure and baseplate structure depend on the type of mechanism utilized to display information on the faceplate. In a flat-panel CRT display, electron-emissive elements are typically provided over the interior surface of the baseplate. The electron-emissive elements are arranged in a matrix of rows and columns of picture elements (pixels) . Each pixel typically contains a large number of individual electron-emissive elements. When the electron-emissive elements are appropriately excited, they emit electrons that strike phosphors arranged in corresponding pixels situated over the interior surface of the faceplate. The faceplate in a flat-panel CRT display consists of a transparent material such as glass. Upon being struck by electrons emitted from the electron-emissive elements, the phosphors situated over the interior surface of the faceplate emit light visible on the exterior surface
