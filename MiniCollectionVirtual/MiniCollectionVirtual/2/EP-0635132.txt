<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antigens used to prevent, diagnose, or treat Staphylococcus infections. This invention also relates to a purified culture of Staphylococcus organisms and a method for obtaining broadly reactive opsonic Immunoglobulin useful for treating a coagulase negative Staphylococcus Infection.Over the last two decades, Staphylococcus infections have become important causes of human morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitalized patients. Because of their prevalence on the skin and mucosal linings, Staphylococci are ideally situated to produce infections, both localized and systemic. Debilitated or immunosuppressed patients are at extreme risk of systemic infection.The Staphylococcus species most frequently pathogenic in humans are Staphylococcusaureus and Staphylococcusepidermidis, and each includes a number of serotypes. Both groups have developed resistance to antibiotics, the current treatment of choice. In recent years, S. epidermidis has become a major cause of nosocomial infection in patients whose treatments include the placement of foreign objects such as cerebrospinal fluid shunts, cardiac valves, vascular catheters, joint prostheses, and other implants into the body. S. epidermidis is also a common cause of post-operative wound infections and peritonitis in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. One form of treatment for kidney failure entails the introduction of large volumes of peritoneal dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity which carries the risk of frequent and recurrent infections. In a similar manner, patients with impaired immunity and those receiving parenteral nutrition through central venous catheters are at high risk for developing S. epidermidis sepsis as well (C.C. Patrick, J. Pediatr., 116:497 (1990)).S. epidermidis has also become a common cause of neonatal nosocomial sepsis. Infections frequently occur in premature infants that have received parenteral nutrition which can be a direct or indirect source of contamination. Such infections are difficult to treat for a variety of reasons. Resistance to antibiotics is common. In one study, the majority of staphylococci isolated from blood cultures of septic infants were multiply resistant to antibiotics (A. Fleer et al., Pediatr. Infect. Dis. 2:426 (1983)). Stimulation of the immune system provides little relief because such infants have impaired immunity resulting from deficiencies in antibodies, complement, and neutrophil function. Moreover, lipid infusion, which is now a standard
