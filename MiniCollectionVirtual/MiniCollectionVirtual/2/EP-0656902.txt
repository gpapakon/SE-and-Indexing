<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of a series of 
tri- and tetra-polypeptides whose sequence is unrelated to 
the sequences of proteins of known mammalian lung 
surfactants, the preparation of mixtures of these 
polypeptides with hydrophobic extensions, and the method 
for production of the same and pharmaceutical compositions 
which are effective in the treatment of mammalian 
respiratory distress syndrome. Infantile respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a 
leading cause of death in the first 28 days of life. It 
strikes 1 in 100 babies worldwide and about 10 percent die. 
The syndrome rarely occurs in term infants but is generally 
associated with immaturity and in low-birth weight (under 2 
kg). Adult RDS shows similar clinical characteristics and 
pathophysiology as the infantile disease and is managed in 
the intensive care facility in a similar fashion. The 
adult disease has diverse etiologies and results from lung 
insults such as diffuse infections, aspiration of the 
gastric contents or water, inhalation of irritants 
and toxins and pulmonary edema arising from such sources as  
 
narcotic overdose. RDS is correlated with an absence or 
dysfunction of the lung surfactant which coats the alveoli 
of the lungs where gas exchange occurs. Lung surfactant is composed primarily of lipid (90%) and 
contains a minor component of various proteins (10%). The 
primary lipid type is phospholipid which constitutes 97% of 
the lipid. 80% of this phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine 
(PC) and 10% is phosphatidyglycerol (PG). 70-80% of the 
phospholipid acyl chains are saturated and 85-90% of these 
are 16-carbons in length. The major lipid is 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The protein 
component of lung surfactant is also heterogeneous but more 
poorly characterized. The major protein is ∼32kd and its 
sequence has been predicted from its cDNA (White et al. 
(1985) Nature 317, 361-363) and it has been cloned (Floros, 
et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry (1985) 260, 495-500). 
Minor proteins of lower molecular weight have also 
been isolated and several sequences have been reported 
(Warr, et al. (1987) Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences USA 82, 7315-7919; Glasser, et al. (1988) Journal 
of Biological Chemistry 263, 9; Johansson, et al. (1988) 
FEBS Letters. 232, 61-64; Glasser, et al. (1987)

4007; Revak, et al. (1988) Journal of Clinical 
Investigation 81, 826-833). Infantile RDS has been treated with animal lung
