<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to multilayered, heat-sealable, recycled film comprising at least one scrap layer and a heat-sealable layer, where     - the film is thermoformable, - the scrap layer comprises polyamide (nylon)/polyolefin recyclate and an adhesion promoter, where the recyclate content in the scrap layer is from 60 to 98% by weight, - the recyclate has a polyamide content of from 3 to 45% by weight, and - the heat-sealable layer has a single- or multilayer structure and comprises polyolefinic polymer or copolymer, where the layers can be identical or different.

A multi-layer sealable recycled film comprising one
layer of scrap and one sealing layer, characterised in

that

the film is deep-drawable,
the scrap layer comprises recycled polyamide/polyolefin
and a primer, the proportion of

recycled material in the scrap layer being 60 to
98 wt.% and the proportion of primer being 2 to

20 wt.%,
the recycled material has a polyamide content of
3 to 45 wt.% and
the sealing layer is in one or more layers and
made of polyolefinic polymer or copolymer, the

layers optionally being the same or different.
A film according to claim 1, characterised in that the
film is made by adhesive lamination, extrusion, co-extrusion,

and extrusion coating and/or extrusion
lining, the film optionally contains intermediate

layers of primer.
A film according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the polyolefinic polymer or copolymer in the

sealing layer is a polyethylene, polypropylene,
polypropylene copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate

copolymer, ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer,
ethylene/methylene acrylic acid copolymer or ionomer

or a blend of the aforementioned polymers. 
A film according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the recycled material is regenerated,

regranulated or agglomerated on the basis of
polyamide/polyolefin film waste or is a mixture of two

or three of the aforementioned recycled materials.
A film according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the polyamide consists of aliphatic polyamides

such as PA 6, PA 11, PA 12, PA 66, PA 6.66, PA 6.8,
PA 6.9, PA 6.10, PA 6.11 or PA 6.12, or a copolymer of

the monomer units therein or a mixture of the
aforementioned aliphatic polyamides.
A film according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the primer is an anhydride-modified polyolefin or

an anhydride-modified ethylene/vinyl acetate
copolymer.
A film according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the scrap layer makes up 30 to 90%, preferably

50 to 70% and the sealing layer makes up 10 to 70%,
preferably 30 to 50%, of the thickness of the film

comprising the scrap layer and the sealing layer.
A film according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the film has a total thickness of 0.050 to

0.500 mm, preferably 0.080 to 0.400 mm.
A film according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that at least one layer is coloured and/or printed.
Use of the film according to any of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the film is used as packaging

for industrial medical equipment, semi-finished 
products and finished products or for packaging of

food.
