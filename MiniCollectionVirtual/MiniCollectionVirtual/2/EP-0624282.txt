<ABSTRACT>
An improved Fermi FET structure with low gate and diffusion capacity allows conduction carriers to flow within the channel at a predetermined depth in the substrate below the gate, without requiring an inversion layer to be created at the surface of the semiconductor. The low capacity Fermi FET is preferably implemented using a Fermi Tub having a predetermined depth, and with a conductivity type opposite the substrate conductivity type and the same conductivity type as the drain and source diffusions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Field Effect 
Transistor devices and more particularly to high speed 
Field Effect Transistors having reduced gate and 
diffusion capacitance. Field Effect Transistors (FET) have become 
the dominant active device for very large scale 
integration (VLSI) and ultra large scale integration 
(ULSI) applications, because the integrated circuit FET 
is by nature a high impedance, high density, low power 
device. Much research and development activity has 
focused on improving speed and density of FET's, and on 
lowering the power consumption thereof. U.S. Patents 
4,984,043 and 4,990,974, both to the present inventor 
Albert W. Vinal, and both entitled Fermi Threshold 
Field Effect Transistor, describe a high speed, metal 
oxide semiconductor (MOS) FET which has a threshold 
voltage which is independent of insulator thickness, 
channel length, drain voltage, substrate doping and 
temperature to provide a high speed FET. However, 
notwithstanding the vast improvement of the Fermi 
threshold FET compared to known MOS devices, there is a  
 
continuing need to lower the capacitance of the Fermi 
FET structure. German Offenlegungsschrift DE 31 38 747 
describes a depletion-mode field-effect transistor according to the preamble of claim 1 
having a depletion region (10) between the source 
region (2) and drain region (3) which has the same 
conductivity type as the latter, and additional 
semiconductor regions (11 and 12) between the source 
region (2) and the drain region (3), which have the 
same conductivity type as the latter and which form a 
common, flat p-n junction (13) with the substrate. It is therefore an object of the invention to 
provide an improved Fermi threshold Field Effect 
Transistor (FET). It is another object of the invention to 
provide a Fermi threshold FET with reduced gate and 
diffusion capacitance. These and other objects are provided, 
according to the present invention, by providing a 
Fermi-FET structure which allows conduction carriers to 
flow within the channel at a predetermined depth in the 
substrate below the gate, without requiring an 
inversion layer to be created at the surface of the 
semiconductor in order to support carrier conduction. 
Accordingly, the average depth of the channel charge 
requires inclusion of the dielectric constant of the 
substrate to calculate gate capacity. Gate capacity is 
thereby reduced. The low capacity Fermi FET is preferably 
implemented using a Fermi Tub region having 
predetermined depth, and with a conductivity
