<ABSTRACT>
A rechargeable battery is charged by connecting the terminals of the battery to an electrical power source. In order to avoid overcharging and undue temperature increase in the battery cell, the course of at least one charging parameter is surveyed during at least part of the process of charging the battery. This charging parameter surveyed is compared with a number of reference parameter courses representing idealistic or desirable processes of charging the battery for different starting states of the battery. In order to determine the starting state of the battery and thus selecting a reference parameter course, the battery may initially be test charged for a short period of time and subsequently test discharged for another short period of time. The comparisons may for example be made by means of a microprocessor, which may also select the reference course. Thereafter the process of charging the battery may be controlled so as to approximate the course of said charging parameter to the selected reference course. The invention also relates to a method of determining characteristic parameters of the battery which may be used to control a subsequent charging process. Such characteristic parameters may be the capacity of the battery, the maximum charging temperature and the maximum charging voltage. The invention further relates to a battery and a battery system wherein the battery may comprise information means for storing battery information. Such information means may for example be an electronic memory or a microprocessor.

<DESCRIPTION>
When charging a rechargeable battery, such as for example an
NiCd battery, an electrical voltage greater than the terminal
voltage of the battery is applied to the terminals of the
battery, whereby a current will flow through the battery.
This current initiates a chemical process by which energy is
stored in the battery.When the battery has reached a full charge condition, the
chemical process stops, and the added energy will instead be
converted into heat. Since the battery is constructed as a
sealed container, the pressure in the battery increases,
which causes chemical destruction. This means that the capacity
of the battery is reduced, and the capacity may eventually
have been reduced significantly after several such
chargings. For the battery to be utilized in the best possible
manner it is therefore important to ensure not only
that the battery will be charged fully, but also that charging
is interrupted before the generation of heat becomes too
great. Thus, it would be desirable to control the charging
process so as to obtain an almost optimum charging and/or to
interrupt charging at a proper time. Such accurate control of
the charging process is especially important when it is
desired to charge the battery as quickly as possible.In a typical charging process the voltage across the battery
increases evenly as the battery is charged. As the battery
approaches its full state of charge, the voltage increases
more steeply to a peak marking the full state of charge. The
voltage then drops again owing to the increase in temperature
because the temperature coefficient of the voltage is negative.
Correspondingly, the charging current typically falls
to a minimum at full charge and then increases. A charging
process of this type may be seen from WO 92/15142.A method of charging a re-chargeable
battery having a pair of terminals
may comprise connecting an electrical power source to the 
terminals of the battery, surveying the value and/or course
of a least one characteristic parameter of the charging
process during at least part of the process of charging the
battery, comparing the value and/or course of said at least
one charging parameter with corresponding values and/or
courses of stored reference parameters representing idealistic
or desirable charging processes for different types of
battery and/or different battery conditions, selecting based
on said comparison one of said stored sets of reference
parameters, and controlling at least part of the process of
charging the battery on the basis of one or
