<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus (15) for handling masonry blocks (1), having a suspension means (18) by means of which the apparatus can be suspended on a lifting apparatus which serves for moving the apparatus (15) up and down and for pivoting the same. In order to design said apparatus such that one or more masonry blocks (1) can, in a simple manner and with little exertion, be simultaneously lifted, rotated about a horizontal axis, moved to the point of installation and set down there and/or added to an existing masonry work arrangement, the apparatus comprises an elongate block carrier (22) which is connected to the suspension means such that it extends approximately horizontally in the suspension position. In this arrangement, the block carrier has a free end which can be introduced into at least one duct which is formed in the masonry block and extends into the latter in the direction of an axis which is horizontal in the installation position of the masonry block.
