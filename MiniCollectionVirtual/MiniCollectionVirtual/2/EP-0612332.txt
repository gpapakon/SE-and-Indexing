Metal/plastics composite containing inorganic 
fillers, in which composite a thermoplastics film 

consisting of polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters, 
polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, 

polyurethanes or polycarbonates and bonded to a metal 
sheet of a thickness from 0.04 to 1 mm contains at 

least 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 
6% by weight, based on the total weight of the mixture 

of thermoplastics and filler, of one or more metal 
powders, selected from aluminium powder, magnesium 

powder, zinc powder and manganese powder. 
Metal/plastics composite containing inorganic 
fillers, in which composite an adhesion promoter layer 

bonding a thermoplastics film consisting of 
polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters, polyvinyl 

chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyurethanes or 
polycarbonates to a metal sheet of a thickness from 

0.04 to 1 mm contains at least 0.1% by weight, 
preferably 0.5 to 6% by weight, based on the total 

weight of the mixture of adhesion promoter and filler, 
of one or more metal powders, selected from aluminium 

powder, magnesium powder, zinc powder and manganese 
powder, the adhesion promoter layer being formed by the 

use of copolymers, terpolymers, graft copolymers or 
ionomers which contain carboxyl groups or anhydride 

groups or groups which can be hydrolysed to carboxyl 
groups, or the adhesion promoter layer being formed by 

the use of polyurethanes. 
Metal/plastics composite containing inorganic 
fillers, in which composite an adhesive layer disposed 

between a metal sheet of a thickness from 0.04 to 1 mm 
and a plastics film consisting of polyolefins, 

polyamides, polyesters, polyvinyl chloride, 
polyvinylidene chloride, polyurethanes or 

polycarbonates contains at least 0.1% by weight, 
preferably 0.5 to 6% by weight, based on the total 

weight of the mixture of filler and the non-volatile 
weight of the adhesive layer, of one or more metal  

 
powders, selected from aluminium powder, magnesium 

powder, zinc powder and manganese powder. 
Metal/plastics composite according to claim 1, 
2 or 3, in which the average particle size of the metal 

powder is in the range of 5 to 20 Âµm. 
Process for producing the metal/plastics 
composite according to claim 1 or 4, in which either 

the mixture of thermoplastics and metal powder is 
extruded and the resulting plastics film is laminated 

onto the metal sheet by means of an adhesive layer or 
the mixture of thermoplastics and metal powder is 

coextruded together with an adhesion promoter, the 
metal sheet is heated and the plastics film is 

laminated onto the metal sheet. 
Process for producing the metal/plastics 
composite according to claim 2 or 4, in which a 

thermoplastic is coextruded together with a mixture of 
adhesion promoter and metal powder, the metal sheet is 

heated and the plastics film is laminated onto the 
metal sheet. 
Process for producing the metal/plastics composite 
according to claim 3 or 4, in which the plastics 

film obtained by extrusion is laminated onto the metal 
sheet by means of an adhesive layer, which contains the 

metal powder. 
Use of the metal/plastics composites according 
to claims 1 to 4 for producing packaging containers.
