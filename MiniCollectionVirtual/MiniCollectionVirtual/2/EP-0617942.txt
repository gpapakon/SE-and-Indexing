<ABSTRACT>
A device for lifting and transporting a patient from a bed 
includes a base frame (10) with ground wheels (11) for rolling across 

the ground. 
The frame includes two parallel horizontal rails (15,16) with each rail 

having a 
main fixed center wheel (19) and castor wheels (21,24) at forward and 

rearward ends 
of the rail. A post (25) mounted on the frame can move vertically and 

carries 
a push bar (27). A seat is mounted on the post on a U-shape frame with 

the seat including a base (36) and a back rest portion (37). The base is 
pivotally 

mounted on one leg of the U-shape member and the back rest can pivot 
and slide relative to the other leg of the U-shape. The U-shape 

support is 
mounted on the post so as to swivel about a vertical axis with the 

vertical axis also translating relative to the post to move the center 
of 

gravity of the patient from an initial lifting position to a 
transport position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for lifting and transporting 
bed ridden patients which is operable to move the patient from the lying 
position within the bed to a seated position in which the patient can be 
transported for toileting or transfer to a chair. Many different devices have been proposed for transferring 
patients from the bed situation to a seating position for toileting or transfer 
to a chair and one example is shown in U.S. patent 4,856,123 of 
Henderson. In this device there is provided a base frame on which the 
device can roll across the floor with a single vertical post on which a 
patient support assembly can be raised and lowered. The patient support 
assembly includes a seat back portion and a seat bottom portion which are 
relatively hinged and moveable from a first horizontal position to an 
inclined seating position. The device is somewhat difficult to push and maneuver due to 
the general configuration of the arrangement and due to the relatively large 
size necessary for the base to maintain stability of the patient over the 
base. Presently available on the marketplace are also different 
designs of lifting device but in most cases these comprise effectively a 
crane arrangement with an overhead boom on which is suspended a sling 
of a fabric material. These arrangements are disadvantageous in that the 
patient is effectively suspended and hence feel insecure due to the 
relatively large amount of movement which can occur by pivotal action  
 
about the end of the boom. The use of the sling which is necessary for 
lifting a patient in this way can cause squeezing or compression of the 
patient as the fabric wraps around the patient and the forces are applied to 
the sides of the patient. This can be uncomfortable or painful for arthritic 
patients or patients with damaged bone structures. Furthermore the 
overhead boom and the pivotal action require a very large and widely 
spaced base frame to maintain stability. The large base significantly 
reduces maneuverability and hence the large base is difficult to enter 
limited areas and since it is difficult to rotate the large base due to the 
wide spacing of the wheels. Other devices for transferring a patient from a lying position to 
its seated position comprise effectively collapsible wheelchairs but these 
have achieved little success in the marketplace due to their complexity and 
due to the fact that they require the patient to be rotated on the bed to a 
position transverse to the bed before the device can be moved
