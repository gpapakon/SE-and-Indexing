<ABSTRACT>
A carrier (10) for an electronic identification device which permits the electronic device to be attached to an object to be identified. The electronic device is integrally moulded into the carrier (10). The electronic device is associated with a housing (14) which is moulded into the carrier. The housing (14) can be annular and coaxially located with an opening (12) in a panel (11) whereupon the housing (14) is encapsulated within encasing material (15) during actual moulding of carrier (10). Carrier (10) is preferably a female component of a two piece animal ear tag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carrier for an electronic identification device.The carrier according to the invention provides a means of attaching an
electronic identification device to an object to be identified. The object to be
identified can, for example, be an animal.It is known to provide electronic identification devices which are attachable
to an animal in order to provide electronic identification of the animal. This is
achieved by mounting an electronic identification device with the animal and then
obtaining a signal from the device, this signal being "read" by an interrogator
device. In a known form the electronic identification device can be implanted in
the animal.A second method of attaching the identification device is to use an
externally mountable attachment member or carrier and more particularly an
animal ear tag or component thereof. The identification device is mounted with the
ear tag or tag component in an operation which takes place after manufacture of
the tag or tag component. For example, US patent 4 718 697 discloses a means of
incorporating an electronic device within a cavity formed by fastening together
two panels of a preformed ear tag component. While this arrangement has proved
to be effective the operation of positioning the electronic device and combining the
two tag panels together leads to increased manufacturing operations and
consequently end cost. Also the overall weight and physical dimensions of the tag
can be a relevant factor.EP-A-0 407 853 seeks to provide an animal identification tag
incorporating an electronic identification device, which device will be destroyed if
the tag is removed from the animal. This object is achieved by incorporating the
electronic identification device in the stem portion of the tag so that it extends
beyond positions where the tag will be cut for removal. Thus, when the tag is cut
for removal, the electronic identification device will be destroyed.WO86/00498 seeks to provide an animal identification tag which will be
difficult for the animal to release (by biting or the like) and which is simple to
install on the animal (e.g. no need to make a preliminary hole). The plastics body
of the tag is formed around a circuit wafer 15 carrying elements of the electric
circuitry used in the tag. This circuit wafer 15 may be located in the stem of the
tag or in the head portion thereof. The bobbin used in the antenna is wound on a
ferrite core in the head of the tag. WO92/02127 describes an animal identification device having a first
portion,

<CLAIMS>
A carrier for an electronic identification device, said carrier (10) being
constructed so as to be, in use, engageable with a co-operating component

whereby the carrier and co-operating component can be joined together to
facilitate attachment of the carrier to an object to be identified, said carrier having

located therein said electronic identification device (27), and characterised by a
housing (14) holding said electronic device (27) and a wire (W) forming an

antenna, said housing after receiving said electronic device and wire being

integrally moulded into the plastics material (11, 15) forming the or at least part of
said carrier (10).
A carrier as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing (14) is of
substantially annular shape and has a plurality of outwardly projecting studs (16,

17).
A carrier as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing (14) is a
substantially annular bobbin onto which wire (W) forming the antennae of the

electronic identification device (27) is wound, said electronic identification device
being mounted with a flange (25) of the bobbin (14).
A carrier as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
housing (14) is constructed from a plastics material which bonds with the plastics

material (11, 15) from which the carrier (10) is constructed.
A carrier as claimed in claim 4, wherein the housing material is a
polycarbonate and the carrier material is a polyurethane.
A carrier as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
carrier forms or incorporates the female component of a two piece animal ear tag.
A method of manufacturing a carrier of the type as claimed in claim 1,
said method including the steps of supporting said housing in a moulding tool, moulding a plastics

material about said housing to partially form said carrier, thereafter moulding
plastics material on said partially completed carrier to complete the carrier. 
The method according to claim 7, wherein a part of said housing (14) is
supported in a first die part (31) of a two part injection moulding tool (30) 

whereupon said partial moulding of the carrier is effected, said partially completed
carrier being subsequently located with a moulding cavity (37) for completion of

moulding such that said housing is encased within said plastics material.
The method according to claim 8, wherein said first die part (31) includes a
cavity (33) in which said part of said housing is supportable and said moulding

cavity (37) is included with said first die part, the die parts (31 and 35) being
movable such that a partially completed carrier can be located with said moulding

cavity (37) for completion of moulding.
The method according to claim 9, wherein the first die part (31) is rotatable
relative to the second die part (37) to effect movement of said partially completed

carrier such that it locates with said moulding cavity (37).
The method according to claim 9 or 10, wherein said first die part (31) has
a plurality of said cavities (33) and moulding cavities (37) and said second die part

(35) has an equivalent number of moulding cavities (34) such that those in register
with said cavities (33) facilitate partial moulding of the carrier and those in register

with the moulding cavities (37) of the first die (31) part locates said partially
completed carrier relative thereto for completion of moulding of the carrier.
