<ABSTRACT>
A cerclage fixation component (436) and a screw fixation component (440) are engageable together to form a composite bone fixation device. The cerclage component (436) may be a ladder plate with openings defined between bridges (442). The openings provide sockets for bosses (462) of the screw fixation component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bone fixation
system, and particularly (though not exclusively) to a
system that may be employed in bone implant surgery such as
hip replacement operations, or subsequent surgical
treatment of the bone structure in the region of an
implant. The term 'bone fixation' is intended to cover not
only the connection of bone to bone but also the connection
of components to bone.Cerclage is a known fixation technique in which a bone
is encircled by a flexible member such as a cable which is
drawn tight and clamped. This may serve to hold portions
of bone or bone graft together and/or to retain some
surgically applied component. For an account of current
cable techniques for trochanteric reattachment, femoral
allograft fixation and fractures of the proximal femur in
revision total hip arthroplasty, the reader is referred to
D.M.Dall, Techniques in Orthop. 1991; 6(3):7-16. This
describes, among other things, use of a bone fastener for
the greater trochanter, as disclosed in US-A-4,269,180.
This known bone fastener is a generally H-shaped implant
comprising a base structure including a pair of limbs
joined by a bridge, the bridge being bounded by a front
face, a rear face and edge faces, a plurality of teeth
protruding from the base structure, all the teeth lying on
the same side of the base structure, and at least one hole 
in the base structure for receiving a cable, the hole being
elongate in form, extending lengthways through the bridge,
and being open at each end. The bridge is adapted to be
crimped so that cable(s) can be passed through the hole(s),
pulled tight, and then locked by crimping.Fig. 1 is a drawing, taken from the cited paper,
showing a femur 10 that has undergone reconstructive
surgery including use of a fastener 12 according to US-A-4,269,180.
In this procedure, the greater trochanter 16
was cut (osteotomised) to facilitate installation in the
bone cavity of an internal bone graft 14 and the stem of
a prosthesis (not shown but c.f. stem 71 in Fig. 7).
Thereafter the greater trochanter 16 was reattached to the
femur 10 by means of the fastener 12 and cerclage cables
18. In addition a fracture 20 of the femur was surgically
treated with a further application of cerclage techniques.
Thus elongate medial and lateral bone grafts 22 have been
applied to the bone, and bound in place by a multiplicity
of cerclage cables 24, each of which has been drawn tight
and had its ends locked by crimping in an individual crimp
sleeve 26.FR-A-2 357 229 refers to bone fixation
