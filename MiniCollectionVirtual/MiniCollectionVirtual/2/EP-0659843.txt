<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to non-lustrous pigments of high colour intensity and high hiding power (opacity) which are obtainable by dry-milling platelet-like inorganic substrates, followed by classification and application of one or more layers of which each comprises one or more sparingly soluble, firmly adhering inorganic or organic colorants.

<CLAIMS>
Non-lustrous pigment of high colour intensity
and high hiding power, which pigment is obtainable by

dry-milling of platelet-like inorganic substrates,
followed by classifying and applying one or more layers

each of which contains one or more sparingly soluble,
strongly adhering inorganic or organic colorants.
Pigment according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 classification is carried out to give a d
95
 cut of
less than 50 Âµm.
Pigment according to any one of Claims 1 to 2,

characterized in that
 mica or other sheet silicates are
used as the platelet-like inorganic substrates.
Pigment according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 metal chalcogenides or metal
chalcogenide hydrates, colour lakes, complex salt pigments,

carbon black particles and/or organic dyes are
contained therein as the colorant.
Pigment according to any one of Claims 1-4,

characterized in that
 it contains metal oxides/hydrated
metal oxides, aluminium colour lakes, cyanoferrate

complexes, phthalocyanine or metal phthalocyanine dyes
and/or indanthrene dyes as the colorant.
Pigment according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the metal oxide is titanium dioxide or an iron
oxide.
Pigment according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the colorant is yellow FeO(OH) in the goethite
form. 
Pigment according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the mass proportion of metal oxide/hydrated metal
oxide coating relative to the substrate is from 5 to 350

mass percent.
Pigment according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 it exhibits one or two colorant
layers.
Process for preparing the pigments according to
any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the
colorant layers are precipitated onto the dry-milled and

classified, dispersed substrate particles by a wet
chemical method or are applied by CVD in a fluidized-bed

reactor, and are then washed, dried and, if desired,
calcined.
Use of the pigments according to any of Claims 1
to 9 in printing or paint and coating formulations,

cosmetics and plastics.
