<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a water-soluble graft polymer, 
which includes the steps of: (1) preparing (A) a 

polyether compound including 80 mol % or more of ethylene 
oxide as a constituent unit and having a number-average 

molecular weight of 200 or more and (B) a monomer 
component including (bl) 40 to 100 mol % of (meth)acrylic 

acid and (b2) 0 to 60 mol % of another copolymerizable 
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer; and then (2) 

carrying out graft polymerization of the monomer component 
(B) upon the polyether compound (A) by mixing the monomer 

component (B) with the polyether compound (A) at 100 °C or 
higher in the presence of a polymerization initiator using 

substantially no solvent. In this reaction, the amount 
grafted of the monomer component (B) is approximately 25 

wt. % per 100 wt. % of the polyether compound (A) or 
larger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to graft polymers in 
which monoethylenically unsaturated monomers including a 
major proportion of (meth)acrylic acid are grafted on 
polyethers including a major proportion of ethylene oxide, 
and also the invention relates to a production process of 
the graft polymers. Graft polymerization of (meth)acrylic acid upon 
polyether compounds has so far been attempted in various 
fields of utilization such as polyurethane. For example, 
Japanese Official Patent Provisional Publication No. Showa 
55-71710 discloses graft polymers and their production 
process wherein graft polymerization of 3 to 15 wt. % (based 
on the total charged amount) of acrylic acid upon 
polyoxyalkylene compounds is carried out. However, in this 
case, when the graft polymers obtained are used as builders, 
they do not display satisfactory performance, or a very 
large amount of these polymers need to be added for 
displaying their performance, because the content of 
carboxylic acids in these polymers is too low. In addition, Japanese Official Patent Provisional 
Publication No. Showa 59-62614 discloses graft polymers and 
their production process wherein graft polymerization of at  
 
least 20 wt. % (based on the graft polymers) of 
ethylenically unsaturated hydrophilic monomers upon 
polyglycol ethers having at least one hydrophobic group is 
carried out. However, in this process, a solvent such as 
water and toluene is used, or even if no solvent is used, 
the reaction temperature is 90°C or lower. Therefore, the 
graft efficiency of polymers obtained is low and a large 
amount of polymers having no grafted part are formed. In 
the case where such graft polymers are used as builders or 
dispersants for inorganic pigments and the like, 
satisfactory performance is not displayed. In addition, in 
the case where these graft polymers are used as builders for 
liquid detergents, there occurs a problem that the polymers 
separate. In addition, Japanese Official Patent Provisional 
Publication No. Heisei 3-177406 also discloses the same 
graft polymers as mentioned above, which are obtained by 
carrying out polymerization in a water solvent. However, in 
this polymerization process, the graft efficiency is low and 
most of the polymers obtained are polycarboxylic acids 
having no grafted part. Therefore, in the case of using 
these polymers as builders, there are the same problems as 
the above-mentioned prior arts. As seen above, in the prior arts, graft polymers 
cannot be produced which have a high
