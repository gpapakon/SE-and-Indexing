<ABSTRACT>
A spray dampener for a printing press has a row of spray 
nozzles (5) for spraying liquid on a roller (3). A shutter 

device (14) for mechanically screening off part of or the 
whole spray cone is arranged at a nozzle towards the end of 

the roller. The shutter device is a shield (14), attached 
to a shaft (11) rotatably arranged at the side of the 

nozzle facing the end of the roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spray dampener for a printing
press, comprising in a housing a row of spray nozzles
for spraying a liquid on a roller in the printing press,
the row being substantially parallel with the roller axis,
wherein a shutter device for adjusting the spray width on the
roller by mechanically screening off part
of or a whole spray cone is arranged only at a nozzle towards
the end of the housing.Spray dampeners are commercially available and are
used to spray a fountain solution mixed with water on a
roller in a printing press, preferably an offset press, in
precisely controlled amounts in order i.a. to increase the
printing quality and reduce the ink consumption.It is already known to provide means for controlling
the supply of fountain solution mixed with water to the
nozzles in dependence of certain factors, such as the
operating speed of the printing press. However, if the
paper web to be printed in the printing press has a smaller
width than the roller sprayed by the nozzles of the spray
dampener, the water sprayed on the roller outside the width
corresponding to the paper web width may cause disadvantages.In order to ensure that only a roller width corresponding
to the paper web width is fully dampened by the
spray dampener nozzles, shutter devices of the kind shown
in EP-A -344 409 and US-A-4 831 927 (see Fig 6) may be employed.The main object of the invention is to provide
improved means for screening off a spray cone at a spray
dampener.This is according to the invention attained in that 
the shutter device is a preformed shield, attached to an externally
rotatable shaft, arranged in the housing at the side of the
nozzle facing the end of the housing. Hereby an adjustment
of the spray width may be performed from the outside
without any need for tools.By a device as described the purpose of preventing
dampening liquid to reach the roller outside the paper web
width is obtained. However, for different reasons it may be
preferred to allow a certain amount of liquid to reach the
screened off portion of the roller. This may according to
the invention be obtained in that the shield is provided
with holes, allowing a certain amount of the sprayed liquid
to reach the roller at the screened off portion.The shaft for the shield may be turned either by means
of a handle or a motor so as to adjust the angular position
of the shield in accordance with the desired spray width.The invention will be described in further detail below
under reference to the accompanying drawing, in which
