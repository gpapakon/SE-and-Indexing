<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging tray for deep-frozen food, in particular for ice cream, consisting of a tray (1) and a covering lid (2). To manufacture such a packaging tray whilst avoiding plastic products, it is proposed that both tray and covering lid are each manufactured from an essentially rectangular blank which can be stacked flat and is made of waterproof and/or greaseproof cardboard material. The tray (1) or the covering lid (2) is cut and folded in such a way that a continuous edge (20) is formed, having a single alignment.
