<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses DNA molecules comprising a gene encoding yeast
acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase resistant to soraphen A inhibition. Mutations confering

soraphen A resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase can be dominant or recessive, and they
can be point mutations, deletion or insertion mutations. In addition methods of isolating a

gene encoding fungal acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase resistant to soraphen A inhibition
are provided as well as methods for


purifying fungal acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase resistant to soraphen A inhibition.
Purified enzyme can be used in assays to identify inhibitors of soraphen A resistant

acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to genes encoding an acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase
resistant to soraphen A inhibition, methods of isolating these genes, purified acetyl-coenzyme
A carboxylase resistant to soraphen A inhibition and assays to identify
inhibitors of soraphen A resistant acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase.The 18-membered macrolide soraphen A, is a secondary metabolite of the myxobacterium
Sorangium cellulosum, strain So ce 26. The chemical structure of Soraphen A is shown in
formula (I).
Until now over 60 natural variants of soraphen A could be isolated (Augustiniak et al,
'Chemische Arbeiten', in: 'Wissenschaftlicher Ergebnisbericht', Seiten 36-40, GBF
Braunschweig, 1989). Soraphen A exhibits strong activity as a fungicide, while it is
without effect on bacteria. In one instance it was shown to interfere with acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (Pridzun, 'Untersuchungen zum Wirkungsmechanismus von Soraphen A',
Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig, Germany, doctoral thesis) which is a key enzyme
in fatty acid biosynthesis.The main objective of the present invention is to provide soraphen A resistant genes which
genes are able to confer soraphen A resistance to a host organism comprising said genes. It
has now surprisingly been found that all soraphen A resistant genes so far isolated in
yeast, a model system for fungi, are mutated in a single gene. The gene is identified to be
yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase the DNA sequence of which is known (Al-Feel et al, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4534-4538, 1992). Thus yeast strains resistant to soraphen A
surprisingly result from mutation of a single gene, namely acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The 
mutations show dominant, semidominant, or recessive phenotypes in heterozygous diploid
strains.The mutant genes according to the invention can be used to produce recombinant
soraphen A resistant acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which in turn can be used in invitro assays
to determine the inhibitory effect of soraphen A derivatives or other compounds on the
activity of the mutant acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These assays allow to identify improved
soraphen A derivatives which induce less fungi resistent to soraphen A or compounds
which are useful in anti-resistance strategies.The present invention relates primarily to a DNA molecule comprising a gene encoding
acetyl-CoA carboxylase resistant to soraphen A inhibition, but especially to a molecule
comprising a gene encoding fungal, preferably yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
