<ABSTRACT>
In an operation mechanism of a switch having 
three positions of operation, when a first driving crank (42) 

is rotated and is engaged with a recess (41C) of a driven lever (41) 
at a roller disposed on the crank, revolution of a 

second driving crank (52) is obstructed by a plate member (42G) 
mounted on the first driving crank. In a similar manner, 

when the second driving crank is rotated and is engaged with 
the recess of the drive lever, the revolution of the first 

driving crank is obstructed by a plate member (52G) of the 
second driving crank. Therefore, even if the first 

driving crank or the second driving crank is erroneously 
operated, erroneous operation of the switch is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
operation mechanism for a switch, and particularly to an
operation mechanism for a switch having three positions of
operation of "disconnection", "connection" and "ground",
for example.In an operation mechanism for a switch having
three positions of operation, three positions of rotation
of a rotating shaft are predetermined to operate the
switch, and the three positions of rotation correspond to
"disconnection", "connection" and "ground" of the switch,
for example. In the operation mechanism of the switch
having three positions of operation in the prior art, the
known Geneva mechanism, one of intermittent rotating
apparatus, is incorporated in the above-mentioned rotating
shaft. The Geneva mechanism is composed of a Geneva gear
and a driving crank, and the Geneva gear is intermittently
rotated by a predetermined angle at every revolution of
the driving crank. The above-mentioned rotating shaft is
connected to the Geneva gear, and is rotated by the
predetermined angle at every revolution of the driving 
crank. The three positions of rotation of the rotating
shaft made by three revolutions of the driving crank
correspond to the "disconnection", "connection" and
"ground" of the switch, respectively.In the operation mechanism of the switch having
three positions of operation in the prior art, the Geneva
gear is rotated by one driving crank. Therefore, if a
target position of the three positions is mistaken for
wrong position or if the rotating direction of the driving
crank is mistaken, the switch is incorrectly operated.Another operation mechanism for a switch, which discloses
the pre-characterising features of claim 1, is known from
JP-A-05 054 747.An object of the present invention is to provide
an operation mechanism for a switch having three positions
of operation which is provided with means for preventing
incorrect operation of the switch.The operation mechanism for a switch having
three positions of operation in accordance with the
present invention comprises:
a rotating shaft adapted to be connected to an operation shaft
of the switch having three positions of operation,a driven lever comprised of a plate member
perpendicularly connected to the rotating shaft, having a
recess formed from an end of the plate member toward the
rotating shaft on a center line passing through the
rotating shaft and a first arc-shaped concave and a second
arc-shaped concave which are formed symmetrically with 
respect to the center line on the end portion, a first driving

<CLAIMS>
An operation mechanism for a switch having three
positions of operation, said mechanism comprising:


a rotating shaft (41A) adapted to be connected to an operation shaft
of said switch having three positions of operation,
a driven lever (41) comprised of a plate member
perpendicularly connected to said rotating shaft, having a

recess (41C) formed from an end of said plate member toward said
rotating shaft on a center line (X) passing through said

rotating shaft and a first arc-shaped concave (41D) and a second
arc-shaped concave (41J) which are formed symmetrically with

respect to said center line on the end portion,
a first driving shaft (42A) and a second driving shaft (52A)
pivotally mounted at symmetrical positions with respect to

said center line (X) at a predetermined reference position of
said driven lever (41),
a first driving crank (42) mounted on said first
driving shaft (42A), comprising a roller (42E) for engaging with said

recess (41C) of said driven lever (41) by revolution of said first
driving shaft (42A), and an arc-shaped convex member (42F) for engaging

with said first arc-shaped concave (41D) of said driven lever,
a second driving crank (52) mounted on said second
driving shaft (52A), comprising a roller (52E) for engaging with said

recess (41C) of said driven lever by revolution of said second
driving shaft (52A), 

and an arc-shaped convex member (52F) for
engaging with said second arc-shaped concave (41J) of said

driven lever,

characterised by a semicircular member (42G, 52G) mounted on each of said first (42A) and second (52A)
driving shafts,


first stopper means (36A) for limiting an angle of
clockwise revolution of said first driving crank (42) from said

reference position to a predetermined value, and
second stopper means (39A) for limiting an angle of
counterclockwise revolution of said second driving crank (52)

from said reference position to a predetermined value, and
whereby in the state that said roller (42E) of said
first driving crank is engaged with said recess (41C) of said

driven lever, a semicircular part of said semicircular member (42G)
mounted on said first driving shaft opposes close to a

straight part (52I) of said semicircular member (52G) mounted on said
second driving shaft so as to block rotation of the second driving crank (52), and in the state that said roller of

said second driving crank (52E) is engaged with said recess (41C) of
said driven lever, a semicircular part of said semicircular

member (52G) mounted on said second driving shaft
opposes close to a straight part (42I) of said semicircular member (42G)

mounted on said first driving shaft so as to block rotation of the first driving crank (42).
An operation mechanism for a switch having three
positions of operation in accordance with claim 1, wherein


said driven lever (41) is provided with three
recesses (41E, 41F, 41G) corresponding to three revolution positions,
a frame (43) holding said driven lever is provided
with openings 43E, and 
a stopper rod (60) is inserted through one of said
three recesses and said openings so as to prevent rotation of the driven lever in maintenance work or repair operation.
