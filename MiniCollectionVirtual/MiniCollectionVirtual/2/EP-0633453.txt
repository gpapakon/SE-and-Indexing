<ABSTRACT>
An operating button (29) preferably fitted to the 
control rod (24) for resetting a vehicle trip odometer; 

the rod (24) being movable, against an elastic force, 
through an opening (33) in a display window (16); and 

the button (29) being accessible manually from outside 
the window (16), and presenting elastic tabs (34) which 

are inserted and snapped behind a shoulder (38) of the 
opening (33) in the window (16), and are guided in 

slackfree manner by a cylindrical surface (37) of the 
opening (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operating 
button for the control rod of a measuring instrument 
such as a vehicle trip odometer. Various types of measuring instruments are known 
which require resetting between one measurement and the 
next. In the case of trip odometers with numbered drums, 
a rod is normally provided which is fitted through the 
transparent display window and operated manually for 
resetting the drums. The usual operating button fitted to the control 
rod of known odometers presents several drawbacks, in 
that it must be preassembled to the rod to prevent it 
from being withdrawn; it must be centered in relation to 
the hole in the display window to prevent it from 
jamming when operated; and the connection is noisy, due 
to the clearance between the button and the display 
window. Operating devices are known in which the reset 
device is particularly well made, e.g. provided with  
 
seals or latches, for eliminating some of the above 
drawbacks. Such reset devices, however, are invariably 
very expensive and fail to provide for eliminating all 
the drawbacks involved. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an extremely straightforward operating button 
for the control rod of a measuring instrument, designed 
to overcome the above drawbacks typically associated 
with known operating buttons. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an operating button for the control rod of a 
measuring instrument, for example, a vehicle trip 
odometer, wherein said instrument comprises a display 
window; said rod is movable, against an elastic force, 
through an opening in said window; and said button is 
connected to said rod, and is manually accessible from 
outside said window; characterized by the fact that said 
button is hollow and connected frictionally to a portion 
of said rod; said button being guided by a substantially 
cylindrical surface of said opening. Two preferred, non-limiting embodiments of the 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a part view in perspective of a 
drum type odometer featuring the operating button 
according to the present invention; Figure 2 shows a larger-scale axial section of a 
first embodiment of the operating button according to  
 
the present invention; Figure 3 shows a larger-scale section along line 
II-II in Figure 2; Figure 4 shows a larger-scale section along line 
IV-IV in Figure 2; Figure 5 shows a larger-scale axial section of a

An operating button for the control rod of a 
measuring instrument, for example, a vehicle trip 

odometer, wherein said instrument comprises a display 
window (16); said rod (24) is movable, against an 

elastic force, through an opening (33) in said window 
(16); and said button (29, 42) is connected to said rod 

(24), and is manually accessible from outside said 
window (16); characterized by the fact that said button 

(29, 42) is hollow and connected frictionally to a 
portion (28) of said rod (24); said button (29, 42) 

being guided by a substantially cylindrical surface (37) 
of said opening (33). 
A button as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that retaining means (38, 51) are provided 

for locking and preventing withdrawal of said button 
(29, 42) from said rod (24). 
A button as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that it presents at least two 

elastic tabs (34, 43) by which it is guided by said 
surface (37). 
A button as claimed in Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized by the fact that said retaining means 

comprise a shoulder (38, 51) on said surface (37) and 
which is engaged by said elastic tabs (34, 43). 
A button as claimed in Claim 4, characterized 
by the fact that it is formed in one piece from plastic 

 
material; said button (29, 42) being fitted to said rod 

(24) from outside said window (16) by snapping said tabs 
(34, 43) behind said shoulder (38, 51). 
A button as claimed in Claim 5, characterized 
by the fact that said tabs (34, 43) project from and are 

formed in one piece with the cylindrical body (32) of 
said button (29, 42), are substantially coaxial with 

said body (32), and present a free edge (39, 49) for 
engaging said shoulder (38, 51). 
A button as claimed in Claim 6, characterized 
by the fact that said tabs (34) are connected to said 

body (32) at an annular connecting end, and extend 
axially towards said window (16) from said annular end; 

said shoulder (38) being annular. 
A button as claimed in Claim 6, characterized 
by the fact that said tabs (43) are connected to said 

body (32) by an axial portion (44), and extend 
circumferentially in the form of two lateral portions 

(46) from said axial portion (44); said shoulder (51) 

being engaged by two adjacent edges (49) of said lateral 
portions (46).
