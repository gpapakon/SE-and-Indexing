<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for measuring 
the speed of a vehicle, particularly a motor vehicle, passing 

a measurement position, by transmitting a radiation 
beam to the measurement position, receiving a radiation beam 

reflected by the vehicle passing the measurement position, 
and determining therefrom the speed at which the vehicle 

passes the measurement position, wherein a radiation beam is 
then transmitted to the measurement position only when a 

vehicle is passing this position. The radiation beam can 
herein be generated and transmitted continuously but only be 

directed at the measurement position when a vehicle passes 
this position. 
The invention further relates to a device for performing 
this method, with means for generating and transmitting 

a radiation beam, means for receiving a reflected 
radiation beam, means for determining therefrom the speed at 

which the measurement position was passed, and means for 
interrupting a measurement co-acting with the beam generating 

and transmitting means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for measuring 
the speed of a vehicle, particularly a motor vehicle, passing 
a measurement position, by transmitting a radiation 
beam to the measurement position, receiving a radiation beam 
reflected by the vehicle passing the measurement position, 
and determining therefrom the speed at which the vehicle 
passes the measurement position. Such a method is generally 
known and is regularly used by police at radar traps. Herein a radar installation, for example as made 
commercially available by applicant under the name "Gatso 
Micro Radar", is disposed at a fixed location along a road 
or in a travelling police vehicle. The radar installation 
transmits a wave beam at a fixed angle of for instance 20Â° 
to the road axis or the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, 
and thus defines a measurement area or measurement position 
covered by the wave beam. When a motor vehicle passes 
through the beam a part of the wave beam is thereby reflected 
and received by the installation. From the frequency 
difference between the transmitted and received wave beam 
(as a result of the so-called Doppler effect) the speed can 
be determined at which the vehicle has passed through the 
beam. If this speed exceeds a determined set limit value, a 
camera for instance can be activated or a following police 
stop point can be alerted. The method is applied to both 
passing traffic and oncoming traffic. The known method has the drawback however that 
when a vehicle passes through the transmitted wave beam, the 
latter is reflected not only to the radar installation but 
also in other directions, including the direction of the 
vehicles travelling behind the vehicle passing through the 
beam. When these following vehicles are provided with a so-called 
radar detector, they are hereby warned of the approaching 
radar trap, so that they have the opportunity to 
reduce their speed in good time before the measurement 
position. This frustrates the measurement, since it is 
precisely drivers who are in the habit of exceeding the  
 
maximum speed who will generally possess a radar detector. 
This problem is becoming more acute now that radar detectors 
are on the market which can detect dispersed radar beams 
over a distance of about 500 m. It is otherwise not only 
passing vehicles which cause dispersal of the radar beam but 
also road signs, crash barriers, lamp-posts and the like can 
cause undesired reflection of the beam, whereby approaching 
drivers are warned of a radar trap. The invention

Method for measuring the speed of a vehicle 
(5), particularly a motor vehicle, passing a measurement 

position, by transmitting a radiation beam (4) to the measurement 
position, receiving a radiation beam reflected by the 

vehicle (5) passing the measurement position, and determining 
therefrom the speed at which the vehicle (5) passes the 

measurement position, characterized in that a radiation beam
