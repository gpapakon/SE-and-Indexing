<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a circuit arrangement for the digital multiplying of integer numbers, with a coding unit, and adding unit which adds the output values of the coding unit, and a decoding unit which decodes the output value of the adding unit. The invention is distinguished in that the coding unit codes the numbers by the formula: X = 2
<
k
>
 * (1 + xB) = 2
<
k
>
 + XB, Y = 2
<
1
>
 * (1 + yB) = 2
<
1
>
 + YB, the adding unit adds the quantities K, 1 and x and y and the mixed terms XB*YB are either not formed or a calculated recursively by the present process, depending on the accuracy desired.

A circuit arrangement for digital multiplication of
two integers X, Y, having


an encoding unit,
an adding unit, which adds the output values of the
encoding unit, and
a decoding unit, which decodes the output value of the
adding unit,
characterized by
 said encoding unit encoding the integers
X,Y according to the following formula:


X = 2
k
 * (1 + x
B
 ) = 2
k
 + x
B
Y = 2
1
 * (1 + y
B
) = 2
1
 + y
B

by said adding unit adding the values k,l and x
B
 and y
B
 for
the following multiplication,


X * Y = 2
k
 * (1 + x
B
 ) = 2
1
 * (1 + y
B
 )

= 2
k+1
 * (1 + x
B
 + y
B
 + x
B
y
B
),

by the mixed term x
B
*y
B
 representing a measure for the
accuracy for the calculation so that depending on the

accuracy for the multiplication the following applies:

x
B
 , y
B
 ≈ 0 :

X * Y = 2
k+1
(1 + x
B
 + y
B
)
x
B
 , y
B
 ≈ 1 :

X * Y = 2
k+1+1
(1 + {x
B
 + y
B
}/2)
 
with if greater accuracy is required the factors xB and y
B

being encoded once more according to the above encoding
and the product X * Y being recursively calculated.
A circuit arrangement according to claim 1,
characterized by
 a switch matrix carrying out the
logarithmic encoding.
A circuit arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized by
 a shift register being provided for said
decoding.
