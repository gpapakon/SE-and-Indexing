<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use, as antitussive agents
of certain morphinan derivatives or
pharmacologically acceptable acid-addition salts thereof.
The compounds to be used according to the present invention
have strong antitussive activity, and thus suppress
coughing which accompanies bronchography, bronchoscopy, and
a host of respiratory diseases including colds, acute
bronchities, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia,
lung tuberculosis, silicosis, silicotuberculosis, pulmonary
cancer, upper respiratory inflammations (pharyngitis,
laryngitis, nasal catarrh), asthmatic bronchitis, bronchial
asthma, infantile asthma, (chronic) pulmonary emphysema,
pneumoconiosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary silicosis,
pulmonary suppuration, pleuritis, tonsillitis, coughing
hives and whooping cough.Codeine, dextromethorphan and the like are known as
high-strength antitussive agents acting on the central nervous
system. These drugs are used not only by doctors, but also
as single components in combination cold medicines;
however, they inherently have side effects serious enough
to be clinically problematic, including drug dependence,
respiratory depression, smooth muscle depressomotor effects
(constipation) and psychotomimetic effects. Of particular
seriousness is the overuse of antitussive agents containing
codeine, and the psychotomimetic effects of
dextromethorphan, for which reasons safer centrically
acting high-strength antitussive agents have been desired.The existence of opioid receptors as receptors which
contribute to a variety of pharmacological effects, mainly
analgesic, has been demonstrated, and they are known to be
further classified into three types, µ, δ, and κ. σ-receptors
are also known which exhibit a psychotomimetic 
effect. The antitussive effects of morphine and codeine
which act on the µ-type receptors and dextromethorphan
which acts on the σ-type have long been known, but it has
not been possible to avoid the serious side effects such as
drug dependence, respiratory depression, smooth muscle
depressomotor effects (constipation) and psychotomimetic
effects.Incidentally, agonists with affinity to the κ-receptor,
one of the four types mentioned above, are said
not to exhibit the serious side effects which are
clinically problematic, such as drug dependence,
respiratory depression, smooth muscle depressomotor
effects, etc. experienced with µ-receptor agonists such as
morphine. Furthermore, the psychotomimetic effects
experienced with existing κ-receptor agonists are said to
be
