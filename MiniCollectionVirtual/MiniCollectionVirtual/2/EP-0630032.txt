<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-reducible 
dielectric ceramic composition and, more particularly, to a 
non-reducible dielectric ceramic composition used for monolithic 
ceramic capacitors. Monolithic ceramic capacitors are generally 
produced by first preparing dielectric ceramic green sheets 
with a dielectric ceramic composition such as a composition 
mainly comprising barium titanate, applying a conductive 
material for an internal electrode on one surface of each 
green sheet, stacking the green sheets, bonding them by 
thermocompression, cutting the resultant multilayered body 
into ceramic capacitor green chips, then firing the green 
chips in air at 1250 - 1350 °C to form capacitor chips with 
internal electrodes, and finally forming external electrodes 
connected to the internal electrodes on opposed sides of 
each of the capacitor chips to complete monolithic ceramic 
capacitors. Accordingly, a conductive material for internal 
electrodes is required to meet conditions such that (a) it 
has a melting point higher than a sintering temperature of 
the dielectric ceramics as the internal electrodes are fired  
 
along with the dielectric ceramic material; and that (b) it 
neither oxidize nor react with the dielectric ceramics even 
in an oxidizing atmosphere with a high temperature. To meet such requirements, noble metals such as 
platinum, gold, palladium and their alloys have been used as 
a conductive material for the internal electrodes. Such 
noble metals provide satisfactory characteristics, but for 
all practical purposes they are too expensive to use. That 
is, use of such a noble metal is the greatest factor 
determining the rise in the production cost of monolithic 
ceramic capacitors as the cost of internal electrodes 
occupies from 30 to 70 % of the production cost of 
monolithic ceramic capacitors. Other metals having a high melting point are base 
metals such as Ni, Fe, Co, W and Mo, but they are easily 
oxidized in a oxidizing high temperature atmosphere. Thus, 
if such a base metal is used as a material for internal 
electrodes of monolithic ceramic capacitors, it loses the 
function serving as the internal electrodes when the green 
chips are fired in air. It is therefore required to fire 
the green chips in a neutral or reducing atmosphere in order 
to use a base metal as a material for internal electrodes Of 
monolithic ceramic capacitors. However, the dielectric 
ceramic materials of the prior art are reduced considerably 
and thus semiconductorized when fired in the
