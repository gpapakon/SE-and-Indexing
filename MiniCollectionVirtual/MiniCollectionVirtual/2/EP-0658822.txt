<ABSTRACT>
A duplexing image forming device (10) which selectively directs
printed pages back onto the original paper supply (12), flipped over with respect

to the page's original position and swapping the leading edge for the trailing
edge, for printing on a second side. The formatter (18) in the image forming

device (10) then instructs the printer engine (17) to print the second side of the
page and reverses the order of data supplied to the print engine (17). A paper

diverter (101) is installed at the output of the fuser mechanism (13) in the print
engine (17). The diverter (101) selectively diverts paper from the standard

output path into a vertical gravity reversing slot (104) through three reversing
rollers (102, 103). The paper is fed from the diverter (104) up through the nip

between the singe driven reversing roller (102) and an idler reversing roller
(103). The driven reversing roller (102) pushes the paper up into the vertical

gravity reversing slot (104). As the trailing edge of the paper exits the nip
between the driven reversing roller (102) and the first idler roller (103), the

trailing edge is carried by the driven reversing roller (102) up and over that roller
into the nip between the second idler reversing roller (103) and the driven

reversing roller (102). The driven reversing roller (102) then forces the new
leading edge of the paper through a duplexing channel (105) where a duplex

paper drive mechanism (106-110) directs the paper onto the top of the existing
paper supply tray (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to duplexing printing devices.
More particularly, this invention relates to a simplified duplexing mechanism for
implementation in a standard laser printer configuration, or similar hard copy
output devises, with limited paper path modification.Current duplexing printing devices employ complex paper handling
mechanisms and methods to print a two sided page. These devices usually
utilize an additional tray for temporary storage of pages having printing on a first
side or provide a second paper path to route the first printed side page around
the existing paper supply. Necessarily, these devices have long paper paths
which extend printing time, increase the size of the printer, require complex
designs and large numbers of parts, including employing a separate reversible
motor to change directions of the paper, all of which is expensive.JP-A-02280172 discloses a both-sided image forming device
wherein the one-sidedly printed page is returned to
the top of the stack of new pages. Then sending
the page out again for printing the second side.
JP-A-57072562 discloses page diverting using a set
of three rollers and a gravity reversing slot.What is needed is a simplified design which has a shorter paper
path to reduce printing time, uses a small number of extra parts and reduces the
cost and size of a duplexing printer. It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide a duplexing printer design which has a relatively short paper path.
Another object of this invention is to reduce the number of parts necessary to
produce a duplexing printer. A further object of this invention is to reduce the
cost of manufacturing duplex printers. Still another object of this invention is to
reduce the printing time for duplex printing. Another object of this invention is
to provide a simple paper path which facilitates clearing of paper jam within the
printing mechanism. Other objects will become apparent in the following
disclosure.These objects, and others, are satisfied by a design for a duplexing
image forming device as defined in claim 1
and associated method as
defined in claim 2, which selectively directs printed pages back onto the 
original paper supply, flipped over with respect to the page's original position
and swapping the leading edge for the trailing edge, for printing on a second
side. The formatter in the image forming device then instructs the printer
engine to print the second side of the page and reverses the order of data
supplied to the print engine. For example, if
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus (10) for printing on two
sides of a page of print media which comprises:


a housing (11);
print engine means (13, 17), for affixing an image
representing data to the page of print media, being

positioned within the housing (11);
formatter means (18) for supplying data to the print
engine means (13, 17), the formatter means (18) being

configured to supply a first set of data representing
the first side of the page in a first order and to

supply a second set of data representing the second side
of the page in a second order which is reverse with

respect to the first order;
print media supply means (12, 19), for supplying pages
of print media to the print engine means (13, 17) from a

stack of print media pages having leading edges and
trailing edges, being attached to the housing (11);
printed page output means (15) for directing the page
from the print engine means (13, 17) out of the housing

(11);
diverter means (101) for diverting a page, having an
image on a first side of the page, away from the printed

page output means (15); and
means (102-110) for placing the diverted page back on
the top of the stack of print media pages and

reorienting the page in a flipped over state with
respect to its original position on the stack having the 

original trailing edge of the page now being the leading
edge, wherein the diverted page is fed on the stack in

the same direction as the print media supply means (12,
19) supplies print media to the print engine (13, 17);

wherein the means for placing the diverted page back on
the top of the stack of print media pages and

reorienting the page comprises:

a set of three reversing rollers (102, 103) wherein one
of the three reversing rollers is defined as the main

reversing roller (102) and a second of the three rollers
(102, 103), together with the main reversing roller (102),

define a first pair of reversing rollers (102, 103) for
receiving the original leading edge of the page

therebetween;
a gravity reversing slot (104) for receiving the page
from the first pair of reversing rollers (102, 103) and

holding it in a generally vertical position;
the set of three rollers (102, 103) further defining a
second pair of reversing rollers (102, 103) by a third

of the three rollers (102, 103) together the main reversing
roller (102), for receiving the original trailing edge

therebetween after the page is fully engaged in the
gravity reversing slot (104); and
a duplexing channel (105) for receiving the page from
the second pair of reversing rollers (102, 103) and

directing the page back on the top of the stack of print
media pages.
A method of printing on both sides of a page using an
image forming device (10) having a print engine (13,

17), a formatter (18) for supplying data to the print
engine (13, 17) representing images to be printed on

both sides of the page, page output means (15) and a 
page supply means (12, 19) including a stack of print

media having leading edges and trailing edges,
comprising the steps of:


first, sending a first set of data to the print engine
(13, 17) in a first order;
then, affixing an image represented by the first set of
data to a first side of the page;
then, diverting the page away from the page output
means;
then, exchanging the leading edge of the page for the
trailing edge of the page;
said diverting and exchanging steps comprising
letting the page pass a set of three reversing

rollers, a gravity reversing slot and a duplexing
channel;
then, placing the page back on the top of the stack of
print media, but in a flipped over orientation with

respect to its original position, wherein the page is
fed on the stack in the same direction as the print

media supply means (12, 19) supplies print media to the
print engine (13, 17);
sending a second set of data to the print engine (13,
17) in a second order which is reverse with respect to

the first order;
then, affixing an image represented by the second set of
data to a second side of the page; and
outputting the page.
