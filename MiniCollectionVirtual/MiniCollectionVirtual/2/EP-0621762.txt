<ABSTRACT>
A bipolar electrosurgical apparatus (10) is provided which is suitable for laparoscopic applications. The apparatus (10) comprises an active electrode (18) and a current return electrode shoe (34). A spring (44) or other resilient member urges the shoe (34) into tissue contact when the active electrode (18) is positioned for surgery. The apparatus (10) is capable of functioning in a cut and a coagulation mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIPOLAR ELECTROSURGICAL INSTRUMENTFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to electrosurgical instruments and, in particular, to a bipolar electro- surgical cutting/coagulating instrument particularly adaptable for use in constricted areas.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Electrosurgery involves the use of an RF signal to produce electrosurgical effects, e.g., to cut and/or coagulate tissue. In conventional monopolar electroÂ¬ surgery, an active electrode is contacted or positioned in close proximity to the tissue to be treated and a current return means (i.e. a pad) is positioned in contact with the patient to complete the circuit. Near the tip of the active electrode, the current is concentrated through a small area of tissue to provide a current density sufficient for cutting or coagulation. The current return means maintains a relatively large area of tissue contact to avoid tissue damage. If the contact surface of the current return means is too small, the current density may result in tissue damage.In recent years, bipolar instruments have been used in certain electrosurgical applications. Bipolar instruments include a pair of closely spaced electrodes of opposite polarity, thereby eliminating the need for a remotely located current return means. It is an advantage of bipolar electrosurgical instruments that current flow 

 is substantially restricted to a small area between the electrodes. Bipolar instruments thereby reduce the likelihood of current damage due to high local current densities or current flow through highly sensitive tissues. Thus, bipolar instruments are advantageously employed in applications such as neurosurgery where the adjacent tissue may be particularly susceptible to damage. Further ease-of-use advantages can be readily appreciated since bipolar instruments do not entail interconnection of a remotely located current return means.Despite these advantages, bipolar instruments have suffered certain limitations. For example, certain bipolar instruments are not unitary, i.e., the electrodes are mounted on separate support structures. Surgeons using such instruments commonly operate one electrode with each hand. Such instruments, therefore, have the disadvantage that the surgeon may be left without a free hand during surgery. In addition, the use of two separate support structures may crowd the surgical site and limit the surgeon's view. Such instruments are also difficult to use in constricted areas and may therefore necessitate larger incisions.Another limitation of
