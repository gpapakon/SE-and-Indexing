<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/857,050, 
filed March 25, 1992. This invention relates to titanyl arsenate crystal 
analogs of potassium titanyl phosphate and their 
preparation using flux growth procedures, and more 
particularly to the use of selected dopants to provide 
improved crystals. Crystals of KTiOPO₄ and its analogs are considered 
highly useful because of their nonlinear optical 
properties. U.S. Patent No. 3,949,323 teaches the use 
of flaw-free crystals in nonlinear optical and electro-optical 
applications. Of the KTiOPO₄ family of 
materials arsenate analogs (e.g., KTiOAsO₄) have been 
recognized as having larger electro-optic coefficients, 
larger nonlinear susceptibility and/or broader 
transparency in the infrared than KTiOPO₄; and thus can 
provide an improved alternative for KTiOPO₄ in many 
applications, see, for examples, Ballman et al., Appl. 
Phys. Lett 54 (9), 783-785 (1989) and Cheng et al., J. 
of Crystal Growth, 110, 697-703 (1991). Since KTiOPO₄ and its isomorphs are known to 
decompose upon melting, hydrothermal and flux methods 
have commonly been used to grow crystals of these 
compounds. U.S. Patent No. 4,305,778, as well as others 
teach preparation of the crystals by hydrothermal 
methods. A desire for larger crystal size, better quality 
and greater durability, as well as the technical  
 
complexity of hydrothermal processes have led to 
continued interest in flux growth techniques and to the 
development of a variety of flux processes. In U.S. 
Patent No. 4,231,838 crystal growth is carried out by 
heating certain mixtures of MTiOXO₄ with a nonaqueous 
flux M/X/O (where M is selected from K, Tl, and Rb and X 
is selected from P and As) or their precursors to 
produce a nonaqueous melt. Crystal growth is affected 
by the use of a temperature gradient or by slow cooling 
of the melt at a rate of not greater than 5°C/hour. Some flux growth methods have included the use of 
other fluxes to improve various aspects of crystal 
production. The use of tungstic anhydride flux is 
described by Ballman, et al., "Growth of Potassium 
Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) from Molten Tungstate Melts" 
J. of Crystal Growth 75, 390-394 (1986) to improve the 
yield of quality crystals. The use of tungstate and 
molybdate fluxes for crystal growth is described in 
Cheng et al.,"Crystal Growth of KTiOPO₄ isomorphs from 
tungstate and molybdate fluxes" J. of Crystal Growth 
110, 697-703 (1991). An improved flux process for
