<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for impregnating, in particular completely impregnating, porous bodies using a curable liquid, in particular methyl methacrylate, wherein after impregnation and prior to polymerisation there is applied to the surface of the body a glutin glue which is removed after curing of the impregnation liquid.

<CLAIMS>
A process for impregnating, in particular 
completely impregnating porous bodies with a hardenable 

liquid, in particular methyl methacrylate, characterized 
in that after the impregnation and before the 

polymerization a glutine glue is applied to the surface 
of the body which is removed following the hardening of 

the impregnating liquid. 
A process according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the glutine glue is brought into a 

sprayable form and is splashed or sprayed on. 
A process according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that for the preparation of a sprayable 

consistence 1 part glutine glue granulate is dissolved in 
3 to 4 parts water. 
A process according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that for complete dissolution the 

glutine glue granulate is stirred for approximately 
1 hour in water at a temperature of about 50Â°C.
