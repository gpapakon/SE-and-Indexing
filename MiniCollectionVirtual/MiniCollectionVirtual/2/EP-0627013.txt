A process for removal of the impurity elements 
arsenic and optionally antimony, iron or bismuth from 

solutions of valuable metals by solvent extraction and 
separation of the impurity elements from one another, in 

which 

a) organic solutions of hydroxamic acids corresponding 
to general formula (I): 


 
in which R is an alkyl and/or alkenyl radical containing 

6 to 22 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl 
radical or an aryl radical containing 

up to 19 carbon atoms,
 
are added to the agueous, strongly mineral acid 

valuable-metal solutions, 
b) the aqueous phase and the organic phase are mixed 
together over an adequate residence time and the 

phases are separated,
 
characterized in that 
c) where antimony, iron or bismuth are present, they 
are subsequently stripped from the organic phase 

with aqueous acids which complex antimony, iron or 
bismuth and, at the same time or thereafter, 
d) arsenic is stripped from the organic phase with an 
aqueous solution containing valuable-metal ions at 

a higher pH value relative to a) in the range from 
1.5 to 5 and 
e) the aqueous solution containing impurity solutions 
are worked up by methods known per se.
