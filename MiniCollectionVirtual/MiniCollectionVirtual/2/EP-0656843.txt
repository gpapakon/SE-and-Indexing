<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
preventing car theft. A variety of devices for preventing car theft have 
been developed and also used. Door locks, electronic alarms 
and steering wheel and gear shift locks are examples of such 
devices. Some of these devices are expensive to buy and 
install while others are unreliable and/or easy to force. The prior art document EP-A 0 242 012 discloses a 
vehicle anti-theft device to prevent unauthorized use of the 
vehicle by preventing access to the vehicle operating 
pedals. The device includes a pivoted covering plate which 
pivots between an inoperative and operative position about a 
hinge. The plate is held in the operative position by a stay 
which is locked in position by a lock at its rear end and 
connected to the plate by a hinge at its front end. The stay 
extends backwards in the driver's area in both inoperative 
and operative position which is a problem to the driver. The prior art document US-A-4,632,209 discloses a 
vehicle anti-theft device of the same type as in EP-A-0 242 
012, but with its stay supporting the plate at only one of 
its vertical edges and locked in a vertical position to the 
gear shift console. The prior art document GB-A-1 380 042 discloses a 
vehicle anti-theft device with its plate also only supported 
at but one of its vertical edges. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a non-expensive and easy-to-mount device of the above 
described kind, which is comparatively difficult to force 
and which is located in the car in such a way as to be 
immediately visible from the outside so as to deter a presumptive 
car thief.  
 A further object of the present invention is to 
overcome the disadvantages known through prior art. These objects are achieved by the device according 
to the invention presenting the features stated in the characterizing 
portions of the claims. Figure 1 is a view of a device according to the 
invention installed in a car, and Figure 2 is a view of the device in Figure 1 seen 
obliquely from the other direction. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing in dashed 
lines from the rear the lower front section 1 of the 
driver's space in a car, which at the bottom is delimited by 
the car floor 2. The foot pedals 3, 4 and 5 of the car are 
disposed at the very front of section 1. The device according to the invention prevents 
access to the pedals 3 - 5, or at least makes access to  
 
these more difficult, and as its most important part 
includes a screen 6, the shape and size of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for preventing car theft, comprising a 
screen (6) disposed between the front seat and foot pedals 

(3 - 5) of the car, which screen is lockable in a generally 
vertical position adjacent to the pedals in order to prevent 

access to these, and which is pivotally mounted to an 
attachment means (8) fixed to the car floor (2) for pivoting 

between the generally vertical position and a position 
abutting against the floor, and an arm (10) which 

is provided with an element (13) which interacts with the screen, 

characterized
 in that said arm (10) 
extends between the said attachment means (8) and the 

screen (6), which arm is located between the latter and the 

pedals (3 - 5) 
and is lockable to the screen by 

means of at least one lock (18). 
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in 
that one end of the arm (10) is pivotally mounted to the 

attachment means (8) and the other end of the arm is pivotally 
mounted to said element (13), which slidably interacts 

with the screen (6). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the lock (18) is mounted to the screen (6) and is 

provided with a lock means (18a) acted on by means of a key, 
which lock means (18a) prevents displacement of said element 

(13) relatively to the screen and therefore pivoting of the 
screen from the generally vertical position. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that said element consists of a plate (13) 
extending essentially along the entire horizontal length of 

the screen (6) and the displacement of which relatively to 
the screen is controlled by guide means (14) disposed at the 

ends of the element and/or the screen, and that the plate is 
prevented from being displaced from the position in which it 

abuts against the floor (2) beyond its generally vertical  
 

position by stop means (15, 16) mounted to the plate and/or 
the screen. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the attachment means (8) is located 
between the pedals (3 - 5) and the screen (6).
