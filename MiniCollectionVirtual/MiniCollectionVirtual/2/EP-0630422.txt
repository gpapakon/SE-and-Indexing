<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for producing thin 
films of high temperature superconducting oxides and 
other materials. This work was preformed in part under funding from 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The United States 
Federal Government may have license rights to the 
invention claimed herein. Thin-films have been prepared by a number of 
deposition methods including evaporation, sputtering, 
laser ablation, and metallo-organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD), see, for example, "Thin Film 
Processes II", (J. L. Vossen and W. Kern, eds.), Academic 
Press, New York, 1991; Handbook of Thin Film Technology", 
(L. I. Maissel and R. Glang, eds.) McGraw Hill, New York, 
1970, and R. W. Simon, Solid State Technology, p. 141, 
September, 1989. The thin film deposition processes of the prior art 
typically depend on the substrate temperature. When the 
temperature of the substrate onto which the thin film of 
YBa₂Cu₃O7-x is being deposited is low, the resulting film 
is amorphous and insulating. A high-temperature post-deposition 
anneal at 800-900°C in oxygen is required to 
convert the amorphous precursor film into a 
superconducting film with the correct crystal structure. 
This two-step process is referred to as a "post-anneal" 
process. However, when a thin-film such as YBa₂Cu₃O7-x is 
deposited onto a substrate heated to about 550-750°C, the 
resulting thin-film is crystalline and superconducting as  
 
deposited. This process is referred to as an "in-situ" 
process. Films produced by an in-situ process have less 
surface roughness and generally superior properties when 
compared to films from a post anneal process. In-situ 
deposition has the added advantage of lower processing 
temperature requirements which makes in-situ deposition 
compatible with a wider variety of substrate materials. In-situ processes require heating the substrate 
uniformly and reproducibly to the required deposition 
temperature. These methods involve direct thermal and 
mechanical anchoring of the substrates to a heated block 
as discussed in R. W. Simon, SPIE Proceedings Vol. 1187, 
p. 2, edited by T. Venkatesan, published by SPIE 
Bellingham, WA (1989). The heated block is made of a 
material that is compatible with an oxygen atmosphere and 
has good thermal conductivity such as nickel. Good 
thermal contact between the substrate and the block is 
usually provided by a compound with high thermal 
conductivity such as silver paste. European Patent Application 285,999 published 
October 12, 1988 discloses a method of
