Container cleaning machine with a revolving conveyor 
chain (5), characterised by an inspection device (19) 

arranged on the conveyor chain (5). 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the inspection device (19) comprises at least one 

camera (15, 16) and/or a sensor (17) each with a 
corresponding display device. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the inspection device (19) comprises at least one 

camera (15, 16), especially a videocamera, and/or a 
sensor (17) each with a corresponding data store 

arranged on the camera or cameras (15, 16) or the 
sensor (17). 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that measuring points (18) 

detectable by the sensor (17) or the camera (15, 16) 
are fitted in the interior (9) of the container 

cleaning machine. 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a controllable device 

for the removal of simple defects and/or cleaning the 
machine is associated with the inspection device (19). 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one support 

(14) is arranged on the conveyor chain (5) and 
constructed for receiving the inspection device (19), 

the support (14) being preferably connected in 
exchangeable manner to the conveyor chain (5).  

 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the container cleaning 

machine has an intake station (1) and a discharge 
station (40) with a disconnectable container infeed 

and discharge mechanism for the introduction and 
removal of the containers. 
Machine according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the disconnection and subsequent connection of the 

container infeed and discharge mechanism when the 
inspection device (19) is passing takes place 

automatically. 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a means of illumination 

is associated with the inspection device (19), 
especially a camera (15, 16), or integrated in the 

latter. 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a transportable energy 

supply is associated with the inspection device (19), 
especially a camera (15, 16), or integrated in the 

latter. 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inspection device 

(19), especially camera (15, 16) and/or sensor (17), 
is connected to a display device, for example a 

monitor, and the data transmission preferably takes 
place in wireless manner, especially continuously. 
Machine according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inspection device 

(19) comprises video cameras (15, 16).
