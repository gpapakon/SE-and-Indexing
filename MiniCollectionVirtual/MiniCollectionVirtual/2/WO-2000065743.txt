<DESCRIPTION>
 EFFECTUATING POWER CONTROL TO MAINTAIN DESIRED QOS LEVELSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to performance of a communication service at a desired QoS (quality of service) level in a cellular, or other radio, communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to apparatus, and an associated method, to effectuate power control in the radio communication system to ensure the performance of the communication service at the desired QoS level. Appropriate gain levels by which to amplify signals to be transmitted to effectuate the communication system at the desired QoS level are determined and requested pursuant to service request negotiations in the form of an offered gain request by a transmitting station.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA communication system permits the communication of information between two or more communication stations. The communication stations are connected by a communication channel upon which a communication signal is transmitted. The communication signal includes the information which is to be communicated between the communication stations. In a two-way communication system, a communication station includes both a transmitter portion and a receiver portion operable to transmit and to receive, respectively, communication signals.A radio communication system is a communication system in which the communication channel formed between the communication 

stations is a radio channel defined upon a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. When a communication station operable in such a communication system includes both a transmitter portion and a receiver portion, the communication station forms a radio transceiver, capable of two-way, radio communication with another communication station. Because communication signals can be transmitted between radio transceivers on radio channels, wire line connections are not required to effectuate communications in a radio communication system. Thereby, communications are possible by way of a radio communication system when formation of a wire line connection between the communication stations would be impractical.A cellular communication system is an exemplary radio communication system. Cellular communication systems, constructed according to various standards, have been installed throughout significant portions of the world. A subscriber to a cellular communication system is able to communicate telephonically by way of a radio transceiver, typically referred to as a mobile station, when the mobile
