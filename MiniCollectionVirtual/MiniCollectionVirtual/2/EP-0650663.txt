<ABSTRACT>
A grass trimming device includes a cutter head (1), a grass 
cutter member (3) supported by the cutter head and mounted for 

rotation in a cutting plane, a source (4) of pressure air, a power 
source (5), a drive line drivingly connecting the power source and 

the cutter member, a grass collection passage (6) for conveying 
cut grass from a mouth (7) disposed at an upstream end of the 

passage and an air outlet opening into the collection passage 
at an upstream position for directing pressure air in a 

downstream direction in the passage. The cutter member 
rotates in the mouth of the collection passage with part of 

the arc of rotation extending outwardly from the mouth and, 
in operation, grass cut by the cutter member is drawn through 

the mouth and transported in a flow of pressure air downstream 
through the collection passage for collection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hand-held grass trimming 
machines of the type in which a cutting member in the form of 
for example, a cutting disc, a blade or blades, or a cord is 
rotatable in a cutting plane, for example a horizontal plane, 
at high angular speeds to cut grass and other vegetation. 
Hand-held trimming machines of this kind are particularly 
useful for cutting long grass which may grow around obstacles 
on a lawn, such as trees, and cannot be cut using a lawn 
mower. When the rotating cutting member in the form of a cord 
or hinged blade(s) passes through light vegetation, the 
vegetation is trimmed, but when such a cutting member and 
especially a cord comes into contact with a more solid 
obstacle, such as a tree, the cord or blade is sufficiently 
flexible not to cause undue damage to the tree or to the 
trimming machine. Various improvements have been made to such trimming 
machines. For example, in one machine it is possible to 
rotate the trimmer head to change the cutting plane so that 
the cutting member can be positioned to rotate not only in 
a conventional horizontal plane but also in a vertical plane 
for trimming the edge of a lawn. In this type of machine the 
head may be supported on a roller to stabilise the trimmer 
head during an edging operation. An example of a trimmer with 
a rotatable head is disclosed in our U.S. Patent number 
4,894,914. Conventional trimmers of this kind have a major  
 
disadvantage in that the grass cuttings are left lying on the 
ground. If the cuttings are left, they are unsightly, 
particularly if left in the middle of an otherwise tidy lawn. 
If the grass cuttings are to be collected, this is usually 
accomplished manually by raking thereby requiring more time 
and effort to be expended. It is an object of the present ivnention to overcome, or 
at least reduce, the above disadvantage of a conventional 
trimmer. A hand-held grass trimming device according to the 
present invention includes a cutter head, a grass cutter 
member supported by the cutter head and mounted for rotation 
in a cutting plane, a power source, a drive line drivingly 
connecting the power source and the cutter member, 
characterised by a source of pressure air, by a grass 
collection passage for conveying cut grass from a mouth 
disposed at an upstream end of the passage and by an air 
outlet for directing a flow of pressure air in a downstream 
direction in the passage whereby, in operation, grass cut by 
the cutter member is drawn through the mouth and transported 
in

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held grass trimming device including a cutter 
head, a grass cutter member supported by the cutter head and 

mounted for rotation in a cutting plane, a power source, a 
drive line drivingly connecting the power source and the 

cutter member, characterised by a source of pressure air, by 
a grass collection passage for conveying cut grass from a 

mouth disposed at an upstream end of the passage and by an air 
outlet for directing a flow of pressure air in a downstream 

direction in the passage whereby in operation, grass cut by 
the cutter member is drawn through the mouth and transported 

in the flow of pressure air downstream through the collection 
passage for collection. 
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
cutter member is rotatable in the region of the mouth of the 

collection passage and with part of an arc of rotation 
ascribed by the cutter member extending outwardly from the 

mouth. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the source 
of pressure air is an impeller drivingly connected to the 

power source. 
A device according to any preceding claim, including a 
grass collector, means for detachably connecting and 

disconnecting the grass collector from the device, and means 
for leading cut grass from the collection passage into the 

 
grass collector. 
A device according to any preceding claim, including 
means for separating the cut grass from the flow of pressure 

air. 
A device according to any one of claims 3, 4 or 5, 
wherein the impeller is disposed on that side of the power 

source remote from the cutter member. 
A device according to any one of claims 3, 4 or 5, 
wherein the impeller is disposed between the power source and 

the cutter member. 
A device according to claim 5, 6 or 7, including means 
for redirecting the flow of pressure air exhausted by the 

means for separating cut grass to the impeller. 
A device according to any of claims 3 - 8, wherein 
ambient air is directed by the impeller to cool the power 

source prior to entry into the collection passage via the air 
outlet. 
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the 
cutter member is a cutter disc, at least one blade, or a cord. 
A device according to any preceding claim, including 
first access means permitting ambient air to be drawn over the 

 
power source to cool the power source. 
A device according to any of claims 3 - 11, including 
second access means permitting ambient air drawn into the 

device by the impeller to by-pass the power source.
