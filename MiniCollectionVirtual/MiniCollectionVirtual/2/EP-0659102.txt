<ABSTRACT>
A method of completely decomposing gasesous halocarbons at temperatures of between about 500  C and about 700  C, preferably about 600  C. The gaseous halocarbons may initially pass through a vaporizer tube (14), before entering the reaction tube (13). The reaction and vaporizer tubes are heated by ceramic fiber heaters (15 and 16). Temperatures were monitored and controlled by a thermocouple inserted into the heaters. Gas flows are monitored with two flowmeters. This sytem for decomposing gaseous halocarbons has the advantage of mixing the halocarbon gas with oxygen and maintaining the temperature at 600  C for a length of time sufficient to eliminate all halocarbons from the gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF DECOMPOSING GASEOUS HALOCARBONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention:The present invention relates generally to methods of decomposing gaseous halocarbons, and more particularly to a method of completely decomposing halocarbons in a gas stream at temperatures of about 600°C. Description of the Prior Art:A variety of halocarbon gases are produced during common commercial processes. In the prior art, it is known to combust these waste gases at temperatures on the order of 1200°C and higher in order to thermally decompose the gases to more environmentally benign products. Unfortunately, the high temperature required for these prior art processes reduces the commercial applicability of prior art methods and precludes their employment in many commercial applications.Recently, a variety of factors have increased the desirability of removing all halocarbons from an exhaust gas stream. In some circumstances the cost of producing halocarbon emissions has increased, while in other circumstances such emissions are prohibited altogether. A need has therefore remained for a method of decomposing gaseous halocarbons in an exhaust gas stream so that no halocarbons remain in the stream. The present invention addresses this need. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONBriefly describing the present invention, there is provided a method of completely decomposing gaseous halocarbons at temperatures of about 600°C. In one aspect of the present invention, a halocarbon gas is mixed with oxygen and heated to 600°C to eliminate all halocarbon from the gas. In a preferred embodiment, CF. and oxygen are mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio and are heated to 600°C to eliminate all fluorocarbon from the gas. In another embodiment, CC1. is completely removed from a gas by mixing the gas with oxygen at a 1:7 molar ratio and heating the mixture to 600°C.One object of the present invention is to provide a method of decomposing gaseous halocarbons at temperatures of about 600°C to completely eliminate all halocarbon from the gas- Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of one apparatus used to test the method of the present invention according to one preferred embodiment.FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a second apparatus used to test the method of the present invention according to one preferred embodiment.

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A method of eliminating gaseous halocarbons from a gas containing such compounds, comprising (a) providing a mixture of air and of the gas containing one or more gaseous halocarbons, the mixture including oxygen in an amount effective to thermally decompose all of the halocarbons in the mixture when the mixture is maintained at a temperature of between about 500°C and about 700°C; (b) heating the gas and oxygen to a temperature of between about 500°C and about 700°C; and
(c) maintaining the mixture of gas and oxygen at about 500°C to about 700°C for a time sufficient to provide elimination of the halocarbons.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the mixture of oxygen and gas containing halocarbon includes an amount of oxygen effective to eliminate all halocarbons from the gas when the gas and oxygen mixture are maintained at a temperature of about 600°C, and wherein each of said heating and said maintaining is at a temperature of about 600°C.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the molar ratio of oxygen to halocarbon is between about 1.5:1 and about 10:1.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said maintaining is for a time of between about 5 seconds and about 90 seconds.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein said gas consists essentially of fluorocarbons.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the molar ratio of oxygen to halocarbon is at least about 2:1. 


 7. The method of claim 6 wherein said maintaining is for a time of at least about 30 seconds.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein said gas consists essentially of chlorocarbons.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the molar ratio of oxygen to halocarbon is at least about 7:1.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said maintaining is for a time of at least about 60 seconds.

1. A method of eliminating gaseous halocarbons from a gas containing such compounds, consisting essentially of (a) providing a mixture of air and of the gas containing one or more gaseous halocarbons, the mixture including oxygen in an amount effective to thermally decompose all of the halocarbons in the mixture when the mixture is maintained at a temperature of between 500°C and 700°C;
(b) heating the gas and oxygen to a temperature of between 500°C and 700°C; and
(c) maintaining the mixture of gas and oxygen at 500°C to 700°C for a time sufficient to provide elimination of the halocarbons.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the mixture of oxygen and gas containing halocarbon includes an amount of oxygen effective to eliminate all halocarbons from the gas when the gas and oxygen mixture are maintained at a temperature of about 600°C, and wherein each of said heating and said maintaining is at a temperature of about 600°C.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the molar ratio of oxygen to halocarbon is between about 1.5:1 and about 10:1.
