<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head drive device includes a pair of 
auxiliary coils (L₁,L₂), a pair 

of switch elements ((S₁,S₂) respectively 
connected in series with the pair of auxiliary coils, 

and a magnetic head. The magnetic head (L₄) is arranged 
between node of the pair of auxiliary 

coils (L₁,L₂) and the 
pair of switch elements (S₁,S₂). 

The switch elements (S₁,S₂) are 
driven by control of a switch element drive device (10) such 

that at least one of the pair of switch elements (S₁,S₂) is 
maintained in an ON state for a predetermined period 

time upon completion or interruption of information 
recording by the magnetic head. A current control 

device is further provided so as to gradually decrease 
a current to be supplied to the pair of 

auxiliary coils (L₁,L₂) 
during the ON state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic head
drive device for modulating the magnetic field of a
magnetic head in accordance with an information signal
to be recorded, and a magnetic recording apparatus for
recording information on a recording medium using the
magnetic head drive device.As a recording method of a conventional
magnetooptical recording apparatus, an optical
modulation method, a magnetic field modulation method,
and the like are known. In particular, the magnetic
field modulation method which can directly overwrite
new data on old data is advantageous in terms of the
recording speed, and the like. Fig. 1 is a schematic
view showing the arrangement of a magnetooptical
recording apparatus adopting the magnetic field
modulation method. Referring to Fig. 1, a
magnetooptical disk 1 as an information recording
medium has a magnetooptical recording layer 1a, and is
rotated by a motor 5. A magnetic head 2 which has an
excitation coil Lh wound around a magnetic core is
arranged above the upper surface of the magnetooptical 
disk 1, and an optical head 4 is arranged below the
lower surface of the disk 1 to oppose the magnetic head
2.When an information signal is recorded, a current
is supplied from a laser drive circuit 7 to a
semiconductor laser 6 arranged inside the optical head
4 as a light source, and a high-power laser beam is
irradiated as a very small beam spot onto the recording
layer 1a of the rotating magnetooptical disk 1, thereby
raising the temperature of the recording portion to a
temperature equal to or higher than the Curie
temperature of the recording layer. On the other hand,
the magnetic head 2 is driven by a drive device 3 to
generate a bias magnetic field which is modulated in
correspondence with information to be recorded, and
applies the generated magnetic field to the temperature
raised portion of the recording layer 1a. Then, the
direction of magnetization of the temperature raised
portion on the recording layer 1a aligns in the
direction of the bias magnetic field, and an
information mark is recorded on the recording layer 1a.
When the recorded information signal is reproduced, the
laser drive circuit 7 supplies a current smaller than
that in the recording mode to the semiconductor laser
6, and a low-power laser beam is irradiated as a very
small beam spot onto the recording layer 1a. Then, a 
sensor detects rotation of the plane of polarization of
reflected light due to the recorded magnetization.Recently, in order to record information at higher
density, the recording
