<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a closable extrusion nozzle for thermoplastic materials, with a nozzle plate (4) containing nozzles permitting the extrusion of the thermoplastic material from a hopper (1) and with a perforated plate (7), disposed upstream of the nozzle plate, whose apertures (8) can be brought in and out of alignment with the nozzles by displacing the perforated plate (7) with respect to the nozzle plate (4). The nozzle plate (4), which is U-shaped in cross-section, with the arms of the U at right angles to the direction of displacement of the perforated plate, is designed as a housing for the perforated plate (7) enclosed within it. A sealing surface (15) on the perforated plate (7) rests against the flat housing floor (5) in which the nozzles (6) are located, there being a gap between the perforated plate (7) and the housing at least in the curved regions (16, 17) of the floor, and the region in which the seal is formed by the sealing surface (15) resting against the floor (5) being limited to a narrow zone round the nozzles (6).

A closable extrusion nozzle for thermoplastic materials with a nozzle
plate (4) containing nozzles (6) that permit extrusion of the plastic

material from a hopper (1), and with a perforated plate (7) arranged
upstream of the nozzle plate (4), whose apertures (8) can be brought

in and out of alignment with the nozzles (6) by displacing the perforated
plate (7) relative to the nozzle plate (4), 
characterized by
 the
nozzle plate (4) that is designed as a housing (5,10,11) with a U-shaped

cross section perpendicular to the sliding direction of the enclosed
perforated plate (7) that rests with a sealing surface (15) against

the flat bottom (5) of the housing (5,10,11) in which the nozzles (6)
are located, wherein a gap (18) is provided between the perforated

plate (7) and the housing (5,10,11) at least in the curved areas (16,17),
and wherein the sealing surface (15) that faces the bottom (5) is

restricted to a narrow area around the nozzles (6).
An extrusion nozzle under claim 1, 
characterized by
 the sealing
surface (15) of the perforated plate (7) having perpendicularly to its

sliding direction a slightly convex shape, to which the bottom (5) of
the housing (5,10,11) adjusts under load.
An extrusion nozzle under claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 the housing
(5,10,11) with flanges that project from the walls (10,11) and that are

bolted to a flat base plate (2) with a perforated plate (7) that is fitted
between the base plate (2) and the bottom (5) of the housing (5,10,11)

such that the contact of the bottom (5) with the sealing surfaces (15)
of the perforated plate (7) is elastic and ensures that the perforated

plate (7) can slide.
