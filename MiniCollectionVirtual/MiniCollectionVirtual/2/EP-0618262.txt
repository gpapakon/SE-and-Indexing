<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyacetal resin
composition and a sliding member composed of the polyacetal
resin composition. More particularly, it relates to a
polyacetal resin composition for a sliding member which has
an excellent workability (moldability) for molding such as
an injection molding without causing a separation and/or
bleeding of the ingredients thereof, and a sliding member
composed of the polyacetal resin composition, which is
remarkably improved in sliding characteristics such as a
friction coefficient and a wear resistance with no
deterioration of mechanical properties, and substantially
prevents generation of frictional sound (grating sound) on
sliding.Polyacetal resins have excellent mechanical
properties, frictional and wear characteristics, heat and
chemical resistance properties and electrical properties,
and are widely utilized as engineering plastic for
manufacture of various kinds of machine parts such as
automobile parts, and parts of electrical and electronic
devices. With the increasing tendency of the
miniaturization and light-weight of these parts, there is
an increasing request for a sliding member material which
is improved in sliding characteristics such as a friction 
coefficient and a wear resistance without lowering the
mechanical properties and generates no grating sound on
sliding. Several proposals have been made for improving
such sliding characteristics and preventing generation of
the grating sound.Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 46-42217
proposes a process for producing the lubricating parts such
as bearings, which comprises preparing a thermoplastic
synthetic resin powder composed of a polyacetal or
polyamide; mixing a lubricating oil therewith and stirring
the resultant mixture so that the lubricating oil is
uniformly deposited on the resin powder-particle surfaces;
melting, kneading and granulating the obtained mixture by a
granulator in which the molding material feed section of a
heating cylinder is kept at a low temperature below the
melting point of the synthetic resin by a cooling means,
while the other section of the heating cylinder is
maintained at a temperature above the melting point of the
synthetic resin; and molding the granulated material into a
desired form.Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 48-37572
(U.S. Patent No. 3,779,918) proposes an oil-containing
plastic composition for a sliding member, obtained by
adding at least one of a saturated or unsaturated higher
fatty acid, or a salt, ester, amide, chlorinated
