<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are provided for efficiently 
and effectively coating a substantially flat surface, 

i.e., a substrate, with a high-viscosity liquid chemical, 
such as photoresist. The flat surface is oscillated by 

rotating the surface in one direction and then repeatedly 
reversing the direction of rotation of the surface. The 

chemical is spread by both the centrifugal force of the 
rotation of the surface and the tangential force of the 

angular acceleration of the surface. The tangential force 
helps spread the chemical without prematurely overcoming 

the surface tension of the chemical resulting in a 
particularly effective coating using substantially less 

chemical. Chemical is alternatively spread by vibrating 
the flat surface. Vibrating applies to the chemical, in 

addition to radial, centrifugal force, if any, non-radial 

forces which are not directly opposed by surface tension. 
The chemical is therefore spread more evenly and 

efficiently without overcoming the surface tension of the 
chemical. Vibrating is accomplished either (i) by 

oscillating the surface with a low amplitude and a high 
frequency or (ii) by quickly moving the surface in a 

small, circular motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thin-film coatings
of flat substrates such as semiconductor wafers and flat
panel displays, and in particular to spin coating large
surfaces with photoresist and similar high-viscosity
chemicals.In the fabrication of semiconductors, a wafer is
coated with photoresist or a similar high-viscosity liquid
chemical by spinning the wafer and applying an amount of
the liquid chemical to the center of the spinning wafer.
(As used herein, the term "liquid" is not limited to
fluids of low-viscosity and, in fact, can refer to highly
viscous chemical substances.) Until recently, spin
coating has been mostly confined to coating circular
surfaces or small square mask plates. However, spin
coating is now used to apply chemicals to thin film heads,
multi-chip modules, and flat panel displays which are
square or rectangular and are often very large. Spin
coating such surfaces presents primarily two problems.First, the corners of a square or rectangular surface
are poorly covered. The chemical being applied to the
surface is spun to the edge where excess is thrown from
the surface by centrifugal force. Chemical leaving the
center of an edge is struck by the corner of the spinning
surface as the corner is further from the center of the
surface than is the center of an edge. Such a collision
disrupts the even flow of chemical from the center of the
surface to the corners of the surface. Secondly, spin coating larger surfaces results in
striations in the chemical coating toward the edges and
corners of the surface as a result of uneven drying of the
chemical. To cover a large surface before the chemical
i dries, the chemical is applied to a surface spinning at a
normal speed and the speed of the spinning surface is then
ramped up, i.e., gradually increased, as the chemical
spreads. Increasing the spin rate spreads the chemical
more quickly and potentially before the chemical thickens
substantially.The surface tension of the chemical on the spinning
surface is what causes the chemical to spread evenly
during spinning. However, as the spinning rate is
increased, the centrifugal force overcomes the surface
tension of the chemical. This is especially true on
larger surfaces such as large flat panel displays or when
small volumes of chemical are used. When the surface
tension is overcome, the smooth circular shape of the
spreading chemical bursts like a bubble and the chemical
then streams linearly toward the edges of the spinning
surface in multiple radial paths. These multiple radial
paths

surface moves in a circle, the circles having equal

diameters.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the circles
defined by the movement of each point on the surface have

fixed centres.
An apparatus for applying a layer of a liquid to a
