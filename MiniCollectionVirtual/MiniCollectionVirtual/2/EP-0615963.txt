<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to silicon nitride
sintered bodies which have superior mechanical
properties at room temperature, with a minimized
scattering of the properties, and also good
productivity and cost efficiency.Silicon nitride is a material well balanced in
strength, fracture toughness, corrosion resistance,
wear resistance, thermal shock resistance and
oxidation resistance, etc., and has been extensively
used in a wide variety of applications, such as
cutting tools, frictionally sliding parts or other
structural materials. However, there is the problem
that this ceramic material is poor in strength and
reliability as compared with metallic materials.One reason for the poor strength of the silicon
nitride sintered body is closely related to the grain
boundary phase in the silicon nitride sintered body.
The grain boundary phase is composed of a glass phase
formed from a sintering aid, which is an indispensable
component for sintering silicon nitride. In general,
since this glass phase is brittle as compared with the
matrix phase of the sintered body, it is highly
susceptible to breakage when stress concentration is
applied to the grain boundary phase. This causes the 
lowering of the strength of the sintered silicon
nitride sintered body.Therefore, various methods have hitherto been
tried to improve the strength by reducing the grain
boundary phase of a silicon nitride sintered body.
For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(Kokai) Nos. 2-70715 and 3-117315 disclose techniques
for reducing the thickness of a grain boundary phase
by forming a grain-refined structure composed of
equi-axed crystal grains of α-Si3N4 and prismatic
crystal grains of β-Si3N4. However, in order to
obtain fine α-type crystal grains, a fine Si3N4 powder
having a high α-ratio should be used as a starting
material powder, resulting in a high production cost.
Further, in order to ensure an improved strength
properties in the resultant silicon nitride sintered
body, the conversion rate to β-crystallization should
be increased by sintering. However, in this sintering
process, the β-type crystal grains grow to 2 µm or
more. Therefore, there is limitation in reducing the
grain boundary phase only by the above-mentioned
structural refinement technique.Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Nos. 61-91065 and 2-44066, there has been known a
method for combining equi-axed α'-sialon having the
general formula Mx(Si,Al)12(O,N)16 wherein M is at
least one member selected from the group consisting of
Mg, Ca, Li
