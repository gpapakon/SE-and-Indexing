<ABSTRACT>
Device for communication between private telephone 
networks having their own exchange (2,3,9,12,14 or 17), 

characterized in that in each of the exchanges in between 
which communication should be possible, it contains an 

emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) which is connected to the 
exchange and has been accorded an identification number, 

and a transparent signalling network (6,16,19) between 
the emulators of said exchanges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for communication between 
private telephone networks having their own exchange. Private networks with their own exchanges, also called 
PBXs, have protocols which offer enormous possibilities 
such as automatic calling when a busy line becomes free, 
the automatic distribution of incoming calls, conference 
calls, mail-box, etc. However, not all these 
possibilities are offered everywhere by the public 
telephone network. Thus, when the exchanges of private networks communicate 
via the public telephone network, one can normally not 
make use of these possibilities. Swapping of special 
signals would be required to this end which cannot be 
sent over the ordinary public telephone network. This 
can be done, however, via rented lines and this is why 
the known devices for communication between private 
telephone networks contain such a rented line from the 
public network, together with the necessary, usually 
quite complicated protocols to link the exchanges to one 
and other via the rented line. Such rented lines are expensive, however. The invention aims to remedy this disadvantage and to 
provide a device for communication between private  
 
telephone networks which makes the use of the ordinary 
lines of the public telephone network or a transit 
network with similar equipment as the public telephone 
network possible, such that communication between private 
networks is made possible without any special rented 
lines while still prevailing the possibilities and 
facilities of the private telephone networks. This aim is reached according to the invention because 
the device, in each of the exchanges in between which 
communication via switched telephone services should be 
possible, contains an emulator which is connected to the 
exchange and has been accorded an identification number, 
and a transparent signalling network between the 
emulators of said exchanges. Practically, each emulator hereby contains means to 
analyze incoming signals, means to identify the emulator 
of a calling network via a databank and means to 
establish an ordinary telephone connection via the public 
telephone network or a transit network between the 
exchanges. The signalling network may be a voice frequency line of 
the public network, a separate channel, a data 
transmission network, etc. There is also a possibility 
to send the signals over the voice frequency channel 
itself (in-band) in order to avoid having to use any 
additional channels. According to a particular embodiment of

<CLAIMS>
Device for communication between private telephone 
networks having their own exchange (2,3,9,12,14 or 17), 

characterized in that in each of the exchanges 
(2,3,9,12,14 or 17) in between which communication via 

switched telephone services should be possible, it 
contains an emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) which is 

connected to the exchange and has been accorded an 
identification number, and a transparent signalling 

network (6,16,19) between the emulators (4,5,11,13,15 or 
18) of said exchanges (2,3,9,12,14 or 17). 
Device according to the above claim, characterized in 
that each emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) contains means to 

analyze incoming signals, means to identify the emulator 
(4,5,11,13,15 or 18) of a calling network via a databank 

and means to establish an ordinary telephone connection 
via the public telephone network (1) or a transit network 

between the exchanges (2,3,9,12,14 or 17). 
Device according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in that each of the emulators (4,5,11,13,15 

or 18) contains means to establish a carrier connection 
via the public telephone network (1) or a transit network 

with an emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) to be called in 
order to, when it is called, start the signalling 

connection with a calling emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) 
via the signalling network (6,16,19) provided this 

connection was not active yet, and to thereby swap the 
required checking data with the calling emulator 

 
(4,5,11,13,15 or 18) and to transmit the private 

signalling protocols of the exchanges (2,3,9,12,14 or 17) 
via the signalling network (6,16,19). 
Device according to the above claim, characterized in 
that each emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) contains means to 

transmit its identification, i.e. the identification of 
the calling emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) when the 

carrier connection is established. 
Device according to any of claims 3 and 4, 
characterized in that the means to transmit the private 

signalling protocols via the signalling network (6,16,19) 
contain means to transmit the abbreviated number for 

direct dialing-in (private numbering) of the called party 
and the calling party. 
Device according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in that the signalling network (6,16,19) is 

a separate voice frequency line of the public telephone 
network, a separate channel, a data transmission network 

or the carrier connection for the voice frequency itself 
(in-band), and whereby the emulator can simultaneously 

support several signalling methods. 
Device according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in that an emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) 

corresponding to an exchange (2,3,9,12,14 or 17) of a 
private network is mounted on the front side of the 

exchange, i.e. between said exchange and the public 
network (1) or the transit network, such that the 

emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) handles the signalling of 
the public network (1) or the transit network. 
Device according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in that an emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18)

private network is mounted on the back side of the 

exchange, in which case the exchange (2,3,9,12,14 or 17) 
itself provides the access to the public telephone 

network (1) or the transit network. 
Emulator from the device according to any of the above 
claims, which contains means to analyze incoming signals, 

means to identify the emulator (4,5,11,13,15 or 18) of 
the calling network via a databank and means to establish
