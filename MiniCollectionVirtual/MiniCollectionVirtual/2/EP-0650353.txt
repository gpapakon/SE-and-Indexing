<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical granular composition and method for taste masking bitter, unpleasant tasting drugs comprising a drug core and as a taste masking agent methacrylate ester copolymers. The method comprises coating the drug cores with separate layers of aqueous dispersions of the copolymers. Additionally, the coating composition may contain plasticizers and conventional excipients. The granules of the present invention can be used in the preparation of chewable tablets which have good palatability and bioavailability. Preferable copolymers are poly(ethylacrylate, methylmethacrylate) to which quaternary ammonium groups have been introduced to modify the permeability of the ester. The coating sytem of this invention releases the drug by diffusion and is influenced by drug solubility and media pH.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition and method for taste masking bitter,
unpleasant tasting medicaments and provides for an immediate release of the
medicament after injestion. More specifically, the invention relates to medicament
cores coated with methacrylate ester copolymers which masks the bitter and unpleasant
taste of the medicament. A method of preparing dosage units such as chewable tablets,
employing the coated medicament is also described.In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the composition comprises a
chewable tablet containing cimetidine coated with separate layers of methacrylate ester
copolymers. The tablets do not exhibit the bitter taste of cimetidine arid provides for an
immediate release of the cimetidine.Cimetidine is a histamine H2-antagonist which has been shown to be useful in
the treatment of duodenal, gastric, recurrent and stomal ulceration. It is also employed
in the management of patients who are at high risk from hemorrhage of the upper
gastrointestinal tract.Cimetidine is known to be one of many medicaments to have a pronounced
bitter taste. This is not usually a problem when the dosage form employed is a capsule
or a tablet designed to be swallowed, thereafter to disintegrate upon reaching the
stomach. However, such dosage forms can be impractical when it is desired to
administer a large amount of active ingredient, or to co-administer a relatively bulky 
second active ingredient such as an antacid or alginate. Moreover, many individuals
have difficulty in swallowing a solid dosage formA conventional approach to administering relatively large amounts of active
ingredient in a solid dosage form is by means of a chewable tablet, i.e., a tablet
which disintegrates in the mouth upon being chewed. Such a tablet also circumvents
the problem of a solid dosage being difficult to swallow.It will be appreciated that a major requirement of such a dosage form is that it
must be palatable, since an unpalatable formulation increases the risk of a patient
neglecting to take the tablet. Such non-compliance with the dosing regimen will in
turn delay or prevent the patient's recovery from the condition under treatment.A further requirement of such a composition is that once the disintegrated
tablet reaches the stomach, the individual particles should release the active ingredient
rapidly and completely in order to ensure that substantially all of the active ingredient
is absorbed; that is to say the formulation should be readily bioavailable.In the case of cimetidine, because of
