<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus using quick-drying printing ink, premature drying of residual printing ink remaining on the printing plates (9, 11) of the forme cylinder (7, 8) following the printing operation is avoided. This takes place due to the fact that the forme cylinders, the ink transfer device and the ink feed device are sealed off relative to the back pressure cylinder. Subsequently, an ink-solvent/air mixture is introduced into a chamber which is located between a printing point and an ink transfer zone of the forme cylinder and extends in the axial direction of the forme cylinder.

Encapsulated printing group with forme cylinder (7; 8),
arranged in a chamber (6; 15), with a device for supplying (14,

12; 16, 13) printing ink to the forme cylinder (7; 8) via an
inking zone (40; 45), characterized in that a number of nozzles

(36; 37; 38; 39) for spraying an ink-solvent/air mixture onto the
forme cylinder (7; 8) are provided in the chamber (6; 15) between

pressure line (29; 31) of the forme cylinder (7; 8) with a
cylinder (3) associated with the latter and the inking zone (44

[sic]; 45) on the forme cylinder (7; 8), as seen in the direction

of rotation of the forme cylinder (7; 8).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that a
plurality of nozzles (36; 37; 38; 39) are arranged side by side

in the end faces (30; 35) of the chamber (6; 15), in the axial
direction of the forme cylinder (7; 8).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
nozzles (36; 37; 38; 39) are designed as fan-jet nozzles.
Device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that an
inking roller which dips into an ink trough is provided as the

device (14; 16) for supplying ink to the forme inking roller (12;
13).
Device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
device (12, 14; 13, 16) for supplying ink comprises the forme

inking roller (12; 13) with a chamber doctor (14; 16) arranged
thereon.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in that the forme
inking roller (12; 13) is designed as a hard, engraved anilox

roller.
