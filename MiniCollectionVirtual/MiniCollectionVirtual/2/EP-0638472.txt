<ABSTRACT>
A rubber crawler mounted on an under carriage of a mobile work machine 
wherein there is caused neither localized transverse slip of the rubber 

crawler nor rocking of core metals, whereby wheels are prevented from coming 
off, the crawler from coming off, and the core metals from peeling off, thereby 

improving the durability thereof. In the present invention, the respective core 
metals (4) embedded in the rubber crawler main body at equal intervals are 

provided with at least a pair of horizontal projections (5a, 5b) projecting in a 
direction normal thereto at the widthwise sides of the engaging portion which 

is at the central position along the length of the crawler, and with adjacent horizontal 
projections confronting each other, the tip portions thereof are arranged 

so as to produce a three-dimensionally overlapped state (d) in which 
they overlap each other over a certain length thereof in the left and right directions, 

as well as at least in either upward or downward directions thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber crawler to be attached to an
under-carriage of a traveling construction machine.Steel caterpillers have usually been attached to the under-carriages of
traveling construction machines, but in recent years rubber crawlers have
been applied as well.FIGURE 8 shows a conventional rubber crawler 16 on which an inner-flanged
idler wheel 19 is rolling. The reference numeral 11 is a core bar.
The reference numerals 12, 13 and 14 indicate a wing portion, a protruding
part to prevent disengagements of a wheel, and an engaging part with a
driving wheel, respectively, all of the core bar 11. The numeral 17 is a
steel cord, 18 is an engaging hole, 19c is a center rolling part of the
idler wheel 19. As shown in this figure, the center rolling part 19c
travels between the protruding parts 13, 13 so that disengagements of the
wheel can be prevented.Compared with a steel crawler, the above rubber crawler has the disadvantage
that disengagements of the crawler may easily happen. This is
mainly because the rubber crawler is partially twisted to thereby disengage
from the wheel, when it turns on a stepped ground in the workshop. FIGURE
9 shows a disengagement of the wheel. The crawler is slided sideways
between the adjacent core bars 11, 11, and therefore the center rolling
part 19c of the inner-flanged idler wheel 19 runs on the protruding part 
13, thereby causing the disengagement of the wheel from the crawler.To overcome this problem, increasing the widthwise strength of the
rubber crawler may be considered.Then, if the interval of core bars in the rubber crawler is narrowed as
the width thereof is broadened in order to increase the strength of the
rubber crawler, the widthwise edge portions of each core bar become angulate
at their turning points, which places the rubber crawler in a polygonal
shape. Accordingly, the rubber crawler suffers much bending fatigue, and
therefore its durability decreases.On the other hand, if a short-pitched rubber crawler (wherein the core
bars' interval is half of the conventional rubber crawler's core bar
interval by embedding core bars of narrower width arranged for the interval)
is applied in order to increase the strength, it is excellent in preventing
disengagements of the wheel because of the narrower interval of the embedded
core bars than in a conventional rubber crawler's, and is excellent in the
durability as well. However, this has not become a perfect means yet, but
still causes disengagements of the crawler in a large-sized

<CLAIMS>
A rubber crawler, wherein a core bar (1; 1a, 1a'; 1b, 1b') is provided with
protruding parts (2) on both sides of a central part (3) and forms a track for a wheel, said

core bar (1; 1a, 1a'; 1b, 1b') being provided with at least one horizontal projection (5a,
5b, 5c, 5d) on each widthwise side face of the core bar so as to project in a direction

normal to the side faces of the core bar, wherein said core bares are embedded in the
crawler main body at equal intervals in a circumferential direction of the crawler (6, 6a,

6a') so that tips of confronting horizontal projections overlap with each other in a
widthwise direction of the core bar,

characterized in

that there is provided a protruding part (2) on each side of the central part (3)
so as said protruding parts (2) form a track for an inner-flanged wheel and said central

part (3) forms an engaging part for a sprocket;
that said horizontal projections (5a, 5b, 5c, 5d) are formed below said
protruding parts (2) so that their tips overlap at about a half depth of the crawler body,

around which steel cords are embedded, and wherein said tips of the confronting
horizontal projections are in a three-dimensionally overlapped state in which they overlap

with each other over a certain length thereof in left and right directions as well as upward
and downward directions.
A rubber crawler according to claim 1, characterized in that a tip central
position of a horizontal projection (5a) of the core bar (1) is caved into a cave (s), while

a tip a of a confronting horizontal projection (5b) of an adjacent core bar (1) is provided
with a nipple (t) to enter into the cave (s).
A rubber crawler according to claim 1, characterized in that a horizontal
projection (5a, 5b) of the core bar (1a, 1a'; 1b, 1b') is formed to be sectionally concave 

or L-shaped, while a confronting horizontal projection (5c, 5d) of the adjacent core bar is
formed to be sectionally convex, L-shaped, or stick-shaped so as to enable a three-dimensionally

overlapped state with each other between the embedded core bars.
A rubber crawler according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
bottom faces of the engaging part (3) of the core bar (1) and both ends thereof are thickened

to be somewhat lower than the wing portions (4) of the core bar, and the horizontal
projections (5a, 5b) are provided to the thickened parts.
A rubber crawler according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
long slender concave grooves (U, U') are provided to either one of or both of a grounding

face and a nongrounding face of the rubber crawler (6a') at somewhat outer positions to
the side faces of the rubber crawler from the overlapped portion of the horizontal

projections (5a, 5b, 5c, 5d) between the core bars (1b) embedded in the rubber crawler
body, and said concave grooves (U, U') are partially along a circumferential direction of

the rubber crawler.
A rubber crawler according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a
part of a rubber layer on the overlapped portion of the horizontal projections between the

core bars embedded in the rubber crawler body and its vicinities is partially removed on
either one of or both of the grounding face and the nongrounding face so that the
