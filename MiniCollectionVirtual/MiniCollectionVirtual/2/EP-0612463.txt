Device (10) for formation of a film on the walls of small holes made in the boards (20) for printed circuits, said boards translating and immersed in a special liquid product (13) contained in a bath (12), comprising one or more sets of pressure nozzles (33) alternating with further sets of ''suction'' nozzles (32) disposed orthogonally in the bath (12) at the points where the boards (20) pass along, and a pump (50) connected at its entry (37) to the suction nozzles (32) and at its exit (36) to the pressure nozzles (33) thus determining within the holes opposite flowing currents of liquid (13) so as to increase the motion between said liquid (13) and the walls of said holes, and thus accelerating and improving formation of the film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for formation of a film on the
walls of small holes in boards for printed circuits.A device for the formation of such films, according to the
preamble of claim 1, is disclosed in EP-A-0 424 798. The circuit
boards are immersed in a special bath so that
a protective or antioxidizing film, or some film to improve
surface quality, may be formed on said boards and
especially on the walls of the holes bored through them.
The components of said bath determine chemical reactions
on the copper surfaces forming what is known as chemical
tin or chemical copper or other products.In mass production methods the boards follow each other
through the bath moved along by some means of transport.
This is clearly a lengthy process partly because the film
deposited must be as uniform as possible.The major difficulty arises over forming the film on the
walls of the very small holes made in these boards since
passage of the liquid through them is hindered by their
minute diameters and also because their walls lie orthogonally 
to the direction in which the boards move especially
if this movement is parallel to their greater surfaces.While the horizontal disposition of the boards may be optimum
from the structural and functional standpoints, it
does not facilitate action by gravity of the chemical agents
on the sides of the above holes which, as said above, lie
orthogonally to the surfaces of the boards.Purpose of the present invention is to shorten working
times and also to ensure the best possible formation of
film inside the holes, as will be explained below.Subject of the invention is a device for forming a film
on the walls of small holes bored in printed circuit boards
by immersion of said boards in a tank containing a specific
liquid product.One or more sets of nozzles, orthogonal to board movement,
are placed in the tank in a position corresponding to that
of the boards, said tank also containing a pump that continually
takes up liquid and returns it to the bath under
pressure applied through said nozzles.In this way currents of liquid are made to flow through
said holes.The chemical reaction between the bath's components and
the copper sides of the holes can result in formation of a
film of chemical tin, chemical copper or of some other
substance, as the case may be.A special mechanism causes the boards to move along continuously
on a level parallel to their greater surface and
to the free surface of the liquid.Preferably the tank contains sets of 'suction' nozzles
through which liquid

<CLAIMS>
Device (10) for formation of a film (43) on the walls of small holes (42) in
boards (20) for printed circuits by chemical reaction obtained during their

immersion in a liquid product (13) contained in a bath (12), wherein the
device comprises at least one set of suction nozzles and at least one set of pressure nozzles

orthogonally to said boards during said immersion and aligned in a
position transversely to said moving direction of said boards and comprises

a pump (50) that continually takes up liquid (13) from the bath (12)
through said set of suction nozzles (32) and returns it under pressure to said bath (12)

through said set of pressure nozzles (33) creating currents (40, 41) of said liquid
passing directly from said nozzles to said boards through the holes (42)

back and forth therein to increase movement between the liquid (13) and
the walls of said holes (42) to accelerate and improve formation of the film

(43). 
Device (10) as in claim 1

characterized in that the film (43) is of chemical tin.
Device as in claim 1

characterized in that the film (43) is of chemical copper.
Device (10) as in claim 1

characterized in that specially provided mechanisms (21)
(22) determine continuous translation,on the level,of the

Device (10) as in claim 1

characterized in that a specially provided mechanism (21)
(22) determines continuous translation, on the level, of

the boards (20), parallel to their greater surface and
to the free surface of the liquid (13), there being one or

more sets of suction nozzles (32) by which the liquid (13)
is drawn up from the bath (12), alternating with other sets

of pressure nozzles (33) by means of which the pump (50) 
returns the liquid (13) to the bath (12), this setting up
