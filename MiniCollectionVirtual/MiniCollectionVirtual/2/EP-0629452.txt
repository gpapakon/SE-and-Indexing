<ABSTRACT>
A method for decreasing the drying time of a wet coating by admixing said 

wet coating and a predetermined amount of at least one transient colorant, applying 
the admixture to a substrate, and causing or allowing the coating to dry. The 

transient colorant may be, for example, a pH-sensitive colorant or a photobleaching 
colorant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to decreasing the drying time of an aqueous coating.Coating compositions may be applied to many structures. Aqueous and nonaqueous coating compositions must
dry before the protective and aesthetic properties of the compositions can be fully achieved. The drying time of the coating
composition is particularly important for aqueous coatings dried outside as the drying rate is adversely affected by
high humidity and, at the same time, rain, or even heavy dew, may cause a catastrophic failure such as washout of the
coating film. The problems of achieving quick drying for aqueous compositions are aggravated when the composition is
low in solids content or is applied as a thick coating. The drying time of a coating composition depends on its temperature;
colored coatings drying outdoors with incident sunlight may achieve a higher temperature and higher drying rate
than white coatings owing to the greater absorption of radiative energy by a colored coating.Unfortunately, in many cases a colored coating is undesirable or unacceptable for functional and/or for aesthetic
reasons. For example, white coatings are known to significantly reduce the surface temperature of roofs relative to dark
colors. This reduction in surface temperature, which may be as much as 45 Â°C, may drastically lower the energy requre-ments
for air conditioning and may lessen the thermal shock associated with rain striking a hot roof. Such roof coatings
are typically fairly thick - a dried coating thickness of 30 to 40 mils is common - and drying may be slow. Slow drying
may hamper the application of subsequent coatings, particularly in the case of thick coatings on roofs where it is necessary
for an operative to walk on the first coating during the application of the second coating.Australian Patent AU 49046/72 discloses a surface coating composition incorporating a colouring substance which
may be faded or leached out of the paint within a relatively short time. Expressly disclosed is a modified white or pastel
coloured paint which is difficult to apply uniformly to a surface which has been precoated with a paint of the same colour.EP-A-0488980 discloses a wet hiding power developing system which does not alter the dry hiding power in a paint
composition, which has a dry hiding power higher than the wet hiding power.The problem faced by the inventors was increasing the drying rate of an applied coating composition without permanently
altering its appearance.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is
