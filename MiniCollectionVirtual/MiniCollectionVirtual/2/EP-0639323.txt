<ABSTRACT>
2. Proceeding from a harvester for green-fodder preparation, which has at least one pressing device provided for accelerating the process of drying reaped stalk crop and consisting of at least two mutually assigned elements, particularly rollers, the elements forming a press nip, through which the stalk crop is guided to form a stalk-crop mat, and at least one element (one roller) of the pressing device being elastically deformable and its surface profiled, the object is, in addition to an optimum cohesion of the pressed stalk-crop mat, primarily to guarantee an optimum and the greatest possible discharge of moisture, whilst maintaining a requisite pressing force, is achieved in that the at least one element or its profiling is designed in such a way that the stalk-crop mat is pressed so as to be wave-like at least on one side.
