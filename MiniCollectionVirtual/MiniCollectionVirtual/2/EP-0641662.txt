<ABSTRACT>
A multiplexed array of resistors including a 
plurality of address leads and a plurality of ground 

leads which cooperatively define a matrix of nodes, each 
node defining a possible location in the matrix for a 

resistor heater interconnecting one address lead and one 
ground lead. Resistor heaters are located in the array 

at only a portion of the nodes. The locations of the 
resistor heaters are selected to limit the conductance of 

alternate current paths around the resistor heater when 
addressed. The resistor heaters are preferably formed at 

nodes selected so that no two address leads are 
interconnected through resistor heaters to more than one 

common ground lead. Preferably, each alternate current 
path includes at least four non-addressed resistors in 

series.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for multiplexing 
an array of resistor heaters in a thermal inkjet printhead, and more particularly to an 
apparatus and method for multiplexing an array of resistor heaters to form a sparse 
array for limiting current flowing to non-addressed resistors. Thermal ink jet printers and are well-known in the art, as described in U.S. 
Patents 4,490,728, and 4,313,684. A thermal ink jet printer includes an array of 
printing cells formed on a printing head, which in turn is mounted on a replaceable, 
disposable housing having one or more ink reservoirs. In the following discussion, an 
array of resistor heaters will be portrayed schematically as a rectilinear matrix made 
up of rows and columns of resistor heaters. Each printing cell includes a small ink 
reservoir, a printing nozzle, and an electrically driven resistor heater formed opposite 
the printing nozzle. The resistor heater of each cell is connected to a current source 
by an address lead and a ground lead. The printing cells and required electrical leads 
are typically formed on a silicon substrate by known photolithographic deposition, 
metallization and etching techniques. In operation, the printing cell is fired by 
switching one or both of the address and ground leads to direct a current through the 
resistor heater. The heat generated by the current in the addressed resistor heater 
vaporizes a portion of the ink in the reservoir, ejecting a drop of ink through the 
printing nozzle onto a medium such as a sheet of paper. The performance and print quality of a thermal ink jet printhead can be 
enhanced by increased the printing cell density on the printhead. Printing cell density 
on the printhead is limited in part by the space occupied by conductive leads which 
electrically connect the array of printing cells to the control circuitry of the printer. 
Printing cell density could therefore be increased if fewer conductive leads were 
required to electrically connect the array.  Fig. 1 depicts one known arrangement for reducing the number of conductive 
leads in which each resistor heater is connected to a separate address line 10, while 
each ground lead 12 is connected to multiple resistor heaters R. This arrangement 
requires 54 leads for 50 resistor heaters, a relatively high number. Turning now to FIG. 2, a fully multiplexed array, shown generally at 20, 
requires the fewest number of leads. A fully multiplexed array is one in which all the 
resistor heaters 22 in each row are
