<ABSTRACT>
A reagent for testing an antibody of hepatitis C by using as an antigen a peptide containing an essential peptide comprising 
a specified sequence having an epitope of an HCV structural region, Arg 
Xaa
 Gly Pro Arg Leu Gly Arg Arg Pro, wherein 
Xaa represents preferably Leu, Lys or Arg. The reagent serves to detect an antibody against the HCV structural region specifically 

at a high detection rate, whereby HCV infection can be tested accurately in an early stage. The necessary peptide can be chemically 
synthesized readily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reagents for 
testing for hepatitis C and a method of testing 
for the same. According to recent studies, the number 
of patients suffering from non-A non-B hepatitis is 
estimated to be about 2 million in Japan, of which 90-95% 
are hepatitis C. The molecular structure of the hepatitis C virus 
(hereinafter referred to as HCV) which is responsible 
for hepatitis C is being clarified; in recent years, 
several reagents to detect the presence or absence of 
antibodies against HCV (HCV antibodies) have become 
commercially available. As to HCV markers which have been put in practical 
use to date, C-100-3 antigen corresponding to a part of 
NS-3 to 4, which is the non-structural region of HCV, 
is known (Science 244, 359-362, 1989). The use of the 
C-100-3 antigen as the HCV marker makes it possible to 
analyze antibodies against HCV for the first time ever. 
However, when subjects who were infected with HCV were 
actually tested using the C- 100-3 antigen, a problem  
 
remained; that is, only about 70% of the subjects 
tested HCV positive and the remaining 30% tested false 
negative. On the other hand, it was reported that when 
an ELISA kit for detecting HCV antibodies containing 
the C-100-3 antigen was actually used for screening 
blood for transfusion, as much as 1.5% of the blood 
tested positive, out of which nearly half showed false 
positive. Later, in order to improve HCV antibody detectability 
and to detect HCV in an early stage of infection, 
the use of the HCV core region as an antigen was 
proposed. Several kits for detection of HCV antibodies 
using the HCV core region protein as an antigen have 
been studied; these kits are called second generation 
kits against the above-mentioned kits in which the C-100-3 
antigen is used. An attempt was made, wherein 
one synthesized peptide corresponding to an epitope of 
the core region protein combined with a synthetic 
peptide corresponding to two epitopes in the above-mentioned 
non-structural region of HCV, i.e., NS-3 to 
4, in order to detect HCV antibodies (Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. USA 88, 3647-3651, 1991). The specificity of 
detection by this method was better than that with the 
use of the C-100-3 antigen as an HCV marker; however, 
since only one epitope in the core region was selected, 
antibodies produced against epitopes other than this  
 
epitope could not be detected, which resulted in insufficient 
detectability for antibodies against HCV. Several epitopes which react with antibodies 
against the core
