of the reactive distillation column to one or more

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention rotates to a process for 
synthetizing urea by starting from ammonia and carbon 
dioxide, with total conversion of CO₂ being obtained. All industrial processes for preparing urea are 
based on the direct synthesis according to the 
reaction:

2NH₃ + CO₂ ⇄ CO(NH₂)₂ + H₂O   (1)


 
   Actually, this reaction takes place in two well 
distinct steps:

2NH₃ + CO₂ ⇄ (NH₂)COONH₃   (1a)(NH₂)COONH₄ ⇄ CO(NH₂)₂ + H₂O   (1b)


 
   The first step is an exothermic equilibrium 
reaction having a high reaction rate already at room 
temperature, but a favourable equilibrium, at such 
high temperatures as required by reaction (1b), only 
under high pressures; the second reaction is 
endothermic, with a meaningful reaction rate only at 
high temperatures (higher than, or equal to, 150°C) 
and an equilibrium which, at 185°C, leads to a 
conversion of only approximately 53% of CO₂: this 
value can be suitably increased by increasing the 
ratio of NH₃/CO₂, but is considerably decreased in the 
presence of water. Water has a negative effect also on 
the kinetics of the reaction: its presence causes 
therefore particularly negative effects on the overall 
reaction. According to the classic industrial processes, 
the synthesis is carried out inside a single-stage  
 
reactor fed in co-current mode, from the bottom, with 
NH₃, CO₂ and aqueous solution of recycled ammonium 
carbonate, at temperatures comprised within the range 
of from 170 to 200°C, under pressures comprised within 
the range of from 150 to 250 atm, with a molar ratio 
of NH₃/CO₂ in the feedstock comprised within the range 
of from 2.5 to 4.5. The product discharged from 
reactor head displays conversions of 60-65% of fed 
CO₂. Besides formed water and excess NH₃ used, the 
effluent stream from the reaction contains large 
amounts of CO₂ as non converted ammonium carbamate. 
The separation of urea from these products is carried 
out in a specific section of the facility, in which 
basically some flash treatments are carried out at 
high temperature and under decreasing pressures in 
order to decompose carbamate into NH₃ and CO₂ and 
simultaneously remove these products and any reaction 
water, with urea being made available for the 
subsequent prilling step. The carbamate separation section displays low 
operation costs, thanks to the recovery of a large 
amount of heat from the unit, but, simultaneously, 
requires extremely high costs of investment which 
cause enormous increases in end product costs. From this section of the facility, all
