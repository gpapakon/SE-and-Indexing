<ABSTRACT>
Film edges 9, 9 of a film web 1 are sensed by means of sensing heads 4, 4. The sensing heads 4, 4 are motively displaceable transversely relative to the longitudinal direction of the film web 1. The displacement results in signals which are proportional to the displacement and which activate servovalves 8, 8. These servovalves are connected to actuating cylinders 10, 10 which are themselves connected to chain-conveyor deflecting heads 6, 6. The signals from the servovalves activate the actuating cylinders which then adjust the chain-conveyor deflecting heads and thus move these up to the film edges. As a result of the adjustment of the chain-conveyor deflecting heads, the conveyors of the clip chains 14, 14 are also adjusted, thus resulting in a variation in the gripping depths, that is to say in the film strip retained by the clips. This brings about an oscillating movement of the film web after entry into the transverse stretching frame 16.

Process for homogenising the winding hardness of a film reel, in which a longitudinally
stretched prefilm enters a transverse stretching frame having two dip chains

which are guided around chain-path deflector heads, so that the film edges are
grasped by the clips of the dip chains, wherein at the entrance to the transverse

stretching frame a sensor head provided at each film edge senses the film edge and
the chain-path deflector heads at the entrance to the transverse stretching frame

are driven following the movement of the film web, characterised in that the sensor
heads are displaced transversely to the longitudinal direction of the film web and

with respect to the chain-path deflector heads, and in that the displacement of the
sensor heads is controlled, so that the positions of the dips together with the dip

chains are so adjusted that the grasping depth of the dips changes.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the grasping depths of the
dips for the edge regions of the film web are controlled as a function of time on both

sides.
Process according to daim 1, characterised in that there are present on the two
sensor-head holders motor-adjustable setting screws whose adjustment is

controlled electronically.
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that the sensor heads are moved
in an oscillating manner during their motor adjustment.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that the grasping depths of the
dips are adjusted by the oscillating displacement of the chain-path deflector heads,

and in that downstream of a first fixed spindle of the chain path, the film web
osdllates.
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that the sensor heads are displaced
at a rate of from 1 to 2 mm/minute with respect to the chain-path deflector

heads. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that the overall path for the displacement
of the sensor heads is up to 15 mm.
Device for homogenising the winding hardness of a film reel, having a transverse
stretching frame (16) having two clip chains (14) which are guided around chain-path

deflector heads (6), and clips (13) for grasping the film edges (9), wherein there
is located at the entrance to the transverse stretching frame (16) a control having a

sensor head (4) at each film edge (9) for sensing the film edges (9), by means of
which control the chain-path deflector heads (6) at the entrance to the transverse

stretching frame (16) are driven following the movement of the film web (1), characterised
in that each of the sensor heads (4) is displaced by means of a displacement

device (5, 12) transversely to the longitudinal direction of the film web (1) and with
respect to the chain-path deflector heads (6), and in that the displacement of the

sensor heads (4) is controlled by means of a control device (7), so that the positions
of the dips (13) together with the clip chains (14) are so adjusted that the grasping

depth of the dips (13) changes.
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that the sensor heads (4, 4) have an
adjustable setting screw (5, 5), it being possible for the sensor head (4, 4) to be

displaced transversely to the film web (1) by the adjustment of the setting screw
(5, 5) and the adjustment of the setting screw (5, 5) being carried out by means of

the control device (7).
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that each of the sensor heads
(4, 4) is connected to a servo valve (8, 8) which is activated by a signal of the

sensor head (4), initiated by a displacement of the film edges (9, 9) of the film web
(1).
Device according to claim 10, characterised in that each of the two servo valves
(8) is connected to a positioning cylinder (10), in that the signals of the servo valves

activate the positioning cylinders, and in that the positioning cylinders (10, 10) adjust 
the chain-path deflector heads (6, 6) according to the displacements of the film

edges (9, 9).
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that the individual setting screw (5)
passes through a sensor-head holder (11) and in that the adjustment of the individual

setting screw (5) is carried out by means of a stepping motor (12) which is
connected to the setting screw and is activated by the control device (7).
