<ABSTRACT>
In resistive or capacitive absolute pressure sensors produced in thin-layer technology using the means of surface micro-mechanics, in the case of a capacitive sensor the electrodes have a high insulation resistance with respect to one another, the diaphragm is subjected, in the finished condition, only to a low tensile stress, no sublimation step is necessary to prevent the adhesion of the diaphragm to the base body, the diaphragm supplies a measuring signal in a further pressure range, even when it is resting on the base body, the measuring signal is practically temperature-independent and only a few chemical vapour deposition and photolithography steps are necessary. A capacitive thin-layer absolute pressure sensor (10, 20, 30, 40) has, for this purpose, a glass substrate (11, 21, 31, 41) as base body and a diaphragm (15', 25', 35', 45') which bound a hermetically closed cavity (18, 28, 38, 48), the base body carrying, on the side of the cavity, a base electrode (12', 22', 32', 42') with connecting first conductive tracks (14, 34, 44) or corner pads (24), the diaphragm consists of the material of a first insulating layer (15, 25, 35, 45) which at least partially sticks fast to the base body at the edge of the cavity, carries on that side of the diaphragm facing away from the cavity a covering electrode (16', 26', 36', 46') and a second insulating layer (19, 29, 39, 49) which completely covers the covering electrode and the diaphragm and hermetically seals the cavity and the covering electrode is extended, outside the diaphragm, in second conductive tracks (17, 27, 37, 47) which extend on the first insulating layer. In the case of a resistive sensor, the base electrode is omitted and the covering electrode is replaced by a half-bridge or a full bridge made of piezoelectric resistors. Four production method versions are disclosed.

A thin-film process for manufacturing a capacitive
absolute pressure sensor (30) with a base element and a

diaphragm (35') which bound a hermetically sealed cavity
(38), comprising the following steps in the order given:


a) depositing a first metal layer (32) over the entire
surface of a glass substrate (31) serving as the

base element, said first metal layer containing a
substrate electrode (32') to be formed;
b) depositing over the entire surface a first
patternable aluminum layer containing a first

partial layer (33') of a sacrificial layer (33) to
be formed, said first partial layer (33') defining

a first part of the height of the cavity (38);
c) patterning the first patternable aluminum layer and
the first metal layer (32) in a single, first

photoresist step by etching, for simultaneously
forming the substrate electrode (32'), first

interconnection tracks (34) connected therewith,
and the first partial layer (33'), which is

virtually congruent with the substrate electrode
and the first interconnection tracks;
d) depositing over the entire surface a second
patternable aluminum layer which defines the remainder

of the height of the cavity (38) and
contains a second partial layer (33") of the

sacrificial aluminum layer (33) to be formed and
two diametrically opposed corner extensions (310),

and patterning said second patternable aluminum
layer in a second photoresist step such that it

completely covers the first partial layer (33'); 
e) depositing a first insulating layer (35) of SiO
2

containing the diaphragm (35') over the entire
surface, whereby it firmly adheres to the areas of

the glass substrate (31) still exposed after step
d), and etching openings (330) into the first

insulating layer (35) of SiO
2
 above the corner
extensions (310) for the subsequent supply of an

etchant to the sacrificial aluminum layer (33);
f) forming, in a photoresist layer deposited over
the entire surface, a photoresist mask whose

opening is congruent with a top electrode (36') to
be formed and with second interconnection tracks

(37) connected therewith and is centered with
the substrate electrode (32') without the corner

extensions (310);
g) depositing a second metal layer containing the
top electrode (36') over the entire surface of the

photoresist mask;
h) removing the photoresist mask with the overlying
portions of the second metal layer (36) by a

lift-off step;
i) removing the sacrificial aluminum layer (33) by
vertical etching and lateral etching through the

openings (330); and
k) hermetically sealing the openings (330), and thus
the cavity (38), by depositing a second insulating

layer (39) in a vacuum.
A thin-film process for manufacturing a capacitive

surface, whereby it firmly adheres to the areas of

the glass substrate (41) still exposed after step
