<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for the remote backup of numerical data organised into files contained in a local mass memory (19) of a computer system (5, 6, 7, 8). It includes a means (11) of reading numerical data in the said mass memory, a means (12) for recognising files modified since the previous backup, a means (15) of enciphering data, a means (31) of compressing enciphered data and a local means (16) of transmitting enciphered and compressed data to an integrated services digital network (1). Where receiving these data, it includes, connected to the said network, a transmitted-data processing means (30) associated with global mass memories (26, 27) preserving the transmitted data and with an automatic numbering means (35), the said data processing means controlling the operation of the automatic numbering means, the operation of the electronic circuit and the operation of the global mass memories (26, 27).

<CLAIMS>
Remote back-up device for digital data organised in
files contained in a local bulk memory (19) of a

computer system (5, 6, 7, 8), characterised in that it
comprises, for each site for which back-up is required,

an electronic circuit (4) connected to said computer
system comprising a means for reading digital data (11)

from said bulk memory, a means for recognising files
(12) modified since the previous back-up adapted to

select the files that have been modified since the
previous back-up, a computer virus detection means (13)

adapted to detect computer viruses in said data, a
means for encrypting data (15), a means for compressing

encrypted data (31) and a local means (16) for
transmitting encrypted and compressed data over an

integrated services digital network (1) and in that it
comprises, connected to said network, a means for

processing transmitted data (30) associated with global
bulk memories (26, 27) preserving the transmitted data

and with an automatic numbering means (35), said data
processing means controlling the operation of the

automatic numbering means, the operation of the
electronic circuit and the operation of the global bulk

memories (26, 27).
Device according to Claim 1 characterised in that it
further comprises, in the electronic circuit, a means

(14) for identifying the computer system adapted to
verify that the computer system to which the electronic

circuit is connected is identical to that used during
the previous back-up.
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2 characterised
in that the data processing means (30) is adapted to

activate automatically the operation of the automatic
numbering means, the operation of the electronic 

circuit and the operation of the global bulk memories
(26, 27) as a function of a back-up timetable.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the electronic circuit further

comprises a means (32) for decontaminating the files to
be backed up.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the electronic circuit is

incorporated into a housing (3, 9, 10) further
comprising a means for detecting whether it has been

opened.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the data processing means (30)

and the global bulk memories (26, 27) are in two
different locations.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the electronic circuit further

comprises a storage means (21) adapted to preserve all
the data to be backed up.
Remote method for backing up digital data organised in
files contained in a local bulk memory of a computer

system connected to an integrated services digital
network, characterised in that it automatically

performs a numbering on said network, a reading of
digital data from said bulk memory, a recognition of

files modified since the previous back-up adapted to
select the files that have been modified since the

previous back-up, a computer virus detection adapted to
detect the computer viruses in said data, an encryption

of data, a compression of the encrypted data, a
transmission of the encrypted and compressed data over

an integrated services digital network, a processing of 
the transmitted data, an archiving of the transmitted

data.
Method according to Claim 8 characterised in that it
further performs the partitioning of data before its

archiving.
Method according to one of Claims 8 or 9 characterised
in that it performs an installation 
in the local bulk
memory (19) of the computer system (5, 6, 7, 8) of a

file comprising data representative of the progress of
said method.
