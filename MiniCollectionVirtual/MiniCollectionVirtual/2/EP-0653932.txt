<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use of indoline derivatives, in particular 5,6-dihydroxyindoline, as agents to produce an artificial tan on the skin. Preparations, for topical application, containing such agents give the skin a natural-looking brown hue. The invention also concerns artificial-tan preparations containing indoline derivatives and dihydroxyacetone.

<CLAIMS>
The use of indolines corresponding to formula I: 

 
in which R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ independently of one another 

represent hydrogen or alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 
carbon atoms or R⁴ and R⁵ represent hydroxyalkyl groups 

containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms or, together with the 
oxygen atoms to which they are attached, represent an 

alkylene dioxy group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
or salts thereof for tanning the skin. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
one of the groups R¹, R² and R³ in formula I is a methyl 

group and the others are hydrogen. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the indoline corresponding to formula I is 5,6-dihydroxyindoline. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the indolines corresponding to formula I or salts 

thereof are applied to the skin in the form of a water-based 
cosmetic preparation with a pH value of 4.0 to 7.5 

and an indoline content of 0.01 to 10 mmoles and preferably 
0.1 to 3 mmoles per 100 g of the preparation. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the water-based cosmetic preparation is an oil-in-water 

emulsion. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the water-based cosmetic preparation is a gel. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in  
 

that the indolines corresponding to formula I or salts 
thereof are applied to the skin in the form of a water-based 

cosmetic preparation containing a main group, 
transition or lanthanide metal salt selected from the 

group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, 
calcium, strontium, aluminium, titanium, vanadium, 

manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, silver, gold, zinc, 
cerium, lanthanum, europium, gadolinium and dysprosium. 
The use claimed in claim 7, characterized in that 
the water-based cosmetic preparation contains a chloride, 

bromide, sulfate, acetate, lactate or citrate, of lithium, 
magnesium, calcium, aluminium, iron, cerium or 

lanthanum. 
Skin tanning preparations containing indolines 
corresponding to formula I or salts thereof in a quantity 

of 0.01 to 10 mmoles and preferably in a quantity of 0.1 
to 3 mmoles, dihydroxyacetone in a quantity of 0.05 to 10 

g and preferably in a quantity of 0.2 to 5 g per 100 g of 
the preparation and a water-based cosmetic carrier.
