<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarization 
independent semiconductor optical amplifier or 
amplifying apparatus for amplifying a light signal 
or the like that is transmitted in an optical 
communication, and an optical communication 
system or network using the optical amplifier. An optical amplifier or amplifying apparatus for 
amplifying a light signal without using any opto-electric 
and/or electro-optic conversions is widely used in optical 
communication systems. Such an optical amplifier is a 
key device which is indispensable for the prolongation 
of relay distances for an optical transmission. As a means for attaining an optical amplifier, 
a method of utilizing nonlinear scattering in an 
optical fiber, such as the Raman or the Brillouin effect, 
can be used. However, a traveling wave type optical 
amplifier, which uses the gain function of a semiconductor 
laser (LD), has been widely studied since it has 
the advatages of being compact, using a small amount of  
 
electric power, having structural simplicity and 
so forth. The traveling wave type optical amplifier 
can be expected to have characteristics such as its 
wavelength band of gain range being wide and that it 
can obtain a stable state of operation, regardless of 
variations in temperature. Generally, a traveling wave type optical 
amplifier has a structure in which antireflection films 
are respectively formed on opposite end surfaces of a 
buried-structure laser diode (LD) and its active layer 
has typically a thickness of 0.1µm and a width of 2µm. 
As a result, the gain of such a traveling wave type optical 
amplifier is largely dependent on polarization due to its 
asymmetry in thickness and the width of the active layer. 
Thus, an optical amplifier of this type exhibits a 
difference in gain of several decibels for light 
components having different polarization states. The polarization state of a light signal that is 
propagated through an optical fiber would be fluctuating. 
Therefore, an error is caused at the time of signal 
receiving if the gain of an optical amplifier is strongly 
dependent on polarization, as discussed above. 
In general, although the waveguide structure of an active 
layer only has to be equalized (its thickness is increased 
and its width is narrowed) in order to reduce the 
dependency of gain on polarization for incident light, the 
thickness and width need to be set below 0.5µm × 0.5µm to  
 
keep a single mode condition. However, it 
is difficult to achieve such a size using present 
technologi
