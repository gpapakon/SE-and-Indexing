<DESCRIPTION>
Cationic lipid compounds are disclosed, having utility in
lipid aggregates for delivery of macromolecules and other
compounds into cells.Lipid aggregates such as liposomes have been found to be
useful as agents for delivery to introduce macromolecules, such
as DNA, RNA, protein, and small chemical compounds such as
pharmaceuticals, to cells. In particular, lipid aggregates
comprising cationic lipid components have been shown to be
especially effective for delivering anionic molecules to cells.
In part, the effectiveness of cationic lipids is thought to
result from enhanced affinity for cells, many of which bear a net
negative charge. Also in part, the net positive charge on lipid
aggregates comprising a cationic lipid enables the aggregate to 
bind polyanions, such as nucleic acids. Lipid aggregates
containing DNA are known to be effective agents for efficient
transfection of target cells.The structure of various types of lipid aggregates varies,
depending on composition and method of forming the aggregate.
Such aggregates include liposomes, unilamellar vesicles,
multilameller vesicles, micelles and the like, having particle
sizes in the nanometer to micrometer range. Methods of making
lipid aggregates are by now well-known in the art. The main
drawback to use of conventional phospholipid-containing liposomes
for delivery is that the material to be delivered must be
encapsulated and the liposome composition has a net negative
charge which is not attracted to the negatively charged cell
surface. By combining cationic lipid compounds with a
phospholipid, positively charged vesicles and other types of
lipid aggregates can bind DNA, which is negatively charged, can
be taken up by target cells, and can transfect target cells.
(Felgner, P.L. et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
84:7413-7417; Eppstein, D. et al., U.S. Patent 4,897,355.)A well-known cationic lipid disclosed in the prior art is
N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride
(DOTMA). The structure of DOTMA is:
 
DOTMA by itself or in 1:1 combination with dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
(DOPE) is formulated into liposomes using standard
techniques. Felgner, et al. supra demonstrated that such
liposomes provided efficient delivery of nucleic acids to some
types of cells. A DOTMA:DOPE (1:1) formulation is sold under the
tradename LIPOFECTIN (Gibco/BRL: Life Technologies, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD). Another commercially available cationic lipid
is 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy) -3-3-(trimethylammonia) propane (DOTAP),
which differs from DOTMA
