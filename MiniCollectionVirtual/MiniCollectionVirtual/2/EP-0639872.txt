(46) therein and having a plurality of conductive surfaces 
formed thereon. The connector includes a socket (10) formed to 

include an elongated slot (14) for receiving the daughtercard (16) 
therein and including a plurality of electrical terminals (18) 

for engaging the plurality of conductive surfaces formed on 
the daughtercard for electrically coupling the daughtercard (18) 

to the socket (10). The connector also includes an ejector (22) 
coupled to an end of the socket (10). The ejector (22) includes 

first and second side panels (40,42) defining a slot (32) therebetween 
for receiving the end edge of the daughtercard (16) therein, and 

first and second raised surfaces (48,50) formed on the first and 
second side panels (40,42) of the ejector (22), respectively, for 

engaging opposite sides of the daughtercard (16) to apply a 
retention force directed normal to the daughtercard (16) upon 

insertion of the daughtercard (16) into the socket (10). The ejector (22) 
also includes a locking head (44) formed integrally with the 

first side panel (40) and configured to engage the notch (46) formed 
in the daughtercard (16) to provide a vertical retention force 

to the daughtercard (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical
connector socket having an ejector mechanism for removing a
daughtercard or module from the socket. More particularly,
the present invention relates to an improved electrical
connector which provides a retention force when the
daughtercard is inserted into the socket and also permits
the daughtercard to be easily ejected from the socket when
desired.It is well known to provide electrical connector
sockets, such as Single In-line Memory Module (SIMM)
sockets, for interconnecting a first printed circuit board
or mother board to a second printed circuit board or
daughtercard. Typically, the sockets are formed to include
an elongated slot and a plurality of electrical terminals
coupled to the housing adjacent to the slot. When the
daughtercard is inserted into the slot of the socket,
conductive surfaces on the daughtercard engage the
terminals to couple the daughtercard to the socket
electrically. The terminals are also coupled to conductive
traces on the mother board so that when the daughtercard is
inserted into the socket, the daughtercard is electrically
coupled to the mother board. For examples of SIMM socket
configurations see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,013,264
to Tondreault and U.S. Patent No. 5,254,017, owned by the
assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein
by reference.One problem associated with conventional
electrical connectors is that it is often difficult to
extract a daughtercard that is held in a socket formed in
an electrical connector. It is understood that a plurality
of sockets may be located adjacent each other with
daughtercards in each of the sockets. In such tight 
quarters it is often difficult for a technician to remove a
selected daughtercard from the connector socket manually by
hand or using a tool. Unless precautions are taken, the
daughtercard can be damaged during extraction of the
daughtercard from the socket. Therefore, it is desirable
to provide an ejector mechanism coupled to the socket to
facilitate ejection of the daughter card from the socket.It is known to provide ejectors coupled to the
sockets to assist with the removal of daughtercards from
the socket. One such ejector is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,147,211 to Tondreault et al. The '211 patent
discloses an ejector for selectively ejecting one of first
and second daughtercards located in adjacent elongated
slots of a socket. The device disclosed in the '211 patent
therefore provides means for selectively ejecting first and
second daughtercards

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector for receiving a daughtercard
(16), said daughtercard having an end edge (34) formed to include a notch (46)

therein and having a plurality of conductive surfaces formed
on said daughtercard, the connector (10) comprising:


a socket (10) formed to include an elongated slot (14) for
receiving the daughtercard (16) therein and including a

plurality of electrical terminals (18) for engaging the
plurality of conductive surfaces formed on the daughtercard

(16) for electrically coupling the daughtercard (16) to the
socket (10); and
an ejector (22) coupled to an end of the socket (10), the
ejector (22) including means (40, 42) for applying a first

retention force to the daughtercard (16) in a direction normal to the plane of the daughtercard upon insertion of the
daughtercard (16) into the socket (10) to retain the

daughtercard (16) within the socket (10), a locking head (44)
configured to engage the notch (46) formed in the daughtercard

(16) to apply a second retention force to the daughtercard directed in the plane of the daughtercard
(16), and means (38) for ejecting the end edge (34) of the

daughtercard (16) adjacent the ejector (22) out of the 
elongated slot (14) upon movement of the ejector (22) relative
