<ABSTRACT>
A sheet-pile wall for the vertical sealing of liquid-bearing and/or gas-bearing strata, in particular for sealing contaminated earth strata, the sheet piles which form the sheet-pile wall being connected by locks which each consist of two parts interlocking in a hook shape and are sealed with a sealing compound, and a method of producing it. The sheet-pile wall and the method meet all requirements of the current guidelines for constructing vertical diaphragm walls for the construction of landfill sites and the redevelopment of old waste sites, namely, for example, verification of the verticality, verification of the integrity of the locks, means of repairing the lock seal. In order to provide such a sheet-pile wall and method, in each case one part (1) of the lock (2) has longer webs (5, 6) than the other part (7) in the direction of the profile height of the sheet pile (4) towards the hook end, and both parts (1, 7) of the lock (2) form between them a vertical lock chamber (8) which is filled with a sealing compound (9). The procedure used to produce it is that the part of the lock of the trailing sheet pile with the longer webs towards the hook end is subsequently driven into the respectively leading part of the lock of interlocking sheet piles with the shorter webs towards the hook end while the vertical lock chamber is formed, whereupon the lock chamber is filled with the sealing compound.

<CLAIMS>
Steel sheet piling for the purpose of vertically sealing strata containing liquid
and/or gas, in particular for sealing contaminated strata, wherein the steel

sheet piles forming the steel sheet piling are connected to each other in each
case by means of closing arrangements (2) whose mutually engaging closing

parts hook into each other in each case and comprise thickened triangular
heads adjacent to which are in each case cross pieces (5, 6) which are

approximately perpendicular to the steel sheet piling axis, are substantially
parallel to each other and are connected by a closing arrangement base

which extends substantially parallel to the steel sheet piling axis, wherein the

mutually facing triangular base areas of the triangular heads mutually
engage each other substantially filling the closing arrangement join and are

sealed with a sealing mass (9), characterised in that in each case a dosing
part (1) of the closing arrangement (2) comprises cross pieces (5, 6) which

are longer in the direction of the profiled height of the steel sheet pile (4)
perpendicular to the sheet piling plane and substantially parallel to each

other than the other closing part (7) and the two closing parts (1, 7) of the
closing arrangement (2) form between themselves a vertical closing

arrangement chamber (8) which is formed between the parallel cross pieces
(5, 6) and between the closing arrangement base of the closing part (1)

comprising the longer cross pieces (5, 6) and the triangular head of the other
closing part (7) and which is filled with a sealing mass (9) which is

introduced after inserting the steel sheet piles.
Steel sheet piling according to claim 1, characterised in that the closing part
(1) of the closing arrangement (2) comprising the longer cross pieces (5, 6)

is a separate profiled part.
