<ABSTRACT>
An electronic component device (A1) has a lead electrode at the edge thereof. A support member (A2) is opposed to the 
electronic component device with a gap (G) between them, and has an external connection terminal (A5) at the position opposing 

a lead electrode (A4). A resin layer (A3) is disposed between the electronic component device (A1) and the support member (A2) 
and is spaced apart by a distance (d) from the edge of the electronic component (A1). The resin layer (A3) bonds the electronic 

component device (A1) to the support member (A2). The distance (d) satisfies the relation G 
<
 d. A conductive agent (A6) is 
filled into the gap (G) between the lead electrode (A4) and the external connection terminal (A5) and into the space defined between 

the resin layer (A3) and the edge of the electronic component device (A1) having the distance d, and connects the lead (A4) 
to the external connection terminal (A5). When an electronic component is fitted to a printed board, inferior connection between 

the lead electrode and the external connection terminal does not occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic components such as
piezoelectric parts and the like.The best known electronic component of this type to date
comprises an electronic element, a supporting member, a resin layer
and a solder. As shown in FIG. 11, the electronic element B1 has a
lead electrode B4 at the edge, and the supporting member B2 is
positioned opposite the electronic element B1 across a gap G. The
supporting member B2 has an external connecting terminal B5 which
extends from the front surface to the bottom surface of the supporting
member B2 at a location that faces the lead electrode B4 across the
notch. The resin layer B3 is positioned between the electronic element
B1 and the supporting member B2 and bonds the electronic element B1
to the supporting member B2. The solder B6 fills the space at the
notch and connects the lead electrode B4 with the external connecting
terminal B5.However, as shown in FIG. 12, the electronic component of the
prior art has a problem in that when it is mounted on a printed board
P, the solder B6 which connects the lead electrode B4, which is formed 
adjacent to the electronic element B1, with the external connecting
terminal B5, which is formed adjacent to the supporting member B2,
tends to remelt and become absorbed into the solder S applied to the
printed board P, resulting in a defective connection between the lead
electrode B4 and the external connecting terminal B5.Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol.15, No. 280 (E-1090), 16 July 1991
and JP-A-03 097312 (Murata), 23 April 1991 discloses an electronic
component comprising a piezoelectric element having a lead electrode at
one edge, a supporting member positioned at a location which faces the
piezoelectric element across a gap, and an external connecting terminal
which faces the lead electrode. However, no solder is employed in the
construction of this electronic component.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
electronic component of which defective connections including
disconnections due to solder bridging are prevented.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
electronic component which can be directly mounted on a circuit board
by soldering the external connecting terminal to the conductors formed
on the circuit board.A further object of the present invention is to provide an
electronic component of which the filling solder, which connects the
lead electrode with the external connecting terminal, does not remelt
and thus precludes to become absorbed into the paste solder
