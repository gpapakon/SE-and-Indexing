<ABSTRACT>
The precipitation of aluminum compounds following 
the contact of aluminum compounds following the contact of 

an aluminum-containing subterranean formation with an acid 
solution containing hydrofluoric acid, is reduced or avoided 

by including in the hydrofluoric acid at least one hydroxy 
carboxylic acid to provide from 0.2 to 10% by weight of the 

resulting solution. Preferred acids are -hydroxy acids such 
as citric, tartaric, malic, lactic and hydroxyacetic acid. 

The acid compositions and their use are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a
composition for acidizing oil and gas wells, whereby
aluminum- and silicate-containing formations can be acidized
with reduced aluminum compound precipitation.In well acidizing procedures for increasing the
permeability of subterranean formations containing aluminum
and silicates, e.g. sandstone, aqueous acid solutions
containing hydrofluoric acid are often utilized. The
hydrofluoric acid reacts with aluminum and silicate
materials in the formations including clays and feldspars.
A common problem involved in such acidizing procedures is
the precipitation of reaction products, principally basic
aluminum and aluminum-fluoride compounds, many of which
occur almost immediately upon the spending of the acid
solution and the elevation of the solution pH to a value
between 2 and 3.In addition to the immediate precipitation
problems, precipitation can also occur after the
hydrofluoric acidizing treatment is completed. This later
precipitation has been called "alumino-silicate scaling" and
is believed to be caused by spent hydrofluoric acid solution
in the formation subsequently mixing with formation brine
whereby the pH is caused to increase which in turn causes
the precipitation.There is thus a need for a new way of acidizing 
such formations using hydrofluoric acid compositions,
whereby the precipitation of aluminum compounds is reduced.GB-A-2 177 145 is concerned with an acidizing method for improving the permeability of
subterranean formations. GB-A-2 177 145 further teaches retarding reaction between the acid
and components of the subterranean formation, and reducing mobility of fine
particulate matter in the formation after acidizing has been completed. Nowhere in
GB-A-2 177 145 however is there any disclosure or suggestion that the subject acid compositions
might be used to reduce aluminium compound precipitation in a subterranean
formation.According to the present invention, there is
provided a use of an acid solution in reducing the precipitation of aluminum
compounds following contact of an aluminium-containing subterranean formation with the
acid solution, the acid solution comprising hydrofluoric acid and at least one hydroxy
carboxylic acid, the hydroxy carboxylic acid being present in an amount of from 0.2% to
10% by weight of the solution.In the use of the invention, the hydroxy
carboxylic acid or acids function as a buffering agent in
the acid solution which delays the increase in pH and the
onset of precipitation. In addition, the hydroxy
