<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises a computer (1) adapted to receive and store booking data at the time when a room is booked, such as type of room and time period for availability of a certain room or rooms. A card reader is arranged for each room or room group and an electrically controlled lock for the door to the respective room for movement between locked and open positions by means of coded cards containing data for adaptation of the chosen room only during a chosen time period. The system comprises a number of checking-in units (3) comprising an account card reader (7) positioned in or proximate the building in which said room is located. The identification data for the guest's account card is read on the guest's arrival, and upon occurrence of said booking-in identification data in the computer, allows passage to the common area. The card readers and locks for the rooms are included in a room system which includes an electronic room module adapted to receive and store information about said identification data and booking data. Upon reading of the information from the account card in said card reader for the room, after acceptance of the card, the appropriate door lock is activated in the same way as a key. A checking-out unit (3) comprises an account card reader (7) which, upon checking-out using the account card in the reader, adds together and calculates the entire costs for charging to the corresponding account and ceases the card's function as a key for access to the common areas as well as to the particular room.

<DESCRIPTION>
_. Computer System for Automatically Making Rooms Available.* The present invention relates to a computer system according to the preamble of appended claim 1.Hotels have computer systems for the collection and storage of data which is obtained upon booking and during the hotel 5 stay so as to produce a bill which can be paid in cash, or for example by charging the guest's credit card account with the costs. It is also known to use key cards which are provided with a code containing data on the choice of room and the agreed period of stay. With these systems, each 10 door to the respective room is provided with a card reader, by means of which the door lock is moved between locked and open positions.However, with the use of conventional technology, personnel are still reguired for serving the guests during checking-15 in and checking-out which normally requires round-the-clock manning and results in annoying delays for the guest. This can be particularly disturbing for a guest upon arrival after a journey or upon departure when departure times have to be kept. Additionally it does occur that guests escape20 without paying for their stay.The object of the present invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problems and to limit the requirement for personnel to be for other services in order to better accommodate the guest's requirements of comfort and 25 assistance as well as ensuring payment for the stay.This object is achieved by means of a computer system according to the present invention which has the features defined in the appended claims. 

 The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an embodiment in the accompanying drawing, in which fig. 1 shows the central part of the computer system according to the invention and fig. 2 schematically shows a part of the computer system arranged for each room according to the invention.The core of the invention lies in that an arriving guest should be able him/herself to automatically obtain access to a room by using a credit card or the like as the door key, by means of which credit card the guest's account can be charged with the costs that the guest incurs during his stay. The card can be one of many different types of account card, e.g. charge card, credit card, so-called smart-cards or the like. Many cards contain fixed information which give the identification data for the actual business and which are coupled to the account holder's account. The so-called "smart-cards" can also contain modifiable information which can be
