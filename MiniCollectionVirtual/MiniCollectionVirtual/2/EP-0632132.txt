<ABSTRACT>
A method for the identification of agents which 
inhibit chitin synthesis, thus exhibiting potential fungicidal 

and insecticidal activity, involves the incubation 
of test samples in neutral 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 cultures 
containing calcofluor white, a fluorochrome that 

causes lethal chitin hyper-polymerization in the yeast. 
Cultures containing samples that inhibit chitin synthesis 

exhibit enhanced growth because the growing fungus is 
rescued from the adverse effects of calcofluor white. In 

the practice of the invention, the test sample is added to 
a 
S. cerevisiae
 culture or culture area containing calcofluor 
white and the culture is incubated with the test 

sample for such time under such conditions sufficient to 
observe yeast cell growth inhibition in a corresponding 

culture or culture area containing calcofluor but no test 
sample. The extent of growth in the culture or culture 

area containing test sample is then compared with the 
extent of growth in the culture or culture area containing 

no test sample, and the presence of chitin synthesis 
inhibition is determined by observation of whether culture 

growth in the presence of test sample exceeds growth in 
its absence. Preferred embodiments employ test samples on 

disks or in wells in solidified cultures and a known 
chitin synthesis inhibitor as a positive control which is 

compared to the test sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the identification of
potential fungicides and insecticides using a screening
method that reverses the calcofluor inhibition of chitin
biosynthesis in yeast.The polysaccharide chitin is a structural cell wall
component of all fungi except some Basidiomycetes fungi
and most Oomycetes, and is the most abundant organic
skeletal component of invertebrates, making up, for example,
from about 25 to 60% of the dry weight of insect
cuticles. Chitin consists primarily of linear polymers of
the amino sugar N-acetyl-D-glucosamine joined in 1,4-Î²-glucosidic
linkage. Thus, chitin bears a close resemblance
to cellulose, the major structural polysaccharide
of plants; indeed, the only chemical difference between
them is that in chitin the hydroxyl group on the 2-position
is an acetoamido group instead of an hydroxyl.
However, because of its widespread occurrence in fungi and
arthropods, the total world-wide production of chitin
vastly exceeds cellulose (Neville, A.C., The Biology of
the Arthropod Cuticle, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1975,
pages 71 to 76).Many fungi and arthropods having chitinous cell walls
or exoskeletons are injurious to plants and animals,
causing a legion number of diseases. To name but a few,
fungal species containing chitin cause wheat eyespot, rice
sheath blight, damping off, apple scab, pepper botrytis, 
rice blast, sugar beet cercospora, tomato early blight,
wheat leaf rust, and wheat powdery mildew. Fungal species
also cause myriad cutaneous and systemic mycoses in human
beings and other animals, including candidiasis, histoplasmosis,
blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis,
and the like. Insects are vectors of viruses causing
arboviral encephalitides, yellow fever, and dengue, protozoa
causing malarias, trypanosomiases, and leishmaniases,
and various harmful helminths. Crustaceans carry some
infectious helminths and trematodes.Most fungicides and insecticides that are used to
control or cure these diseases by killing or controlling
their causative agents, intermediate hosts, or vectors
employ various modes of action including physical poisons
that suffocate or dessicate organisms; protoplasmic poisons
such as arsenicals that kill by precipitating or
deactivating proteins, enzymes or other cellular constituents;
respiratory poisons that deactivate respiratory
enzymes; and various poisons that affect different tissue
systems such as tubules or nerves. Of course, preferred
agents do not injure the host plant or animal, and most
preferably have no effect whatsoever

<CLAIMS>
A method for screening for the presence or absence of chitin synthesis
inhibition by a test sample, which comprises:


(a) adding said test sample to a culture of a fungus that produces chitin, said
culture containing calcofluor white or a calcofluor white derivative;
(b) incubating said test sample in said culture for such time under such
conditions sufficient to observe cell growth inhibition in a corresponding

culture containing calcofluor white but no test sample;
(c) comparing the extent of growth in said culture containing test sample with
the extent of growth in a portion of a corresponding culture containing no

test sample; and
(d) determining the presence of chitin synthesis inhibition by observation of
whether growth in the presence of test sample exceeds growth in its

absence.
A method according to claim 1 wherein said fungus that produces chitin is a

Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 strain sensitive to calcofluor white.
A method according to claims 1, or 2 further comprising the step of providing,
as a control, a 
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 culture containing a known chitin
synthesis inhibitor but no test sample.
A method according to claim 3 wherein the known chitin synthesis inhibitor is
nikkomycin.
A method according to claim 4 wherein

in step (a) said culture is culture plate of a solidified neutral culture of 

Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
 containing the disodium salt of calcofluor white using
a strain of 
S. cerevisiae
 that exhibits little resistance to calcofluor white;
and said test sample is added in a well or on a disk;
in step (d) further determining the presence of said chitin synthesis inhibition by
observation that growth in the vicinity of positive control exceeds growth in the

rest of the culture.
A method according to claims 1, 2, 4 or 5 further comprising the step of
rescreening, in a secondary assay of chitin synthase inhibition, test samples that

exhibit more growth in the presence of test sample than in its absence.
A method according to claim 6 wherein the assays for chitin synthase inhibition
are 
in
vitro
 assays comprising adding the test sample to a culture of a yeast
strain that relies on the expression of a single chitin synthase for survival,

incubating the test sample in the culture for such time under such conditions
sufficient to observe yeast cell growth in a corresponding culture containing no

test sample, comparing the extent of growth in the cultures, and determining
synthase inhibition by observation of whether growth in the absence of test

sample exceeds growth in its presence.
A method according to claims 6 or 7 wherein the secondary assays comprise
assays for chitin synthase isozyme 1, chitin synthase isozyme 2, or chitin

synthase isozyme 3.
