<ABSTRACT>
A switch, distribution switch or junction box for electric building installations consists of a pot-shaped housing closable by means of a lid, with cable and pipe entrances, claw-shaped fastening arrangements and machine and lid fastening arrangements. In order to make it possible to simultaneously install mains supply and signal lines, at least one detachably securable elastic partition extends parallel to the floor and allows the housing to be subdivided into two chambers.

installations comprising a pot-shaped casing which may be closed by a cover and 

which has cable- and tube entrances, claw mounting means, apparatus- and cover 
mounting means and a partition (13) which is oriented generally parallel to the 

bottom, which may be detachably locked, which has through openings (20) and by 
which the casing is separated in two chambers (14, 15),
characterized by
 
connecting branches (18) for conduits which project from the casing (11) and which 

lead in the region of the elastic partition (13) into both chambers (14, 15), and 
charcacterized in that the casing (11) is narrowed in the region of the connecting 

branches (18).
