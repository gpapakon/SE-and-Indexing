<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a photographic element 
comprising a support bearing a light-sensitive 

photographic silver halide layer containing (1) a 
bicyclic azole coupler (2) an azopyrazolone masking 

coupler and (3) a low impact development inhibitor 
releasing (LIDIR) coupler having at least one hydrogen 

atom at the coupling site and which does not 
substantially reduce contrast in the layer in which it 

is coated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements containing azopyrazolone masking couplers used 
to correct for unwanted absorption in color negative 
film. More particularly, it relates to such elements 
containing a "low impact" development inhibitor 
releasing coupler which serves to improve the raw stock 
keeping without undue degradation in other photographic 
properties such as fog, contrast, or granularity. The use of 4-phenylazopyrazolone masking 
couplers is known in the art. See, for example, U.S. 
2,455,170; U.S. 2,428,034; U.S. 2,808,329; U.S. 
2,434,272; U.S. 2,704,711; U.S. 2,688,539; U.S. 
3,796,574; U.S. 3,476,560; U.S. 4,427,763; EP 213,490; 
and U.S. 4,777,123 as well as those identified in 
Research Disclosure December 1989, Section VII, Part G, 
Publiched by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., Dudley 
Annex, 12A North Street, Emworth, Hampshire PO10 7DQ, 
England. These compounds have proven useful since they 
are yellow colored in unexposed areas and magenta 
colored in exposed areas. Thus, when in reality the 
magenta dye formed in a color negative photographic 
process has a small but significant unwanted absorption 
in the blue range, this may be balanced somewhat by the 
relative loss of blue absorption due to conversion of 
the mask color from yellow to magenta in the exposed 
areas. Then, an adjustment can be made to the spectral 
content of the light used to produce the positive from 
the negative to effectively cancel out the unwanted 
blue absorption which is now relatively constant across 
both the exposed and unexposed areas of the negative.  While 4-phenylazopyrazolone masking couplers 
have been employed as a means of offsetting the 
unwanted blue absorption of conventional magenta 
couplers, this means for improving the color rendition 
has created several deficiencies in the photographic 
material related to the raw stock keeping of the 
element. First, the presence of these masking couplers 
results in increased fogging (non-imagewise silver 
development) of the photographic emulsion. This is 
thought to be due to undesired reactions which occur 
either in the raw stock prior to development or which 
occur during the development process itself, either of 
which results in the formation of a phenyldinitrogen 
species from the masking coupler. This species can 
then act as a powerful reducing agent for silver 
emulsions. The result is undesired non-imagewise 
silver development which manifests itself as fog. 
Thus, the Dmin (minimum density) of the photographic 
material
