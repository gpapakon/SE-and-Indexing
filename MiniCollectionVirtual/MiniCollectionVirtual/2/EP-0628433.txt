<ABSTRACT>
An eraser excellent in erasing performance even when applied under a weak rubbing force, which is made from a chlorine-free 
styrenic or olefinic thermoplastic eleastomer as the base material so that it can be incinerated without emitting any toxic chlorine-containing 

gas. The first embodiment thereof comprises a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer, an oily matter and a gelling 
agent. The second embodiment comprises a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer and a styrenic oligomer. The third embodiment comprises 

an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer and has a number of microvoids therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an eraser for erasing
handwriting written with a pencil or a mechanical pencil.
In particular, the invention relates to an eraser excellent
in erasing performance even when it is applied under a weak
rubbing force like a polyvinyl chloride eraser, which can be
incinerated without emitting any toxic chlorine-containing
gas.Erasers leave refuse after being used. The base
material of polyvinyl chloride erasers which have
prevalently been used is polyvinyl chloride which is a
compound that contains a large amount of chlorine.
Therefore, when the refuse is incinerated, a toxic
chlorine-containing gas is emitted to cause air pollution.
On the contrary, thermoplastic elastomer erasers are very
favorable, because they do not contain any chlorine compound
and hence are free from the above problem. Among them,
styrenic and olefinic elastomers are particularly suitable
for use as the material of erasers, since they highly adsorb
carbon powder constituting handwriting written with a pencil
or a mechanical pencil to exhibit an excellent erasing 
performance.However, when the styrenic or olefinic thermoplastic
elastomer is used singly, it will not be abraded even when
rubbed strongly, since it has a high breaking strength and
thus it does not function as an eraser. Therefore, it is
combined with a factice or resin usually incorporated into
rubber-base erasers or with another thermoplastic elastomer
to function as an eraser easy to be abraded.However, even when the breaking strength of the eraser as
a whole is lowered by the combination with the above-described
substance to abrade it by rubbing, the breaking
strength of the styrenic or olefinic thermoplastic elastomer
perse is not lowered. Therefore, erasers comprising the
styrenic or olefinic thermoplastic elastomer as the base
material have a problem that the erasing performance under a
weak rubbing force is far inferior to that of the polyvinyl
chloride eraser. US-A-4 578 420 discloses an eraser composition composed of conventional
fillers and additives wherein the binder is a styrene-butadiene-styrene block
polymer having a butadiene portion of 10 to 40 percent. In some cases, the
composition includes polybutadiene, aliphatic hydrocarbon and polynorbornene.
The polynorbornene is present in a relatively high proportion based on the
polybutadiene and/or aliphatic hydrocarbon.DE-A-3 005 298 discloses an eraser in which the base material is a styrene-isoprene-styrene
block copolymer. The composition may also include
polybutadiene,
