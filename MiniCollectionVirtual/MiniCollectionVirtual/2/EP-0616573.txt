<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a groove (205) of a precise width in a substrate (210). The groove may have any cross-sectional shape. The groove is formed by initially etching the substrate. The groove width (W) is then measured. The measured groove width is compared to the desired groove width (W2). Oxide is grown on the substrate in the region of the groove to adjust the width of the groove. The oxide may or may not be grown with the original etchant mask left on the substrate. Depending on whether it is desired to increase or decrease the groove width, the oxide is or is not removed. The process for increasing or decreasing groove width may be repeated any number of times as necessary to achieve a proper groove width. For many applications, the groove will be covered with a plate or other type of cap to define a channel as used in flow restrictors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of flow channels and
to the field of forming microminiature structures in an etchable
substrate material. In particular, it relates to the formation
of grooves in an etchable substrate material, the
grooves being capped to form a flow channel.US patent 4,256,514 describes a method for forming a narrow
dimensioned, for example, submicron, region on a silicon
body in an integrated circuit. A vertical walled trench is
formed and line with oxide. The oxide is removed only from the
bottom of the trench. A semiconductor region is then implanted
through the bottom of the trench.US patent 5,098,856 discloses a process for forming air-filled
isolation trenches in a semiconductor substrate which
serve as a dielectric isolation region in fabrication of semiconductor
devices.US-Patent 4542650 discloses a flow meter including
spaced webs deposited on a silicon substrate and fluid flow
grooves etched across a substrate surface and extending under
the spaced webs. A cover having etched grooves which matches
the grooves of the substrate forms a fluid passageway in which
the web bisects the passageway forming a bridge extending completely
across or cantilevered across in transverse relation
to the flat sides of the substrate on either side of the
groove. The grooves are sealed from each other.As shown in cross-section in Figure 1A, a flow channel can
be made by etching a groove 103 (often V-shaped) in a substrate
material 101 (typically silicon) and covering that
groove with a flat plate 102 (typically glass or silicon).
Often, a plurality of such grooves 103 are constructed in parallel
to form a flow restrictor. A cross-sectional view of
such a flow restrictor is shown in Figure 1B and a top view is
shown in Figure 1C. The top view shows clearly the restriction
of flow from the chamber 104 through the grooves 103.A covered V-shaped groove forms a flow channel with a triangular
cross-sectional shape. Flow through such a triangular
channel is a function of the fourth power of the effective diameter
of the groove. The effective diameter is approximately
equal to the diameter of the largest circle that can be inscribed
within the triangular cross-section of the channel.
Since the flow is so sensitive to the magnitude of 
the effective diameter, small changes in the width 105 of the
groove result in large differences in flow rate through the
groove for a given pressure drop. Thus, it is important to be
able to manufacture grooves so that the width of the groove
has a small tolerance.The

A method for forming a groove (205) in a substrate (210),

comprising:

forming a groove (205) in the substrate (210) extending
from a principal surface (201) of the substrate (210);
measuring a width of the groove (205);
comparing the width with a predetermined width to obtain a
