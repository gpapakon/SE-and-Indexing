<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed device comprises a container (1) intended to be placed in the vicinity of the source of said radiation and containing a medium (6) which has been subjected to prior irradiation and a metal salt or a combination of metal salts in said medium at a maximum concentration of 20 mg of salt(s) for 100 l of medium, said container being made of a non ferromagnetic material which is chemically neutral with respect to said medium and salt. Preferably, the salt is a salt of an alkaline metal or of an alkali earth metal, and the medium is an aqueous liquid medium.

<CLAIMS>
A device for providing protection against the
biological effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic

radiation, in particular the radiation emitted by
apparatuses having a display screen, the device being

characterized in that it comprises a receptacle (1)
designed to be placed in the proximity of the source of

said radiation, the receptacle containing a medium (6)
that has been subjected to prior non-ionizing irradiation

and that contains a metal salt or a combination of metal
salts at a maximum concentration of 20 mg of salt(s) per

100 liters of medium, said receptacle being made of a
material that is non-ferromagnetic and that is chemically

inert relative to said medium and to said salt.
The device of claim 1 in which said salt is a salt of
an alkali metal or of an alkaline-earth metal.
The device of claim 1, in which said medium is a
liquid medium.
The device of claim 3, in which said medium is an
aqueous medium.
The device of claim 1, in which said prior non-ionizing
irradiation of the medium is performed by using

a Lecher antenna (7) placed over a volume of said medium
and held in the hand (11) by one of its branches (8).
The device of claim 1, in which said prior non-ionizing
irradiation of the medium is performed by using

a source (13) of coherent radiation (12) associated with
means (14, 15) for co-operating with the hand (11) of an

operator. 
The device of claim 1, in which said receptacle is in
the form of at least one elongate tube that is closed at

both ends.
The device of claim 7, in which said receptacle is in
the form of two parallel tubes placed side by side.
The device of claim 7, in which the length of said
tube or said tubes lies in the range 10 cm to 25 cm.
