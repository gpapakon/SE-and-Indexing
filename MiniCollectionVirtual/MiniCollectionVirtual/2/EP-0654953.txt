<ABSTRACT>
An electroacoustic transducer arrangement for underwater antennas of a number of hydrophones (10) to be arranged vertically above one another at equal distances at a carrier is specified, in which, in order to simplify the assembly of the underwater antenna, and retaining good receiving characteristics, the hydrophones (10), together with a reflector (11) arranged behind them in the direction of sound incidence, are embedded in an acoustically transparent hard moulded surround (20) of an elastomer which can be processed in a moulding process, preferably polyurethane. The connecting lines (12) of the hydrophones (10) are combined on a common plug (13) which is accessible at one end face of the hard moulded surround (20). The hard moulded surround (20) is equipped with means (22) for mounting on the carrier.

Electroacoustic transducer arrangement for underwater
antennae comprising several hydrophones (10), which are

arranged at equal distance one vertically above the other
on a support (23), and which are provided with connection

lines (12) for electrical connection, characterised in that
the hydrophones (10) are embedded together with a reflector

(11) arranged behind them in the direction of sound
incidence in an acoustically transparent hard cast casing

(20) made of an elastomer which may be processed in the
casting process, preferably polyurethane (PUR), that the

connection lines (12) of the hydrophones (10) are joined to
form a common plug (13), which is accessible on the face

side of the hard cast casing (20), and that means for
fastening to the support (23) are provided on the hard cast

casing.
Transducer arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the reflector (11) has a sound-absorbent panel

(18), preferably made of polyurethane foam, extending
beyond all the hydrophones (10).
Transducer arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the sound-absorbent panel (18) forms the sound-absorbent

spring of a spring-earth system, the earth of
which is a metal bar (17), which abuts against the sound-absorbent

panel (18) on the front side thereof facing the
hydrophones (10).
Transducer arrangement according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the earth of the metal bar (17) and the sound-absorption

of the sound-absorbent panel (18) are attuned to
one another in such a manner that useful sound coming from

the front above a predetermined resonance frequency is
reflected onto the hydrophones (10) and disturbance sound 

coming from behind is shielded.
Transducer arrangement according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that the metal bar (17) is constructed in

a sandwich-type arrangement from two metal sheets (171,
172) with an interposed flexural wave-absorbing layer (19).
Transducer arrangement according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the flexural wave-absorbing layer (19) is a foil

which is glued to the two metal sheets (171, 172).
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that the metal bar (17) or metal sheets

(171, 172) is/are made of aluminium.
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that ceramic spheres are used as

hydrophones (10) which are fastened, preferably adhered, to
a spacer piece (21), preferably made of plastic, held in

precise position on the reflector (11) to maintain a
distance with exact tolerance from the reflector (11).
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the plug (13) protrudes into a blind

hole (14) formed in the hard cast casing (20) to receive a
counter plug (15) cooperating with the plug (13), and that

at least one radial hole (29) inserted from the outside of
the hard cast casting (20) opens on the base of the blind

hole (14).
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the hard cast casing (20) has a rod-like

shape with a rectangular or square cross-section.
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the means for fastening to the

support (23) have holes (22) passing through the hard cast
casing (20) and the reflector (11).
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 3 to 10
and Claim 11, characterised in that the hole section (221)

extending from the front side of the hard cast casing (20)
facing away from the support (23) as far as the metal bar

(17) of the reflector (11) has a substantially larger
diameter than the hole section (222) passing through the

metal bar (17).
Transducer arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised by its fastening to a cylindrical support

(23) made of glass fibre-reinforced plastic.
