<ABSTRACT>
An ear piercing assembly (20) includes a housing (70). First and 
second ear piercing earrings are releasably supported within the 

housing. A plunger assembly (60) is disposed within said housing and 
selectively ejects an ear piercing earring from the housing (70). The 

plunger assembly (60) is movable between a first position for ejecting 
the first ear piercing earring and a second position for ejecting 

the second ear piercing earring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an ear piercing assembly, 
and in particular, to a disposable ear piercing instrument having 
a displaceable plunger. Ear piercing systems are well-known in the art. For 
improved sterility and safety and to prevent cross contamination, 
disposable ear piercing instruments have been developed to minimize 
handling of clutches, ear piercing earrings, and ear piercing 
assemblies; removing sources of cross-contamination. A first 
disposable ear piercing apparatus utilizes a disposable cartridge 
containing the ear piercing earring and clutch. The stud and 
clutch are stored in the cartridge which may be removed from the 
ear piercing assembly for disposal after ear piercing. Such an ear 
piercing assembly is known from applicant's co-pending U.S Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/975,318. A second disposable ear 
piercing instrument is manufactured with the ear piercing stud and 
clutch already provided within the ear piercing instrument itself 
so that after a use, the entire ear piercing assembly is disposed. 
This apparatus is known from applicant's co-pending U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/936,936. In this apparatus the studs are 
contained within a housing mounted within the apparatus and a 
single push rod is moved behind the respective stud to eject the 
desired stud. Both of these prior art devices are satisfactory. 
However, both ear piercing assemblies require some form of 
cartridge assembly for housing the piercing stud or earring and the 
clutch resulting in a complex construction. Additionally, the 
device utilizing the disposable clutch cartridge makes use of a 
dual plunger assembly requiring complex alignment and a complex 
plunger structure. The entirely disposable ear piercing instrument 
is only capable of using ear piercing studs and therefore suffers 
from the additional disadvantage that ornamental earrings cannot 
be used as the ear piercing earring in the piercing process. 
Accordingly, a disposable ear piercing instrument which simplifies 
the construction while allowing the use of ear piercing earrings, 
overcoming the shortcomings of the prior art is desired.  Generally speaking, in accordance with the instant 
invention, a disposable ear piercing assembly is provided. A 
housing is formed with an anvil thereon to define a saddle region 
for receiving an earlobe between the anvil and the remainder of the 
housing. Two clutches in side by side relationship are secured 
within the anvil. A first capsule and a second capsule containing 
a

<CLAIMS>
An ear piercing assembly (20) comprising housing 
means (70), first and second ear piercing earrings (134) 

releasably supported within said housing means (70); 
plunger assembly means (60) disposed within said housing 

means (70) for selectively ejecting an ear piercing 
earring from said housing means, said plunger assembly 

means (60) being movable between a first position for 
ejecting a first ear piercing earring (134) from said 

housing means (70) and a second position for ejecting a 
second ear piercing (134) earring from said housing means 

(70). 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 1, wherein said 
plunger assembly means (60) includes a shaft (61) 

rotatably mounted within said housing means (70) and a 
dog legged push rod (63) extending from said shaft, said 

shaft 61 being rotatable to position said push rod in 
either one of said first and second positions. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 1, further 
comprising orientation means (64, 98) for selectively 

maintaining said plunger assembly means (60) oriented in 

either one of said first position or second position. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 3, wherein said 
plunger assembly means (60) includes a shaft (61) 

rotatably mounted within said housing means a dog legged 
push rod (63) extending from said shaft (61), said shaft 

being rotatable to position said push rod in one of said 
first and second positions and said orientation means 

including a plurality of slots (98, 100a, 100b) formed on 
said housing means and ribs (64, 65, 73, 77) extending 

along said shaft (61) and being dimensioned to be 
received by said slots, said slots cooperating with said 

ribs to prevent rotation of said shaft when said plunger 
assembly means is in one of said first position and 

second position. 
The ear piercing assembly of any preceding claim, 
further comprising indicator means (106) for indicating 

when said plunger assembly means (60) is in said first 
position and indicating when said plunger assembly means 

is in said second position. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 5, wherein said 
indicator means (106) has a color mark (110) on a portion 

thereof, said indicator means (106) being mounted on said 
plunger assembly means (60) to rotate therewith and said 

housing means (70) being formed with at least one window 
 

(102a, 102b), said indicator means (106) being movable to 
position said colored mark for viewing through said 

window. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 6 wherein said 
color mark (110) is provided on a dog legged push rod 

(63) of said plunger assembly means (60). 
The ear piercing assembly of any preceding claim, 
wherein said housing means (70) includes a first half 

(72a), a second half (72b) and a centerpiece (40), said 
centerpiece (40) cooperating with first half and said 

second half to form a first chamber (79) and a second 
chamber (80), a first ear piercing earring (134) being 

disposed within said first chamber and a second ear 
piercing earring (134) being disposed within said second 

chamber. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 8, further 
comprising capsule cartridge means (30) for maintaining 

an ear piercing earring (134) therein, said capsule 
cartridge means (30) being slidably disposed within said 

first chamber (79) to allow movement between a first 
position and a second position within said first chamber. 
The ear piercing assembly of claim 9, further 
comprising capsule cartridge orientation means (38a, 118) 

for orienting said capsule cartridge means (30) relative 
to a respective one of said chambers (79, 80).
