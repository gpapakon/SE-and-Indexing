<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shielding gas arc welding method for non-ferrous materials, in particular aluminium materials and aluminium alloys, for example AlSi, which method comprises the continuous supply, during welding operation, of a shielding gas containing argon and/or helium to the weld spot (welding point) adjacent to the electrode. According to the invention, a shielding gas is proposed which in addition to argon and/or helium comprises a carbon dioxide fraction or an oxygen fraction or a fraction of a mixture of these gases of from 0.01 to 0.7 % by volume, preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 % by volume (from 100 to 7000 or 1000 ppm, respectively).

Gas-shielded arc welding process for non-ferrous 
materials, in particular aluminium materials and aluminium 

alloys, in which a shielding-gas flow is continuously 
fed to the welding point, adjacent to the electrode, the 

shielding gas containing argon, helium or a mixture of 
these two gases, characterized in that, in addition to 

argon and/or helium, the shielding gas has a portion of 
carbon dioxide, oxygen, or carbon dioxide and oxygen, of 

0.01 to 0.1 % by volume (100 to 1000 ppm). 
Gas-shielded arc welding process according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the inert-gas portion of 

the shielding gas consists entirely of argon. 
Gas-shielded arc welding process according to 

Claim 1, characterized in that the shielding gas consists 
of 50 to 99.9 % by volume of argon and 0 to 50 % by 

volume of helium and, for the remainder, of carbon 
dioxide and/or oxygen. 
Arc welding process according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the shielding gas is prepared 

as a mixture ready for use. 
Gas-shielded arc welding process according to one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the shielding gas 

is mixed from the relevant components at the place of 
use. 
Gas-shielded arc welding process according to one 
of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that AlSi is used as 

the aluminium alloy. 
Shielding gas for the arc welding of non-ferrous 
materials, in particular aluminium materials and aluminium 

alloys, which contains argon and/or helium, characterized  
 

in that, in addition to argon and/or helium, the 
shielding gas contains a portion of carbon dioxide, 

oxygen, or carbon dioxide and oxygen, of 0.01 to 0.1 % by 
volume (100 to 1000 ppm).
