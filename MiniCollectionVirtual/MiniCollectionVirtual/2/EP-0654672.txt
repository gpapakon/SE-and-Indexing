<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit testing system (10) for testing small quantities of integrated 
circuit die. The testing system (10) includes an integrated circuit tester (15) and a base 

printed wiring board interface (11) that physically and electrically interfaces thereto. A 
die holder (12) that holds an integrated circuit die (16) is coupled to the base printed 

wiring board interface (11). A flexprint structure (13) comprising first and second 
flexible contact structures (13) is provided that electrically connect to the base printed 

wiring board interface (11), to pads (22) on the integrated circuit die (16), and to each 
other to provide for electrical connection between the tester (15) and the die (16). A 

plurality of alignment pins (14) are provided for aligning the first and second flexible 
contact structures (13) to each other and to the pads (2) on the integrated circuit die 

(16). The present invention is specifically designed for testing low quantities of small 
and large die (16), such as application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), without 

attaching the die to a substrate and wire bonding it for test purposes. The testing 
system (10) is versatile in that it can test a variety of pad patterns on the die (16). The 

system (10) is relatively low cost and has a low cost per operation. Furthermore, the 
system (10) provides for high test accuracy and good quality contact to the die (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit testing apparatus, and
more particularly, to integrated circuit testing apparatus that provides for testing of small
numbers of integrated circuit die in a cost-effective manner.Conventional techniques relating to integrated circuit testers include the use of apparatus
known as a microprobe, various methods involving die bonding or wire bonding the
die to test it and then removing the die with or without the attached wires, utilizing various
tab automated bonding (TAB) systems to wire bond the die to test it, and utilizing gate array
package into which a die is wired for testing and then removing the die from the gate array
package prior to the next assembly.In many of these conventional techniques, an inordinate amount of time is spent in
physically attaching wires to the die in order to test it. In many instances, the handling required
to wire the die for testing damages some of the integrated circuits. This makes some
of the integrated circuits unusable. In the case of specialized integrated circuits that are fabricated
in small quantities, such as for specialized military programs of for prototype circuits,
the high cost to manufacture such small quantities of circuits makes it imperative that
damage due to testing be minimized or eliminated. However, the conventional practices
have not achieved this. US-Patent 4 554 505 discloses integrated circuit testing system for testing small
quantities of integrated circuit die having the features of the preamble of claim 1. This
known testing system has as a wiring interface, a planar assembly of coaxial cables and,
as an integrated circuit die holder, a frame which aligns the integrated circuit die to be
tested with the respective contact element of each coaxial cable.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved integrated circuit
testing system for testing small quantities of integrated circuit die. The system in accordance
with the present invention is to provide improved testing capabilities without the
requirement of wiring of the die.This object in accordance with the present invention, is achieved by an integrated
circuit testing system having the features of claim one. Advantages and bodyments of
this testing system are subject matter of claims 2 to 4. Thus, the present invention provides an integrated circuit testing system for testing
small quantities of integrated circuit die. The integrated circuit testing system compromises
an integrated circuit tester and a base
