<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a clock whose casing, in order to achieve an unusual optical effect, is mounted on a spindle (3) about which it can rotate. The clock has at least one hand (2) which is rigidly fixed to the casing (2) or is formed by part of the casing (2). The clock also has a mechanism (10) which drives a clock-hand spindle (5) which is parallel to and staggered with respect to the casing spindle (3) and which is operatively linked to the casing hand (2) in such a way that the casing (2) rotates about its spindle (3) at the correct speed for its function as a clock hand. The time is read from the position of the hand with respect to the vertical lines forming the 12 o'clock/6 o'clock position.

Clock with at least one hand (2) mounted 
rotatably on a bearing axis (3) and with a clock 

mechanism (10) which drives a hand arbor (5) which 
is parallel and offset relative to the bearing 

axis (3) and to which the hand (2) is operatively 
connected,
 
characterized in that the hand (2) is connected 

rigidly to a housing (2) at least partially 
encapsulating the structure of the clock, or is 

formed by a portion of the housing so that the 
housing (2) rotates about the bearing axis (3) at 

the speed corresponding to its hand function, and 
in that the hand position can be read with 

reference to the vertical line constituting the 12 
o'clock/6 o'clock position. 
Clock according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the position of the centre of gravity of 

the clock structure as a whole is variable, and in 
that the bearing axis extends through the housing 

(2) in a manner such that, throughout the rotation 
of the housing (2), the centre of gravity of the 

clock structure as a whole preferably always lies 
slightly below the bearing axis (3), a driving 

mass which is movable relative to the housing (2)  
 

by means of the clock mechanism (10) and by means 
of which the position of the centre of gravity can 

be varied selectively being provided, if 
necessary. 
Clock according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the clock mechanism (10) is mounted 

rotatably relative to the housing (2), and in that 
the driving mass is formed by the clock mechanism 

(10). 
Clock according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that at least one further hand 

(4, 14) is provided, operatively connected to the 
hand arbor (5) and rotating about the axis of hand 

arbor (5). 
Clock according to any one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that a clock face (6) is 

provided, mounted with clearance on the hand arbor 
(5) and ballasted in a manner such that it is 

oriented automatically owing to gravity, and in 
that, if necessary, the clock face (6) is provided 

with an additional weight in the region of the 6 
o'clock position. 
Clock according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the clock face (6) is connected firmly to  

 
the clock mechanism (10) which is mounted 

rotatably relative to the housing (2), the clock 
mechanism (10) having a weight distribution such 

that it is oriented automatically owing to 
gravity. 
Clock according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the hand (4, 14) rotating 

about the axis of the hand arbor (5) is mounted in 

front of the housing (2). 
Clock according to any one of Claims 5 to 
7, characterized in that the clock face (6) is 

mounted in front of the housing (2), and/or in 
that the hand (4, 14) rotating about the axis of 

the hand arbor (5) is mounted in front of the 
clock face (6) and/or in that the clock face (6) 

is mounted in front of the hand (4, 14) rotating 
about the axis of the hand arbor (5). 
Clock according to any one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that it is made at least 

partially of transparent material. 
Clock according to any one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the housing (2) is formed 

asymmetrically relative to the bearing axis (3).
