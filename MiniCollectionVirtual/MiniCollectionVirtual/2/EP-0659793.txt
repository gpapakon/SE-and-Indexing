<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a one-liquid type
epoxy resin composition which can be stored for extended
periods of time at ordinary temperature and cures
quickly upon heating.Epoxy resins of the two-liquid type have heretofore
been used being comprised of an epoxy resin and a curing
agent. The epoxy resin composition of the two-liquid
type, however, require such operations as weighing,
stirring and mixing at a time when they are used on the
site. These operations involve such problems as a
decreased operation efficiency, erroneous weighing, or
disposal of excess amounts of the epoxy resin
composition. At present, therefore, study has been
extensively conducted in an effort to developing one-liquid
type epoxy resin compositions that permit highly
efficient workability on the site and can be stored for
extended periods of time to substitute for the two-liquid
type ones.Development of a latent epoxy curing agent is a
prerequisite for preparing the one-liquid type epoxy
resin compositions. Known examples of the latent epoxy
curing agent include dicyandiamide, carboxylic acid
hydrazide, guanamine compounds, imidazole compounds.
However, these latent curing agents cure the composition
by heating at relatively high temperatures for extended
periods of time. It has therefore been urged to provide
a curing agent that activates at a low temperature and
exhibits an excellent latent property.As latent curing agents for curing epoxy resins at 
relatively low temperatures, there is known an adduct of
an alkylamine and an epoxy resin, and an adduct of an
imidazole compound and an epoxy resin (U.S. Patent No.
4,066,625). These adducts however, are insufficient alone
to obtain satisfactory latency. Therefore, additional
modifications have been reported in which the surfaces
thereof are coated with various compounds. For instance,
there has been reported a method of encapsulation with an
isocyanate compound (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 268723/1986) and a method of surface treatment using
an acidic substance (Japanese Patent Publication No.
18326/1990, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
223027/1988).However, a satisfactory degree of latency has not
been reliably achieved by the above-mentioned attempts to
import latency by surface treatment. For instance, the
capsule film of the isocyanate compound is easily
destroyed by mechanical impact but is not sufficiently
regenerated. In addition, surface treatment with an
acidic compound such as an organic acid, an inorganic
acid, a resin acid or an
