<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, an 
ultrasonic probe for use with a remote ultrasonic 

imaging system is provided, having a multielement 
transducer (60) with an upper surface and a lower surface. 

An ultrasonically attenuative backing material (66) adjoins 
the lower surface of the multielement transducer. The 

attenuative backing material is disposed within a 
container (64). A circular track (68) is mounted to the 

container, and a flexible assembly (42) and a carrier band (120) 
are attached to the container. The carrier band may be 

operable to rotate the multielement transducer about an 
axis (48) defined by the circular track. Alternatively, the 

circular track may be operable to rotate the 
multielement transducer. Additionally, a method of 

forming near real-time images of an object in a plane 
that is oblique to the axis of rotation of the 

multielement transducer is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to ultrasonic imaging 
systems, and more particularly to systems that utilize 
a transducer probe to send ultrasonic signals to a 
remote ultrasonic imaging system. The users of medical ultrasound transducer 
probes, hereinafter referred to as sonographers, can 
access bodily regions to be imaged via their free hand 
physical manipulation, rotation, sliding and tilting of 
the transducer probe. One area in particular where 
this manipulation is more challenging is 
transesophageal cardiac imaging. During 
transesophageal cardiac imaging, the sonographer 
orients a scanhead at the tip of the transducer probe 
in the esophagus or stomach of a patient in order to 
obtain different fields of view of the heart. To 
obtain the desired views of the heart, the sonographer 
may have to slide, twist or curl the transducer probe 
in order to properly position the scanhead, which 
contains the imaging transducer(s). For this application, it has been found 
desirable to rotate the transducer contained in the 
scanhead independently from the scanhead itself. In 
combination with the ability to slide, twist or curl 
the scanhead, the ability to independently rotate the 
transducer(s) while the scanhead is stationary gives 
the sonographer the ability to obtain an ultrasonic  
 
image of any image plane orthogonal to and intersecting 
the face of the transducer(s) at each location to which 
the scanhead can be moved. By giving the sonographer 
the ability to remotely rotationally orient the 
acoustic device in the scanhead to obtain different 
image slices of the heart or its valves, for example, 
patient comfort is increased. Further, the time 
required for an ultrasonic examination may be reduced. Devices are known that incorporate a remotely 
rotationally adjustable transducer. For example, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,543,960 to Harui et al. discloses a 
transesophageal echo cardiography scanhead. The 
elements of the transducer are mounted upon a rotatable 
base, which is connected by a shaft to a pulley below 
the transducer. A control cable is directed into the 
scanhead and is attached to the pulley. The elements 
of the transducer are electrically connected to a wire 
bundle by flexible PCB interconnects. The control 
cable is guided, through a pair of guide tubes, out of 
the scanhead so that the operator can control the 
angular relationship of the transducer with respect to 
the housing. A disadvantage of the Harui device is that 
the pulley, shaft and flexible PCB interconnects 
require a
