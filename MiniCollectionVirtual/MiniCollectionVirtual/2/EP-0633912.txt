<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the radiation curing of polymerizable
coatings, such as is commercially practiced on many types of substrates.
Radiation curing speeds up the application of coatings and generally
requires the use of photoinitiators.There are two principal types of such photoinitiators, cationic
and free radical, which are selected depending upon the species of
polymerizable materials used. For example, cationic photoinitiators are
required by vinyl ethers and epoxy compounds, while free radical
photoinitiators are employed with acrylates. When free radical
photoinitiators are used, it is generally preferred to carry out the
polymerization in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen. Otherwise, the
polymerization reaction is slowed by the presence of oxygen. Materials
which are radiation cured with cationic photoinitiators need not avoid air
and thus have an advantage over materials which require an inert
atmosphere to be most efficiently cured.In the past, where both types of polymerizable compounds
have been used together, both types of photoinitiators have been
included. For example, in U.S. Patent 4,156,035 mixtures of epoxy resins
and acrylates are shown to be cured by radiation in the presence of both
cationic and free radical photoinitiators. Dougherty and Vara in Rad Tech
90, North America, Conference Proceedings, confirmed this and reported
on their experiments with mixtures of acrylates and vinyl ethers in which
they employed both types of photoinitiators. They found that the use of
cationic photoinitiators alone gave inferior results compared to mixtures
of both types. More importantly, they found that free radical initiators
failed to provide sufficient curing when both acrylates and vinyl ethers
were present. In U.S. Patent 4,999,216 the patentees reported on a
formulation which employed only free radical initiators with mixtures of
vinyl ethers and maleate or fumarate esters which are known in the art to
copolymerize. The coating formulation was intended for use on concrete
floors and, as the patentees pointed out, cationic photoinitiators could not
be used on a basic substrate since they involve the release of acid
compounds. The assignee of the '216 patent stated in PCT/US90/01243
that vinyl ethers do not homopolymerize in the presence of free radical
initiators and that they are therefore not replacements for (meth)acrylates.Many of the radiation cured coatings in commercial use
today include acrylate compounds and these are often blended with
undesirable reactive diluents, such as
