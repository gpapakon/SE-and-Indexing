<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic apparatus capable of forming 
image of excellent quality by using a photosensitive drum 

of a small diameter. The photosensitive drum has a small 
outer diameter drum having a circumferential length 

shorter than 1/2 of the image size in the drum rotating 
direction, the photosensitive drum and the image-forming 

cycle are so related to each other that a piece of image 
is formed after the drum is revolved many times, and the 

amount of discharge is so set that in forming a piece of 
image, the residual potential is 10% or less of the 

charged surface potential after the discharge of the first 
time of revolution, and an increase in the residual 

potential is not more than 30% after the discharge of the 

last time of revolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic apparatus
preferably one
using an organic
single-layer photosensitive drum. More specifically, the
invention relates to an electrophotographic apparatus
which is capable of forming an image of excellent quality
by using a photosensitive drum of a small diameter.Photosensitive materials which are commercially used
for the electrophotography include selenium photosensitive
materials, amorphous silicon (a-Si) photosensitive
materials, and organic photosensitive materials. Among
them, the organic photosensitive materials are widely used
for the applications of personal copiers and the like from
the overall standpoint of sensitivity, cost, etc.The organic photosensitive materials are, in many
cases, of the so-called function separation type, i.e.,
the laminated type in which a charge generating layer
(CGL) and a charge transporting layer (CTL) are laminated
one upon the other. There has further been used an
organic photosensitive material of the single-layer
dispersion type in which the charge generating substance
is dispersed in the charge-transporting medium.The size of the electrophotographic apparatus can be
effectively decreased by decreasing the volume occupied by
the photosensitive drum, i.e., by decreasing the size of
the drum. When the diameter of the drum is decreased,
however, a copy image is formed by revolving the drum
many times; i.e., the steps of uniform charging, exposure
to image, developing, transfer, cleaning and discharging which are
necessary for forming the image must be carried out for
many times of revolutions of the drum. It has, however, been found that when a copy image is formed by revolving
the organic single-layer photosensitive drum many times, the image density decreases
in a stepwise manner depending upon the number of revolutions of the drum.Though the degree of stepwise decrease in the image density is small, a change
in the density on a copy can be clearly discerned even with the naked eye. This
change appears considerably more clearly on the solid portion of the image, and it is
desirable to solve this problem.When the image-forming cycle is repeated many times, for the above-mentioned
organic single-layer photosensitive drum, and the a-Si photosensitive
material in particular, the surface potential at the developing portion decreases
considerably due to dark attenuation resulting in a great decrease in the image density.The object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide an
electrophotographic apparatus
