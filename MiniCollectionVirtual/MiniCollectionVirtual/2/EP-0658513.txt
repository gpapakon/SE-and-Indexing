<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing modified SiO2 gels, known as "xerogels", and also to the xerogels thus prepared themselves and their use. The xerogels are prepared by acidifying an aqueous waterglass solution, polymerising the silicic acid thus formed by addition of a base to give an SiO2 gel, substantially washing the water from the gel using an organic solvent, reacting the gel with a silylation agent and then drying it at from -30 to 200 DEG C and at from 0.001 to 20 bar.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing xerogels, wherein

a) an aqueous waterglass solution is brought
to a pH of ≤ 2.2 with the aid of an acid

ion-exchange resin or of a mineral acid,
b) the resultant silica is polymerized to
give an SiO
2
 gel by adding a base and, if a
mineral acid has been used in step a), the

gel is washed with water until free from
electrolytes,
c) the SiO
2
 gel obtained in step b) is allowed
to age at from 20 to 90°C and at a pH of

from 6 to 11 for from 1 to 48 hours,
d) the gel obtained in step c) is washed with
an organic solvent until the water content

of the gel is ≤ 5% by weight,
e) the gel obtained in step d) is reacted
with a silylating agent, and
f) the silylated gel obtained in step e) is
dried at from -30 to 200°C and from 0.001

to 20 bar.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein an acid
ion-exchange resin is used in step a).
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
base used in step b) is NH
4
OH, NaOH, KOH, Al(OH)
3

or colloidal silica.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the pH in step c) is from 6 to 9.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the duration of the aging in step c) is

from 1 to 24 hours.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein, in step d), the gel is washed until its

water content is ≤ 2% by weight.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein, in step d), the organic solvent used is

methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl
acetate, dioxane, n-hexane or toluene.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein, in step e), the silylating agent used is

mono-, di- or trimethylchlorosilane, trimethylmethoxysilane
or hexamethyldisilazane.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein the silylated gel obtained in step e) is

washed with a protic or aprotic solvent before
being dried in step e).
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9,
wherein, in step f), the silylated gel is dried at

from 0 to 100°C. 
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein, in step f), the silylated gel is dried at

from 0.01 to 5 bar.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein, in step f), the silylated gel is dried at

from 0.1 to 2 bar.
