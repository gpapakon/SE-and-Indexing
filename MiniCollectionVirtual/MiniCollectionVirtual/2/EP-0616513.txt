<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article for
preparing a bone to receive a distal implant, said device
comprising a base having a longitudinal axis, mounting means
for mounting said base on the bone aligning said longitudinal
axis of said base parallel with a long axis of the bone,
single point connecting means for connecting a plurality of
bone preparing devices to said base at a single point
reference. Such an article is known from US-A-4,474,177.Many surgical procedures have been developed involving
the replacement of a knee joint with a prosthesis. Examples
of such procedures are disclosed in the R.M.C.™ Total Knee
System technical manual published by Richards Manufacturing
Company, Inc. of Memphis, TN and the Surgical Procedure for
the Whiteside Ortholoc® Modular Knee System Manual, published
by the assignee of the present application. Each of the
surgical protocols details the steps of exposing the knee
joint and then preparing the distal demur and proximal tibia
to enable the implantation of the prosthesis.The alignment of the total knee components is an
essential step in the performance of the total knee
replacement arthroplasty. The article of R.S. Laskin,
Orthopedics, January 1984, Vol. 7 No. 1, pp. 36-46, details
various alignment systems, and an indepth discussion of the
orientation of the knee joint and the criticality of the
prosthesis reflecting an accurate varus or valgus angle for
proper prosthesis placement.Various instruments have been used to assist in
alignment of the various distal cuts and anterior/posterior
cuts made during the preparatory steps discussed above. For 
example, US-A-4,474,177, mentioned above, discloses a method
and apparatus for shaping a distal femoral surface. The
patent discussed a femoral surface modifying instrument in
the form of a distal femoral condyle cutting guide. US-A-4,487,203
discloses a single guide member for use in
resecting the distal femoral condyles, the proximal tibia,
and the distal femur. The surgical procedure entitled "Knee
Replacement Using the Insall/Burstein Total Congular Knee
System, issued by the New York Society for the Relief of the
Ruptured and Crippled Children, Zimmer Orthopedics, Warsaw,
IN, discloses an operative procedure utilizing a spacer guide
and a further cutter alignment instrument.Each of the above patent and protocol provide
alignment instruments which do not have the capability of
axially and angularly aligning all preparatory instruments
based on a single point which could thereby totally
coordinate all
