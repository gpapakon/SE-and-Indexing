<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to conditioning shampoos
which have a dispersed, non-volatile silicone phase and are
stabilized through the use of certain long chain materials.Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the
surrounding atmosphere and, to a greater extent, from sebum
secreted by the head. The build-up of the sebum causes the
hair to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The
soiling of the hair necessitates it being shampooed with frequent
regularity.Shampooing the hair cleans by removing excess soil and
sebum. However, the shampooing process has disadvantages in
that the hair is left in a wet, tangled and generally unmanageable
state. A variety of approaches have been developed to alleviate
the after-shampoo problems. These range from the inclusion of
hair conditioning aids in shampoos to post-shampoo application of
hair conditioners, i.e., hair rinses. Hair rinses typically work
by depositing a polymeric film or other material onto the hair.
However, such solutions to a very prevalent problem have not
been fully satisfactory. For one thing, hair rinses are generally
liquid in nature and must be applied in a separate step following
the shampooing, left on the hair for a length of time, and rinsed
with fresh water. This, of course, is time consuming and is not
convenient.While shampoos have been disclosed which contain conditioning
aids, they have not been totally satisfactory for a variety of
reasons. One problem relates to compatibility problems between
good cleaning anionic surfactants and the fatty cationic agents
which are good conditioning agents. This caused other
surfactants such as nonionics, amphoterics and zwitterionics to be
examined by workers in the field. Many of these efforts are
reflected in patents issued in the conditioning shampoo area. See
for example U.S. Patent 3,849,348, November 19, 1974 to Hewitt; The use of these other surfactants solved many of the
compatibility problems but still did not provide complete answers
in all areas. For instance cationic conditioners may not deliver
the desired level of softness desired by users. Materials which
can provide increased softness are silicones, both those which are
soluble as well as insoluble in the shampoo matrix.Silicones in shampoo compositions have been disclosed in a
number of different publications. Such publications include U.S.
Patent 2,826,551, March 11, 1958 to Geen; U.S. Patent
3,964,500, June 22, 1976 to Drakoff; U.S. Patent 4,364,837,
December 21, 1982 to Pader; and British Patent

<CLAIMS>
Use of a long chain acyl derivative as a suspending agent in a
shampoo composition, the shampoo composition comprising


(a) from 5 to 70% by weight of a synthetic surfactant;
(b) from 0.01% to 10% by weight of a dispersed, insoluble, non-volatile
silicone;
(c) from 0.5% to 5% by weight of suspending agent; and
(d) water;

and wherein the suspending agent is a mixture of suspending agents
which serve to assist in suspending the silicone and which comprises

a long chain acyl derivative present in the shampoo composition in
the form of crystals.
Use according to Claim 1 wherein the surfactant is selected from
anionic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants

and mixtures thereof.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the long chain acyl derivative
is selected from ethylene glycol stearates, alkanol amides of fatty

acids having from 16 to 22 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof.
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the non-volatile
silicone is selected from polydimethylsiloxanes having viscosities of

from 5 to 100,000mm
2
.s
-1
 (centistokes) at 25°C and polypropylene
oxide modified dimethylsiloxanes.
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the shampoo
composition additionally contains a quaternary ammonium

compound.
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 5 wherein the surfactant is a
betaine.
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the acyl derivative is
ethylene glycol distearate. 
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 7 wherein the shampoo
composition has a pH of from 2 to 4.
Use according to any of Claims 1 to 8 wherein the acyl derivative
has an average particle size in the shampoo compositions of about
