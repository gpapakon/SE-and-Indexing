<ABSTRACT>
A cyclopropane derivative represented by the general 
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has 

antiviral activity and is suitable for inclusion in antiviral 
medicaments: 


wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a group represented by the 

formula (1): 

(in which R³ represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 6 
carbon atoms), provided that at least one of R¹ and R² is not 

a hydrogen atom; X represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl 
group, an amino group, or a halogen atom; and Y represents a 

hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, or an amino group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cyclopropane
derivatives having an antiviral activity which are useful as
an agent for treating various viral diseases, and also
relates to an antiviral agent containing the same.Many nucleic acid derivatives have antiviral activity,
and acyclovir, ganciclovir, azidothymidine, etc. have been
practically used as an antiviral agent. However, these
nucleic acid derivatives have problems since they generally
have poor solubility in water. For example, in order to use
as an injection, these compounds should be dissolved in a
large amount of water and administered by the intravenous
drip. Moreover, these compounds can hardly be used as an
ophthalmic solution.Japanese patent application JP-A-59/10587 discloses
amino acid esters of acyclovir, particularly, glycine or
alanine esters of acyclovir, as a compound having an improved
solubility in water as compared with acyclovir. Unexamined
published Japanese patent application No. 64-68373 discloses
that valine and isoleucine esters of acyclovir have better
bioavailability (oral absorbability) after oral
administration in comparison with the glycine and alanine
esters.Japanese patent application JP-A-2/218667 discloses
amino acid esters of ganciclovir, but does not include oral
absorbability data. Accordingly, it is not clear what type
of amino acid esters could improve oral absorbability. On the other hand, Japanese patent application JP-A-5/78357
discloses that the compound represented by the
following general formula (II) has potent antiviral activity.

wherein X represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an
amino group, or a halogen atom; and Y represents a hydrogen
atom, a hydroxyl group, or an amino group.However, similar to the known nucleic acid derivatives,
this compound also has low solubility in water and has
problems such as poor oral absorbability and poor transdermal
permeability.The present inventors have conducted extensive studies
on the compound represented by the general formula (II) above
to improve solubility in water and oral absorbability and, as
a result, found that the oral absorbability may be improved
and the treatment effect enhanced by esterifying the hydroxyl
group of this compound with certain amino acids.Thus, the present invention relates to a cyclopropane
derivative represented by the general formula (I): 

wherein R1 and R2, both
represent a group represented by the
formula (1):

in which X represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl
group, an amino group, or a halogen atom; and Y represents a
hydroge
