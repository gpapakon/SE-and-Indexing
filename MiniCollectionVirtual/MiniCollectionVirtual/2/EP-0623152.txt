<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymerizable compositions comprising an 
energy-polymerizable catalyst system, and cured adhesive films, pressure 
sensitive adhesives, protective coatings, liquid adhesives, structural and semi-structural 
adhesives, and free-standing films prepared therewith. Various polymeric coatings and articles are produced in processes 
involving the use of organic solvents. There is an intense effort by researchers 
and industry to promote high and 100% solids formulations and processes to 
reduce or eliminate the use of such solvents and the attendant costs and 
environmental contamination. Radiation dual curable compositions containing unsaturated monomers 
and epoxy monomers have been described in a number of U.S. Patents Nos. 
4,156,035 (Tsao et al.), 4,227,978 (Barton), 4,428,807 (Lee et al.), 
4,623,676 (Kistner), 4,657,779 (Gaske), and 4,694,029 (Land). Compositions 
described in the aforementioned patents include onium salts combined with 
organic compounds as the curing system. U.S. Patent No. 4,717,605 (Urban et al.) describes radiation curable 
adhesives based on the combination of an epoxide system and ionic 
photoinitiators of the triarylsulfonium complex type and at least one 
ethylenically unsaturated substance that can be polymerized by free radicals 
and at least one free radical photoinitiator. The adhesive described is a 
hardenable glue cured by two light exposures. U.S. Patent No. 4,677,137 (Bany et al.) describes a process using a 
supported onium salt or an ionic salt of an organometallic complex as the  
 
photoinitiator system for the polymerization of cationically polymerizable 
materials. U.S. Patent No. 4,707,432 (Gatechair et al.) describes a free radically 
polymerizable composition comprising a free radically polymerizable material 
and a photoinitiator system comprising an alpha-cleavage or homolytic bond 
cleavage photoinitiator and a ferrocenium salt. WO 8802879 (Woods et al.) describes a free radically polymerizable 
composition comprising a free radically polymerizable material and a 
photoinitiator system comprising a free radical photoinitiator and a 
ferrocenium salt. Furthermore, the composition may contain one or more 
cationically polymerizable materials. U.S. Patent No. 4,849,320 (Irving et al.) describes a process using a 
combination of two different photoinitiators and two different polymerizable 
monomers in combination with irradiation at two substantially different 
wavelengths. U.S. Patent No. 4,751,138 (Tumey et al.) describes a coated
