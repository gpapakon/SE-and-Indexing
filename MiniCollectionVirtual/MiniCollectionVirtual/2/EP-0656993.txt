<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an air-aspiration (1) for an internal-combustion engine, in which the aspirator manifold includes an enclosure (2), the aspiration system having at the air-inflow end an inlet pipe and at the output end several separate suction pipes (4, 5, 6, 7) which pass into the cylinder head and are connected to the individual cylinders of the engine. The inlet pipe (3) has an air-directing device (8) which extends approximately down as far as the plane running between the two middle suction pipes (5, 6), the air-directing device (8) having a wall facing the mouths of the suction pipes and which is located at a certain distance from the mouths of the suction pipes.

<CLAIMS>
An intake unit for an internal-combustion engine, with a suction distributor comprising 
a container and having an intake socket (3) at the inflow end and a plurality of individual 

intake pipes (4, 5, 6, 7) at the outflow end, the intake pipes (4, 5, 6, 7) opening 
into a cylinder head of the internal-combustion engine and being connected to the individual 

cylinders, 
characterized in that
 the intake socket (3) comprises an air-guiding 
device (8) extending transversely to the inner openings of the individual intake pipes (6, 

7) substantially as far as a plane (
X-X
) which extends between the two middle individual 
intake pipes (5, 6) interposed between the outer individual intake pipes (4 and 7) 

and which extends in the axial direction of the individual intake pipes (4, 5), wherein 
the inner openings of the individual intake pipes (4, 5, 6, 7) are arranged on the same 

side with respect to the intake socket (3), and a wall (9) of the air-guiding device (8) 
facing the inner openings (6a, 7a) of the intake pipes (6, 7) is arranged at a distance 

from the said openings (6a, 7a). 
An intake unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the air-guiding device (8) 
comprises a cylindrical air-guiding member forming together with the intake socket (3) 

of the suction distributor (1) a cast one-piece component, the outer wall (2a) of which 
[extends]
 from the container (2) and the inner wall (9) of which is arranged free in the 
interior (10) of the container. 
An intake unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the air-guiding device (8a) 
comprises a plastics tube (11) connected to the intake socket (3) by way of a fastening 

means (12) for securing it axially and held with a cylindrical portion fitted in the pipe 
socket (3) and projecting into the interior (10) freely towards the container wall with its 

end remote from the said portion. 
An intake unit according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the fastening means (12) 
comprises a spring ring (13) engaging in an annular groove (14) in the tube (11) 

arranged corresponding to an annular channel (15) in the intake socket (3). 
An intake unit according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the plastics tube (11) 
has a thickening of material in the region of the receiving means of the spring ring (13) 

in the annular groove (14), the thickening of material being deformable by the spring 
ring (13) in a radially expanding manner in the heated state of the tube (11) and resting  

 
in the base of the annular channel (15). 
An intake unit according to Claim 3 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the pipe portion (
A
) 
fitted in the intake socket (3) has a rotation-preventing means (15a, 23) which comprises 

a pressed-out portion (23) extending in the axial direction of the tube (11) and 
arranged in an axial groove (15a) in the intake socket (3). 
An intake unit according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the fitted pipe portion (
A
) 
has a tapered entry part (20) with an adjoining annular groove (22) which is widened 

towards the outside and intersects a pressed-out portion (23) extending in the axial 
direction of the pipe and arranged in a manner corresponding to the axial groove (15a) 

in the intake socket (3).
