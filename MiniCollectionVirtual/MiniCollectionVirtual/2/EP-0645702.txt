<ABSTRACT>
Load balancing method in a multiprocessor system, particularly a multiprocessor system of a communication system, in which tasks which occur can be processed by several processors in real-time conditions. If individual processors become overloaded because of local heavy load situations, the way in which the local overload is relieved is that in this load situation further incoming demands for the processor are passed to other processors which are not overloaded, as far as possible/necessary.

Method for load equalization in a
multiprocessor system, in particular a multiprocessor

system for a communication system (K), in which jobs
that occur can be processed by a plurality of

processors (GPn) in real-time conditions,

having the following method steps:

each processor (GPi) determines its load state
(GPLSi) in the form of a quantified variable,
the load states (GPLSn) of the other processors
(GPn) are reported to each processor (GPi) within a

time pattern,
depending on whether its load state (GPLSi)
exceeds a specific level and depending on the load

states of the other processors (GPn), each processor
(GPi) transfers at least a portion of the jobs that

arrive at it to the other processors (GPn),
the transferred jobs are distributed between the
other processors (GPn), depending on the load states

(GPLSn) of the other processors (GPn).
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that a processor (GPi) transfers only sufficient
jobs that its load state (GPLS) once again falls below

the said specific level.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized
 
in that the quantified variables which characterize the

load states are each provided with a hysteresis value
at both their upper and lower range boundaries.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that, when jobs are transferred from one processor
(GPi) to the other processors (GPn), a measure for

defending the processor (GPi) against jobs is also
determined.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the processor-related load states (GPLSn) are
distributed by means of "each-informs-each"

communication by the individual control managers of the
processors (GPn) directly to all the other control

managers of the processors (GPn) in the communication
system (K).
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the processor-related load states (GPLSn) are
combined in the load control manager (LOCM) of a

specific processor (GPx).
Method according to Claim 6,

characterized

in that the load states (GPLSn) combined in the
specific processor (GPx) are each stored in tables in

the processors (GPn) in accordance with a time pattern.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized

in that the proportion (pi(n)) of the jobs which can
still additionally be processed by the processors is

defined as a function of the respective load state
(GPLS) of the said processors.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized
 
in that the jobs (q(j)) which can be distributed away

from a processor are added to or subtracted from as a
function of the respective load state (GPLSn) of the

said processors (GPi).
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized

in that the proportion of the jobs (g(j)) which can be
distributed away from a given processor is determined

in each processor, in the event of an overload, as a
function of the result of the sum of the proportions

(p(i)) of the jobs which can additionally be carried
out by the other processors.
