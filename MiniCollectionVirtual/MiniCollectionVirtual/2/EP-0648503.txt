<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to the field of substrate-spacer-prodrug compounds
(pro-prodrugs) suited for site specific delivery of drugs, a process of
preparing them and their use.A prodrug may be defined as a chemical which is non-toxic and pharmacodynamically
inert, but which can be transformed in vivo to a pharmacologically
active drug.Prodrug transformation can be obtained in vivo using site specifically
located enzymes (WO 92/19639), systemically available enzymes
(Etoposide phosphate, Ref.: 10th International Congress of
Chemotherapy, June 27 - July 2, 1993, Abstract Nr. 692), endogenous
intracelluar lysosomal proteolytic enzymes (Duncan R., Anti-Cancer Drugs
3, 175-210, 1992) or sequential action of two endogenous "tumor site
specific" enzymes (WO 93/08688). This enzyme mediated transformation
is most effective with respect to pharmacological efficacy, - if the prodrug
is highly detoxified compared to the drug -, can be selectively
activated at the target site, and has an extended plasma half-life.
Detoxification is optimally obtained, if the hydrophilicity of the prodrug is
significantly higher than that of the drug combined with a suitable plasma
stability of the prodrug. Prodrug transformation is optimally obtained, if the
prodrug can be target site specifically cleaved with high activation rate
(Vmax/Km). In addition, plasma half life of prodrugs can be extended by
linking to hydrophilic high molecular weight copolymers (Duncan, R., Anti-Cancer
Drugs 3, 175-210, 1992). The prodrugs reported in the literature do not fulfill the criteria for optimal
site specific prodrug activation.Now, new pro-prodrugs with exceptional pharmacological efficacy could
be synthesized harbouring all the favourable parameters mentioned
above. These pro-prodrugs need activation by at least two different
enzymes, one of them located accessible only at the target site, the other
one located systemically or in a different compartement/site.One of the enzymes can be an endogenous enzyme located in the plasma
(i.e. esterases, preferentially phosphatases, etc.), the second enzyme
could be an endogenous intracellular, preferentially a lysosomal enzyme
(i.e. proteases, glycosidases, preferentially glucuronidases, etc.)
accessible only at the target site or a targeted enzyme. Targeting
preferentially can be obtained using an appropriate fusion protein (EP-A
0501215) or an antibody-enzyme conjugate (WO 88/07378).Furthermore, pro-prodrug activation can be performed by independent or
sequential action of the two enzymes. Independent
