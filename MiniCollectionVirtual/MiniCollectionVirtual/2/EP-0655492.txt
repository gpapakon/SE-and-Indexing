<ABSTRACT>
A hydrocarbon stream is cracked in Plant A to produce a hot gaseous stream 
which is separated in a fractionator B. A gaseous stream containing hydrogen 

and C₁-C₄ hydrocarbons is taken from the fractionator B, is raised in pressure in 
compressor C and is cooled in a heat exchanger D. The cooled gaseous stream 

is separated in a demethaniser E, and an off-gas comprising hydrogen and C₁ to 
C₃ hydrocarbons is withdrawn from the demethaniser E. The off-gas is 

subjected to separation by pressure swing adsorption or temperature swing 
adsorption at an adsorption temperature of about 0 to about 250°C in a bed of 

adsorbent which selectively adsorbs ethylene and propylene, thereby adsorbing 
substantially all of the ethylene and propylene from the gas stream. The 

ethylene and/or propylene is recovered upon bed regeneration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the cracking of hydrocarbons and more particularly to the
recovery of olefins from the off-gas from a catalytic cracking operation.The effluent from a hydrocarbon cracking unit contains a wide spectrum of
hydrocarbons. To recover the hydrocarbons the effluent is cooled and subjected to
a series of separation steps, such as condensation and distillation to recover the
heavy and light liquid components. After removal of these components, the
remaining light gas stream can be compressed and cooled, thereby condensing
most of the remaining hydrocarbons from the stream. The noncondensable gas
remaining after the light gas compression and condensation step, generally referred
to as off-gas, is composed substantially of hydrogen and small amounts of C1 to C3
hydrocarbons, and perhaps some other gaseous components, such as nitrogen and
carbon dioxide. The off-gas is usually sent to flare or used as fuel. To minimize the
amount of hydrocarbons remaining in the off-gas, the light gas stream is
compressed to as high a pressure and cooled to as low a temperature as is
practicable. Consequently, the energy expended in cooling and compressing the
condensable light gases is considerable.It is desirable to reduce the overall cost of recovering cracked hydrocarbon products
and maximize the amount of valuable C2 and C3 alkenes recovered from the
hydrocarbon cracking unit off-gas. This objective could be attained if an efficient
and cost effective method of recovering lower alkenes from gas streams were
available. The present invention provides an alkene adsorption method which
reduces the energy requirements of hydrocarbon cracking processes and provides
substantially complete recovery of the lower alkenes contained in cracking unit off-gas.According to the invention, a process for the recovery of alkene selected from
ethylene, propylene and mixtures of these from a cracked hydrocarbon stream
comprising the steps:
(a) separating a gaseous stream from the cracked hydrocarbon product;(b) cooling the gaseous stream, thereby producing a condensed hydrocarbon
stream and a gas stream comprising hydrogen and methane and containing
amounts of alkene and alkane, the alkane being selected from ethane,
propane and mixtures of these; (c) subjecting said gas stream to a cyclic adsorption process in a bed of
adsorbent which selectively adsorbs alkenes, thereby producing a
nonadsorbed hydrogen- and alkane-enriched component and an adsorbed
alkene-enriched component; and(d) desorbing said alkene-enriched
