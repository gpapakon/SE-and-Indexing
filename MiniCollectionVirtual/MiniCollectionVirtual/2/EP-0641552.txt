<ABSTRACT>
A shorts type disposable diaper (1) comprising a body (10) 
having a liquid permeable topsheet (11), a liquid impermeable 

backsheet (12), and an absorbent member interposed between said 
topsheet and said backsheet, characterized in that;

 
   said body has a pair of first expansive side panels (20), 

and a pair of second expansive side panels (20),
 

   said first expansible side panels of the stomach-side 
portion are affixed to said second expansible side 

panels of the back-side portion to thereby define a waist 
opening portion (15), a pair of leg opening portions (17,17') and a 

body-surrounding portion (E) located around the wearer's body 
when the diaper is worn;

 
   elastic members (21,21' and 23,23') are arranged on an area 

adjacent to said waist opening portion and on said body-surrounding 
portion in said stomach-side and back-side portions; and

 
   a substantially continuous gather is formed along an 

entire periphery of the diaper through said stomach-side 
portion, said back-side portion and said first and second 

expansible panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disposable diaper for use
of infants, incontinent persons, and adults as defined in the
preamble of the claim.In general, a disposable diaper is of a flat type and
usually comprises an elongated body including a liquid
permeable topsheet, a liquid impermeable backsheet, and an
absorbent member interposed between the topsheet and the
backsheet. The elongated body has a stomach-side portion
which is located on the stomach side of a diaper wearer
when the diaper is worn, and a back-side portion which is
located on the back side of the wearer when the diaper is
worn.Recently, there has been proposed a shorts type
disposable diaper in which a pair of leg opening portions
and a single waist opening portion are formed by affixing
the stomach-side portion to the back-side portion through
a pair of side flaps which are formed on the body along
its longitudinal sides (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. Sho 61-207605).In the shorts type disposable diaper above outlined,
the pair of leg opening portions are expansible so that
the diaper fits well to the body contour of the diaper 
wearer. Usually, the wearer puts on the diaper while
standing. Therefore, this diaper is used as a toilet
training for encouraging the infant wearer to finish with
a diaper (i.e., to be well without the diaper), or for the
use of incontinent persons or adults who can walk.Also, the above-mentioned shorts type disposable
diaper has, when compared with a so-called flat-type
diaper, the features in the respect that the diaper wearer
can pull it upwardly or downwardly by himself/herself just
like a normal undergarment. However, in order for the
diaper wearer to easily put on the diaper by himself/herself
and not to allow the discharged materials to leak, an
excellent fit is required for the shorts type disposable
diaper. Furthermore, compliance enough to follow the busy
movements of the diaper wearer is required. A disposable diaper of the shorts type, as defined in the
preamble of the claim, is known from EP-A-487 921. The known
disposable diaper includes waist opening elastic members, leg
opening elastic members, and further elastic members arranged
between the waist opening elastic members and the leg opening
elastic members for gathering the body-surrounding portion
therebetween. The further elastic members are threads arranged
straight and parallel to the periphery of the waist opening,
but distant thereto. Side edges of the stomach-side portion
and the back-side portion are fixedly attached

<CLAIMS>
A shorts type disposable diaper (1) comprising a body
(10) having a liquid permeable topsheet (11), a liquid

impermeable backsheet (12), and an absorbent member (13)
interposed between said topsheet and said backsheet;


said body (10) comprising a stomach-side portion (C)
which is located on the stomach side of a diaper wearer

when the diaper is worn,
a back-side portion (A) which is located on the back-side of the

wearer when the diaper is worn,
and a crotch portion (B) which

is located between said stomach-side portion and said
back-side portion;
said stomach-side portion being affixed to said back-side
portion at lateral sides thereof to thereby define

a waist opening portion (15), a pair of leg opening
portions (17,17') and a body-surrounding portion located

around the wearer's body when the diaper is worn;
elastic members (23,23',21,21') being arranged on an area
adjacent to said waist opening portion (15) and on said

body-surrounding portion in said stomach-side and back-side
portions;
a substantially continuous gather being formed along an
entire periphery of the diaper through said stomach-side

portion and said back-side portion;
a plurality of said elastic members (21,21') in the area
adjacent to said waist opening portion (15) being arranged

substantially in parallel with a peripheral edge (14) of 
said waist opening portion (15) with a predetermined

space; and
said elastic members (23,23') in the areas adjacent to
said waist opening portion (15) being different in

contracting stress from said elastic members (21,21') in
said body-surrounding portion; and said elastic members

(23,23') in the areas adjacent to said waist opening
portion (15) having a greater stress at 50% stretch than

said elastic members (21,21') in said body-surrounding
portion;
characterized in that
said body (10) has a pair of first expandable side panels
(20), each of said first expandable side panels being

affixed to each longitudinal side of said stomach-side
portion (C)

and a pair of second expandable side panels (20'), each of said
second expandable side panels (20') being affixed to each

longitudinal side of said back-side portion (A);
said first expandable side panels (20) of said stomach-side
portion (C) are affixed to said second expandable

side panels (20') of said back-side portion (A) to
define said waist and leg opening portions and to form

said substantially continuous gather along said entire
periphery of said diaper;
said elastic members (21,21') in said body-surrounding
portion are arranged in such a manner that at least a

part (21b,21b') of said elastic members cooperatively
form a loop, and
said back-side portion (A) and said stomach-side portion
(C) defining said waist opening portion (15) are

different in stress at 50% stretch.
