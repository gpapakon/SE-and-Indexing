<ABSTRACT>
A communication protocol for use in mobile network 
such as a TETRA or GSM network is proposed. The protocol more 

particularly is concerned with the signalling associated to 
half-duplex communications wherein a mobile terminal (A, B) 

communicates with a base station (BS) in one direction only 
by using a plurality of time slots per communication frame 

(USF1/17, DSF1/17) of either a downlink (DL) or uplink (UL) 
channel. 
The protocol associates to these communications a 
full-duplex signalling channel by allocating a single signalling 

time slot of both uplink and downlink signalling frames 
thereto. In this way an hitherto unnoticed drawback of known 

protocols is avoided, namely the wasting of bandwidth through 
allocation of multiple signalling time slots as well as the 

ambiguity of the network terminals as to which of these time 
slots is to be used by them or will be used by their communication 

partners.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
protocol for establishing communications between a first
terminal and at least one second terminal and including the
following steps:
providing an uplink channel and a downlink channel for communication
from and towards said first terminal respectively;providing on each of said channels periodically reoccurring
communication frames of communication time slots and signalling
frames of signalling time slots; and,allocating to said second terminal and on either of said
uplink and said downlink channels a plurality of said communication
time slots per said communication frame and in
predetermined positions thereof.Such a communication protocol for communication
between a base station (the first terminal) and at least one
mobile terminal (the second terminal) is already known in the
art and is proposed for the future Trans-European Trunked
RAdio or TETRA network currently under standardization by the
European Telecommunications Standardization Institute ETSI.A similar protocol is known from WO-A-89 10668.During the allocated communication time slots the
mobile terminal is thus able to perform a so called half-duplex
communication, i.e. a communication in one direction
on either the uplink or the downlink channel. This is in
contrast with full-duplex communications when the mobile
terminal performs both uplink and downlink communications on
both the above channels and is particularly advantageous for
data transfers from or to the mobile terminal, e.g. to upload
or download the memory of a computer of this mobile terminal
since then communication in only one direction is needed.The above half-duplex communications, in using more
than one time slot per communication frame, are further also
advantageous compared to the full-duplex communications since
their transfer rate may be higher than with the latter type
of communication. Indeed, with full-duplex communication only 
one time slot per communication frame may be used in mobile
networks of the TETRA or GSM type in order to allow sufficient
separation between transmit and receive bursts of each of
the mobile terminal.According to the above known protocol these half-duplex
communications should nevertheless be provided with a
full-duplex signalling channel, signalling time slots on both
the downlink and uplink channels should be allocated thereto.
It is thought that all problems associated to this allocation
are solved by allocating half a signalling time slot to each
half-duplex communication since in so doing,

Communication protocol for establishing communications
between a first terminal (BS) and at least one second

terminal (A, B) and including the following steps:

providing an uplink channel (UL) and a downlink channel
(DL) for communication from and towards said first terminal

respectively;
providing on each of said channels periodically reoccurring
communication frames (DCF1/17, UCF1/17) of communication time

slots and signalling frames (DSF, USF) of signalling time
slots; and,
allocating to said second terminal (A, B) and on either of
said uplink and said downlink channels a plurality of said

communication time slots per said communication frame and in
predetermined positions thereof;
characterized in that
 it also includes the step of allocating
to said second terminal (A, B) and on each of said uplink

(UL) and downlink (DL) channels at least part of a single one
of said signalling time slots per said signalling frame.
Communication protocol according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 said communication (DCF1/17, UCF1/17)
and signalling (USF, DSF) frames contain an equal number of

time slots and that said single signalling time slot occupies
in each of said signalling frames a position corresponding to

one of said predetermined positions.
Communication protocol according to claim 2,

characterized in that
 it also includes the step of providing
on each of said channels (DL, UL) like time division multiple

access structures arranged in periodically recurrent multiframes
(DMFR, UMFR) subdivided in at least a said signalling

frame (DSF, USF) and a said communication frame (DCF1/17,
UCF1/17), as well as the step of delaying said time division

multiple access structure on a first of said channels (UL) 
with respect to said time division multiple access structure

on a second of said channels (DL) over a fixed number of said
time slots, said single time slot occupying the first/last of

said predetermined positions when said communication frames
are allocated on said first/last channel respectively.
Communication protocol according to claim 3,

characterized in that
 said structures are delayed over two
time slots.
Base station (BS) for communicating with at
least one mobile terminal (A, B) according to a communication

protocol as per any of the previous claims and including
processor means for selecting said single time slot per

signalling frame (DSF, USF) in said downlink/uplink channel
(DL, UL) to transmit/receive signalling data to/from said

corresponding mobile terminal.
Mobile terminal (A, B) for communicating with a
base station (BS) according to a communication protocol as

per any of the claims 1 to 4, and including processor means
for selecting said single time slot per signalling frame

(DSF, USF) in said downlink/uplink channel (DL, UL) to
receive/transmit signalling data from/to said base station.
