<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of 
biotin using a genetically engineered organism. Biotin (vitamin Bâ‚ˆ or vitamin H), a coenzyme for 
carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions, is an essential 
metabolite for living cells. Exogenous biotin is required 
for most higher organisms; however many bacteria synthesize 
their own biotin. The enzymatic steps involved in the biotin synthetic 
pathway from pimelyl-CoA (PmCoA) to biotin have been 
elucidated in Escherichia coli and Bacillus sphaericus 
[Fig. 1; reviewed in Perkins and Pero, Bacillus subtilis and 
other Gram-Positive Bacteria, ed. Sonenshein, Hoch, and 
Losick, Amer. Soc. of Microbiology, pp. 325-329 (1993)]. The 
steps include the conversions of 1) pimelyl-CoA to 7-keto-8-amino 
pelargonic acid (7-KAP or KAPA) by 7-KAP synthetase 
(bioF); 2) 7-KAP to 7,8-diamino-pelargonic acid (DAPA) by 
DAPA aminotransferase (bioA); 3) DAPA to dethiobiotin (DTB) 
by DTB synthetase (bioD); and 4) DTB to biotin by biotin 
synthetase (bioB). Synthesis of PmCoA reportedly involves 
different enzymatic steps in different microorganisms. The 
E. coli genes involved in steps preceding pimelyl-CoA 
synthesis include bioC [Otsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem.263, 
19577-19585 (1988)] and bioH [O'Regan et al., Nucleic Acids 
Res.17, 8004 (1989)] . In B. sphaericus, two different 
genes, bioX and bioW, are thought to be involved in PmCoA 
synthesis. BioX is thought to be involved in pimelate 
biosynthesis [Gloeckler et al., Gene87, 63-70 (1990)], and 
bioW has been shown to encode pimelyl-CoA synthetase which 
converts pimelic acid (PmA) to PmCoA [Ploux et al., Biochem. 
J.287, 685-690 (1992)]. Neither B. sphaericus gene, bioW or 
bioX, has significant sequence similarity with the E. coli 
bioC and bioH genes either at the nucleotide or protein level 
[Gloeckler et al. (1990) supra].  In E. coli, the biotin biosynthetic genes are located 
in three or more operons in the chromosome. The bioA gene is 
located in one operon and the bioBFCD genes are located in a 
second closely linked operon. The bioH gene is unlinked to 
the other bio genes (Fig. 2; Eisenberg, M.A. 1987 in 
Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and 
Molecular Biology, vol. 1, Amer. Soc. Micro. Wash. D.C.). In B. sphaericus, the organization of the bio genes is 
clearly different from that in E. coli. Gloeckler et al. 
[(1990) supra] have isolated and characterized two unlinked 
DNA fragments from B. sphaericus that encode bio genes. One 
fragment contains an operon encoding the
