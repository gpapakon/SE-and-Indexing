<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the plasticization of
ethylene vinyl alcohol, and in particular relates to a
chlorine free heat shrinkable plastic film for which the
predominant oxygen barrier layer is formed of ethylene vinyl
alcohol and a plasticizing terpolymer.In the packaging and delivery of certain food products,
such as cheese, pork, smoked and processed meats, and
particularly fresh red meat, there exists the need to protect
the meat for the period of time from when it is first
butchered until it is used by the end consumer. In
particular, because oxygen promotes micrcbial degradation in
such meats, the most pertinent requirement for protecting
fresh red meat is long term protection against oxygen.One excellent material for preventing the passage of
oxygen is thin, but multilayer sheet wrapping material or film
in which the oxygen barrier is formed of one or more layers of
polyvinylidene chloride, which is also referred to as "PVDC"
or "saran". As its name implies, however, one of the key
ingredients of PVDC is chlorine. There presently exist a
number of reasons, including environmental considerations,
that make the elimination of chlorine desirable in such sheet
wrap materials.Accordingly, other materials have been included in sheet
wrap materials to provide the oxygen barrier. One material
which has good oxygen barrier characteristics under certain
conditions is ethylene vinyl alcohol, often abbreviated as
"EVOH". EVOH, however, tends to lose its oxygen barrier
properties when subjected to moisture. As would be expected,
fresh red meats and similar food products contain high amounts
of moisture which in turn tend to degrade the otherwise useful
oxygen barrier properties of EVOH. Another requirement of such a film is that it be
physically strong. In this regard, certain olefin products
such as polypropylene and polyethylene form sheet materials
with excellent strength characteristics, but which tend to
have relatively high oxygen transmission rates. Accordingly,
multilayer plastic films often include polyolefin layers for
strength in combination with layers of other materials that
have better barrier characteristics.As implied by the designation "heat shrinkable", another
desirable property of the film is that it be compatible with
heat shrinking processes that are often used in conjunction
with such films. As is known to those familiar with heat
shrinkable products and processes, the term "orientation" is
used to refer to various deformation processes carried out on
plastic film materials
