<ABSTRACT>
The outer surface of an article (10) is covered with a 
wrapping film (1), and both ends of the wrapping film (1) are 

lap-welded by heating, so that a body seal section (4) is 
created. A removal tab (7) is created at a position close to 

the longitudinal end thereof by slits (5) and (6) that are 
spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance and 

cut parallel to each other along the marginal line of the body 
seal section (4) on an upper overlapping film of the wrapping 

film (1). A perforated section (8) is created and extended in 
line with the slit (6) that constitutes the removal tab (7) in 

such a way that it crosses an imaginary continuation from the 
slit (6) and departs from another imaginary continuation from 

the slit (5). The end of the removal tab (7) is picked up with 
fingers, and the fingers are moved in a direction of an arrow 

A, and the wrapping film (1) is torn up from the slits (5) and 
(6). A split from the slit (6) reaches the perforated section 

8. Further pulling of the removal tab (7) in the A direction 
causes the split from the slit (6) to spread along the 

perforated section (8), and another split from the slit (5) 
also spreads, whereby the wrapping film (1) is widely opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wrapped article 
in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1 
and more particularly to a wrapped article in 
such a form that a wrapping film is attached in close contact 
with an object to be wrapped, for example, a wrapped article 
which contains one or a number of objects such as a magnetic 
tape cassette housed in a case. Such a wrapped article is already well known in the 
prior art as shown in Fig. 19 discussed lateron. Document GB-A-2212471 discloses a packaging comprising a film 
material having a tear strip and additionally a weakening in the 
form of, for example, perforations arranged adjacent the tear 
strip to facilitate the removal of the film. Document GB-A-2123376 already shows a tear-open package, whereby 
a magnetic tape cassette in a case is over-wrapped with a 
plastic film having a tear tape, whereby the edge portions of 
the film are overlapped and glued together, whereby the tear 
tape extends between the overlapped edge portions.  
 Among various types of recent commodities arranged in a 
shop, in the case of relatively small products having a regular 
shape such as a magnetic tape cassette, the product is wrapped 
with a transparent or translucent wrapping film coated with 
cellophane, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, 
polyvinylidenechloride, or the like, in order to protect the 
product from dust or moisture and so maintain a good 
appearance. These magnetic tape cassettes are shipped as a 
wrapped article or displayed in the shop as one of a number of 
packages to be sold en block in which an appropriate number of 
goods are collectively packed. As a matter of course, when an article (a product) 
wrapped in this type of wrapping film is used, it is necessary  
 
to remove this wrapping film. In most cases, as shown in 
Figure 19, a tearing tape 2 is formed inside the wrapping film, 
and a constitution for facilitating the removal of the film 
from an article 10 is generally adopted. In other words, this tearing tape 2 allows a wrapping 
film 1 to be appropriately split and separated by pulling an 
exposed end 2a of the tape 2. Slits 3 are cut along this 
tearing tape in the vicinity of the exposed end 2a, thereby 
facilitating the removal of the tape. By means of such a 
constitution, the wrapping film 1 can be split along the 
tearing tape 2 from the end 2a. As a result of this, the 
wrapping film 1 is split up completely or separated in two. A wrapping method which is generally called shrink-wrap 
is widely used for such a

<CLAIMS>
A wrapped article including an article to be wrapped 
whose outer surface is covered with a wrapping film (1) 

and a body seal section (4) created by making ends of the 
wrapping film overlap with each other and bonding them 

together,
 
   a removal tab portion (7) made up of two slits (5,6) 

that are spaced apart from each other by an interval and 
cut along the edge of the body seal section (4) of an 

upper wrapping film of the wrapping film (1) in the body 
seal section (4),
characterised by
 
   at least one perforated (8,8;9) or 

indentation line which starts from a point at which the 
perforated or indentation line and an imaginary 

continuation from at least one of the two slits (5,6) of 
the removal tab (7) meet and which extends in a direction 

moving away from the imaginary continuation of the other 
slit, whereby no tearing tape is present. 
A wrapped article as defined in claim 1, further 

comprising a second perforated (8,8';9) or 
indentation line which starts from a point at which the second 

perforated or indentation line and the imaginary 
continuation from the other slit meet, and which extends 

in a direction moving away from the first perforated 
or indentation line.  

 
A wrapped article as defined in claim 1, comprising 
at least one second perforated (8,8;9) or 

indentation line which starts from a point at which the second 
perforated or indentation line and the imaginary 

continuation from the other slit meet, and which extends 
parallel to the first perforated or indentation line. 
A wrapped article as defined in one of claims 1, 2 or 
3, wherein the front or rear surface of the removal tab 

(7) portion is printed in ink (16) that differs in 
coefficient of thermal contraction from the wrapping film. 
A wrapped article as defined in one of claims 1, 2 or 
3, wherein the removal tab (7) is provided with a mark to 

make clear the removal tab and a peeling direction.
