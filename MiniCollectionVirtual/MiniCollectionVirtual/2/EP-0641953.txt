<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a variable force die 
spring (20) as disclosed which combines high force, short 

axial compression distance spring assembly (72), such as 
belleville springs, and low force, high axial compression 

distance springs (70), such as coil springs, in a 
telescoping casing (24,26) having an internal cavity 

(60). The springs are arranged within the cavity so that 
upon receiving a load the low force spring will compress 

first resulting in a large axial compression and low force 
resistance. The load applied to the telescoping casing 

(24,26) will then transition from the low force spring to 
the high force spring. The high force spring then 

compresses as the load continues to be applied. In 
alternative embodiments, a third intermediate spring is 

addred that compresses moderate distances under moderate 
pressure thereby increasing the overall axial compression 

and load capacity capabilities of the spring assembly. In 
any embodiment, the invention results in a spring that 

provides high forces and low axial compression when it is 
nearly fully compressed and low forces and high axial 

compression at all other stages of compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to power 
presses and more particularly to high force springs used 
in tooling operations. In the metalworking industry, power presses are 
often used to form stock material such as steel or sheet 
metal into a variety of components. For example, in the 
automotive industry, sheet stock is formed into components 
of relatively small parts, such as engine struts, as well 
as significantly larger vehicle body components, such as 
deck lids, doors, and quarter panels. In these 
operations, the work piece is typically drawn or struck 
one or more times between upper and lower die halves to 
form the stock into a desired shape. Due to the 
particular shape of the article, in many applications it 
is necessary to perform an operation on the work piece at 
an angle other than with the travel of the press. For 
example, it may be necessary to punch an opening into or 
trim flash from the edge of the work piece. Cam units are often used in power presses to 
perform these auxiliary tooling operations such as 
punching, forming, re-striking, flanging and trimming. An 
example of such a cam unit can be seen in co-pending 
Application Serial No. 07/819,347 (US-A-5 269 167). As shown in that 
application, the cam unit is equipped with a tool mounted 
on a slide block and is installed on either the lower die  
 
or the upper die of the power press. The cam is 
constructed such that as the power press cycles, the cam 
unit compresses in a manner that converts the vertical 
motion of the press into a lateral motion of the tool 
mounted on the cam. This lateral movement brings the tool 
into contact with the work piece and thereby provides the 
force required to perform the tooling operation. Cam units used in tooling operations typically 
require springs that will provide both the force needed to 
move a slide block with an attached tool into home 
position and provide the force needed to perform the 
desired stripping/work holding operation. However, the 
force required to perform the stripping/work holding 
operation is usually much greater than the force required 
to move the slide block. Most conventional springs are 
limited in the amount of force they exert. Therefore, to 
attain the desired stripping/work holding forces, 
conventional springs would have to be used in such numbers 
and be preloaded to such a degree that they would prove 
ill suited for most cam designs. Moreover, the force 
build-up to the slide block while being placed in position 
to do work would then be
