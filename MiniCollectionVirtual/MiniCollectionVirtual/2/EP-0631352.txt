<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) includes mounting posts 
(30, 32) for insertion into through-holes (34, 36) of a 

printed circuit board (38). The connector includes a 
connector housing having an upper connection surface (12) 

and a lower board mounting surface (14). A pair of counting 
posts (30, 32) extend from the lower mounting surface (14) 

adjacent each end of the connector (10). Each of the 
mounting posts (30, 32) is insertable into a through-hole 

(34,36) in the printed circuit for frictional engagement 
with the walls of through-hole. The mounting posts (30, 32) 

include curved portions (44) for engagement with the walls 
of the through-holes. The curved portions (44) of the 

mounting posts have a radius of curvature which is 
substantially less than the radius of curvature of the 

through-holes (34, 36) to compensate for variations in 
tolerance as between the mounting post and the through-holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
electrical connector for mounting to a printed circuit board
or similar substrate. More particularly, the present
invention relates to connector mounting posts which are
insertable into holes in the printed circuit board to
support the electrical connector thereon.
A connector having the features of the preamble of claim 1 is,
for instance, known from EP-A-0 366 964.It has been long known to use mounting posts which
extend from an electrical connector to support the connector
on a printed circuit board or other substrate to which the
electrical connector is to be attached. These mounting
posts are insertable into through-holes of the printed
circuit board and locate and secure the connector to the
printed circuit board prior to permanent connection such as
by soldering the electrical contacts of the connector to the
printed circuit board.As may be appreciated, the relative positioning of
the mounting posts with respect to the through-holes of the
printed circuit board is critical in achieving a secure fit
between the connector and the printed circuit board.
Variations as between the diameter of the through-hole and
the diameter of the mounting post could render insertion of
the mounting post in the through-hole difficult. The
distance between through-holes of the printed circuit board,
as it relates to the distance between the mounting posts, is
also critical in assuring proper positioning of the
connector with respect to the printed circuit board. Even
slight variations between the spacing of the through-holes
of the printed circuit board and the spacing of the mounting
posts could cause significant interference between the posts
and the through-holes so as to render insertion difficult.In addition, engagement of the mounting posts with
the through-holes of the printed circuit board is designed
to be a frictional fit so that the connector is temporarily
secured to the printed circuit board prior to soldering the 
connector contacts to the board. This again adds a further complication which renders
proper positioning of the posts with respect to the through-holes difficult.It is, therefore, desirable to provide an electrical connector having mounting
posts which facilitate the easy mounting of an electrical connector to a printed circuit
board.It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrical connector having
mounting posts which permit the connector to be easily supported over through-holes of
a printed circuit board.It is a further object
