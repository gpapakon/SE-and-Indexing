<ABSTRACT>
Polyester composition with improved impact properties, improved oxygen permeability and improved dimensional skrinkage during heating. Impact modifiers are dissolved into a molten polyester to form a eutectic alloy. On slow cooling, the eutectic alloy of the invention freezes to form a mixture of particles of the impact modifier embedded in a matrix of the polyester. By controlling the solidification of the melt, the size and distribution of the precipitates from the melt can be controlled, which allows control of the mechanical properties. The precipitation can also be controlled either by homogenous nucleation or by heterogeneous nucleation through the addition of a nucleating agent or the introduction of a suitable surface for nucleation. The invention also provides a process of manufacturing the above polyester, an article comprising this polyester and a process for making this article. The crystalline polyester article is useful as a container for microwavable, ovenable and/or frozen foods, and has improved gas barrier properties, impact strength, and post-mold dimensional stability between -60  DEG C and 200  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for producing a thermoplastic
crystallizable impact modified polyester composition having improved
gas barrier and dimensional stability characteristics.Polyesters have heretofore been widely used in the food package
industry, including blister packs for meats, containers for frozen foods,
ovenable and microwavable (« dual ovenable ») trays and carbonated
beverage bottles. A major effort in such packaging applications has been
directed toward reducing the gas permeability of the package, since a
decrease in such permeability will lead to a longer shelf life of the food
product, be it at frozen refrigerated or ambient temperature storage.
Another focus of great effort in the food packaging industry is the
dimensional stability of the package over long periods of time at ambient
temperature or upon heating of the contents in either microwave or
conventional ovens. Of particular concern in this regard are the breakage
of seals and warping due to excessive shrinkage of the container during
retort or any of the thermal sterilization processes. Still another effort of
great focus is the impact strength of the package at low temperatures.
Improved impact strength of the package allows for greater durability at
low temperature applications which translates to greater versatility of the
packaging product.A number of prior patents have addressed the above-mentioned
concerns, for the most part individually. As a result, for example,
polyester compositions that are particularly suitable as carbonated
beverage containers due to there low gas permeability, are generally
unsuitable for applications and processes requiring elevated
temperatures, as these materials generally exhibit excessive shrinkage
and warping at these higher temperatures. Examples of such prior
activity include : U.S. Patent No. 4,560,741 discloses a polyester resin derived from
a C(2-8) diol, oxydiacetic acid and naphthalene dicarboxylic acid having
improved resistance to gas permeability as compared to polyethylene
terephthalate homopolymers.U.S. Patent No. 3,960,807 discloses a heat-set article comprising
a polymeric crack-stopping agent and a nucleant as having a good
dimensional stability and impact resistance.U.S. Patent No. 4,463,121 discloses thermoformed articles of
partially crystallized polyethylene terephthalate and a polyolefin, as
having improved impact resistance and high temperature dimensional
stability.U.S. Patent No. 4,572,852 discloses a crystalline polyethylene
terephthalate/polyolefin article

improved gas barrier properties comprising the steps :
