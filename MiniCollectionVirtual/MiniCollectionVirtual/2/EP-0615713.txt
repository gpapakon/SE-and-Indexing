<ABSTRACT>
In an "Espresso" coffee brewing machine (1) the filter-holder box (10) is 
articulated and can be operated by a user through organs (18, 15, 7) suited to 

moving it between a first closed position under a hot-water distributor (4) and a 
second open position in which it is distanced at a angle from said distributor 

(4) so as to present the filter (12) exposed and tilted towards the user that can 
load a cartridge of coffee into it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a filter-holder box to load a dose of coffee into 
the brewing chamber of a coffee brewing machine. Coffee brewing machines are known into the filter of which a dose of coffee is 
loaded; this dose may be loose coffee powder or coffee packaged in cartridges, 
that is in the form of disks comprising coffee powder compressed between walls 
of permeable paper. In a first type of machine the dose of coffee is loaded into a removable box; the 
user disengages said box from the machine, places a dose of coffee inside, loose 
powder or in the cartridge form, so that the dose will be lodged within a 
brewing chamber defined between a hot water distributing organ and the filter-holder 
box. In the following description we shall more simply define said hot-water 
distributing organ - distributor - and said filter-holder box - box-. In a second type of machine the dose of coffee is loaded into a non-removable 
box, but that features a vertical, or vertical and horizontal movement as a 
consequence of which the filter is disengaged from the distributor and comes to 
be horizontally exposed in order to receive the dose of coffee. In the first type of machine, especially the engagement of the removable box 
involves an operation that most users find difficult; it often means engaging the 
box by a number of trials by means of a bayonet device the users cannot see. In the second type of machine the disengagement and engagement of the box 
means first operating a lever to vertically release the box, and then on a knob to 
shift the box horizontally, elementary operations in themselves, but that 
generally annoy the user that is aware of going through at least four different 
operations to load and unload a dose of coffee. Moreover, a box devised to be  
 
operated as described above does not realize a good fastening and sealing of the 
dose of coffee within the brewing chamber. The box according to the present invention obviates the inconveniences of the 
state of the art and presents advantages that will be apparent from the 
description below. This box is associated to the machine and may not be removed by an user and, 
as characterized in the claims, is fitted within the machine so as to be operated 
by a user who can move between a first closed position in which it is fastened 
under the distributor and a second open position in which it is angled away from 
said distributor with the filter exposed tilted towards the user to then be shifted 
from said second position to said first
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A filter-holder box (10) to load a dose of coffee into the brewing chamber (6-11) 
of a coffee brewing machine (1) in which said box (10) presents filter (12) 

on which to place this dose of coffee characterized in that it is articulated within 
the machine and operated by a user by means organs suited to moving it from 

a first closed position in which it is fastened under the hot-water distributor (4) 
to a second open position in which it is distanced at an angle from said 

distributor (4) with filter (12) exposed and tilted towards the user so as to be, 
then, moved from said second position to said first position again under said 

distributor (4) with the dose of coffee placed on filter (12). 
Filter-holder box (10) according to claim 1 characterized in that it is 
articulated within the machine so that in said second position it is presented 

forward, compared to the closed position, horizontally towards the front of the 
machine, tilted towards the user. 
Filter-holder box (10) according to claims 1 and 2 characterized in that the 
means with which it is articulated within the machine include an arm (7) that has 

one end fixed to the box (7, 10) and the other end articulated (8) to a fixed 
support (9) so that the filter-holder box (10) moves along an arc and that the 

means with which it is operated comprise a motor means (18) that will drag the 
filter-holder box (10) downward or upward through a linking element (15) that 

has one end jointed to said box (10) and the other end moved upward or 
downward by said motor means(18). 
Filter-holder box (10) according to claim 3 characterized in that said motor 
means is a lever (18) to be manually operated. 
Filter-holder box (10) according to claim 3 characterized in that said motor 
 

means is an electric motor.
