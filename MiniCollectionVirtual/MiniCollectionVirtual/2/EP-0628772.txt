<ABSTRACT>
The method of operating a domestic electric oven equipped with a circulating fan (M), fan-controlled heating element (R3) and upper (R1) and lower (R2) oven heating elements uses two modes of energisation. On closing (S1) the first mode promotes rapid heat-up of the oven via the closed thermostat (B) contact, change-over switch (S2), fan (M) and its element (R3) indicated by the lamps (H1,E). After a preset time, the electronic controller automatically triggers the second mode via the switch (S2) during which the fan (M) runs with its heater (R3) switched off and the heaters (R1,R2) switched on throughout a second preset time. The cycle is repeated subject always to the thermostat (B) setting and required overall cooking duration.

A method for operating an electric baking oven with a ring-shaped fan 
heater around the fan wheel of a fan which is able to be driven by an electric 

motor, and with an upper heat heater and a lower heat heater,
 
charactensed in that 


a baking process is begun in a first type of operation with a first cycle time 
which is able to be preset in circulating air operation with the fan (M) switched 

on and with the fan heater (R3) switched on, 
that thereafter a switchover takes place to a second type of operation with a 
second cycle time which is able to be preset in circulating air operation with the 

fan (M) switched on and with the upper heat heater and lower heat heater (R1, 
R2) switched on, and 
that the baking process is continued alternately in the first and second type of 
operation with the preset first and preset second cycle time until completion of 

the preset baking time. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the first cycle time for the first type of operation is selected at 5 minutes and 

greater. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the first and second cycle times are preset by means of selector switches. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the first and second cycle times are preset by a thermostat and amount to 

integral multiples of the switching periods thereof.  
 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the cycle times of the types of operation are altered and preset as a junction of 

the selection of cooked matter categories. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the cycle times are fixedly preset.
