<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous ink compositions containing anti-curl 
agents substantially reduce or eliminate paper curl in 

plain-paper printed elements without adversely effecting 
storage stability, decap properties or print quality, 

and thus eliminate the need for expensive and bulky 
mechanical curl-arresting devices or special curl-resistant 

substrates. Printing the inks on plain-paper 
substrates is the sole step in a process for reducing 

paper curl in plain-paper printed elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous
pigmented ink jet ink compositions which
eliminate curl in printed plain-paper elements.Ink jet printing is a non-impact method that
produces droplets of ink that are deposited on a
substrate such as paper or transparent film in response
to an electronic digital signal. Thermal or bubble jet
drop-on-demand ink jet printers have found broad
application as output for personal computers in the
office and the home.Aqueous inks used in ink jet printing have water as
a major component. Water has the advantage of being
non-toxic, non-combustible and environmentally sound
relative to non-aqueous inks which are largely composed
of organic solvents. Water is also an excellent media
for dispersed pigments or dissolved dyes.The use of water in large concentrations, however,
also has several disadvantages. Water has a slow
evaporation rate relative to low-boiling organic
solvents, which reduces the rate of drying and, thus,
the rate of printing. Water also interacts with paper
to cause two major distortions known as paper cockle and
paper curl. Paper cockle is a distortion in which
bumps, indentations and other irregularities are
randomly produced on the printed paper, giving the paper
a "wrinkled" appearance. Curl is a phenomena in which
the edges of the paper migrate towards the center of the
paper. The direction of curl may be on the printed side
of the paper, or it may be on the non-printed side (the
latter being known as "reverse curl"). Curl may appear immediately after printing or may
take a day or two to manifest. In its final state, the
paper sheet may take the form of a tube. Curled paper
cannot be stacked, sheet upon sheet, thereby causing
much inconvenience to the user. Curled sheets are
difficult to display or store and cannot be used in
processes requiring near planarity, such as media
feeding, tracking, and print alignment. Curl is most
prevalent in solid fill printing and is therefore a more
acute problem in graphics as opposed to text printing.
For the same reason, it is mostly a concern in 4 color
printing where graphics are prominent. The use of
heating elements (commonly employed to increase the rate
of drying of aqueous inks) are known to accelerate paper
curl.Various mechanical devices to reduce curl such as
heated rollers and tension applicators have been tried.
These devices are only marginally effective and add
considerably to the cost and size of the printer.
(Heated rollers used to reduce curl differ from the
heaters used to increase drying rate; in the
