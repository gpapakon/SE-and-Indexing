<ABSTRACT>
A container having an effective tamper-evident means 
has a container body whose rim defines an upwardly-open 

channel 8, and a lid with a downwardly dependent skirt 24 
received within the channel. The inner surface of the 

skirt has a step portion 28 which co-operates with a step 
portion 26 within the channel, to prevent relative 

movement of skirt and channel. The skirt can only lift 
from the channel once a tamper-evident portion 12 provided 

along a portion of the rim of the container body has been 
displaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tamper-evident container. Many types of tamper-evident container have been 
proposed, all having the common aim of enabling a consumer 
to see that access has been gained to the contents of a 
container, before the consumer has opened the container 
for the first time. There have been various problems with earlier tamper-evident 
containers. In some, it has been possible to 
remove the lid of the container and access the contents, 
without disturbing the tamper-evident means. In others, 
the tamper-evident means has been such as to make it 
difficult for the consumer to open the container. Yet 
other proposals have been overly complicated and 
expensive. It is an object of the invention to produce a tamper-evident 
container which is not overly expensive, and which 
is effective in preventing unauthorised access to the 
container before the consumer has first opened it, whilst 
not making it difficult for the consumer to open the 
container, for the first time or subsequently. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a container having an upwardly open container 
body and a lid, the container body having an upwardly open 
channel around its rim, defined by an inner upright wall, 
an outer upright wall and a lower connecting wall, the lid 
having a downwardly depending skirt adapted to locate 
within the channel wherein, around at least a portion of 
the channel there is a weak zone by means of which a 
tamper-evident portion of the outer wall may be broken off  
 
or permanently displaced, the skirt then being accessible, 
and displaceable outwardly, wherein the outer surface of 
the inner wall of the channel, and the inner surface of 
the skirt, have co-operating means which prevent the skirt 
from rising out of the channel, other than when the skirt 
is accessible following the breaking off or permanent 
displacement of the tamper-evident portion. The co-operating means may extend around the entire 
rim of the container. Alternatively, the co-operating 
means may extend only around a portion, or a plurality of 
discrete portions, of the rim. In containers which are of 
non-circular cross-section and which may be said to have 
"corners", the co-operating means preferably do not extend 
around the corners, but only along the regions 
therebetween. The co-operating means may suitably comprise inter-engaging 
step portions formed on the outer surface of the 
inner wall and the inner surface of the skirt. 
Preferably, at least one of the step portions has a

<CLAIMS>
A container having an upwardly open container body 
and a lid, the container body having an upwardly open 

channel around its rim, defined by an inner upright 
wall, an outer upright wall and a lower connecting 

wall, the lid having a downwardly depending skirt 
adapted to locate within the channel wherein, around 

at least a portion of the channel there is a weak 
zone by means of which a tamper-evident portion of 

the outer wall may be broken off or permanently 
displaced, the skirt then being accessible, and 

displaceable outwardly, wherein the outer surface of 
the inner wall of the channel, and the inner surface 

of the skirt, have co-operating means which prevent 
the skirt from rising out of the channel, other than 

when the skirt is accessible following the breaking 
off or permanent displacement of the tamper-evident 

portion. 
A container as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the cooperating 
means do not extend around the entire rim 

of the container. 
A container as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the 
container has corners and the co-operating means do 

not extend around the corners. 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the co-operating means suitably comprise 

inter-engaging step portions formed on the outer 
surface of the inner wall and the inner surface of 

the skirt. 
A container as claimed in Claim 4, wherein at least 
one of the step portions has a face which is at a 

slant angle to the inner wall and the skirt, such 
that the step portion of the skirt can slide over the 

step portion of the inner wall, to become disengaged 
therefrom, by upward and outward displacement of the 

skirt, once it has become accessible, following the 
breaking off or permanent displacement of the tamper-evident 

portion. 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the tamper-evident portion extends around 

only a small proportion of the rim of the container. 
A container as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the 
container has corners and the tamper-evident portion 

extends around at least one corner. 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the tamper-evident position is adapted to be 

permanently displaced, not broken off. 
A container substantially as hereinbefore described 
with reference to the drawings.
