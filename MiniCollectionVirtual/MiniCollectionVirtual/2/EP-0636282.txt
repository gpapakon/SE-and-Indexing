<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a laser device to be 
employed as continuous source of a single mode, 
monochromatic radiation in telecommunications, of the type 
including an active medium capable to emit a radiation at a 
first wavelength λ1, pumped by a laser capable to emit a 
radiation at a second wavelength λ2 < λ1. The device according to the invention has application 
in telecommunication systems and particularly it can be 
profitably employed, but not only, as continuous source at 
the frequency of 1.54 µm (the so-called third window) for 
coherent transmission in optical fiber. For optical fiber telecommunications future 
developments it is foreseen the use of a radiation having 
1,54 µm (1540 nm) wavelength corresponding to the so-called 
third window to which optical fibers for telecommunications 
present a reduced attenuation. A coherent light source for this use has to supply a 
sufficiently high output power, in the range of some mW to 
have practical applications, with single mode type 
emissions and with a width of the emitted spectrum line to 
be as reduced as possible. As an example, current sources of this kind are 
realized with single mode, DFB semiconductor laser, having 
typical optical powers of 1-4 mW in single mode fiber and 
1-30MHz linewidth. To obtain sources capable to produce the required 
wavelength, it was proposed as active medium the so-called 
glass lasers, that is including an Erbium (Er) doped glass. 
Two additional laser devices are employed as pump source,  
 
and particularly a semiconductor laser having 808 nm 
wavelength pumping a neodymium laser, which in its turn 
emits a 1060 nm radiation pumping the glass laser capable 
to emit the laser radiation at the desired wavelength of 
1.54 µm. Said glass lasers contain also a given ytterbium (Yb) 
percentage having the scope to increase the pumping yield 
since Ytterbium has an absorption band wider than the 
Erbium one, then transferring to this last the power 
absorbed. This device requires a double conversion and also the 
neodymium emission yield is very low (in the range of 1-2%), 
so as to render critical the operation of the device, 
therefore even minimum losses of the laser cavity can cause 
a poor output power, so that use has to be made of very 
accurate and expensive processing of the most critical 
components. In the paper "Diode-pumped CW Bulk Er:Yb: glass laser" 
by P. Laporta et. al., OPTICS LETTER, Vol. 16, no. 24, 
December 15, 1991, it was proposed to pump directly the 
glass laser through a
