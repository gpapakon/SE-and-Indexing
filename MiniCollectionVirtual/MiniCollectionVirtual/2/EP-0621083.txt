<ABSTRACT>
A device for emptying cartridges (7) has a frame (1), a threaded rod (2) and two rams (4) which are connected non-positively to the threaded rod (2) by means of a bar (3). The threaded rod (2) is supported rotatably on the frame (1) via a supporting joint (14). To empty the cartridges (7), the latter are inserted in the frame (1) and a mixing device (6) is attached thereto. Subsequently, the threaded rod (2) is turned by hand so that the two rams (4) move into the cartridges (7) and the components held in the cartridges (7) are squeezed out by means of a squeezing plunger (72) arranged in the cartridges (7). The two components are mixed together in the mixing device (6) and emerge therefrom as a ready-for-use compound. By means of such an embodiment of the device, a simple aid is provided for emptying cartridges (7), by means of which even high-viscosity components can be squeezed reliably out of the cartridges (7).

<CLAIMS>
A device for the simultaneous emptying of two cartridges (7) 
provided with one election piston (72) each, which device has a 

frame (1) for receiving the cartridges (7), a threaded rod (2) 
rotatable by hand, as well as a yoke (3) with two plungers (4) 

arranged thereon for actuating the ejection pistons (72), in 

which arrangement the yoke (3) is connected by means of an internal 
thread (30) to the threaded rod (2), and the latter is 

supported by means of a supporting joint (14) on the frame (1) in 
one direction with a force fit, so that the threaded rod (2), together 

with the plungers (4) can be pushed in the other direction 
into the inside of the frame (1). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
supporting joint (14) is formed by a step-shaped bore arranged in 

the frame (1), as well as a collar (20) arranged at the front 
side of the threaded rod (2). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the frame (1) is designed at its front side for attaching a mixer 

device (6), which allows the two constituents to be mixed. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that it is composed of several individual parts (1, 2, 

3, 4, 5, 6) that can be fitted together by the user.
