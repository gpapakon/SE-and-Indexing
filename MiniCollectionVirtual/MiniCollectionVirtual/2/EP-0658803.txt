<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
sensitizing a silver halide emulsion, said emulsion
showing an increased photographic speed and reduced
latent image fading, and to photographic elements
containing the emulsions.A visible image is formed in silver halide
photographic materials by exposure of the material to
actinic radiation to form a record of the exposure which
is invisible to the unaided eye, followed by processing
of the material to yield a visible image.The invisible record of exposure is referred to
as a latent image. It is generally agreed that the
latent image comprises minute specks of metallic silver
formed in or on individual silver halide grains by
interaction between silver ions and photoelectrons
generated by absorption of actinic radiation by the
silver halide grains.Processing of most common silver halide
photographic materials includes a development step in
which the material is contacted with an aqueous alkaline
solution of a developing agent. The developing agent is
a reducing agent which will selectively reduce to
metallic silver those silver halide grains containing a
latent image.It is known that the latent image is not
permanent and that, with the passage of time, silver
halide grains which would be developable immediately
after exposure become nondevelopable. This phenomenon is
termed latent image fading and manifests itself as a loss 
in image density in the developed image and a consequent
loss in speed in the silver halide photographic material.If silver halide materials were developed
immediately following imagewise exposure, latent image
fading would not be a problem. However, with many silver
halide materials, delays between exposure and processing
frequently occur. For example, with amateur film
materials in which multiple images are formed on a single
roll of film, there is often a delay of months between
the time the first image is exposed and the time the
exposed roll of film is sent for processing. With such
materials latent image fading can present a significant
problem, and compounds are added to photographic
materials to prevent or reduce it. These compounds are
referred to as latent image stabilizing compounds or
latent image stabilizers, and the prevention or reduction
of latent image fading is referred to as latent image
stabilization.Among latent image stabilizers known in the art
are N-2-propenylbenzothiazolium and naphthothiazolium
salts described in Arai et al U.S. Patent No. 3,954,478.
