<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor unit
and a method for mounting a semiconductor device, and
particularly to a method for forming a bump for electrically
connecting a terminal electrode of a circuit
board with an electrode pad of a semiconductor chip, to
a method for mounting a semiconductor device using the
bump, and to a semiconductor unit using the bump.Conventionally, a wire bonding method using a
soldering technique has been widely used in a process
for mounting a semiconductor device on a circuit board
having input/output terminal electrodes. Recently,
however, because the size of the package for a semiconductor
device has been reduced and the number of connecting
terminals has been increased, the pitch of the
connecting terminals has been shortened, thereby making
conventional soldering methods difficult to use for
such a bonding application.In order to solve this problem, recently,
improved methods have been proposed in which a semiconductor
device such as an integrated circuit chip, is
directly mounted on input/output terminal electrodes of
a circuit board, so that the mounting area is reduced
in size, thereby improving the utility efficiency.Among these improved methods, a flip chip
bonding method in which a semiconductor device is
mounted facedown on a circuit board is known to be 
effective because the semiconductor device is electrically
connected to a large number of the terminal electrodes
of the circuit board at a time with the resulting
connections having excellent mechanical strength.For example, a mounting method using a ball
bonding technique is described in "IC mounting technique",
edited by Nippon Microelectronics Association,
KOGYO CHOSAKAI, Jan. 15, 1980. Hereinafter, this
mounting method will be described.When an electrode pad 12 of a semiconductor
device (IC substrate) 11 is to be connected with an
input/output terminal electrode 18 of a circuit board
19, an adhesion metal film 22 and a diffusion-preventing
metal film 21 are first formed on the electrode pad
12 of the semiconductor device 11 by a vapor deposition
technique as shown in Figure 6A, and an electrical
contact (projecting electrode: bump) 20 made of solder
is then formed by a plating technique. Thereafter, the
thus formed IC chip is positioned so that the solder
bump 20 contacts with the terminal electrode 18, and
then placed facedown on the circuit board 19 as shown
in Figure 6B. The semiconductor unit is then heated to
a high temperature so that the solder bump 20 is fused
and bonded to the terminal
