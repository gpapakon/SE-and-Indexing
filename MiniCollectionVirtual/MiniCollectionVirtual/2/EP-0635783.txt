<ABSTRACT>
A multi-media system for interactive presentation of user information has 
a physical interface for receiving removable and unitary mass storage elements for 

therein storing an interactive user program, and selectively accesses the mass storage 
element. The system accesses and processes the user program, for subsequent display of 

processing results, in response to particular user actuation on a level of elementary user 
functionality. In particular, the processing includes blockwise conversion to object code 

of machine-type generic multi-instruction blocks read from the storage to machine-type 
specific object-code blocks for subsequent selective accessing of the object code for 

processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multi-media system for interactive presentation of user information, comprising interface means for reversibly interfacing to mass storage means containing an interactive user program, access means for selectively accessing said mass storage means, processing means connected to said accessing means for processing said user program, display means fed by said processing means for displaying processing results, and user actuation means for through selective user-actuation controlling said accessing means and said processing means on an elementary user functionality level.Multi-media means at least a combination of text, stationary graphics display and moving pictures, the latter either in animation or in more or less full motion video. Additional or alternative features may reside in further visual display types, as well as in speech or other audio representation, motion, or other sensory communication categories. The storage means is advantageously unitary in that it looks and/or feels like a finite and localized object, such as a disc, box, card or the like. In that case, the physical access means include some kind of berth means for reproducibly positioning of the storage means in or adjacent to the machine or system. The berth means will be dimensioned according to the mechanical format and physical interactivity of the accessing means. Various such berth means formats have been in common usage. On the other hand, the storage means may be represented by a shared data base, and in particular, inclusive of a program base that is distant from a local user person. The machine typically is stand-alone, although connection to a local area network is not ruled out. A typical example of such a system is the well-known Compact-Disc Interactive (CD-I) system that is being widely marketed at present, although the present invention is not particularly limited to the use with or in such CD-I system.Now, in a system of the general category listed supra, the user may answer questions posed by the machine, select menu items, access particular displayed free-style elements, thereby activating a particular machine response, make drawings or compose other information combinations for display and/or storage, or just view/listen to a continuous recorded program while still allowing standard recorder functions such as play, stop, fast forward/reverse, jump and possibly others. Inasmuch as the CD-I system is being contemplated for a wide range of applications, for various categories of user, and

<CLAIMS>
A multi-media system for interactive presentation of user information, comprising:

- interface means for reversibly interfacing to mass storage means (20) containing an interactive user program;
- access means (30) for selectively accessing said mass storage means;
- processing means (34) connected to said accessing means for processing said user program;
- display means (36) fed by said processing means for displaying processing results;
- and user actuation means for, through selective user-actuation, controlling said accessing means and said processing means in response to a user request or action, 
characterized in that
 said processing means includes:
- converter-to-object-code means (32) for, when a block of the user program must be accessed from mass storage during run-time execution of the user program, blockwise converting selectively accessed machine-type generic multi-instruction blocks of the user program read from said mass storage means to machine-type specific object code blocks for subsequent local storing, the machine-type generic multi-instruction blocks comprising elementary instructions that do not specify the actual operations on a register level according to the actual register configuration of the processing means;
- secondary accessing means for selective accessing of said locally stored machine-type specific object code.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said machine type generic instructions specify substantially all instructional codes and data elements as single characters.
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said mass storage means is unitary shaped and said interface means comprise berth means therefore for removable positioning of the mass storage means.
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein said mass storage means is disc shaped and in particular, optically readable disc shaped.
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein said mass storage means is tape-shaped and in particular, magnetically readable tape-shaped.
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein said mass storage means is solid state.
Computer program product (20) for use in a multi-media system according to claim 1 comprising interface means for reversibly interfacing to mass storage means for interactively presenting user information, the computer program product comprising an interactive user program allowing user-actuation of the multi-media system in response to a user request or action, the user program comprising machine-type generic multi-instruction blocks, the blocks comprising elementary instructions that do not specify the actual operations on a register level according to the actual register configuration of the multi-media system, wherein the blocks of the user program are, when a block of the user program must be accessed from mass storage during run-time execution of the user program, selectively accessible by said multi-media system for therein converting the machine-type generic multi-instruction blocks to machine-specific object code for subsequent local storing and subsequent selective accessing of said locally stored machine-type specific object code by the multi-media system.
A computer program product as claimed in claim 7, wherein said machine-type generic instructions specify substantially all instructional codes and data elements as single characters.
