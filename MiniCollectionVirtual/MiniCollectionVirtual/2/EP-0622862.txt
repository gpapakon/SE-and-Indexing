<ABSTRACT>
A secondary battery having a non-aqueous electrolyte 
according to the present invention includes a negative electrode 

using a carbonaceous material capable of dope and undope of 
lithium ions as an anode material, a positive electrode using a 

composite oxide of lithium and a transition metal as a cathode 
material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte formed by dissolving an 

electrolyte into a non-aqueous solvent, the non-aqueous solvent 
containing methylethyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate. 

According to the present invention, a secondary battery having 
a non-aqueous electrolyte in which normal charge/discharge 

reactions can be maintained even in battery overcharge or after 
high-temperature storage of a charged battery, and which exhibits 

a higher energy density, a longer cycle life, higher safety 
performance and excellent environment-resistance, can be 

produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a secondary battery having a non-aqueous
electrolyte, and particularly to a secondary battery of
a lithium ion based non-aqueous electrolyte employing a composite
oxide of lithium and a transition metal for the positive
electrode and a carbonaceous material capable of dope and undope
of lithium ions for the negative electrode.As typical secondary batteries, a nickel-cadmium battery and
a lead battery having aqueous electrolytes have been broadly
known. However, along with the recent consecutive emergence of
new types of electronic equipment, such as, a VTR with a built-in
camera, a portable phone and a lap top computer, higher energy
density for the secondary battery as a portable power source has
been demanded for a further reduction in size and weight of the
equipment. The nickel-cadmium battery and the lead battery no
longer can meet this demand. Also, nickel-cadmium and lead are
not preferable in terms of environmental protection, and the use
of these materials is subject to regulatory restraints in some
countries. Thus, it has been demanded to develop secondary
batteries employing alternates for these materials.A non-aqueous electrolyte battery employing a non-aqueous
electrolyte formed by dissolving an electrolyte into a non-aqueous
solvent is now noted as an alternate for the nickel-cadmium 
battery and the lead battery.A non-aqueous electrolyte battery of primary battery
application has already been developed. With the primary
battery, the negative electrode simply discharges, and does not
require reversibility. It can be said that characteristics of
the positive electrode determine the energy density of the
battery. For this reason, a wide variety of materials are
proposed and evaluated as activators employed for the positive
electrode.For developing the non-aqueous electrolyte battery of
secondary battery application, characteristics of the active
anode material are of greater importance to attain preferable
cyclic characteristics. However, despite a large of number of
reviews and examinations in view of the above, very little
results have been obtained.For example, though the lithium metal is used for the active
anode material of the non-aqueous electrolyte battery of primary
battery application, problems in using the lithium metal for a
negative electrode material of the secondary battery have been
pointed out from the initial stage of the review.Specifically, if the lithium metal is used as the active
anode material of the secondary battery, repetition of charge
