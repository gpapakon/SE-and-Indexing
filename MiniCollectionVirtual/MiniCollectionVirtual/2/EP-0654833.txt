<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus according to the invention comprises at least two optical 
microcavity light emitters. Each one of the at least two light emitters comprises 

spaced apart reflectors (e.g., 31, 361 and 362) that define a microcavity, and further 
comprises organic material (35) that is capable of electro-luminescence (e.g., tris (8-hydroxyquinolinol) 

aluminum, commonly referred to as "Alq"), and means for 
applying an electric field across the organic material. One of the at least two 

microcavities has effective optical length L₁, and the other microcavity has effective 
optical length L₂ ≠ L₁, with the optical lengths selected such that one of the 

microcavities emits radiation of a first color (e.g., red), and the other microcavity 
emits radiation of a second color (e.g., green). In many cases there will be present 

also a third microcavity that emits radiation of a third color (e.g., blue). In preferred 
embodiments there is present within the microcavities a filler layer (32), of thickness 

selected to provide to a given microcavity the desired optical length. A preferred 
embodiment of the invention is a full color flat panel display that comprises many 

pixels, each pixel comprising at least three different microcavity emitters. Other 
contemplated embodiments are a LED printer, an optical interconnect and an optical 

fiber communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to light emitting
devices.Optical microcavities are resonators that have at least one dimension
(herein typically the effective optical length of the cavity) on the order of a single (or
at most a small number, e.g., 2 or 3) optical wavelength(s). It has been recognized
that such resonators not only are interesting for fundamental research purposes but
also hold technological promise for constructing novel kinds of light emitting
devices. See, for instance, H. Yokoyama, Science, Vol. 256, pp. 66-70, which inter
alia discloses a microcavity structure that contains a dye solution (FIG. 6). See also
Y. Yamamoto et al., Physics Today pp. 66-73, June 1993. Possible applications of
microresonator light emitting devices are, for instance, in the fields of flat panel
displays, optical interconnects, optical fiber communications and LED printing.At least some technological fields (e.g., color flat panel displays) require
an array of light sources, some of which emit light of one color and some of another.
Typically, such arrays are tricolor, e.g., red, green and blue, in order to achieve full
color capability. In one exemplary known type of three-color flat panel display, an
LED display, this is achieved through provision of three different types of LED.
See, for instance, K. Murata, DisplayDevices, pp. 47-50, 1992.Although the prior art knows flat panel LED color displays, the known
LED displays are not entirely satisfactory, as evidenced by the fact that such displays
are not yet widely used. For instance, prior art displays typically are difficult to
manufacture. Thus, a new type of LED color display that is potentially easy to
manufacture would be of considerable interest. This application inter alia discloses a
novel multicolor array of light sources that can advantageously be used in, e.g., a
color display that potentially can be more readily and economically manufactured
than some prior art color displays.It is known that a microcavity device that comprises an organic thin film
sandwiched between two mirrors can have interesting optical properties. See, for
instance, N. Takada et al., Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 63(15), pp. 2032-2034, and
T. Nakayama et al., Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 63(5), pp. 594-595,
August 2, 1993. The latter inter alia discloses significant narrowing of the
electroluminescence (EL) spectrum of a 50 nm thick tris (8-hydroxyquinolinol)
aluminum (Alq) layer between two appropriately spaced mirrors, as compared to 
such a film that is not between two mirrors.
