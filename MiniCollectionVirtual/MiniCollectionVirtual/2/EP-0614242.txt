<ABSTRACT>
A filter,particularly suitable for radio frequency applications 
comprises a first filter which, in turn, comprises at least a 

pair of intercoupled resonators (RES1,RES2),and a SAW filter 
(SAW) which is coupled between the two intercoupled resonators 

so that a signal input to the filter at its input (IN) is 
coupled through the SAW filter to provide an output signal at 

its output (OUT).This provides a filter with all the advantages 
of a SAW filter,but with the ability to withstand the high 

power requirements of radio frequency applications.If three or 
more resonators are present in the first filter,then an 

amplifier can also be integrated in the filter.The SAW filter 
(and the amplifier if present) are inductively or capacitively 

coupled to the resonators depending upon the type of filter 
that is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter for providing an 
output signal at its output from an input signal input 
thereto, the output signal having a frequency in a predetermined 
frequency range, and the filter comprising a first filter 
comprising at least a pair of intercoupled resonators,and a 
SAW filter. The invention also relates to a radio transceiver 
incorporating such a filter. Generally speaking, a radio transmitter - receiver 
(transceiver),for example,as in a radio telephone requires a 
duplex filter when the same antenna is used for both 
transmission and reception. It is well known to persons 
skilled in the art to employ duplex filters,comprising 
resonators, in radio transceivers to prevent the transmission 
signal from travelling into the receiver and, likewise, the 
received signal from travelling into the transmitter.A duplex 
filter usually consists of two separate bandpass filters, one 
of which is connected to the receiver section of the 
transceiver, the mean frequency and bandwidth thereof 
corresponding to the reception frequency band, and the other 
filter being connected to the transmitter section of the 
transceiver,the mean frequency and bandwidth thereof being 
equivalent to the transmission frequency band. The other ends 
of the filters are frequently connected to a common-antenna 
line via a transmission line matching the impedance. Duplex filter designs are commercially available for a 
plurality of different transceiver circuit designs and are 
usually composed of helical filters, dielectric filters, or the 
like. As the size and price of radio telephones goes down,  
 
there is a need to provide, not only smaller and less expensive 
circuit elements, such as semicon-ductors, but also to 
implement smaller and less expensive duplex filters. The 
helical and dielectric filters acquire most of the space within 
a radio transceiver although endeavours have been made to make 
them more and more compact. In radio telephone technology, filters based on surface 
acoustic wave resonators have been in use for some time. These 
are often called surface acoustic wave or SAW filters. An 
advantage of these SAW filters is not only their small size but 
also the precision with which they can be reproduced in 
manufacturer. The part of the component accommodating the 
surface wave phenomenon, in itself, is an interdigital 
converter, consisting of interdigital electrodes arranged in 
comb-like fashion on a piezoelectric substrate.An electrical 
voltage between the electrodes
