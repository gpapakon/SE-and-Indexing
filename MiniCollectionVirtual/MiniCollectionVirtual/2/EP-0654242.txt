<ABSTRACT>
For a tub (11) which provides access through a 
side door (70), an inflatable seal (27) is employed with 

the fluid connection to the seal (27) being provided 
through the door hinge structure. Sensors (46, 47) are 

provided in conjunction with the water level in the tub so 
as to activate the source of pressurized fluid to the seal 

as well as to deflate the seal at a desired time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bathing structures having
a side wall door to facilitate access. More particularly
it relates to a system for inflating and deflating an
inflatable seal for the door.Bathtubs with side doors are known. A key problem
with such tubs is sealing the door when water is in the
tub. Caskets were therefore placed around the doorway.
For example, see US-A-3,423,769 and US-A-3,863,275. In
the former patent, a seal is disposed on the doorway edge
and connected by a tube in the structure forming the
doorway. In the latter patent, a seal is attached to a
door with a source of air in the door.In providing air inflatable seals for such doors, it
is desirable to have the inflatable seal placed on the
door itself (rather than the doorway structure) so that
it is not exposed to contact as a person enters or exits
through the doorway of the bathing structure. Also, for
aesthetic and other reasons, to minimize vandalism and
for safety reasons, it is desired to conceal the supply
tube which delivers air or another fluid (e.g. liquid) to
such an inflatable seal. This is a problem as air
compressors cannot easily be placed in the door and
because the door must pivot.CH-A-319156 discloses a pivotable door provided at
its outer edge with an inflatable seal, there being 
conduit means disposed on the hinge structure for
providing fluid to the inflatable seal.EP-A-0457093 having an earlier priority date but
published after the priority date of the present
application relates to a tub having a door with an
inflatable seal.It is therefore a principal object of the invention
to provide an improved system for inflating and deflating
an inflatable tub seal for a side wall door in a bathing
structure.The present invention provides a system for
inflating and deflating a fluid inflatable seal in a door
which closes a doorway in a tub having an enclosure
defined by at least one side wall, a bottom wall and an
upwardly open interior cavity with said doorway in said
side wall,
said system
being characterized by sensor means for sensing the level
of water in said cavity,
means to inflate said inflatable seal being operatively
connected to said sensor means, means being operatively associated
with said sensor means to deflate said seal when the
level of water in said cavity is below a predetermined
level,
said means to deflate said seal being
operatively connected with a timing
circuitry to remain actuated for only a predetermined
time.The foregoing and other features and advantages of
the invention will appear in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system for inflating and deflating a fluid
inflatable seal (27) in a door (10) which closes a

doorway (18) in a tub (11) having an enclosure defined by
at least one side wall, a bottom wall and an upwardly

open interior cavity with said doorway in said side wall,
said system

being characterized by sensor means (46,47) for sensing
the level of water in said cavity,

means (40,42,62) to inflate said inflatable seal (27) being
operatively connected to said sensor means (46,47),

means (52,59) being
operatively associated with said sensor means (46,47) to deflate

said seal (27) when the level of water in said cavity is below
a predetermined level,

said means (52,59) to deflate said seal (27) being
operatively connected with

a timing circuitry (53) to remain actuated for only a
predetermined time.
The system of claim 1, characterized in that
said sensor means (46,47) is constructed and arranged

with respect to said means (40,42,62;52,59) to inflate and deflate said
inflatable seal (27) so that said seal (27) remains inflated when

there is at least a predetermined level of water in said
tub (11).
The system of claim 1, characterized by pressure
responsive means (55) operatively connected to said means (40,42,62)

to inflate said inflatable seal (27) to stop inflation of said
seal (27) at a predetermined point.
