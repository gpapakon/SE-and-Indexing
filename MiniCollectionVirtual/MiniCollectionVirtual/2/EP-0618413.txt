<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus (10) for prechilling tap 
water by using a heat exchanger (40) to provide a path 

of flow for the warm tap water fed into an ice maker 
machine (10) and another path for the cold waste water 

(54) ejected by the machine by means of which heat can 
be transferred through walls separating the fluids. The 

prechilling is achieved by using an insulated, elongated 
casing (12) having top and bottom ends (18,16) forming 

there between a closed reservoir (14) housing the heat 
exchanger (40) made of copper tubing (46) or the like. 

The heat exchanger is in the form of a coil (50) 

followed by a substantially straight tube (44) within 
and surrounded by the coil's turns 52). A 

heat-insulating hollow member (58), which is closed at 
one end (60), is spaced from the straight tube (44) to 

be surrounded by the turns (52) and to form between the 
hollow member (58) and the straight tube (44) an 

elongated chamber (64) whose bottom (59) is open to the 
interior of the reservoir (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and 
apparatus for prechilling the warm drinking (tap)-water, 
fed into an ice maker machine to make ice cubes and the 
like, with the near freezing waste water ejected by the 
machine. Ice making machines are now widely used, especially 
in warm climates. They consume considerable energy some 
of which is unnecessarily and needlessly wasted. In the U.S.A., ice makers are certified and rated 
in accordance with American Refrigeration Institute 
(ARI) Standard 810-91. Test conditions for standard 
ratings are 32.22°C (90°F) ambient air, 21.11°C (70°F) 
tap water, and about 2.1 kg/cm2 (30 psig) water inlet 
pressure. In most ice makers, and as a byproduct of the ice 
making process, a considerable volume of unused nearly 
1°C cold waste water is now being dumped into the sewer, 
even though it had long been suggested to use this cold 
waste water for prechilling the tap water flowing into 
the machine, as will now be described in more detail. The lower the tap water's temperature is, the 
higher will be the output (harvest) of ice from the 
machine during each cycle of ice production. Lowering tap water's temperature by about 10°C can 
considerably increase the machine's ice output. A drop 
of 15°C in the summer would be most desirable and would 
produce benefits including: savings on the amount of 
required floor space for the ice maker, on its cost and 
installation, and on its operating and maintenance 
expenses. Workers in this ice making art had striven to 
arrive at practical water chilling methods and devices. U.S. patent 2,775,100, issued on Dec. 25, 1956, 
very briefly suggests to prechill the tap water with the  
 
cold waste water. "As the water is discharged from the 
tank, it proceeds to a receiver 40 where it is passed in 
heat exchange relation with the water being supplied" by 
pipe 11 (Col. 4, lns. 26-29). U.S. patent 4,338,794 shows an ice maker which 
prechills the tap water as well as the freon using two 
copper coils within two chambers of a casing. The tap 
water flows throuah one coil in one chamber, and the 
freon flows in the other coil in an adjacent chamber. 
Cold waste water flows through both chambers. U.S. patent 2,403,272 shows a water cooler having a 
refrigeration system using freon, a compressor and 
evaporator for cooling drinking water. The evaporator 
consists of a tank 1 in which a first coil 9 surrounds a 
second coil 8. Coil 8 is inside a pipe 11 whose bottom 
end opens to the interior of tank 1 and whose top end 
has a
