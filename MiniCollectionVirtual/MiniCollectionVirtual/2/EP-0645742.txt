<ABSTRACT>
The cash safe (1) has a safe operating unit (7) to be operated selectively by two cashiers (4a, 4b), with only a single banknote output (11) and input (39) unit. The dispensing orifice of the banknote output unit (11) can be closed by means of a two-part cover (13a, 13b). For dispensing banknotes, only that orifice part adjacent to the respective cashier (4a, 4b) is opened in each case. This results in a perfect allocation of the cash sum supplied for one of the two bank employees. Even if there is carelessness, the second bank employee cannot take hold of the banknote bundle supplied for the first bank employee. Preferably, the safe operating unit (7) can be removed from the safe base unit (15) of the cash safe (1), the safe base unit (15) containing a banknote store. The top side of the safe base unit (15) adjacent to the safe operating unit (7) is completely closed, with the exception of a narrow slot, through which the banknotes can be dispensed from or introduced into the banknote store. That is to say, with the safe operating unit (7) removed, there is sufficient protection against unauthorised access to the banknote store. For a choice of routes of the banknotes from banknote input unit (39) to the banknote store or to the banknote dispensing unit (11) or from the banknote store to the banknote dispensing unit (11), a bar-shaped route selection element rotatable about its longitudinal axis is used. The route selection element is pierced at least with a longitudinal slot. An input orifice of an input unit (39) for banknotes can be closed by means of a swing-open cover (57). A lever of a two-armed lever arrangement is arranged on the cover. By means of the lever arrangement, a banknote pressure plate for pressing the banknotes down in order to separate them can be pressed onto a bearing plate. During the pressing-down operation, the banknote pressure plate is movable parallel to the surface of the bearing plate by the lever arrangement as a result of the closing of the cover.

<CLAIMS>
A cashier's safe (1) having a safe operating unit (7) with only a single banknote dispensing
unit (11) for selective use by two cashiers (4a, 4b), and a banknote receiving unit (39),

characterised by the banknote dispensing unit (11) having a two-part cover (13a, 13b) by
which a dispensing opening thereof can be closed, and, for dispensing banknotes, only the

opening part of the banknote dispensing unit (11) can be uncovered by that one of the cover
parts (13a, 13b) of the two-part cover which is adjacent to the relevant cashier (4a, 4b) using

the cashier's safe at the time.
A cashier's safe (1) according to claim 1, characterised in that the dispensing unit (11) is
arranged on the upper side of the cashier's safe (1) and can be used by the cashiers (4a, 4b)

from top left or top right.
A cashier's safe (1) according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the dispensing opening
of the dispensing unit (11) is constructed in the form of a horizontally extending, preferably

trapezoidal, elongate opening with open sides.
A cashier's safe (1) according to claim 3, characterised in that the covers (13a, 13b) are
displaceable horizontally and transversely relative to the elongate opening and have a recess

corresponding to the cross-section of the elongate opening.
A cashier's safe (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the safe
operating unit (7) is removable, preferably without the use of tools, from the safe base

unit (15) of the cashier's safe (1), which base unit (15) contains a banknote store (35), and the
upper side of the safe base unit (15), adjacent to the safe operating unit (7), is completely

closed except for at least one slot which is so narrow that only single banknotes can be
conveyed therethrough from or to the banknote store (35).
A cashier's safe (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by a bar-shaped
route-selecting element (41) which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis (43) and through 

which at least one longitudinal slot (45a, 45b) extends so that the banknotes can be conveyed
selectively, when coming from a banknote receiving unit (39), in a direction towards the

banknote store (35) in the safe base unit (15) or towards the dispensing opening of the
dispensing unit (11) or, when coming from the banknote store (35), towards the dispensing

opening.
A cashier's safe (1) according to claim 6, characterised by two longitudinal slots (45a, 45b)
which are brought together to form in cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (43)

of the route-selecting element (41) a curved "V" and which, preferably, have a funnel-shaped
inlet.
A cashier's safe (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by a hinged
cover (57) for closing the receiving opening of the receiving unit (39), a support plate (84)

against which, when the cover (57) is closed, the banknotes can be pressed, after insertion, for
separation by a two-armed lever arrangement (63, 67) one lever (63) of which is mounted on

the cover (57); a banknote pressing plate (79) for pressing the banknotes together, and at least
one guide element (91) for the banknote pressing plate (79) with which the banknote pressing

plate (79) can be guided at right angles to the support plate (84) during closing of the cover.
