<ABSTRACT>
Amplification oligonucleotides and 
hybridization assay probes are provided which distinguish 

Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 from other viruses 
found in human blood tissues. 
The probes are nucleotide polymers which 
hybridize to the nucleic acid region of Human 

Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 corresponding to bases 763-793 
of HIV type 1, (HXB2 isolate GenBank accession number 

KO3455), or any of the regions corresponding to bases 1271-1301, 
1358-1387, 1464-1489, 1501-1540, 1813-1845, 2969-2999, 

3125-3161, 4148-4170,4804-4832, 5950-5978, 9496-9523, 
510-542 and 624-651.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the design and
construction of amplification oligonucleotides and probes
to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV), which allow
detection of the organism in a test sample.Laboratory diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
Type 1 in humans is currently performed by demonstration of
the presence of viral antigen (p24) or anti-HIV-1
antibodies in serum. Direct detection of viral DNA,
however, is a more useful diagnostic tool in some
populations, such as infants born to seropositive mothers.
Detection of viral DNA is more rapid and less hazardous
than culture. Direct hybridization lacks adequate
sensitivity in most patients (Shaw et al. Science 226:
1165-1171, 1984). Many references mention oligonucleotides
said to have use in detection of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus. Most of these references also mention the use of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These references include
