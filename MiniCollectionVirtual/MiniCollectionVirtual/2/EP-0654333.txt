<ABSTRACT>
The machine has a rotating tool (3) above a support for the workpiece to be worked, and a lower tool (4) for working the underside of the workpiece. To support the workpiece during the working, provision is made for a pressure device. The latter has a pressure element (28) in front of the lower tool (4) and a pressure element (36) behind the lower tool (4). During the working by the lower tool (4), both pressure elements (28, 36) press the workpiece upwards against a supporting element (24). Since the pressure elements (28, 36) are provided underneath the workpiece, they can also serve at the same time as a support for the workpiece during the working. Working with a high degree of accuracy can thus be achieved.
