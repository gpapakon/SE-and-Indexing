<ABSTRACT>
A catalytically active, truncated human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7) is 
provided. The truncated human CYP7 can be made recombinantly and thus 

recovered in relatively large amounts. Vectors and host cells for recombinant 
expression are provided, as well as an antibody which specifically recognizes an 

epitope of catalytically active, truncated human CYP7. Also provided is a method 
for screening a compound for its effect on expression of non-truncated human 

CYP7, and a method for screening a compound for its effect on non-truncated 
human CYP7 enzyme activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
High serum cholesterol is commonly associated with an increased risk of heart
attack, atherosclerosis and circulatory disorders. In addition, a variety of diseases
are caused by cholesterol catabolism disorders, such as gallstone disease,
atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and some lipid storage diseases.The major pathway for disposal of cholesterol in the body is by secretion of
cholesterol and bile acids into the gut. Bile contains free cholesterol and bile acids.
The enzyme, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7) commits cholesterol to bile acid
synthesis and catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis in the
liver. Specifically, CYP7 catalyzes, in the presence of reductase and a reducing
agent such as NADPH, the initial hydroxylation of cholesterol at the 7α-position,
thereby forming 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, by increasing synthesis of bile acids,
this enzyme plays a key role in the liver by depleting hepatic cholesterol pools,
resulting in increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and a lowering of serum
cholesterol levels.Bile acids are physiological agents which are important in the solubilization of lipid-soluble
vitamins, sterol and xenobiotics. Bile acids are synthesized exclusively in
the liver and are secreted to the intestines where they are modified to secondary
bile acids. Most bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and recirculated to the
hepatocytes via the portal vein. The feedback of bile into the liver is known to inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
and thus inhibit the overall rate of bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase,
therefore, has been a subject of active investigations to elucidate the regulatory
mechanisms of bile acid synthesis in the liver.It is known that an interruption of bile acid reabsorption, such as that caused by the
bile sequestrant, cholestyramine, or by a bile fistula, stimulates the rate of bile acid
synthesis and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver. Recent achievements
in the purification and cloning of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase cDNA have advanced
knowledge about the regulation of this enzyme at the molecular level. It has
become clear that cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver is regulated
primarily at the gene transcriptional level by bile acids, cholesterol, hormones,
diurnal rhythm and other factors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
the regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene expression remains
undetermined.To understand the structure and function of human CYP7 and its regulation by
