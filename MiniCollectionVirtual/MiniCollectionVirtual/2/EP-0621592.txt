<ABSTRACT>
A magnetooptical recording medium for information 
recording and information reproduction includes plural 

thin films, including at least a reproducing layer and 
a recording layer, laminated on a substrate. The 

reproducing layer is composed of a magnetic thin film 
which assumes a horizontally magnetized state at room 

temperature but assumes a vertically magnetized state 
above a predetermined temperature higher than the room 

temperature. The magnetization in the horizontally 
magnetized state is free from vertical orientation, 

including the magnetic wall. The recording layer is 
composed of a magnetic thin film which assumes a 

vertically magnetized state at room temperature and 
above the predetermined temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical
recording medium for effecting information recording
and reproduction with laser light, a method for
producing the recording medium, and a method for
recording or reproducing information in or from the
recording medium.For rewritable high-density information
recording, keen interest is being paid to the
magnetooptical recording medium in which information is
recorded by forming a magnetic domain in a thin
magnetic film with thermal energy of semiconductor
laser and is reproduced by the magnetooptical effect,
and, more recently, there is an increase in demand for
increasing the recording density of such magnetooptical
recording medium to attain a further increased
recording capacity.The linear recording density of an optical disk,
such as the magnetooptical recording medium, is
principally determined by the S/N ratio of the
reproducing layer, and is significantly dependent on 
the frequency of the signal bit train, the wavelength
of the laser employed in the reproducing optical
system, and the numerical aperture of the objective
lens.More specifically, once the wavelength λ of the
laser of the reproducing optical system and the
numerical aperture NA of the objective lens are given,
the bit frequency f of the detection limit is
determined by the following equation:
f = λ/2NAOn the other hand, the track density is
principally limited by the crosstalk, which is
principally determined by the distribution (profile) of
the laser beam on the medium surface and can also be
represented by a function of (λ/2NA) as in the case of
the bit frequency mentioned above. Consequently, for
achieving a higher density in the conventional optical
disk, it is necessary to shorten the wavelength of the
laser in the reproducing optical system and to increase
the numerical aperture NA of the objective lens.However, there are certain limits in such
reduction of the wavelength of the laser and increase
in the numerical aperture. EP-A-0 509 836 discloses an optical recording medium
in which the recording layer has a magnetization
perpendicular to the layer and the reproducing layer has
a magnetization parallel to the layer in a temperature
range up to a predetermined temperature and a
magnetization perpendicular to the layer at temperatures
greater than the predetermined temperature. During
reproduction, only those parts of the medium which are
heated by the reproducing light spot above the
predetermined temperature will produce a measurable
magneto-optic signal.In consideration of
