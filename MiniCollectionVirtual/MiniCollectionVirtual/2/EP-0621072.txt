<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a demineralization 
apparatus comprising a diluting chamber 
packed with a cloth. Particularly, it relates to an 
improvement in a demineralization apparatus utilizing 
electrodialysis action. As a method of producing demineralized water, an ion 
exchange resin method which comprises passing water to be 
treated through an ion exchange resin-packed bed, 
regenerating a deteriorated ion exchange resin with an acid 
or alkali regenerant and then using the regenerated resin 
repeatingly has been used generally. However, the method 
has a drawback in that a regeneration process for the ion 
exchange resin by using regenerant like hydrochloric acid 
or caustic soda is troublesome and, in addition, a great 
amount of alkaline and acidic waste water is discharged. 
Accordingly, a process for producing demineralized water 
without using the regenerant has been demanded. For such a demand, a demineralization method 
comprising an ion exchange resin and an ion exchange 
membrane in combination has been proposed in recent years. 
Based on the fact that water-containing ion exchange resins 
are good electric conductors, an electrodialysis action 
using anion and cation exchange membranes as diaphragms is 
utilized in this method. In this method, ion exchange 
resins as a filler are filled or packed in a diluting  
 
chamber of an electrodialysis unit defined with an anion 
exchange membrane and a cation exchange membrane, and water 
to be treated flows through the diluting chamber under 
application of a voltage, and the treated water is obtained 
as demineralized water. During processing of this method, impurity ions in 
water to be treated is subjected to ion exchange by the ion 
exchange resin, impurity ions captured by the ion exchange 
resin are eluted by supply of electric current, the eluted 
impurity ions are separated by the ion exchange membranes. 
Demineralized water is produced while conducting ion 
exchange by the ion exchange resin and regeneration thereof 
simultaneously. In this way, according to a so-called 
electrodemineralization method of producing demineralised 
water by using the ion exchange membrane and the granular 
ion exchange resin as the filler, it requires neither the 
regeneration operation for the granular ion exchange resin 
nor use of regenerant of acid or alkali for regeneration. 
Therefore, it can be considered as an advantageous method. However, the apparatus used for the known electrodemineralization 
method described above has a drawback that
