<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for the purification of waste water 
containing a silver compound, comprising the steps of (1) adding to 

said waste water a salt of a poly(guanidine) or poly(biguanidine) 
polymer (2) adding a flocculant, and (3) filtrating the formed 

flocculate. 
The invention is particularly suitable for the removal of silver 
from the effluent of a photographic processor, and more specifically 

the effluent of a processor of wash-off materials, said effluent 

also containing gelatin. 
A most preferred poly(guanidine) compound is 
poly(hexamethyleneguanidine) hydrochloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the purification
of waste water, and more particularly for the removal of silver from
the effluent of a photographic processor, said effluent also
containing gelatin.For simplicity's sake, the terms "silver" or "silver compound"
are both used for the set of all forms of silver present in
solution, e.g. free silver ions and complexed silver ions, e.g.
silver thiosulphate complex or silver thiocyanate complex, colloidal
silver, etc.Processes for the recovery of silver in the photographic
industry are well known. The techniques which are most widely used
for the removal and recovery of silver from spent photographic
solutions are electrolysis on the one hand, which is most often used
in the particular case of silver recovery from spent silver-rich
photographic fixing solutions, and the use of ion-exchange columns
on the other hand. A survey of methods on silver recovery can be
found in Journal of Imaging Technology Vol. 11, No. 2, April 1985,
pp. 43-50. In the same issue of this jounal on pp. 51-58 the use of
ion-exchange techniques is reviewed. In the technique of
electrolysis the recovered fixing solutions are usually
subsequentely reused, not discarded. On the contrary the technique
of electrolysis is not used to recover silver from photographic
solutions which are to be finally discarded, because it fails in
almost all cases to yield effluents that are into compliance with
anti-pollution regulations. The technique of using ion-exchange
resins on the other hand has the disadvantage that it cannot be used
when substantial amounts of gelatin are present in the photographic
waste water, because of either clogging of the ion-exchange column
and/or the development of disagreeable odours when gelatin fractions
deteriorate on the ion-exchange column. These problems are increased
when recovery of silver is attempted from processor effluent in
instances where a wash-off type film is used, i.e. a film where
development of an image involves washing-off the unhardened parts of
the emulsion layer containing silver halide and gelatin by means of 
e.g. a spray of hot water. In many of those cases water rich in
silver will be flushed down at substantial rates into the sewerage,
often in violation of the local pollution control laws.It is the object of the present invention to provide an
inexpensive, easily implementable process for the removal of silver
from waste water, more particularly from the effluent of a processor
of photographic material, said process being

<CLAIMS>
Process for the purification of waste water containing silver,
comprising the steps of (1) adding to said waste water a salt of

a poly(guanidine) polymer or poly(biguanidine) polymer
corresponding to general formula (I) or (II) :



wherein L represents a divalent aliphatic or aromatic, linear,
branched or cyclic linking group, X
-
 represent an anion, and n
is at least 5,

(2) adding a flocculant, and (3) filtrating the formed
flocculate.
Process according to claim 1 wherein said waste water containing
silver additionally contains gelatin.
Process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said waste water is
the effluent of a processor of photographic material.
Process according to claim 3 wherein said effluent emanates from
the processing of a wash-off type photographic material.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein said salt of a
poly(guanidine) polymer is poly(hexamethyleneguanidine)

hydrochloride or sulphate.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said
flocculant is a compound bearing at least one sulphonate or

sulphate group.
Process according to claims 6 wherein said flocculant is
polystyrene sulphonate or N-methyl-N-oleyl-taurine or a mixture

thereof.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 7 wherein a flocculation 
aid is added before the filtration step.
Process according to claim 8 wherein said flocculation aid is
high-molecular weight polyacrylamide or aluminium sulphate.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 9 wherein said
filtration step is performed by means of a band filter of fine

mesh filter fabric.
Process according to claim 10 wherein said filtration step is
performed in a continuous way by advancing said band filter from

a supply web at a rate sufficient to replace the used section of
the filter thus providing fresh filter fabric.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 11 wherein said process
comprises a subsequential step consisting of passing said

filtrate over an ion-exchange column.
