 Description"ORAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL IMMUNOGLOBULIN CONJUGATE"Background of the InventionThe present invention relates to an oral pharmaceutical composition containing a polyethylene glycol-im unoglobulin, particularly polyethylene glycol-immunoglobulin G (PEG-IgG) conjugate and to the oral administration of a PEG-Ig conjugate to patients with gastrointestinal secretory immunodeficiency to reconstitute secretory immunity.The components of the gastrointestinal immune system consist of lymphoid tissues concentrated in Peyer's patches, intraepithelial lymphocytes, phagocytic cells, antibodies, and complement components. Secretory IgA is the major antibody in the gastrointestinal system. It differs from serum IgA by the presence of two additional polypeptide chains, a J chain and a secretory component. Because of this additional structure, secretory IgA resists proteolytic digestion.Secretory immune deficiency is a commonly encountered disorder that arises from a variety of congenital, physiologic, or pathologic mechanisms.Infants normally have secretory IgA deficiency since IgA is produced in only very low amounts for the first few months of life. (This condition is remedied when the infants receive their mother's milk which contains secretory IgA.) Additionally, patients with selective IgA deficiency or common variable immunodeficiency also have a deficiency of IgA. Patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation suffer the destruction of 

 IgA producing plasma cells resulting in secondary secretory IgA deficiency. Further instances of acquired persistent secretory IgA deficiency occur, e.g., in bone marrow transplant recipients, and in acquired immunodeficiency due to HIV infection.As is apparent from the effectiveness of mother's milk in overcoming secretory IgA deficiency in infants, oral administration of the antibody can provide therapeutic advantages. Human milk, and especially human colostrum, might provide the ideal form of immunoglobulin for oral use, but there are major difficulties in the procurement, preparation, sterilization, and standardization of this substance. In addition, there is the possibility that banked breast milk could transmit viral infections.A few studies have been done to assess the oral use of commercially available pooled human serum immunoglobulin to reconstitute secretory immunity (see Table 1) . While these studies report some success, the stability of serum immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract is questionable because of

2. An oral pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterized in that the serum immunoglobulin in the conjugate is immunoglobulin G.
3. An oral pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterized in that the serum im uno- globulin in the conjugate is immunoglobulin A.
4. A composition according to claims 1-3, characterized in that from 6.0% to 27% of the available lysines of the immunoglobulin are modified by the polyethylene glycol.
5. A composition according to claims 1-4 characterized in that the composition is formed into a capsule or a tablet.
6. A composition according to claims 1-4, characterized in that the oral carrier is an aqueous liquid containing a flavorant component.
