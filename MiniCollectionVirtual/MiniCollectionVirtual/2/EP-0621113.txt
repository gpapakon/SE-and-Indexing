<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stripping apparatus
for a paperboard and a method of stripping the same, and
more particularly to an apparatus for and a method of
stripping a paperboard having a blank and a waste punched
therein.In order to fabricate a box from a paperboard, the
paperboard is firstly cut in a predetermined pattern to
provide a developed form of the box to be obtained. Such a
cutting operation is performed with a plural number of
paperboards superposed and the paperboards are cut while
remaining joint portions between a blank and a waste of each
of the paperboards at appropriate positions so as to prevent
separation at this stage. The wastes are thereafter
separated from the blanks.Such separation of the wastes from the blanks are
normally manually performed by an operator. In case of mass
production, a stripping apparatus is used for separation and
includes a pair of upper and lower dies and a press machine 
on which the dies are mounted.However, in case of manual separation, the operator is
required to sever the joint portions by means of a hammer or
like tools. Therefore, such a manual separation involves
the problem that the operation is very fatiguing for the
operator and that the operation cannot be efficiently
performed. A known Apparatus for continous pushing out of sheet product
from blank ( US-A-3 964 655) comprises a pair of first
and second base plates movable toward and away from each
other. At each base plate pressing pins are inserted in
support holes. The blank and the waste of the paperboard
are separated through abutment of said pressing pins
fixed within the support holes of the first base plate in the
area corresponding to the blank and through abutment of said
pressing pins fixed within the support holes of the second base
plate in the area corresponding to the waste 
when
said first and second base plates are moved each other with
the paperboard interposed therebetween. On the other hand, in case of separation by the
stripping apparatus having the upper and lower dies, it
involves the problem that much costs are required for
manufacturing the dies and that the dies must be replaced by
new ones whenever the cutting pattern of the paperboards is
changed. In the Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 6, no. 267 (M-182)
JP-A-57 160 522 an upper mold for skimming is disclosed.
The upper mold is provided in the form of a base plate disposed in facing
relationship to a lower mold and is movable towards and away therefrom
in the vertical direction. The base plate includes
