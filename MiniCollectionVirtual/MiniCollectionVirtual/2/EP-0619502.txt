<ABSTRACT>
A scanning optical rangefinder is claimed including an optical scanner and 
a light source (10). The optical scanner includes a rotating disc (20) with 

a circular array of concave reflectors (18) thereon. Mirrors are provided 
for directing light from the light source towards the concave reflectors 

(18) on the scan disc (20) towards a target. Light received from the target 
is directed towards the concave reflectors (18) on the scan disc (20) by 

mirrors along a plurality of channels. A detector adapted to receive light 

reflected from the concave reflectors is provided for each channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems for providing range and lateral position
data on targets. More particularly, the invention relates to systems for
simultaneously providing range and lateral position data on targets for
collision avoidance. In addition, scene reflectance data is acquired
for each pixel and form the basis for creating an ordinary scene image.Typically, a target, or multiple targets, lies within a field of view which
is rectangular in shape. The position of a target within the field of view
may be defined by its angular coordinates, α and β, corresponding, respectively,
to the azimuth (horizontal) and elevation (vertical) directions. In
an extreme case, each image cell or pixel within the field of view lies at
a different range. It is, therefore, desirable to create a "3D map" of a
scene by assigning a range value to each pixel within the field of view.There are different methods for obtaining this range information. One
method is to use the principle of triangulation wherein the range of a target
is derived from knowledge of the directions of the lines of sight from
two viewing points to the target. This is a well known and widely used
rangefinding technique for single targets. However, where multiple targets
are spread over a large field of view, the complexity of the problem can
become excessive, particularly, if the "3D map" must be created and analyzed
quickly. A further problem is that a large field of view and high
resolution requirements can dictate the use of an imaging detector with a
prohibitively large size and large number of elements and high cost as
shown below.Fig. 7 illustrates the application of conventional rangefinding concepts to
target location. A target is located at distance R from the viewing points
separated by distance W and generates an angle δ in the case where the target
lies on a axis that bisects the line connecting the two viewing points.If the angle δ can be measured and the distance W is known, then the range
R is given by
R = W/δ
for small angles δ, (e.g., less than 10°). For an off-axis target at angle
α, illustrated in Fig. 8, the range is given by
R = W cosα/δFor off-axis angles of 15° or less, equation (1) is sufficient for greater
than 95% accuracy.Referring to Fig. 9, in order to resolve range differences, a certain angular
resolution dδ is required. This is related to range resolution dR by
∂δ = W/R2 ∂RReferring to Fig. 10 and again applying conventional rangefinding techniques,
the two viewing points may comprise, for example, a pair of cameras
