<ABSTRACT>
A bag (1) to receive a respective article is formed by a front (6) and a central sheet section (7). Furthermore, with the rear sheet section (8), the central sheet section (7) forms an auxiliary bag (2). When the safety bag is sent by post, a rigid supporting panel (3) is inserted in the auxiliary bag (2) in order to give the safety bag a prescribed stability. The supporting panel (3) is not necessary when the bag is transported by a person. A folded-back flap (12) which adjoins the rear sheet section (8) at the top extends into the gap between the upper end regions of the front (6) and of the central sheet section (7) and prevents the article to be introduced from passing into the auxiliary bag (2). The safety bag is closed at the top by an adhesive strip (13) which connects the front sheet section (6) to the flap (12). At the bottom of the safety bag, there is an attachment (4,4) in the same plane, which serves to receive a confirmation of receipt or a franking stamp and, if appropriate, a postage stamp.

Limp safety bag with measures for an indication 
of an unauthorised manipulation of same and with 

at least one pocket section (1) for the receipt of a 
ware, characterized by at least one auxiliary pocket (2) 

located adjacent the pocket section (1) and at least one 
planar supporting member (3) which is resistant against 

bending and warping and selectively insertable into a 
respective auxiliary pocket (2), and by one sheet like 

attachment (4, 5) adjacent the at least one pocket 
section (1) for receipt of acknowledgement receipts. 
Safety bag according to claim 1 with one 
pocket section (1) and one auxiliary pocket (2), 

characterized by a front (6), centre (7) and rear sheet 
section (8), whereby the pocket section (1) is formed by 

the front (6) and the centre (7)sheet sections and the 
auxiliary pocket (2) is formed by the centre (7) and the 

rear (8) sheet section, which sheet sections (6,7,8) are 
interconnected at a end area (9), the front (6) and centre 

sheet section (7) comprise a free edge (10 and 11, 
resp.) at the respective opposite end areas and the rear 

sheet section (8) comprises at the opposite end area a 
folded back flap (12) projecting into the interstice between 

the front (6) and the centre (7) sheet sections. 
Safety bag according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the front sheet section (6) is shorter 

than the centre sheet section (7), such that the free 
edge (10) of the front sheet section (6) is arranged 

staggered relative to the corresponding edge (11) of the 
centre sheet section (7) towards the interconnected edge 

areas (9).  
 
Safety bag according to one of the 
claims 2 and 3, characterized in that a section (14) of a 

strip (13) carrying an adhesive (13) is connected to the 
front section (6) at an area (16) located of a distance 

aside of the free edge (10), such that the front sheet 
section (6) comprises a projecting area (17) which is not 

connected to the strip (13) carrying an adhesive (15), 
whereby the adhesive (15) of the portion of the adhesive 

strip which is not connected to the front sheet section 
(6) is covered by a peelable covering strip (18), such 

that for a closing of the safety bag after a remoting of 
the covering strip (18) the adhesive strip portion is 

bondable onto the projecting area (17) of the front sheet 
section (6) and the folded back flap (12) of the rear 

sheet section (8) projecting between the front (6) and 
the centre sheet section (7). 
Safety bag according to one of the 
claims 2-4, characterized in that the folded back flap 

(12) comprises as an indication of an unauthorised manipulation 
an identification feature serving as measure 

and which is covered by the strip (13) when the bag is 
closed, which identification feature is repeated (19a) on 

an outer surface of the safety bag. 
Safety bag according to one of the claims 
2-5, characterized in that the sheet sections (6, 7, 8) 

are interconnected along their edges (20, 21, 22) with 
exception of the free edges (10, 11) and comprise along 

the interconnected edges (20, 21, 22) a visible safety 
imprint as further measure for an indication of an unauthorised 

manipulation.  
 
Safety bag according to one of the 
claims 1-6, characterized in that the sheet like attachment 

(4, 5) is connected to the pocket section (1) via a 
design rupture area(24).
