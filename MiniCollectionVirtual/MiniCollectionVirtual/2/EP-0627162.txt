<ABSTRACT>
A chemical barrier effective to irritate and repel molluscs contains an 
active ingredient formed of fatty acid salts of monocarboxylic acids having 

chain lengths ranging from 8 to 14 carbon atoms, coconut fatty acid, palm 
kernel fatty acid, and mixtures thereof. The barrier may be in the form of a 

solid or a gel-like material that is able to harden to a solid. A solid barrier may 
also be formed by providing a solid substrate coated with the active ingredient 

barrier composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and compositions for
protecting agricultural and horticultural land from damage and infestation by
molluscs.Terrestrial pulmonate gastropods, slugs and snails (collectively
molluscs) are significant plant pests that affect commercial agriculture,
horticulture and domestic gardens. These molluscs are omnivores and
consume large amounts of vegetative material during their daily foraging.
Consequently, they can seriously damage vegetable gardens and even plant
crops during all phases of the plant growing cycle. The degree of damage
they cause is dependent upon the activity and density of the molluscs and on
their feeding habits. Each species of mollusc has feeding preferences that
differ. For example, Arion Rufus (L.) prefers the Solanaceae and
Compositae, while Deroceras reticulatum (Müller) selects Leguminosae,
Cruciferae, Compositae, carrot roots, potato leaves and tubers, cereals and
seedlings. Arion hortensis Fér seeks out living plants, carrot roots, tubers and
bulbs. Control measures are necessary to ensure adequate protection of
growing plants from the destructive potential of molluscs.A wide variety of approaches have been attempted to control
and combat pests or molluscs. Perhaps the most common is the use of
poisonous compounds called molluscicides. Molluscicides can comprise a
variety of chemical compounds including table salt (NaCl), calcium arsenate,
copper sulfate and metaldehyde. Metaldehyde, synthesized by the
polymerization of acetaldehyde in suspension in ethanol in the presence of an
acidic catalyst, has become the most common molluscicide in commercial
use.A major drawback of most molluscicides is that they are
contact killers and that they have little effect if molluscs do not come into
direct physical contact with the molluscicide. Thus, if a sprayed molluscicide 
does not contact molluscs, or if molluscs migrate into an area after spraying,
the molluscicide typically does not affect the molluscs. This lack of residual
action is a major problem for many molluscicides.Metaldehyde, however, has the advantage of providing contact
toxicity as well as acting as an ingested toxin. As a result, this compound is
useful as a long lasting bait, serving to attract the molluscs and to kill them
after ingestion of the compound. Despite its high degree of effectiveness and
its commercial popularity, metaldehyde is toxic to higher mammals and is a
major, worldwide contributor to domestic animal poisoning.Mollusc control is also effected by mechanical trap devices.
