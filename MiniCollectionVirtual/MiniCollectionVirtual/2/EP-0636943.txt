<ABSTRACT>
An electrically conductive toner powder, the separate particles of which contain 
thermoplastic resin, additives conventional in toner powders, such as colouring 

constituents and possibly magnetically attractable material, and an electrically 
conductive protonised polyaniline complex. The protonised polyaniline complex 

preferably has an electrical conductivity of at least 1 S/cm. The conductive complex can 
be distributed over the volume of the toner particles or be present in a polymer-matrix at 

the surface of the toner particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a toner powder which in addition to a thermoplastic binder
and other additives conventional in toner powders, e.g. magnetically attractable
material and/or colouring constituents, contains as electrically conductive material a protonized polyaniline complex to give
the toner powder the required electrical conductivity so that it can be deposited on a
charge or potential pattern by inductive attraction.
In electrostatography and electrophotography it is known to form a visible image by
using electrically conductive toner powder having a resistivity of less than 1012 Ω.cm,
preferably between 104 and 109 Ω.cm, measured as described in Example 1 of
UK patent 1 406 983. Examples of image-forming processes in which such electrically
conductive toner powder is used will be found inter alia in the abovementioned
UK patent 1 406 983, European patent 0 310 209 and US patent 3 563 734.
Electrically conductive magnetically attractable toner powders can also be
advantageously used in magnetographic image-forming processes, as described inter
alia in US patent 5 154 944.
Electrically conductive toner powders usually consist of thermoplastic resin particles in
which additives, such as colouring constituents and possibly magnetically attractable
material, are present in finely divided or dissolved form and which contain electrically
conductive material distributed over the volume of the particles and/or applied to or just
beneath the surface of the particles. One electrically conductive material which is
frequently used is carbon, the carbon particles preferably being affixed to the surface of
the toner particles or being embedded completely or partially in the surface thereof. At
the same time the carbon particles act as colouring constituent. Examples of these toner
powders are described in UK patent 1 406 983 and US patent 3 639 245. For electrically
conductive coloured toner powders use is made of electrically conductive colourless
relatively transparent substances, for example tin oxide which, to increase the electrical
conductivity, is doped with antimony or fluorine. In this case too, the conductive
material is preferably deposited on the surface of the toner particles. See European
patent application 0 441 426.Deposition of the conductive powder material on the surface of the toner particles
has the advantage that relatively little material is required, usually not more than 8% by
weight, to achieve the required electrical conductivity.
In the preparation of the toner powder it is
