<ABSTRACT>
Blasting apparatus using abrasive media is provided having reduced 
floor space and improved accessibility for maintenance purposes. The 

invention provides a blasting apparatus (10) comprising a blast media 
storage hopper (12) integral with a collector compartment (13) for dust and 

other debris. The apparatus may comprise an integral cabinet (10) having 
a working compartment (11) with a perforated floor (26) above the storage 

hopper (12) and collector compartment (13) and abrasive media separation 
means (30) may be provided below floor (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blasting apparatus using abrasive media. Blasting apparatus conventionally comprises a housing such as a 
cabinet in which the workpiece to be blasted is bombarded with abrasive 
material, a supply hopper to contain the abrasive material, means to supply 
the abrasive material to the cabinet and a separate collector for the debris 
from the process. Such apparatus has problems of occupying a 
considerable space, need for interconnecting hoses and wires, and poor 
accessibility for maintenance purposes. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved blasting 
apparatus which can be more compact and more readily accessible for 
maintenance. It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved means 
of separating used abrasive material from dust and debris formed during 
the blasting process. Accordingly, the invention provides a blasting apparatus comprising 
a blast media storage hopper integral with a collector compartment for dust 
and other debris.  Conveniently the apparatus may be an integral cabinet having a 
working compartment to contain the workpiece to be blasted, the storage 
hopper and the collector compartment. Normally the working 
compartment will be above the storage hopper and collector compartment 
and will have a perforated floor through which used abrasive material and 
dust and other debris from the blasting process falls. The cabinet below the working compartment may be divided 
diagonally to provide the desired separate storage hopper and collector 
compartment. The working compartment may be provided with a viewing window, 
lighting, operator gauntlets and a blast gun as used conventionally. The means to supply the blast gun with abrasive material from the 
storage hopper may also be any conventionally used means. For example, 
a pneumatic device as described in our British Patent No. 1,412,693 may 
be used. This device employs a duplex tube in which the outer tube has an 
open lower end which is positioned beneath the surface of the abrasive 
material in the storage hopper and an inner tube having an open lower end 
spaced longitudinally inwards from the open lower end of the outer tube. 
A flow restrictor is positioned in the outer tube adjacent the lower end of 
the inner tube whereby when gas, e.g. air, is fed down the outer tube and 
then changes direction to travel up the inner tube, local turbulence is  
 
caused by the restrictor. The restriction also causes an increase in gas 
flow velocity whereby the overall effect is to

<CLAIMS>
A blasting apparatus (10) comprising a blast media storage hopper 
(12) and a collector compartment (13) for dust and other debris, 

characterised in that the storage hopper (12) and the collector 
compartment (13) are formed integrally. 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
apparatus comprises an integral cabinet (10) having a working 

compartment (11) to contain the workpiece to be blasted, the working 
compartment (11) being situated above the storage hopper (12) and the 

collector compartment (13). 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
cabinet (10) below the working compartment (11) is divi
ded by a diagonal 
wall (14) to provide the storage hopper (12) and the collector compartment 

(13). 
A blasting apparatus according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the working compartment (11) contains a blast gun 

(21) supplied with abrasive media from the hopper (12) by means of a 
duplex tube (23), the tube (23) having an outer tube with an open lower 

end to be positioned below the surface of the abrasive media, and an inner 
 

tube having an open lower end spaced inwardly from the open lower end 
of the outer tube, a flow restrictor being positioned in the outer tube 

adjacent the lower end of the inner tube. 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the floor (24) of the working compartment (11) is a perforated plate 

beneath which is located an abrasive media separation means (30) to allow 
abrasive media to fall into storage hopper (12) and to divert dust and other 

fine debris into the collector compartment (13). 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
abrasive media separation means (30) comprises an air flow and labyrinth 

baffle means (31, 32, 33, 34, 36) to divert the dust and other fine debris. 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that 
an inverted V-section plate (31) with its apex (32) uppermost extends 

beneath the floor (26) and the labyrinth baffle means is positioned 
underneath the apex (32). 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 7, in which a hollow tube 
(35) extends underneath the apex (32) of the plate (31) and is connected at 

one end to a dust collection bag (38) in collector compartment (13) and its 
other end opens inside the labyrinth baffle means (31, 32, 33, 34, 36) to 

receive the diverted dust. 
A blasting apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
baffle means comprises a substantially vertical plate (33) depending from 

the apex (32) and a substantially horizontal plate (34) extending from the
