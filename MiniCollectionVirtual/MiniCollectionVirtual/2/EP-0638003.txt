<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of liquid and solid sewage flows in a stream along a channel (2) in the direction from right to left as seen in the Figure. A screening apparatus includes an endless screening belt (4) located with its lower inlet region in the sewage stream. The belt (4) consists of pivotally connected screening elements (12) made of perforated plate. Each screening element (12) consists of a shorter part (14) and a longer part (16) connected at an acute angle to one another. In operation, the belt (4) travels anti-clockwise causing solid sewage greater than the size of the perforations to be carried upwardly on the shorter parts (14). The liquid sewage effluent drains from the screening elements (12) as they ascend. When each screening element (12) reaches the upper region of the belt (4) the screening element tilts in a clockwise direction to release the solid sewage which drops to a screw conveyor (30) which conveys the solid sewage to a desired location. The upper region (22) of the belt (4) extends upstream of the inlet region of the belt (4) so that any solid sewage spilt from the upper region of the belt (4) which is not collected by the screw conveyor (30) falls back into the channel (2) upstream of the inlet region of the belt (4). This arrangement reduces the risk of solid sewage entering and polluting the cleansed liquid sewage effluent downstream of the conveyor belt (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for removing 
solid materials from a liquid. The invention is 
particularly concerned with hut not restricted to an 
apparatus for removing solid sewage from a mixture of 
liquid and solid sewage during the purification of 
sewage. In a previously proposed sewage purification system the 
mixture of liquid and solid sewage travels along an open-topped 
channel to a conveyor screen arranged to lift the 
solid sewage out of the channel. This conveyor screen is 
in the form of an endless belt travelling between a lower 
region located in the channel and an upper region located 
above the channel. The direction of flow of the liquid and solid mixture 
along the channel, and the direction of travel of the 
conveyor screen belt are such that the ascending part of 
the conveyor screen belt may be inclined in the 
downstream direction for at least part of its travel 
between the upper and lower regions. The conveyor screen 
belt is arranged so that when solid sewage arrives at the 
upper region of the belt, the sewage falls off the belt 
and is collected in a transporter, such as a screw-conveyor, 
and transported to a required location A device of this 
type is known from the WO92/18221. A 
disadvantage of the known arrangement is that if any of 
the solid sewage falling off the conveyor screen belt 
should miss the transporter then this sewage will fall 
into the channel downstream of the conveyor screen belt 
thereby polluting the cleaner liquid effluent downstream 
of the conveyor. It is an aim of the invention to alleviate this  
 
disadvantage, and according to one aspect of the present 
invention there is provided apparatus for removing solid 
material from a liquid stream; said apparatus comprising 
screening means having an inlet region located in the 
stream to extract therefrom said solid material in a 
preselected size range, said screening means being 
operable to convey said extracted solid material to an 
outlet region, transporting means to receive solid 
material released from said outlet region and transport 
said solid material to a required location, in which the 
outlet region is located above and upstream of said inlet 
region whereby extracted solid material not collected by 
the transporting means returns to the stream upstream of 
the inlet region of the screening means. The screening means may be in the form of an endless 
belt, and in a preferred embodiment of the invention this 
belt may comprise a plurality of pivotally connected 
screening

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for removing solid material from a 
liquid stream, said apparatus comprising screening means (4) 

having an inlet region located in the stream to extract 
therefrom said solid material in a preselected size 

range, said screening means being operable to convey said 
extracted solid material to an outlet region, 

transporting means (30) to receive solid material 
released from said outlet region and transport this solid 

material to a required location, characterized in that the outlet 
region is located above and upstream of said inlet region 

whereby extracted solid material not collected by the 
transporting means (30) returns to the stream upstream of the 

inlet region of the screening means. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
screening means comprises an endless belt (4). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 in which the 
screening means comprises a plurality of pivotally 

connected screening elements (12) which are arranged 
longitudinally to one another. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 in which each 
screening element comprises two connected generally 

planar sections (14) and (16) which are located at an 
angle to one another. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 in 
which each screening element (12) is of sheet form with 

apertures therein. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 in 
which each screening element is made of woven or spaced  

 
elements. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 
6 including a chain (36) connected to the screening means 

(4) for movement therewith, and driving means (6) for 
driving the chain. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 in which links 
(38,40) of the chain are connected to associated pivotal 

connections (32) of the screening elements (12). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
including guide means (44) to maintain the required 

configuration of the screening means (4). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 9 including 
rollers (34) on the screening means (4) arranged to run 

on the guide means (44). 
A method of removing solid material from a 
liquid stream, said method comprising collecting said 

solid material on the inlet region of a conveyor screen (4) 
located in the stream, conveying said collected material 

to an outlet region of the conveyor screen for transfer 
to a transporting means (30), characterized in that the collected solid 

material is conveyed upwardly and in an upstream 
direction with respect to the conveyor screen inlet 

region whereby solid material accidentially or 
prematurely released from the conveyor screen outlet 

region re-enters the stream upstream of the conveyor 
screen inlet region.
