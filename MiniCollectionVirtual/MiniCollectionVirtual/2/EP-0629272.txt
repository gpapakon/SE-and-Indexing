<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pressure vessel (1) comprising at least one intermediate part (4) with an end wall (2, 3) connected to each of its ends (1A, 1B), and longitudinal internally reinforcing walls dividing said intermediate part (4) into fluid-accommodating compartments. The intermediate part (4) with enclosed reinforcing walls consists of an extruded profile with reinforcement and an intermediate part casing integrated with one another, and the respective end walls (2, 3) are capable of attachment by fastening means to the end of the respective intermediate part so that forces arising inside the vessel as a result of the internal overpressure against the respective end wall (2, 3) are distributed so that they act axially in the intermediate part (4), both in its outer casing and internal reinforcement. The invention also relates to a method for the manufacture of the pressure vessel in accordance with the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure 
vessel comprising at least one intermediate part with-an 
end wall connected to each of its ends, and longitudinal 
internally reinforcing walls dividing said intermediate 
part into fluid-accommodating compartments. Pressure vessels of the kind indicated above 
have previously been manufactured in such a way that the 
maximum permissible internal pressure for the vessels has 
been determined in practice by the wall thickness of the 
vessel in question. It may be mentioned by way of example 
that compressed air apparatus, for example consisting of a 
face mask with a breathing valve and a vessel pack with a 
regulator unit, for example as illustrated in Fig. 1, is 
often of a specific size as regards the vessel pack. It is 
consequently difficult to make a single size fit a large 
number of people of varying heights and physical builds. 
Because the vessel pack consists of a number of pressure 
vessels made of metal, it is heavy, when filled with air or 
some other breathing gas, for firefighters equipped with 
smoke respirators or divers, etc., to carry around on the 
back with other equipment. Similar problems are, of course, 
encountered with other types of pressure vessel or gas 
vessels intended for air or oxygen, etc., for example for 
use by the rescue and emergency services, or for industrial 
gases. The negative effect of the relatively high own 
weight of the vessels is emphasized all the more in that an 
increasing number of pressure vessels is being incorporated 
into some form of transport system, where the transported 
weight is directly associated with a cost. The manufacture of pressure vessels of the air 
pressure tank type or similar at the present time involves 
the forming of a tube or a tube-like space with flat or 
dished end walls. In a design of this kind, as in all 
pressurized tubes without any internal reinforcement of the 
vessels, the tensile stresses acting peripherally around a  
 
cross-section of the tube section are at least twice as 
high as the tensile stresses axially in the cross-section. This means that the material in the tube walls 
is utilized to less than half its capacity in the axial 
sense because the design of the construction concentrates 
the load peripherally. If the design can be modified so 
that an optimized balance is achieved between axial and 
peripheral stresses, a material with only half the strength 
can be used. Alternatively, vessels with half the material 
content, and thus half the weight, can be
