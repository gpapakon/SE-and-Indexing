<ABSTRACT>
An elastic blade is used in a developing device
for controlling the amount of a developing agent (or a

thickness of a developing agent fed onto a developing
sleeve). The blade has on its surface an electrifying

layer formed out of a specific polyamide elastomer.
The polyamide elastomer is comprised preferably of a

block copolymer of polyamide and polyester.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastic blade for controlling the amount of feed of a developing agent (hereinafter referred to as a "developer") for developing and visualizing an electrostatic latent image formed on an image-holding member, and also to a development device employing the elastic blade.Known development devices, as shown in Fig. 4, comprise a developer-bearing member 3 (hereinafter referred to occasionally as a "development sleeve") which is attached to a development vessel 2 at a small distance to an electrophotographic photosensitive member 1, an elastic blade 7 for controlling the amount of the feed of a developer (hereinafter simply referred to as an "elastic blade"), an elastic roller 5, and a one-component developer 6 (hereinafter referred to also as a "toner"). The elastic blade is brought into contact with the development sleeve to control the thickness of the toner layer delivered to the development section. A thin toner layer is formed on a development sleeve by allowing the toner to pass through the contacting portion between the elastic blade and the development sleeve, and simultaneously given electrification (triboelectricity) for developing latent images by the friction at the contacting portion.Such an elastic blade includes ones constituted of a rubber plate, a metal thin plate, a thin plastic plate, or a laminate thereof.For a positive type toner; the elastic blade is used which is formed by laminating an electric charge-imparting layer (hereinafter referred to as an "electrifying layer"), such as a charge-controlled silicone rubber, onto a thin plate, such as a metal plate, as a supporting layer.For a negative type toner containing magnetite, a urethane rubber sheet is used which has been subjected to charge control treatment.On the other hand, a low-temperature melting toner (sharp-melting toner) which is used in view of energy saving involves a problem that the toner tends to become fusion-bonded to the development blade to cause defective image formation. This problem can be solved by decreasing the contact pressure between the development blade and the development sleeve. At the lower contact pressure, however, the development blade should have a surface layer having higher triboelectrification ability at lower contact pressure.United States Patent No. 4,673,631 discloses a triboelectrically chargeable composition for use in the development of electrostatic latent images. The charge controlling compound may be carried or dispersed in a polyamide resin and may
