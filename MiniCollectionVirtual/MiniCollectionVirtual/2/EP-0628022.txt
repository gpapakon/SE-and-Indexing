<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of
polyisobutyl hydroxyaromatics. More particularly, this
invention relates to a process for the preparation of
polyisobutyl hydroxyaromatics which comprises alkylating a
hydroxyaromatic compound with a polyisobutene having a
methylvinylidene isomer content of at least 70%.Alkylation of hydroxyaromatic compounds with polymeric
olefins using acidic catalysts to generate alkylphenols is
well known in the art. However, use of the acidic catalysts
required for the alkylation reaction gives rise to
concurrent polymer degradation and fragmentation of the
polymeric alkyl substituent on the hydroxyaromatic compound.
Known acidic alkylation catalysts have various fragmenting
effects depending on the size of the alkylating agent. Most
catalysts have little effect on olefin alkylating agents of
up to about 20 carbon atoms, that is, having a number
average molecular weight of up to about 280, but severe
fragmentation occurs where alkylating agents of higher
molecular weights are used. Polymeric alkylating agents are
usually derived from propylene or butene and those comprised
primarily of polybutene are the most susceptible to
fragmentation during the alkylation reaction. When
polybutenes having a number average molecular weight of 300
or greater are used, molecular weight degradation of either
the olefin polymer or the substituted alkyl group occurs.British Patent No. 1,159,368 discloses that fragmentation of
both the alkylating agent and alkyl substituent can be
reduced but not eliminated by the use of certain specified 
reaction conditions. These conditions include the use of
boron trifluoride-phenolate as the acidic catalyst and a
temperature range of 0°C to 65°C, with 0.1 to 1.1 moles of
boron trifluoride and 1 to 4 moles of phenol per mole of
mono-olefinic polymeric alkylating agent having a molecular
weight of 700 to 300,000. Under these conditions, the
fragmentation of polybutene can still only be restricted at
best to a level of about a 10% reduction of average
molecular weight.U.S. Patent No. 4,238,628 to Cahill et al. discloses a
process to reduce the molecular weight degradation during
the alkylation of benzene, phenol and naphthol which
comprises alkylating the aromatic compound in the presence
of a boron trifluoride catalyst with a C3 or higher olefin
polymer having terminal ethylene units.According to the Cahill et al. process, the olefin polymer,
preferably polybutene, is first reacted with ethylene to
provide a polymer having terminal ethylene
