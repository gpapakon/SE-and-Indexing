<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of production of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) 
by fermentation of bacteria, especially bacteria transformed with an expression vector for 
SAM synthetase, expression vectors which can be used for said production, bacterial strains 
transformed with said vectors, and a method of producing said strains. SAM is a naturally occurring molecule, widely distributed throughout body tissues and 
fluids. It plays a central role in three main metabolic pathways, such as transmethylation, 
transsulphuration and aminopropylation. Through methylation, SAM regulates liver membrane 
lipid composition and fluidity, whereas by activating the transsulphuration pathway, it 
favors endogenous detoxifying processes. The enzymatic machinery required for the synthesis of SAM is ubiquitous and occurs in 
almost all cells. SAM is synthesized from ATP and methionine, a reaction catalyzed by the 
enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAM synthetase, EC 2.5.1.6, Cantano, G. L. J. 
Biol. Chem. 1953, 204: 403-416). SAM ist currently used in medical and pharmacological areas due to its therapeutic potential 
in liver damage and affective disorders. A variety of clinical and experimental studies has 
demonstrated the ability of SAM to prevent or ameliorate the hepatotoxic effects of several 
drugs and chemicals (Friedel H. A. et al., Drugs 1989, 38: 389-416; Corrales et al., Drug 
Invest. 1992, 4, Suppl. 4: 8-13), to treat intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (Frezza, M. 
et al., Hepatogastroenterology 1990, 37: 122-125) and to improve clinical symptoms in 
cholestatic patients with chronic liver disease (Frezza, M. et al., Hepatology 1987, 7: 1105; 
Frezza, M. et al., Gastroenterology 1990, 99: 211-215). SAM has also been successfully 
used as an antidepressant (Baldessarini, R. J. et al., Am. J. Med. 1987, 83 suppl. 5A: 95-103; 
Bell, K. M. et al., Am. J. Psychiat. 1988, 145: 1110-1114; Chawla, R. K. et al., Drugs 
1990, 40 suppl. 3: 98-110). Increased therapeutic use of SAM has been made possible by 
the availability of a stable salt. However, the efficiency of the current methods of obtaining 
SAM is still low, despite attempts to produce it by enzymatic methods and/or conventional 
fermentation (Gross, A. et al., Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1983, 8: 415-422; Shiozaki, S. 
et al., Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984, 48: 2293). Shiomi et al. described the use of selected yeast 
strains which accumulated SAM for the production of the compound (Biotechnology & 
Bioengineering 1990, 35: 1120-1124). The
