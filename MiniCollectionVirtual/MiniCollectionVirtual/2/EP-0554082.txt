<ABSTRACT>
An expandable, balloon-catheter-delivered intra-vascular 
stent (10), especially adapted for cardiovascular 

applications, having a plurality of protrusions (15) on its 
outer surface for engaging the artery walls in which it 

is disposed. The protrusions are formed from the body of 
the stent in a unitary, one-piece manner. Apertures (20) are 

formed in the stent body from the space vacated in the 
body by the material forming the protrusions. When the 

stent is expanded by the balloon catheter, the protrusions 
engage both the apertures and the artery walls, 

to lock the stent into the expanded diameter. In this 
way axial displacement and radial collapse of the stent 

is avoided. The protrusions are arranged in a plurality 
of shapes, sizes and patterns. The stent may be made of 

a bioabsorbable material and/or a therapeutic drug 
delivery material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
expandable endoprosthesis devices, in particular 
expandable intraluminal vascular grafts, generally called 
stents, which are adapted to be implanted into a 
patient's lumen, such as a blood vessel, to maintain the 
patency of the vessel. These devices are frequently used 
in the treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis in blood 
vessels, especially after percutaneous transluminal 
coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, to prevent 
restenosis of a blood vessel. The present invention also 
relates to an expandable intraluminal vascular graft that 
can be used in any body lumen, and can be used for drug 
delivery. In expandable stents that are delivered with 
expandable catheters, such as balloon catheters, the 
stents are positioned over the balloon portion of the 
catheter and expanded from a reduced diameter to an 
enlarged diameter greater than or equal to the artery 
wall, by inflating the balloon. Stents of this type can 
be expanded and held in an enlarged diameter by 
deformation of the stent (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,733,665 
to Palmaz), by engagement of the stent walls with respect 
to one another (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,740,207 to 
Kreamer; U.S. Patent No. 4,877,030 to Beck et al.; and 
U.S. Patent No. 5,007,926 to Derbyshire 
on which the first part of claim 1 is based), 
and by one-way 
engagement of the stent walls together with endothelial 
growth into the stent (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,059,211 to 
Stack et al.).  
 According to the present invention there is provided 
an expandable intraluminal stent implantable in a 
vessel, comprising: a body portion; a plurality of 
protrusions, said protrusions projecting from said 
body portion; and a plurality of apertures in said 
body portion, several of said protrusions engaging 
said apertures and several of said protrusions, 
engaging said vessel to retain said intraluminal stent 
with respect thereto, characterised in that the 
protrusions are cut away from the body portion, the 
parts of the body portion thus removed defining the 
apertures. Preferred embodiments of the present invention 
provide a stent that is capable of localized 
therapeutic drug delivery. Still other preferred embodiments of the present invention 
provide a stent that is bioabsorbable. These and other embodiments of the invention will 
become more apparent from the following detailed 
description thereof when taken in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of one embodiment 
of the present
