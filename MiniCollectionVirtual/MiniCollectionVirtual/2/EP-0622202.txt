<ABSTRACT>
A process for start up of a thermal ink-jet printhead 
cartridge (C1, C2, C3, C4) includes a sequence of nozzle 

clearing procedures of increasing severity which are performed 
in sequence so long as some of the nozzles of the printhead 

fail to fire ink drops pursuant to ink firing pulses provided 
to the printhead or until all of the procedures have been 

performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is generally directed to thermal
ink-jet printers, and more particularly to techniques for
achieving reliable start up operation of thermal ink-jet
pens.An ink-jet printer forms a printed image by printing
a pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear
array. The locations are sometimes "dot locations,"
"dot positions," or "pixels". Thus, the printing operation
can be viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot locations
with dots of ink.Ink-jet printers print dots by ejecting very small
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include
a movable carriage that supports one or more printheads
each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses
over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are
controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times
pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller,
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is
intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the
image being printed. US patent 5184147 discloses an inkjet printhead cleaning and maintenance system
comprised in a printer. When the power of the printer is turned on if the temperature of
the inkjet printhead is smaller than an idle temperature a purge cycle is performed on
the printhead, followed by a wipe cycle and by an air knife cycle. Subsequently, a test
print is run and a user visually determines if the test print is satisfactory. If not, a clean
control button, may be depressed by the user to perform one or more additional
cleaning cycles. An important consideration with thermal ink-jet
printers is improper operation due to clogged nozzles,
particularly upon start up of a print operation after a
printhead has not been used for some time. The presence of
clogged nozzles prior to start up of a print operation
cannot be visually detected, and thus the presence of
clogged nozzles would be manifested by a bad printer
output, which is wasteful since the subject matter intended
to be printed would have to be printed again and moreover
since the clogged nozzles would not necessarily have been
cleared prior to the repeat print.It would therefore be an advantage to provide an
automatic thermal ink-jet printhead cartridge start up
procedure for detecting clogged nozzles of a printhead
cartridge prior to the start of a printing operation and
clearing any detected clogged nozzles.The foregoing and other advantages are provided

<CLAIMS>
A method for clearing non-operational nozzles of a thermal inkjet printhead when mounted
in a printer comprising a carriage that is movable along a carriage scan axis and

supports said printhead for printing onto a print media, the printhead having a
plurality of inkjet nozzles and heater resistors respectively associated therewith, the method comprising the step of:

executing a sequence of nozzle clearing procedures, said clearing procedures being
so ordered in said sequence that a first clearing procedure, being damaging to the

printhead, is executed before a second clearing procedure, being more damaging
to the printhead; the execution of said second clearing procedure is determined by

a previous step of optically testing each nozzle to determine whether it is non-operational.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of executing a sequence of nozzle clearing
procedures comprises the steps of:


(A) performing said first clearing procedure on the printhead cartridge;
(B) optically testing each nozzle to determine whether it is non-operational;
(C) if any nozzles are determined to be non-operational pursuant to the optical testing
performed in step (B), performing the second clearing procedure.
The method of claim 2, further comprising the step of

(D) repeating step (B), and
(E) if any nozzles are determined to be non-operational pursuant to the optical testing
performed in step (D), performing a third clearing procedure that is more damaging to

the printhead cartridge than the second clearing procedure.
The method of any preceding claims wherein,
the first clearing procedure includes the step of driving each of the heater resistors

with a first predetermined number of clearing pulses. 
The method of any of Claims 2 to 4 wherein the second
clearing procedure includes the step of driving each of the

heater resistors with a second predetermined number of
clearing pulses which is greater than the first predetermined

number of clearing pulses.
The method of any of Claims 3 to 5 wherein the third
clearing procedure includes the steps of:


priming the printhead; and
driving each of the heater resistors with a
plurality of clearing pulses.
The method of any of Claims 3 to 5 wherein the third
clearing procedure includes the steps of:


priming the printhead;
wiping the nozzle array of the printhead; and
driving each of the heater resistors with a
plurality of clearing pulses.
The method of any preceding claims further comprising the step of

   (A) before executing said first clearing procedure checking whether the temperature of the
printhead is at least as high as a predetermined

clearing temperature, warming the printhead to the
predetermined clearing temperature if necessary, and

driving each of the heater resistors with a first
predetermined number of clearing pulses. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein the step of optically
testing each nozzle includes the steps of:


(a) applying an ink firing test pulse to the
heater resistor of the nozzle;
(b) optically detecting whether an ink drop was

produced by the nozzle pursuant to the ink firing
test pulse;
(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) until one of the
following conditions occurs:


(1) steps (a) and (b) have been repeated M
times, where M is a non-zero integer; or
(2) N drops have been detected pursuant to
step (b) where N is a non-zero integer that is

less than M;
(d) designating the nozzle as (i) an operational
nozzle if the repetition of steps (a) and (b) is

stopped pursuant to the detection of N drops, or (ii) an
non-operational nozzle otherwise.
The method of Claim 7 wherein the integer M is 2
times the integer N.
