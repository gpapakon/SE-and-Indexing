<ABSTRACT>
A cage rotor (10) comprises a laminated core (14) fixed to a rotor shaft (12); a secondary conductor (18) arranged in a plurality 
of through holes (16) made through the laminated core (14); a pair of end rings (20) connected to the secondary conductor 

(18) at both ends of the laminated core (14) in the axial direction; and a pair of reinforcing members (22 and 23) covering the end 
rings (20) respectively. The secondary conductor (18) and end rings (20) are integrally formed by casting, and connected to the 

laminated core (14) and reinforcing members (22 and 23). The reinforcing members (22 and 23) are made up of annular elements 
made of a highly rigid material, and are provided with the cylindrical walls (26 and 27) enclosing the cylindrical outer periphery 

of the end rings (20), and the multi-hole walls (28 and 29) sandwiched between the respective end rings (20) and the laminated 
core and having a plurality of holes (32) communicating with the through holes (16) of the laminated core (14), and end walls (30 

and 31) which contact with the outer ends of the end rings (20) in the axial direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a squirrel-cage 
rotor for an induction motor, and more particularly to a 
squirrel-cage rotor for a high-speed induction motor 
which includes reinforcing members for preventing cast 
end rings from being deformed during high-speed rotation. Recently, in order to enhance the performance of a 
machine tool, a spindle motor for driving a spindle has 
been improved in the speed and power thereof. Some 
induction motors, commonly used as spindle motors, have 
squirrel-cage rotors which include secondary conductors 
and end rings both integrally formed with a laminated 
core by a casting process. When the speed of an 
induction motor having such a squirrel-cage rotor must be 
increased, there is a fear that end rings arranged at 
axial ends of a laminated core are bent or broken due to 
the centrifugal force caused by high-speed rotation. A 
known squirrel-cage rotor adaptable to high-speed 
rotation includes separate reinforcing members formed of 
high-rigid materials, such as iron or stainless steel, 
the reinforcing members being fixedly disposed on the 
rotor while surrounding the end rings, so as to eliminate 
the deformation of the end rings. Conventional reinforcing members for the end rings 
of a high-speed squirrel-cage rotor are formed as annular 
elements, each of which has a generally L-shaped 
cross-section at a circumferential region and includes a 
cylindrical wall coming into contact with the cylindrical 
outer circumferential surface of the end ring and an end 
wall coming into contact with the axial end surface of 
the end ring. The reinforcing member covers the surface 
of the end ring, and the end wall thereof is usually 
fixed to the axial end surface of the end ring by fixing  
 
means such as bolts. Therefore, the deformation of the 
end ring due to centrifugal force is prevented by the 
cylindrical wall of the reinforcing member. In the 
conventional reinforcing member, however, the cylindrical 
wall is supported through the end wall on the end ring in 
a cantilever manner, which causes problems that the 
cylindrical wall tends in itself to be bent outward due 
to centrifugal force in response to the increase of the 
diameter of the rotor or the rotation speed thereof, and 
thus fails to support the end ring. EP-A-0 341 317 discloses a 
squirrel-cage rotor for a high-speed 
induction motor, comprising: 
a rotor shaft; a laminated core made by stacking magnetic 
laminations, said laminated core being provided with a 
plurality of through holes extended
