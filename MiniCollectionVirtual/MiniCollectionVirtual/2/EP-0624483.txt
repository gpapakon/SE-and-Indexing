<ABSTRACT>
A writing instrument has an ink reservoir (22), a 
nib (24) and a feeder which temporarily stores ink which 

is pushed out of or pulled in the ink reservoir (22). 
The ink reservoir communicates with the nib through an 

ink supplying passage (28). The feeder chamber (26) 
communicates with the atmosphere through an atmosphere 

communicating passage (30) and with the ink reservoir 
(22) through a capillary flow passage (31). The cross-sectional 

area of the capillary flow passage (31) is 
small enough to hold ink in the capillary flow passage 

due to a surface tension of the ink. When the pressure 
in the ink reservoir (22) due to a temperature change, 

etc., ink flows in the feeder chamber (26) through the 
capillary flow passage (31) or is returned from the 

feeder chamber to the ink reservoir. Since the feeder 
chamber (26) is hollow, its volume is large and has a 

simple structure. Thus, the feeder can be manufactured 
easily. A low flow resistance of the capillary flow 

passage (31) provides good responsibility to compensation 
of a pressure change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a writing instrument 
provided with a hollow feeder chamber having a large 
capacity. In general, a writing instrument in which liquid 
ink is stored comprises an ink reservoir, a nib, an ink 
supplying passage for supplying ink from the ink reservoir 
to the nib, and a so-called feeder for compensating 
the pressure in the ink reservoir. The feeder communicates not only with the ink 
reservoir but also with the atmosphere. The feeder can 
hold a predetermined amount of ink. When ink in the ink 
reservoir is expanded or shrinks by a temperature change 
or the like, the pressure in the ink reservoir is 
retained constant by pushing the ink in the feeder or 
returning the ink from the feeder to the reservoir. 
As the ink in the ink reservoir is being consumed, an 
amount of air corresponding to the consumed amount of 
ink is introduced from the atmosphere to the ink reservoir 
through the feeder to maintain a constant pressure 
in the ink reservoir. As described above, the feeder is used to temporarily 
hold ink pushed out of the ink reservoir and return 
the ink to the interior of the ink reservoir. The 
conventional feeder holds ink by using capillarity.  
 FIGS. 1 to 3 shows a writing instrument which has a 
writing instrument body 1 provided with a conventional 
feeder 6. An ink reservoir 2 is formed in the writing 
instrument body 1, and a nib holder 3 is provided on the 
front end of the writing instrument 1. A nib 4 comprising 
a felt tip or the like is formed on the distal end 
of the nib holder 3. An ink supplying passage 5 for 
supplying ink from the ink reservoir 2 to the nib 4 
passes through the axis of the nib holder 3. In the proximal end portion of the nib holder 3 is 
provided the conventional feeder 6 which comprises a 
large number of thin disc-like flange portions 7 and a 
large number of annular narrow ink holding gaps 8 formed 
between the adjacent flange portions 7. In the proximal end portion of the nib holder 3 in 
which the flange portions 7 are formed is provided an 
axially continuously extending atmosphere communicating 
groove 9 having a front end communicating with the 
atmosphere. In the part of the proximal end portion of 
the nib holder 3 which is circumferentially separated 
by 180Â° from the atmosphere communicating groove 9 is 
formed an axially continuously extending ink conducting 
groove 10 having a rear end communicating with the ink 
reservoir 2. When the pressure in the ink reservoir 2 increases, 
ink is pushed out of the ink
