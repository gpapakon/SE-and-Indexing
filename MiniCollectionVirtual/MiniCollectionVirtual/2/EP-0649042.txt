<ABSTRACT>
A catoptric beam expander suitable for use with laser machining 
apparatus comprises a convex paraboloidal reflecting surface 7 and a 

concave paraboloidal reflecting surface 8 formed from a single metal 
element 10. The expander has an optional zoom facility 

provided by a plane mirror 12, moveable along an input-output 
axis, for altering the position of an incident beam on the 

convex surface 7 thereby altering the magnification of the 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a beam expander comprising two substantially
confocal, generally conic reflective surfaces for use for example to expand a laser
beam for laser machinery.EP-A-096,193 discloses a beam expander which includes two, separate
confocal mirrors, a first mirror being convex and a second one being concave.
These mirrors may be aspheres or other conic sections. The magnification of the
beam expander disclosed therein however, cannot be varied, i.e. there is no zoom
capability.US-A-3 950 079 discloses a catoptric system comprising a paraboloid
mirror P and an ellipsoid mirror E arranged such that the focus of the paraboloid
and one of the foci of the ellipsoid coincide. Means for adjusting the position
where the beam impinges onto the ellipsoid mirror such as to vary the aperture
and thus the magnification are provided, but both surfaces are not formed on a
single element.Furthermore EP-A-0 520 326 discloses a catoptric instrument comprising
conicoid mirrors at which light is subsequently reflected and have different
curvature and are arranged such that their focal points coincide, but again both
surfaces are disclosed as independent and not constructed from a single element.A catoptric system having a zoom capability is disclosed in US 4812030.
This Cassegrain arrangement achieves a variable magnification by moving the
powered reflectors with respect to one another.It is one object of this invention to provide a laser beam expander which can
be machined from a single element.It is a further object of this invention to provide a laser beam expander in
which a variable magnification (or zoom facility) can be provided by a means
which does not require movement of any powered optical element. In this specification the term conic is used to denote those curves forming
conic sections and the surfaces of revolution thereof, including convex and
concave parabolae and convex and concave ellipses, as well as toric
developments of such surfaces, and portions thereof.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an optical beam
expander comprising a first reflective conoid surface for receiving an optical beam
and reflecting it towards a confocal second reflective conoid surface thence to
reflect it onwards, in which one reflective surface is convex and the other is
concave, and characterised in that both reflective surfaces are formed on a single
element, and said system further comprises variable magnification means for
adjusting the position of the received optical beam on the first

<CLAIMS>
An optical beam expander comprising a first reflective
conoid surface (7) for receiving an optical beam (11) and

reflecting it towards a confocal second reflective
conoid surface (8) thence to reflect it onwards, in

which one reflective surface is convex and the other
is concave, and 
characterised in that
 both reflective
surfaces (7,8) are formed on a single element (10),

and said system further comprises variable
magnification means (12) for adjusting the position of the

received optical beam (11) on the first reflective surface
(7) thereby to adjust the magnification of said

expander.
An optical beam expander according to claim 1 in
which an intermediate region (9) of said single

element (10) between said first (7) and second (8)
reflective surfaces is locally thickened to enhance

heat transfer through said element.
An optical beam expander according to claims 1 or 2 in
which the variable magnification means comprises a

moveable plane mirror (12).
A beam expander according to any preceding claim in
which the first reflective surface is a convex

paraboloidal surface (7) and the second reflective
surface is a concave paraboloidal surface (8).
A beam expander according to any of claims 1 to 3 in
which the first reflective surface (17) is a convex 

toric paraboloid and the second (16) is a concentric
concave toric paraboloid.
A beam expander according to claim 5 in which the
curvatures of said reflective surfaces (16, 17) in the

tangential and sagittal sections differ, thereby
providing different magnifications.
A beam expander according to any of claims 1 to 3 in
