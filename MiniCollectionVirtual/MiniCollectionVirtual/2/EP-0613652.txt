<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation for 
connection to a sensor (1,43,49) comprises a convertor for converting 

the intensity of the 
received electromagnetic waves into electrical signals, a comparator for 

comparing the electrical signals with sets of predefined signals representative 
of certain places of application at the human body or representative of certain 

tissue characteristics and for selecting the set comprising most common 
characteristics with the electrical signals. Correction means correct the 

electrical signals in dependency of selected set. Further, a processor 
(47) calculates 

the oxygen saturation from the corrected electrical signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for performing non-invasive 
measurements of oxygen saturation based on the reflection technique. Oxygen saturation is a clinically very relevant parameter to assess the condition 
of a patient. Particularly in the operating room, the oxygen saturation of the 
blood gives an indication of the patient's condition, its supply with oxygen and 
other physiological factors. One possibility to obtain a very precise value of the patient's oxygen saturation 
is to take a blood sample and analyze it in a blood gas analyzer. Despite the 
high precision of this method, it is an invasive technique and this means that 
it cannot performed frequently, i.e. does not allow continuous monitoring. 
Therefore, significant changes in the oxygen saturation value may be missed. 
Last not least, it is understood that an invasive technique is not the preferred 
way to monitor a patient. It is therefore highly desirable to measure oxygen saturation non-invasively. 
This can be achieved by a technique called oximetry. An oximeter usually comprises two or more light sources of different wave 
length. The light is irradiated on human flesh, and either the intensity of the 
light transmitted through the flesh, or the intensity of the reflected light is 
measured. In more general terms, "light" does not only mean electromagnetic 
waves in the visible spectrum. For example, the most common oximeters use  
 
one wavelength in the visible spectrum and another wavelength in the infrared 
spectrum. The light transmitted or reflected by human flesh is attenuated according to 
Lambert-Beer's law, i.e. 
I = I0e-Ecl 
wherein I represents the intensity of the received light, I0 the intensity of the 
incident light, E the molecular extinction coefficient, c the concentration of the 
absorbing species and l the thickness of the absorbing layer, i.e. the length of 
the light path through tissue. If we assume that human tissue contains components with constant characteristics 
over time - such as bones, muscles etc. -, and components with time-varying 
characteristics - i.e. blood -, equation (1) yields 
In ( 1 IACIDC) = - Ec l(t)  
wherein IDC represents a component constant over time (caused by absorbers 
of constant absorbance), IAC represents the time-varying component (caused by 
blood) and l(t) represents the variation in thickness caused by arterial 
pulsations. This equation contains two unknown values, c and l(t). As oxygen saturation is defined as the quotient of the
