<ABSTRACT>
Object: To provide a method and an apparatus for 
automatic exchange of bobbins of a twisting or assembling 

machine. 
Construction: The empty bobbin (E) is kept in waiting 
near the winding (twisting or assembling) machine (2), the 

empty bobbin (E) and the full bobbin (B) are supported 
always with a predetermined horizontal distance (L) 

between them during the exchange process, and the full 
bobbin (B) is unmounted from the winding machine (2) and 

moved to the exchange work table (3), keeping the cable (1) 
always in stretched condition through out the exchange 

process. The stretched cable (1) is urged toward the 
inside surface of the flange of the empty bobbin (E) 

which is moved to follow the full bobbin (B) with the 
constant horizontal distance (L) therebetween, and, after 

the cable (1) is cut, one end thereof is fixed to the 
outer periphery of the full bobbin (B), while the other 

end is hooked and drawn outside the flange of the empty 
bobbin (E) for various characteristics tests .

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for automatic bobbin exchange in a cable-winding machine. In this specification the term "cable" includes an 
electric cable having one, two, three or more wires, 
whether twisted or not, and also includes a rope, strand, 
wire, ribbon, tape or cord, whether of metal or of 
natural or synthetic fibres, and whether multi-filamentary 
or mono-filamentary, and the term is to be 
broadly construed accordingly. There have been several previous proposals with 
regard to automatic bobbin exchange in a cable-winding 
machine. In the previous proposals for electric cable-winding 
machines, however, emphasis has been put on smooth 
transfer of the cut end of the cable from a full bobbin 
to an empty bobbin as a starting end for winding, and no 
attention has been paid to the fact that the starting end 
is soon buried under the bottom layer of wound cable, 
which results in a serious inconvenience in quality 
control such that it is impossible to make electrical 
continuity tests of the electric cable taken-up on the  
 
bobbin or to measure values of electrostatic coupling 
thereof. Furthermore, there has been a drawback in the 
previous proposals that, since there is no relationship 
between the positions wherein a full bobbin and an empty 
bobbin are held, the apparatus tends to be complex and 
expensive. The object of the invention is to solve the problems 
of the prior art stated above. According to a firat aspect of the invention, there 
is provided a method for automatic exchange of bobbins on 
which a cable is being, or is to be, wound, the method 
comprising the following steps:
 
   providing an empty second bobbin in a waiting or 
standby condition near a winding machine whereat the 
cable is being wound onto a first bobbin;
 
   removing the first bobbin when full from the winding 
machine and transferring said full bobbin to a changeover 
station or an exchange work table;
 
   keeping the cable in stretched condition during said 
transfer process;
 
   bringing the cable toward the inner surface of one of  
 
a pair of flanges of said empty bobbin that is moved to 
follow said full bobbin;
 
   cutting the cable and fixing one end thereof to the 
outer periphery of said full bobbin;
 
   hooking the cable and drawing out said cable to the 
outside of one of the flanges of said empty bobbin; and
 
   moving said empty bobbin downward as it is rotated so 
as to wind the cable thereon and then mounting said empty 
bobbin on said winding machine;

A method for automatic exchange of bobbins (B, E) on 
which a cable (1) is being, or is to be, wound, the 

method comprising the following steps: 
   providing an empty second bobbin (E) in a waiting or 

standby condition near a winding machine (2) whereat the 
cable (1) is being wound onto a first bobbin (B); 

   removing the first bobbin (B) when full from the 
winding machine (2) and transferring said full bobbin (B) 

to a changeover station or an exchange work table (3); 
   keeping the cable (1) in stretched condition during 

said transfer process; 
   bringing the cable (1) toward the inner surface of 

one of a pair of flanges of said empty bobbin (E) that is 
moved to follow said full bobbin (B); 

   cutting the cable (1) and fixing one end thereof to 
the outer periphery of said full bobbin (B); 

   hooking the cable (1) and drawing out said cable (1) 
to the outside of one of the flanges of said empty bobbin 

(E); and 
   moving said empty bobbin (E) downward as it is 

rotated so as to wind the cable (1) thereon and then
