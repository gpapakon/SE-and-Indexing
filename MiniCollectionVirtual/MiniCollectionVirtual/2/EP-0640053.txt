<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a corrugated fiberboard pallet (100) that includes a solid, multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard top member (110), a plurality of longitudinally extending multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard runners (120), a plurality of homogeneous multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard supports (130) and a plurality of longitudinally extending multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard rails (140). The top member has corrugations (115) extending in a first direction. The upper planar surface of each of the runners is affixed to the lower planar surface of the top member and corrugations (125) of each of which extend transverse to the first direction. The upper planar surface of each of the rails is affixed to the lower planar surface of respective ones of the runners. The corrugations (135) of each of the supports extend in one of the first direction and the direction transverse to the first direction. The rails each have an upper planar surface and a lower planar surface with the upper planar surface of each of which being affixed to a respective grouping of the supports and the corrugations (145) of each of which extending in the first direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CORRUGATED FIBERBOARD PALLETThis application is a continuation of copending design application, Serial No. 07/797,273, filed November 25, 1991.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of InventionThis invention generally relates to pallets and other devices used for goods and material handling, supporting, transporting and the like. More specifically, this invention relates to corrugated fiberboard pallets that are lightweight, inexpensive to manufacture, readily disposable, easy to recycle and able to be made water resistant.2. Description of the Related ArtFor many years, pallets have been used for the handling, supporting and transporting, for example, of goods and material. Traditionally, such pallets have been made from wood. Wooden pallets have wooden runners upon which boards are nailed or stapled to produce a deck on which goods are stacked or otherwise placed. The wooden runners elevate the deck above a floor or other supporting surface. This enables the tines of a forklift truck or other transport device to be inserted beneath the deck. Sometimes, the runners are notched to provide four-way entry of a forklift or a pallet jack.With the ever-increasing cost of lumber, wooden pallets have become expensive. The estimated dollar volume of new pallets produced in the United States in 1991, alone, was $4.4 billion for approximately 541 million new pallets 

produced. In order to justify their cost, wooden pallets must be used over and over again.Recent ecological efforts have placed an emphasis on reducing consumption of raw lumber. Such efforts also have placed an emphasis on the ability to recycle any products originally made from wood or lumber, for instance, as the raw material. However, due to their construction of heavy wood and nails, traditional wooden pallets are not readily recyclable and/or biodegradable.Recent estimates show that of the pallets produced in the United States in 1991, sixty percent were of the warehouse or returnable variety, while forty percent were of the expendable or single use variety. Accordingly, approximately 216 million of the wooden pallets produced in 1991 were shipped only one-way within the United States or overseas. It is estimated that 50 million pallets are shipped out of the country, one-way, each year.Wooden pallets themselves are also heavy, so that even a load of unloaded wooden pallets is not easily transported or handled. Rather, the weight of such pallets limits the number which may be stacked by a forklift or transported by a pallet jack. These

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A corrugated fiberboard pallet, comprising:
a solid, multiple-ply, corrugated fiberboard top member having an upper planar surface and a lower planar surface, corrugations of said multiple-ply top member extending in a first direction;
a plurality of longitudinally extending multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard runners each having an upper planar surface and a lower planar surface, the upper planar surface of each of which being affixed to the lower planar surface of said top member and corrugations of each of which extending in a direction transverse to the first direction;
a plurality of homogeneous, multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard supports each having an upper planar surface and a lower planar surface, of each of which being affixed to the lower planar surface of respective ones of said runners and corrugations of each of which extending in one of the first direction and the direction transverse to the first direction; and
a plurality of longitudinally extending multiple-ply corrugated fiberboard rails each having an upper planar surface and a lower planar surface, the upper planar surface of each of which being affixed to a respective grouping of said supports and corrugations of each of which extending in the first direction.
2. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein each of said top member, said runners, said supports and said rails is made of a material selected from a group consisting of multiple-ply corrugated paperboard, cardboard and fiberboard. 


3. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein each of said runners extends from end to end of said top supporting member.
4. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein said plurality of supports are arranged in a grid array, with spacing between each of said supports and the arrangement of said plurality of runners and rails allowing four-way entry of a transporting device.
5. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein respective elements of said pallet are affixed by gluing.
6. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein each of said plurality of runners and each of said plurality of rails are identical elements.
7. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein each of said plurality of supports has a common dimension with a respective one of said plurality of runners and a respective one of said plurality of rails.
8. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein the number of said plurality of supports equals the product of the number of said plurality of runners and the number of said plurality of rails.
9. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein the height of each of said plurality of supports is substantially equal to the height of said top member.
10. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein the height of each of said plurality of runners and said plurality of rails is substantially equal to twice the height of said top member. 


11. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein externally facing members of said pallet are coated with a water resistant material.
12. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein corrugations of each of said runners extend orthogonal to the corrugations of said top member.
13. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein the corrugations of each of said rails extend transverse to the corrugations of each of said runners.
14. The pallet according to claim 1, wherein the corrugations of each of said supports extend orthogonal to the corrugations of said top member.
