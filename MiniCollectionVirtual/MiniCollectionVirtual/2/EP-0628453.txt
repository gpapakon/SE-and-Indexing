<ABSTRACT>
Plug profile 10 made of plastic for mounting on a component 34, especially a motor vehicle component, includes at least one elongated plug profile wall 12, 14 and at least one contact web 22 which is moulded to the at least one plug profile wall 12, 14 and extends in the longitudinal direction of the plug profile wall 12, 14. The at least one contact web comprises a base region 24 which is moulded to the at least one plug profile wall 12, 14; a bending region 26 which adjoins the base region 24; and an end region 28 which adjoins the bending region 26 and has a contact surface 30 for contact with the component 34. The end region 28 points, when the bonding plug profile 10 is mounted on the component 34, in the direction opposite to the plug-in direction S of the plug profile 10 and rests against the component 34 via a contact adhesive element 32 which is arranged on the contact surface 30.
