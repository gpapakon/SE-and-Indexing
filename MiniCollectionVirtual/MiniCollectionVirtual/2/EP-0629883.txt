<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for substantially suppressing the undesired 
recoil derivative from the explosive discharge of high pressure gas from 

an air gun while still providing for useful optimised pressure pulses. A 
deflector (20) is coupled to the air gun so that a contact face (22) is 

located proximate one or more discharge portals (10) so that gas 
discharged interacts with the contact face.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to high pressure air guns
used in marine seismic exploration. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
substantially suppressing the undesired recoil derivative
from the explosive discharge of high pressure gas from air
guns while still providing for useful optimised pressure
pulses.In marine seismic exploration, a series of strong
acoustical pulses or waves are generated in the water.
These pulses rapidly pass through the water and the
geological formation are reflected to the surface for
recording and interpretation. There exist a number of
sources used in seismic exploration. One source that has
been proposed before is an air-gun as disclosed in EP-A-0,127,338.
This air-gun has a body with an air chamber
formed therein that opens 360° around the periphery of the
body. A sleeve-type shuttle covers the opening in a pre-fire
condition. When the air-gun is fired, the shuttle
moves rapidly away from the opening providing a large area
for compressed air held in the chamber to escape. The
movement of the shuttle is ultimately controlled by a
solenoid which, when activated, causes the shuttle to move
from the 360° opening, and when deactivated permits the
shuttle to move back into the pre-fire position over the
360° opening.The more popular seismic source is the air gun
produced by companies such as Bolt, Inc. or Haliburton 
Geophysical Services, Inc. and improved seismic sources
produced by Seismic Systems, Inc. such as those described
in U.S. 5,018,115.The air gun generally consists of an elongated
annular housing defining a cylindrical chamber which is
provided with a sealable port at one end and a shuttle
valve which is slidably disposed along the chamber axis.
When the shuttle is maintained in a first or "closed"
position air is pressurized within the chamber by a
sealable port defined thereby. When the shuttle is moved
to a second or "open" position, the pressurized air is
suddenly and explosively discharged into the water through
one or more discharge portal(s) formed opposite the
sealable port in the housing, which portal(s) communicate
with the surrounding water.When the pressurized gas is first released from the
sealable port and is still confined within the chamber, the
gas acquires a velocity parallel to the chamber walls, or
a direction parallel to the axis defined by the chamber
itself. In the vicinity of 
the sealable port, the cross-sectional flow area is at a minimum
and the gas typically reaches a velocity approximating the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for modifying the axial recoil
component of gas discharged incident to the operation of an

air gun, where said air gun comprises a housing(4), an
elongate chamber(6) for containing compressed gas formed in

said housing and defining an axis "A" and having a sealable
port(8), through which gas from the chamber(6) may flow

parallel to the axis "A" and one or more discharge
portals(10) through which high pressure gas released from

said sealable port is discharged outwardly into the water
at an angle which in the absence of a deflector would be β

defined with respect to said axis "A", characterised in
that a deflector(20) having a contact face(22) and an

attachment site(26) is provided, said deflector being
securely coupled to said air gun via said attachment site

such that said contact face is situated immediately
proximate said discharge portals and opposite said sealable

port such that gas discharged from said sealable port
physically interacts with said contact face, the angle of

inclination Θ of said contact face with respect to said
axis "A" being substantially equal to the sum 90° + β.
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said contact
face(22) is dispersed substantially perpendicular to said

flow of discharged gas.
The apparatus of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said
deflector(20) comprises a ring having an inner and an outer

diameter, where said inner diameter closely approximates
the outer diameter of said air gun housing(4).
The apparatus of Claim 3 wherein said inner
diameter of said ring is threadably receivable(26) to

threads(24) formed on the exterior of said housing. 
The apparatus of any one of the preceding Claims
where said housing(4) is made of stainless steel.
A method for modifying the axial recoil of an air-gun
having a housing(4), a chamber(6) and one or more

discharge portals(10), where said chamber defines an axis
"A" and where pressurised gas discharged from said portals

defines an angle β with respect to said axis "A",
characterised in that the method comprises deflecting the

pressurised gas exiting said discharge portals by a
plate(22) inclined at an angle Θ with respect to said axis

where Θ is substantially (90° + β).
