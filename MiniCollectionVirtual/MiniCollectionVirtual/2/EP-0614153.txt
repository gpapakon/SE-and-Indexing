<ABSTRACT>
A dual echo magnetic resonance imaging system produces two 
registered images of a patient in which the images have different contrast 

relationships between different tissue types. A two dimensional feature space 
histogram of the two images is produced and a separate centroid is located in 

the feature space histogram for a pair of tissue types. A Cartesian coordinate 
system is defined in the feature space so that one axis of the system passes 

through the two centroids. Vector decomposition is employed to project each 
image element data point in the feature space onto a point on the one axis. 

The fractional quantity of each tissue type present in the image element is 
determined based upon the Euclidean distances from that axis point to the 

respective centroids. The fractional quantity is calculated for each element in 
the original images to form a pair of tissue images. The elements of a tissue 

image are processed to measure the amount of that tissue type in the imaged 
portion of the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is image processing and more particularly,
to the processing of medical images, such as those acquired by magnetic
resonance, computed tomography or positron emission tomography, in
order to enhance features in the image.As the invention has particular application to magnetic resonance
imaging, it will be described in that context. Any nucleus of an atom which
possesses a magnetic moment attempts to align itself with the direction of
the magnetic field in which it is located. In doing so, however, the nucleus
precesses around this direction at a characteristic angular frequency (Larmor
frequency) which is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field and on
the properties of the specific nuclear species (the magnetogyric constant g of
the nucleus). Nuclei which exhibit this phenomena are referred to herein as
"spins".When a substance such as human tissue is subjected to a uniform
magnetic field (polarizing field B0), the individual magnetic moments of the
spins in the tissue attempt to align with this polarizing field, but precess
about it in random order at their characteristic Larmor frequency. A net
magnetic moment Mz is produced in the direction of the polarizing field, but
the randomly oriented magnetic components in the perpendicular, or
transverse, plane (x-y plane) cancel one another. If, however, the substance,
or tissue, is subjected to a magnetic field (excitation field B1) which is in the
x-y plane and which is near the Larmor frequency, the net aligned moment,
Mz, may be rotated, or "tipped", into the x-y plane to produce a net transverse
magnetic moment Mt, which is rotating, or spinning, in the x-y plane at the
Larmor frequency. The practical value of this phenomenon resides in the
signal which is emitted by the excited spins after the excitation signal B1 is
terminated. There are a wide variety of measurement sequences in which
this nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") phenomena is exploited.When utilizing NMR to produce images, a technique is employed to
obtain NMR signals from specific locations in the subject. Typically, the
region which is to be imaged (region of interest) is scanned by a sequence of
NMR measurement cycles which vary according to the particular
localization method being used. The resulting set of received NMR signals
are digitized and processed to reconstruct the image using one of many well 
knownreconstruction techniques. To perform such a scan, it is, of course, necessary
to elicit NMR signals from specific locations in the subject. This
