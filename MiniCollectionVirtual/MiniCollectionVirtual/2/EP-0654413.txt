<ABSTRACT>
A bottle packaging, comprising an essentially cylindrical bottle (1) and a wrapping (2) of cardboard material, in whose sleeve-like bottom part (4) of the packaging, which is open at the bottom, the bottle (1) is inserted securely and flush with the bottom. The top part (5) of the packaging engages over the bottle closure and is connected to the bottom part (4) of the packaging via a tear-open closure. The wrapping (2) consists of a cardboard blank which is bonded along a casing line to form a packaging sleeve (3) which tightly surrounds the bottle. A covering flap (7) which is connected to two opposite sleeve wall sections (3a,3b) engages over the bottle closure. The tear-open closure is designed as a line of weakness (6) in the cardboard material extending around the circumference of the packaging sleeve (3).

Bottle packaging consisting of an essentially cylindrical bottle (1) and an
outer packaging (2) made from board material, into the lower part of the

packaging (4) of which, which is sleeve-like and open at the base, the bottle
(1) is firmly inserted flush with the base and the upper part of the packaging

(5) of which overlaps the bottle closure and is connected to the lower part of
the packaging (4) by a pull-tab closure, characterised in that the outer

packaging (2) comprises a one-piece board blank which is glued along at
least two wall lines to produce a packaging sleeve (3) which tightly encloses

the bottle (1) and that a cover tab (7) which is connected to two opposite
sleeve wall sections (3a, 3b) overlaps the bottle closure and that the

packaging sleeve (3) comprises two blank pieces (8, 9) which are joined
together by the cover tab (7) to form a single piece, and which are joined

together in each case along two opposite longitudinal edges (10, 11).
Bottle packaging according to claim 1, characterised in that the pull-tab
closure is designed as a weakening line (6) in the board material running

around the circumference of the packaging sleeve (3).
Bottle packaging according to claim 1, characterised in that the packaging
sleeve (3) has several parallel fold lines (14) running along the wall lines.
Bottle packaging according to claim 1, characterised in that the width (B) of
the cover tab (7) is approximately the same as the diameter of the bottle, at

least in its middle area.
Bottle packaging according to claim 4, characterised in that the cover tab
(7) is tapered at its two folding ends which are connected to the sleeve wall

sections (3a, 3b).
Bottle packaging according to claim 1, characterised in that the bottle (1) is
glued to the packaging sleeve (2) in the area situated below the pull-tab

closure (6).
