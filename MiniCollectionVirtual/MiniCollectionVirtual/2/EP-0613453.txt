<ABSTRACT>
Removal of sodium values from sodium contaminated solids, such as red mud, is achieved by contact of a slurry of such solids with a particulate cation exchanger and occurs at an enhanced rate compared with water washing or washing with an acidic solution. Regeneration of sodium loaded resin occurs more efficiently with a mixed solution of sodium sulphate and an acid, such as sulphuric acid, than with a sulphuric acid solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF SODIUM VALUES FROM SODIUM CONTAMINATED SOLIDSThis invention relates to a process for the removal of sodium values from sodium contaminated solids, such as red mud.Industrial processes which utilise caustic soda and which produce sodium contaminated solid products or byproducts can give rise to significant environmental damage upon exposure of such contaminated solid products or byproducts to rain water or to ground water due to leaching of alkali. As an example of a process of this kind there can be mentioned the Bayer process for the production of alumina from bauxite which yields corresponding quantities of red mud. Another such process is the cleaning of coal with caustic soda in order to remove ash and sulphur therefrom.Red mud is the major waste product from the production of aluminium, being the residue remaining after leaching of bauxite by the Bayer process. In this process bauxite is heated under pressure with sodium hydroxide. The aluminium oxide reacts to form the aluminate ion which remains in solution. The solid impurities are removed by filtration and are known as red mud. Aluminium values in the sodium aluminate solution are reprecipitated upon cooling the filtered sodium aluminate solution by seeding with a crystal of alumina trihydrate: extraction A1203.3H20 + 2NaOH 2NaA102 + 4H20 (1). decomposition The resulting alumina trihydrate precipitate can then be calcined to yield alumina:A1203.3H20 > A1203 + 3H20 (2). calcination 

A description of the Bayer process can be found, for example, in "Non Ferrous Extractive Metallurgy in the United Kingdom", edited by . Ryan, published by The Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, London (1968) at pages 1 to 5 under the heading "Aluminium".Aluminium is the non-ferrous metal produced in largest quantity throughout the world. It is estimated that between 40 and 50 million tonnes per year of red mud are produced, essentially all of which is stored as landfill. It is also estimated that this quantity of red mud contains the equivalent of about 2 million tonnes of sodium hydroxide. The red mud is a mixture of oxides, such as those of iron, titanium and calcium, together with desilication products resulting from the Bayer leaching of the bauxite ore. Such desilication products are sodium alumino-silicates, or sodalites as they are alternatively called, which act as ion exchange compounds for sodium. As a consequence sodium slowly leaches from the red mud and produces a highly alkaline residue, typically having a pH of 12 or
