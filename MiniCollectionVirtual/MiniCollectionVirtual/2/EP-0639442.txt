<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of producing a stratiform 
article usable as an interior automotive panel. It includes the 

steps of injecting a molten thermoplastic polymer composition 

into a mold containing a preformed sheet, allowing the 
thermoplastic composition to solidify, and removing the 

solidified article, disposing a preformed contoured laminate 
insert in a female mold shaped in comformity with the outer 

cover of the insert and injecting a thermoplastic polymer 
composition into a mold, said polymer contacting the 

thermoplastic layer and interfusing therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates 
to a method of producing an essantially self-supporting stratiform article, 
typically a trim panel of the type used in the interior of automotive 
venicles such as vertical wall panels including door panels, comprising 
the steps as set forth in claim 1. Generally, trim panels for automobiles are composed of a substrate or 
base layer for mechanical strength and of an outer cover for visual appearance, 
feel, and/or comfort. Also, the outer cover frequently comprises more 
than one area with a specific or distinct color, texture, or resilience; 
for example, one or more vinyl-covered area(s) for resistance against soil 
and abrasion are combined with one or more, e.g. two to four areas covered 
with a textile such as carpeting, cloth or velvet, a foamed layer, man-made 
or natural leather for pleasing aopearance, comfort or soil resistance. Safe and easy placement of segments of cover stock cut in acoordance with 
the surface area(s) that is (are) to be provided with the particular cover 
layer, and - most importantly - in close register with one or more selected 
area(s), presents several problems some of which may need mutually exclusive 
solutions so as to require some compromise in the balance of properties. Most of the problems connected therewith tend to be aggravated by the 
fact that typical trim panels are "profiled", i.e. not essentially planar 
but shaped "three-dimensionally" to some extent so as to have a "depth" 
dimension in addition to having width and length. For example, protruding 
arm rests previously made as separate parts for subsequent mounting on a 
trim panel should be molded integrally with the panel to simplify production, 
and such arm rests, typically, require a specific surface structure,  
 
be it for comfort of use or for visual appearance. Additional problems are 
encountered when environmental requirements must be met, e.g. regarding 
disposal or recycling, or when some desired properties of a material defy 
meeting another requirement, e.g. the desirable toughness of polypropylene 
contrasted with its adhesive-repellant surface properties. Further, various 
aspects of the problems involved, such as structural integrity, ease of 
manufacture and off-set avoidance tend to increase, sometimes geometrically, 
with the number of the differing cover segments, e.g. more than two and up 
to eight or even ten. The art is replete with teachings of methods for making trim panels and the 
disclosure in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,781,966, 4,779,390,

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a stratiform article 
usable as an interior automotive panel, including the 

steps of injecting a molten thermoplastic polymer 
composition into a mold containing a preformed sheet, 

allowing the thermoplastic composition to solidify, and 
removing the solidified article, characterized by the 

steps of: 
   disposing a pre-formed, contoured laminate 

insert (18 or 28), the insert (18 or 28) comprising an 
outer cover (14 or 24) and an inner thermoplastic layer 

(16 or 26), in a female mold shaped in conformity with 
the outer cover (14 or 24) of insert (18 or 28), with the 

outer cover (14 or 24) disposed in conformity with the 
female mold but having at least one exposed edge portion; 

and 
   injection molding a thermoplastic polymer 

composition into a mold including a male mold and the 
female mold containing insert (18 or 28) so that the 

thermoplastic composition contacts thermoplastic layer 
(16 or 26) and interfuses therewith, and surrounds the 

exposed edge portion of insert (18 or 28), forming a 
panel member (15 or 25) having a recess (11 or 12) in 

which such edge portion of insert (18 or 28) is retained, 
wherein insert (18 or 28) covers only a portion of the 

outer surface of panel member (15 or 25) and differs in 
appearance from the outer surface of panel member (15 or 

25). 
The method of claim 1, further 
characterized in that the inner thermoplastic layer (16 

or 26) exhibits shrinkage as a result of injection 
molding of the thermoplastic polymer which is half or 

less of the shrinkage exhibited by the panel member (15 
or 25). 
The method of claim 1, further 
characterized in that outer cover (14 or 24) is made of a 

textile material having a surface texture different from 
the outer surface of panel member (15 or 25), and the 

inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 26) has a thickness and 
composition effective to shield the outer cover (14 or 

24) from damage which would otherwise occur during 
injection molding. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, further 
characterized in that insert (18 or 28) is positioned in 

the female mold with a pair of opposing exposed edge 
portions which become disposed in a pair of spaced 

recesses (11, 12) in panel member (15 or 25) after 
injection molding. 
The method of any of claims 1-3, further 
characterized in that inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 

26) is formed of a material having, at a temperature at 
which the polymer composition of the shaped panel member 

(15 or 25) is fluid, a significantly higher viscosity 
than the polymer composition so as to provide a barrier 

that prevents permeation of the fluid polymer composition 
through the inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 26). 
The method of any of claims 1-3, further 
characterized in that the polymer composition of shaped 

panel member (15 or 25) is based upon an organic 
thermoplastic polymer selected from polyolefins and ABS-type 

copolymers and has a thickness in the range of from 
1 to 10 mm, while inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 26) 

has a thickness in the range of from 0.5 to 3 mm. 
The method of any of claim 6, further 
characterized in that inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 

26) comprises a thermoplastic polymer that is 
substantially compatible with the polymer composition of 

shaped panel member (15 or 25), and a particulate filler 
that remains solid when contacted with the polymer 

composition in fluid state. 
The method of claim 7, further 
characterized in that the thermoplastic polymer 

composition of shaped panel member (15 or 25) comprises 
at least a major portion of polypropylene, and inner 

thermoplastic layer (16 or 26) comprises polypropylene 
and a particulate filler, which consists essentially of 

particulate wood. 
The method of claim 8, further 
characterized in that inner thermoplastic layer (16 or 

26) contains from 20% to 80% of polypropylene and from 
80% to 20% of the filler. 
An interior automotive panel characterized 
in that the panel comprises a stratiform article made by 

the method of any of claims 1 to 3.
