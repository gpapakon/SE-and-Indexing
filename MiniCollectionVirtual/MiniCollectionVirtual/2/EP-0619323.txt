<ABSTRACT>
An anti-allergic agent is disclosed which comprises a human 
monoclonal antibody which binds to an airborne allergen that provokes an 

allergic IgE response, an allergen-binding fragment of such human 
monoclonal antibody or an immune complex of such human monoclonal 

antibody or allergen-binding fragment with said allergen. Pharmaceutical 
compositions and methods employing the anti-allergic agent, cell lines for 

making the human monoclonal antibodies and purified and isolated DNA for 
making the human monoclonal antibodies or allergen-binding fragments 

thereof are also disclosed. 
Also disclosed is a process for making multiple clones from 
an immortalized B-cell population, each of which clones secretes a human 

monoclonal antibody that binds to the desired antigen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anti-allergic agents which 
bind to airborne allergens, which agents are selected from human 
monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) or allergen-binding fragments or immune 
complexes of the human monoclonal antibodies or fragments with said 
allergen. The invention also relates to processes, cells and nucleic acids 
(e.g., cDNA, recombinant vectors, etc.) for making such anti-allergic 
agents. In addition, the invention relates to a process for making a human 
monoclonal antibody to a desired antigen. Many airborne allergens cause degranulation of IgE-sensitized 
basophils/mast cells that results in allergic symptoms (such as 
rhinitis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis and pollen-induced asthma) in 
sensitized individuals. These allergens include tree and grass (e.g., 
ragweed) pollens, house dust mites, cat and dog dander, etc. For example, proteins isolated from aqueous extracts of birch 
pollen are responsible for most of the allergic symptoms occurring the 
middle, eastern and northern Europe, as well as in certain areas of North  
 
America during the early and middle parts of the spring season. Twenty-two 
percent of allergic patients in Central Europe suffer from birch 
pollinosis. Many airborne allergens such as the two major allergens from 
birch pollen have been characterized at the molecular level. For example, 
Bet v is a 17 kD glycoprotein, which has been localized on ultra-thin 
sections of pollen grain in the cytoplasmic matrix (Grote, M., J Histochem 
Cytochem, 39 : 1395-401 (1991). Ninety-seven per cent of patients with 
birch pollen allergy have IgE antibodies that recognize Bet v (Valenta, et 
al., J Allergy Clin Immunol, 88 : 889-94 (1991c). The gene coding for Bet v has been cloned and found to be 
very homologous to the pea disease resistant response gene (Breiteneder, 
et al., Embo J, 8 : 1935-8 (1989). The N-terminus of the protein is not 
subjected to post-translational processing. Bet v, the second major birch allergen, is recognized by the 
IgE antibodies of 9% of patients allergic to birch (Valenta, 1991c, supra). 
Bet v relates to profilin, an ubiquitous component of the cytoskeleton 
which constitutes a family of functional plant pan-allergens, that is present 
in trees, grasses and weeds. Approximately 20% of all patients allergic to 
pollen also respond to the profilins (Valenta, et al., Science, 253 : 557-60 
(1991b). Both recombinant Bet v and Bet v allergens expressed in E. 
coli are recognized by IgE from birch pollen allergic patients
