<ABSTRACT>
A turn table in an optical disk apparatus in 
accordance with the present invention is provided with a 

mount section for use in a mini disk (MD) at the top 
portion thereof and another mount section for use in a 

compact disk (CD) at the base portion thereof. This 
arrangement makes it possible to drive optical disks of 

different types by the use of the same turn table. Below 
the turn table, are installed an optical pickup and a base 

plate that is provided with switches for discriminating 
whether the MD in question is dedicated solely to 

reproduction use or is used for both recording and 
reproduction, and positioning pins for the MD. The 

optical pickup is also allowed to move in the radial 
direction of the disk by support members. The optical 

pickup, the support members and the base plate are 
integrally moved up and down between a station close to 

the MD and a station close to the CD. This arrangement 
eliminates the necessity of an adapter that enables 

optical disks of different types to be appropriately 

placed on the turn table, and makes the optical disk 
apparatus compact by integrating various mechanisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk driving
device which is used in disk apparatuses, such as for
example optical disk players, that optically record and
reproduce information, and which is capable of handling
either a cartridge containing a disk inside the case
thereof or a disk that is not contained in a case.Conventionally, compact disks (hereinafter, referred
to as CDs) and compact disks of SP type (hereinafter,
referred to as 8cm-CDs) are known to the art as optical
disks wherein information can be recorded in digital form.
Recently, mini disks (hereinafter, referred to as MDs) 
have been developed as optical disks where information can
be both recorded and reproduced in digital form.These MDs, which are miniaturized by housing them in
cartridges, are easier to handle as compared with CDs and
8cm-CDs, and are convenient in compiling or other tasks
because they make it possible to perform repeatable
recording.In such an optical disk, information is reproduced
therefrom by scanning the information area by the use of
an optical system, including an optical pickup and other
devices, while driving the disk rotatively in a radial
direction. The optical system is designed to be
compatibly used for CDs, 8cm-CDs and MDs.As to the driving method for the rotation of the
optical disk, after the raised portion of the turn table
is fitted to the center hole of an optical disk, the
optical disk is clamped onto the turn table, and the
optical disk is rotated by rotating the turn table.The inner diameters of the center-holes of CDs and
8cm-CDs are set to the same size, while the inner diameter
of MDs is smaller than that of CDs because of the
compactness of MDs.In order to use both of CDs and MDs compatibly in the
same disk apparatus, it is of course proposed that two
turn tables having different diameters be installed; 
however, this method causes the disk apparatus to become
bulky. (Here, an explanation on 8cm-CDs is omitted because
they are placed on the same turn table as used in CDs).
Accordingly, in order to solve the above problem, the
inventors of the present invention have devised a disk
apparatus which has a driving mechanism that is compatibly
applied to both types of the disks by the use of one turn
table.In this disk apparatus, as shown in Figs. 23 and 24,
a lid 100 is installed so as to rotatively move on a
fulcrum 100a such that the cabinet 126 can be opened and
shut. Opening the lid 100 allows an MD 150 or a CD 160,
which will be described later, to be placed on or removed
from the apparatus.

and an upper face for supporting the pivot arm means so as to
allow the pivot arm means to freely pivot, the first-mode detection

switch and the second-mode detection switch being fixed
to the upper face.
The optical disk apparatus as defined in claim 57, wherein
the pivot arm means is attached to a shaft on the upper face so

as to pivot in the first direction or in the second direction
between the first-mode detection switch and the second-mode detection 

switch, the first-mode detection switch and the second-mode
detection switch being turned on upon contacting the pivot

arm means.
The optical disk apparatus as defined in claim 54, further
comprising:


second detection means (2) for detecting the fact that the
second recording medium is placed on the driving member; and
control means (40) for determining whether or not the
reading means is located at the second-mode station in accordance

with signals from the second detection means and the second-mode
detection means in the case where the second recording

medium is placed on the driving member, and for controlling the
shifting means so that the reading means is moved to the second-mode

station when no detection is obtained as to the fact
that the reading means has been moved to the second-mode station.
