<ABSTRACT>
A reusable endoscopic surgical instrument (10) includes a 
handle assembly (14) attached to a slender shaft assembly. 

The shaft assembly (12) includes inner and outer shafts (18,16), 
with the inner shaft being rotatable by operation of 

the handle assembly to rotate a surgical tool (9) operably 
connected to the distal end of a pushrod (30) disposed 

within the inner shaft. The handle assembly includes a 
first actuating mechanism for actuating the pushrod to 

operate the surgical tool and a second actuating 
mechanism for rotating the inner shaft. The outer 

shaft is axially slidable with respect to the inner 
shaft to cover a flush port system (78) in the handle 

assembly for cleaning and improved sterilizability of 
the instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a medical instrument
for use in endoscopic surgical procedures, and more
particularly to an endoscopic surgical instrument
capable of rotatably manipulating an attached surgical
tool.The burgeoning field of endoscopic surgery utilizes
surgical instruments with slender barrel portions for
entering cannulas placed in small incisions or wounds
in the patient's body. The advantages of Endoscopic
surgery over conventional open procedure surgery are
due in large part to elimination of the need to make
large incisions in the patient, and include reduced
patient trauma, quicker recovery time and a
significantly lower chance of infection.The distal end of the barrel portion of an endoscopic
instrument can be provided with a precision surgical
tool, such as a pair of jaws or a pair of scissors, for
performing various surgical tasks such as gripping
tissue or body organs, cutting ligaments, and the like.
The surgical tool is actuated by a handle assembly 
attached to a proximal end of the barrel portion and
operated by a surgeon/user.With the working length of the endoscopic surgical
instrument, i.e., the portion of the instrument
inserted into the cannula, typically being 30,5 cm (12 inches) or
more, it is desirable to provide the surgeon/user with
means to precisely maneuver the surgical tool at the
distal end after the instrument is inserted into the
patient's body. Moreover, when an endoscopic surgical
instrument is inserted into an insufflated body cavity,
it is desirable to create an airtight seal between the
cannula and the barrel portion. To preserve this seal,
relative movement between the barrel portion and the
cannula should be kept to a minimum.A conventional endoscopic surgical instrument typically
includes a handle assembly and a slender, elongated
barrel portion attached at its proximal end to the
handle portion. A distal end of the barrel portion has
a surgical tool, or attachment, such as a pair of
gripping jaws for gripping tissue or other internal
body parts. The slender barrel portion is inserted
through the cannula in the patient's body and the
handle portion is operated by the surgeon/user to
mechanically operate the surgical tool.Endoscopic surgical instruments have advanced
mechanically to the point where they are capable of
orienting the surgical tool, that is, angularly
rotating the tool about the longitudinal axis of the
surgical instrument, to properly align the surgical
tool while allowing the surgeon/user to operate the
handle assembly in a normal,

<CLAIMS>
An endoscopic surgical instrument,
comprising:


an elongated shaft assembly (12) having an inner shaft (18);
a handle assembly (14) connected to a proximal end of said shaft
assembly (12);
first actuation means for actuating a surgical tool (7) operably
connected to a distal end of said inner shaft (18); and
second actuation means for rotating said inner shaft (18) to orient the
surgical tool (7) with respect to an axial direction of said shaft assembly (12);

characterized in that
said shaft assembly (12) further comprises an outer shaft (16), said inner
shaft (18) being disposed within said outer shaft (16), said second actuation

means being adapted for rotating said inner shaft (18) within said outer shaft
(16), wherein
said second actuation means includes a barrel cam (25) connected to
said inner shaft (18) and having a helical groove (94) and a control mechanism

(74) with a cam driver (96) engaging the helical groove (94), and wherein said
control mechanism (74) is mounted for linear movement with said handle

assembly (14) thereby to convert such linear movement into rotary motion of
said inner shaft (18) by interaction of said helical groove (94) and said cam

driver (96).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said
first actuation means includes a pushrod (30) axially reciprocally disposed

within said inner shaft (18) and operably connected to said handle assembly
(14). 
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 2, further
comprising a linkage assembly connected to a distal end of said inner shaft

(18) and actuated by axial sliding movement of said pushrod (30).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 1, further
comprising means for restraining rotation of said inner shaft when said first

actuation means is fully actuated to operate said surgical tool (7).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said
first actuation means includes a stationary leg (52) and a pivoting leg (56)

operably associated with said handle assembly (14).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 5, further
comprising a locking mechanism mountable with said handle assembly (14) for

locking said pivoting leg (56) in an actuated position relative to said stationary
leg (52).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 5, wherein said
stationary leg (52) and said pivoting leg (56) include limiting means for limiting

movement of said pivoting leg (56) relative to said stationary leg (52).
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said
handle assembly (14) includes a transition ring (95) at its distal end, said

transition ring (95) having means defining a flushing system (78) including at
least one flush port (82,86) in said transition ring (95). 
An endoscopic surgical instrument according to Claim 8, wherein said
outer shaft (16) is axially slidably disposed on said inner shaft (18) an includes

an enlarged back end (22) for concealing said flush port (82,86).
