<ABSTRACT>
A melt process for the synthesis of poly(metal 
aromatic esters) resins is provided. The process 

provides volatile byproducts which can be easily 
separated from the desired poly(metal aromatic ester) 

resin product. The poly(metal aromatic ester) resins 
are particularly useful as polymer additives for the 

purpose of such things as scavenging traces of water, 
activating sulphur accelerator crosslinking systems, 

and producing intumescent and polyester/metal oxide 
formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a melt process for
the synthesis of poly(metal aromatic ester) resin
compositions, and more particularly relates to an
improved process for making poly(metal aromatic
ester) resins wherein the byproducts formed thereby
are volatile.Poly(metal aromatic ester) resins such as
calcium terephthalate polymers, zinc terephthalate
polymers and tin terephthalate polymers are known,
and are in use as additives for thermoplastic
compositions because of properties such as their use
as scavengers for traces of water, their use as
polymeric lubricants, their use as activators for
sulphur accelerator crosslinking systems, and their
use for generating intumescent char in such
compositions. Suitable resins compositions for
incorporating the above additives include
polypropylene compositions, polyester compositions,
and elastomeric compositions such as styrene
butadiene rubber and EPDM.Method for making poly(metal aromatic ester)
resins include such known processes as reaction of an
aqueous solution of metal terephthalate, for example,
sodium terephthalate, with an aqueous stanous halide 
solution, to form poly(stanous terephthalate) and
sodium halide (metal halide salt). The polymer
formed precipitates out of solution and is difficult
to further purify due to its solvent resistance.
Thus metal halide salt trapped in the polymer matrix
cannot be removed thereby posing contamination
problems. The product thus formed has metal halide
salts contaminates in excess of 100 parts per million
by weight.Accordingly, there is a need to provide an
improved method for making poly(metal aromatic ester)
resins which leads only to volatile byproducts being
developed, and being free of non-volatile byproducts
in the poly(metal aromatic ester) resin.The present invention provides an improved
process for making a poly(metal aromatic ester)
resin, and produces only volatile byproducts which
are easily separated from the desired intermediate
products and final products. The process involves
reacting an aromatic monocarboxylic acid with a metal
oxide to yield a metallic aromatic ester and water.
The water can be easily distilled from the metallic
aromatic ester. The metallic aromatic ester can then
be reacted with a dialkyl ester of an aromatic
dicarboxylic acid to yield a metallic-di-(monoalkyl
aromatic carboxylate) which in turn can then be
reacted with metallic aromatic ester to produce the
desired poly(metal aromatic ester) resin.The process for making the poly(metal aromatic
ester) resin involves
