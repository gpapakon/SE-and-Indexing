: e.g. H, alkyl;   n: 0, 1; characterised in that a corresponding alcohol is taken up in water so that a 5 to 50% strength by weight mixture is formed, stoichiometric amounts of a base are added, which is optionally extended over the entire course of the reaction,   a) 0.1 to 20% by weight, relative to the total suspension, of a metallic redox catalyst are added; b) an oxygen-containing gas is passed through this suspension until the desired degree of reaction is achieved;   c) the catalyst is separated off and   d) the compound of the formula (1) is isolated by spray-drying.   The compounds of the formula (1) are obtained cleanly and in good yield.
