<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to elastomers and articles 
reinforced with 0.10 to 25 phr Graphite fibers having 

a diameter of 0.05 to 0.5 microns and length from 1 to 
40 µm. Also provided is an economical method of 

incorporating very fine Graphite fibers into an 
elastomer matrix. In the method Graphite fibers are 

dispersed in an acidic solution and mixed with a 
coagulating liquid (for coagulating latex), and the 

mixture of graphite/coagulating liquid is mixed with a 
latex solution to provide an elastomer/graphite 

composite.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of 
incorporating graphite fiber reinforcement into an 
elastomer and elastomeric articles using Graphite 
fiber reinforcement. The use of macro short fiber (0.05 mm to 10 mm in 
length with an aspect ratio of 50-200) reinforced 
polymers to make V-belts, tires and other composite 
polymer articles is well known in the art. Such prior 
art composites comprise a rubber composition (for 
example styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), polyisoprene, 
polybutadiene, polychloroprene, nitrile butadiene 
rubber (NBR), ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber 
(EPDM), natural rubber and mixtures thereof),which has 
been loaded with chopped or crushed fiber made from, 
for example, spun polyaramide (e.g. Kevlar® fibers, 
available from E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Company, Inc., 
Wilmington, Delaware), spun amide (e.g. spun nylon 6 
(1,6 polycaprolactam available from Allied Chemical, 
Morristown, N.J.)), polybenzimidazole fibers, spun 
polyesters (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 
also available from Allied Chemical). Micro fibers ( 0.1 um to 10 um in length with an 
aspect ratio of 1-5) can be formed in situ or 
dispersed in a polymer matrix. (When incorporated 
into an article of manufacture, the micro fibers may 
be further elongated, the amount of elongation 
depending on the manner in which the rubber composite 
is processed.) Isayev et al, for example, in U.S.  
 
Patent 4,728,698, teach the in-situ formation of 
fibers in a polymer matrix by the addition of a liquid 
crystal polymer to a base polymer followed by mixing 
and extrusion. It has been shown that the orientation of macro 
fibers in a polymer matrix can be controlled by the 
mixing and/or extrusion of a base polymer containing 
such fibers. The orientation of fibers in a polymer 
matrix improves the modulus (stiffness) of the polymer 
in the direction parallel to the direction of 
orientation. The presence of fibers also improves the 
cut resistance properties, load bearing properties, 
and green strength of the polymer. On the other hand, 
composites loaded with macro fibers tend to have a 
relatively higher hysteresis, which might limit the 
efficiency of the composite, especially when used in 
rubber articles that undergo large numbers of flexes 
in use. Micro fiber composites without anisotropy improve 
the stiffness of a rubber compound while contributing 
little to the hysteresis of the compound. Micro fiber 
loaded composites have a lower hysteresis than 
comparable composites loaded with carbon black or 
macro
