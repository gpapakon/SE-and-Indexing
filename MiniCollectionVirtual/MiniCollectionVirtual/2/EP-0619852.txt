<ABSTRACT>
A railway rail fastening clip (1) suitable for holding down a railway rail (2) is formed from a rod of resilient material bent so as to be approximately M-shaped in plan, the clip (1) being such that, when it is bearing on the flange of a rail (2), the longitudinal axis of a part (14) thereof, which interconnects inner legs (13, 15) of the M, lies in a reference plane which is substantially parallel, but not identical, to a plane containing the longitudinal axes of outer legs (11, 17) of the M. Such clips (1) are used with an anchoring device (5), which, as the clip (1) is installed therein, deflects the outer legs (11, 17) downwardly with respect to the inner legs (13, 15), so as to place the clip under stress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a railway 
rail-fastening clip and assembly and methods of employing 
the same. The applicant's previous inventions, rail clips 
commonly referred to respectively as a "P-R" clip 
(disclosed in GB-861,473) and an "e"-clip (disclosed in 
GB-1,510,224), have both been successful for many years, 
providing low-cost rail fastenings that have been widely 
used in many countries around the world. These clips may 
be installed into shoulders alongside the rail either 
manually, using a sledgehammer to drive the clip into the 
shoulder, or automatically by a clip driving machine. 
Whilst automatic clip installation is obviously more 
desirable, being quicker and less labour-intensive, it 
can be a fairly complex process, requiring accurate 
positioning of the clip relative to the shoulder in order 
to achieve an adequate rail fastening. Another previously-proposed rail clip is disclosed 
in DE-U-8804426.2. This rail clip is approximately 
M-shaped in plan, having straight, mutually-parallel, 
outer and inner legs joined together by bent portions. 
When in use all parts of the clip lie in substantially 
the same plane, but otherwise the inner legs are inclined 
downwardly with respect to the outer legs. Such a clip 
is used in an anchoring device having channels running 
perpendicularly to the rail for receiving the outer legs 
of the clip, the opening between the channels receiving 
the interconnected inner legs of the clip. However, the 
assembly of DE-U-8804426.2 does not provide a 
satisfactory rail fastening and has not been widely used. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a railway rail fastening clip suitable 
for holding down a railway rail, which clip is formed 
from a rod of resilient material bent so as to be  
 
approximately M-shaped in plan, the clip having, 
proceeding from one end of the rod to the other, a 
substantially straight first portion, a bent second 
portion, a third portion, a bent fourth portion, a fifth 
portion, a bent sixth portion, and a substantially 
straight seventh portion, the first and seventh portions 
forming respectively the outer legs of the M, the third 
and fifth portions forming respectively the inner legs of 
the M, the second and sixth portions joining the outer 
legs to the inner legs and the fourth portion connecting 
the inner legs together, the clip being such that, when 
in an unstressed configuration, the longitudinal axis of 
the fourth portion lies in a plane which is inclined with 
respect
