<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of
paper converting, more particularly to rewinding a
web of paper into paper "logs" which are preferably
relatively small diameter rolls of paper typically
wound on cardboard tubular cores and suitable for
cutting into short axial segments resulting
ultimately in consumer sized rolls of toilet paper
or kitchen towels or the like.As shown in Figure 1, atypical prior art
surface winding system 2 typically used a single
winding station 4 which transferred a core at the
beginning of building a log during the early stages
of winding through a nip between two rolls into a
position wherein the log is held between three
rolls. In such systems the log was then passed
through a second nip between two of the three rolls
before completing the winding cycle. It has been
found that transferring the log from a two roll to a
three roll contact and then back to two a roll
contact causes discontinuities in the winding
process reflected in deficiencies in product quality
in logs wound by such a process. The US-A-3 869 095 discloses a winder for a web of sheet material which
operates continuously without start-stop winding operations. The winder uses
three revolvably driven drums which drive a pair of spaced parallel core
shafts. A web of sheet material is fed over a portion of the center drum and is
continuously wound alternately upon first one core shaft until a roll is formed
thereon and then the other shaft. The central drum has a plurality of apertures
defined therein at the circumferential side wall portions interior of this drum
being connectable to a vacuum source. The same refers to the core shaft
members which can be connected to a vacuum source.US-A-4 508 279 discloses a twin station rewinder according to the
preamble of claim 1 and a method of rewinding a web into logs having
the method steps a), b) and d) of claim 22. The present invention overcomes
shortcomings of the prior art by having
uninterrupted three roll contact throughout the
winding cycle which has been found to substantially
improve product quality in the log as it is wound
from the core to the finished diameter. Figure 1 is a block diagram of a prior art
surface winding system.Figure 2 is a block diagram of the twin
station rewinder of the present invention.Figure 3 is a simplified side view of the
twin station rewinder embodiment of the present
invention.Figure 4 is an enlarged fragmentary view
