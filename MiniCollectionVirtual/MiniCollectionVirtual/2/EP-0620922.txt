<ABSTRACT>
A local coil assembly includes an RF coil disposed inside a cylindrical form and a pair of z-axis gradient coils wound around the outside of the cylindrical form. First and second pairs of gradient coils are mounted on opposite sides and extend radially outward from the cylindrical form. These pairs of gradient coils produce a gradient field perpendicular to the z-axis with minimal effect on the operation of the RF coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and, in particular, gradient coils for use with MRI
systems.In MRI, a uniform polarizing magnetic field Bo is
applied to an imaged object along the z-axis of a Cartesian
coordinate system, the origin of which is approximately
centered within the imaged object. The effect of the
magnetic field Bo is to align the object's nuclear spins
along the z-axis.In response to a radio frequency (RF) excitation signal
of the proper frequency, oriented within the x-y plane, the
nuclei precess about the z-axis at their Larmor frequencies
according to the following equation:
F=γ Bo
where F is the Larmor frequency, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio
which is constant and a property of the particular nuclei,
and Bo is the polarizing field strength.Water, because of its relative abundance in biological
tissue and the properties of its nuclei, in of principle
concern in such imaging. The value of the gyromagnetic ratio
γ for water is 4.26 kHz/gauss and therefore, in a 1.5 Tesla 
polarizing magnetic field Bo, the resonant or Larmor
frequency is approximately 63.9 MHz.In a typical imaging sequence, the RF excitation signal
is centered at the Larmor frequency F and applied to the
imaged object at the same time as a magnetic field gradient
Gz is applied. The gradient Gz varies the strength of the
magnetic field Bo along the z-axis and, therefore, causes
only the nuclei in a single slice through the object along an
x-y plane to have the resonant frequency F and to be excited
into resonance.After the excitation of the nuclei in this slice,
similar magnetic field gradients are applied along the x and
y axes. The gradient along the x-axis, Gx, causes the nuclei
to precess at different frequencies, depending on their
position along the x-axis, that is, Gx spatially encodes the
precessing nuclei by frequency. The y-axis gradient, Gy, is
incremented through a series of values and encodes y position
into the rate of change of phase of the precessing nuclei as
a function of gradient amplitude, a process typically
referred to as phase encoding.A weak nuclear magnetic resonance signal generated by
the precessing nuclei may be sensed by the RF antenna "coil"
and recorded as an NMR signal. Typically, the NMR signal is
detected along two perpendicular axes to produce a quadrature
signal having a real and an "imaginary" part. From this 
quadrature NMR signal, a slice of image may be derived
according to well-known reconstruction techniques. A basic
overview NMR image reconstruction is
