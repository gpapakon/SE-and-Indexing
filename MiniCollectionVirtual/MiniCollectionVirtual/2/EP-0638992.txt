<ABSTRACT>
A frequency demodulation circuit having an improved 
detection sensitivity is provided by forming an all-pass 

equalizer in a Quadrature-type demodulator capable of 
allowing a band covering at least a carrier frequency 

deviation to pass therethrough. The equalizer comprises a 
band-pass filter for detecting the frequency deviation of an 

inputted FM carrier signal, a gain-doubling amplifier and a 
substractor for performing subtraction between the signal 

inputted to the band-pass filter and the output of the 
amplifier. The operation of the circuit is such that a FM 

carrier signal is supplied to the band-pass filter through a 
phase shifter and to a phase comparator and the output of the 

substractor and the FM carrier signal are compared to each 
other by the phase comparator to thereby obtain a FM 

demodulated signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frequency
demodulation circuit for detecting a modulated signal from a
FM (frequency modulation) carrier signal.Frequency modulation (hereinafter referred to as "FM")
has a higher S/N than an amplitude modulated wave with
respect to external noises and it is a modulation system
commonly used for transmitting information by means of
television voice signals, stereophonic FM broadcasting and
the like.As a FM detector for detecting a modulated signal from
a FM-modulated carrier signal, there is commonly used a ratio
detector, Foster-Seely detector and etc. but with the
development of semiconductor technology, Quadrature
detectors, PLL-type detectors or the like have come to be
incorporated into receivers. US 4,079,330 discloses several
different forms of Quadrature detector.Fig. 6A is a block diagram of a Quadrature detector of
the type mentioned above. In this figure, reference numeral
1 designates a 90 phase-shifting circuit having a FM carrier
signal input therein, reference numeral 2 designates a
band-pass filter (BPF) which has been adjusted to make the FM 
carrier frequency its center frequency and reference numeral
3 designates a multiplier which detects the phase difference
between the above-mentioned FM carrier signal and the output
of BPF 2 to thereby detect a FM signal. Then the detected
signal is output as a voice signal through a low-pass filter
(LPF) 4.Assuming that the angular frequency of the FM carrier
signal is w, the BPF 2 generates a signal of lead phase with
respect to the center frequency f0 (ω0) thereof when the
relationship of ω0 > ω is established while it generates a
signal of lag phase when the relationship of ω0 < ω is
established.Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 6B, when the product of
the signal waveform of a FM carrier signal ω + 90° input to
the BPF 2 and the output waveform ω of the BPF 2 only when it
is positive is detected, the detection output in a period in
which both of the FM carrier signal ω +90° and the output
waveform w are positive is detected. The average voltage of
this output changes around ω = ω0. Accordingly, the
modulation signal component of the FM carrier signal can be
detected by integrating this output with the LPF 4.Fig. 7 is a schematic block diagram of a PLL-type FM
demodulator wherein reference numeral 5 designates a phase
comparator, reference numeral 6 designates a low-pass filter
(LPF) and reference numeral 7 designates a voltage-controlled 
oscillator (VCO) the oscillation frequency of which is
controlled by the
