<ABSTRACT>
A radiation beam (2) is generated by a laser (1). An optical system (3) 
focuses a radiation beam (1) at a recording layer (4) of a type in which an optically 

detectable change is caused to take place if the recording layer is heated to above a 
write temperature. The recording layer (4) is scanned by the radiation beam in that a 

carrier (5), on which the recording layer (4) is realised, is driven by a motor (6). A 
control circuit (8) feeds the laser (1) with electric power which is converted in the laser 

partly into heat and partly into radiation for the radiation beam (2). The control circuit 

(8) can be brought to a read mode in which the power supplied to the laser has a value 
at which the rise of temperature on the recording layer caused by the radiation beam is 

insufficient to cause an optically detectable change to take place. The control circuit 
may furthermore be brought to a write mode in which the laser (1) is intermittently fed 

with power pulses having a strength at which the rise of temperature in the recording 
layer caused by the radiation beam is sufficiently large to cause the optical detectable 

change to take place. The power pulses generated in the write mode have a strength and 
a duration for which the corresponding mean heat dissipation in the laser is substantially 

equal to the mean heat dissipation in the first read mode. 
This achieves that the wavelengths of the generated radiation in the read 
mode and write mode are equal, so that problems with a wavelength dispersion in the 

optical path of the optical system (3) are avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical recording and reading device 
comprising a radiation source for generating a radiation beam having an intensity which 
depends on the power applied to the radiation source, an optical system for focusing the 
radiation beam at a recording layer of a type in which an optically detectable change is 
caused to take place if the recording layer is heated to above a write temperature, 
scanning means for causing the radiation beam to scan the recording layer for the 
purpose of recording and reading, a control circuit for supplying power to the radiation 
source, the control circuit in a first state of operation supplying power to the radiation 
source to a value at which the rise in temperature of the recording layer caused by the 
radiation beam is insufficient to cause the optically detectable change to take place, and 
the control circuit in a second state of operation intermittently supplying the radiation 
source with power pulses which have a strength for which the rise in temperature of the 
recording layer caused by the radiation beam is sufficiently large to cause the optically 
detectable changes to take place. Such a device is known, for example, from EP-A-0.321.027. A problem that occurs in prior-art device is that the wavelength of the 
generated radiation beam is different for different states of operation. This may lead to 
problems with wavelength dispersion in the optical path of the optical system. After all, 
the behaviour of the optical system depends on the wavelength. For example, the 
distance from the focal point to the focal objective depends on the wavelength of the 
radiation. A change from one state of operation to the other thus leads to a shift of the 
focal point. It is an object of the invention to provide a device in which the 
wavelength difference of the radiation is smaller for the various states of operation. According to the invention this object is achieved in that the control 
circuit is arranged for generating in a second state of operation power pulses which 
have a strength and duration for which the corresponding mean heat dissipation in the 
radiation source is substantially equal to the mean heat dissipation in the first state of  
 
operation. The invention is also based on the recognition that the shift of 
wavelengths for the various states of operation is caused by differences in the mean heat 
dissipation in the radiation source, also termed thermal load of the laser in the first and 
second states of operation. The
