<ABSTRACT>
A 5-HT₃ antagonist containing a novel N,N'-disubstituted amide derivative having a potent and selective 5-HT₃ receptor 
antagonism, represented by general formula (I), a hydrate thereof, or an acid addition salt thereof, wherein R₁ represents 

hydrogen or lower alkyl; R₂ and R₃ may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, 
lower alkenyl, aryl-substituted lower alkyl which may be substituted, acyl or lower alkoxycarbonyl; R₄ represents hydrogen, 

lower alkyl or lower alkoxy; A represents CH or N; and n represents 1, 2 or 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel N,N'-disubstituted
amide derivatives. In more detail, it is concerned with novel
N,N'-disubstituted amide derivatives and their pharmaceutically
admissible acid addition salts, which show an antagonisic
action to 5-HT3 receptor and which are useful as antiemetics,
alimentary tract motor function modulators, antimigraine
agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, etc., and preparative
processes therefor.So far, as antagonists to 5-HT3 receptor, those having an
azabicyclo ring moiety described in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication Nos. Sho 58-978, Sho 59-36675, Sho 61-275276, Hei
1-104072 and Hei 1-106882, those having an imidazole ring
moiety described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
Nos. Sho 60-214784, Sho 63-211279, Hei 2-131485 and Hei 3-2180,
and the like are known.In US-A-4959375 indole- and indazole-carbonyl piperidine
derivatives possessing 5-HT3-antagonistic activity are disclosed.As result of our diligent study for purpose of finding
out such compound having potent and selective antagonistic
action to 5-HT3 receptor, the inventors of the present
invention have found N,N'-disubstituted amide derivatives
which satisfy said purpose and have a different chemical
structure from that of known compounds, leading to completion
of the invention. The present invention relates to novel compounds represented
by a general formula [I]

(wherein R1 denotes a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, R2
and R3, which may be identical or different, denote respectively
a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower alkenyl
group, nonsubstituted or substituted aryl-lower alkyl group,
acyl group or lower alkoxycarbonyl group, R4 denotes a
hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower alkoxy group, A
denotes CH or N.The addition salts of the compounds represented by the
general formula [I] are preferable to be physiologically
admissible salts, and, for example, their salts with an
inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. and their salts with an
organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid,
lactic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid,
tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, etc. can be mentioned.The compounds of general formula [I] include stereo-isomers,
optical isomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, the
compounds [I] often exist as their hydrates and solvates, so 
these hydrates and solvates are also included in the compounds
of the present invention.The terms in this specification will be explained
