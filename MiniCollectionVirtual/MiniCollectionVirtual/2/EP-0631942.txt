<ABSTRACT>
A plastics cap (1) comprising a mounting member (3) and a 
lid member (4) as well as a snap hinge (2) comprising a 

single connecting band (5) connected with curved areas on 
the sides (8, 9) of the mounting member and the lid member, 

respectively, via film hinges (10, 11). During an 
opening or closing movement of the cap (1) the lid member 

(4) passes two bistable positions. The connecting band (5) 
is provided with weakenings (20) in areas spaced within 

its longitudinal side edges (12, 13). The connecting band 
hereby has a particularly good flexing action in use, 

while the plastics cap (1) will always operate reliably, 
in particular during cooling to refrigerator temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a plastics cap comprising a 
mounting member and a lid member which are interconnected 
via a snap hinge which extends past their common closing 
plane and comprises a single connecting band connected at 
its opposite ends with curved areas on the sides of the 
mounting member and the lid member, respectively, via film 
hinges, said opposed film hinges, on their extent from the 
center of the connecting band out toward its longitudinal 
side edges, receding from each other with curvatures which 
substantially correspond to the curvatures of said areas 
on the sides of the mounting member and the lid member, 
respectively, seen in cross-section, said lid member passing 
two bistable positions during an opening or closing 
movement of the cap. US patent specification 3 135 456 discloses a cap of the 
type mentioned above, wherein the mounting member and the 
lid member may be made of many different types of materials, 
such as composition paper, plastics, wood, metal, 
which are joined e.g. by glueing with a resilient connecting 
band preferably made of a plastics material, such as 
polyethylene or polypropylene. It is also mentioned in 
said specification that it is contemplated to make the cap 
of plastics in one piece with the snap hinge by injection 
moulding. However, plastics caps with snap hinges of the above-mentioned 
type have not yet been mass-produced by the ever 
increasing package industry in spite of the fact that 
within the last 10-20 years the package market has taken 
an ever increasing amount of plastics caps with snap 
hinges.  Instead, the package industry has exclusively concentrated 
on the manufacture of plastics caps with snap hinges constructed 
in such a manner that the lid member passes just 
one bistable position during an opening or closing movement 
of the cap. In plastics caps with snap hinges of this 
type the mounting member and the lid member are connected 
directly via a main hinge as well as two connecting bands 
or elements of quite negligible extensibility arranged on 
their respective sides of the main hinge. During opening 
and closing of the cap the snap effect is due to the fact 
that other parts than the connecting bands are flexible 
and capable of yielding; in practice the main hinge and/or 
the sides of the mounting member and the lid member with 
which the connecting bands are connected, yield to provide 
the desired snap effect. However, mass-production of plastics caps with snap hinges 
of this last-mentioned type by

<CLAIMS>
A plastics cap (1) comprising a mounting member (3) 
and a lid member (4) which are interconnected via a snap 

hinge (2) which extends past the common closing plane (L) 
of the members (3, 4) and comprises a single connecting 

band (5), which is connected at its opposite ends (6, 7) 
with curved areas on the sides (8, 9) of the mounting 

member and the lid member (3, 4), respectively, via film 
hinges (10, 11), said opposite film hinges (10, 11), on 

their extent from the center of the connecting band (5) 
out toward its longitudinal side edges (12, 13), receding 

from each other with curvatures which substantially correspond 
to the curvatures of said areas of the sides (8, 

9) of the mounting member and the lid member (3, 4), respectively, 
seen in cross-section, said lid member (4) 

passing two bistable positions during an opening or closing 
movement of the cap (1), characterized in 

that the connecting band (5) is provided with weakenings 
(20) in areas spaced within its longitudinal side edges 

(12, 13). 
A plastics cap according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said areas having weakenings extend 

at least near the end (7) of the connecting band (5) which 
is connected with the lid member (4). 
A plastics cap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the weakenings are provided 

as film hinge like reductions in thickness (20) which extend 
between adjoining parts of the connecting band (5) of 

substantially uniform thickness. 
A plastics cap according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the weakenings comprise film hinge 

 
like reductions in thickness (20) which extend longitudinally 

of the connecting band (5). 
A plastics cap according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the weakenings comprise film 

hinge like reductions in thickness (20') which extend 
transversely to the connecting band (5'). 
A plastics cap according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the longitudinal and/or 

transverse film hinge like reductions in thickness (20; 
21') of the weakenings are mutually parallel. 
A plastics cap according to claim 4 and 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the transverse film 

hinge like reductions in thickness (20') of the weakenings 
extend across the longitudinal center of the band (5'') 

and between a pair of longitudinal film hinge like reductions 
in thickness (20) spaced within their respective 

adjoining side edges on the connecting band (5''). 
A plastics cap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the weakenings are provided 

as areas which have lower thicknesses than areas located 
in adjoining longitudinal relationship with the side edges 

(12', 13') of the connecting band (5'''). 
A plastics cap according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the weakened areas of the lowest 

thickness are located at the longitudinal center of the 
band (5''').

extent, has an evenly decreasing thickness in a direction
