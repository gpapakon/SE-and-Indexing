<ABSTRACT>
An electrophoresis analyser with wavelength selective 
detection include a measurement target consisting of a linear 

fluorescence emitting region in which fluorescence emitting 
points for emitting a plurality of rays of light from a plurality 

of samples are arranged on a straight line. A plurality 
of fluorescence images of the measurement target are 

formed on a light detector (4) via an image splitting means 
(1). Filters (2) with different transmission wavelengths are 

provided in the travelling directions of rays of light from 
the plurality of samples. A line sensor (4) in which a plurality 

of photo-pixels are arranged linearly, is used as the 
light detector (4). A plurality of fluorescence images of the 

measurement target are formed on the detection surface of the 
line sensor (4) by shifting them in the arrangement direction 

of the photo-pixels so that the fluorescence images at the 
fluorescence emitting points do not overlap each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophoresis
analyzer with wavelength selective detection and more
particularly to an electrophoresis analyzer with
wavelength selective detection which is suited to an
electrophoresis analysis apparatus for DNA, RNA, or
protein.To analyze DNA, a method for labeling a sample by a
fluorophore and optically detecting and analyzing the
sample which is electrophoretically separated is used.
To compare and analyze various types of samples or
increase the throughput of analysis, it is necessary to
label a plurality of types of samples respectively by
using a plurality of fluorophores with different light
emitting wavelengths as labeling fluorophores and to
separate and analyze a plurality of types of samples at
the same time. In this case, it is necessary to
separate and detect the wavelength of fluorescence from
each fluorophore. However, generally by using a color
filter wheel having a plurality of filters through
which light with a predetermined wavelength can
transmit, the wavelength of fluorescence is separated 
and measured (Nature, 1986, Vol. 321, p. 674).A conventional gel electrophoresis plate is about
20 cm x 40 cm in size and has a linear fluorescence
emitting region perpendicular to the electrophoretic
direction, which is 10 to 15 cm in length. As a method
for efficiently detecting fluorescence from such a
linear fluorescence emitting region, a method for using
a two-dimensional detector and image splitting prism is
proposed (USP No. 5,062,942). This method makes a
plurality of images of the fluorescence emitting region
which are split vertically using a prism or mirror and
focusing lens on the detection surface of the
two-dimensional detector. Each image is devised so as
to be formed on the detection surface after passing
through a filter installed in each optical path and
wavelength-separated fluorescence images can be
detected.A capillary array electrophoresis method has been
proposed recently as an electrophoresis method for
separating and analyzing various types of samples (USP
No. 5,277,780). The method is designed to line up many
capillaries so as to measure samples and is suited to
high-speed and high-throughput measurement. According
to this method, the inner diameter and inner gel are
slightly different in each capillary, so that the 
electrophoretic speed is changed even in the same
sample. Therefore, it is necessary to determine a
molecular weight standard by migrating a marker labeled
with a fluorophore different from the fluorophore which
is
