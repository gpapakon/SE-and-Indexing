<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a recordable optical 
element that includes a dye. The element has a 

substrate and on the surface of the substrate, a dye 
containing recording layer and a light reflecting 

layer. The dye is a leuco dye which upon exposure 
to a thermally-generated acid becomes an absorption 

dye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical 
recording elements, particularly to those that are 
useful as recordable compact discs. There are many types of optical recording 
materials that are known. In many of the materials, 
the mode of operation requires that the unrecorded 
material have a high absorption and that the 
recorded areas, often referred to as pits, have high 
reflection. The high reflection pits are made by 
ablating away the high absorption recording 
material, usually exposing an underlying reflective 
support. One of the currently popular forms of 
optical recordable element is the compact disc or 
CD. Digital information is stored in the form of 
low reflectivity marks or pits on an otherwise 
reflective background, the exact opposite of the 
above described optical recording materials. In 
this format, the optical information is most often 
in the form of read only memory or ROM. Optical 
information is not usually recorded in real time but 
rather is produced by press molding. In a typical 
process, the optical recording substrate is first 
press molded with a master containing the digital 
information to be reproduced. The thus formed 
information is then overcoated with a reflective 
layer and then with an optional protective layer. 
In those areas having the deformations or pits, the 
specular reflectivity is lower than in those areas 
not having the deformations. It is desirable to produce optical 
recording elements which, when recorded in real 
time, produce a record that mimics the conventional  
 
CD on read out. In this manner, information can be 
added to the CD and the CD can be used on a 
conventional CD player. One recently disclosed system of this type 
is the so called "Photo CD". In this system, 
conventional photographic film is first processed in 
a conventional manner. Then, the images from the 
film are digitized and the digital information is 
recorded in a CD readable form on an optical 
recording material. Images can then be played back 
on a conventional CD type player into a conventional 
television. Since a CD has a capacity for a number 
of digitized images that is greater than the typical 
roll of consumer film, it is anticipated that the 
user will want to add images and information to a 
partially recorded CD. Thus there exists the need 
for recordable, CD compatible optical recording 
material. One method for forming a recordable 
element that mimics conventional mold pressed CD 
elements is to provide a transparent heat deformable 
support having
