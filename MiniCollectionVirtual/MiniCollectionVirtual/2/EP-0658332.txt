<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a frame (1, 3) whereto there is secured a support 
(7) which supports an X-ray source (9) at a first end and an X-ray detector (11) with a 

housing (13) at a second end. The X-ray source (9) and the X-ray detector (11) are 
arranged so as to face one another so that a central ray of an X-ray beam emitted by the 

X-ray source is approximately coincident with a connecting line (C) between the X-ray 
source and the X-ray detector. The X-ray detector (11) is movable along the connecting 

line (C) and a shift of the centre of gravity of the X-ray detector occurring during said 
movement is compensated for by a movement of a counterweight (55) which is coupled 

to the movement of the X-ray detector, so that movement of the X-ray detector requires 
only a comparatively small force which is directed parallel to the direction of the 

connecting line. At least a part (73) of the outer surface of the housing (13) of the X-ray 
detector (11) which is situated near the end facing the X-ray source (9) encloses 

such an angle (α) relative to the connecting line (C), that the distance between this part 
and the connecting line increases as the distance from the X-ray source increases. 

Consequently, practically any collision between the X-ray detector (11) and an object to 
be examined produces a force on the X-ray detector which includes a component which 

is directed away from the X-ray source and
 

parallel to the connecting line (C), so that the X-ray detector is moved away from the 
object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an X-ray examination apparatus, comprising a frame
and a support which is connected thereto and which supports at a first end an X-ray source
and at a second end an X-ray detector which is provided with a housing, said X-ray source
and X-ray detector being arranged opposite one another in such a manner that a central ray
of an X-ray beam emitted by the X-ray source is approximately coincident with a connecting
line between the X-ray source and the X-ray detector, the X-ray detector being movable
along the connecting line, and at least a part of the outer surface of the housing of the X-ray
detector which is situated near its end facing the X-ray source, encloses such an angle
relative to the connecting line that the distance between this part and the connecting line
increases as the distance from the X-ray source increases,An example of such an apparatus is known from US patent No. 5,105,455.Generally, known X-ray examination apparatus provide combined rotation of
an X-ray source and an X-ray detector, secured at opposite ends of f.i. a C-shaped support,
about two mutually perpendicular axes. These axes may intersect at a point (the isocentre)
which is situated on the connecting line between the X-ray source and the X-ray detector.
Generally speaking, such support can also be moved in the vertical direction relative to the
frame. Such apparatus is suitable for irradiating an object from different directions, the X-ray
source and the X-ray detector being arranged so as to face one another and the direction
of irradiation being adjustable. In order to prevent detrimental effects of collisions between
the object to be examined (for example, a patient positioned on a patient table) and the X-ray
detector known apparatus may comprise collision protection devices which deactivate the
support drive when the X-ray detector approaches the object to be examined or another
object.The apparatus as described in the said US patent is provided with an X-ray
detector that has a collision protection device consisting of a protection cover at the
periphery, formed of an elastic material such as rubber, and carries a pressure sensitive
detection mechanism containing optical fibers. When the X-ray detector collides with an
object, the elastic cover material deforms and elastically deforms one or more optical fibers, 
thereby disturbing light flowing through the fibers. The disturbance is detected by an optical
sensor which interrupts a driver to stop further movement of the X-ray detector. It

<CLAIMS>
An X-ray examination apparatus, comprising a frame (1, 3) and a support (7)
which is connected thereto and which supports at a first end an X-ray source (9) and at a

second end an X-ray detector (11) which is provided with a housing (13), said X-ray source
and X-ray detector being arranged opposite one another in such a manner that a central ray

of an X-ray beam emitted by the X-ray source is approximately coincident with a connecting
line (C) between the X-ray source and the X-ray detector

and at least a part (73) of the outer surface of the housing (13) of
the X-ray detector (11) which is situated near its end facing the X-ray source (9), encloses

such an angle (α) relative to the connecting line (C) that the distance between this part and
the connecting line increases as the distance from the X-ray source increases,

characterized in that

the X-ray detector is manually movable along the said connecting line (C) and a shift of the
centre of gravity of the X-ray detector occurring during said movement being substantially

compensated for by a movement of a counterweight (55) which is coupled to the movement
of the X-ray detector, so that movement of the X-ray detector requires only a comparatively

small force in a direction parallel to the connecting line,
said part (73) of the outer surface of the housing (13) of the X-ray detector (11) being
sufficiently rigid such that whenever said part (73) collides with an object, a component

of force on the X-ray detector in a direction parallel to the connecting line is sufficient for
deflecting the X-ray detector along the connecting line and away from the object.
An X-ray examination apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that
at its end which faces the X-ray source (9) the housing (13) of the X-ray detector (11) is

shaped approximately as a truncated cone.
An X-ray examination apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, provided with
drive means (17, 21, 27, 29, 33, 35) for moving the support (7) and an object to be

examined relative to one another, characterized in that there is provided a detection element
(75) which, when the X-ray detector (11) is situated at a maximum distance from the X-ray

source (9), is operative to supply a signal which deactivates the drive means (17, 21, 27, 29, 
33, 35) for the period during which a force component which is directed away from the X-ray

source acts on the X-ray detector in the direction of the connecting line (C).
