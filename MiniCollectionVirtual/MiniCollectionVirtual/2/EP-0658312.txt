<ABSTRACT>
Cheese whey permeate is fermented to produce a 
superior food humectant in a process which includes the 

preliminary steps of adding a bacteria nutrient yeast 
extract and diammonium phosphate to maintain the pH at a 

level of about 5.6, and pasteurizing. The material is then 
cooled to fermentation temperature, inoculated with a 

lactic acid producing culture and permitted to ferment to 
less than about 1% lactose. The fermented mixture is 

agitated and an alkali such as caustic soda (NaOH) is added 
to re-adjust the pH to about 5.6, with continued addition 

to a pH of about 5.8. The product is then pasteurized and 
evaporated to a concentration of greater than about 60% 

solids and is ready for packaging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part 
of co-pending application Serial No. 07/864,322, filed 
April 6, 1992. The present invention relates generally to edible 
humectant materials and particularly to those suitable for 
controlling the moisture content of foods, together with 
the process for preparing such materials from cheese whey 
permeate Humectants, because of their strong affinity for 
water, are widely utilized for their ability to stabilize 
the water content of a variety of material. Amounts of 
added humectants desirably keep the host material within a 
certain preferred range of moisture content in 
circumstances wherein the content otherwise tends to vary 
widely due to changes in the relatively humidity of the 
ambient. The producers of dog food and cat food, for 
example, utilize certain Humectants in order to stabilize 
the moisture content of certain of these products over 
extended periods of time, giving them a longer shelf life. Certain salts of lactic acid, most notably alkali 
metal salts, are known as strongly hygroscopic materials 
and many, such as sodium lactate, have been found to be 
edible and compatible with foodstuff. In this regard, it 
is known to prepare food seasonings from the fermentation 
of cheese whey using lactic acid bacteria and blending 
extracted portions of liquid and solid fractions produced 
by centrifuging the fermented solution. The liquid 
fraction of the resulting liquid/solid centrifuged 
fermentation product contains large amounts of lactic acid 
from which salts are readily formed, for example, by alkali 
hydroxide neutralization. Such a process is the subject of 
U.S. Patent 4 699 793 to Eguchi et al. Bailey et al, in 
U.S. Patent 4 771 001, describe a method of producing 
substantially pure lactic acid from carbohydrate-containing 
media (which may be cheese whey permeate) by continuous  
 
fermentation followed by dual-phase solvent extraction. 
The Bailey et al process is directed to the production and 
extraction of lactic acid using a water immiscible tertiary 
amine phase followed by alkali treatment. Neither of these 
references, recognizes the value of such a fermentation 
product as prepared and without separation or extraction of 
various constituents as a moisture control mechanism in 
food. In accordance with the present invention, the 
fermentation of cheese whey permeate has been found to 
produce a particularly desirable humectant material for 
prepared food products. One application is in pet foods, 
i.e., dog and cat

<CLAIMS>
The method of preparing edible lactate-rich 
hygroscopic material comprising the steps of: 


(a) preparing a cheese whey permeate with a 
solids content of between about 4% and 15%; 
(b) adding bacteria nutrient yeast extract in an 
amount of between about 0.2 and 0.3% w/v, 

and diammonium phosphate in an amount of 
between about .15% and .25% w/v to adjust pH 

to about 5.6; 
(c) pasteurize at a temperature and for a period 
of time to sterilize the solution and cool 

to fermenting temperature; 
(d) inoculate with a lactic acid producing 
culture, and permit to ferment to a desired 

lactose composition; 
(e) agitate and add a compatible basic material 
to adjust and maintain pH of the fermenting 

mass to between 5.0 and about 6.2 with 
continued addition of basic material to the 

fermented mass to a pH of about 5.8; 
(f) pasteurize at a temperature and for a period 
of time to resterilize the solution; and 
(g) evaporate to a concentration of about 60% 
solids. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the range of solids 
content of the cheese whey permeate is between about 5% and 

10%.

material in step (e) is selected from the group consisting 

of NaOH, KOH and NHâ‚„OH. 
The method of controlling the moisture content of 
host food products comprising the step of adding to the 

host food product an amount of humectant material 
comprising the product of the fermentation of cheese whey 

permeate using a lactic acid culture. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the humectant 
material is prepared in accordance with the steps of (a) 

through (g) of claim 1. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the host food 
product is a pet food.
