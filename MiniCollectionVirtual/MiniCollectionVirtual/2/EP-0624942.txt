<CLAIMS>
A split heat-shrink sleeve comprising a strip of heat-shrink 
material (1) having two uniting portions (2) 

adjacent to longitudinal edges (3) of the strip, said 
uniting portions (2) extending substantially radially and 

facing each other, and a member for uniting the uniting 
portions, said member comprising first and second bars 

(6) disposed on either side of the uniting portions (2), 
said bars (6) being fastened together by uniting elements 

(10) passing through the uniting portions (2) of the 
strip (1), characterized in that the bars are associated 

with abutment members (12) disposed to ensure that the 
maximum spacing between the bars is less than the 

thickness of the uniting portions after the sleeve has 
shrunk. 
A sleeve according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the uniting elements (10) are of a length that is 

suitable for leaving clearance between the bars (6) and 
the uniting portions (2) of the strip of heat-shrink 

material prior to the sleeve being shrunk. 
A sleeve according to claim 1 or claim 2, 

characterized in that the uniting elements are 
constituted by pegs (10) having one end fixed to the 

first bar (6.1) and an opposite end carrying an abutment 
head (12). 
A sleeve according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the pegs (10) are fixed to the first bar (6.1) co-operate 

with curvilinear notches (13) formed in the second bar 
(6.2). 
A sleeve according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it includes a strip of hot-weld 

material (5) disposed between the uniting portions (2).
