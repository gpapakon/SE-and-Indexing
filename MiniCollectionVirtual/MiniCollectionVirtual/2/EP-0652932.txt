<ABSTRACT>
Storable non-ionic tensides with improved crystallisation resistance are obtained if, to aqueous preparations containing alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides of formula (I): R1O-(G)p in which R1 is a linear alkyl and/or alkenyl radical with 6 to 22 carbon atoms, G is a sucrose radical with 5 or 6 carbon atoms and p represents numbers from 1 to 10, are added crystallisation moderators selected from the group consisting of a) alkyl oligoglycosides based on short-chained primary alcohols, b) alkyl oligoglycosides based on Guerbet alcohols, c) alkyl oligoglycosides based on polyoles, d) short-chained primary alcohols, e) fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, f) polyethylene glycols, g) glucose and h) iron-(III)-ions.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of storable nonionic 
surfactants, in which crystallization moderators are 

added to aqueous formulations containing alkyl and/or 
alkenyl oligoglycosides corresponding to formula (I): 


R
1
O-[G]
p
   
(I)
 
in which R
1
 is a linear alkyl and/or alkenyl radical 
containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms, G is a sugar unit containing 

5 or 6 carbon atoms and p is a number of 1 to 10, 

characterized in that
 the moderators are selected from 
the group consisting of 


(a) alkyl oligoglycosides based on short-chain primary 
alcohols containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
(b) alkyl oligoglycosides based on polyols, 
(c) glucose and 
(d) iron(III) ions. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 butyl glucosides are used as component (a). 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 alkyl oligoglycosides based on polyols 
corresponding to formula (II): 


HO-(CH

O)
n
-[G]
p
   
(II)
 
in which n is a number of 1 to 10 and G and p are as 

defined above,
 
are used as component (b). 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the crystallization moderators are used in 
quantities of 0.01 to 7% by weight, based on the alkyl 

and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides.
