<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode
for a lithium secondary battery excellent in initial
charge/discharge characteristics and cycleability and to
a lithium secondary battery made using the electrode.A lithium secondary battery having, for
example, a battery construction in which an electrode
containing lithiated cobalt dioxide is used as a cathode
and an electrode containing a carbon material is used as
an anode utilizes the electrochemical reversible
reaction in which lithium from the cathode is doped into
the anode through an electrolyte at a charging stage,
and the lithium is undoped from the anode and doped into
the cathode through the electrolyte at a discharging
stage. Characteristics required for the electrodes are
a large doping ability (capacity) and undoping ability
(capacity) and less deterioration in capacity at the
doping and undoping cycle.From these viewpoints, various proposals have
been made for electrodes containing carbon materials
capable recharging of lithium and for batteries using
such electrodes. Specifically, there have been proposed
various batteries made using as the anode a wide variety
of carbon materials including graphite materials or
carbon materials having a random layer structure, such 
as batteries made using a graphite anode containing
rechargeable lithium in the crystal (Japanese Patent
Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No. 57-208079), batteries made
using an anode of a graphitic material comprising
graphitizable spheroidal particles (Japanese Patent
Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No. 4-115457), batteries made
using an anode of carbon material having a pseudo-graphite
structure prepared by carbonizing organic
polymer compounds (Japanese Patent Kokai (Unexamined
Publn.) No. 62-122066), batteries made using an anode of
carbon material having a specific structure (Japanese
Patent Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No. 62-90863), and
batteries made using an anode of carbon material having
a random layer structure (Japanese Patent Kokai
(Unexamined Publn.) No. 2-66856). Furthermore, as for
cathode materials, there have been proposed batteries
made using as a cathode a metallic chalcogen compound or
a carbon material having a specific structure prepared
by carbonizing an organic polymer compound (Japanese
Patent Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No. 62-122066) and
batteries made using as a cathode a composite oxide
comprising an alkali metal and a transition metal and
additionally Al, In or Sn (Japanese Patent Kokai
(Unexamined Publn.) No. 62-90863).As a result of experiments and
