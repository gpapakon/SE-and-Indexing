<ABSTRACT>
An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker to be installed on an 
internal upper edge of a cooking pot preferably made of a plastic material 

and having, on two side portions, a flange to be jointed to fastening 
elements located on the pot, is characterized in that it is constituted 

starting from a rotary knob (1) having perforations (2) on some portions of 
its upper surface, and having a center tubular shaft with a small circular 

projection on its lower end, so allowing it to be fastened to the body (4) 
of the pressure lid, and to be turned at will to calibrate the vapour exit, 

being located on the lid body (14), below which there is placed a vapour 
condenser (9), the lid assembly being by a counterlid (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to an Utility Model, relating 
to an improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker, the purpose 
of which is to be installed on a pot or similar also made, like 
the lid, of a plastic material, within which diverse ingredients 
are placed, in particular rice with its corresponding seasonings, 
after which it is introduced into a microwave oven. This invention applies to the industry devoted to the manufacture 
of household furniture, particularly household equipment and 
kitchen utensils made of a plastic material. As is well known, there are at present a plurality of pots and 
similar used in kitchen for a quick cooking of a series of foodstuffs, 
acting as pressure cookers. Among the different types known up till now, there are the typical 
pressure cookers, which after placing on them a lid, which 
has a rubber joint and a closing and fitting element, act. This 
closing element, by screwing, ties together, in a fixedly manner, 
the lid and the main body of the pot, then receiving a part which 
acts as a valve, this valve turning when the temperature in the 
pot reaches a fixed pressure which, consequently, causes the turning 
of the pressure part and emits a hissing produced by the 
water vapour or air expelled.  
 It is also known, at present, the existence of a series of conventional 
pots or similar which have such dimensions and thickness 
at their bottoms as, by placing on them a practically air-tight 
lid, they can cook foodstuffs without the addition of water. Likewise, it is known the existence, at present, of a series 
of pans or casseroles having lids which are adjusted or joined 
adequately by means of appropiate clasps, and having, on the center 
portion of their surface, an adjustable valve, through which 
and after being positioned, an almost perfect cooking of the products 
contained is obtained; (see e.g. EP-A-0 111 292). Nevertheless, in all cases, when cooking rice, either in a 
pressure cooker, or in a similar pot acting under controlled 
pressure, it has been checked that the emission outside of liquid 
carrying starch in suspension gives rise, on the upper part 
of the pot, exactly on the lid, to a sticky layer according to 
the starch characteristics, and this layer, after drying,leads 
to additional operations for cleaning it. Also, all pots which are known up till now for pressure cooking 
are made of metal materials, so avoiding the same to be introduced 
in a microwave oven to cook a determined foodstuff such 
as the rice. An obvious solution

An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker to be 
installed on an internal upper edge of a cooking pot preferably 

made of a plastic material and having, on two side portions, a 
flange to be joined to fastening elements located on the pot, 

characterized in that it is constituted starting from a rotary 
knob (1) having perforations (2) on some portions of its upper surface, 

and having a center tubular shaft (3) with a small circular projection 
on its lower end, so allowing it to be fastened to the body 

(4) of the pressure lid, and to be turned at will to calibrate 
the vapour exit, being located on the lid body, below which there 

is placed a vapour condenser (9), this assembly being closed by 
a counterlid (12). 
An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker, according 
to claim 1, characterized in that the lid body has a markedly 

domed structure and has a center projection (5) received and supported 
by the knob, presenting holes (6) on some portions of the upper 

circle surface and fitted with a center tubular orifice (7) for housing 
the knob tubular shaft (3), allowing it to turn, so calibrating the 

vapour exit generated in the cooking, and the lid body having a 
recess (8) surrounding the center projection (5). 
An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker, according 
to the preceding claims, characterized in that the vapour 

condenser is shaped as a part insertable, at its upper side (10), 
in the center projection (5) of the lid body (4), and having, on its 

lower side, a tubular body finished off by small castle protuberances 
(11) resting on the counterlid, so forming a plurality of 

crevices (13) for the exit of vapour, and around the tubular body 
at the upper side of the condenser (9), 

there is arranged a plurality of perforations (14) allowing for 
the vapour 

exit when the knob is in an opening position.  
 
An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker, according 
to the preceding claims, characterized in that the counterlid 

is shaped as a disk which is adjustably fitted to the lid body, having 
a center orifice (15), the perimeter of which is surrounded by a 

tubular body, longitudinal flutes (16) on its external portion with 
a diameter and height which are lesser than those of the condenser 

tubular body, among which tubular bodies the vapour passes when rising inside. 
An improved lid for a controlled pressure cooker, according 
to the preceding claims, characterized in that the vapour 

passing inside the bodies acting as expanding and cooling elements, 
impedes the exit of substances outside, which are deposited on the 

counterlid, and leaving free passage to the vapour passing through 
the condenser and knob orifices when the positioning of the latter 

allows for it and depending on whether the knob orifices 
(2) are or are not coincident with 

those (6) of the lid body (4).
