<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises an inner frame (9) to be situated 
on the base section (1) of the tray, having means (12) of 

attachment to the grooves (7) of the base section (1). It 
also comprises an electrical mechanism mounting plate (10) 

having means (15, 27) of attachment to the inner frame (9), 
with means of attachment to boxes (4) containing the electrical 

mechanisms and with retaining means to an outer frame 
(11). The latter is provided with means of attachment to the 

inner frame (9) which it completely covers and also means of 
attachment to the grooves (7) of the base section (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical mechanism support 
device in a tray for electrical ducting, particularly 
in a tray formed by: a U-shaped rectangular base section, 
having a bottom wall and side walls and by a lid section 
having two inwardly directed lips and an inner surface; said 
bottom wall having attachment means for said electrical 
mechanisms and/or boxes containing said electrical mechanisms, 
and each of said side walls being provided with a longitudinal 
groove for one of said inwardly directed lips. An example of a prior art electrical mechanism support 
device can be found, for example, in DE-A-4 110 690. Normally, the said mechanisms are assembled, with or 
without boxes, by means of the pertinent fixing members in 
such a way that the lid of the tray is interrupted over the 
portion where the mechanism is applied, with the result that 
between the latter and the cut ends of the lid there are 
formed respective visible narrow gaps which also show up any 
irregularity due to the pertinent cut. Furthermore, the said 
narrow gaps form a break allowing the undesirable entry of 
dust, moisture and foreign bodies into the mechanisms and/or 
the tray. It is an object of the invention to overcome the aforementioned 
drawbacks. This object is achieved according to the 
invention by a device of the type mentioned at the beginning 
comprising: (a) an inner frame defining a first perimeter and 
a first rectangular center aperture and which is capable of 
covering a portion of said base section and being disposed 
between two lengths of said lid section; having first means 
of attachment to said base section; and being provided with 
two overhanging center end tabs, capable of overlapping below 
portions of said lid section lengths; (b) an outer frame 
defining a second perimeter and a second rectangular center 
aperture; having second means of attachment to said inner 
frame; and which is capable of covering said inner frame and 
said portions of said lid section lengths; and (c) a 
mounting plate defining a third perimeter and having third 
means of attachment to said inner frame and fourth means of 
attachment to said boxes and means retaining it to said outer  
 
frame. The device of the invention allows the boxes and/or the 
mechanisms to be correctly held in place and the areas 
between the mechanisms and the end edges of the cut lid to be 
covered, thereby avoiding the afore-mentioned drawbacks which 
occur in the usual practice. Further advantages and features of the invention will 
be

<CLAIMS>
An electrical mechanism support device in a tray for 
electrical ducting, particularly in a tray formed by: a base 

section (1), having a bottom wall (3) and side walls (8) and 
by a lid section (2) having two inwardly directed lips (6) 

and an inner surface; said bottom wall (3) having attachment 
means (5) for said electrical mechanisms and/or boxes (4) 

containing said electrical mechanisms, and each of said side 
walls (8) being provided with a longitudinal groove (7) for 

one of said inwardly directed lips (6), characterized in that 
it comprises: (a) an inner frame (9) defining a first perimeter 

and a first rectangular center aperture and which is 
capable of covering a portion of said base section (1) and 

being disposed between two lengths of said lid section (2), 
having first means of attachment to said base section (1); 

and being provided with two overhanging center end tabs (14), 
capable of overlapping below portions of said lid section (2) 

lengths; (b) an outer frame (11) defining a second perimeter 
and a second rectangular center aperture; having second means 

of attachment to said inner frame (9); and which is capable 
of covering said inner frame (9) and said portions of said 

lid section (2) lengths; and (c) a mounting plate (10) defining 
a third perimeter and having third means of attachment to 

said inner frame (9) and fourth means of attachment to said 
boxes (4) and means retaining it to said outer frame (11). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that said 
inner frame (9) has: (i) a first peripheral wall (13) extending 

substantially perpendicularly to the inner frame (9) from 
said first perimeter and which comprises first longitudinal 

portions having teeth (12) capable of retentively engaging 
said grooves (7) of said base section (1); (ii) rectangular 

windows (15) located in said perimeter in the inner frame (9) 
itself and in said first peripheral wall (13); and (iii) 

projections (16) extending upwardly from the inner frame (9) 
itself and which are recessed on the side directed towards 

the periphery of said inner frame (9). 
The device of either of claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that said outer frame (11) has: (i) a second peripheral 

wall extending substantially perpendicularly to the  
 

outer frame (11) from said second perimeter and which comprises 
second longitudinal portions (25) and transverse portions 

(26), said second longitudinal portions (25) being 
capable of covering said first longitudinal portions and 

having spaced apart retaining tabs (28) engageable in said 
grooves (7) of said base section (1) and said transverse 

portions having a free edge capable of engagement with said 
lid section (2); (ii) flanges (27) along the edges of said 

second aperture and having teeth capable of engagement in 
said windows (15).
