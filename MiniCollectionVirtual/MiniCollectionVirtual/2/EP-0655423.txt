<ABSTRACT>
In one embodiment, the present method involves reducing turbulence and 
friction during extrusion by moving an extrusion die in a direction opposite 

to that of the extruded fiber and against a stationary preform arrangement 
inside the extrusion chamber. In another embodiment, an AgCl
x
Br
1-x
 (x from 0 
to 1) preform is doped with AgI or with a compound of the formula: -MY, 

wherein M is selected from Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; or MYâ‚‚, wherein M is selected 
from Mg, Ca, Sr, Pb, Ba, Cd or Hg; and wherein Y is selected from Cl, Br, 

or I. The resulting fiber has a more even core/clad interface with a decrease 
in grain size towards the fiber surface and a grain texture elongated along 

the fiber axis. This structure together with strengthening and stabilizing 
dopants, added to the fiber material, gives decreased and stabilized optical 

losses and a higher elasticity of fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
method of making silver halide crystalline
fibers capable of transmitting infrared
light and to the fiber product made by the
process.
Infrared fibers are of technical interest
for the transmission fo low power
radiation signals from the environment,
such as heat radiation to infrared
tectors. They are of further interest in
remote infrared spectroscopy and in the
transmission of laser energy from CO2 and
CO lasers in particular. Silver halide fibers consisting of silver
chloride (AgCl), silver bromide (AgBr), and their
solid solutions (AgClxBr1-x) show promising
properties for the transmission of middle infrared
radiation. The fibers can either be bare core
fibers, with gas functioning as the lower
refractive index, total reflecting medium or
polymer coated fibers or core/clad fibers where
the cladding contains more AgCl for total internal
reflection. These are described in United States
Patent Numbers 4,253,731; 4,381,141; 4,504,298 and
4,552,434 and considerable improvements have been 
reported over time.Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks in
present silver halide crystalline fibers. One
basic disadvantage of both bare core and step-index
core/clad silver halide fibers is their
tendency to deteriorate optically and mechanically
probably due to recrystallization of the grain
structure, phase separation and silver colloids
formation as well as absorption and diffusion of
extrinsic impurities.Transmission and elasticity have been
observed to decrease remarkably when present
state-of-the-art fibers are bent repeatedly. This
is a result of defect formation linked to the
plastic deformation of the granular structure of
the fibers. Present core/clad fibers frequently 
show intermeshing between the core and the clad
material during their extrusion and, as a result,
bad transmission. This defect arises due to
inhomogeneous deformation during the conventional
extrusion process. Further, fibers produced by
alternative manufacturing methods such as multiple
step-deformation by drawing the fiber through a
row of dies as in, for example, United States
Patents 4,381,141; 4,504,298 and 4,552,434, show
defects such as microvoids and microcracks. It is
assumed that these scattering defects result from
the stretching stress applied in these
manufacturing methods. The core/cladding boundary
also shows defects if the process of successive
rolling by grooved rolls is applied as suggested
in some of the above prior art, probably due to 
the non-symmetric deformation mechanism.
