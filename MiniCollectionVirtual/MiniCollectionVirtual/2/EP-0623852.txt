<ABSTRACT>
A resist composition having an excellent heat 
resistance and capable of sufficiently withstanding to 

an alkali bath at pH of not less than 14 and a bath 
temperature of 80Â°C is provided without degrading 

photosensitive properties by using an uncured novolac 
type epoxy resin, a part of epoxy group of which is 

acrylated, as a resin component of a photosensitive 
resin matrix and adding an imidazole curing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printed circuit board
and more particularly to a
circuit board comprising
a cured resist having excellent resistance to alkali and
thermal resistance without degrading photosensitive
properties.Recently, the miniaturization and high-speed
performance of electronic parts and equipments are
proceeding with the advance of electronics industry. For
this end, a printed circuit board as well as a circuit
board mounting LSI are required to have a high
densification and a high reliability through a fine
pattern.Lately, an additive process in which an
adhesive is applied onto a surface of a substrate to
form a resin insulating layer, and the surface of the
resin insulating layer is roughened and then subjected
to an electroless plating to form a conductor is noticed
as the other method of forming the conductor onto the
printed wiring substrate. According to this method, the conductor is
formed by electroless plating after the formation of the
resist, so that it has a merit that a conductor wiring
having high density and pattern accuracy can be produced
with a low cost as compared with an etched foil process
conducting the formation of pattern through etching
(which is called as a subtractive process).In order to produce circuits having a higher
density and a higher pattern precision by such an additive
process at a low cost, it is particularly important to
select a resist. That is, it is necessary to use a
resist composition which can stick to a surface of a
roughened adhesive layer, with a good followability and has a
high resolution and does not leave a residue of a
developer on the considerably roughened surface after
the development and also provides less of an elute component
even after the immersion in a high alkali bath at a high
temperature for a long time.As the resist composition for a circuit board
satisfying these requirements, compositions having a
resolution obtained by combining a binder
polymer having an average molecular weight above about
hundreds of thousands such as PMMA or the like with an
acryl oligomer or acryl monomer having a photosensitive
group are widely used in view of film-forming property,
resistance to plating bath and thermal resistance.However, the resist composition for a circuit 
board composed mainly of the above polymer has drawbacks
that, since the average molecular weight of the polymer
as a main component is hundreds of thousands, the
resulting cured resist has a low crosslinking
density and when it is immersed in a high-temperature
high alkali
