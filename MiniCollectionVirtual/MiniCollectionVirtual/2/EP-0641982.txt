<ABSTRACT>
All of the entering air is compressed to a high pressure and then cooled to an intermediate temperature. At this temperature, some of the air is turbined (at 4) at medium pressure, and the remainder is liquefied. The low-pressure column operates under a pressure of the order of 1.7 to 5 bar absolute, and its residual gas is expanded in a second turbine (9) after having been heated to ambient temperature then superheated (at 7) by heat exchange with compressed air. Application to the production of impure pressurised oxygen and, simultaneously, of at least one liquid product.

Process for producing gaseous oxygen and/or gaseous
nitrogen under pressure, of the type in which:


air is distilled in an installation comprising a main air
compressor (1), a double distillation column (11)

comprising a low pressure column (13) operating under a
pressure described as "low pressure" and a medium pressure

column (12) operating under a pressure described as "medium
pressure", and a heat-exchanging line (6) serving to cool

the treated air;
the whole of the air to be distilled is compressed (at
1, 3) until at least a high air pressure which is

distinctly higher than medium pressure is reached;
the compressed air is cooled to an intermediate
temperature and part of it is relieved of pressure in a

turbine (4) until medium pressure is reached, before
introducing it into the medium pressure column (12);
the air which has not been turbined is liquefied and then
introduced, after the relief of pressure (at 20, 21), into

the double column;
at least one liquid product drawn off from the double
column is brought (at 15) to production pressure, and the

said liquid product is vaporized by exchange of heat with
the air, and
the residuary gas from the head of the low pressure
column is reheated as far as the hot end of the heat-exchanging

line,

characterised in that:

the low pressure column (13) is operated under about 1.7
to 5 bars, and the medium pressure column (11) under a

corresponding pressure of about 6.5 to 16 bars; and
the residuary gas from the head of the low pressure
column is relieved of pressure in a second turbine (9),

after having reheated it as far as the hot end of the heat-exchanging
line (6).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the residuary gas is superheated, before being relieved of

pressure, by exchange of heat (at 7) with air emanating
from an intermediate stage (1A) of the main compressor (1).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the residuary gas which has been relieved of pressure

is used to cool (at 8) the air emanating from the last
stage (1B) of the main compressor (1), before purification

of the said air in water and in carbon dioxide.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the said liquid product is impure

oxygen, and in that purer liquid oxygen, which is sent to a
stockpiling system (16), is additionally produced.
Installation for producing gaseous oxygen and/or
gaseous nitrogen under pressure, of the type comprising a

double distillation column (11) comprising a low pressure
column (13) operating under a pressure described as "low

pressure" and producing, at the head, a residuary gas, and
a medium pressure column (12) operating under a pressure

described as "medium pressure"; compression means (1, 3)
for bringing the whole of the air to be distilled to at

least a high pressure which is distinctly higher than
medium pressure, the said means comprising a main

compressor (1); means (15) for drawing off from the double
column and for pumping at least one liquid product

resulting from distillation; a heat-exchanging line (6)
bringing the air and the said liquid product into heat-exchanging

communication; and a turbine (4) for relieving
the pressure of part of the said air, the inlet of the said

turbine being connected to an intermediate point in the
heat-exchanging line and its exit being connected to the

medium pressure column (12), characterised in that it
comprises a second pressure-relieving turbine (9), the

inlet of which is connected to the outlet of passages for 
reheating the residuary gas from the heat-exchanging line

(6), at the hot end of the latter.
Installation according to claim 5, characterised in that
it comprises a 
heat-exchanger (7) bringing the gas
circulating between the said outlet and the second turbine

(9) and the air emanating from an intermediate stage (1A)
of the main compressor (1) into heat-exchanging

communication.
Installation according to claim 5 or 6, characterised
in that it comprises a second heat-exchanger (8) bringing

the gas emanating from the second turbine (9) and the air
emanating from the last stage (1B) of the main compressor

(1) into heat-exchanging communication.
Installation according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that the low pressure column (13) has a

distillation section between a lower offtake for liquid
oxygen intended to be stockpiled and a liquid oxygen

offtake connected to the intake of the pump (15).
