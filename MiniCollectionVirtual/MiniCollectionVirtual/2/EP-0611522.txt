<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns microbicidal compositions which include an 
isothiazolone and another biocide, and which are intended to provide more effective and 
broader control of micro-organisms in various industrial systems and for household products, 
agricultural products, and biomedical products, etc. In particular, the present invention relates 
to the use of a composition of 2-n-octyl-4,5-dichloro-isothiazolin-3-one, 
hereinafter referred to 
as 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-3-isothiazolone, with tetrachloroisophthalonitrile. The term "microbicidal" (or "antimicrobial" or "biocidal") as used herein is 
intended to encompass, but is not restricted to, all bactericidal, fungicidal and algicidal activity. Isothiazolones are described in U.S.-A-3,761,488; 4,105,431; 4,252,694; 4,265,899 and 
4,279,762, and elsewhere. Their use as microbicides is well known. We have found that compositions formed from 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-3-isothiazolone 
and tetrachloroisophthalonitrile afford unexpectedly good synergistic 
antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms: the disruptive action on the 
organisms by the two compounds together is unexpectedly greater than the sum of both 
compounds taken alone. This synergy does not arise from the expected activity of the 
components nor from the expected improvement in activity. As a result of the synergy, the 
effective dose required can be lowered, which is not only more economical but also increases 
safety margins. The synergistic compositions of the present invention provide more effective 
and broader control of microorganisms in a number of systems. The present invention thus provides a composition having microbicidal activity 
which comprises 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-3-isothiazolone and tetrachloroisophthalonitrile wherein 
the weight ratio of 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-3-isothiazolone to tetrachloroisophthalonitrile is from 
about 150:1 to 1:250. Important applications of the synergistic antimicrobial compositions of the present 
invention include but are not limited to: inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi in 
aqueous paints and coatings, adhesives, sealants, latex emulsions, and joint cements; 
preserving wood; preserving cutting fluids, controlling slime-producing bacteria and fungi in 
pulp and papermills and cooling towers; as a spray or dip treatment for textiles and leather to 
prevent mold growth; protecting paint films, especially exterior paints, from attack by fungi 
which occurs during weathering of the paint film; protecting processing equipment
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

and the second component of which is tetrachloroisophthalonitrile, 

wherein the weight ratio of first component to second component is from 150:1 to 
1:250. 
Composition according to claim 1, wherein the ratio of isothiazolone to 
tetrachloroisophthalonitrile is 16:1 to 1:64, preferably from 8:1 to 1:8. 
A microbicidal product containing from 5 to 30% of a composition according to 
any claim 1 or 2, a solvent and preferably an emulsifier and water. 
A method for inhibiting or preventing the growth of bacteria, fungi, or algae in 
a locus subject or susceptible to contamination which comprises incorporating onto or 

into the locus, in an amount which is effective to adversely affect the growth of said 
bacteria, fungi, or algae, a composition according to any of claims 1 to 3.
