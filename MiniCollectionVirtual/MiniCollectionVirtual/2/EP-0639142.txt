<ABSTRACT>
A paperboard pallet (100) having a trapezoidal profile is disclosed which comprises two outer stringers (102, 102), an additional stringer (104) therebetween, an upper sheet (106), and a lower sheet (108). Each stringer has a trapezoidal profile. The upper sheet (106) is secured adhesively to a broad, upper end of each stringer. The lower sheet (108) has two outer flaps (142, 142), each being folded upwardly and being secured adhesively to an outer wall of a respective one of the outer stringers. The upper sheet (106) may have two outer flaps (140, 140), each being folded downwardly and being secured adhesively to such an outer wall (120). Several alternative arrangements are disclosed, which include one wherein a lower base of a paperboard tray defines the upper sheet, another wherein a lower base of a paperboard carton (306) defines the upper sheet, and others wherein blocks cut from such stringers replace the stringers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a paperboard pallet.As exemplified in Quasnick U.S. Patent No.
4,867,074 and Smith U.S. Patent No. 5,001,991,
paperboard pallets can exhibit substantial resistance
to crushing and substantial beam strength in orthogonal
directions. The pallets exemplified therein have
longitudinal stringers with trapezoidal profiles, which
provide such pallets with substantial resistance to
crushing and with substantial beam strength in a
longitudinal direction. The pallets exemplified
therein have transverse decking members with
trapezoidal profiles, which provide such pallets with
substantial beam strength in a transverse direction.
The Smith Patent noted above discloses that tubular
reinforcing pieces may be advantageously used to
reinforce the stringers of such a pallet.As exemplified in Hermitage U.S. Patent No.
2,728,545, which corresponds to the pre-characterising
part of Claim 1, it is known for a paperboard pallet to
have longitudinal stringers with trapezoidal profiles
and to have flat upper and lower platforms secured to
such stringers by wire bindings or adhesively. Such
upper and lower platforms are disclosed therein as
extending beyond the lateral walls of the outer
stringers. As exemplified in Fallert et al. U.S. Patent
No. 2,446,914, it is known for a paperboard pallet with
a rectangular profile to have longitudinal stringers
with rectangular profiles, upper sheets with end flaps
folded downwardly and secured adhesively thereto, and
lower sheets with end flaps folded upwardly and secured
adhesively thereto. Gifford U.S. Patent No. 3,464,371
discloses paperboard pallets of related interest, also
with rectangular profiles.So-called "nine-block" pallets are known. Such
a pallet comprises nine blocks in a rectangular array,
an upper sheet secured adhesively to an upper end of
each block, and a lower sheet secured adhesively to a
lower end of each block. In one form known heretofore,
each block is made from corrugated paperboard, which is
folded into a rectangular profile, secured adhesively
to retain the rectangular profile, and disposed with
its corrugations extending vertically.This invention provides a paperboard pallet
having the features claimed in Claim 1.Embodiments of the invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.Figures 1, 2 and 3 respectively are perspective
views of three paperboard pallets, not being
embodiments of this invention. Portions are broken
away in Figure 2 to reveal features that would be
otherwise hidden. Figure 4 is a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A paperboard pallet comprising two outer
stringers (602), an upper sheet (606), and a lower

sheet (608), each outer stringer (602) having a
trapezoidal profile defining a broad upper end, a

narrow lower end, and two lateral walls (620, 622)
tapering toward each other from the broad upper and to

the narrow lower end, the outer lateral wall (620) of
each stringer (602) defining an acute angle relative to

the broad upper end, the upper sheet (606) being
secured in surface-to-surface contact to the broad

upper ends of the stringers (602) and the lower sheet
(608) being secured in surface-to-surface contact to

the narrow lower ends of the stringers (602), the upper
and lower sheets (606, 608) having opposite lateral

flaps (640, 642) which extend beyond the outer edges of
the two outer stringers (602), characterised in that

the flaps (640, 642) of the upper and lower sheets
(606, 608) are folded respectively downwardly and

upwardly against and secured to the outer lateral walls
(620) of the two stringers (602) such that the pallet

has a trapezoidal profile, and in that a plurality of
horizontal slots (630) extend transversely through the

stringers (602) and through the folded flaps (642) of

the lower sheet (608) to permit the blades of a
forklift truck to enter the pallet transversely to the

stringers (602) from either of the two opposite sides
of the pallet, the slots (630) extending less than the 

full height of the folded flaps (642) of the lower
sheet (608).
The paperboard pallet of claim 1, further
comprising at least one additional stringer (604)

disposed between the outer stringers (602), the upper
and lower sheets (606, 608) also being secured to such

additional stringer (104).
The paperboard pallet of claim 2, wherein the
additional stringer (604) also has a trapezoidal

profile.
