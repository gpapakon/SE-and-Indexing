A transmission-type gearbox for motor vehicles, 
having a main shaft (2) coaxial with an input shaft (1) 

and a continuous brake (3), the drive shaft (5) of 
which, lying concentric with the brake rotation axis 

(4-4), is linked during operation to the main shaft (2) 
by means of an auxiliary output (6) having a planetary 

gear (7), and in which one central gear-wheel (8) of 
the planetary gear (7) of the auxiliary output (6) is 

connected to the non-rotating housing (9) whilst the 
other central gear-wheel (10) is connected to the drive 

shaft (5) of the continuous brake (3) and the planet 
carrier (11) is connected to the main shaft (2) during 

operation,
characterised in that
 
the brake rotation axis (4-4) is coaxial with the 

rotation axis (4-4) of the main shaft (2) and the 
continuous brake (3), together with the planetary gear 

(7) of the auxiliary output (6), is designed to be 
arranged between a primary gear (13) on the one hand, 

for which the input shaft (1) serves as the gear input 
whilst at least one counter-shaft (12) and the main 

shaft (2) act as the gear output, and an auxiliary gear 

(15) of planetary gear design on the other hand, which 
is positioned sequentially in the power train between 

the main shaft (2) and the output shaft (14) coaxial 
with the latter, a rotating drive link (19) is provided 

between the planet carrier (11) of the planetary gear 
(7) of the auxiliary output (6) and the planet carrier 

(16) of the auxiliary gear (15), and a hollow shaft (5 
or 18) through which the main shaft (2) passes is used 

as a link between a central gear-wheel (8 or 10) of the 
planetary gear (7) of the auxiliary output (6) and the 

continuous brake (3).  
 
A gear box as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the planet carriers (11 and 16) of the secondary output 

(6) and the auxiliary gear (15) have common axle stubs 
(19), on which the respective associated planets (20 

and 21) are arranged adjacent to one another.
