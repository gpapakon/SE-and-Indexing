<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic printer and an electrophotographic 
printing method and, more particularly to an 
electrophotographic printer and an electrophotographic 
printing method, in which wet toner is used and an 
intermediate transfer medium such as an intermediate 
transfer drum is provided. Electrophotographic printers are designed so that 
electrostatic latent images formed on a photosensitive 
drum are developed by means of toner, and the 
resulting toner images are heated under pressure and 
fixed on a recording medium, such as paper, by using a 
heating roll or other transfer means. Some of these electrophotographic printers are 
provided with intermediate transfer means, such as a 
belt or drum, which can transfer the toner images to 
various recording media, including paper, plastic 
films, metal sheets, etc. The conventional 
electrophotographic printers furnished with the 
intermediate transfer means include, for example, an 
apparatus described in Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Publication (KOKAI) No. 50-23234 and an apparatus 
described in Examined Japanese Patent Publication 
(KOKOKU) No. 57-20632. The former is a wet developing  
 
type which uses wet toner, while the latter is a dry 
developing type which uses dry toner. In the latter 
type, moreover, a belt is used as the intermediate 
transfer means. An electrophotographic printer 
described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 
(KOKAI) No. 63-34573 is known as an example of the wet 
developing type which uses a belt as the intermediate 
transfer means. The electrophotographic printer of wet developing 
type using wet toner, which can use fine toner 
particles of submicron order, has an advantage of 
being able to produce sharper images of higher 
resolution over the dry developing type. In making a color print by using such an 
electrophotographic printer, an electrostatic latent 
image corresponding to one color, e.g., magenta, is 
formed on the photosensitive drum, and is developed by 
means of magenta wet toner. Then, the resulting 
magenta toner image is transferred to the intermediate 
transfer means, e.g., an intermediate transfer drum, 
which is pressed against the photosensitive drum. 
Thereafter, cyan and yellow toner images are 
successively transferred in layers to the intermediate 
transfer drum in like manner to form a multicolor 
toner image. Subsequently, a heating roll is pressed 
against the intermediate transfer drum, the multicolor 
toner image on the intermediate transfer drum is
