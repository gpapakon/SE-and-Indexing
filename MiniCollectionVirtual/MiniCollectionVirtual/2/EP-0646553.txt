<ABSTRACT>
A dry gypsum mortar mix, for producing a foamed gypsum building material, consists of (by wt.) 88-96% settable calcium sulphate, 2-9% alkali, 0.5-2% boric acid, 0.5-3% slaked lime or cement and opt. up to 1% air pore-former, fluidiser and/or retarder, the boric acid having a particle size identical to or smaller than that of the calcium sulphate.

<CLAIMS>
A dry gypsum mortar composition for the preparation of a 
foamed gypsum building material, consisting of from 88 to 

96% by weight of setting calcium sulfates, from 2 to 9% by 
weight of an alkali hydrogencarbonate, from 0.5 to 2% by 

weight of boric acid, and from 0.5 to 3% by weight of lime 
hydrate or cement, and optionally further up to 1% by 

weight of air-entraining additives, flow-control agents 
and/or retarding agents. 
The gypsum mortar composition according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said calcium sulfate predominantly 

consists of Î±-hemihydrate. 
The gypsum mortar composition according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said calcium sulfate predominantly 

consists of anhydrite. 
The gypsum mortar composition according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that said alkali hydrogencarbonate 

is potassium hydrogencarbonate. 
The gypsum mortar composition according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the grain size of said boric 

acid is the same or smaller than that of said calcium 
sulfate. 
A process for the preparation of a foamed gypsum building 
material, characterized in that a dry gypsum mortar  

 
composition according to any of claims 1 to 5 is mixed with 

water and then cast or sprayed. 
Use of a dry gypsum mortar composition according to any of 
claims 1 to 5 as a light-weight building material for 

insulation, back-filling and adjusting of unevennesses in 
the floor, wall and ceiling regions.
