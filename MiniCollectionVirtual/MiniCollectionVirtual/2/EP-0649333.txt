<ABSTRACT>
A device for filtering air that is to be breathed through a tracheostoma, to simulate the role of the nose particularly in patients who have received a tracheostomy comprises a filter (20). The filter comprises a pre-filter (21) formed from electrostatically charged fibres, a first layer (22) formed from activated carbon and a second layer (23) a hydrophilic material such as one that is based on regenerated cellulose material. The filter includes a layer of adhesive by which it can be held in place when in use, and a cover layer (24) on its exposed surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter device for filtering air 
that is to be breathed through a tracheostoma, for example in 
patients who have received a tracheostomy, for example as part 
of a laryngectomy. Under such circumstances, the device can be 
fitted over a tracheostoma, body worn, for example directly 
over a tracheostoma, or to a tracheostomy tube, and serves to 
simulate some of the functions of the nose. The device can 
include a valve to assist in diverting the flow of exhaled air, 
for example to permit speech. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is 
formed through the anterior surface of the neck into the 
trachea. The opening is referred to as a tracheostoma. A 
tracheostomy tube can be provided to extend between the 
tracheostoma and the trachea. A laryngectomy is a surgical procedure, used for example to 
treat a carcinoma, which involves removal of the larynx or 
voice box and creation of a tracheostoma. A consequence of the 
procedure is that the trachea is no longer connected to the 
pharynx but is diverted to the tracheostoma. After this 
procedure, normal nasal function is not possible. In a subject whose breathing functions normally, the nose and 
the mucous membrane lining of the nasal cavity perform 
important functions in conditioning inhaled air. The 
convoluted passages and rich blood supply serve to increase 
both the temperature and humidity of the inhaled air to 
minimise the differential in these parameters with those of the 
surface of the lungs. Normally some heat and moisture is also 
captured from exhaled air prior to its release to the 
atmosphere. The mucous lining of the nasal passages also 
serves to remove particulate matter, such as fine dust 
particles, pollutants and micro organisms, from the inhaled  
 
airstream, and the action of cilia transports mucous and any 
particles away from the lungs. The exchange of heat and moisture, and filtration are clearly 
beneficial to the patient and, in their absence, clinical 
consequences such as increased incidence of chest infections, 
elevated levels of secretion production and encrustation are 
observed. The upper airways also provide resistance to air flow which 
promotes good thoracic muscle tone and allows good respiratory 
function to be maintained. US-3920009 discloses a filter device for air to be breathed 
through a tracheostoma, which comprises an outer fibrous filter 
layer and an intermediate zone formed from a hydrophilic 
cellulosic material which provides heat and moisture

<CLAIMS>
A filter device for filtering air that is to be breathed 
through a tracheostoma, which comprises: 


(a) a first zone (8) for filtering matter filtered in 
a normal nasal cavity from air passing through the 

filter, 
(b) a second zone (10) which provides means for 
exchange of heat and moisture with the air, and 
(c) means (16, 18) by which a seal can be formed 
between the device and the stoma substantially 

continuously around the periphery of the device; 
characterised
in
that
 the said first and second zones are such 
that the resistance to air flow through the device is at least 

about 0.2 kPa.s.l
-1

interstices of, a carrier. 
A device as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, in which the 
carbon material is provided as an activated carbon fabric. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, in which the first zone 
(8) of the filter comprises a fabric whose fibres are charged.

0.5 x 10
-6
 m. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, which 
includes a pre-filter having a filter size that is larger than 

that of the first zone (8) of the filter. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, which 
includes at least one cover layer (4). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, which 
includes formations (52) for mounting a tracheostoma valve 

(54). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, which 
includes a housing (76) in which the filter zone (80) of the 

device, intended for filtering matter filtered in a normal 
nasal cavity from air passing through the filter, is received. 
A device as claimed in claim 13, in which the housing 
includes means for receiving a valve. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14, in 
which the resistance to air flow through the device is less 

than about 1.0 kPa.s.l
