<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a connector which can 
positively effect coupling and detaching of a female 

connector, prevent electric shock and short-circuiting, 
and prevent an electric failure arising from contamination 

by extraneous substances. A lid plate 15 is biased by 
a compression coil spring 22 so that the lid plate is 

held by limit projections 26 at a protection position for 
covering male terminals 12 when a female connector is not 

coupled to the connector. Even if the lid plate 15 is 
pushed down by an external force so that the male terminals 

12 are exposed from the lid plate 15, it can return to 
the protection position by itself when the external force 

is released. Since the lid plate 15 is constrained from 
rotating circumferentially at the protection position, the 

male terminal 12 smoothly passes through a terminal-through 
hole 16 in the lid plate 15 when the female connector 40 is 

inserted into a hood 13 and then the male terminals 12 are 

connected to female terminals 43. When the female connector 
40 is extracted from the hood 13, the lid plate 15 is moved 

to the protection position by a bias of the compression coil 
spring 22. The terminal-through holes 16 in the lid plate 

15 are closed by deformable tongue pieces of a dust-proofing 
rubber plate 150 to prevent the entrance of dust, water, or 

the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector in which
electrical safety is enhanced and more particularly to
a connector suitable for charging a storage battery in
an electric automobile.Recently, electric automobiles having a storage
battery or batteries have been attracting attention in view
of protection of the environment and energy conservation and
some of them have been put to practical use. In such an
electric automobile, it is necessary to be able to readily
interconnect the storage battery and a charger since the
storage battery must be charged. Thus, heretofore, a
connector has been generally utilized to interconnect them.
An example of such a connector will be explained below.A car side connector connected to a battery is
secured to a car body while a charger side connector
is connected to an end of a flexible cable drawn out
of a charger. The car side connector has a plurality of
male terminals exposed in its hood while the charger side
connector has a plurality of female terminals disposed
in its housing to receive the male terminals. The charger
side connector is formed into a shape adapted to be received
in the hood of the car side connector. When the charger
side connector is inserted into the hood, the terminals
are electrically coupled with each other.However, since the male terminals are exposed in
the hood, they may be accidentally touched thus causing
electric shock or be contaminated with extraneous substances
resulting in electrical failure.In order to enhance electrical safety, for example,
Japanese Utility Model Public Disclosure No. 4-124774 (1992)
discloses a connector in which a lid is attached through a
hinge to the hood of the connector so that the lid can close
and release an opening in the hood. However, since the lid must be opened by one hand
to expose the male terminals and a female connector then be
inserted into the hood of the connector with another hand,
this construction requires a two-handed two step operation,
and is therefore inefficient.Further, in order to overcome such problems, Japanese
Patent Public Disclosure No. 4-209479 (1992) discloses a
connector wherein an insulation plate is movably mounted
in a hood, the insulation plate is provided with through
holes through which male terminals pass, a female connector
is coupled to a male connector while pushing the insulation
plate, the female connector and the insulation plate are
detached from the male connector with the female connector
accompanying the insulation plate, the female connector is
disengaged from the

<CLAIMS>
A connector (10) comprising:

a connector body (11) having a plurality of male terminals (12)
which are positioned to stand parallel to each other on a circular end face

thereof;
a cylindrical hood (13) surrounding said male terminals (12);
a circular lid plate (15) disposed in the interior of said hood so that
said plate can move in parallel with said male terminals;
means (20) for biasing said lid plate to an open end of said hood;
means (25) for constraining said lid plate from falling off said
hood; and
means (30) for positioning said lid plate at a given position in a
circumferential direction in said hood;

   characterized in that said positioning means (30) include

an elongated stop projection (31) provided on the inner periphery
of said hood, said stop projection extending in parallel to said male

terminals (12), being shifted from limit projections (26) of said
constraining means (25), being disposed at a position lower than said limit

projection in said hood (13), and having a length longer than that of the
male terminal (12);
a recess (32) provided in a peripheral edge of said lid plate (15) to
be adapted to engage with said stop projection (31), said recess (32) being

arranged in said lid plate (15) so that said recess (32) is shifted from said
stop projection (31) when recesses (27) in said lid plate (15) are fitte
d to
said limit projections (26) of said hood; 
an inner side stop projection (33) provided on the peripheral edge
of the rear side of said lid plate and projecting downwardly adjacent to

said recess (32); and
an outer side stop projection (34) provided on the peripheral edge
of the front side of said lid plate, projecting upwardly and being shifted

circumferentially from said projection (33);
whereby when said lid plate (15) is disposed at a protection
position between said limit projections (26) and said stop projection (31)

in a longitudinal direction of said male terminals (12) and said recess (32)
is fitted to said stop projection (31), said inner and outer side stop

projections (33, 34) engage with said stop projection (31) and one of said
limit projections (26), thereby constraining said lid plate (15) from

rotating circumferentially with respect to said hood (13).

A connector according to Claim 2, wherein said flexible member is
a dust-proofing rubber plate (150) having a plurality of tongue

pieces (152) provided at each position confronting said terminal-through
hole (16).
