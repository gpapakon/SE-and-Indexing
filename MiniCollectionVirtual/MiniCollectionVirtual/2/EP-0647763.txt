<ABSTRACT>
An improved ram-type blowout preventer having an improved resilient ram 
packer which includes an upper (36,62,82,92) retainer 

plate and a lower (37,64,88,94) retainer plate which 
each have a front face with a central recess (44,97) 

therein, a back and sides, resilient 
end elements (38,66) bonded between the plates at the 

sides and having facing surfaces 
extending from front to back and a resilient insert (50,78) shaped 

to be positioned 
between said plates and between said end elements with sides mating with the 

shape of the facing surfaces of the end elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved blowout
preventer and particularly to an improved blowout preventer
in which a portion of the packer which is subject to the
most wear may be easily and quickly replaced.Prior to the present invention blowout preventers have
long had rams which carried a packing element on their
front face which is adapted to seal against both the face
of the opposite packer and around a string positioned in
the recesses of the opposed packers.US Patent No. 4,541,639 discloses a ram-type blowout
preventer with a ram front packer which is replaceable. In
one form of this prior patent, the replaceable portion of
the ram front packer extends completely across the front of
the packer and in another form the replacement form of the
packer extends immediately around the pipe engaging recess
of the packer. In both forms the packer and the insert
have interengaging elements which retain the insert in the
front face of the packer. The insert element of both forms
included both upper and lower retaining plates having the
same shape as the insert and bonded thereto so that the
complete assembly could be removed and a new insert
inserted into the main body of the packer.An object of the present invention is to provide an
improved ram-type blowout preventer having a ram front
packer with a readily replaceable insert which is not
bonded to the packer retaining plates.Another object of the present invention is to provide
an improved ram front packer for a ram-type blowout
preventer which is less expensive than the prior devices
and which functions as well or better than such devices.A further object of the present invention is to
provide an improved ram front packer for a ram-type blowout
preventer in which the wear portion of the resilient packer
material may be replaced without having to replace the
retainer plates of the packer. US-A-4398729 discloses a ram-type blowout preventer
comprising a body with a vertical bore therethrough and
opposed guideways extending radially away from the bore, a
ram in each of the guideways, means for moving each of the
rams in the guideways between a position closing the bore
and a position withdrawn into the guideways with the bore
open, each of the rams having a front face recess, a
resilient packer in the front face recess of each of the
rams, the resilient packer having upper and lower retainer
plates having a front face and sides, and means for
securing the resilient packer within the front face of its
ram, and a first aspect of the present invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A ram-type blowout preventer (10) comprising a body
(12) with a vertical bore (14) therethrough and opposed

guideways (16) extending radially away from the bore, a ram
(18) in each of the guideways, means (22) for moving each

of the rams in the guideways between a position closing the
bore and a position withdrawn into the guideways with the

bore open, each of the rams having a front face recess
(28), a resilient packer (26) in the front face recess of

each of the rams, the resilient packer having upper (36)
and lower (37) retainer plates having a front face and

sides, and means (40) for securing the resilient packer
within the front face of its ram, characterised by two

resilient end elements (38) bonded between the plates
(36,37) and having facing side surfaces (48) extending from

the front face of the packer (26) to the rear of the packer
adjacent the ram recess (28) and a resilient insert (50),

which can be withdrawn from and inserted into the packer
from the rear side of the packer, having a shape mating

with the facing sides surfaces of the end elements and
sized to be received between the plates.
A ram-type blowout preventer (10) according to claim
1 wherein the mating side surfaces (48) of the end elements

(38) and the insert (50) are tapered in a direction toward
the sides of the packer (26) in extending from the front of

the packer toward the rear of the packer.
A ram-type blowout preventer (10) according to claim
1 wherein the mating sides surfaces of the end elements

(70,72) and the insert (74,76) are stepped.
An improved ram front packer (26) for use in the front
face (28) of a ram (18) in a ram-type blowout preventer

(10) comprising upper (36) and lower (37) retainer plates,
each having a front face (28) with a central recess, outer 

sides and backs, and means (40) for securing the packer
into its desired position in the front recess in a ram,

characterised by two end elements (38) bonded between the
plates (36,37) at positions between the plates at their

outer sides, the end elements being resilient and having
inner facing surfaces (48), and a resilient insert (50),

which can be withdrawn from and inserted into the packer
from the rear side of the packer, shaped to be positioned

between the plates and between the inner facing surfaces of
the end elements and having side surfaces (54) mating and

engaging with inner facing surfaces of the end elements.
An improved ram front packer (34) according to claim
4 wherein the inner facing surfaces (48) of the end

elements (38) taper outwardly toward the rear of the
packer, and the insert side surfaces (54) having a mating

taper for engagement with the inner facing surfaces of the
end elements.
An improved ram front packer (60) according to claim
4, wherein the inner facing surfaces of the end elements

(70,72) and the mating side surfaces of the insert (74,76)
are stepped.
An improved ram front packer (80) according to claim
4, wherein the plates (92,94) each have an inner tapering

projection (93,95) adjacent the central portion of the
front face central recess (97).
An improved ram front packer (90) according to claim
4 including upper and lower arcuate elements (92,94)

embedded in the resilient insert (98) having tapering
surfaces (97,100) for restricting the front face of the

insert in the central recess (97).
