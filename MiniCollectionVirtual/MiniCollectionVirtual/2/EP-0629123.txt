<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to pressure
measurement systems, and more particularly relates to a method
for non-invasively determining the intra-arterial blood pressure
of a wearer.Systems for measuring the intra-arterial blood
pressure of a patient can be subdivided into two main
groups--those which invade the arterial wall to access blood
pressure and those which use non-invasive techniques.
Traditionally, the most accurate blood pressure measurements
were achievable only by using invasive methods. One common
invasive method involves inserting a fluid filled catheter into
the patient's artery.While invasive methods provide accurate blood
pressure measurements, the associated risk of infection and
potential for complications, in many cases, outweigh the
advantages in using invasive methods. Because of these risks
associated with invasive methods, a non-invasive method, known
as the Korotkoff method is widely used.The Korotkoff method is known as an auscultatory
method because it uses the characteristic sound made as the
blood flows through the artery to mark the points of highest
(systolic) and lowest (diastolic) blood pressure. Although the
Korotkoff method is non-invasive, it only provides a measurement
of the highest pressure point and the lowest pressure point 
along the continuous pressure wave. While systolic and
diastolic pressure are sufficient for accurate diagnosis in many
instances, there are many applications in which it is desirable
to monitor and utilize the entire characteristic curve of the
blood pressure wave. In these applications, the Korotkoff
method is simply incapable of providing ample information. In
addition to this limitation of the Korotkoff method, it
necessitates the temporary occlusion (complete closing) of the
artery in which blood pressure is being monitored. While
arterial occlusion is not prohibitive in many applications,
there are occasions where the patient's blood pressure must be
monitored continuously (such as when undergoing surgery) and
accordingly, the prohibiting of blood flow, even on a temporary
basis, is undesirable.Because of the above-mentioned risks involved with
invasive blood pressure measurement, and the shortcomings of the
Korotkoff method, extensive investigation has been conducted in
the area of continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring
and recording. Some of these non-invasive techniques make use
of tonometric principles which take advantage of the fact that
as blood pressure flows through the arterial vessel, forces are
transmi
