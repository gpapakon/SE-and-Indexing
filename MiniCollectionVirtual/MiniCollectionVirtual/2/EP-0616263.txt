<ABSTRACT>
A developing method of the present invention has the 
steps of forming a uniform layer of a nonmagnetic 

one-component toner on a developer carrying sleeve with a 
developer blade; rotating an electrostatic latent image 

forming member and the developer carrying sleeve; and 
applying the toner on the developer carrying sleeve onto 

an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrostatic 
latent image forming member. The toner used herein is an 

encapsulated toner having a heat-fusible core material and 
a shell formed thereon. By using this development for a 

nonmagnetic one-component toner of the present invention, 
clear images free from background can be stably formed for 

a large number of copying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
development of a nonmagnetic one-component toner and to a
method of forming fixed images using the development which
are applicable to plain paper copying machines, laser
printers, plain paper facsimiles, etc. More particularly,
it relates to a method for an electrostatic image
development and to a method for forming fixed images
suitable for a reprography system utilizing a nonmagnetic
one-component development in the case where an
encapsulated toner whose shell comprises an amorphous
polyester as the main component is used as the toner
therefor.Conventionally, when images are formed with copying
machines, laser beam printers, etc., the Carlson Method
has been generally used (U.S. Patent 2,221,776, 2,297,691
and 2,357,809, "Electrophotography," p22-p41, R.M.
Shaffert, 1965, The Focal Press).In the electrophotographic method, after the
electrostatic latent image formed on a photoconductor by
optical means is developed in a developing process, it is 
transferred to a recording medium such as a recording
paper in a transfer process and then fixed into the final
image generally with large amounts of heat and pressure
using a fixing roller in a fixing process. In the
conventional method for forming fixed images as described
above, however, through the processes from the formation
of the electrostatic latent image up to the fixing thereof
onto the recording medium, the temperature of the heating
element of the fixing device has to remain at a very high
level and further a high pressure is required.On the other hand, since both the photoconductor and
the developer device have to be maintained at around room
temperature, a considerable distance has to be maintained
between the fixing portion and the photoconductor or the
developer device, which necessitates in making the machine
larger. In addition, it is necessary to force the removal
of the generated heat from the system. The noise produced
by the forced radiation device and the heat dissipated
thereby are one of the major factors of environmental
disruption in business offices.Since the fixing process works independently and
fixing is usually carried out with a fixing device at such
a high temperature of around 200°C with a nip pressure of
not less than 2 kg/cm, as mentioned above, expensive
heat-resistant materials such as heat-resistant resins,
heat-resistant rubbers, etc. have to be provided in the
periphery of the fixing device. Since the fixing is 
carried out at a high temperature as described above, such
