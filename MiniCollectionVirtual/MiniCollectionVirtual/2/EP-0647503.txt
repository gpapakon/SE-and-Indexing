<ABSTRACT>
An actuator (10) has a linearly elongate frame (12), side (14a,b), 
end (16,17), and top covers (18) detachably and selectively mounted on 

side surfaces of the frame, a table mechanism (30) displaceable 
in the axial direction of the frame in response to 

energization of an electric motor (20), and a ball screw (24) for 
transmitting drive forces from the electric motor to the 

table mechanism. The operator can select various actuator 
configurations depending on the environment in which the 

actuator is to be installed and the application in which the 
actuator is to be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an actuator for 
displacing a table through operation of a drive source to 
carry out mechanical work such as the conveying of a workpiece, 
and an actuator system which comprises a plurality of 
such actuators. There has heretofore been known an actuator 
having, as a drive source, an electric motor equipped with a 
sensor such as an encoder, a tachometer generator, or the 
like for making it possible to control a rotational speed, a 
drive torque, a stop position, or the like. The rotational 
motion from the electric motor is converted into linear 
motion by a drive force transmission shaft such as a ball 
screw, a trapezoidal screw, or the like, and the linear 
motion is transmitted to a table mechanism, which is 
displaced to convey a workpiece. An electric motor which is incorporated in such an 
actuator is illustrated in longitudinal cross section in 
FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings. As shown in FIG. 1, 
the electric motor, generally denoted at 1, has a coupling 4 
interconnecting an end of a ball screw 2 and an end of a 
motor shaft 3 coaxially with each other. The coupling 4 
serves to absorb a misalignment between the axes of the  
 
motor shaft 3 and the ball screw 2, and prevent vibrations 
which are produced when rotary motion is converted into 
linear motion and also vibrations which are produced due to 
rotary motion containing a flexural component perpendicular 
to the axis as the ball screw 2 becomes longer, from being 
transmitted to the motor shaft 3. One end of the ball screw 2 is rotatably supported 
by a first bearing 5 comprising balls 5a which are obliquely 
interposed between inner and outer races thereof. Since the 
balls 5a bear loads at a certain angle with respect to the 
axis of the ball screw 2 as indicated by the broken lines in 
FIG. 1, the balls 5a are capable of absorbing a load in a 
direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the 
ball screw 2 and also a load in a direction substantially 
parallel to the axis of the ball screw 2. The motor shaft 3 which is housed in a motor housing 
6 has an end rotatably supported by a second bearing 7 
and a spring washer 8, and an opposite end rotatably supported 
by a third bearing 9, which is of a double bearing 
configuration. The first bearing 5 supports the ball screw 2 in 
both axial and radially inward directions. The second bearing 
7 supports the motor shaft 3 in a radially inward direction 
for thereby absorbing vibrations and inertial forces 
that are generated in a radially
