<ABSTRACT>
In a gasification apparatus for the pressure gasification of fine particulate fuels, a gasification reactor, a quench pipe and a convection boiler with a boiler casing are arranged in a pressure vessel. Above the quench pipe, a deflection device for the crude gas leaving the quench pipe is arranged or formed in the boiler casing. In a zone between the gasification reactor and the convection boiler, a crude gas exit device is located. The gasification reactor is mounted on fixed points in the lower part of the pressure vessel. The convection heating surfaces are borne by the quench pipe in the boiler casing. The quench pipe and the boiler casing are placed in their lower region, above the crude gas exit device, on load-relief elements which have crude gas passages and are mounted on fixed points on the pressure vessel. A quenching gas feeding slot separating the quench pipe and the gasification reactor is located between the gasification reactor and the quench pipe around these. The quenching gas feeding slot is additionally sized as a slot for compensating thermal expansion.
