<ABSTRACT>
A feeding composition containing an insulin-secretomotor amino acid and an antioxidant food material as the essential ingredients, 
which is useful in feeding for making up for the loss of stamina after exercise and the fatigue, inhibiting free-radical 

formation due to hyperpnea occurring during exercise, and furnishing vitamins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nutrient
composition, and more particularly to a nutrient composition
useful for feeding in the state of physical exhaustion or
fatigue due to exercise or the like, suppressing formation of
radicals due to promotion of respiration under exercise, and
feeding vitamins.Today, in order to avoid adult diseases, and wishing
healthy life, there are increasing occasions of enjoying
sports such as golf, fitness exercises, athletics, and tennis,
but foods sufficiently considering the health during and after
exercise have been hardly developed yet.That is, hitherto, as the beverages and foods for
nutritional supplement at the time of exercise or fatigue,
drinks for supplementing water, electrolytes and
carbohydrates, and total nutrients or beverages blending all
nutritional elements in good balance have been known and sold
on market, but they do not sufficiently cope with the physical
changes in special state such as physical exhaustion and
fatigue due to exercise, and it has been demanded to develop
alimentary foods capable of bringing about excellent feeding 
effects, sufficiently coping with such physical changes.Man reserves carbohydrates in the liver and muscles as
glycogen, and the reserve amount is required, as heat, about
1000 to 2000 kcal/body, which is not enough for long-term
exercise or exercise in hunger. In such exercise, instead of
carbohydrates, mainly lipid is consumed as energy source, but
at this time when carbohydrates such as glucose are taken, the
lipid metabolism is blocked, and the carbohydrates reserved as
glycogen are consumed, thereby accelerating the drought of
glycogen. When glycogen is used up, exercise cannot be
maintained.On the other hand, in tough energy-consuming sports
such as marathon and boxing, it is required to keep the
stamina for a long term and recover the lowered stamina
quickly, and keeping and recovering of stamina are correlated
with the amount of glycogen reserved in the body [Bergstram,
J. et al. Acta Physiol. Scand., 71, 140 (1967)].In such exercise, it is desired to reserve sufficient
carbohydrates in a form of glycogen as far as possible, but
with the conventional nutrient drinks or foods, no matter how
much is taken, only the reserved glycogen as carbohydrates is
consumed quickly by priority, and enough feeding and stamina
recovery effects are not expected.In addition, as the life becomes affluent, recently,
the people's interest about health is increasing, and the 
concern about obesity is particularly high. To fight
