<ABSTRACT>
The dimming of the light results by respective switching on or off. The dimming parameters, determining the respective dimming operation, are specified, depending on the detected vehicle condition from a sensor gp. (10), e.g. doors open or closed, ignition on or off, ignition key inserted or turned, central locking on or off, and activating the control operation. At least one of the vehicle conditions is established by a chain of several monitored states. The control is only then activated, if all these conditions are fulfilled as stipulated by a program held in a memory to ensure that unwanted illumination does not occur.

System for the control of the interior lighting of a 
vehicle, in which, 


a number of vehicle states relevant to lighting are 
monitored, each such state being established by 

interrogation of at least one condition-requirement and 
such that if the presence of any such vehicle state is 

detected, an associated control process for 
illuminating and/or extinguishing the interior lighting 

is activated, 
characterized in that
the respective illuminating and/or extinguishing 
process takes place by dimmer operation such that the 

dimming parameters determining the dimmer operation in 
each case are preselected in relation to the vehicle 

state whose detection activates the control process. 
System according to Claim 1, further
characterized in that
 
at least one of the vehicle states is established by a 

chain of interrogated condition-requirements and is only 
confirmed when all these condition-requirements are 

satisfied. 
System according to Claims 1 or 2, further
characterized in that
 
as a dimming parameter of the control process for 

extinguishing the interior lighting, the dimmer operation 
time for extinction is preselected in relation to the 

vehicle state. 
System according to any of Claims 1 to 3, further
characterized in that
 
as a dimming parameter of the control process for  

 
extinguishing the interior lighting, a delay time by which 

the beginning of the dimmer operation process is postponed, 
is preselected in relation to the vehicle state. 
System according to any of Claims 1 to 4, further
characterized in that
 
as dimming parameters of the control process for 

illuminating the interior lighting, the dimmer operation 
time for illumination and the final brightness level are 

preselected. 
System according to any of Claims 1 to 5, further
characterized in that
 
the lighting-relevant vehicle states are ordered in a 

sequence of priority relative to the activation of an 
interior lighting control process. 
System according to any of Claims 2 to 6, further
characterized in that
 
a condition-requirement for each of the lighting-relevant 

vehicle states consists in the fact that the measured 
brightness level of the vehicle interior is below a 

preselected threshold value. 
Device to implement the system according to any of Claims 
1 to 7,
characterized in that
 it comprises 

a central lighting control unit (1) with a program 
memory (9) in which the program sequence of the system 

is stored, 
a group of sensors (10) to interrogate for the 
conditions corresponding to the lighting-relevant 

vehicle states, whose output signals are transmitted to 
the lighting control unit, 
a lighting device (4), and 
a switch (6) controlled by the lighting control unit, 
to activate and deactivate the lighting device. 
Device according to Claim 8, further
characterized in that
it comprises a brightness sensor (3) which senses the 
brightness of the vehicle interior and whose output 

signal is transmitted to the lighting control unit (1) 
as information serving to control the switch (6). 
Device according to Claim 9, further
characterized in that
it comprises a bright/dark signal evaluation unit (7) 
to which the signal from the brightness sensor (3) is 

transmitted, which possesses means (13) of preselecting 
a threshold brightness value and from which a digital 

brightness signal is produced and transmitted to the 
lighting control unit (1). 
Device according to Claim 9, further
characterized in that
 
the brightness sensor (3) and the lighting device (4) are 

connected to the lighting control unit (1) by one and the 
same connection lead (5), such that when the controlled 

switch (6) is closed the lighting device is activated, and 
when the controlled switch is open the output signal from 

the brightness sensor is transmitted.
