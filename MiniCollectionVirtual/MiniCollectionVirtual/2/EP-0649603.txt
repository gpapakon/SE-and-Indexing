<ABSTRACT>
An antioxidant food comprising a product of fermentation of a food containing a manganese-containing natural 
material, such as tea leaves, by using a microbe having a catalase activity, such as 
Lactobacillus plantarum.
 It has 
both a superoxide dismutase-like activity and a catalase activity and hence exhibits an antioxidant activity in the body 

of a living organism, including the digestive tract. Therefore it is efficacious in preventing diseases caused by active 
oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antioxidation
food product, an antioxidation preparation and an
antioxidation method, which aim at preventing or improving
diseases caused by active oxygen, by removing superoxide (O2-)
and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).Various studies on lactic acid bacteria or
physiological effects of food products using lactic acid
bacteria have been made since Metschnikoff's longevity theory.As a function of lactic acid bacteria contained in
fermented milk such as yogurt, for example, intestinal
microflora improving effect, intestinal controlling action,
etc. are well known. Recently, it has been reported that
lactic acid bacteria have various functions such as immune
activation action, antimicrobial action, antitumor action and
the like. As described above, since various health effects
are expected for lactic acid bacteria, fermented milk and
lactic acid bacteria beverage using strains such as
Lactobacillusacidophilus, Lactobacilluscasei and genus
Bifidobacterium, which are also detected in the human bowel,
are put on the market. Database WPI, week 7351, Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; AN 73-78473u
discloses a fermented product with improved quality and reduced losses in storage and
fermentation comprising Lactobacillus plantarum and cabbage as manganese
containing natural material.GB-A-1 197 257 discloses a fermented milk product showing a pleasant flavour
comprising lactic acid bacteria and tea.Database WPI, week 9213, Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; AN 92-099832
describes an antioxidant composition comprising a Mn-containing natural material (tea
leaves) and a dried fermented yeast (koji fungi).EP-A-0 207 039 discloses a process for preventing oxidation of food products. The
process comprising adding an enzymatic composition of an oxidase, its substrate,
catalase and superoxide dismutase. By the way, active oxygen is important as a
biological protection factor such as bactericidal action of
leucocyte, but it becomes apparent that the excessive
production of active oxygen in the living body causes various
tissue disorders.As the ordinary factor for generating active oxygen,
there have been known stresses, alcohols, peroxides, drugs,
exercises and the like. It is pointed out that active oxygen
and lipoperoxide generated by these factors are closely
connected with cerebral nerve diseases, circulatory diseases,
cancers, alimentary diseases, hepatic diseases, arterial
sclerosis, renal diseases, diabetes, ageing and the like.The living body retains a series of oxidation
