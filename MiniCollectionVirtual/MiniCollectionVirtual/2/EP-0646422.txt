<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20) and method for cleaning a moving web (10) of 
sheet material. The apparatus includes a Coanda nozzle having an 

elongated, curved foil (22) and a slit (26) for directing gas at a high 
rate of speed along the foil. The gas from the foil impacts a 

layer of air entrained by the web of sheet material (10) flowing in an 
opposed direction. Impact occurs within a gap formed between the 

foil and the web (10) which becomes increasingly restricted in the 
direction of movement of the web. The entrained layer of air is 

caused to reverse direction within the gap and is mixed with the 
gas from the nozzle under turbulent conditions to clean the web 

and remove particulate material such as dust therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for cleaning webs of sheet material.
More particularly, the apparatus and method of the present invention have
application to removing dust and other particulate matter in an entrained
boundary layer carried along by fast moving paper or other webs. Such dust
and other particulate matter is hereafter generally referred to as detritus.Many arrangements exist in the prior art for cleaning moving webs such
as paper webs. Dust and other entrained particles are often carried along by
such webs and can present health and safety problems as well as quality
control problems.US-A-4 887 623 discloses a method and apparatus for removing
particles from a flexible sheet. The sheet is run over a rotating rod, rotating
in a direction opposite to the running direction of the flexible sheet. The lower
side of the rod is immersed in a bath of solvent to which particles of dust
carried along in an air flow associated with the sheet adhere. The dust is
delivered therefrom into a slit in which a negative air pressure exists.US-A-3 956 760 discloses a method and apparatus for removing dust
from the surface of a moving web in which the surface of the web is washed
with a fountain-type washer supplying washing liquid, the liquid on the web
being subsequently removed by a high pressure blower and pump mechanism.It will be appreciated that dust and other particles must be quickly and
positively removed from fast moving webs such as those found in paper
making and paper conversion facilities. The arrangement of the present
invention accomplishes this objection in a highly efficient, relatively low cost
manner. One of the components of the present system is a Coanda nozzle of
specialised construction which is positioned relative to the web in a particular
manner which provides a highly turbulent interface between air flow from the
nozzle and the entrained layer of air moving with and bordered by the moving
web.While it is known generally to deploy one or more Coanda nozzles along
the path of a moving web to treat the web in some manner or direct movement 
of the web, the arrangement of the present invention incorporates structure
and method steps which cooperate in a unique manner to effectively and
positively clean even very fast moving webs.In one aspect the invention provides a method of cleaning the surface
of a longitudinally moving web having an entrained boundary layer comprising
disposing an elongated curved surface adjacent the web transversely of the
movement thereof characterised in

of its curvature, said curved surface (22) defines with said web (10) a gap (30)
converging in the direction of web movement, said apparatus further

comprising: gas supply means for supplying a flow of gas to the curved
surface (22) so that it attaches to the curved surface by means of the Coanda

effect and passes into the gap in the opposite direction to the web movement
