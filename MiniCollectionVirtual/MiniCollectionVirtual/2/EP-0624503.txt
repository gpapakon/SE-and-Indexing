A skirt for opening and closing the bottom of a vehicle body, the 
skirt comprising a flap (1, 2) that can swing about a hinge (4) fixed 

to its bottom edge and that can be held by locking in the closed 
position, which flap comprises: 


first and second leaves (1, 2) provided with second hinge means 
(3) fixed to the bottom edge of the first leaf (1) and to the top 

edge of the second leaf (2), said second leaf being provided with 
first hinge means (4) fixed to the bottom edge of the second leaf and 

for connection to a vehicle body (8), said skirt being characterized 

by: 
first locking means (5a, 5b) fixed to the first leaf only, to 
the second leaf only, or both to the first leaf and to the second 

leaf; 
second locking means (6) fixed to the first and second leaves, 
e.g. to the bottom edge of the first leaf and to the top edge of the 

second leaf, said second locking means serving to enable the first 
leaf to be positioned in a defined position relative to the second 

leaf; and 
third locking means (7) fixed to the second leaf and to the 
first leaf so as to lock the leaves once they have been folded up one 

on the other. 
An opening and closing skirt according to claim 1, in which 
retaining means (9) are fixed via their second end (10) to the second 

leaf (2), and via their first end (11) to the guide means (14) fixed 
to the body (8) of the vehicle, so that the second end (10) of the 

retaining means (9) enables said retaining means to pivot so that the 
first end (11) of the retaining means (9) can slide along guide means 

(14). 
An opening and closing skirt according to claim 2, in which 
sealing gaskets (71) co-operate with the periphery of the access 

opening of the compartment so as to provide sealing between the first 
and second leaves and the periphery of the access opening of the 

compartment. 
An opening and closing skirt according to claim 3, in which 
sealing gaskets (71) disposed on the bottom edge of the first leaf or 

on the top edge of the second leaf co-operate with the top edge of 
the second leaf or with the bottom edge of the first leaf, so as to 

provide sealing between the bottom edge of the first leaf and the top 
edge of the second leaf. 
An opening and closing skirt according to claim 4, in which the 
fender (12) is fixed over the length of the first leaf, grasping 

means (13) being provided through the fender so as to enable the flap 
to be handled, and so as to provide access to the portion (85) of the 

second locking means (6) that is fixed to the first leaf. 
An opening and closing skirt according to any preceding claim, in 
which the flap is removable.
