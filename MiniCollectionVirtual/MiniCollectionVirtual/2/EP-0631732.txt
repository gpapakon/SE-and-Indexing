<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a scalded sausage, in particular small scalded sausages, and a process for its or their production. Sausages and scalded sausages of the most varied compositions are known in the prior art. However, the consumer now perceives the many chemical additives to be disadvantageous. However, the invention provides a remedy by addition of iodised salt and honey, avoiding nitrate curing salt, cuttering salt, emulsifiers, flavour enhancers, stabilisers and antioxidants, as a result of which a scalded sausage or small scalded sausages which are favourable to the consumer and to health are provided.
