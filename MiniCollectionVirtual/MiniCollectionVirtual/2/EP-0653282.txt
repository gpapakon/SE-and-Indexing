<ABSTRACT>
A gas-feeding nozzle for use with a mold 
attached to an injection molding machine and for 

introducing a pressurized gas into a molten resin 
injected in a cavity of the mold to produce an injection 

molded article having a hollow structure, wherein a top 
portion of the gas-feeding nozzle is formed of a gas 

ejection portion whose inner side wall along a flow 
direction of the pressurized gas has at least one 

concavo-convex portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-feeding
nozzle for use in an injection molding machine for the
production of an injection molded article having an
excellent appearance free of sink marks and distortion.
More specifically, it relates to a gas-feeding nozzle
for feeding a pressurized gas into a molten resin
injected into a cavity of a mold attached to an
injection molding machine for producing an injection
molded article having a hollow structure.For example, JP-A-64-14012 (corresponding to
U. S. Patent 4,740,150) discloses an injection molding
machine for producing a molded article having an
excellent appearance. JP-A-64-14012 discloses a method
in which a molten thermoplastic resin is injected into a
cavity of a mold, then a pressurized gas is introduced
into the molten thermoplastic resin in the cavity to
form a hollow structure within the thermoplastic resin.
Finally, the gas within the hollow structure is released
into atmosphere before the mold is opened.When the gas-feeding nozzle disclosed in
JP-A-64-14012 is used, the gas ejection portion forming
a top portion of the gas-feeding nozzle is filled with
part of the molten thermoplastic resin injected into the
cavity before introduction of the pressurized gas into
the molten thermoplastic resin. Then, the pressurized
gas is introduced into the molten thermoplastic resin in
the cavity through a gas ejection outlet at the top end
of the gas ejection portion. In this case, a gas flow
path is formed in and along the central line of the
molten resin filled in the gas ejection portion forming
the top portion of the gas-feeding nozzle as
schematically shown in Fig. 17. During the introduction
of the pressurized gas, the resin which is semi-molten
or undergoing solidification is pressed onto the side
inner wall of the gas ejection portion. As a result, 
the leakage of the pressurized gas through a gap between
the gas ejection outlet and the mold can be prevented, and
the pressurized gas can be reliably and smoothly introduced
into the molten thermoplastic resin in the cavity of the
mold. In Figs. 17 and 18, numeral 100 indicates a
conventional gas-feeding nozzle, numeral 112 indicates a
gas ejection portion, numeral 120 indicates a gas ejection
outlet, numeral 126 is a gas flow passage, numeral 130 is a
non-return valve, numeral 42 indicates a movable mold
member, numeral 44 indicates a gas inlet portion provided
in the movable mold member 42, numeral 48 indicates a
cavity, numeral 60 indicates a molten resin, numeral 62
indicates a hollow portion
