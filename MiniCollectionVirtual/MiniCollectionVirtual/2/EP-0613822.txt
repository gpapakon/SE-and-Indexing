<ABSTRACT>
A stretcher-injector device (16) to be applied to wrapping machines is 
disclosed, which is suitable to be inserted into each of the two 

lateral film 
sleeves resulting from the wrapping at the two opposite sides of the 

package (20) not covered by the film wrapping; it is actuated 
pneumatically 

both to stretch the film in order to assure its airtightness, and to 
carry out 

the atmosphere change inside the package (20), e.g. of food products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a stretcher-injector device to be 
applied to wrapping machines for the airtight sealing of wrapped 
packages, and for the gas exchange in modified atmosphere packages. It is known that in preparing modified atmosphere packages, the so-called 
wrapping is carried out first, i.e. the circumferential wrapping of the 
package resulting in the formation of a film sleeve projecting from each of 
the two opposite package surfaces not wrapped by the film. Said sleeves 
are then subjected to sealing while simultaneously carrying out the gas 
exchange to obtain the modified atmosphere package (see e.g. DE-C-3 116 530). It is also known that, the film used in wrapping being of the non-extensible 
kind, at said sleeves it tends to form folds and/or wrinkles 
which compromise the seal. In fact, for a good outcome of the sealing it is 
important that it is carried out without the presence of folds on the sealing 
line, since these cause such thickness variations on said line that the 
sealing blades can not get into close contact with the film in the lower 
thickness points, thus creating there weakness areas caused by 
insufficient sealing. The object of the present invention is to provide a device capable of 
stretching the film sleeve in each of the two side faces of the package, in 
order to prevent folds and/or wrinkles, so that the sealing blades come in 
contact with the perfectly stretched film, thus achieving a uniform seal 
bead without strength discontinuities. Said device must also be capable of injecting inside the package the 
specific gas for the packaging of items in modified atmosphere. This object is achieved by means of a stretcher-injector device 
having the characteristics specified in claim 1. The stretcher-injector according to the present invention, once it is 
inserted and actuated inside each of the two film sleeves, offers the 
advantage of stretching said film sleeve, which fits tightly the stretcher 
contour, thus allowing a uniform and homogeneous sealing of the film.  
 A further advantage offered by the device according to the present 
invention is that during the step of air aspiration from the package, the film 
airtightly adheres to the periphery of the stretcher-injector thus allowing a 
quick and complete evacuation of the air from inside the package. These and other advantages and characteristics of the stretcher-injector 
according to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled 
in the art from the following detailed description of a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stretcher-injector device for the airtight sealing and gas 
exchange in modified atmosphere packages, wherein it 

consists in a central body (6) enclosing a pair of double-effect linear 
actuators (9) suitable to slide in a proper seat (12) communicating in the 

middle with a first duct (4) for the inflow of compressed air and at the two 
ends with a second duct (5) for the inflow of compressed air, two mobile 

ends (7) fixed onto the stems (8) of said actuators (9) and provided with a 
cover (10) suitable to close the room between the central body (6) and the 

mobile ends (7) but on the device side facing the package, and a lateral 
body (1) integral with the central body (6) and provided with fittings (2, 3) 

for connecting the ducts (4, 5) to a pneumatic plant, and a sleeve (14) for 
connecting the gas exchange plant to a third duct (13) located inside the 

central body (6) and whose apertures (15) come out under the cover (10). 
A device according to claim 1, wherein at least one 
idle roller (11) is mounted on the edge of each end (7). 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the cover 
(10) covers body (6) on all the lateral sides thereof and has passages for 

the gas exchange on the side facing the package. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein body (1) is 
located at mid-length of body (6).
