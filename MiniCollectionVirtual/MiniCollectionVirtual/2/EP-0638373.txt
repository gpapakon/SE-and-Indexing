<ABSTRACT>
Method for the disposal of lamps, which is safe and, as far as possible, emissionless and, respectively, makes available the materials for recycling, in particular of fluorescent lamps, specifically compact fluorescent lamps, as well as mixed-light, mercury-vapour, metal-halide, high-voltage neon, low-voltage neon and sodium-vapour lamps, at least some of the parts forming the lamp being separated, the lamps being inserted into an automatic feeding device and subsequently being transported on by this automatically into at least one subsequent plant section and, in the process, at least one lamp part or material being separated. In the method for the disposal of the glass component of these lamps, in order to have a treatment which is as safe as possible and emissionless, it is advantageous for the glass component of the lamps, in particular the fluorescent tubes or parts thereof, including further components which are still present, to be fed to a breaking device (16) and for the breaking to be carried out under water.
