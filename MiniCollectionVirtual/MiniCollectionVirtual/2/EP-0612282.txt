<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a stable free
aggregate of mineralized wood chips usable in wood concrete
products, and a method of making the same.In wood concrete technology (WCT) fibrous organic
materials such as wood chips (and hereinafter simply referred
to as chips) are used as an aggregate in concrete. This
technology is advantageous for sound and heat insulation since
the wood chips have a low density. However, until recently,
WCT has not been used in the U.S. because most of the
industrial timber is grown in the southern and southeastern
part of the U.S., and is not suitable for WTC. This is due in
part to the fact that such woods, such as Southern Pine,
contain substantial amounts of "cement poisons" which leach
from the organic fibers aggregate into the cement mixture, and
retard the hardening of the cement such that hardening times
are unacceptable.Applicants have previously developed a process known as
K-X treatment for treating organic products WTC. The K-X
treatment process includes forming a free aggregate of chips
of fibrous organic products and encasing the individual chips
with an inorganic mineralising coating to a degree sufficient
to seal in water-soluble organic matter, i.e., the cement
poisons, held in the pores of the chips. This prevents the
leaching of the cement poisons the individual chips when they
are subsequently incorporated into a cement mixture. The
resulting stable free aggregate can be stored without decaying 
and permits a relatively fast hardening time for the concrete
(as little as 10 to 14 hours). The K-X treatment is disclosed
in Applicants' U.S. Patent 5,019,170However, while the K-X treatment represents a substantial
improvement over the conventional WCT, its 10 to 14 hour
hardening time is not entirely satisfactory. It would be
desirable to instead produce an aggregate for WCT which can be
used in concrete products having an even shorter hardening
time.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a process for producing a mineralized free aggregate
usable in wood concrete technology& which can be combined with
cement to produce a wood concrete product which drys or
hardens in a short time.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a process for producing such an aggregate.According to one feature of the invention, the above and
other objects are achieved by a free aggregate usable in
forming wood concrete products and comprising a plurality of
at least partially degassed, individual chips of fibrous
organic material. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A free aggregate usable in forming wood concrete
products, comprising:


a plurality of individual chips of fibrous organic
material, wherein at least a portion of volatile oils in the

pores of the chips have been allowed to evaporate; and
a two layer inorganic mineralizing coating encasing the
individual chips to a degree sufficient to seal in water-soluble

organic matter held in the pores of said chips and
prevent the leaching thereof, while maintaining said

individual chips in a free aggregate form.
The free aggregate of Claim 1 wherein said chips
comprise wood pinchips.
The free aggregate of Claim 2 wherein said coatings
are each a dried layer comprising kaolin.
A process for producing a coated-free aggregate
usable in forming wood concrete products, comprising the steps

of:

forming a free aggregate of chips of fibrous organic
products;
encasing the individual chips with a first inorganic
mineralizing coating to a degree sufficient to seal in water-soluble

organic matter held in pores of said chips, to prevent
the leaching thereof, while maintaining said individual chips

in a free aggregate form;
seasoning the encased chips for a time sufficient for 
volatile oils to escape therefrom; and
encasing the individual chips with a second inorganic
mineralizing coating while maintaining said individual chips

in a free aggregate form.
The process of Claim 4 wherein said chips comprise
wood pinchips.
The process of Claim 4 wherein the mineralizing
coating in said first and second encasing steps is kaolin.
The process of Claim 4 wherein said seasoning step
comprises at least 15 days.
The process of Claim 7 wherein said seasoning step
comprises up to 25 days.
The process of Claim 4 wherein said seasoning step
comprises permitting the chips to cure in piles of no more

than 100 cubic yards, each pile being no more than 2 feet
high.
The process of Claim 9 wherein the piles are turned
over three to four times during the seasoning step.
