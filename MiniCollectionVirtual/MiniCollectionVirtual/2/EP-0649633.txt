<ABSTRACT>
A taper point surgical needle having improved needle 
point strength is disclosed. In one embodiment of the 

needle, a tip portion includes first and second integral 
tapered regions having first and second cross-sectional 

areas respectively which decrease progressively toward the 
tip of the needle in accordance with first and second 

angles of inclination respectively, with the first angle 
being greater than the second angle. In another embodiment 

of the needle of the present invention, the tip portion 
includes a third tapered region integral with the second 

tapered region and having a cross-sectional area which 
decreases progressively toward the needle tip in accordance 

with a third angle of inclination which is smaller than the 
second angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical needles
and, more particularly, to a taper point surgical needle
having improved needle point strength by making the point
from at least two tapered regions having different angles
of inclination.A surgical suture needle of the taper point type
includes a proximal end portion defining a suture-mounting
portion having a hole or channel to which a suture is to be
attached, an intermediate portion defining a main body
portion having a generally uniform cross-sectional area
throughout an entire length thereof, and a distal end
portion defining a tapered portion whose cross-sectional
area decreases progressively toward a pointed distal end of
the suture needle. The tapered portion has no cutting
edges. The surgical needle may have the shape of some part
of a circle which may be from a quarter of a circle to
five-eighths of a circle.In the design of surgical needles it is generally
desirable for needles to exhibit favorable characteristics
in two areas: strength and ease of penetration. It is
desirable for a surgical needle to be strong enough to 
penetrate tissue which is being sutured without bending or
breaking during a surgical procedure. It is also desirable
for the needle to easily penetrate and smoothly pass
through the tissue being sutured. The amount of force
required for needle penetration of tissue includes that
required for the engagement of the tip of the needle and
for the widening of the hole. The suture needle of the
taper point type is caused to pierce the tissue, forcibly
opening the tissue without cutting the tissue. In other
words, after the tip is engaged, a hole is made by pure
blunt dilation with no cutting action whatsoever.
Consequently, the suture needle of this type is used mainly
for suturing blood vessels.In conventional suture needles of the taper point
type, the tapered portion is short, and its length is about
5 to 8 times the diameter of the main body. One of the
reasons for this is that the resistance of the suture
needle to the piercing through the blood vessel of the
living body greatly depends on the degree of sharpness of
the pointed end of the suture needle, and hardly depends on
the amount (hereinafter referred to as "cross-sectional
area increase rate") of increase of the cross-sectional
area of the tapered portion per unit length from the
pointed end toward the main body portion. Therefore, even
if the tapered portion is made short, the piercing
properties of the suture needle are not adversely affected.
