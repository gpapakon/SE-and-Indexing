<ABSTRACT>
Compound threads (1) and the fabrics obtained therefrom 
are very inexpensive, of acceptable quality and preferably 

useable to make recyclable disposable garments. 
Said threads (1) include a thin carrier thread (2) to 

which a web mass (3) coming from the carding of the fiber 
used, is adhered preferably by means of use of a water-soluble 

glue or electrostatic means. 
The compound thread (1) has the possibility of making 
use, upon making the web (3), of the shortest fibrils 

that are usually disposed of. 
One of the fabrics obtained consists of a band or 
strip of web (3) that includes several carrier threads 

(2) placed parallel to each other and that can be cut 
to obtain compound threads (1.) 
Another fabric consists of weft thread and crossed 
warp thread 
of which all or some, depending on the 
different combinations, are compound threads (1.)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to bands and compound threads, 
to fabrics including said threads and to processes to 
obtain said threads and bands. One of the purposes of the invention is to obtain a 
very inexpensive, acceptable quality thread preferably 
for use in disposable fabrics, without eliminating other 
possible uses. Another purpose consists of making use of the cut 
fibers of the carded material from which the threads 
are made, fibers which are disposed of in normal processes 
differing from the invention as no usefulness is found 
for them. Another purpose consists of obtaining a 
band, from whose cutting compound 
threads according to the invention can be obtained. It also has the purpose of providing a disposable 
recyclable fabric whose duration, as well as its applications, 
are similar to those of a conventional textile 
fabric between washing and washing. Another purpose, implicit in the above, is that 
obtainment of the disposable fabric is as inexpensive 
as possible, so that the frequent purchase thereof does 
not imply excess expenses for the user and so that the 
marketing thereof is feasible. The main use of these disposable fabrics is 
in hospitals, barracks, schools and similar places where 
massive use of bed and table linens implies problems and 
excessive cleaning , maintenance, sterilization and repair 
costs; as well as time lost in carrying out such tasks. 
Nonetheless, the disposable fabrics of the invention can 
be useful to any type of establishment or person and for 
other purposes (such as for examples, rags for cleaning  
 
dust cloths, paper pulp, etc.) that are considered convenient. The process to make conventional threads in which one 
starts with the web of the fiber to be used obtained by 
carding, so that initially a carding cord is obtained 
which is the base from which the twisted and stretched 
thread is obtained, is known. The fiber of said cord 
must have long hair so that upon twisting it and stretching 
it, it does not break. This implies the inconveniences 
that all the very short fibers of the material that 
is used are not made use of, and that the thread obtained 
is too expensive, especially if disposable fabrics are 
to be made therefrom. On the other hand, unwoven disposable elements that 
replace traditional textile pieces such as napkins, table 
cloths, paper tissues, etc. are known. Said unwoven elements 
are comprised of an accumulation of layers of cellulose 
with different finenesses with specific properties of 
absorption, resistance and

Process for obtaining a band useful for 
obtaining compound threads, characterized in that the 

process comprises the steps of: 

placing a plurality of carrier threads (2) in 
parallel, such that there is a space between said carrier 

threads (2), said carrier threads being made of first 
fibers; 
applying a web mass (3) of fibers simultaneously to 
said carrier threads (2), said web mass (3) covering said 

carrier threads (2) in a continuous and crossed together 
manner, thereby forming a band (4) wherein said carrier 

threads (2) are adhered. 
Process according to claim 1, wherein said web 
mass is made from second fibers, said second fibers having 

a shorter avarage length than the first fibers. 
A process according to claim 2, wherein the 
second fibers and the first fibers are from the same 

material, the second fibers corresponding to left-over 
fibers produced when treating said material to obtain said 

first fibers. 
A process according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the 
second fibers are fibrils of carded material used to make 

the carrier threads (2). 
A process according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the step of applying the web mass (3) to 

the carrier threads (2) comprises the steps of: 

distributing the web mass (3) on the carrier 
threads; 
subsequently spraying the web mass (3) and carrier 
threads (2) with an adhesive agent, such that the web mass 

(3) and the carrier threads (2) are adhered to constitute 
a bonded band (4). 
A process according to claim 5, wherein the 
adhesive agent is a water-soluble glue.  

 
A process according to claim 6, further comprising 
the step of, after application of the adhesive agent, 

passing the band (4) through rollers. 
A process according to any of claims 1-4, 
wherein the web mass (3) is adhered to the carrier threads 

(2) by electrostatic means. 
A process for obtaining a compound thread, 
characterized in that the process comprises the steps of 


obtaining a band (4) by means of a process according 
to any of claims 1-8; and 
dividing the band (4) in compound threads (1) by 
making longitudinal cuts between every two of the carrier 

threads (2). 
A band (4) made by the process of any of claims 
1-8. 
A compound thread (1) made by the process of 
claim 9. 
A fabric (5) formed by warp threads (6) and 
weft threads (7), the number of crosses of said threads 

(6,7) per surface area being very low with regard to 
conventional values, characterized in that some or all of 

the weft threads (7) and/or some or all of the warp threads 
(6) are compound threads according to claim 11, in such a 

way that there are no spaces or holes (8) between the 
threads (6,7). 
A fabric according to claim 12, wherein the web 
mass is included parallel to the weft threads (7) and 

perpendicular to the warp threads (6).
