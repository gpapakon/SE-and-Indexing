<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for the production of vegetable 
pasta, especially thin-walled vegetable pasta, containing 

high levels of vegetable solids, 
i.e.
, about 4 to about 
15 weight percent vegetable solids. Vegetable pasta can 

be prepared using vegetable solids derived from beet, 
broccoli, carrot, celery, corn, green pepper, spinach, 

tomato, and the like. Such a high level vegetable pasta 
is produced by carefully drying the formed pasta shapes 

under high temperature and low relative humidity 
conditions, whereby a vegetable pasta is obtained with a 

moisture content of about 11 to about 13 weight percent 
and vegetable solids content of about 4 to about 15 

weight percent, wherein the vegetable pasta has, after 
processing and subsequent cooking, good color, texture, 

integrity, and vegetable flavor. The vegetable pasta 
produced by this method also has excellent storage 

stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method 
for the production of vegetable pasta and to the 
vegetable pasta so produced. More specifically, this 
invention provides an improved method for the production 
of vegetable-containing pasta, especially thin-walled 
pasta, which contains high levels of vegetable solids. 
The vegetable pasta of this invention retains good color, 
texture, integrity, and vegetable flavor after cooking. Conventional vegetable pastas, such as spinach- and 
tomato-containing pastas, consist mainly of wheat flour 
with only about 3 to 3.5 weight percent or less vegetable 
solids. Attempts to prepare wheat flour-based vegetable 
pastas with higher vegetable solids levels have generally 
been unsatisfactory. Processes for the commercial manufacture of pasta, 
including vegetable pasta with low levels of vegetable 
solids, are well known. These processes involve mixing 
flour and water and, in the case of vegetable pasta, the 
appropriate vegetable solids, to form a paste. Typically 
the paste is shaped by forcing it through holes in an 
extruder die at high pressure and elevated temperature to 
form extrudates of the desired cross-sectional shape. 
The extrudates may, if desired, be cut to desired 
lengths. The extrudates are usually dried to a moisture 
content of generally less than about 14 weight percent. The drying process in a conventional pasta 
manufacturing process is lengthy. The extrudates as they  
 
leave the extruder generally have a moisture content of 
about 28 weight percent or higher. For shelf-stable 
pasta, the moisture content of the pasta must generally 
be reduced to below about 14 weight percent. To 
accomplish this, conventional long and short pasta goods 
are generally dried to a moisture content of about 10 to 
13 weight percent under normal drying conditions using 
temperature in the range of about 40°C to about 60°C with 
maximum drying times of about 10 hours for short pasta 
goods (i.e., elbow macaroni, elbow spaghetti, shells, 
mafalda, and the like) and about 20 hours for long pasta 
goods (i.e., spaghetti, fettuccine, vermicelli, and the 
like). Under high temperature drying conditions in the 
range of about 60°C to about 80°C, short pasta goods are 
dried for a maximum of about 5 hours and long pasta goods 
are dried for a maximum of about 10 hours. For ultra 
high temperature drying conditions in the range of about 
80°C to about 140°C, short pasta goods are dried for a 
maximum of about 2 hours and long pasta goods are dried 
for a

A method of preparing vegetable pasta containing about 
4 to about 15 weight percent vegetable solids, said method 

comprising 

(1) blending flour, vegetable solids, and water to 
form a homogeneous paste with a water content of about 28 to 

about 33 weight percent, wherein the flour has a minimum 
average protein content between about 12 to about 13.5 

weight percent; 
(2) extruding the homogeneous paste to form 
pasta-shaped extrudates; and 
(3) drying the pasta-shaped extrudates under high 
temperature and low relative humidity conditions, whereby a 

vegetable pasta is obtained with a moisture content of about 
11 to about 13 weight percent and vegetable solids content 

of about 4 to about 15 weight percent, wherein the vegetable 
pasta has, after processing and subsequent cooking, good 

colour, texture, integrity, and vegetable flavor. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the drying step 
comprises 


(a) drying the pasta-shaped extrudates at a 
temperature of about 65 to about 85°C and a relative 

humidity of about 25 to about 60 percent for a time 
sufficient to form a partially-dried vegetable pasta with a 

moisture content of less than about 27 weight percent, and 
(b) drying the partially-dried vegetable pasta at a 
temperature of about 75 to about 115°C and a relative
