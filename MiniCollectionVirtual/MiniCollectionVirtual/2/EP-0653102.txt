<ABSTRACT>
A display device comprising electron-transport ducts having entrance apertures for electrons and means for generating electrons and injecting electrons into the transport ducts via said entrance apertures. Measures have been taken to improve the picture quality. For example, the location of the entrance aperture is not the same for each transport duct, but instead shows a variation. This enables an improved control of the electron flow in the transport ducts to be achieved; in particular crosstalk between the transport ducts can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
Display device of the flat-panel type comprising an electron transport duct and a segmented filament.The invention relates to a display device having a vacuum envelope, said display device comprising an electroluminescent screen and a row of transport ducts for transporting electrons, means for generating electrons and injecting electrons into the transport ducts, means for applying potential differences across the transport ducts to transport electrons through said transport ducts by means of secondary emission, means for extracting electrons from the transport ducts and means for directing electrons towards the electroluminescent screen.A display device of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is described in EP-A 0 436 997. In EP-A 0 436 997 a description is given of a display device in which the means for generating and injecting electrons comprise a line cathode which generates electrons which are injected into the transport ducts by means of electrodes. In general, the aim is to obtain display devices which are constructed so that, in operation, the electron flows in the transport ducts do not deviate from a desired value or deviate so little that it is not disturbing or only to a very small degree. Variations in electron flows, both in one transport duct and between transport ducts, cause a deterioration of the picture quality. It is an object of the invention to provide a display device of the type described in the opening paragraph, in which variations in the electron flows are precluded or reduced. Within the scope of the invention, it has been recognized that the cooperation between and mutual influencing of the means for generating electrons and injecting electrons into the transport ducts are of essential importance in this respect. This recognition is elaborated in various aspects of the invention.According to a first aspect of the invention, the display device is characterized in that the means for generating electrons comprise juxtaposed line cathodes.If one line cathode is used as the source for all transport ducts in the display device, problems with the homogeneity of the image displayed are, for example, caused by a relatively great voltage drop across the line cathode (of the order of magnitude of, for example 100 volts). As a result thereof, the effectiveness with which electrons are generated 

by the line cathode and injected into the transport ducts varies along the line cathode. Due to this, differences between electron flows in different transport ducts occur. The
