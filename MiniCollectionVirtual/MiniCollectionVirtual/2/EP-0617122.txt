<ABSTRACT>
A DNA fragment having the base sequence represented by formula (1) and coding for a tumor cell proliferation inhibiting 
factor can be obtained by preparing a cDNA library from the mRNA of an established cell line derived from 3T3 cells, amplifying 

various DNA fragments which supposedly code for a tumor cell proliferation inhibiting factor by the PCR technique, and analyzing 

the base sequences of the amplified DNA fragments to determine the base sequence of the DNA which codes for the inhibiting 
factor. In said formula (1) X represents TTC TTT CTA or TTC.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA fragments
encoding novel tumor cell growth inhibitors. More
particularly, the present invention relates to DNA
fragments encoding novel tumor cell growth factors which
can be obtained from the culture supernatant of 3T3 cell-derived
cell line and exhibit an activity of inhibiting
the growth of tumor cells.Synthetic drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents
or immunotherapeutic agents have been heretofore widely
used as anti-tumor agents. However, these drugs generally
encounter problems that their specificity is low and side-effects
are serious. On the other hand, many tumor cell
growth inhibitors have been found in tissue culture cells.
These inhibitors could be such anti-tumor agents that
would be highly specific and would have minimized side-effects.
Representative examples of such inhibitors are
interferon, lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
Recently, a tumor cell cytotoxic factor obtained from
human fibroblast and a tumor cell growth inhibitor
obtained from human lung cancer cells are reported in
Japanese Patent KOKAI Nos. 1-148197 and 1-187094, 
respectively.Some cell growth inhibitors are isolated also
from the fibroblastic 3T3 cell line established from the
cells obtained from Swiss fetal mice. For example, Natraj
et al. has reported that a growth inhibitor was obtained
from the cell surface of 3T3 cells in the stationary
phase, cf., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 75, 6115-6119
(1978). Harel et al. has reported that a growth inhibitor
having a molecular weight of 40 kDa was obtained from the
culture supernatant of 3T3 cells, see J. Cell. Physiol.,
119, 101-106 (1984), ibid., 123, 139-143 (1985). However,
these growth inhibitors all fail to show any significant
inhibitory action against tumor cells, as is known in the
art.The present inventors previously succeeded in
isolating, from the culture supernatant of 3T3 cell-derived
cell line, novel tumor cell growth inhibitors
having an activity of inhibiting the growth of tumor
cells, which was filed as Japanese Patent Application No.
3-11950.The tumor cell growth inhibitors exhibit a
potent growth inhibition activity against human
promyelogenous leukemia cells or human uterine cervical
cancer-derived cells and are expected to be effective for
the treatment of cancer.For use as new carcinostatic agents, it is
required to supply the tumor cell growth inhibitors in a 
sufficient amount. It is thus desired to develop a method
for production available with industrial advantages.The present inventors have brought
