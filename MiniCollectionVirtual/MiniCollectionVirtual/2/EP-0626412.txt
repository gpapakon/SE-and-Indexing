one phenylindane diamine and at least one aromatic bis(ether anhydride). The polyimide 

oligomers of the invention are readily processed to form solution prepregable polyimide 
composites having high glass transition temperatures and high temperature and oxidative 

stability. More particularly, the present invention provides for crosslinkable polyimide 
oligomers prepared by reacting, in a suitable solvent under an inert atmosphere, a mixture 

of monomers comprising: (A) an aromatic diamine component comprising from about 25 
to 100 mole % of at least one phenylindane diamine; (B) a dianhydride component 

comprising from about 25 to 100 mole % of at least one aromatic bis(ether anhydride); 
and (C) at least one end-cap monomer selected from the group consisting of monoanhydrides, 

acyl halides and aromatic amines, wherein each end-cap monomer contains at 
least one crosslinkable functional group in the molecule. The crosslinkable polyimide 

oligomers of the present invention are characterized by a number average molecular 
weight of from about 1000 to about 15000.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyimide oligomers having high thermal and oxidative 
stability and to methods for their manufacture. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to polyimides oligomers that can be readily prepregged and cured to form advanced 
composites having aerospace applications. Polymer-based composite materials are used in applications requiring performance at 
temperatures ranging from below ambient to 260°C. Typical applications include: 
compressor blades, ducts, splitters and thrust-vectoring flaps for jet engines, missile fins, 
wing components, radar domes, and other aerospace structures. Polyimide resins have 
been employed in such applications due to their high temperature and thermal stability 
properties. Polyimide resins are generally produced either by condensation polymerization directly or 
by addition polymerization followed by a condensation rearrangement reaction to form the 
heterocyclic rings. Accordingly, H2O is a reaction product in either case and creates 
inherent difficulties in producing void-free composites. Voids have a deleterious effect on 
the shear strength, flexural strength, and dielectric properties of polyimide based 
composites. In order to achieve high performance it has been previously proposed to use fully 
prereacted thermoplastic polyimides as the composite matrix. However, in this case the 
softening point or Tg of the polyimide resin must be substantially above the intended 
use-temperature. Accordingly, a very high processing temperature is required which has 
the risk of causing pyrolytic degradation of the resin. Moreover, the pressure needed to 
achieve the required resin flow often is higher than commercially available equipment is 
capable of sustaining. In recent years, attempts have been made to resolve certain of these disadvantages. For 
example, in U.S. patents 3,528,950, 3,745,149 and 3,083,081, polyimides are prepared 
from coreacting certain polyfunctional amines, polyfunctional anhydrides and end-capping  
 
monoanhydrides in an attempt to alleviate processing, stability and economic disadvantages. More recently, certain soluble polyimides, such as those described in Bateman et al U.S. 
Patent 3,856,752 which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, have 
been described Such polyimides are prepared by utilizing diaminodiphenylindane and 
aromatic dianhydrides. The resultant polyimides exhibit numerous advantages over the 
polyimides of the prior art but still encounter certain processing problems
