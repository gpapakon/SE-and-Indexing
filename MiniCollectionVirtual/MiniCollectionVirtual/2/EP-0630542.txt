<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid fiber in the loop telephony system. The system provides for highly reliable telephone service, even during electric utility company power failures. The system generally includes an ONU (4) for conversion of optical signals to electrical, digital signals. The electrical, digital signals are transmitted to a subscriber location (12). The subscriber location utilizes an NID (20) having a ring generator (306) and analog-to-digital conversion equipment (304). Mechanical features of the system are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HYBRID FIBER IN THE LOOP TELEPHONY SYSTEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of telephony systems and methods of operation thereof. For instance, in one embodiment the invention provides an improved telephony system having fiber or other digital media based digital signal transmission combined with metallic based signal transmission to the subscriber. Fiber based telephony networks have become increasingly commonplace in recent years. Fiber based systems have a wide variety of advantages over metallic transmission systems including vastly higher bandwidth. Unfortunately, most subscriber facilities in the United States telephone system and elsewhere continue to rely on metallic (generally copper) based transmission media.One important limitation in the transmission of telephone signals to the home in such hybrid systems has been the need for powering the subscribers telephone equipment. Since optical fibers do not conduct electricity, it is apparent that other facilities must be provided for power transmission to the central office and subscriber. Accordingly, telephony systems have been developed which provide for transmission of optical signals to a centralized location such as a central office. Such signals are converted to electronic signals for final transmission to the subscriber. Those combined optical/electronic transmission systems are commonly referred to as "hybrid" systems. This problem is made particularly difficult because FCC communications require that the telephone operating company supply enough power to ring five standard telephone extensions on every telephone line. Since standard phones have high ring- power requirements, such systems must be designed with substantial capacity.One prior system for providing power in a hybrid system is illustrated in Fig. l, such systems 

commonly referred to today as "fiber to the curb" or "FTTC" systems. As shown therein, a fiber 2 is used to communicate optical digital data signals to a optical network unit (ONU) 4. The ONU is placed in a neighborhood near a subscriber location and is referred to herein as a "curbside" ONU.Optical/electronics (O/E) conversion system 6 converts the optical signals to a serial bit stream of electronic digital signals for transmission to multiplexing/demultiplexing system 8. Multiplexing/ demultiplexing system 8 converts the serial bit stream from the O/E convertor to a plurality of digital signals. These digital signals are converted to analog signals in digital/analog,
