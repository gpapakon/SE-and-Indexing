<ABSTRACT>
A tool for shaping workpieces (22, 46, 103) has a movable punch (6, 31, 45, 75) and a feed device for its feed motion. According to the invention, the feed device has a coarse-feed device (7, 47, 80) for the rapid feed of the punch (6, 31, 45, 75) until it comes in contact with the workpiece (22, 46, 103) as well as a fine-feed mechanism (15, 24, 51, 81) for the further feed of the punch (6, 31, 45, 75) for the purpose of shaping the workpiece (22, 46, 103), the fine-feed mechanism (15, 24, 51, 81) having defined initial and end positions and being coupled to the coarse-feed device (7, 47, 80) in such a way that the fine-feed mechanism (15, 24, 51, 81) is displaced in the direction of its end position when the coarse-feed device (7, 47, 80) is actuated.

(15, 24, 51, 81) has defined starting and end positions is coupled 

to the coarse feed mechanism (7, 47, 80) in such a manner that 
the fine feed gearing (15, 24, 51, 81) is adjusted when operating 

the coarse feed mechanism (7, 47, 80) in the direction of its end 
position. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the fine feed 
gearing (15, 24, 51, 81) is positioned between the coarse feed 

mechanism (7, 47, 80) and the processing punch (6, 31, 45, 75) 
so that the distance between the latters is changeable by means 

of the fine feed gearing (15, 24, 51, 81). 
Tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the fine 
feed gearing (15, 24, 51, 81) comprises a release mechanism 

(19) which becomes operational in the area of the end position 
and permits a return movement of the processing punch (6, 31, 

45, 75). 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
coarse feed mechanism (7) and the processing punch (6) are via 

a resilient connecting element (14) coupled in parallel to the fine 
feed gearing (15), and the connecting element (14) keeps the 

coarse feed mechanism (7) and the processing punch (6) during 
rapid feed at such distance that the fine feed gearing (15) 

remains disengaged, and the connecting element (14) is so 
resilient that the fine feed gearing (15) engages at or after 

abutment of the processing punch (6) on the workpiece (22).  
 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
fine feed gearing (15) comprises a drive, and a switch or a clutch 

is provided which is operated on engagement of the fine feed 
gearing (15). 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the 
fine feed gearing (15, 24) is designed as a curved track gearing. 
Tool according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the curved 
track gearing (15, 25) comprises a rotatably mounted curved 

track element (16, 26) with a curved track (18, 30,. 33) having 
such incline so that a fine feed of the processing punch (6, 34) is 

caused when the curved track element (16, 26) is rotated. 
Tool according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the curved 
track element (15) is designed as a curved plate (16) with 

endsided curved track (18). 
Tool according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the curved 
track (18) has at the end of its incline a concavity (19). 
Tool according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterised in that
 a stop (23) 
for the curved track element (16) is provided and arranged in 

such a manner that the curved track element (16) moves during
