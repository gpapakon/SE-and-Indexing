<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the washing composition. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions for washing the human body which deliver oily components to the skin or hair. We have now determined that, foaming, mild washing compositions having an oily skin benefit can be formulated with: (a) an oily component; (b) one or more nonionic sugar-based surfactant, said surfactant being present in weight excess over the oily component, and; (c) a water soluble cationic polymer. Generally, the sugar based nonionic is selected from the group comprising aldonamides, alkylpolyglycosides and mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WASHING COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to washing compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions for washing the human body which deliver oily components to the skin or hair.It is well known to add oil to bath water so as to obtain a so-called skin benefit. It is also known to prepare compositions which contain both one or more oils and a surfactant so as to form an emulsion on dilution with water.EP 0366070 discloses bathing compositions comprising an oily- component (preferably a silicone oil, jojoba or olive oil, 2-ethyl hexanoic acid, squalene or cetyl octanoate) , a nonÂ¬ ionic surfactant (preferably a poly-oxyethylene alkyl ether) and a cationic polymer (preferably synthetic N,N-dimethyl- 3,5-methylenepiperidinium chloride polymer or distearyl- dimethyl-ammonium chloride polymer) . The compositions are generally pressed into a tablet so as to provide a convenient dosage form. In that document, it is said that the oily component forms an emulsion in water in the presence of the non-ionic surfactant and that the cationic polymer exerts a synergistic effect with the aforementioned emulsion to improve the texture of the skin and to suppressing dryness after bathing. The oil content of the bath water disclosed in EP 0366070 ranges from 2 to 500ppm, and the surfactant content of the product is such that it preferably ranges from 18-60wt% of the oil content, that is, the surfactant content is always less than the oil content so as to avoid foaming. 

The above-mentioned compositions have a skin benefit but do not clean well due to the low level of surfactant present. Moreover, while the presence of foam is undesirable in moisturising bathing compositions, many consumers require bathing or other washing compositions to foam. It is known that oils have a depressant effect on foam, eg. in fabric washing compositions silicone oils are used as antifoams as disclosed in US 3843558 and GB 1407997. Other oils are also known as antifoams.In addition, it is important that washing compositions are mild to the skin. While non-ionic surfactants are known to be particularly mild, especially as compared with anionic and cationic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants generally exhibit much worse foaming performance than ionic surfactants.From the above, having regard to the poor foaming properties of non-ionic surfactants and the anti-foam effects of oils, it can be seen that the preparation of a foaming, mild washing composition capable of depositing an oil on the skin presents
