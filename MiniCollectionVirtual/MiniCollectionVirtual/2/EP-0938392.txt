<ABSTRACT>
Sheet materials are superplastically formed and optionally diffusion bonded into structures, by directly electrically resistance heating the sheets and forming them with a controlled gas-mass flow while the dies (362) in which they are formed may remain relatively cool. The dies include electrodes and thermocouples placed therein, and gas interface ports that connect to the sheets to be formed to allow rapid formation of structures. Some of the gas interface ports may become sealably attached to the part during the formation process so that the structures may be removed from the dies hot, thus allowing a high die throughput.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of metal
forming and, more particularly, to the production forming
and diffusion bonding of metal sheets, which exhibit
superplastic characteristics, by directly electrically
resistance heating the sheets and forming them with a
controlled gas-mass flow, which has a capability of self-regulating
forming pressure according to the forming
temperature.Superplasticity is the characteristic
demonstrated by certain metal alloys that exhibit
extremely high plasticity. These alloys develop high
tensile elongations with minimum necking when deformed
within specific temperature ranges and limited strain
rate ranges. The methods used to form and in some cases
diffusion bond superplastic materials capitalize on this
characteristic and typically employ gas pressure to form
sheet material into or against a heated configurational
die in order to form the part. Normally the one or more
sheets to be formed are sealed about their perimeters
into a forming pack with gas pressure tubes welded to the
pack to communicate pressurized inert gas used to form
the part out of the forming pack. The edge and tube
welding usually must be done by hand and gas leaks from
faulty welds are a common cause of process failure.Once sealed around its perimeter, the forming
pack is placed between heated dies, that are usually
below superplastic forming temperature. The temperature
of the dies is then elevated so that the forming pack
gradually heats up to superplastic forming temperature.
No matter what the temperature of the dies when they are
loaded with sheets to be formed, a substantial time must
elapse before forming starts. The time enables the 
sheets to reach temperature equilibrium there across.
The sheets are heated conductively from the edges of the
dies, radiantly from the dies and to a lessor extent
convectively by atmospheric gas within the dies, which
are not particularly efficient heat transfer mechanisms.
It is critical in most superplastic forming processes,
which control the pressure of the forming gas that the
sheets of the forming pack be heated to a known,
controlled, uniform temperature since pressure control
relies on the superplastic characteristics from sheet to
sheet being identical, which in large measure depend on
the assumption that the sheets do not have a temperature
gradient there across.Pressurized inert gas is then used to form the
forming pack into the desired part in the dies. Before
the part can be removed from the dies, the dies and the
parts are cooled at least to the
