<ABSTRACT>
An image compression-coding device includes a 
level conversion circuit for adaptively reducing the 

amplitude of the quantification coefficient data based on 
statistical characteristics of the quantification coefficient 

data. The device further includes a selection 
circuit for selectively outputting either the 

quantification coefficient data after the level conversion 
or the quantification coefficient data before the 

level conversion, so that the image compression-coding 
device outputs a smaller amount of variable-length codes. 
Furthermore, a level conversion including a multiplier with a value 
between 0 and 0.5 is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
compression-coding apparatus and method for compressing
data of digital image signals.In a known system for efficiently compression-coding
two-dimensional images, image data is first
transformed using a two-dimensional discrete cosine
transform, (hereinafter, referred to as "DCT") then is
quantified, and is coded into a variable-length code.
Such a system is used in the JPEG International Standards.
Hereinafter, a conventional image
compression-coding apparatus using this system will be
described with reference to Figure 12.Figure 12 is a block diagram illustrating a
structure of a conventional image compression-coding
apparatus 3. Image data is input to the image compression-coding
apparatus 3 through a terminal 300. Next,
the image data is divided into a plurality of 8 x 8
blocks by a blocking circuit 310. The plurality of 8 x 8
blocks are each transformed into 8 x 8 (= 64) transform
coefficients by a DCT circuit 320. The transform coefficients
are arranged in a prescribed order by a zigzag
scan conversion circuit 330. Then, the transform coefficients
are quantified by a quantification circuit 340.
The quantification of the transform coefficients is
performed by dividing the transform coefficients by a
corresponding quantification value which is previously
stored in a quantification table 350. As a result of the 
quantification, quantification coefficient data is output
by the quantification circuit 340. The quantification
data is then coded into a variable-length code, namely,
a two-dimensional Huffman code and an additional bit by
a variable-length coding circuit 360. The
two-dimensional Huffman codes and the additional bit are
output through a terminal 370.The two-dimensional Huffman code is determined in
accordance with the combination of (1) the number of
successive zero quantification coefficient data and (2)
the group to which the non-zero quantification coefficient
data following the successive zero quantification
coefficient data belongs. The additional bit(s) is
determined so as to represent the value of the non-zero
quantification coefficient data in the group to which the
non-zero quantification coefficient data belongs. In
this specification, the length of the successive zero
quantification coefficient data will be referred to as
"Zero-Run". The combination of Zero-Run and the reference
number of the group which the non-zero
quantification coefficient data following the successive
zero quantification coefficient data belongs to will be
referred to
