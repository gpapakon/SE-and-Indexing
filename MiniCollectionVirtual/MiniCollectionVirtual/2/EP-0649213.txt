<ABSTRACT>
The provision of an electric rotating machine which can 
reduce the mechanical and thermal loads applied thereto. Coil 

arms (534, 537, 20b, 21b, 20d, 21d) and coil trunks (533, 536, 
20e, 21e) are provided in roughly parallel orientation to the end 

faces of an armature core (520, 11) only through insulating rings 
or spacers (560, 590, 20a, 21a, 20c, 21c). Metal brush (910, 81) 

is disposed on coil arms, whereby the overall length of the 
armature can be remarkably shortened. In addition, a commutator, 

conventionally necessary, can be eliminated, whereby the length 
of the production process for the armature can be reduced. 

Moreover, in an arrangement where projections (534c) of the upper 
coil arm are fit in holes of the insulating spacer, as the 

displacement of the upper coil arm towards the outer periphery 
is regulated, the length of axial protrusions of the upper coil 

arm from the end face of the armature core can be minimized. In 
addition, as extension portions (538, 20g, 20h) and of the coil 

trunks are strongly pressed against and fixed to the side of 
armature core by fixing members (570, 30), the resistance to the 

centrifugal force can be remarkably improved. Furthermore, as 
the extension portion of the lower coil arm is fit in a recessed 

part of the insulating spacer, the displacement of the lower coil 
arm in the axial direction towards the outer periphery can be 

prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric rotating machine 
according to the preamble of claim 1. An electric rotating machine of that type is known from 
FR-A-2 534 085. This known machine comprises an armature core 
which includes a plurality of recesses and a shaft for rotatably 
supporting the armature core. Each of these recesses 
houses an outer coil trunk and an inner coil trunk, wherein 
each of the inner coil trunks, on both end end parts thereof, 
comprises an inner coil arm which is disposed substantially 
perpendicularly to the shaft so as to extend towards the 
shaft. In a similar way, each of the outer coil trunks, on 
both end end parts thereof, comprises an outer coil arm which 
is disposed substantially perpendicularly to the shaft so as 
to extend towards the shaft. In order to complete the winding, 
the respective outer coil arm is connected, at the other 
end part thereof, to the other end part of an inner coil arm 
disposed in another one of the recesses. In this known machine, the recesses in the armature core 
are throughholes, the inner coil trunk being a flexible doublewire 
which is fed through a corresponding hole and subsequently 
bent so as to form the inner coil arms, whereas the 
outer coil trunk is a single wire at the ends of which a respective 
blade is attached by inserting a pin of the wire 
into a corresponding hole of the blade. The blade, which is 
reinforced by a resin is the outer coil arm and forms the 
commutator of the machine. A disadvantage of this known machine, therefore, has to 
be seen in that the fabrication of the winding is comparatively 
difficult so that the costs are correspondingly increased. 
Furtheron, the connection between the blade and the 
outer coil arm is subjected to great centrifugal forces and,  
 
thus, is likely to break if the speed of the motor exceeds a 
certain value. In EP-A-0 387 666, there is disclosed an armature of an 
electric rotating machine the winding of which is formed by a 
single one continuous flexible wire which, after being wound 
over the core, is completely moulded with resin. Therefore, 
this known armature cannot be compared to the winding structure 
as claimed in the preamble of claim 1. In DE-A-3 
813 317, there is disclosed some sort of winding units, the 
shape of the end away from the commutator, however, not being 
defined, i.e. whether it is formed as a loop or as two separate 
pieces. It is the object of the present invention to provide an 
electric rotating machine according to the preamble of claim
