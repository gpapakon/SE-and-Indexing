<ABSTRACT>
A terrain-travelling motor vehicle (1) having a pair of caterpillar bogies (2) pivotably attached to the frame (3) of the vehicle and comprising a rear pair of drive wheels (5) mounted on the frame (3) of the vehicle and a front pair of wheels (7), wherein each said wheel (7a) is supported on a pivotable belt tensioning arm (9) on the forward end of a bogie arm (8) provided in each bogie (2), which bogie arm is supported at the rear end thereof by means of shaft journals (4) proximate to and in front of the center axis of the rear pair of wheels (5). The bogie arms (8) with belt tensioning arms (9) are movable in the vertical plane by means of hydraulic pressure cylinders (6) for independent upward and downward pivoting of the bogies. The belt tensioning arms (9) are movable by means of respective hydraulic pressure cylinders (10) the ends of which are connected to the belt tensioning arm (9) and the bogie arm (8) for maintenance of the desired tautness in the bogie belt during the pivoting movement of the bogie arm (8), as well as during the continual changes in configuration of the lower part of the bogie belt. A belt supporting wheel (11) for the lower part of the belt is provided between the front and rear wheels (7a and 5a) of each bogie (2). An auxiliary bogie arm (8a) is pivotably mounted (15) at the center section thereof on the forward end of the bogie arm (8). The belt tensioning arm (9) with the front wheel (7a) and the belt supporting wheel (11), respectively, are provided at the forward and rearward end of the auxiliary bogie arm (8a). The one end of the pressure cylinder (10) opposite the belt tensioning arm (9) is supported on the auxiliary bogie arm (8a).

<DESCRIPTION>
 AN ASSEMBLY ON A TERRAIN-TRAVELLING MOTOR VEHICLEThe present invention relates to an assembly on a terrain- travelling motor vehicle having a pair of caterpillar bogies pivotably attached to the frame of the vehicle, as recited in the preamble of the appurtenant independent claim 1.A terrain-travelling motor vehicle of the type mentioned above is known from the applicant's own Norwegian Patent No. 148,219.According to said patent, a terrain-travelling vehicle is provided wherein the body of the vehicle is raised and lowered, optionally the bogie arms are raised and lowered independently of one another, to maintain a desired position of the vehicle body when driving over uneven ground, without this affecting the tautness of the belt.The maintenance of uniform tautness of the belt while driving over uneven ground is achieved in said patent by means of the pressure cylinder described in the introduction of the patent, which acts upon the belt-tensioning arm, being pressurized at a specific desired pressure. The tautness of the belt may at any time be decreased or increased by regulating said pressure depending on land conditions and independently of the up-and-down pivoting movements of the bogie, which take place with the aid of the pressure cylinder provided for the raising and lowering thereof.Despite the aforementioned possibilities for maintaining a desired belt tautness and the fact that the caterpillar bogie is capεble of altering position or being raised and lowered depending on the conditions of the land, the vehicle will assume a bumpy or rolling movement when driven over rugged terrain. This is due primarily to the fact that when one, or both of the caterpillar bogies drives into an obstacle in the form of a rock or stump, the forward wheel of the 

caterpillar bogie will climb the obstacle and thereby pivot the caterpillar bogie upward, with a corresponding transfer of movement to the vehicle frame.The purpose of the present invention is to provide a caterpillar bogie wherein said movement associated with collision with and climbing over an upwardly projecting obstacle is substantially moderated by virtue of the fact that the forward wheel of the caterpillar bogie is permitted to pivot upward at the same time as the center belt support¬ ing wheel between the forward and rear bogie wheels is pivoted downward. This enables the forward wheel of the caterpillar bogie to climb up over the obstacle at the same time as the belt supporting wheel is pressed downward and raises or turns the caterpillar

1.
An assembly on a terrain-travelling motor vehicle (1) having a pair of caterpillar bogies (2) pivotably attached to the frame (3) of the vehicle and comprising a rear pair of drive wheels (5) mounted on the frame (3) of the vehicle and a front pair of wheels (7), wherein each said wheel (7a) is supported on a pivotable belt tensioning arm (9) on the forward end of a bogie arm (8) provided in each bogie (2), which bogie arm is supported at the rear end thereof by means of shaft journals (4) proximate to and in front of the center axis of the rear pair of wheels (5), said bogie arms (8) with belt tensioning arms (9) being movable in the vertical plane by means of hydraulic pressure cylinders (6) control¬ lable from the cab of the vehicle, for pivoting the bogies upward and downward simultaneously or independently of each other, and wherein the belt tensioning arms (9) are movable independently of the bogie arms (S) by means of respective hydraulic pressure cylinders (10) the ends of which are connected to the belt tensioning arm (9) and the bogie arm (8), and which are pressurized at a desired adjustable pressure for maintaining a desired tautness in the bogie belt during the pivoting movement of the bogie arm (8), as well as during the continual changes in configuration of the lower part of bogie belt which occur during driving over uneven ground, and a belt supporting wheel (11) for the lower part of the belt provided between the front and rear wheels (7a and 5a) of each bogie (2), c h a r a c t e r i z e d by an auxiliary bogie arm (8a) pivotably mounted (15) at the center section thereof on the forward end of the bogie arm (8), and at the forward and rearward end of which the belt tensioning arm (9) with the front wheel (7a) and the belt supporting wheel (11), respectively, are provided, and wherein the one end of the pressure cylinder (10) opposite the belt tensioning arm (9) is supported on the auxiliary bogie arm (8a). 


2.
The assembly according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the auxiliary bogie arm (8a) is supported in a downwardly projecting shank (16) on the bogie arm (8).
3.
The assembly according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that said one end of the pressure cylinder (10) is supported proximate to the support of the auxiliary bogie arm (8a) on the bogie arm (8).
4.
The assembly according to one of the claims 1 - 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the distance (A) from the support (15) for the auxiliary bogie arm (8a) to the support for the front wheel (7) is equal to or greater than the distance (B) from the support for the auxiliary bogie arm (8a) to the support for the belt supporting wheel.
