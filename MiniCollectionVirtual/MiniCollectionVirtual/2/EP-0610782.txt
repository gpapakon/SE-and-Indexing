<ABSTRACT>
A wheel hub unit (1) in which an inner ring of a rolling 
bearing acts as a wheel hub and is rigidly connected to 

an outer cap (28) of a constant-velocity universal joint 
(4); the inner ring is formed by a first element (13) 

having a first race for the rolling bodies and a sleeve-shaped 
connecting portion (19) and a second annular 

element (15) provided with a second race for the rolling 
bodies, which is fixed to a first length (23) of the 

sleeve-shaped portion (19) so as to be rigid for rotation 
therewith, the second element (15) being in abutment with 

an axial shoulder (21) of the first element adjacent the 
first race and being axially locked thereagainst by means 

of the plastic deformation of a stop member (35); the cap 
of the joint being coupled with a second, splined length 

(29) of the sleeve-shaped portion (19) on which it is 
axially snap engaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel hub unit 
particularly for a drive/steering wheel of a motor 
vehicle. The wheel hub units 
as specified in the preamble of Claim 1, e.g. of vehicle drive 
wheels as disclosed in GB-A-2088526, are usually 
formed by the connection, with various degrees of 
integration, of a constant-velocity universal joint with 
a rolling bearing with two rings of balls, in which one 
of the rings of the bearing is adapted to fulfil the 
functions of a wheel hub while the other is fixed to the 
suspension strut (or itself fulfils the functions of the 
strut). The known solutions provide a simple mechanical 
coupling for the transmission of torque between the joint 
and the bearing, these latter remaining as two separate 
components or there being an integration of mechanical 
parts between the two components, with the use both of 
constant-velocity universal joints provided with a shank 
on which there is integrally formed at least one half-element 
of one of the rings of the bearing, and of 
bearings of which the inner ring, of suitably large 
dimensions and suitable conformation also fulfils the 
function of the outer cap of the joint (fourth generation 
units). The integrated solutions reduce the number of component  
 
elements but are disadvantageous in the case of 
breakdowns of only one of the components of the unit (the 
bearing or the joint) in that they require the 
replacement of the entire unit with consequent increased 
costs. Moreover, the dimensions of the joint are 
constrained by the bulk of the bearing whereby it is not 
possible to use the same unit for vehicles (for example 
belonging to the same range) of substantially the same 
weight but of different powers, at least not without 
using a larger and heavier solution for the joint. When 
the inner ring of the bearing and the cap of the joint 
are formed as a single component, moreover, manufacture 
of the parts, assembly and testing of the unit are 
particularly complicated and onerous. Finally, the known solutions make it impossible, or at 
least extremely difficult, to fit the wheel hub unit 
automatically to the vehicle since either the two 
elements (bearing and joint) must first be pre-assembled 
and handled as an inseparable unit or they are connected 
at the moment of assembly on the vehicle with the need to 
force fit the splined part of the joint in the hub and 
effect the axial clamping with a controlled torque on the 
assembly line, which operations are wasteful in terms of 
time and equipment.

<CLAIMS>
A wheel hub unit (1) for a vehicle, including a rolling bearing (3) comprising 
in turn first and second support members (5,7) mounted so as to be mutually 

rotatable and a double ring of rolling bodies (9) interposed between said 
members, and a joint (4) for transmitting torque to said first member of the 

bearing ; said first member (5) being formed as two mutually coupled circular 
elements (13,15) and being shaped so as to define a wheel hub for a wheel of 

the vehicle; and the joint (4) including an outer member (28) angularly and 
axially connected to the first member of the bearing (3); wherein said first 

support member (5) comprises: a first element (13) provided with attachment 
means for the wheel, with a first race for the rolling bodies (9) and with a 

sleeve- shaped connecting portion (19) extending from an axial shoulder (21) 
of said first element formed adjacent said first race; and a second element (15) 

having an annular shape and provided with a second race for the rolling bodies 
(9), said second element (15) being fixed to a first length (23) of the sleeve-shaped 

portion of said first element (13), so as to be rigid for rotation therewith, 
and being in abutment with said axial shoulder (21) and axially locked 

thereagainst by a plastically deformed stop member (35;41);
 
   
characterized
 in that said outer member (28) of the joint (4) is cup-shaped 
and is coupled in a releasable manner with a second length (29) of said 

sleeve-shaped portion in a position immediately adjacent the second element 
(15), said coupling ensuring said angular and axial connection between said 

outer member (28) and said first element (13).

upon the said length (29). 
A wheel hub unit (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2, characterised in that the said second element (15) is

keying on said first length (23) of the sleeve-shaped

tempering and having a tempered region (36) only in
