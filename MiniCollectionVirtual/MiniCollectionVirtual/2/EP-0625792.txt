<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in a sputter deposition apparatus and 
process for sputtering is described wherein the surface of 

the sputtering target (11), adjacent its outer edge, is 
provided with a taper (14) which reduces the redeposition 

rate thereon of back scattered atoms previously sputtered 
from the target surface. When the sputtering apparatus 

includes a magnetrom (40), the modified target (11) acts 
to decrease the distance of the ions in the plasma from 

the magnetron to thereby increase the deposition rate 
adjacent the tapered portion of the target. The angle α 

of the tapered portion (14) of the target, with respect to 
the central portion of the target surface, must be at 

least about 30°, and preferably varies from about 35° 
to about 70°, and most preferably from about 40° to 

about 60°. In a preferred embodiment, a second taper 
(16) extends outwardly of the first taper (15) to provide 

a more uniform gap (d) between the outer edge of the 
target (11') and the portion (31) of the shield (30) 

parallel to the wall of the sputtering apparatus. The 
angle of the second tapered surface will range from about 

70° to about 85°, with respect to the central portion 
of the target surface, preferably from about 75° to 

about 83°, and typically from about 78° to about 
80°. That is the angle of the outermost tapered surface 

on the sputtering target, with respect to a plane 
perpendicular to the central portion of the target 

surface, may vary from about 5° to about 20°, 
preferably from about 7° to about 15°, and typically 

from about 10° to about 12°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a process for sputtering which is useful in 
the formation of integrated circuit structures on semiconductor wafers. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus and a process for increasing the 
uniformity of the sputtering rate of sputtering apparatus useful in the formation of 
integrated circuit structures on semiconductor wafers. In the deposition of materials onto a substrate by sputtering from a target, the 
sputtered atoms from the target are scattered in various directions, including back to 
the target where they may then be resputtered by the ions, e.g., argon ions, 
impinging on the target. However, sputtered atoms which are scattered back to 
redeposit on the target do not adhere well to the target. Therefore, if such atoms are 
not resputtered, they may build up as a poorly bonded mass of materials which 
eventually flake off, giving rise to undesirable particle formation in the deposition 
chamber. Unfortunately, the sputtering rate is not uniform across the entire face of the target, 
in part due to the presence of a grounded shield adjacent the periphery of the target 
which serves to protect the walls of the deposition chamber from deposition of the 
sputtered atoms. Thus, while the scattering and redeposition of sputtered atoms in 
the chamber is fairly uniform, sputtering of the redeposited atoms (i.e., resputtering) 
is not uniform, with less of the redeposited atoms being resputtered adjacent the 
periphery of the target (which is usually circular in shape).  
 When a single material such as a metal, e.g., titanium, is being sputtered, the 
sputtering rate is usually sufficient that the above-described redeposition does not 
create a problem. That is, the resputtering rate is still sufficient to inhibit excessive 
build up of redeposited metal at the edges of the target. However, when reactive sputtering is carried out in the deposition reactor, wherein 
the sputtered metal atoms react with a gas in the chamber to form a metal compound 
on the surface where the metal atoms deposit, such a metal compound may have a 
lower sputter rate than the metal itself. When the sputtered metal atoms redeposits 
on the target surface and react with the reactive gas to form the metal compound, this 
metal compound is sometimes resputtered at an insufficient rate to prevent or inhibit 
the undesirable build up of a poorly adherent mass, thus giving rise to the above 
described undesirable formation of particles in the chamber as the metal
