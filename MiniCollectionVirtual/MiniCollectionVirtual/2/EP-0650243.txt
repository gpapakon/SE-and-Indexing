<ABSTRACT>
A brush assembly 45 for an electric motor has a brush arm 39 with a distal end 
arranged for making sliding contact with a commutator, a brush holder 38 for 

supporting the brush arm, a motor terminal 37 and a PTC 46 for electrical protection. 
The brush holder 38, PTC 46 and motor terminal 37 form a stacked array within the 

motor held together by resilient clamping means, e.g., a resilient finger 60 or a spring 
clip 70.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brush assembly for an electric motor and in particular to a 
brush assembly incorporating a positive coefficient thermistor for use in a miniature 
DC motor. It is known to protect motors from overcurrent and/or overtemperature by means of 
switching devices, either mechanical switches, for example, bimetal switches, or solid 
state switches such as positive temperature coefficient devices (PTCs) and in 
particular, positive coefficient thermistors of either the ceramic or polymer type. The use of PTCs as thermal switches or current switches in low voltage and extra low 
voltage DC motors is well known. The rapid rise in resistance at its operating 
temperature, its self-heating and self-resetting qualities make it ideal. Although these 
devices can be mounted outside the motor, modern designs require the outside of the 
motor to be free of unnecessary obstructions. Therefore, PTCs are generally mounted 
within the motor, preferably in the end cap electrically between a motor terminal and a 
brush although they may be mounted on the rotor or elsewhere. As the size of the 
motor decreases, the positioning of the PTC becomes more critical, leading to the 
various designs, see for example, GB 2222730A, GB 2244868A and EP 0453575A. EP 0453575 describes the use of a resin type PTC thermistor in a small DC-motor in 
which the PTC is connected in series with the armature winding. Various 
embodiments are shown including an embodiment in which the PTC is located between 
a terminal and a brush arm of the motor. The PTC appears to be fixed to the terminal 
and brush arm by an electrically conductive adhesive resin. It is desirable to avoid the use of conductive adhesives within a miniature motor end 
cap due to cost, resistance level of the adhesive and the time taken during assembly to 
apply the adhesive and for the adhesive to set. Also, it is desirable to avoid the use of 
any adhesives in a miniature motor end cap to avoid possible contamination of other 
parts which may occur while handling the end cap before the adhesive sets. The use of slots in the end cap for wedging the PTC in between the terminal and the 
brush arm to form an electrical connection is not satisfactory for production as the  
 
PTCs and in particular, resin based PTCs, do not have an accurate or consistent 
thickness. Therefore, although the slot can be formed in the plastics material end cap 
precisely and the thickness of terminal and brush arm can be precisely controlled, the 
thickness of the combined
