<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a magnet system (1) for generating a steady 
magnetic field in a measurement space (29), a coil system (3) for generating gradient 

fields in the measurement space, and at least one RF coil (9) which is accommodated in 
a housing (33) which can be arranged in the measurement space and which is also 

suitable to accommodate an object (41) to be examined. The apparatus also comprises a 
jig for positioning an instrument (57) to be introduced into the object (41) to be 

examined. This jig comprises a first stop (59) for defining the position of a free end of 
the instrument (57) in a first coordinate direction (Z) of a three-dimensional system of 

coordinates. The jig also comprises a perforated plate (55) which is provided with holes 
(53) which are arranged in a matrix which extends according to second and third 

coordinate directions (X, Y) of the coordinate system in order to position the instrument 
(57) in the second and third coordinate directions. The location of a coordinate axis 

extending parallel to the second or the third coordinate direction (X, Y) is defined by a 
first phantom (71) which is rigidly arranged in the housing (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic resonance apparatus, comprising a
magnet system arranged to generate a steady magnetic field in a measurement space, a coil
system arranged to generate gradient fields in the measurement space, and at least one RF coil
which is accommodated in a housing which can be arranged in the measurement space
and which is arranged to accommodate an object to be examined, the apparatus also
comprising a jig for positioning an instrument to be introduced into the object to be
examined, which jig comprises a first stop for defining the position of a free end of the
instrument in a first coordinate direction of a three-dimensional system of coordinates.An apparatus of this kind is known from US-A-5,155,435. In the known
apparatus the jig comprises a guide which is connected to the frame of the apparatus via
a number of ball joints and adjustable connection means and which serves to guide the
instrument which may consist of, for example a needle for carrying out a biopsy. The
object to be examined, for example a part of the body of a patient, must first be
introduced into the apparatus in order to form an image thereof in the absence of the
instrument. This image is stored in a memory, after which the patient is removed from
the apparatus. Using this image, the desired position of the instrument is determined
and the jig is adjusted accordingly. Subsequently, the patient is introduced into the
apparatus again; the position of the patient must be accurately the same as during the
formation of the first image. Finally, using the jig, the instrument is introduced into the
part of the body to be examined, it then being possible, if desired, to make a second
image. This procedure is time-consuming and comparatively strenuous to the patient,
because the patient must be moved into and out of the apparatus a few times. Moreover,
very high requirements are imposed in respect of the accuracy with which the patient is
positioned when introduced into the apparatus for the second time.Document DE-A-38 31 278 discloses a stereotactics apparatus
comprising a frame fixed on a head of a patient to be
imaged via a magnetic resonance apparatus. A marker
member is fixed to the frame, such that displaying of
the marker member together with the head on a
magnetic resonance image allows to reconstruct the
coordinate system, and hence the coordinates of the
surgical target can be accurately calculated
without the necessity of moving the patient into and
out of the magnetic resonance apparatus several
