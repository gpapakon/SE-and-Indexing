<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a method for interference-proof bidirectional transmission of digital information via power distribution networks which gives rise to an advantageously designed device in which both the transmitting signals are generated digitally and the received signals are corelatively processed digitally. According to the invention, this makes use of a large proportion of the system resources both for transmitting and for receiving operation. The invention leads to a modem concept with high flexibility with regard to the most important system parameters such as data rate, interference-resistance, signal shaping and frequency selection. A modem constructed in accordance with the invention contains a signal shape synthesizer (12, 13), which is synchronized with the alternating power system voltage, an arithmetic logic unit (8) for the correlative digital processing of the received signal, a microcontroller, microprocessor or digital circuit of comparable function (10) as major components. In addition to the signal shape synthesizer (12, 13) and the digital circuit (10), a coupler (2) and a power system zero crossing detector (25) are used both in transmitting and in receiving operation. The presence of a microcontroller allows the transmitting section to be advantageously constructed with little complexity.
