<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical amplifier for use in optical fiber
communication systems and optical signal processing systems.This application is based on patent application No. Hei 11-197126, the content of
which is incorporated herein by reference.The basic configuration of a conventional optical amplifier is shown in Figure 22.
This optical amplifier is comprised by two amplifying sections having different gain band
regions (L-amplifying section and S-amplifying section), a divider, and a combiner, and
attempts to broaden the operational bandwidths by coupling the two gain band regions in the
wavelength domain. (refer to "Broadband and gain-flattened amplifier composed of a 1.55
µm-band and a 1.58 µm-band Er3+-doped fiber amplifier in a parallel configuration", M.
Yamada et. al., IEE Electronics Letters, Vol. 33, No. 8, 1977, pp710-711) (Reference 1).Various types of dividers and combiners are utilized in constructing such optical
amplifiers, and they can be classified as a dielectric multi-layer filter or a combination of fiber
grating in association with circulator. Those based on dielectric multi-layer filter are reported
in the following references.
