<ABSTRACT>
An optical signal transmission network comprises a main optical 
fibre (8) having a 

plurality of branch circuits (11,12), with each final branch circuit of a 
chain of branches ending 

in a terminal unit (15,16,17), and the network being associated with 
OTDR equipment () connected 

so as to transmit an output signal through the main fibre (8) and the 
branch circuits (11,12), 

wherein each said final branch circuit incorporates a filter (25,26,27) 
which is capable of reflecting 

back towards the OTDR equipment () at least one wavelength in the 
OTDR band, but not traffic wavelengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical signal transmission networks, as may be used,
for example, in optical fibre telecommunications, and relates, in particular, to a fault
location and diagnostic systems for use with such networks.Over the past decade, optical time domain reflectometry, hereinafter referred
to as OTDR, has become an established tool for the location and evaluation of the
features on an optical fibre route. For example, OTDR techniques are now commonly
used to determine both the position and loss of splices and connectors and the
position of line breads as well as providing a means for making single-ended, real-time
system loss measurements.In use of an optical time domain reflectometer a short pulse of light is launched
into an optical fibre under test and the backscattered signal is monitored as a function
of the time of flight (or equivalently distance) along the fibre. The magnitude of the
backscattered signal depends on the Rayleigh scattering, attenuation,
inhomogeneities, splices, components and the optical power level in the fibre.
Features in the trace of backscatter versus time may then be correlated with the
presence of discontinuities and disruptions in the fibre route.Whilst OTDR techniques are extremely valuable as a diagnostic tool for the
location of faults in simple point to point links there is now an increasing trend towards
more complex passive optical networks. In such networks a number of branch circuits may emanate from a single optical
fibre connected, for example to a telephone exchange, and the branch circuits may be
further divided into further branch circuits, with each final branch circuit of a chain of
branches ending in a respective terminal unit, for example at a customer's premises.
Such an arrangement can provide a significant cost reduction by utilising the available
bandwidth to share said single exchange fibre amongst a number of customers, thereby
reducing the level of exchange equipment and fibre installation costs borne by each
customer.It will, however, be apparent that when a signal from OTDR equipment is
transmitted along said single fibre, and thence to the branch circuits, the signal which is
returned at any instant, following the transmission of an output signal from the OTDR
equipment, will be made up of light backscattered from many points in the network at the
same distance from the equipment. This makes the location of a fault in the network
difficult and time-consuming.An object of the invention is to provide a means of simplifying such

Fault location apparatus for use in an optical signal transmission network of a type
which includes a main optical fibre (8) having a plurality of branch fibres (11,12,13,14),

in which each final branch fibre (11,12) of a chain of branches ends in a terminal unit

optical transmission network (8,11,12,12,14) adapted to transmit an output signal through

the main fibre (8) and the branch fibres (11,12,13,14); and 
characterised in that

towards the OTDR equipment a wavelength or wavelengths unique to that branch in the

OTDR band, but not traffic wavelengths, and wherein said OTDR (1,2,3) equipment is
operated to make measurement on a "virtual" or "mirror" image of the path from the

terminal unit (15,16,17) and has means for distinguishing the signals returned from
individual final branch fibres (11, 13, 14).
Fault location apparatus, according to Claim 1, in which each filter (25,26,27) is
disposed in the traffic line (11,13,14) and is substantially transmissive to traffic

wavelengths.
Fault location apparatus, according to Claim 1, in which each filter (25,26,27) is
disposed in a spur line connected to the traffic line and is such as to transmit or attenuate

traffic wavelengths. 
Fault location apparatus, according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, wherein each filter
(25,26,27) is switchable between a first condition in which it transmits or attenuates

wavelengths in the OTDR band, and a second condition in which it reflects wavelengths
in the OTDR band, and means are provided for switching said filters (25,26,27)

individually into said second condition whilst maintaining the remaining filters
(25,26,27) in the first condition.
