<ABSTRACT>
A state of charge indicator (10) monitors a voltage 
produced by a depletable energy source (11) and provides an 

indication when the state of charge of the depletable 
energy source (11) falls below a predetermined threshold. 

The state of charge indicator (10) includes an input 
circuit (13) for sensing the voltage and producing a 

plurality of tap voltages. The state of charge indicator 
(10) further includes a monitor circuit (65) for comparing 

each tap voltage with a corresponding threshold voltage and 
producing a result for each tap voltage falling below its 

corresponding threshold. The state of charge indicator 
(10) still further includes a storage device (75, 95, 115) 

for storing each result and producing an accumulated status 
and an output circuit (152) for producing the indication 

when the accumulated status exceeds an accumulated status 
threshold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a state of 
charge indicator for providing an indication when the state 
of charge of a depletable energy source falls below a 
predetermined threshold. The present invention is more 
particularly directed to a state of charge indicator for 
monitoring a voltage produced by a battery used in a deep 
cycle application and producing an indication when the 
state of charge of the battery falls below a predetermined 
threshold. The state of charge of a depletable energy source such 
as a battery is an indication of the relative amount of 
useable energy remaining in the battery. The state of 
charge is given as a percentage equal to the ratio of the 
present amount of useable energy remaining in the battery 
to the amount of useable energy in the battery when it is 
fully charged. Thus, a fully-charged battery has a 100% 
state of charge, a fully-discharged battery has a 0% state 
of charge, and a battery charged to a level equal to one-half 
its full state of charge has a 50% state of charge. Batteries are often used in deep cycle applications to 
provide electrical energy to power electrical devices such 
as electric motors or emergency lighting. In deep cycle 
applications, batteries are routinely and repetitively 
discharged to a relatively low state of charge and 
recharged to a near-100% state of charge. In other 
applications, batteries such as starting batteries in 
automobiles, for example, are used only intermittently, to 
supply electrical energy to the starter motor of the 
automobile. Aside from these momentary intermittent 
usages, such batteries are generally maintained near 100% 
state of charge. Deep cycle applications, in contrast, 
routinely discharge the battery to a low state of charge 
during normal usage.  Typical deep cycle applications for a battery include 
providing power to an electric trolling motor in a fishing 
boat, providing power to the electric drive system of a 
battery-operated wheelchair, or emergency power for 
security systems. In such applications, the battery may be 
required to supply current for several hours. Supplying 
this current will discharge the battery to a relatively low 
state of charge. Later, the battery may be recharged to a 
nearly 100% state of charge. This same cycle of 
discharging and recharging the battery may be repeated many 
times over the life of the battery. In view of these typical applications, it would be 
advantageous to provide a battery with a state of charge 
indicator. Such an indicator
