<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for generating a surface 
profile (13) on a thermoplastic road marking (12) 

through the application of a profiled embossing wheel 
(9) to the road marking (12) is disclosed. The 

embossing wheel (9) is mounted a predetermined distance 
behind the road marking applicator (3) on a single 

vehicle (1) so as to allow accurate control of the time 
between the application of the road marking (12) and 

the passage of the embossing wheel (9) so as to provide 
consistent results tailored to the hardening time of 

the thermoplastic road marking (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for providing a road marking, such as a centre line, 
which is profiled in order to provide improved wet 
night visibility. Road markings such as centre lines, hazard lines 
and lane markings generally are based on thermoplastic 
materials or solvent- and water-based paints. 
Thermoplastic road markings have the advantage of a 
relatively short hardening time, and may therefore be 
driven over not long after being applied. This allows 
traffic disruption to be kept relatively low. The 
marking is applied by heating the thermoplastic mixture 
and applying it in a controlled manner onto a prepared 
road surface by way of a hot spray, screeding or 
extrusion process. In order to ensure good night 
visibility of the road marking, small glass beads may 
be mixed in with the marking mixture and/or applied to 
the surface of the mixture after it has been applied, 
but before it has hardened. These glass beads have 
predetermined refractive and reflective properties, and 
are designed to reflect light from vehicle headlamps 
back towards the driver. While this provides good 
night visibility in dry conditions, even relatively 
light rain can drastically reduce the visibility of the 
road marking by submerging the glass beads which 
protrude from the surface of the marking, thus altering 
the refractive and reflective properties of the surface 
as a whole. In order to overcome this deficiency, it is known 
to generate a profile in the road marking as it is 
being laid by using a shutter-controlled screed 
process. By adjusting the shutter, it is possible to 
vary the thickness of the screeded road marking in 
order to produce an uneven top surface. If such a 
marking becomes wet, the water will tend to drain from  
 
the higher regions of the surface, exposing the glass 
beads located at these regions, and thereby restoring 
some degree of reflectivity. This shutter-controlled 
method, however, generates a relatively high, square-edged 
profile, which is unsuitable in many 
applications. Furthermore, the square-edged profile 
presents only one face to oncoming traffic, which 
limits the direction in which the glass beads reflect. It is also known, from EP 0 124 946 (Moses 
Bollag), to apply a profile to a paint-based road 
marking after it has been applied. This is done by 
first applying a stretch of paint-based road marking, 
and subsequently rolling a profiled rubber tyre along 
the road marking, after it has been laid but before the 
paint has dried. EP 0 124

<CLAIMS>
A method of generating a surface profile on a 
thermoplastic road marking (12), wherein, a 

predetermined time after the road marking (12) has been 
applied but before it has hardened, a profiled 

embossing wheel (9) is rolled along the road marking 
(12) in order to generate a complementary surface 

profile (13) on the road marking (12). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein a 
coolant is applied to the road marking (12) after it 

has been laid and before passage of the embossing wheel 
(9). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
coolant is applied to or through the embossing wheel 

(9). 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein reflective glass beads are applied to the road 

marking (12) before passage of the embossing wheel (9) 
so that the embossing wheel (9) at least partly pushes 

the glass beads into the road marking (12). 
A road marking apparatus comprising 
application means (3) for applying a thermoplastic road 

marking (12) to a road surface (4) and a profiled 
embossing wheel (9) for generating a complementary 

surface profile (13) on the road marking (12), wherein 
the embossing wheel (9) is disposed at a predetermined 

location behind the application means (3). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein 
the embossing wheel (9) is resiliently mounted on the 

apparatus. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6, 
wherein the embossing wheel (9) is mounted on the 

apparatus by way of a joint which allows the embossing 
wheel (9) to maintain its orientation with respect to 

the road surface (4) regardless of the relative 
 

orientation, within predetermined limits, of the main 
body (1) of the apparatus. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7, 
wherein the embossing wheel (9) is provided with one or 

more coolant channels. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 5 to 
8, wherein the embossing wheel (9) is releasably 

mounted on the apparatus. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 5 to 
9, wherein the apparatus is arranged so that the width 

of the embossing wheel (9) is greater than the width of 
the thermoplastic road marking (12) to which the 

surface profile (13) is applied.
