<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk apparatus comprises a spindle motor 
(2) for revolving an optical disk, a motor (54) driver 

for supplying a drive signal to the spindle motor (2), 
and a frequency comparator (52) for comparing an FG 

pulse generated from a pulse generator (50) and a 
spindle motor clock generated from a clock control 

circuit (56). A CPU (23) transmits a drive signal to 
the motor driver (54) such that a difference signal 

supplied from the frequency comparator becomes zero. 
In order to decelerate the spindle motor (2), the CPU 

(23) computes stop time of the spindle motor (2) in 
advance based on a constant revolution speed, a decelerating 

revolution speed of the spindle motor (2) being 
decelerated, and time required until the constant revolution 

speed reaches the decelerating revolution speed, 
and no power for stopping the motor (2) is applied from 

the motor driver to the spindle motor at the stop time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk 
apparatus for recording/reproducing information on/from 
an optical disk having recording tracks and a method 
of stopping revolution of the optical disk and, more 
particularly, to an improvement in a control system for 
stopping revolution of a spindle motor of an optical 
disk apparatus. An optical disk apparatus for recording/reproducing 
information on/from an optical disk having recording 
tracks by a laser beam emitted from a semiconductor 
laser mounted on an optical head, has been put into 
practical use. In this type of optical disk apparatus, an optical 
head is moved in the radial direction of an optical 
disk, that is, in the direction perpendicular to the 
tracks of the optical disk at high speed by a linear 
motor or a linear actuator thereby to read information 
from the tracks. More specifically, when the optical 
head is moved by the linear motor, a laser beam emitted 
from the optical head is moved, and a beam spot formed 
on the optical disk is moved to a target track. By 
doing so, information is optically read out in sequence 
from the tracks of the rotating optical disk. In the above optical disk apparatus, the optical 
disk is rotated at high speed by a spindle motor. The  
 
following is a conventional control method of stopping 
the spindle motor. The revolution speed of the spindle 
motor is monitored by a frequency generator, and is 
controlled by the pulse (FG pulse) generated from the 
frequency generator in accordance with the monitored 
revolution speed. In order to stop the rotation of the 
optical disk, the spindle motor, which is revolving at a 
high constant revolution speed, is decelerated to a 
predetermined revolution speed 1/3 to 1/4 the constant 
revolution speed, and the current flowing to the spindle 
motor revolved at this predetermined revolution speed, 
is cut off. In the conventional control method of stopping the 
spindle motor, the spindle motor is stably decelerated 
and, when its revolution speed reaches a predetermined 
value, the current for energizing the spindle motor is 
cut off. Since, however, a spindle motor has its own 
torque or inertia, there is a case where the spindle 
motor cannot be stopped when it is decelerated or the 
spindle motor rotates reversely when it is stops. 
For this reason, a mechanical brake is required to 
completely stop the spindle motor. Assuming that an optical disk having a standard 
inertia is rotated by a spindle motor, the spindle motor 
is stably decelerated and
