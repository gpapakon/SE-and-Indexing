<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and process for curing conformal 
coatings on circuit boards being conveyed through a curing 

chamber within a UV oven. Warm air, exhausted from a lamp 
housing containing UV lamps for curing the coatings, is 

directed into a flash zone chamber through which the 
coated circuit boards are conveyed prior to entering the 

UV oven for flashing volatile constituents from the 
coatings and raising the temperature of the circuit 

boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curing protective 
conformal coating materials applied to circuit boards, and 
particularly to a system for flashing off volatile 
constituents of a conformal coating applied to circuit 
boards and raising the temperature of the circuit boards 
prior to curing and then curing the coating in an ultraviolet 
oven. Typically, printed circuit boards are protected 
from moisture proof insulative film, known as a conformal 
coating, such as an acrylic polyurethane, silicone or 
epoxy synthetic resin. Since the coatings are often 
dissolved in volatile solvents, the coated circuit boards 
are usually transported through a flash chamber to flash 
off the volatile solvents prior to curing. Then, the 
coated circuit boards are transported through a curing 
chamber and subjected to ultra-violet ("UV") light to 
initiate the polymerization process for curing the 
conformal material. The UV lights, while necessary for 
curing the conformal coating material, have significant 
disadvantages, primarily relating to the considerable 
amount of heat which they emit. In a high volume production process, such as 
typically used in manufacturing circuit boards, two or  
 
more UV lights are often employed to cure the conformal 
coating material. Because of the considerable heat that 
these lights generate, there are problems relating to the 
rate of temperature rise and the maximum temperature of 
the circuit boards within the curing chamber. Concerning the rate of temperature rise, there is a 
chance that the electronic components mounted on the 
circuit board can be damaged. In particular, when the 
electronic components are surface mounted to the circuit 
boards, significant stresses can be generated in the 
solder joints mounting the components due to the rapid 
rise in temperature. These stresses often lead to 
fracture of the joints and sometimes cause components to 
pop off the board. Moreover, in some circumstances, 
these stresses can damage, e.g. fracture, the circuit 
board itself. Therefore, the maximum rate of temperature 
rise is typically specified to be about 2Â° centigrade per 
second. However, the specific rate can vary depending 
upon the particular application and materials. The other concern is to insure that the electric or 
electronic devices mounted to the circuit boards do not 
exceed a specified maximum temperature during 
manufacture. The temperature which the electronic devices 
attain relates to the temperature within the curing 
chamber and the amount of time that the
