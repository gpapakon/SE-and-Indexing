<ABSTRACT>
Reactive polymeric dyes are provided comprising a chromophoric moiety 
derived from at least one free radically polymerizable dye and an azlactone moiety 

derived from 2-alkenylazlactone such that the free radically polymerizable dye is 
incorporated into the backbone of the polymer. Alternatively, 2-alkenylazlactone 

is polymerized and then derivatized with a nucleophilic dye or dyes, such that the 
chromophoric portion of the dye is pendent to the polymer backbone. Both types 

of reactive polymeric dyes may also contain additional polymerized monomeric 
units. The reactive polymeric dyes of the present invention can be used in a 

photoresist system and in particular in a color proofing construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric dyes, the preparation and use thereof,
and more particularly to reactive polymeric dyes useful in photoresist constructions
and more particularly in aqueous developable color proofing constructions, as well
as other color imaging constructions.In the graphics arts, it is often desirable to produce a four or more color
proof from image data to assist a printer in correcting a set of color prints prior to
using the image data to produce color plates and also to reproduce the color quality
that will be obtained during the printing process. The proof must be a consistent
duplication of the half tone image from a printing process, and should neither gain
nor lose color in comparison to the printed image. Visual examination of a color
proof should show the following characteristics:
1. defects on the negatives,2. best color rendition to be expected from press printing of the
material,3. correct gradation of all colors and whether grays are neutral, and4. need, if any, for subduing one of the colors and/or giving directions
for altering the film negatives before making the printing plates.
Color proofing for multi-colored printing without the use of pre-press color proofs
are made by using a printing press or a proof press taking all the steps necessary for
actual multicolor printing. Such a conventional method of color proofing is costly
and time consuming.Photographic processes are known that use photopolymers. There are
various types of photographic color proofing methods, for example, the surprint
type (laminated single sheet) and the overlay type.Presently, aqueous developable color proofing constructions utilize
resin-dispersed pigments. Such resins have to provide a good pigment dispersion
but must also be compatible with photooligomers or photopolymers used in the
color proofing construction. Unfortunately, dispersed pigments are prone to
migration into adjacent layers of the proofing construction, thus contributing to
colorant bleeding.In the overlay type of color proofing method, an independent transparent
plastic support is used for producing a print of each color separation film by 
applying a photosensitive layer of the corresponding color. A plurality of such
supports carrying prints of corresponding colors are then superimposed upon each
other on a white sheet to produce a color proof. The primary advantage of overlay
type of color proofing is that it is quick and can serve as an overlay proof by
combining at least three or four colors in register.In the
