<ABSTRACT>
A DNA transporter system capable of non-covalently binding to DNA and facilitating the insertion of the DNA into a cell. The DNA transporter system includes a binding complex which non-covalently binds the DNA. The binding complex includes a molecule that is capable of non-covalently binding to the DNA and being covalently linked to a surface ligand and to a nuclear ligand. The surface ligand is capable of binding to a cell surface receptor and the nuclear ligand is capable of recognizing and transporting the transporter system through the nuclear membrane. A plurality of these binding complexes are attached to the DNA to facilitate the transport of the DNA into the cell. Additionally, a third binding complex which includes a virus can also be non-covalently linked to the DNA. The virus facilitates the movement of the DNA through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. Also described are a variety of structures which can be used as part of the transporter system as well as methods of using the transporter system to introduce DNA into cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A DNA TRANSPORTER SYSTEM AND METHOD OF USEThe invention was partially supported by a grant from the United States government under HL-23741 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to transporter systems for inserting DNA into the cell nucleus. It more particularly relates to targeting DNA into the nucleus of specific cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, it relates to methods of using lytic peptides to release DNA into the cellular interior. Further, it relates to the methods of using a transporter system to insert DNA into cells.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Generally it has been recognized that it is desirable to introduce genes into specific types of cells as therapy for human disease. A targeted gene delivery system for nonviral forms of DNA and RNA requires 4 components: (a) a DNA or RNA molecule with a known primary sequence that contains the genetic information of interest, (b) a moiety that recognizes and bind to a cell surface receptor or antigen, (c) a DNA binding moiety and (d) a lytic moiety that enables the transport of the entire complex from the cell surface directly into the cytoplasm. Current gene delivery systems are asialoorsomucoid or transferrin, covalently linked to either a polymer of the amino acid lysine or ethidium homodimer and then complexed with DNA. The polylysine or the ethidium moiety provides a positively charged template for noncovalent binding of the negatively charged nucleic acid expression vector. After cellular uptake of these complexes, detectable, but not quantitatively significant, amounts of the reporter gene have been found.The principal limitation of this approach is the inability to prepare reproducible proteinaceous complexes in a consistent manner for gene delivery. The actual site of ligation is unknown. The covalent coupling of polylysine or the dye with proteins is nonspecific and gives a random mixture of conjugates. Because the conformation of positively charged surfaces is formed by chance, binding of DNA to the charged template is also variable. The high molecular weight and 

variable stoichiometry of the components of the complex has made it difficult to prepare the complexes either consistently well or in sufficient quantity for in vivo delivery. The mixture of compounds precludes a molecular definition of the biologically active reagent and present formulations are inadequate for this reason.The present invention is an
