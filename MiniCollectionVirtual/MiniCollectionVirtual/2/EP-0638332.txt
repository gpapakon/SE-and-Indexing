<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for fire protection of highly sensitive devices, in particular electrical and/or electronic devices, by means of a gaseous arc-extinguishing medium which is maintained in a highly compressed state and introduced in the event of fire into the device to be protected. Previous similar methods and apparatuses have required modifications to the system to be protected. It is provided according to the invention to feed the gaseous arc-extinguishing medium from outside through one or more openings present in the housing of the electrical/electronic device.

Method of protecting highly sensitive equipment,
more especially electronic equipment, from fire by means of

a gaseous extinguishing agent, which is supplied in a
highly compressed state and, in the event of a fire, is

introduced into the equipment to be protected,
characterised in that gaseous extinguishing agent is

introduced from externally through one or more air inlet
and air outlet apertures of the venting arrangement, such

apertures being provided in the housing of the
electrical/electronic equipment.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the feeding is effected via the air outlet aperture of the

electronic equipment, more especially when the venting
arrangement of the electronic equipment is switched-off.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the fire is detected by means of an automatic fire

detecting device disposed at the air outlet aperture, and
the extinguishing agent then starts to be supplied.
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that,
after the detection of a fire, the automatic fire detecting

device is flooded with extinguishing agent, whereby
extinguishing agent flows from suction apertures of the

automatic fire detecting device into the air outlet
aperture of the electrical equipment.
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that
a device for the feeding of extinguishing agent is

displaceably disposed on the housing of the electrical
appliances and is moved in alignment over the housing

opening only in the event of a fire being detected, so that
discharge apertures, disposed in the feeding device, lie in

alignment at the housing opening. 
Apparatus for protecting highly sensitive
equipment, more especially electronic equipment, from fire,

said apparatus having supply lines, feeding devices and
discharge apertures for extinguishing agents, characterised

in that the discharge apertures (9), at least in the event
of a fire, are disposed in alignment relative to the air

inlet or air outlet aperture provided in the housing (1) of
the electrical equipment.
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in
that the discharge apertures (9) are disposed in alignment

with the air outlet apertures (2) of the electrical
equipment.
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in
that the feeding device (8), provided with the discharge

apertures (9) for gaseous extinguishing agent, is
displaceably disposed.
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in
that the feeding device (8), provided with the discharge

apertures (9) for gaseous extinguishing agent, is disposed
so as to be pivotable over the air outlet aperture (2) in

the housing (1) of the electronic equipment.
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, characterised
in that an automatic fire detecting device (20), provided

with suction apertures, is disposed at the air outlet
aperture (2), said suction apertures being in alignment

with the air outlet aperture (2) in the housing (1) of the
electrical appliances, and the automatic fire detecting

device (20) is adapted to be floodable with gaseous
extinguishing agent in the event of a fire.
