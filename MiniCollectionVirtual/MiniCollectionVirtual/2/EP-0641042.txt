<ABSTRACT>
A connector (10,30) of an electrical connector assembly includes a 
housing defining a pair of parallel cavities (12a,32a) extending 

therethrough, and a partition wall (13,33) partitioning the cavities from 
one another. A leakage-prevention plate (14,34) having a finlike 

configuration is interposed between the open ends of the two 
cavities. Thus, the path of least resistance between terminal 

fixtures (20,40) within the respective cavities extends over both 
surfaces of the leakage-prevention plate (14,34). For this reason, the 

value of leakage current between the fixtures retained by the 
same connector will be extremely small, and the electrical 

corrosion of the terminal fixtures will be reliably suppressed. 
Furthermore, the leakage-prevention plate (14,34) may possess a high 

degree of water repellency by being formed of an oil-impregnated 
resin in which particles of lubricating oil are dispersed within 

synthetic resin and/or by having the surfaces machined to a 
mirror finish. This prevents a continuous band of water from 

developing between the two terminal fixtures. The above 
structure may be applied to a male and/or a female connector (10,30) of 

the connector assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector which, when 
performing electrical wiring, is used to establish a male-female 
union at ends of the electrical wires and, more particularly, to 
such a connector provided with a water-resistant structure 
wherein current will not leak between respective terminal 
fixtures. In a connector assembly including male and female connectors 
each provided with a plurality of cavities, when a potential 
difference occurs between terminal fixtures within adjacent 
cavities while the connector is wet, current flows (referred to 
as "leakage current") between the two terminal fixtures. When 
leakage current flows, the terminal fixtures may corrode (i.e., 
electrical corrosion), and so various water-resistant structures 
have been considered in the prior art in order to prevent this 
problem. These structures include a completely water-resistant 
structure and a simplified water-resistant structure. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a connector implementing a 
completely water-resistant structure. A rubber plug 2 and insulated electrical wire 3 are crimped 
by the rear end of a male terminal fixture 1. The male terminal 
fixture 1 is inserted into a cavity 6 formed in a housing 5 of a 
male connector 4. The housing 5 is formed with a plurality of 
parallel cavities 6, and respective open ends of the cavities are 
sealed by the rubber plug.  
 Further, a hood 8, which receives a mating connector 7, is 
formed at the other end of the housing 5. An annular seal 9 is 
disposed in a space within the hood 8. When the mating connector 
7 is housed within the hood 8, the annular seal 9 is interposed 
between the inner peripheral surface of the hood 8 and the outer 
peripheral surface of the mating connector 7 to provide 
resistance to water. Although complete water resistance can be expected if a 
rubber plug 2 and seal 9 are used in this manner, the rubber plug 
2 and seal 9 contribute to a comparatively high cost of the 
assembly, and the operation of passing the insulated electrical 
wire 3 through the rubber plug 2 is troublesome. Because of 
this, a simpler water-resistant structure is employed, for 
example, in the upper areas of an engine compartment of an 
automobile and similar locations where the chance of water 
penetration is small. Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application No. 56-57486 
discloses such a known simplified water-resistant structure. An end of a connector housing wherein a terminal fixture is 
inserted in a cavity is formed with a groove provided between
