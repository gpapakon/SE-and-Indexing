<ABSTRACT>
Control of temperature of air efflux from an air outlet (13) is by control of the oscillation of a fluidic oscillator. Directionality of efflux is by control of nibs (14L, 14R) at the outlet (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an air outlet structure
and system, in which air temperature is controlled by mixing or
pulsating control of the air flow and also to control the fan
angle and directionality of the air flow vectors.Fluidic oscillators for causing a sweeping or oscillatory
movement of an air jet are well known in the art as is
exemplified by the following prior US-patents: 5,099,753, 4,709,622,
4,694,992, 4,672,886 and 3,832,939, and there are many other
examples.In Stouffer patents 4,437,392 and 4 517 881 and Morris et al. patent
4,941,398, all owned by the assignee hereof, a flexible vane is
oscillated by a moving air stream to impose a sweeping or fan-shape
to the output air stream.An object of the present invention is to provide a
temperature controller using a fluidic element. A further object
of the invention is to provide a low cost temperature controller
for issuing air (heated or cooled) into a living space such as a
room or into the passenger compartment of a vehicle, such as a
passenger car. A further object of the invention is to provide a
controllable fluidic element. Still a further object of the
invention is to provide a low cost remote control arrangement for
controlling the oscillation or non-oscillation of a fluidic
element.According to the invention, an island
oscillator element of the type disclosed in Stouffer patent
4,151,955 (incorporated herein by reference) is rendered non-oscillatory
by translation of the island, or by shifting of a
portion of the outlet structure relative to the island. In a
further preferred embodiment, the oscillation or non-oscillation
of an island oscillator is remotely controlled by a valve feeding
pressurized air from upstream of the island to a position or
point which precludes the formation of shed or Karman vortices 
and oscillatory action via an externally operable valve
elements, respectively.The invention is directed to a method for
controlling the temperature of air efflux from a heated
or cooled air outlet to ambient air. According to this
invention, a controllable fluidic island oscillator is
provided in the air outlet. The fluidic island
oscillator includes nibs at the sides of the outlet to
provide confinement to the downstream section of the
island and to support oscillation, and fluidically
controlling the oscillatory and non-oscillatory
conditions of the island oscillator to moderate the
mixing of the air flow through the outlet with ambient
air and thus modulate the air efflux.Furthermore, the invention is directed to
