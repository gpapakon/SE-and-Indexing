<ABSTRACT>
A photographic element including a support and at 
least two green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers 

of different sensitivity, each emulsion layer comprising 
a two-equivalent pyrazoloazole magenta dye-forming 

coupler having a structure according to formula I of the 
disclosure. The activity of the dye-forming coupler 

present in the layer of lower sensitivity is less than 
the activity of the dye-forming coupler present in the 

layer of higher sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silver halide photographic 
materials having improved granularity and color 
saturation. In particular, the invention relates to a 
photographic element containing at least two separate 
layers of different sensitivity to green light, including 
a more active pyrazoloazole magenta coupler in the more 
sensitive layer and a less active pyrazoloazole magenta 
coupler in the less sensitive layer or layers. There is a continuing need in the photographic art 
to improve and optimize the attributes of the film, such 
as the image structure of the film. In particular, there 
is a desire to reduce the amount of "noise," or 
nonuniformity, in the developed film. The visual 
sensation produced by such nonuniformity is termed 
"graininess," while the objective measure of the 
nonuniformity is termed "granularity." See T.H. James, 
"The Theory of the Photographic Process," (4th ed. 1977), 
pp. 618-33). Preferably, reduction in the granularity of 
the developed film should be achieved without adversely 
affecting other photographic parameters, such as 
sensitivity to light (speed), latitude, sharpness, 
interimage effects, curve shape, D-max, and density. Various approaches to optimizing granularity are 
known in the art. Such approaches include: coating high 
concentrations of silver; reducing the size of grains in 
the film; and decreasing the full development of grains 
by the use of development inhibitors. The foregoing 
methods are not always desirable, however, since they 
require the coating of additional silver in order to 
obtain the desired curve shape and density. The use of  
 
more silver is additionally disadvantageous since it 
often results in increased light absorption, which 
degrades the performance of the underlying layers. 
Moreover, use of excess silver can result in 
difficulties in the removal (bleaching) of the silver 
from the developed film. Smearing couplers have also been used to reduce 
granularity. This method, however, often undesirably 
reduces the film sharpness. Another approach, use of couplers that generate low 
extinction dyes, involves the use of more silver, with 
the accompanying disadvantages discussed above. Another method, involving coating reduced amounts 
of couplers in the layers of the photographic element in 
order to "starve" the coupler, generally has a negative 
impact on D-max, curve shape, color saturation, and 
silver efficiency. All of the known methods of reducing granularity 
typically have an adverse effect on other film 
properties.
