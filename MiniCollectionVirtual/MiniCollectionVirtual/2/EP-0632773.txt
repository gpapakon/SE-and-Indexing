<ABSTRACT>
Measures are disclosed for modifying the boundary layer flow over fluid dynamic surfaces using patterns of riblets having heights which are varied in the direction of the stream to compensate for the self limiting effect of the riblets in the action on the fluid, for the displacement of boundary layer turbulence due to progressive increase of the riblet heights, for effects dependent upon Reynolds Number and for variation of skin friction in the flow direction. In another aspect, riblet patterns are provided which modify the boundary layer flow through laminar, transitional and turbulent boundary layer regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the modification of 
boundary layer flows over fluid dynamic surfaces, which 
may be aerodynamic or hydrodynamic surfaces. It is 
particularly concerned with the use of small-geometry 
surface configurations comprising rib-like elements to 
modify heat, mass or momentum transport by controlling 
interaction of a boundary layer of the flow with the 
surface. There have been many investigations in recent 
years of the effects that small-geometry surface 
configurations can have on turbulent boundary layers. 
Particular attention has been paid to the provision of 
so-called riblet surfaces in which an array of small 
longitudinal rib-like elements known as riblets extend 
over the turbulent boundary layer region of a wall surface 
in the direction of fluid flow over the surface, to reduce 
momentum transport or drag. This effect is seen to be the 
result of reducing the turbulent bursting rate, ie. the 
rate of break up of the low speed longitudinal vortices 
that characteristically form a turbulent boundary layer 
close to the wall. The prior art frequently refers to "streaks" 
rather than longitudinal vortices, although strictly 
speaking a streak is merely the visible manifestation of 
vortices in smoke tunnel experiments, and the present 
specification will follow this practice. The results reported show that although the 
effect of riblets may be beneficial it is rather small for 
practical purposes and that has led to the search for 
alternative geometries and combinations of techniques 
offering larger benefits. A number of particular riblet configurations are 
disclosed in US 4930729 with the aim of offering an 
improved performance by exploiting different effects. In 
one such configuration, there are spaced larger height  
 
riblets between each successive pair of which are a 
plurality of smaller height projections. The smaller 
height riblets are sized in height and in projection-to-projection 
spacing to inhibit turbulent eddy motions in 
the boundary layer from penetrating deep between adjacent 
riblets, while the larger height riblets are sized in 
height and in projection-to-projection spacing to 
constrain spanwise distribution of streaks in the boundary 
layer. Another configuration described in US 4930729 
comprises riblets disposed in a repeated spanwise pattern 
in which the adjacent riblets in each pattern repeat 
project to different heights. In its simplest form, in 
which there are alternating higher and lower riblets, the 
lower riblets function to
