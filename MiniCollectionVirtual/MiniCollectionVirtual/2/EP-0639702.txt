<ABSTRACT>
A nonwoven, high temperature resistant, ceramic fiber 
mounting mat (32) has an edge protectant (34) which 

reduces erosion of a lateral edge (33) when exposed to hot, 
impinging gases and which is also useful as a high temperature sealing 

material. The edge protectant or high temperature sealing material 
comprises binder material in the range from about 5 to about 85 percent 

by weight and dispersed therein glass particles in the range from about 
95 to about 15 percent by weight, based on the total weight of said 

binder material and said glass particles, wherein said glass particles 
are made of a glass having a softening point of at least about 350°C, 

and wherein the combined weight of said binder material and said glass 
particles is at least 20 percent by weight of the total weight of
 said 
edge protectant or high temperature sealing material. 

The mounting mat is useful in the 
construction of catalytic converters (10), diesel 

particulate traps or filters, insulated end-cones of 
catalytic converters, and insulated double-walled 

exhaust pipes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high temperature mounting 
mats with an edge protectant material. In another 
aspect, this invention relates to a high temperature 
sealant for high temperature mounting mats. The mounting 
mats are useful in the construction of catalytic 
converters, diesel particulate traps or filters, 
insulated end-cones of catalytic converters, and 
insulated double-walled exhaust pipes. Nonwoven, ceramic (i.e., glass, crystalline ceramic, 
or glass-ceramic) fiber mounting mats are used to hold 
monoliths (e.g., catalytic converter elements or diesel 
particulate filters) in place while being subjected to 
exposure to gases at moderate pressure pulsations and 
temperatures (typically less than about 750°C). Under 
these severe conditions, over a period of time, the mat 
material if left unprotected can be eroded. This problem 
is even more pronounced in high performance automobiles 
and heavy duty trucks, wherein the mounting mat is 
typically subjected to higher temperatures and more 
severe pressure pulsations. Solutions to the problem 
known in the art include the use of a knitted wire mesh 
seal or braided wire rope seal. Further, the inherently porous nature of nonwoven, 
ceramic fiber mounting mats, for example, when used as a 
mounting mat in a catalytic converter utilizing a 
monolithic catalytic converter element allows at least a 
portion of exhaust gases to bypass the catalytic 
converter element and flow through the mounting mat. 
Solutions to the problem include the use of a braided 
wire rope seal.  The present invention provides a mounting mat 
comprising: 
(a) a nonwoven, high temperature resistant, 
ceramic fiber mounting mat having a 
lateral edge; and  (b) a sufficient amount of a high temperature 
sealing material covering the lateral edge 
to reduce penetration, when exposed to 
hot, impinging gases (i.e., above about 
300°C, preferably above about 350°C, more 
preferably above about 500°C, and even 
more preferably above about 750°C), of the 
gases through the lateral edge, the high 
temperature sealing material comprising 
binder material in the range from about 5 
to about 85 percent by weight and 
dispersed (uniformly or nonuniformly) 
therein glass particles in the range from 
about 95 to about 15 percent by weight, 
based on the total weight of the binder 
material and the glass particles, wherein 
the glass particles are made of a glass 
having a softening point of at least about 
350°C, and wherein the combined weight of 
the binder material and the glass
