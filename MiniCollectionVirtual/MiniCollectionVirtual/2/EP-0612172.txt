<ABSTRACT>
This satellite centre includes subscriber access circuits (1) produced in electronics technology, which particularly carry out the functions of: translation of the cell headers; addition of a routing label; and policing throughput monitoring. It further includes concentrators (2) including statistical time-division multiplexing devices (34.1, ..., 34.16) and periodic time-division demultiplexing devices (47.1, ..., 47.16) which are produced in electronics technology; and a spectral multiplexing and data rate-changing device (38), a periodic time-division multiplexing device without spectral multiplexing (40), a data rate changing and spectral demultiplexing device (43), and a periodic time-division demultiplexing and spectral multiplexing device (41), which are produced in optical technology. This structure makes it possible to optimise the use of the optical technology and of the electronics technology in order to obtain minimum production costs. Application to asynchronous transfer mode telecommunications networks.

to an asynchronous transfer mode telecommunication network, said subscriber

lines conveying data in the form of cells including a header containing routing
information, said access unit including:


an asynchronous transfer mode switching network (5);
subscriber line interface circuits (1, 6) connected to respective subscriber lines;
at least one concentrator (2, 7) connecting the switching network (5) to the

characterized in that the subscriber line interface circuits (1, 6) include;

means (21) for converting optical signals supplied by the subscriber lines into
electrical signals;
electronic means (23) for discriminating between empty cells, signalling cells
and maintenance cells in the stream of cells from the subscriber lines;
electronic means (24) for translating routing information contained in the
headers of the cells from the subscriber lines and writing the translated

information into said headers;
electronic means (25) for adding a routing label to the cells from the subscriber
lines; and
electronic means (26) for monitoring the bit rate of the cells from the subscriber
lines;
