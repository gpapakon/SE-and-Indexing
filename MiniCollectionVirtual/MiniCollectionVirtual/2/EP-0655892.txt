<ABSTRACT>
A brush for applying make-up, particularly mascara, including a shaft provided at one end with a core (6) formed by two metal wires (7, 8) twisted together and having bristles (9) squeezed therebetween such that they extend transversely to the core axis. At least some of the brush bristles (9) have an L-shaped cross-section so that the portion of each bristle (9) which is squeezed between said twisted core wires is flattened either outwards when the arms of the L are pushed apart, or inwards when they are pressed together. In either case, the stiffness of the bristle is reduced and the spacing between the bristle and the wire helix is advantageously increased, whereby a random distribution of bristle cross-sections is achieved.

Brush for applying a make-up product,
particularly a mascara, comprising a wand (5) equipped at

one end with a core (6) formed by two branches (7, 8)
made from metal wire which are twisted into turns between

which bristles (9) extending transversely with respect to
the core are trapped and capable of forming by spiral

effect a helical ply when all the bristles behave
identically, characterized in that at least a fraction of

the bristles (9) of the brush has a transverse section
(S) in the shape of an L, which is known per se, so that

the zone of a bristle (9) wedged between the turns of the
metal core undergoes a flattening either through the

effect of unfolding when the angle (A) between the
branches (10, 11) of the L opens or through the effect of

folding when the angle (A) between the branches of the L
closes, this flattening reducing to a greater or lesser

extent the rigidity of the bristle on the one hand and,
on the other hand, preferentially increasing the spacing

of the bristle with respect to the helical ply which is
capable of being formed by spiral effect, thus creating

a disorganized arrangement of the section of the bristles
and reducing the spiral effect at the ends of the

bristles.
Brush according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the branches (10, 11) of the L have the same length (
h
).
Brush according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the branches of the L together form

an angle of approximately 90Â°.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the span (D) of the transverse

section in the shape of an L of a bristle (9), in the
non-deformed state, is between 10 one hundredths and 50

one hundredths of a millimetre.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the thickness (
e
) of each branch of the
section of a bristle is approximately 0.04 mm.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the ends (15) of at least a portion of 

the bristles are shredded.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the bristles (9) with a transverse

section in the shape of the L are mixed with bristles
having a substantially flat transverse section.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the bristles having a transverse section

in the shape of an L are mixed with harder bristles, the
whole assembly being ground in order to obtain bristles

having a transverse section in the shape of an L in which
the ends are located beyond those of the hard bristles

made shorter by grinding.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that the ends of the bristles (9) having a

transverse section in the shape of an L have been exposed
to a source of heat (16) and have a swollen part (17).
Brush according to Claim 9, characterized in that
the bristles (9) having a transverse section in the shape

of an L are mixed with bristles of smaller section, the
whole assembly then being exposed to the source of heat

(16), exposure to the heat giving rise to a shortening of
the bristles of small section which is greater than that

of the bristles (9) having a section in the shape of an
L, in which the ends project beyond those of the bristles

of smaller section.
Brush according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized
in that the number of bristles per turn is small,

of the order of 7 to 40 bristles per turn.
