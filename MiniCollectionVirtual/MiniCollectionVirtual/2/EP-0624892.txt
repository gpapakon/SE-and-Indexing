<ABSTRACT>
A remote circuit breaker (10) includes an electromagnet (14) with a pivoting blade (16), a mechanism (16) with a rocker arm (68), and a device with main (18) and auxiliary (20) contacts. The movable auxiliary contact (20) forms part of a time-delayed auto-cutout system (26) intended not to cut off the excitation of the electromagnet (14) prematurely. The auto-cutout system (26) includes elastic contact strips (82, 84) interacting in an opposite way to the rocker arm (68) with the movable auxiliary contact (20).

<CLAIMS>
A remote-controlled switch comprising : 

an actuating means (12) equipped with an electromagnet (14) with a pivoting blade 
(60), 
a mechanism (16) having a rocker (68) mounted with rocking between two stable 
end positions, 
a mechanical control part (66) securedly united to the blade (60) and cooperating 
with the rocker (68) to move the latter positively from one stable position to the other 

stable position at each operating cycle of the blade (60), 
at least one movable main contact (18) of a power circuit (22) actuated by the rocker 
(68), 
a movable auxiliary contact (20) of a time-delayed self-breaking system (26) 
electrically inserted in the power supply circuit of the electromagnet (14) in such a way 

as to open after the movable main contact (18), in order not to interrupt the excitation 
of the electromagnet (14) prematurely, the actuation of the movable auxiliary contact 

(20) being derived from the rocking movement of the rocker (68), 
 
characterized in that
 
the self-breaking system (26) comprises flexible conducting means cooperating with 

the movable auxiliary contact (20) to achieve the time delay on opening. 
The remote-controlled switch according to claim 1, characterized in that the flexible 
conducting means are formed by at least one flexible contact strip (82, 84, 82a, 84a) 

whose deflection determines said time delay. 
The remote-controlled switch according to claim 2, characterized in that the contact 
strip (82, 84) forms part of a semi-stationary contact (38, 40) cooperating with the rigid 

end of the movable auxiliary contact (20).  
 
The remote-controlled switch according to claim 2, characterized in that the flexible 
contact strip (82a, 84a) is securedly united to the movable auxiliary contact (20) and 

cooperates with a stationary contact (38a, 40a) of the self-breaking system (26). 
The remote-controlled switch according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the movable auxiliary contact (20) is a bistable rocking contact forming part of a 

changeover circuit (28) electrically connected to an external switching device (34). 
The remote-controlled switch according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
switching device (34) comprises a pair of pulse-controlled ON and OFF push-buttons 

to achieve a centralized control function. 
The remote-controlled switch according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
switching device (34) is formed by a changeover contact with a sustained order from 

a selector switch, a time switch or a thermostat. 
The remote-controlled switch according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the self-breaking system (26) is housed in a first case (36) with the electromagnet 

(14) and the mechanism (16), the movable auxiliary contact (20) and the movable 
main contact (18) being arranged side by side and driven simultaneously by the 

rocker (68). 
The remote-controlled switch according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the self-breaking system (26) is housed with an auxiliary rocker in a second case 

able to be adjoined to the first main case (36), the main rocker (68) and the auxiliary 
rocker being coupled by means of a mechanical link (80) with engagement.
