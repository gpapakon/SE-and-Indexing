<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aerating nozzle (1) for aerating organic-substance-containing liquids. In order to keep the foam formation, in the case of organic substances which are to be aerated, within limits in a controlled manner, the invention provides that the angles of inclination of the side walls which delimit the liquid channel (2) are no greater than 30@ with respect to the longitudinal axis (13), running in the direction of flow (38), of the aerating nozzle (1) at any point, the distributor bushing, whose liquid channel (2) is designed in a rectilinear manner, being arranged such that it can be exchanged for distributor bushings (9) which differ in terms of number and/or magnitude of the gas-inlet openings.
