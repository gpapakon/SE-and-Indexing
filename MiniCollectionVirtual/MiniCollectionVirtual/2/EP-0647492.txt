<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method for the production of nestable parts, at least one part being produced by powder diecasting. To compensate for the shrinkage of the part produced by powder diecasting and, if required, to provide additional play, a separating layer (5) of plastic is applied between the nestable parts. After the casting operation, the separating layer and the binder are eliminated during the binder-elimination and sintering process. The method can also be used in metal-powder extrusion for the production of two-layer metal profiles.

A method for the manufacture of interlocking metal and also
ceramic parts, in which at least one part is manufactured by powder

injection moulding, characterized in that a separation layer (5) of
plastics material is applied to a part (2) by injection moulding, the

additional part (11) is subsequently injected onto the separation
layer (5) by powder injection moulding, the thickness of the

separation layer corresponding at least to the contraction of the
additional part (11), and after the injection operation the separation

layer and the binder are eliminated during the binder-removing and
sintering process.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that both parts (2,
11) are manufactured by powder injection moulding, the separation

layer (5) being injected on after injection moulding of the first part
(2), and both interlocking parts (2, 11) are jointly subjected to binder

removal and sintering.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, to
manufacture the interlocking parts (2, 11) and apply the separation

layer (5), two-component or three-component injection moulding
machines with corresponding injection moulding tools are used.
A method for the manufacture of double-layer shaped metal parts,
in which at least one of the two metal layers is manufactured by a

powdered metal extrusion method, characterized in that a
separation layer (18) of plastics material is applied by extrusion to

the inner shaped part (13) and the outer metal layer (19) of the
shaped part is applied to the separation layer (18) in a powdered

metal extrusion process, the thickness of the separation layer (18) 
corresponding at least to the contraction of the outer metal layer

(19), and in that after the extrusion process the separation layer
(18) and the binder are eliminated in a continuous binder-removing

and sintering process.
A method according to claim 4, characterized in that the inner
shaped part (13) is manufactured by the powdered metal extrusion

process and the separation layer (18) and also the outer metal
layer (19) are applied continuously in CO-extrusion using two

additional injection cylinders (17, 21).
