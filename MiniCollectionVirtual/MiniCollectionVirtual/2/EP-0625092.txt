<DESCRIPTION>
 CONSOLIDATION AND MOLDING OF POLYBENZAZOLE-CONTAINING MATERIALSThe present invention relates to the art of consolidation/molding of polybenzazole (PBZ) polymers and molecular composite materials containing these polymers.PBZ polymers, i.e., polybenzoxazole, polybenzothiazole and polybenzimidazole, and their synthesis are described in great detail in the following patents: Wolfe et al., Liquid Crystalline Polymer Compositions, Process and Products. U.S. Patent 4,703,103 (October 27, 1987); Wolfe et al.. Liquid Crystalline Polymer Compositions, Process and Products, U.S. Patent 4,533,692 (August 6, 1985); Wolfe et al., Liquid Crystalline Poly(2,6-Benzothiazole) Com¬ positions, Process and Products, U.S. Patent 4,533,724 (August 6, 1985); Wolfe, Liquid Crystal¬ line Polymer Compositions, Process and Products, U.S. Patent 4,533,693 (August 6, 1985); Evers, Thermoxidatively Stable'Articulated p-Benzobisoxazole and p-Benzobisthiazole Polymers, U.S. Patent 4,359,567 (November 16, 1982); Tsai et al.. Method for Making Heterocvclic Block Copolymer, U.S. Patent 4,578,432 (March 25, 1986) and 1 1 Ency. Poly. Sci. & Eng., Polybenzothiazoles and Polybenzoxazoles, 601 (J. Wiley & Sons 1988).Shaped articles made from consolidated polybenzazole polymers and molecular composite materials containing the same are known to be useful in aircraft, electronic and other commercial applications where heat, chemical and radiation resistance are desired in conjunction with good mechanical and electrical properties.Typically, materials which have a melting or softening point are suitable for consolidation. Those materials which show no transitions (melting or softening) below their' decomposition temperatures, such as rigid and semi-rigid polybenzazoles, have been considered unsuitable for consolidation.Many mixtures and variations of PBZ have been made attempting to improve its processing such as the following:(a) block copolymers of PBZ with thermoplastic polymers, such as those described in U.S. Patent 5,030,706, EPO Publication No. 0 388803 (9/26/90), copending U.S. Application 

Serial No. 547,650, filed July 2, 1990 and U.S. Application Serial No. 562,781 , filed August 6,1990;(b) block copolymers of rigid PBZ with semi-rigid PBZ, such as those described inU.S. Patent 4,578,432 (Tsai); (c) moiecular composites of PBZ with thermoplastic copolymers and non-rigid PBZ polymers, described in 1 1 E ncy. Poly. Sc/'. at pages 631 -632 "The Materials Science & Engineering of Rigid Rod Polymers" at pages 507-569; and(d) semi-rigid

Claims :
1. A process for consolidating/molding a material made of (a) block copolymers of rigid or semi-rigid PBZ with thermoplastic polymers, (b) block copolymers of rigid PBZ with semi-rigid PBZ, (c) molecular composites of rigid or semi-rigid PBZ with thermoplastic polymers, (d) molecular composites of rigid or semi-rigid PBZ with non-rigid PBZ polymers or (d) semi-rigid PBZ polymers, which process comprises:

(2) removing substantially all surface water remaining on the material, leaving the material with sufficient water to plasticize the material,
(3) subjecting the material to a first pressure P which is sufficient to provide a substantially void-
-free consolidated material upon molding, and

2
 to the wet coagulated material in amounts sufficient to fuse the films or film layers, filaments or fibers, powders or granules into a single entity.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein the rigid or semi-rigid polybenzazole block consists of mer units that are represented by any one of the Formulae: 

3. The process of Claim 1 wherein the thermoplastic polymer is a thermoplastic polybenzazole polymer that contains mer units represented by any one of the Formulae:
18
wherein:
X is a bond or a first divalent linking moiety; each Ar, Ar
1
 and AJ is an aromatic group;
L is a non-linear group that is stable under conditions at which the polymer is synthesized, fabricated and used;
R
1
 is an aliphatic group that contains at least about 3 carbon atoms; and each Z is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom. 4. The process of Claim 1 wherein the thermoplastic polymer is a polyamide, a polyimide, a polyquinoxaline, a polyquinoline, a poly(aromatic ether ketone) and/or a poly(aromatic ether sulfone), or a copoiymer of those polymers with each other and/or polybenzazole. 


 5. A process for consolidating/molding a material made of (a) block copolymers of PBZ with thermoplastic polymers, (b) block copolymers of rigid PBZ with semi-rigid PBZ, (c) molecular composites of PBZ with thermoplastic copolymers, (d) molecular composites of PBZ with non-rigid PBZ polymers or (d) semi-rigid PBZ polymers, which process comprises: (1) providing the material in its substantially acid-free, wet coagulated state, and in the form of a plurality of films or film layers, filaments or fibers, powders, or granules,
(2) removing substantially all surface water remaining on the material, leaving the material with sufficient water to plasticize the material,
(3) placing the material in a bag assembly and applying a fluid pressure of about 1 atmosphere to the material, and
(4) placing the bag assembly containing the material in a hydraulic press and applying temperature and pressure thereto under the following schedule:
(a) apply an increasing temperature from ambient to about 100°C at a pressure of 1 atmosphere (0.1 MPa or 14.7 psi) over a period of 10 minutes, (b) apply an increasing pressure from about 0.1 MPa to about 35 MPa at 100°C
(c) apply an increasing temperature from 100°C to 400°C at 35 MPa over a period of 10 minutes, and
(d) cool to less than about 100°C.
6. A consolidated/molded article made by the process of Claim 1. 7. A consolidated/molded article made by the process of Claim 5.
