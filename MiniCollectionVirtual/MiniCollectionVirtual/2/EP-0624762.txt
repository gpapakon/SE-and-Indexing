<ABSTRACT>
An absorber (10) of an absorption refrigerating apparatus 
is constituted by two joined plates (52 and 54, respectively), 

which between themselves form a plurality of horizontal ducts 
(60) located above each other for the refrigerant. The bottom 

of the ducts shows small openings (64), through which the 
absorption liquid leaks down into the roof of ducts located 

below and moves downwards along their roofs and walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an absorber for an absorption 
refrigerating apparatus, which absorber shows an inlet for a 
liquid, flowing downwards through the absorber and absorbing a 
refrigerant, which in gaseous form flows through the absorber, 
the absorber being constituted by two joined plates, which 
between themselves form a plurality of substantially horizontal 
ducts, arranged above each other, for the refrigerant Such an absorber is known through US-A-3 782 134. By it 
being constituted by two joined plates it becomes easy to 
produce and takes small place. The object of the invention is to bring about an absorber 
of the kind introductorily set forth, where the absorption of 
refrigerant in the liquid is improved. This object is obtained through the absorber according to 
the invention thereby that the plates on the inside of the 
absorber are treated in a way which promotes that the inside is 
wetted by the liquid and that the bottom of the ducts show 
small openings, through which the liquid leaks down into the 
roof of a duct located below and moves downwards along its roof 
and walls. By this the liquid will all the time move along the whole 
inner surface of the absorber, whereby the refrigerant during 
its passage through the absorber will permanently be surrounded 
by flowing, absorbing liquid.  
 An embodiment of an absorber according to the invention is 
described below in connection with the enclosed drawing, in 
which Fig. 1 shows the absorber as part of an absorption 
refrigerating apparatus, Fig. 2 shows a sectional view 
according to the marking II-II in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 shows a 
pattern of capillary grooves on the inside of the absorber, 
Fig. 4 shows an enlarged view of the pattern in fig. 3, and 
Fig. 5 shows a sectional view according to the marking V-V in 
Fig. 4. Fig. 1 shows an absorption refrigerating apparatus for e.g. 
a refrigerator cabinet, e.g. according to Fig. 1 of US-A-5 
001 904, which apparatus shows an absorber 10 containing an 
absorption liquid, e.g. water, up to a level 12, in which 
liquid a refrigerant, e.g ammonia, is dissolved. This solution, 
which is relatively rich in refrigerant, is called a rich 
solution. The rich solution exits from the absorber 10 through 
a conduit 14 and enters a boiler 16, in which the rich solution 
is supplied with heat from an electric heating cartridge 18. 
Refrigerant vapor boils off from the rich solution which 
thereby becomes a so-called weak solution. The mixture of 
refrigerant vapor and weak solution is expelled through

<CLAIMS>
Absorber for an absorption refrigerating apparatus, which 
absorber (10) shows an inlet (42) for a liqid, flowing 

downwards through the absorber and absorbing a refrigerant, 
which in gaseous form flows through the absorber, the absorber 

being constituted by two joined plates (52 and 54, 
respectively), which between themselves form a plurality of 

substantially horizontal ducts (60), arranged above each other, 
for the refrigerant, 
characterized
 in that the plates on the 
inside of the absorber are treated in a way which promotes that 

the inside is wetted by the liquid and that the bottom of the 
ducts show small openings (64, 72, 74), through which the 

liquid leaks down into the roof of a duct located below and 
moves downwards along its roof and walls. 
Absorber according to claim 1, the plates being joined 
together by welding, 
characterized
 in that the openings (64, 
72, 74) are formed of portions between the plates, which 

portions have been left unwelded. 
Absorber according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that 
the respective plate on its inside is provided with one set of 

parallel grooves (72) crossing another set of parallel grooves 
(74). 
Absorber according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the 
grooves (72, 74) form an angle (α) with the horizontal, which 

angle is between 3 and 12 degrees. 
Absorber according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the 
angle (α) is about 5 degrees.
