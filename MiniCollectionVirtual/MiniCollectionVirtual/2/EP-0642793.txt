<ABSTRACT>
An apoptosis inducer containing baicalin or baicalein as the active ingredient and utilizable as carcinostatic agent, antiviral 
agent, and so forth. It can be used advantageously as a new type of safe carcinostatic or anticancer drug, because it induces 

apoptosis programmed even in cancer cells and hence can kill cancer cells which are believed to be immortal. It is useful also in 
treating various diseases caused by viral infection, because it can induce apoptosis in various virally infected tissues or cells, 

which have been believed to be difficult to remove, to thereby permit easy removal of these tissues or cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apoptosis 
inducer which can be used as a drug such as carcinostatic 
agent, antiviral agent, and the like. In recent years, the manner of cell death called 
apoptosis (programed cell death or cell suicide) is 
attracting an attention. Differently from necrosis which 
is pathologic death of cells, in the case of apoptosis 
the cause of cell death is considered to be incorporated 
in the gene of the cells from the beginning. Specifically, the mechanism is considered such that 
genes programing the apoptosis are activated due to 
certain external or internal factors, so-called "suicide 
proteins" are produced by the genes, and the cells are 
decomposed to death by these suicide proteins. If the apoptosis can be induced in desired cells, it 
is possible to spontaneously exclude unwanted or 
pathogenic cells from organisms. This bears deep 
significance. Glucocorticoide is the only currently known compound 
which can induce apoptosis in cells. Development of a 
compound exhibiting a more excellent apoptosis inducing 
action has been desired.  The present inventors have undertaken screening 
especially on various crude drug components in order to 
find compounds having an apoptosis inducing action, and 
have found that baicalin and baicalein exhibit excellent 
apoptosis inducing action and, further, that Sho-saiko-to 
which contains baicalin and baicalein in a large amount 
also exhibits the same action. These findings have led 
to the completion of the present invention. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is 
to provide an apoptosis inducer comprising baicalin or 
baicalein as an effective ingredient. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a method of inducing apoptosis in organisms 
comprising administering an effective amount of baicalin 
or baicalein. Still another object of the present invention is to 
provide the use of baicalin or baicalein for preparing an 
apoptosis inducer. Figure 1 is photographs of agarose gel 
electrophoresis showing DNA of MT4 cell line fragmented 
by the addition of baicalin, baicalein and Sho-saiko-to; Figure 2 is a photograph showing morphological features 
of KIM-1 cells after the addition of Sho-saiko-to; and  Figure 3 is a photograph of agarose gel electrophoresis 
showing DNA of KIM-1 cells fragmented by the addition of 
Sho-saiko-to. Baicalin and baicalein used as effective ingredients 
in the present invention are compounds shown by the 
following chemical formula, wherein a compound having 
GlcA for R is
