<ABSTRACT>
A forceps structure including a pair of crossed arms (10,12), a stud 
rotationally connecting the arms and a grasping 

opening (10a,12a) defined by 
the ends of the arms (10,12,) which conforms closely to 

the cross-sectional 
shape of the vas deferens or the vagus nerve of the human body, for 

use in surgical procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates primarily to a forceps structure, and 
more particularly to a forceps structure useful in vasectomies, 
surgical interventions in the lower esophagus or stomach and other 
surgical procedures. With over-population in the world today, family planning, 
sterilization and particularly the surgical procedure of vasectomy 
have become common varieties of treatment for the purpose of 
reducing world population. Of course, the foregoing statement is 
applicable as well to pockets of over-population and treatment 
therefor which extends to various locations throughout the world. Considering vasectomy, in particular, a commonly used 
instrument in the procedure is a standard forceps design, such as 
the Allis forceps. Such standard forceps are used to elevate a 
duct in the scrotum used for carrying semen in a male. The duct is 
commonly referred to as the vas deferens, and the purpose of its 
elevation is to expose such duct in order to enable the procedure 
for cutting it, so as to, at least temporarily, interrupt the flow 
of semen. A very important consideration in the surgical procedure is 
the time necessary for the operation. There are two reasons for 
this consideration: firstly, the timing of any surgery is critical 
and; secondly, the great number of procedures done in this area 
unnecessarily burdens the surgeon if the procedure takes longer  
 
than it should. Furthermore, for the purposes of accuracy during 
the surgery, and in order to reduce the time for the procedure, it 
is important that the forceps hold the vas deferens during the 
procedure without slippage thereof. It is also a consideration that the incision for the proceudre 
be as small as possible. With standard forceps used for vasectomies, the scissors-like 
construction includes, of course, a locking mechanism for the two 
arms and an opening defined by the ends of such arms opposite the 
ends which have the grasping handles. Such openings, defined at 
the ends of the arms, are typically elongated openings, so that the 
grasping action is accomplished with a closed, but elongated loop. 
This allows slippage, which in turn affects the timing of the 
procedure, and also requires a larger incision than that necessary 
with the present invention. The forceps art, as it exists at this time, can be represented 
by three patents, British patent No. 4688, published in 1894; U. S. 
Patent No. 2,642,871 to Thuerig; and U. S. Patent No. 2,397,823 to 
Walter. None anticipate the invention, which is the subject of 
this
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A forceps for use in grasping and pulling an elongated 
human body part, comprising a pair of intersecting, elongated 

forceps arms, a stud at said intersection, a handle at a first end 
of each of said arms, and said arms defining a pair of facing 

openings for said grasping at a second end of said arms, said 
facing openings defining a closed, generally circularly shaped 

opening, when said forceps are closed, of a size approximating the 
cross-sectional size of said part. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said size is 
approximately 0.40 cm. long and 0.25 cm. wide. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said part is 
the vas deferens. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said part is 
the vagus nerve. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said part is 
the vagus nerve and said arms are approximately 6 cm. longer, 

between said stud and handles, than when said part is a vas 
deferens. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said definition 
is of an oval. 
The invention according to claim 1 wherein said definition 
is of an ellipse.
