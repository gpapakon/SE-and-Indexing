<ABSTRACT>
The invention described herein transforms the conventional alternating feed dampening units of offset printing presses into micro-controlled continuous film dampening units incorporating the principal components and mechanisms of the original dampening units in order to preserve, among other things, perfect geometry with respect to the other parts of the press. The water take-up roller (4A), the dampening distributor roller (8A) and the dampening form roller (9A) retain their positions with modified original mechanisms and functions. The removable module (55) is located by using the locating devices of the original water duct roller. Its regulator roller (66) links the water take-up roller (4A) with the transfer roller (63) pressing against the dampening distributor roller (8A). Its liaison roller (82) establishes continuity on demand, between the dampening unit and the inking unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein concerns the traditional dampening units of 
offset printing presses and relates to a procedure designed to transform the 
principles and mode of their operation. The purpose of these conversions is to 
endow dampening units modified according to the invention with 
characteristics and operational possibilities similar to those possessed by 
dampening units of recent design, which function according to principles and 
with a degree of precision that make it possible to obtain easily and instantly 
correct ratios of water to ink and close integration of the dampening and inking 
processes, the determining parameters which have enabled this method of 
printing to be developed. The principle characteristic of this conversion, the 
subject of the invention, is that the design and construction of the modified 
dampening units re-incorporates the main components and mechanisms of 
the original dampening unit, in order to retain their perfect geometry with 
respect to the other mechanisms of the press with which they work in harmony 
to perform correctly all the operations for dampening the printing plate. This 
procedure makes it possible to produce, at low cost, dampening units which 
are as totally integral to the press as the original dampening units of which 
they are the direct issue and to incorporate, directly and at reduced cost 
during manufacture of these presses, all the conversions which are the 
subject of the invention using means similar to those proposed for the 
application of the invention. In its various forms, the invention makes it possible to choose the mode of 
continuous film dampening which is best suited to the types of printing press 
to be modified, sheet by sheet or continuous, as a function of their inking rate 
and the printing jobs that they carry out. At present, the great majority of offset printing presses are equipped with 
conventional dampening units. These units, which are relatively primitive in 
design, perform their overall function of dampening an offset printing plate, but 
possess certain serious weaknesses in the mode and precision of their 
operation. Their dampening water feed is by alternating flow from a reservoir 
constituting a general supply. The rollers which convey the dampening water  
 
to the printing plate are covered with a sleeve of spongy fabric designed, once 
they are wetted, to carry a reserve of a considerable quantity of dampening 
water, reasonably well distributed throughout the sleeves, but in very 
approximate

A procedure for transforming conventional dampening units from

(66) and the liaison roller (82), the whole being located on and fixed to the 
press so as to be detachable, using the position of the original water duct

same manner,
