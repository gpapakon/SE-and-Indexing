<ABSTRACT>
An attachment to be fitted onto the barrel of a hair dryer comprises a 
water tank (3), a spray nozzle (5) and a trigger-operated pump for drawing 

water from the tank to the spray outlet. In use, when the attachment is 
fitted to a hair dryer, it is possible (when desired) to provide a spray of 

water at the same time as hot air for drying the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an attachment for use with a hair dryer for providing a spray 
of water for use while drying hair. In the final stages of a hair-dressing operation, a hair-dresser often finds it 
advantageous to slightly dampen the hair to achieve optimum results. Although it may seem 
paradoxical, it is sometimes desirable to slightly dampen the hair during the drying process. Conventionally this spray is provided by using a bottle or similar container having a 
spray outlet. This is disadvantageous, however, in that one hand is needed for the spray 
bottle and one for the hair-dryer, leaving no hand free for simultaneously using a brush, 
comb, scissors or tongs etc as may be required. There is known in the prior art US 3,745,306 which discloses a steam generating 
means integrally formed with a hairdryer. Steam is generated and is entrained in the steam 
of hot air produced by the hairdryer. However, in order to generate the steam an electric 
heating element is required, the power for which must be taken from the power source for 
the hairdryer. This complicates the structure of the hairdryer and means that the steam 
generating means cannot be used with a conventional hairdryer. According to the invention there is provided an attachment for a hair dryer 
comprising means for receiving the barrel of a hair dryer, a water tank formed integrally 
with said receiving means, a spray outlet, and pump means for drawing water from said tank 
to said spray outlet.  By means of this arrangement a hair dryer may be provided with a water spray, thus 
leaving one hand free for using another tool. The barrel receiving means may be of a generally cylindrical shape having open ends. 
Preferably the receiving means is formed with a taper so that the attachment may be 
"wedged" onto the barrel of the hairdryer. To help secure engagement of the barrel within 
the receiving means, a pad of rubber or similar elastomeric material may be provided on the 
interior of the cylindrical portion. The spray outlet is preferably provided adjacent the open 
end of the barrel receiving portion remote from the hair dryer where hot air exits the dryer 
and attachment. The pump may comprise any simple configuration, and is preferably operable by 
means of a trigger. In preferred arrangements the trigger is located in use in such a position 
that it may easily be reached by the fingers of a hand already holding the handle of the hair 
dryer itself. Preferably the pump may comprise a pump cylinder having a piston slidably
