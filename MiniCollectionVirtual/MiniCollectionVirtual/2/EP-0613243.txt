<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuits for converting electric 
quantities, in particular to monolithically integrated 
converter circuits of the antilogarithmic or linear-exponential 
type. Converters of this kind are used in a number of 
applications, such as automatic gain control systems where 
a signal, whose amplitude may vary within a wide range, is 
to be amplified such that a signal having a predetermined 
constant maximum amplitude can be output. The simplest way of obtaining a linear-exponential 
conversion is to utilize the exponential characteristic of 
a bipolar junction of the PN type. In this case, the converter circuits as designed by the 
skilled technician would be represented schematically by an 
operational amplifier having the cathode of a diode 
connected to its inverting input terminal, with the latter 
being connected to the output terminal through a resistor. 
The non-inverting input terminal of the amplifier is 
connected to a ground point. The anode of the diode is the 
input terminal. For opposite polarity signals, the diode connection would 
be reversed. The operational amplifier may be implemented to varying 
degrees of complexity using conventional techniques. That circuit arrangement has, however, an inherent problem 
in that the value of the anode-cathode voltage of the diode  
 
is tied to such variations in the processing parameters as 
the "spread", and above all, temperature. The underlying technical problem of this invention is to 
provide a linear-exponential converter circuit which, while 
utilizing the exponential characteristic of a bipolar 
junction of the PN type, is unaffected by variations in 
processing parameters and can be compensated for 
temperature in a simple and effective manner. This technical problem is solved by a linear-exponential 
converter circuit as specified in Claim 1 being 
characterized in that it comprises a diode connected 
between a low-impedance reference voltage and a non-inverting 
interface circuit having unity gain. The features and advantages of a converter circuit 
according to the invention will become apparent from the 
following description of an embodiment thereof, given by 
way of example and not of limitation with reference to the 
accompanying drawings. In the drawings: 
Figure 1 shows a circuit diagram of a converter according 
to the invention; and Figure 2 shows a circuit diagram of a temperature 
compensatory means which may be added to the circuit 
diagram of Figure 1. Detailed DescriptionThe diagram of Figure 1 shows a
