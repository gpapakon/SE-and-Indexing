<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic 
materials and in particular to speed enhancing and 
post-processing stabilization of photothermographic 
silver-containing materials. Silver halide containing photothermographic 
imaging materials processed with heat, and without 
liquid development have been known in the art for many 
years. These materials, also known as dry silver 
materials, generally comprise a support having thereon 
a photographic light-sensitive silver halide, a light-insensitive 
organic silver salt, and a reducing agent 
for the organic silver salt. The light-sensitive silver halide is in catalytic 
proximity to the light-insensitive organic silver salt 
so that the latent image, formed by irradiation of the 
silver halide, serves as a catalyst nucleus for the 
oxidation-reduction reaction of the organic silver salt 
with the reducing agent when the emulsion is heated 
above about 80°C. Such media are described, for 
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,457,075; 3,839,049; and 
4,260,677. The silver halide may also be generated in 
the media by a preheating step in which halide ion is 
released to form silver halide. A variety of ingredients may be added to these 
basic components to enhance performance. For example, 
toning agents may be incorporated to improve the color  
 
of the silver image of the photothermographic emulsions, 
as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,846,136; 
3,994,732 and 4,021,249. Various methods to produce 
dye images and multicolor images with photographic 
color couplers and leuco dyes are known and described 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,022,617; 3,531,286; 3,180,731; 
3,761,270; 4,460,681; 4,883,747 and Research 
Disclosure, March 1989, item 29963. A common problem that exists with photothermographic 
systems is post-processing instability of the 
image. The photoactive silver halide still present in 
the developed image may continue to catalyze print-out 
of metallic silver during room light handling or 
exposure to heat or humidity. Thus, there exists a 
need for stabilization of the unreacted silver halide. 
The addition of separate post-processing image 
stabilizers have been used to impart post-processing 
stability. Most often these are sulfur containing 
compounds such as mercaptans, thiones, and thioethers 
as described in Research Disclosure, June 1978, item 
17029. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,245,033; 4,837,141; and 
4,451,561 describe sulfur compounds that are 
development restrainers for photothermographic systems.
