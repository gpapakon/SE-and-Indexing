<CLAIMS>
Leaktight sliding device, comprising a cylinder 
(1), a piston (2) sliding inside this cylinder in an 

axial direction, and an annular seal (3) ensuring leak-tightness 
between the cylinder and the piston, the latter 

comprising an internal axial tapping (4) designed to 
receive a screw (6), characterized in that the piston is 

essentially formed by a cylindrical sleeve (2a) bearing 
said tapping, and by a cap (2a) closing the sleeve and 

rendered integral with the latter by an annular connection 
(7), and in that the seal (3) is borne by the cap 

(2b). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that said annular connection (7) comprises a thread. 
Device according to any of the preceeding claims, 
characterised in that the cap and the sleeve comprise 

complementary cylindrical guiding surfaces (8a, 8b). 
Device according to any of the preceeding claims, 
characterised in that the cap is crimped onto the sleeve. 
Device according to any of the preceeding claims, 
characterized in that it is built in a brake actuator 

with automatic adjustment.
