<ABSTRACT>
A strong and light wall panel, consisting of thin side panels of fibre reinforced concrete and intermediate insulating material, such as mineral wool or cellular plastic. The fibre reinforcement is comprised of a mixture of steel fibres and plastic fibres, preferably polypropylene, which have been oriented during the casting with a means comprising a container (2) for mixing of concrete and fibres with a vibrating means (4) for obtaining a uniform mixture and a damper (3) for controlling of the outflowing amount. An output feeder (5) with variable inclination and a vibrating means (6) guide the flow, and a wiper (10) controls the thickness (9) and the laying out on a casting table (7) or on the intermediate insulation. Controlling of the flow of concrete and orientation of the fibres are achieved with guide rails (8). For the use in outside facings the outmost layer of the outer panel does not contain any steel fibres but only plastic fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
Wall panel and method and device for manufacturing this panelThe present invention relates to a composite wall panel with outer sides of concrete and with intermediate insulating material.Small houses, as well as houses with several stories, and industrial buildings are now generally built with walls made of prefabricated panels.Wall panels made of reinforced concrete, now in use, usually consist of two, at least five centimetres thick reinforced concrete layers with intermediate insulating material. A layer thickness of at least five centimetres is required for the concrete to give sufficient protection of the reinforcement, since if the reinforcing steel starts to rust, it will expand and may break the concrete layers. Concrete panels with a thickness of five centimetres are comparatively heavy; the density is about 2.4, and the panels therefore have to be mechanically connected to each other. One object of the invention is to produce wall panels, which are less heavy and have better thermal and sound isolating properties than previously known wall panels. The wall panels according to the invention also become more easy to handle than the previously known panels.According to the invention, the wall panels are produced from two thin panels of concrete reinforced with oriented fibres and intermediate insulating material, preferably of mineral wool. The concrete sides are fixed by the steel fibres at the intermediate insulating material layer, forming a sandwich construction. The comparatively thin concrete sides and the intermediate, comparatively thick insulating material provide a very good sound-proofing and thermal insulation.The panels according to the invention thus consist of two thin fibre concrete panels with intermediate insulating material, such as mineral wool or cellular plastic. In partition walls and in so called "joint spacing elements" the panels need not be structural elements, but instead the inherent strength of the thin concrete panels is quite sufficient, and the elements thus will be light. For 

structural elements, the bracing only are made of fibre concrete, which fact, however, need not increase the weight of the panels with more than 20 - 22 kg/m2.The invention is characterized in that very thin fibre concrete panels are cast together with intermediate insulating material into strengthwise cooperating and very light wall panels, and in that a mixture of steel fibres and plastic fibres in the concrete attach to the insulating layer, when the form is vibrated. The mixture of

CLAIMS
1. A composite wall panel with sides of concrete and with intermediate insulating material, such as mineral wool or cellular plastic, characterized in that the concrete is reinforced with steel fibres and plastic fibres, oriented such as to give a high strength, and in that the panel with the cast sides and the intermediate insulation has been vibrated at the casting so that a strong connection between insulation and fibre concrete sides have been obtained.
2. A wall panel according to claim 1, characterized in that the reinforcement is comprised of 1.0 - 1.5 % by volume of steel fibres and 0.2 - 0.5 % by volume of plastic fibres. 3. A wall panel according to claim 1, characterized in that the cast sides have been manufactured from high strength concrete with a compressive strength of between 80 and 120 MPa.
4. A wall panel according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, for use as outer facing, the outmost layer of the outer panel does not contain any steel fibres, whereby the outmost layer can be completely even or show different types of structure.
5. A wall panel according to any of claims 1 - 4, characterized in that structural elements have stiffening of fibre concrete.
6. A wall panel according to any of claims 1 - 5, characterized by a shearing strength of 28 kPa or above, a bending moment of 14.6 kNm/m or above, a fire classification A 120 and in that a panel with the dimensions 2.4 x 3.0 metres can be loaded with a compressive force of 114 kN without being deformed.
7. Method of manufacturing a wall panel of reinforced fibre concrete, characterized in that firstly an inner panel of concrete reinforced with oriented steel fibres and plastic fibres is cast, that subsequently insulating material is put in, and that finally an outer panel is cast, which is made of the same type of fibre concrete as the inner panel, whereby the panel in its casting form is vibrated during the castings 



so that a strong connection is obtained between the concrete panels and the insulation in that their surface layers diffuse into each other.
8. Method according to claim 7, characterized in that the side panels are manufactured by mixing the fibres into concrete and orienting the fibres by feeding the mixture over a vibrating feeding-out plane with variable inclination and past guide rails, which, simultaneously with the vibration, guide the flow of the mixture over the feeding out plane towards the casting form.
9. Method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that the thickness of the panel is variable by means of that the inclination of the feeding-out means and the heights of the wiper and the casting table are variable. 10. A means for orientation of the fibres in the side panels of a wall panel according to any of claims 1 - 6, characterized by a container (2) for mixing of concrete and fibres with a vibrating means (4) for obtaining a uniform mixture, a damper (3) for controlling the amount flowing out, an output feeder (5) with variable inclination and with a vibrating means (6) for guiding the flow, a wiper (10) for controlling the thickness (9) at the lying out on a casting table (7) and guide rails (8) for guiding of the stream of concrete and orientation of the fibres. 11. A means according to claim 10, characterized in that a variable vibrating means (4) is arranged on the container (2) in order to keep a uniform consistency and to prevent sedimentation and in that optionally a slowly rotatable screw is provided within the container for blending the fibres.
