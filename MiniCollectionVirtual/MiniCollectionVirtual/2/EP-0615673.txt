<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to the electronic transmission
of confidential information, and more particularly to methods and apparatus
for encrypting and decrypting confidential data for transmission over
telephone lines and air waves.Increasing volumes of confidential information are routinely transmitted
over public airwaves and telephone lines on a daily basis. In the banking
and credit industries, for example, remote access to account information
and the ability to transfer substantial sums of money through electronic
funds transfers ("EFT") from a telephone, modem, or automatic teller
machine ("ATM") are commonplace. Moreover, consumers are becoming more and
more accustomed to shopping for goods and services and charging their
purchases to credit card accounts in a single telephone transaction.With the increased popularity of telephone lines and airwaves as the
preferred media for the exchange of confidential financial and related
information, the need to secure that data from unauthorized access is
readily apparent. Indeed, the same factors which facilitate convenient
remote access to savings, checking and credit card accounts also permit the
unauthorized user of the associated confidential account data to
fraudulently access such accounts, resulting in substantial abuse.Efforts to curb the unauthorized access to and use of confidentially
transmitted data have been only moderately successful. For example, the
use of a personal identification number ("PIN") to access accounts is
ineffective against fraudulent access once the PIN is intercepted.
Moreover, the effectiveness of fixed encryption schemes is inherently
limited to the extent the encryption scheme may be derived by analyzing
intercepted encrypted data.A method for encoding and decoding confidential data for transmission over
public media is therefore needed which is both robust and which is not
readily derivable through unauthorized access. US-A-4935961 discloses a method and apparatus for generating cryptographic keys for
a postal manifest and for synchronizing cryptographic keys for transmitting postal data
securely on a communication link. The techniques for generating a key
and for synchronizing keys use the same apparatus but use slightly different data to
create a cryptographic key. The postal data center maintains a unique set of data for
each server station. Using this set of data along with a manifest sequence number (or
communication transaction number) and the date, a cryptographic key is created. Each
server
