<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for introducing gas into liquids having a gas distributor (10) which can be connected to a gas supply device and has a base body (16) and a wall (18) with perforations surrounding this, the wall being able to be impinged from the inside with gas via a gas inlet (34) of the base body (16). The wall is encircled in a ring-like manner by an adjusting means (74) in such a way that the wall abuts the base body in the region of the adjusting means (74), at any rate without gas impingement. The adjusting means (74) can be slid along the base body (10).

Device for gasifying fluids, in particular for aerating waste water, 
with a gas distributor (10) connectable to a gas supply device, with a 

basic body (16), preferably essentially cylindrical and preferably 
which can be arranged with a vertical longitudinal axis (75) and 

preferably in its base (28) equipped with one or more fluid channels 
(38 to 44) in flow connection with its interior (88), and a preferably 

hose-shaped side (18) surrounding the said basic body (16) like a 
membrane and made of elastic material with perforations (84, 86), where 

the side (18) can be impacted by gas from its inside via a gas inlet 
(30) from the basic body (16), characterised in that between its axial 

end areas by which it is held on the basic body (16), the side (18) is 
surrounded in a ring-like manner by an adjustment means (74), that the 

side (18) lies against the basic body (16) in all cases without gas 
impact in the area of the adjustment means (74), and that the 

adjustment means (74) can be displaced in the direction of the 
longitudinal axis (75) of the basic body (16). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the adjustment means 
(74) are formed as at least one sleeve (76) of elastic material which 

surrounds the side (18). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the number of 
perforations (84, 86) of the side (18) per surface unit and/or the size 

of the perforations (84, 86) in the gas flow direction (78), diminishes 
preferably upwards in the vertical direction. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, characterised in that 
the gas volume flow which can be passed to the side (18) via the gas 

inlet (30) is adjustable by means of an adjustment element (46) in the 
basic body (16) adjustable from the outside. 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the gas inlet (30) 
is provided in the base (28) of the basic body (16) as an axial, 

preferably centric bore (51) from which one or more preferably radial 
connecting channels (34, 36) branch out in the direction of the side 

(18), where the adjustment element (46) - depending on position - is 
held in the bore (51) more or less overlapping the adjustment channels  

 
(34, 36). 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the adjustment 
element (46) has a first section (48) and a second section (50) with a 

greater external diameter and between the sections (48, 50) an annular 
shoulder (49) with which the adjustment element (46) lies against an 

annular shoulder (65) of the bore (51). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the second section 
(50) is held in the bore (51) of the gas inlet (30) and the first 

section (48) extends into the interior (88) of the basic body (16) open 
at the front. 
Device according to any of claims 6 or 7, characterised in that the 
first section (48) is surrounded by an end wall (64) of the bore (51) 

forming the annular shoulder (65). 
Device according to any of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that between 
the annular shoulders (49, 65) is arranged an annular seal (72) 

surrounding the adjustment element (46). 
Device according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that an annular seal 
(70) surrounding the first section (48) sits on the outside of the end 

wall (64). 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 10, characterised in that the 
adjustment element (46) has an annular wall (66) in the area of the 

second section (50) with one or more recesses (68) which can be brought 
to align with the opening cross section of one or more of the 

connecting channels (34, 36). 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 11, characterised in that the 
adjustment element (46) has a head section (60) connecting with the 

first section (48) and is equipped with means of adjustment, preferably 
twisting, of the adjustment element (46), in particular by means of a 

corresponding tool, from the interior (88) open at the end. 
Device according to claim 12, characterised in that the head section 
(60) has a twist slot (62).  

 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 13, characterised in that the 
adjustment element (46) has at least one drainage water opening (54) 

which can be controlled open or closed. 
Device according to claim 14, characterised in that the adjustment 
element (46) has a bore (52) opening into the gas inlet (30) and that 

the drainage water openings (54, 46) forming radial channels in the 
area of the head section (60) are arranged in the outer wall (57) of 

the bore. 
Device according to claim 14 or 15, characterised in that the 
adjustment element (46) is surrounded by a shell (58) of elastic 

material at least in the area of the drainage openings (54, 56). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 16, characterised in that the 
holes of the perforations (84, 86) of the side (18) and/or the shell 

(58) are punched or pierced under pretension of the elastic material 
forming these. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 17, characterised in that the 
holes of the perforations (84, 86) are formed circular, slotted or 

star-shaped in cross section, in particular wedge-shaped or tapered in 

their depth.
