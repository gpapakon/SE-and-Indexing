<ABSTRACT>
A data storage system 10 includes a data storage medium 17, such as 
a magnetic tape 21, that has a first control data storing area or drive 

partition thatis addressable only by a peripheral drive mounting the 
medium and a plurality of other addressable data storing partitions for 

storing data. A volume table of contents may be stored in one of the 
addressable partitions. A tachometer 22 measures and indicates physical 

locations on the storage medium. Each of the partitions have an extent 
on the storage medium indicated by said physical locations. The control 

data in the drive partition includes directories of medium control 
blocks, such as tape marks, defect marks and the like; directory of all 

addressable partitions including the physical locations at the beginning 
of each partitions and other medium physical and logical parameter data. 

A so-called mount-demount medium control block in the drive partition 
indicates a demount status that shows all data stored in the drive 

partition is valid. Loading a storage medium into a drive does not mount 
the drive for recording and reading. First, a copy of the drive 

partition stored data is copied to a memory in the peripheral drive and 
the mount-demount medium control block is marked to indicate the storage 

medium is mounted. Then, the peripheral drive can indicate to an 
attaching unit that the storage medium is mounted for use in data 

processing activities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data storage devices including control of 
record media by a device independently of attaching host processors and 
the like. Prior data storage subsystems required host processor intervention 
in data storage subsystem operations for performing high speed searches 
(tape head is not in contact with the tape that is moving faster than 
tape speed during reading or writing), scanning a record medium (a slow 
speed search wherein the head is in transducing contact with the tape for 
reading block ID's, for example), particularly a magnetic tape medium, 
until a desired logical block is located on the record medium. This 
situation creates undesired performance problems in those data storage 
systems employing record media that stores an order of magnitude more 
data than prior are record media. Eliminating or reducing the prior art 
required host intervention in other aspects of data storage subsystems 
also increases the efficiency of host processor operations in that 
attention needed to operate with data storage subsystem operations has 
been eased. The prior art provided a directory in each record media that is 
created, updated and managed by software in a host processor attached to 
a data storage subsystem. One representative example of such a directory 
is shown by Kulakowski et al in US patent 4,939,598. A volume table of 
contents (VTOC), another name for a directory recorded on a record 
medium, for an optical disk file is created, updated and managed by an 
attaching personal computer, a low performance host processor. Such VTOC 
included status of addressable data-storage areas on the optical disk 
data storage medium. Other prior art data storage systems employ similar 
techniques. Such record medium stored directories typically included 
addressing capability requiring a host processor to execute software that 
addresses a medium, rather than allowing a data storage subsystem to 
address internal data structures of a record medium independently of host 
processor software. It is desired to remove dependency of addressing  
 
internal data structures of a record medium from host processor executed 
software. An example representative of such addressing directories is 
shown in Kulakowski et al US patent 4,575,827. Magnetic tape record 
media also often included host created, updated and managed records that 
enabled host processor software to access records stored in a magnetic 
tape volume. As stated in Kulakowski et al, such control records were 
termed "tape
