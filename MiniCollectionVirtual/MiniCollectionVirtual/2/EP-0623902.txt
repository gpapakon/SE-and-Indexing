<ABSTRACT>
A device for use in a bank note container such as a 
preloaded cassette used in cash dispensers having the 

purpose of rendering unusable the bank notes in the 
container in the case there is detected (preferably by 

electronic means) a violation, attempted theft or 
unauthorised manoeuvre to displace or remove the container, 

which device comprises: 

a first ink reservoir (1) containing a liquid colouring 
material, 
a second removable reservoir (8) containing a 
pressurized gas, 
adjacent thereof, an actuator (9) connected to a 
detection system (11), in order to liberate the 

pressurized gas from said second reservoir if required 
by said detection system, 
ink discharging means (15) connected to the ink 
reservoir via a retaining valve (14),


characterised in that,

 
the first reservoir comprises an elastic sealing 

membrane (2) extending substantially on one side and 
delimiting a second compartment which, in response to 

said detection system, may be inflated by the 
pressurized gas liberated from the second reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a new device to be
adapted in a bank note container such as a preloaded
cassette used in cash dispensers.The purpose of the device is to render unusable the bank
notes in the container in the case there is detected a
violation, attempted theft or unauthorised manoeuvre to
displace or remove the container. This is detected
preferably by a suitable electronic means.In the case of containers for transportation, for example
suitcases, it is well known to include devices that will, in
the case of theft or aggression, invalidate the bank notes
which are contained therein. This is achieved by
automatically spraying a coloured liquid, for example as a
consequence of a controlled explosion. The ink will
preferably be indelible.For this purpose, several systems are known. Among them, a
device is known which includes a cylinder containing the ink
and a piston that will be actuated, in the case of theft,
via electronic or mechanical means and possibly a CO2
cartridge or canister.Another device comprises an ink reservoir and a CO2
cartridge which once actuated will eject the ink mixed with
the gas in the container. In the latter case, a substantial
portion of the ink is not delivered onto the stacks of bank
notes.A document marker described in US-A-5 156 272 comprises a
spongy element capable of delivering a discoloring liquid to
documents juxtaposed with the element whereby migration of
liquid to the documents is caused. The liquid may be
discharged from a tank onto the element by gas pressure.A foam marking device described in US-A-4 799 435 comprises
a cylindrical accumulator divided by a deformable sac on one
side of which is provided a source of gas under pressure and 
on the other side of which is provided a marker liquid which
is foamable when contacted with air by discharge through
suitably connected valve means, the foam so formed being
discharged to mark items of value such as banknotes.These devices are complicated and not very reliable due to
the presence of mechanical parts and the possibility of
blockage.The present invention is to overcome these problems, and is
directed towards providing a new device for staining,
preferably permanently, the bank notes in a container, such
container being preferably for use in an automatic cash
dispenser.The device according to the invention is preferably adapted
for being a part of a preloaded bank note cassette. Such a
cassette is generally elongated and contains a stack of bank
notes which may be individually delivered through

<CLAIMS>
A device adapted to be incorporated in a bank note
container comprising:


an ink reservoir (1) having rigid walls for containing
a liquid colouring material,
a removable reservoir (8) containing a pressurized gas,
and
adjacent thereof, an actuator (9) connected to a
detection system (11), in order to liberate the

pressurized gas from said second reservoir if required
by said detection system,
ink discharging means (15) connected to the ink
reservoir via a retaining valve (14),

   
characterised in that,
one of the walls of the ink reservoir is covered by an
elastic sealing membrane (2) which, in response to said

detection system, is inflated by the pressurized gas
liberated from the removable reservoir, and said

sealing membrane covers a rigid plate (3) comprising a
plurality of grooves (4) and is fixed to the rigid

walls (6) of the ink reservoir.
A device according to claim 1 wherein the
removable reservoir is located in a separate chamber (7)

adjacent to the ink reservoir and connected therewith
through a pipe (26) or a hole (12).
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the
discharging means is an elongated perforated pipe (27).
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the
device further comprises a bank note container, which is a

preloaded bank note cassette for a bank note dispenser.
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the
membrane is made of an elastomer.
A device according to claim 5 wherein the membrane is
made of rubber.
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the
retaining valve is a ball valve.
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the
detection system is an electronic detection system.
