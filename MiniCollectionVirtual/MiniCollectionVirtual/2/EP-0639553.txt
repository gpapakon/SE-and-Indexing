<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for
producing phenol or alkyl phenol and to a method for
producing phenol or alkyl phenol by gas phase oxidation of
benzoic acid or alkyl benzoic acid under the presence of the
catalyst.Various methods and catalysts are known to produce
phenol by gas phase contact oxidation of benzoic
acid.For example, JP-A-57-11932 (the term JP-A- referred to
hereinafter signifies unexamined Japanese patent
publication) disclosed a catalyst containing at least one
of a copper compound, a vanadium compound, a silver
compound, a lithium compound, a sodium compound, and a
magnesium compound, and a method using the catalyst.JP-B-59-20384 (the term JP-B- referred to hereinafter
signifies examined Japanese patent publication) disclosed a
method using a catalyst containing oxides of copper, 
zirconium, and alkali metal and being supported on α-alumina.
JP-B-64-934 disclosed a method using an oxide
catalyst containing a variety of metallic elements:
namely, molybdenum as the essential component , at least one
of vanadium, niobium, and tantalum, and at least one of
copper, silver, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium,
palladium, and platinum, and at least one of thallium, an
alkali metal, and an alkaline earth metal.The inventors conducted extensive study on the catalyst
for phenol production and on the method for producing
phenol, and provided the catalysts to produce phenol by gas
phase contact oxidation of benzoic acid, which catalysts
include the catalyst of a nickel compound supported on a
metallic oxide such as titania, magnesia, and α-alumina
(JP-A-4-5250), the catalyst containing an iron oxide and a
nickel oxide (JP-A-4-330944), the catalyst containing an
iron oxide, a nickel oxide, and an alkali earth metal
compound (JP-A-4-330945), the catalyst containing an iron
oxide, a nickel oxide, and an alkali metal compound (JP-A-4-104837),
the catalyst containing an iron oxide, a nickel
oxide, an alkali metal compound, and an alkaline earth metal
compound (JP-A-4-330946), and the catalyst containing a
composite metallic oxide having a spinel crystal structure.Furthermore, the inventors provided a catalyst to produce
phenol by gas phase oxidation of toluene, which catalyst 
contains a vanadium oxide, an iron oxide, and a
nickel oxide (JP-A-4-277029).However, the catalyst disclosed in JP-A-57-11932 is
insufficient in both activity and selectivity, and the
method for producing phenol using the catalyst gives the
conversion of benzoic acid of 50.5% and the selectivity to
phenol of
