<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spectroscopy, and
more particularly to the use of infrared absorption
spectroscopy in identification of an unknown gas.Infrared absorption spectroscopy involves
generating an infrared spectrum for a material such as a
gas or vapour. A material's infrared spectrum is a
measure of the tendency of the material to absorb
infrared energy having wavelengths that vary across a
predetermined band of infrared wavelengths. For example,
many applications use the mid-infrared spectral band,
which includes wavelengths from 2.5 micrometers to
approximately 14 micrometers. The material's infrared
spectrum is generated by measuring the degree of
absorption for each wavelength in the spectrum, and
plotting absorption versus wavelength.Different chemical compounds produce vastly
differing characteristic spectral profiles or
"signatures" over the mid-infrared spectral band, by
which they can be readily recognized. Thus, to identify
an unknown gas, the infrared spectrum of the unknown gas
is visually or mathematically compared with the infrared
spectra of a number of reference gases. By comparing the
unknown spectrum with a library of reference compounds,
the most likely match to the unknown gas can be
determined. If the shape of the infrared spectrum of the
unknown gas matches that of the infrared spectrum of a
reference gas within a defined tolerance, there is a high
probability that the two gases are the same.US Patent 4 818 875 discloses a portable battery-operated
ambient air analyzer comprising an electrically
energized incandescent source of infrared radiation
producing a beam passing through an air sample to a sensor.
The infrared source is surrounded by an explosion-proof
enclosure to prevent an explosion internally of the
enclosure being propagated out to the atmosphere. The
incandescent source is a self-supporting filamentary coil 
having no interior coil or mandrel. The coil is formed of
a metal composition including aluminium, chromium and ion.
The beam of infrared radiation produced by the source is
directed to a circular variable filter.In one aspect, generally, the invention features
identifying an unknown gas by generating an infrared 
spectrum of the unknown gas using an infrared
spectrophotometer that includes a circular variable
interference filter, compressing the infrared spectrum of
the unknown gas, and comparing the compressed infrared
spectrum of the unknown gas to a library of compressed
infrared spectra of reference compounds. In some
embodiments, the spectrum of
