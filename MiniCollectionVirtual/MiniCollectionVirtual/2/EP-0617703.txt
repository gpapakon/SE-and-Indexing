<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of inhibiting alkali-silica or alkali-aggregate reactions (AAR/ASR) in concrete structures by introducing lithium compounds or the like in conjunction with conventional techniques for the treatment of steel reinforcement corrosion. It is also proposed to provide lithium compounds in repair concretes, grouts or mortars and use the difference in concentration between the article under repair and the repair material to introduce the lithium ions into the concrete under repair, once again inhibiting AAR/ASR reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that concretes which contain certain 
forms of siliceous aggregate are prone to generate 
expansive reaction products (alkali-silica gel) if 
sufficient concentrations of sodium, potassium and 
hydroxyl ions are present in the concrete pore liquid. 
This phenomenon, known as alkali-aggregate reaction 
(AAR) or alkali-silica reaction (ASR), can give rise to 
deleterious expansion and cracking of the concrete. It has already been proposed to use lithium 
compounds as a means of inhibiting AAR/ASR in concretes 
which contain potentially reactive aggregates. What we now propose is the introduction into, or 
presence of lithium ions (or the like), in hardened 
concrete in conjunction with specific techniques of 
reinforcement corrosion control or concrete repair so 
that the lithium ions are conveyed to local sites 
within the concrete where AAR/ASR is most likely to be 
initiated. Alternatively the lithium compounds may be 
introduced during the manufacture of a concrete article 
when using a reinforcing technique. Thus we primarily 
intend to use lithium ions in solutions, slurries or 
admixtures for treatment of existing concrete 
structures, but lithium ions, or the like, could be 
deliberately provided in the original concrete in 
anticipation of some form of subsequent treatment of 
steel reinforcement corrosion. A number of techniques that are used for the 
treatment of steel reinforcement corrosion in concrete 
structures can cause localised enhancement of the 
concentrations of sodium, potassium and hydroxyl ions  
 
in the concrete pore liquid, thereby increasing the 
risk of expansion and cracking due to AAR/ASR in 
concretes that contain susceptible aggregates. (Such 
corrosion treatment techniques include cathodic 
protection, electrochemical desalination, 
electrochemical realkalisation, and patch repair with 
cementitious mortar, grout or concrete). The invention is concerned with the application of 
lithium compounds in conjunction with the 
aforementioned techniques for the treatment of steel 
reinforcement corrosion, with the aim of inhibiting or 
preventing AAR/ASR from arising as a deleterious 
side-effect. The effectiveness of lithium compounds as 
a means of inhibiting or arresting AAR/ASR in concretes 
which contain potentially reactive aggregates is 
thought to depend on the formation at the aggregate 
surface of an insoluble lithium silicate which has 
little tendency to expand in the presence of water. According to a first aspect the invention 
comprises the use of
