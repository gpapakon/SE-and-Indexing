<ABSTRACT>
2. Animal feed additives based on fermentation broth further contain, in addition to the additive, other fermentation broth constituents. Such products, after spray-drying, generally have an excessively low bulk density and/or are sticky. To granulate these products, processing aids have therefore been added, e.g. perlite or sawdust. Alternatively, such products have been dewatered by azeotropic distillation with paraffin oil to give granules. The object of the invention is a highly concentrated animal feed additive which, in particular, is to have a bulk density of at least 550 kg/m
<
3
>
 and a standardisable active compound content. 2.2. By pelletising, stable granules can be produced from an animal feed additive-containing fermentation broth if the fermentation product is contained at at least 33% by weight. Granules can particularly readily be produced by pelletising if the pellets are built up of at least 30% by weight fine grain with at least 70% by weight having a particle size 
<
 100  mu m. The biomass can be contained completely, in part or not at all in the granules. 2.3. Animal feed additives such as lysine, threonine or tryptophan, or containing fermentation broth products.
