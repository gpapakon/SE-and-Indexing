<ABSTRACT>
An operational amplifier for low supply voltage 
applications. The operational amplifier includes 

inverting and non-inverting inputs and a single-ended 
output. The operational amplifier also includes source 

transistors for pushing the output and sink transistors 
for pulling the output to obtain particular output 

voltage swing. Connections between the inputs and 
output include DC biasing circuitry. In low supply 

voltage applications, voltage drop due to transistors 
of amplifier circuitry can be significant and can 

affect possible range of output voltage swing. The DC 
biasing circuitry includes four identically sized n-channel 

transistors; three of the n-channel transistors 
receive a second bias current input and one of the n-channel 

transistors receives a first bias current 
input, identical to the first; three identically sized 

n-channel cascode transistors are connected to the n-channel 
transistor that receives the first bias current 

input and to two of the n-channel transistors receiving 
the second bias current input; the other n-channel 

transistor receives the second bias current input and 
is connected to a correcting transistor of select size 

and characteristics. The correcting transistor serves  
 

to maintain mirrored currents between each of the 
source transistors and each of the sink transistors to 

eliminate the implications of inequivalent voltage drop 
across corresponding series of transistors in the 

amplifier so that the range of output voltage swing, 
even in low supply voltage applications, closely 

approaches the value of the power supply voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention as it is defined in the appended claims relates to operational amplifiers, such as operational amplifiers
for low supply voltage applications, which employ unique DC biasing and current
mirroring schemes.US-A-5 006 817 discloses a prior art CMOS operational amplifier.Operational amplifiers are very high gain DC-coupled amplifiers with single-ended
output. Typically, differential amplifiers are used as the input stage for
operational amplifiers (sometimes referred to herein as "op-amp"). Operational
amplifiers may be thought of as devices with two inputs and one output. The two
inputs may be thought of as 
"non-inverting" and "inverting" signals. When the non
inverting input goes more positive than the inverting
input, the output of the amplifier goes positive, and
vice-versa. Operational amplifiers have enormous
voltage gain and they are typically used with feedback.An ideal op-amp with external feedback has a
relatively simple behavior. First, the output from the
op-amp attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the
voltage difference between the op-amp inputs equal 0.
Second, the op-amp draws very little input current
which, in the ideal situation, approximates no current.
In effect, operational amplifiers behave by "looking"
at the input terminals and swinging the output terminal
around so that the external feedback network brings the
input differential to 0 (if possible). In this ideal
op-amp, the output voltage swing may be as great as the
range of power supply operating voltage. For example,
if a power supply yielding a 0 to 5 volt supply voltage
range operates an op-amp, then the output voltage swing
can theoretically be 0-5 volts. Likewise, in the case
of a power supply yielding a 0 to 2.7 volt supply
voltage range for an op-amp, a 0-2. 7 volt output swing
is theoretically possible. So these are the ideal
cases for a 0-5 supply voltage and a 0-2.7 supply
voltage, respectively. In the real world, these ideal conditions cannot
be absolutely met. The real world op-amp will be
operable around some range at about the mid-voltage of
the power supply operating voltage range, and the
output voltage will swing around this mid-voltage plus
or minus some ΔV, which is something less than the
theoretical output voltage possible given the range of
supply voltage available from the power supply. In
practice, op-amps typically work best at around a mid
voltage, which is considered the common level voltage.
That common level voltage will then swing up to the
plus or minus ΔV which is possible
