<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing stability of a discrete 
data pattern resulting from performing a predefined 

mathematical operation on a first data set subject to 
arbitrary shifts is disclosed. The method comprises 

the step of analyzing the first data set using a 
predefined mathematical operator to produce a second 

data set, detecting and isolating the discrete data 
pattern in the second data set, determining a location 

of the detected and isolated data pattern in the second 
data set, measuring a difference between the location 

of the detected and isolated data pattern and a 
predetermined location of the mathematical operator, 

adjusting preselected parameters of the mathematical 
operator in accordance with the measured location 

difference such that the adjusted mathematical operator 
is aligned with the detected and isolated data pattern, 

and analyzing the first data set using the aligned 
mathematical operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
system and method for analyzing isolated data patterns 
in a signal, and more specifically to such a system and 
method for analyzing a signal having isolated data 
patterns which are arbitrarily shifted. In general, when a data pattern such as a 
digital signal is operated on by a signal processing 
function such as correlation, convolution, or 
transform, an arbitrary shift in the input signal 
causes changes in the output of the signal processing 
function, as well. This effect is aggravated when the 
signal is sampled at a rate close to the critical 
sampling rate. Fig. 1 illustrates an arbitrary shift 
in the sampling of a signal. For many digital signal 
processes, such shifts produce a significant change in 
the output of the signal processing function. For 
example, the discrete Fourier transform computes inner 
products of time data and a complex exponential. If a 
signal is sampled and then resampled at the same rate 
but in such a manner that the second set of samples 
does not line up with the first, then the real, 
imaginary, and phase spectra will be different. As a 
second example, if sampled data is convolved with a  
 
digital matched finite impulse response filter, and is 
then resampled at the same rate but arbitrarily 
shifted, then the output of the filter will be 
different. The nonrepeatability of shift variance is 
aggravated in processes where sampling is sparse on 
certain scales. An example is the affine discrete 
(especially critically sampled) wavelet transform. 
Figure 2 shows a transient (Fig. 2a) and its wavelet 
decomposition (Figs. 2b, 2c and 2d) before and after a 
shift (Figs. 2e, 2f, 2g, 2h). The decomposition is 
totally different because of a shift of just one 
sample. While the continuous wavelet transform is 
shift invariant, the discrete form is not. Figure 2 
illustrates that the discrete wavelet transform is 
sensitive to the exact positioning of signals in a 
sampled time record. In many cases the discrete 
wavelet transform can yield dramatically different 
coefficients depending on where the transient happens 
to occur in the time record. In practice, the location 
of the signal in the time record is usually unknown and 
completely arbitrary. Thus, the discrete wavelet 
transform (used in digital signal processing) is 
unreliable in its ability to detect, characterize and 
classify signals. The shift variance problem will now be 
discussed in more detail. For some processes, a shift 
of an integer number of
