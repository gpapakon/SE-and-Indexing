<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with new chemical compounds, their preparation,
pharmaceutical formulations containing them and their use in medicine, particularly the
prophylaxis and treatment of migraine.Receptors which mediate the actions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) have been
identified in mammals in both the periphery and the brain. According to the
classification and nomenclature proposed in a recent article (Bradley etal,
Neuropharmac., 25, 563 (1986)), these receptors may be classified into three main
types, viz. "5-HT1-like", 5-HT2 and 5-HT3. Various classes of compounds have been
proposed as 5-HT agonists or antagonists for therapeutic use, but these have not
always been specific to a particular type of 5-HT receptor. European Patent
Specification 0313397 describes a class of 5-HT agonists which are specific to a
particular type of "5-HT -like" receptor and are effective therapeutic agents for the
treatment of clinical conditions in which a selective agonist for this type of receptor is
indicated. For example, the receptor in question mediates vasoconstriction in the
carotid vascular bed and thereby modifies blood flow therein. The compounds
described in the European specification are therefore beneficial in the treatment or
prophylaxis of conditions wherein vasoconstriction in the carotid vascular bed is
indicated, for example, migraine, a condition associated with excessive dilation of the
carotid vasculature. However, it is within the scope of the earlier application that the
target tissue may be any tissue wherein action is mediated by "5-HT1-like" receptors of
the type referred to above.We have now found a further class of compounds having exceptional "5-HT1-like"
receptor agonism and excellent absorption following oral dosing. These properties
render the compounds particularly useful for certain medical applications, notably the
prophylaxis and treatment of migraine, cluster headache and headache associated with
vascular disorders, hereinafter referred to collectively as "migraine".
According to the first aspect of the present invention, therefore, there is provided a
compound of formula (I) 

wherein
n is an integer of from 0 to 3;W is a group of formula (i), (ii), or (iii)

wherein R is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, X is -O-, -S-, -NH-, or -CH2-, Y is oxygen or
sulphur and the chiral centre * in formula (i) or (ii) is in its (S) or (R) form or is a
mixture thereof in any proportions; andZ is a group of formula (iv), (v), or (vi)

wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from hydrogen
