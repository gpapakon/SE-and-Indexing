<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a numerical method which via discrete-time measurements of the secondary current (is(k)) from a current transformer reconstructs the primary current (ipr(k)) and the secondary current (isr(k)) of a saturated current transformer, which takes place in a block B1 and a method for detecting saturation as well as for detecting when saturation ceases, which takes place in blocks B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 and B7. The output signals of the method are obtained via a block B8 and upon a decision about saturated current transformer, the output signals consist of the reconstructed primary current (ipn(k)) and the reconstructed secondary current (isn(K)) and upon a decision about unsaturated current transformer, the output signals consist of the reconstructed primary current (ipn(k)) and the measured secondary current (is(k)). The invention also relates to a device for carrying out said methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reconstruction of saturated current transformer signalsTECHNICAL FIELDWithin largely all distribution of electric power, monitoring systems for detecting short circuits and other abnormal states are needed. Instrument transformers for measuring current and voltage therefore constitute ' an important and integrated part of control, monitoring and protective devices in most power distribution systems. It is, of course, very important that these measuring devices correctly reproduce the quantities they are designed to measure, both with regard to static and dynamic values. Since both control and monitoring devices and particularly protective devices are nowadays based on instantaneous value measurement, very high demands are placed on good dynamic conformity during the measurements.Due to practical and economic reasons it is not possible to dimension current transformers so as to avoid saturation at all fault current levels. Therefore, during a fault condition a current of such a high value may arise that the current transformer becomes magnetically saturated, whereby the waveform of the delivered current becomes distorted. This leads to considerable problems, especially for current measuring numeral protective relays, since these will then receive false information on which to base the decisions to take action. A typical example is a differential protection device which, when a current transformer saturation occurs, may lead to an external fault being incorrectly detected as an intersyste fault. It is therefore of great importance to be able to detect whether a current transformer has become subjected to such a current that it has become magnetically saturated. The present invention describes a method for reconstructing, during saturation, with the aid of the distorted secondary current, the primary current which causes the saturation. A reconstruction is also performed of the secondary current which would have been obtained unless 

the current transformer had become saturated. The invention also comprises a method for detecting saturation and detecting when the saturation ceases. The invention also comprises a device for carrying out the method.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1 shows an equivalent diagram for a current transformer seen from the secondary side.Figure 2 shows a flow diagram according to the invention.BACKGROUND ART, THE PROBLEMSOne way of reducing the effect of a current transformer saturation is to use some method for detecting saturation. Several such methods exist, which is
