<ABSTRACT>
Both facets of a double faceted blade are simultaneously 
sharpened as the facets are moved across a first pair of planar 

abrasive coated surfaces crossing to form a vertex and to set at a 
total included angle nominally equal to the intended total included 

angle of the edge facet. A guide structure contacts and aligns the 
blade so that the centerline of the blade is positioned at or near 

the bisection of the included angle of the abrasive surfaces. The 
guide structure is one or more rotatable members.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many of the wide variety of knife sharpeners that have
been developed in the past fail to give truly sharp edges or even
consistently good edges because of the lack of good angular control
during the sharpening process. This is particularly true of V
notch type sharpeners intended to sharpen both edge facets
simultaneously. Manual means for sharpening in particular are
unsatisfactory because existing V type sharpeners do not have an
integral control of the angle but depend on the user to hold the
blade "vertically" while sharpening. To develop a really sharp
edge it is critically important that the blades pass over the
abrasive surface stroke after stroke at the same precise angle.
Even very small variations in the angle in successive strokes will
prevent the formation of a truly sharp edge. The finest edges can
be produced only if the angle is consistent stroke to stroke within
1/2 degree. That is of course impossible without a precise means
to guide the blade.Even narrow slots commonly provided for-angle control do
not work since blades are tapered and their thickness varies widely
from the handle to the tip. Thus, where the blade is thinner along
its length than the width of the slot by only a few thousandths of
an inch there is inadequate angular control to develop a truly
sharp edge. If one attempted to design the slot for tight 
conformity to the blade thickness at one point on the blade other
parts of the blade would be too loose or they would be too thick to
get into the slot.The prior art includes sharpeners such as illustrated in
Figure 15 and Figure 16 wherein wheels of hardened metal, ceramic,
or oxides are placed into an overlapping configuration forming a "V
groove" through which the edge of a blade is passed in intimate
contact with the wheels. This type sharpeners depends upon a
scraping action at the edge of the disk to remove metal from blade
and the disk is mounted on a shaft so that fresh "edges" can be
exposed by rotating the disk after each sharpening. In time the
edges of the disk become rounded and the sharpener is ineffective.
They offer no angular control for the blade or at best a slot is
provided as shown in Figure 15 which is substantially wider than
any blade intended to be sharpened. Consequently the angular
control is poor and the disk edges wear rapidly leading to a short
useful life for the sharpener.Another V type sharpener is the common crock stick
sharpener such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,912,885 which
forms a V shaped slot by using a pair of crossed ceramic
