<ABSTRACT>
A quick release apparatus for a bicycle for pulling and fixing a 
drawbar (1) 

having a cam follower (1b) formed at one end thereof. The apparatus 
includes a 

housing (4) for contacting a bicycle frame (F), and a rotary cam (5) 
supported in the 

housing (4) to be rotatable about an axis substantially 
perpendicular to the drawbar (1). 

The rotary cam (5) is rotatable by a cam lever (6) to contact 
the cam follower (1b) to pull 

the drawbar (1) toward the housing (4). The rotary cam (5) and cam 
lever (6) are interconnected 

through a coupling device disposed at one side of the housing. 
The coupling 

device includes a first coupling for restraining a relative rotation between the 
rotary cam (5) and the cam lever (6), and a second coupling for 

restraining 
a relative 

movement in a direction of the axis between the rotary cam (5) and the 
cam lever (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quick release apparatus for use in securing
a bicycle wheel to a front fork or rear fork, or a bicycle seat to a seat tube.
More particularly, the invention relates to a quick release apparatus for a bicycle
including a rotary cam for contacting a cam follower formed on a drawbar to
pull the drawbar, a cam lever for rotating the rotary cam, and a housing for
rotatably supporting the rotary cam.This type of quick release apparatus is described in Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 62-17281, for example. In known apparatus including the one
disclosed in this publication, generally, the rotary cam for pulling the drawbar
and the cam lever for rotating the rotary cam are formed of the same material to
be integral with each other.In actual use, the rotary cam contacts the cam follower formed on the
drawbar to pull the drawbar. Taking strength and wear resistance into account,
the rotary cam and cam lever are usually formed of metal, inter alia steel. In the
known quick release apparatus, therefore, the rotary cam and cam lever are
usually both formed of a ferrous material to be integral with each other.It is often desired to manufacture a quick release apparatus with the rotary
cam formed of a ferrous material but the cam lever having a different length or
shape to suit a different type or grade of bicycle. In such a case, with the cam
lever and rotary cam formed integral with each other, substantially all of the
components except the housing must be manufactured all over again. This
tends to increase manufacturing cost. An example of rotary cam and cam lever formed separate from each other is
known from U.S. Patent No. 4,724,692. In this prior construction, the rotary
cam has a bore extending through a rotational axis thereof, and the cam lever
has a projection formed remote from a handle portion of the lever. This projection
is passed through the bore of the rotary cam to the other end to be retained in
place by a portion of the housing. Thus, both the rotary cam and cam lever
have complicated shapes, which also tend to increase cost. Document US 4,964,287 discloses a quick release apparatus for a bicycle
connecting a wheel to a bicycle frame. A drawbar acting as an axis passes
through a hub and is fixed at one end by a cap nut and at the other end by a
housing. The quick release apparatus comprises a cam received in the cam
follower and a shaft connected to a lever for rotating the cam. The cam and the
shaft are feed in the housing by a retaining collar being fixed

<CLAIMS>
A quick release apparatus for a bicycle for pulling and fixing a drawbar (1)
having a cam follower (1b) formed at one end thereof, said apparatus

comprising:

a housing (4) for substantially contacting a bicycle frame;
a rotary cam (5) supported in said housing (4) to be rotatable about an axis
substantially perpendicular to said drawbar (1), said rotary cam (5) being

rotatable to contact said cam follower (1b) to pull said drawbar (1) toward
said housing (4); and
a cam lever (6) for rotating said rotary cam (5);
said rotary cam (5) and said cam lever (6) are interconnected through
coupling means disposed at one side of said housing (4),
said coupling means including:
a first coupling for restraining a relative rotation between said rotary cam (5)
and said cam lever (6), and
a second coupling of restraining a relative movement in a direction of said
axis between said rotary cam (5) and said cam lever (6);
characterized in that
said rotary cam (5) has a control shank (5a) formed integral therewith and
extending outwardly of said housing (4), and that
said rotary cam (5) includes a large diameter portion (5c) formed on an end
thereof remote from said control shank (5a) to prevent said rotary cam (5)

from falling off said drawbar (1).
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
first coupling includes splines formed on said control shank and said cam

lever to extend substantially parallel to said axis.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
rotary cam includes a small diameter portion (5b) formed adjacent a proximal 

end of said control shank, and said second coupling includes a portion of said
cam lever press fit on said small diameter portion.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said
portion of said cam lever is forged to extend to said small diameter portion to

press fit thereon.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
second coupling comprises a retainer mounted on said control shank.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said
retainer includes a threaded portion formed on a distal end of said control

shank, and a nut mounted on said threaded portion.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
rotary cam has a substantially stepped configuration having outside

diameters successively increasing from said control shank to said large
diameter portion.
A quick release apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
