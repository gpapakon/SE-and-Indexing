<ABSTRACT>
Device for compensating pressure differences between 
the inside and the outside of an insulating glass frame, 

including a closed cylindrical hollow body (14) which is 
arranged, so that its axis is not horizontal, between the 

inside and the outside of an insulating glass frame (11). A 
ball (15) is movable within the body and has such a 

diameter as to be in contact with the wall, so as to fully 
separate the inside into two regions. At least one first 

hole (17) for connection to the outside/inside is located 
in a suitable wall portion affected by the passage of the 

ball, and at least one second hole (19,20) for connection 
to the inside/outside is located on the bottom (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
compensating pressure differences between the inside and
the outside of an insulating glass frame caused by changes
in environmental parameters.It is known that the inside of an insulating glass
frame is usually separated hermetically from the external
environment.A negative consequence thereof is the fact that the
pressures of the air inside and outside the insulating
glass frame are not always balanced.Changes in environmental parameters due to weather
variations in fact lead to changes in the pressure of the
outside air, which becomes higher or lower than the
pressure inside.The inside of the insulating glass frame can thus be
in overpressure or at a negative pressure with respect to
the outside environment.This has the observed effect of deforming the
insulating glass frame so that it swells or becomes
narrower, with evident aesthetically unpleasant visual
effects.The curving of the glass panes in fact changes the
angles of incidence of the light in the various surface
regions, with corresponding effects both on reflection and
transmission.Furthermore, if a Venetian blind is included inside
the insulating glass frame, it is evident that a narrowing
of the space between the panes can cause difficulties in
operation. US-A-1 703 230 discloses a device for compensating
pressure changes in the space between a pair of window
panes, in the form of cylindrical member having holes
disposed at opposite ends thereof, and a ball which is
movably disposed inside the cylindrical member. The ball
engages a seat disposed at the bottom hole in the
cylindrical member in an equilibrium condition, and when a
pressure change occurs between the pair of window panes the
ball is lifted out of the seat to maintain pressure
equilibrium. The ball has a diameter which is considerably
less than the internal diameter of the cylindrical member.A principal aim of the present invention is therefore
to provide a device that can compensate pressure
differences between the inside and the outside of an
insulating glass frame when they exceed preset threshold
values with respect to an initial equilibrium condition.Another important object is to provide a compensating
device that can be installed without difficulty in the
structure of the insulating glass frame.Another important object is to provide a compensating
device that is simple and functional.Another object is to provide a compensating device
that can be manufactured at low cost with conventional
equipment and facilities.According to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device (10;110) arranged in an insulating glass
frame for compensating pressure differences between the

inside and the outside of the insulating glass frame (12)

comprising a closed cylindrical hollow body (14;114) which
is arranged, so that its axis is not horizontal, between

the inside and the outside of the insulating glass frame
(12), a ball (15) or a flat element (115) being movable

within said body, said ball or flat element having such a
diameter as to be in contact with the wall of the body so

as to fully separate the inside of the body into two
regions respectively above and below said ball or flat

element and each of which varies in volume as said ball or
flat element moves inside said body, at least one first

hole (17;117) for communication between the inside of said body
and one of the inside and outside of the insulating glass
