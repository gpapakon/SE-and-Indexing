<CLAIMS>
A protein with thrombin-inhibitory action from 
terrestrial leeches of the genus Haemadipsa with the 

amino-acid sequence Ile-Arg-Phe-Gly-Met-Gly-Lys-vat-Pro-Cys-Pro-Asp-Gly-Glu-Val-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Cys-Asp-Cys-Gly-Glu-Lys-Ile-Cys-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Gln-Ser-Cys-Asn-Asp-Gly-Gln-Cys-Ser-Gly-Asp-Pro-Lys-Pro-Ser-Ser-Glu-Phe-Glu-Glu-Phe-Glu-Ile-Asp-Glu-Glu-Glu-Lys 
(SEQ ID NO: 1) or an amino-acid 

sequence which is obtained by C-terminal truncation of 
SEQ ID NO: 1 by from one to twelve amino acids. 
A protein as claimed in claim 1 with the sequence 
SEQ ID NO: 2. 
A DNA sequence which codes for a protein with 
thrombin-inhibitory action and which is selected from the 

group comprising 

a) DNA sequences of the structure described in 
SEQ ID NO: 22, 
b) DNA sequences which code for proteins as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, and 
c) DNA sequences which hybridize under standard conditions 
with DNA sequences a) or b). 
An expression vector which contains a DNA 
sequence as claimed in claim 3. 
The use of proteins which are encoded by DNA 
sequences as claimed in claim 3 for producing drugs for 

controlling diseases. 
A drug containing one or more proteins which are 
encoded by DNA sequences as claimed in claim 3, and 

another coagulation-inhibiting factor. 
A drug as claimed in claim 6, wherein a hirudin 
is used as another coagulation-inhibiting factor.
