<ABSTRACT>
An antacid composition comprises, as antacid 
ingredients, a hydrotalcite and dihydroxyaluminium 

aminoacetate in such a ratio that the former/the latter 
equals 30/70 to 90/10 (by weight). The composition may 

further comprise a readily acting or rapid effecting 
antacid ingredient such as a magnesium hydroxide in an 

amount of 10 to 50% by weight. The antacid composition 
is improved in antacid properties and rapid effecting 

properties, and is useful as a pharmaceutical composition 
comprising the antacid composition, a carrier, an 

additive, an additional pharmaceutically active ingredient 
and so on. The total amount of the antacid 

ingredients in the pharmaceutical composition may be 
10% by weight or more. The pharmaceutical composition 

may be formed into a fine granule or a granule with 
utilizing granulation, or into a tablet by compression-mold
ing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antacid composition, 
particularly an antacid composition which shows 
no effect on a patient in hypoacidity or anacidity, and 
gives a fast or ready effect on a patient in hyperacidity 
or hyperchylia, and to a pharmaceutical composition 
comprising the antacid composition. Heart burn (pyrosis), sysphoria after meal, flatulent 
feeling have been considered to be mainly caused 
by hyperacidity or hyperchylia. Recently, however, it 
is reported that similar symptoms are appeared in case 
of hypoacidity or anacidity. Patients in hypoacidity 
or anacidity may frequently take a general gastrointestinal 
or gastroenteric drug or an antacid, on concluding 
only by subjective symptoms or signs. In such a 
case, however, the symptoms may rather take the turn 
for the worse. Therefore, it is preferable to show no 
effect on patients in hypoacidity and in anacidity, 
and to give effects only on patients in hyperacidity or 
hyperchylia. With regard to antacids suitable for such 
objects, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 101520/1975 (JP-A-50-101520) discloses a  
 
method of coating an antacid ingredient with a coating 
composition which dissolves at pH 5 - 6 or less, and 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 210012/1984 
(JP-A-59-210012) discloses an antacid coated with a 
coating composition which is soluble only in acidic 
region. In these antacids, however, polymers used as the 
coating compositions, for instance, polyvinylacetal 
diethylaminoacetate [AEA (trade name), manufactured by 
Sankyo, Co., Ltd., Japan] and a dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate-methacrylate 
copolymer [Eudragit E (trade 
name), manufactured by Röhm Pharma GmbH, Germany] are 
expensive. Further, an organic solvent (for example, 
alcohols, acetone, methylene chloride and the like) 
employed for coating with the coating composition 
causes some problems such as safety and remaining of 
the organic solvent. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide an antacid composition and a pharmaceutical 
composition which can dissolve in an acidic 
region to neutralize gastric acid and can suppress the 
pH increase in a neutral region, without a coating 
polymer and an organic solvent. It is another object of the invention to provide  
 
an antacid composition and a pharmaceutical composition 
which can rapidly or readily adjust the pH to a neutral 
region by a simple composition. A yet another object of the invention is to provide 
an antacid composition and a
