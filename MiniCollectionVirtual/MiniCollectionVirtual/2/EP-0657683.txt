<ABSTRACT>
A flexible vibration-damping joint (1) wherein a metal 
bellows sleeve (6) with undulations (7) for rendering it 

elastically deformable is covered externally with a 
braided wire sheath (8) and connected at opposite ends to 

respective rigid, tubular end pieces (4,5) fittable to the 
pipe portions (2,3) for connection; and at least one annular 

vibration-damping pad (16) made of compressed wire is 
inserted between the bellows sleeve (6) and the braided wire 

sheath (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible
vibration-damping joint for connecting pipe portions in
fluidtight, mechanically "decoupled" manner, and
fittable in particular to the exhaust pipe of an
internal combustion engine vehicle, for connecting the
end pipe portion of the exhaust manifold of the engine
to the inlet pipe portion of the catalyst.Here and hereinafter, the term "mechanically
decoupled" is intended to mean the ability of the joint
to mechanically connect two end-to-end pipe portions
without transmitting any noticeable vibration between
them, and in particular in such a manner as to protect
the catalyst against vibration of the engine, while at
the same time permitting relative axial and torsional
movement of the connected pipe portions as a
consequence, for example, of differing thermal
expansion.Numerous types of flexible joints are known for
fluidtight connecting two portions of a vehicle exhaust 
pipe. One type features, like in e.g. US-A-4,659,117, a flexible undulated fluidtight
connecting sleeve, and supporting parts fittable to the
ends of the pipe portions so as to grip one another and
form box type pockets housing vibration-damping pads
made of compressed wire known as wire mesh. Another
known type (see e.g. EP-A-0 511 000) consists simply of a flexible undulated
sleeve with a flexible braided wire outer sheath, both
fitted in fluidtight manner to two rigid tubular end
pieces in turn fitted to the pipe portions for
connection.The first type provides for good connection and
good mechanical "decoupling" of the pipe portions, but
is complex in design, relatively bulky, and expensive to
produce; whereas the second is compact and cheap to
produce, but provides for only a limited amount of
vibration damping, all of which depends on the
elasticity of the undulated sleeve.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a flexible vibration-damping joint for
fluidtight connecting two end-to-end pipe portions, and
which at the same time is compact, cheap to produce, and
provides for a good degree of vibration damping
efficiency.According to the present invention, there is
provided a flexible vibration-damping joint for
mechanical, fluidtight connection of two pipe portions,
as claimed in claim 1. According to a first embodiment, the
vibration-damping pad is in the form of a cylindrical
sleeve of such a length as to cooperate with all or at
least some of the undulations of the bellows sleeve.According to a second embodiment, the
vibration-damping pad is in the form of an annular
element

<CLAIMS>
A flexible vibration-damping joint (1;101;102;103;104) for
mechanical, fluidtight connection of two pipe portions, in particular two

portions (2,3) of a vehicle exhaust pipe; the joint comprising: a pair of
substantially rigid, tubular end pieces (4,5) fittable to respective opposite facing

ends of the pipe portions (2,3); a metal bellows sleeve (6) presenting a number
of undulations (7) for rendering it elastically deformable, and the opposite ends

(9,10) of which are connected integral with respective said end pieces (4,5); a
braided wire sheath (8) externally covering the bellows sleeve (6) and also

connected at opposite ends (11,12) to said end pieces (4,5); and at least one
annular pad (16;161;163) made of compressed wire; 
characterized in that

said annular pad (16;161;163) is inserted between the bellows sleeve (6) and the
braided wire sheath (8), gripped in direct contact between the latter and at least

one of the undulations (7) of the bellows sleeve (6) or at least with the peak
(17) thereof, so as to act effectively as a vibration-damping element.
A flexible joint (1) as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that it
comprises a vibration-damping pad (16) in the form of a cylindrical sleeve of

such a length as to cooperate with at least some of the undulations (7) of the
bellows sleeve (6). 
A flexible joint (101;102) as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that
it comprises at least one vibration-damping pad (161) in the form of an annular

element conjugate with the contour of the undulations (7) of the bellows sleeve
(6) and inserted in the annular gap between at least any two adjacent

undulations (7) so as to cooperate on either side with the same.
A flexible joint (103;104) as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that it comprises a vibration-damping pad (163) in the form of an annular

element fitted to a cylindrical, smaller-diameter, nonundulated portion (62) of
the bellows sleeve (6); said pad (163) being gripped between an end undulation

(7
a
) of the bellows sleeve (6) and an annular shoulder (21) on the corresponding

end piece (4,5), so as to grip against said shoulder (21) a corresponding portion
of the end portion (11,12) of the braided wire sheath (8).
A flexible joint (104) as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that said
vibration-damping pad (163) in the form of an annular element is gripped

externally, with the braided wire sheath (8) in between, by an annular sleeve
portion (30) ofthe corresponding end piece (4,5).
A flexible joint as claimed in any one of the foregoing Claims,
characterized in that each said end piece (4,5) comprises a cylindrical tube

portion (20) for connection to a respective said pipe portion (2,3); and an axial
shoulder (21) formed by permanently deforming a respective annular portion of

said cylindrical tube portion (20).
A flexible joint as claimed in Claim 6, characterizec in that each said 
end piece (4,5) presents an annular portion (30;301) superimposed on the

corresponding end (11,12) of the braided wire sheath (8).
A flexible joint as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that said
annular portion (30) of the end piece (4,5) superimposed on the braided wire

sheath (8) is defined by an annular sleeve portion of the end piece larger in
diameter than the bellows sleeve (6), and is connected to the corresponding said

axial shoulder (21) ofthe end piece (4,5) by means of a weld bead (32).
