<ABSTRACT>
In this process, the hot raw gas is quenched with a part stream of the gas from which dust has not been removed and which is withdrawn at a temperature of between 200 and 800@C from the convection section of the waste-heat boiler system located downstream of the gasification reactor. The quench gas is in this case recycled by means of an injector into the quench zone located downstream of the gasification reactor.

A process for cooling crude gas from gasification reactor operated with fine particulate to
dust-like fuels, wherein the crude gas, which is taken off from the gasification reactor at a

temperature above the slag melting point, is cooled in a waste heat boiler arrangement comprising
a radiation cooling device and a downstream convection cooling device, the cooled gas is dedusted

in a downstream gas cleaning stage, a partial stream is taken off from the convection
cooling device, at a temperature between 200 and 800째C and upstream of the de-dusting stage,

and is recycled as a quench gas, by means of an injector which is acted upon by propellant gas,
to a quenching zone of the waste heat boiler arrangement, and a partial stream of the product gas

which is taken offdownstream ofthe gas cleaning stage is compressed by means of a compressor
and is used as the propellant gas.

to a quenching zone of the waste heat boiler arrangement, and an external gas which is under

pressure, preferably nitrogen, steam or methane, is used the propellant gas.
A process according to any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the quench gas is recycled to the 
waste heat boiler arrangement upstream of the radiation cooling device, and the amount of quench

gas is designed so that an average gas temperature of 900 to 1400째C is obtained as the mixture
temperature.
A process according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the quench gas is recycled to the waste heat
boiler arrangement downstream of the radiation cooling device, and the amount of quench gas is

designed so that an average gas temperature of 700 to 1200째C is obtained as the mixture
temperature.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein an injector is used which
comprises an abrasion-resistant lining, such as fused basalt or sintered metal for example.
