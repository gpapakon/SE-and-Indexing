<ABSTRACT>
The object is to minimise the dynamic spring stiffness of an elastomeric support, in particular an engine support in motor vehicles, for particular frequencies. According to the invention, a main spring (4) supporting the main mass (1) has connected in parallel with it an absorber mass (2) which is connected to the main mass (1) by way of a first absorber spring (6) and to the supporting foundation (5) by way of a second absorber spring (7).
