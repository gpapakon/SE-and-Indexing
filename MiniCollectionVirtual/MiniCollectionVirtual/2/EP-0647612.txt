<DESCRIPTION>
Weeds cause tremendous global economic losses 
by reducing crop yields and lowering crop quality. In 
the United States alone, agronomic crops must compete 
with hundreds of weed species. In spite of the commercial herbicides available 
today, damage to crops caused by weeds still 
occurs. Accordingly, there is ongoing research to create 
new and more effective herbicides. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide compounds which are highly effective for controlling 
undesirable plant species. It is also an object of the present invention 
to provide a method for controlling undesirable plant 
species. These and other objects of the present invention 
will become more apparent from the detailed description 
thereof set forth below.  The present invention describes aryloxybenzene 
compounds which are useful as herbicidal agents. The aryloxybenzene compounds of the present 
invention have the following structural formula I:

Ar isM isN or CZ; X, Y and Z areeach independently hydrogen, halogen, 
C₁-C₄alkyl, C₁-C₄haloalkyl, C₁-C₄haloalkoxy,

and Z cannot simultaneously be nitro; p isan integer of 0, 1 or 2; R₇ isC₁-C₄alkyl or C₁-C₄haloalkyl; R₆ isC₁-C₄alkyl; W and W₁ areeach independently O, S or NR₈; R₈ ishydrogen or C₁-C₄alkyl; m isan integer of 0 or 1; R isnitro, halogen, cyano, C₁-C₄alkylsulfonyl or
