<DESCRIPTION>
Method of intraoperativelv detecting and locating i 
The invention relates to a method of intraoperativt; / detecting and locating tumoura tissues in the body of a warm-blooded living being, to a method of radioguide surgery of said being, and to a radiopharmaceutical composition to be used for th latter method. The invention further relates to a labelled peptide compound to b used in said composition and to a kit for preparing said composition.The accurate staging of tumours, in particular malignant tumours, in general remain one of the most important clinical challenges. Often such tumours or thei me astases are extremely small «1 cm), and because of this small size they are no readily detectable and distinguishable using conventional imaging techniques. Even the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as SPECT acquisition techniques, in combination with tumour-selective imaging agents, is frequently unable to show all lesions, because of disturbing background activity that makes accurate image interpretation difficult. Especially in the abdominal area it is often difficult t distinguish benign for malignant tissues using conventional imaging methods. An example of such a subgroup of tumours are gastro-enteropancreatic tumours that produce hormones, which result in sometimes life-threatening symptoms, e.g. massive diarrhea. The obvious therapy in these cases is to surgically remove thes tumours. However, their often small size makes imaging techniques not reliable i accurately locating the lesion, while the surgeon is simply not capable of finding th tumours quickly and, moreover, is in fact not sure that aJi lesions are operativel removed.A relatively new technique provides surgical aid: a gamma detecting probe, e.g. Neoprobeζ that can be used to detect sources of gamma radiation that are ver small. After parenteral administration of a radiolabelled substance, the surgeon can intraoperatively, use this probe to find the lesions in which uptake of this substanc has taken place. E.W. Martin and coworkers have investigated this new technique e.g. Amer. J. Surgery 1^6, 1988, 386-392; Antibody Immunocon. Radiopharm. 4 1991 , 339-358. These investigators have observed that antibodies or antibod fragments, labelled with iodine-125, a low-energy gamma photon emittor, ar promising substances to be used in this technique. They indicate that this techniqu may successfully target 80% of colorectal cancer and detect occult tumours in th abdomen in 20% of the surgical cases involving cancer of the colon. Although
