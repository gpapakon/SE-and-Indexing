<DESCRIPTION>
 ETHODS OF HOLOGRAM CONSTRUCTION USING COMPUTER-PROCESSED OBJECTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Classical holograms are most commonly created by recording the complex diffraction pattern of laser light reflected from a physical object. These holograms can reconstruct images of sub-micron detail with superb quality. Ever since the early days of holography, there has been considerable interest in forming holograms of computer generated objects by computing and recording their diffraction patterns. These holograms are usually referred to as computer generated holograms, or CGH's. The computational task is a formidable one because of the enormity of the data required for good imagery. For example, a typical 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter hologram can resolve more than 101A image points. Furthermore, no portion of the hologram surface pattern can be completely calculated until the diffraction transformation has been carried out on every one of these resolvable points. This necessitates the use of a rather large active memory; 1010 bytes for our hypothetical 10x10 centimeter hologram.Even more problematic is the requirement that, for viewing over a reasonable angle, this information must be deposited into the hologram surface at a density of less than 1 pixel per micron and with about 24 bits of intensity per pixel. Many schemes have been developed for recording in a binary fashion, a process which further reduces the required pixel size.Holograms can be composed from a multiplicity of independent object view, as was discussed in a paper by King, et al, published in Applied Optics. in 1970, entitled "A New Approach to Computer-Generated 

 Holograms." These holograms are the type discussed in this disclosure wherein they are referred to as â€¢composite1 holograms. A rather elementary but effective technique for creating composite holograms with computer generated images borrows holographic technology which was developed for other media; most notably cinematography film of physical objects. This process is discussed in a patent by K. Haines which issued in July 1982 as U.S. patent 4,339,168. In a common embodiment of this method, many conventional views of an object are collected along a simple linear or circular trajectory. Each of these views is then processed in an optical system to build up portions of a first or storage hologram (sometimes referred to as an hi) . This storage hologram bears some similarity to the drum multiplex holograms, examples of which contain fully rendered computer images.The image from
