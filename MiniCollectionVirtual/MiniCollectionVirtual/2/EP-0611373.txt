5' end and 3' end and are composed of 6 to 100 
nucleotide building blocks, by a process of 

oligonucleotide synthesis in which a start 
nucleoside is bound to a solid support and 

subsequently the desired oligonucleotide is 
synthesized by stepwise coupling with appropriately

desired trivalent phosphorus is oxidized to 
pentavalent phosphorus during and after the 

synthesis, the oligonucleotide is cleaved from the

a process of oligonucleotide synthesis, in which a 
start nucleoside i
s bound to a solid support and
