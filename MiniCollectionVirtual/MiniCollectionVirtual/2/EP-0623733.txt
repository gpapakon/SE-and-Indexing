<ABSTRACT>
A scroll machine designed to provide an unbalanced loading of the orbiting scroll 
and anti-rotation coupling in a direction which adds to the moment caused by contact 

forces between the scroll wraps during normal operation. The loading decreases the 
sound level of the machine and is achieved through the use of unbalanced flank gas 

leakage forces and flank contact forces, which are created by providing a targeted initial 
swing radius bias and/or a generating radius bias to either one or both of the scroll 

wraps. The generating radius biasing can be singular or plural on a given scroll wrap set. 
A number of different techniques for obtaining such biasing are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to scroll machines and more particularly to a novel method
and apparatus for attenuating noise in such machines which utilize an Oldham coupling
or equivalent device to prevent relative rotation of the scroll members.Although the present invention is believed to be applicable to different types of
scroll machines it is disclosed herein embodied in a refrigerant compressor for use in air
conditioning, heat pump and refrigerating systems, such as that disclosed in applicants'
assignee's U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,102,316, the disclosure of which is hereby
incorporated herein by reference.In the marketplace there is an increasing demand for much quieter machinery than
was hitherto acceptable, and this is especially true in the case of air conditioning and heat
pump systems. There are a number of identified sources of sound in a scroll
compressor, many of which are relatively easily cured. A recently discovered source of
sound which does not lend itself to easy cure, however, concerns the mechanical impact
noise or rattle which is caused by vibration of the orbiting scroll member and Oldham
coupling under certain operating conditions, i.e., under lighter load conditions when there
is insufficient loading of the orbiting scroll and Oldham coupling to prevent force reversals
which can cause the keys on the Oldham coupling to impact noisily on the sides of the
slots in which they are disposed. A scroll machine apparatus incorporating
an oldham coupling is disclosed in EP-A-0 479 412 upon
which the preambles of independent claims 1, 17, 19, 21 are based. Even though scroll compressors have been in commercial production for many
years now, it has been observed that some compressors are significantly more quiet than
others. In studying this phenomenon it has been determined that the variance in the
noise in question is in large part due to the variance in physical dimensions resulting from
the difficulty in closely controlling manufacturing tolerances to a precise degree. The
problem has been compounded by a lack of understanding of exactly what specific
dimensions and tolerances are in fact critical to noise attenuation in such a machine.Conventional wisdom dictates that each of the mating scroll wraps has a true
involute profile which is generated from the exact same size and shape generating
element and the same initial swing radius. In other words, there should be zero
generating radius bias and zero initial swing radius bias. In addition, the mating scroll
wraps should be arranged at
