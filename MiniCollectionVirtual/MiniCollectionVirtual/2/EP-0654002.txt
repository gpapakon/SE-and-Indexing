<ABSTRACT>
A package for air and/or humidity sensitive pourable materials and a process for filling and emptying the same are disclosed. The package is designed with an additional round plate, so as not to dirty the filling and emptying devices, and to reduce the waste to be disposed of, or to make the reuse of materials easier thanks to the use of uniform packaging materials.

A pack for adhesives and/or sealants containing a 
drum-like transport container (9) and a bag-like inner pack 

(2) of composite film, characterized by a cover disk (12) 
with a central hole (13) and a film-like disk (3) of a 

composite film, the cover disk (12) being disposed between 
the lid (11) of the transport container (9) and the surface 

of the inner pack (2), the film-like disk (3) having a 
central hole and a larger diameter than the transport 

container (9) and being arranged between the adhesive/sealant 
and the folded layers (8) of the open end of the 

inner pack (2) in the filled state thereof. 
A pack for adhesives and/or sealants containing a 
drum-like temporary container (1) and a bag-like inner pack 

(2) of composite film, the temporary container (1) being 
provided to transfer the filled inner pack (2) to a drum-like 

transport container (9), characterized by a film-like 
disk (3) of a composite film which has a central hole and 

a larger diameter than the temporary container (1), the 
film-like disk (3) being arranged between the adhesive/sealant 

and the folded layers (8) of the open end of the 
inner pack (2) in the filled state thereof. 
A pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the inner pack (2) has a flat base. 
A pack as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the inner pack (2) and the disk (3) consist of a 

three-layer composite film, the inner pack and the disk 
preferably consisting of the same composite film. 
A pack as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the three-layer composite film consists of two polymer 

layers with a metal layer in between. 
A pack as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the polymer layers are polyolefin layers and the metal 

layer is an aluminium layer. 
A pack as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that  
 

polyethylene and/or polypropylene is used as the polyolefin. 
A pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the composite film consists of more than three layers 

and at least one of the middle layers is a metal layer. 
A pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the more than two polymer layers of the composite film 

consist of polyamide and/or polyester. 
A pack as claimed in claim 1 or 3, characterized in 
that the cover disk (12) consists of cardboard. 
A method of filling the pack claimed in at least one 
of claims 1 to 10 using a pressure follower plate (4), 

characterized in that the pressure follower plate (4) is 
covered by the disk (3), the adhesive/sealant is first 

introduced into an inner pack (2) inserted into a temporary 
container (1), after which the disk (3) is separated from 

the pressure follower plate (4), the inner pack (2) is 
closed at its upper end above the disk (3) and is then 

introduced into a drum-like transport container (9) and, at 
the same time, turned through 180Â° so that the filling 

opening of the inner pack is at the bottom of the transport 
container (9) and the upper end of the inner pack (2) is 

provided with a flat cover disk (12). 
A method of emptying the pack claimed in at least one 
of claims 1 to
 10 using an optionally heated pressure follower 
plate (4), characterized in that the inner pack (2) 

is locally opened (14) at its upper end by means of the 
cover disk (2) as a template, after which the pressure 

follower plate (4) is applied to the cover disk (12) lying 
on top of the inner pack (2). 
The use of the pack claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 10 for packing reactive adhesives and/or sealants.
