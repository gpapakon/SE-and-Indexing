<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring the moisture content of 
an absorbent material, for example the paper insulation 

in an electrical transformer, uses a back scattered 
radiation technique to determine the absorption of light 

at specific wavelengths. A ratio of the back scattered 
radiation at different wavelengths can be compared 

against known values corresponding to a specific moisture 
content. An optical waveguide such as a bifurcated 

optical fibre is provided with a probe end optically 
coupled to a source end and a detection end, for 

transmitting light to the absorbent material and 
transmitting back scattered radiation to a detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and device 
for measuring moisture content of an absorbent material 
which is not easily accessible for measurements. In 
particular, this invention relates to a method and device 
for measuring the moisture content of paper insulation 
used in electrical transformers filled with mineral oil 
or synthetic fluids. High voltage transformers contain paper 
insulated conductors immersed in an oil-filled tank. 
During the manufacturing process, the moisture content of 
the paper insulation is reduced to less than 0.5 percent. 
However, as a transformer ages, the moisture content of 
the paper may gradually increase as moisture slowly 
diffuses from the atmosphere into the oil, and then into 
the paper insulation. Excessive moisture content in 
paper insulation quickly deteriorates its insulating 
ability, reducing the electrical resistance of the 
insulation and promoting local heating and surface 
tracking under operating electrical stress. Moreover, under thermal stress as experienced 
either during normal operation or during emergency 
overloading of a transformer, excess water molecules may 
be converted into free gas bubbles, which under 
electrical stress will produce partial discharges that 
gradually degrade the oil-paper insulation. Free water 
molecules are generated when the paper insulation 
degrades, resulting in a vicious cycle: an increase in 
the moisture content of the paper above about 2 percent 
can lead to additional local overheating, gassing, 
increased partial discharge activity, more water 
generation, and eventually run away loss in the integrity 
of the insulation system resulting in a premature failure 
of the equipment.  During manufacturing, a dissipation factor at 60 
Hz of the overall insulation system, either between the 
primary and secondary windings of the transformer or 
between a winding and the tank, is used to determine the 
"dryness" of insulation. For transformers in service, 
the moisture content in the paper insulation is estimated 
through measurement of the water content of the 
transformer oil. However, in both cases the moisture 
content of the paper insulation cannot be known exactly. 
Until the present invention there were no practical 
methods available for direct on-site measurement of 
moisture content of the paper insulation in transformers. The present invention provides a method and 
device for directly measuring the moisture content of 
paper insulation in electrical transformers. The 
invention can be used to control
