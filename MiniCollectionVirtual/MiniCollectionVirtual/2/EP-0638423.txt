<ABSTRACT>
In a transfer type ink jet recording system, a scanning is 
conducted on a transfer drum using a recording head (2) to form 

ink dot strings. The recording head (2) is moved in one 
subscanning direction with a fixed pitch so that ink drops are 

impacted to positions which are not adjacent to ink dot strings 
formed immediately before the current scanning step, whereby 

a repellent phenomenon is prevented from occurring. According 
to another aspect of the invention, the printing sequence is 

changed in accordance with the density of print data. A dot 
counter (153) counts the number of printing dots of each 
of a 
plurality of writing blocks in a video memory (152). A 

controller (130) decides the sequence of printing the printing 
blocks on the basis of the result, and transfers information 

indicative of the sequence of the printing block to a memory 
selector. In deciding the sequence, restriction is set so that 

adjacent blocks are not successively subjected to the printing 
step. The memory selector (154) reads out printing data from a 

video memory (152) on the basis of the sequence information, 
and transfers the data to a recording head (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink jet recording method 
especially of a transfer type in which an ink 
image is formed on a transfer medium and then 
transferred to a recording medium to thereby obtain 
an ink image on the recording medium. A transfer type ink jet printer has the 
advantage that ink jet nozzles are free from 
clogging due to unintended contacts between a 
recording head and a recording sheet or due to 
paper dust. This advantage assures high 
reliability. Such transfer type ink jet printers 
are disclosed in US-A-4,538,156 and 5,099,256. In the disclosed apparatuses, an ink jet 
recording head (hereinafter, referred to as a 
recording head) having a plurality of nozzles is 
separated from a cylindrical transfer medium by a 
gap. When an ink image is to be formed on the 
transfer medium by the recording head, the 
recording head forms an ink image on the cylinder 
in accordance with an image signal in 
synchronization with the rotation of the 
cylindrical transfer medium, while the recording 
head moves in a direction parallel to the direction 
in which the nozzles are arranged. Then a 
recording medium is brought into contact with the 
transfer medium and pressed from the back against 
the transfer medium, whereby the ink image is 
transferred to the recording medium. Thereafter,  
 
the recording medium is discharged from the 
apparatus. In another known method (Japanese Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. HEI4-169,236), in order to 
dry and fix a recorded ink image to improve the 
printing quality, the total number of printed dots 
or the density of printed dots is counted, and a 
drying heater is controlled in accordance with the 
counted value. In any of the above apparatuses, the transfer 
step must be conducted at a low pressure to ensure 
high efficiency and complete transfer of the image. 
Specifically, the step of transferring an ink image 
from a transfer medium to a recording sheet is 
conducted by applying a pressure, and therefore the 
transfer medium must be made of a material from 
which the ink image is easily peeled or which has 
a low surface energy. On the other hand, the ink 
image on the transfer medium is formed by dots 
produced by ink drops ejected from the recording 
head. Because of surface tension, such dots have 
a tendency to gather on a material having a low 
surface energy. Therefore, plural dots aggregate 
on the transfer medium to form a large dot. As a 
result, a dot may be formed at a position different 
from where the dot should be formed, or an ink 
image

An ink jet recording method in which an ink image is 
written on a transfer medium (1) by a recording head, (12) 

and transferred to a recording medium (15), said recording 
head (2) being opposed to said transfer medium (1) and 

separated therefrom by a gap, and a main scanning and a 
subscanning are conducted on said transfer medium, wherein 

an ink image writing step is conducted by selectively 
ejecting ink drops from said recording head, said ink image 

writing step comprising: 

a) a first scanning step in which ink dot strings are 
formed in a main scanning direction so as not to adjoin 

each other in at least a subscanning direction;
