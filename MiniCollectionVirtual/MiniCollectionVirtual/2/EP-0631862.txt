<ABSTRACT>
Shaped thermoplastic composite panels for 
aircraft interiors are provided having a lofted 

structure and containing reinforcing glass fibers 
and a thermoplastic resin matrix employing resins 

that have high glass transition temperatures. The 
panels are prepared by a process involving forming 

a dilute aqueous slurry of polymer particulates and 
reinforcing glass fibers, collecting the polymer 

particulates and glass fibers in the form of a 
continuous mat by dewatering the slurry over a 

porous support, drying the mat to remove residual 
water from the mat, consolidating the mat under 

pressure at an elevated temperature, low pressure 
match molding of the mat at an elevated temperature 

to create a solid, lofted shaped panel, and cooling 
the shaped panel in the mold. The panels are 

lofted to provide sound insulation and absorption, 
resistance to fire penetration, reduced flame 

spread and low smoke generation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic 
composite panels for aircraft interiors, and more 
particularly relates to thermoplastic composite 
aircraft panels for aircraft interiors wherein the 
panels have a thermoplastic resin matrix and lofted 
glass reinforcing fibers. Aircraft interior panels made from heat 
resistant thermoplastic materials such as 
polyetherimide resin or polyether ether ketone 
resin are well known. Such resins are typically 
used because of their heat resistance and inherent 
flame resistant characteristics. There is however, 
a strong interest in finding aircraft interior 
panels which exhibit improved sound absorption 
characteristics, fire penetration resistance, 
reduced levels of flame spread, and reduced levels 
of smoke generation. This invention provides shaped thermoplastic 
composite panels for aircraft interiors. The 
panels contain reinforcing glass fibers and a heat 
resistant thermoplastic resin. The panels have a 
lofted structure having a relatively low density. 
The panels are made by a process involving forming 
a dilute aqueous slurry of the thermoplastic resin 
in particulate form and the reinforcing glass 
fibers, collecting the resin particulates and glass 
fibers in the form of a continuous mat by 
dewatering the slurry over a foraminous support, 
drying the mat to remove residual water from the  
 
mat, consolidation of the mat in a flat hot press 
to force air out of the mat and to cause the resin 
to flow onto the fibers and low pressure match mold 
shaping of the mat at elevated temperatures, to 
allow the fibers to loft, followed by cooling to 
create a lofted shaped panel. The panels will 
exhibit high levels of sound absorption, resistance 
to fire penetration and flame spread, and low smoke 
generation. Figure 1 is a top plan view of a panel (10) 
made pursuant to the present invention; Figure 2 is a side elevation cross sectional 
view of the panel of Figure 1 along lines 2-2; Figure 3 is a top plan view of a shaped panel 
(10') made pursuant to the present invention; and Figure 4 is a side elevational cross sectional 
view of the panel (10') of figure 3 along lines 4-4. The shaped thermoplastic composite panels of 
this invention have (a) reinforcing glass fibers 
present at a level of from 30% to 60% by weight 
based on the total weight of the panel, wherein the 
fibers have lengths selected from between 0.10 inch 
and 2.0 inches, and (b) thermoplastic resin present 
at a level of from 40% to 70% by weight based on 
the total weight of the
