<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for sealing off vehicle side-windows from a vehicle folding top, in particular in cabriolets, with lateral, rigid roof-frame parts, extending in the longitudinal direction, as part of the foldable folding-top linkage. In order to compensate for tolerances with regard to the sealing-off of the windows, provision is made, according to the invention, for angular window-guiding profiles (5) with sealing lips (13, 14, 15) resting on the window pane (6), and a laterally protruding sealing lip (33) to be screwed onto the outsides of the roof-frame parts (1) in a manner which allows them to be adjusted vertically, longitudinally and laterally with respect to the folding top (34).

A system for sealing vehicle side windows (6) from a 
convertible top (34), more particularly for covertibles, 

including side rigid roof frame parts (1) oriented in the 
side wall plane as part of the folding top linkage (1, 2, 

3), whereby window guide profiles (5) having sealing lips 
(13, 14, 15) adjoining the window (6) being arranged at 

the outer sides of said roof frame parts (1),
 
characterized in that said window guide profiles (5) are 

formed angularly and are screwed to the outer sides of 
said roof frame parts (1) adjustable in height, length and 

lateral spacing. 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 1,
 
characterized in that said window guide profile (5) is 

made of an approximate U-shaped basic profile of an 
elastomeric material with two protruding legs (7, 8) 

featuring a metallic reinforcement (9), said profile base 
(20) oriented parallel to said roof frame parts (1) 

comprising penetrations (21) located roughly at half 
height and coincident tappings (23) in said roof frame 

parts (1) into which fastener screws (24) are screwed from 
the profile side. 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2,
 
characterized in that said penetrations (21) having a 

diameter which is larger than said diameter of said 
threaded shank (22) of said fastener screws (24).  

 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2 and 3,
 
characterized in that a washer (25) is inserted between 

said screw head (24) and said profile base (20). 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2,
 
characterized in that at least one washer (30) is inserted 

between said profile base (20) and said roof frame parts 
(1). 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 5,
 
characterized in that said washers (30) are expediently 

configured approximate horse-shoe shaped with a curvature 
following the contour of said roof frame parts (1) in the 

base region and with a free spacing of said two legs (31, 
32) amounting to at least the diameter of said threaded 

shank (22) of said fastener screws (24). 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2,
 
characterized in that said fastener screws (24) comprise a 

hexagon socket (26) at the thread end. 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2,
 
characterized in that at least one of said free legs (7, 

8) of said basic profile (5) is expediently downswept (11, 
12) inclined inwardly at its end, and a sealing lip (13, 

14) facing said window (6) is extruded in place at each 
leg end. 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 2,
 
characterized in that a further sealing lip (15) may face 

the window top edge (6) at said inner side of said upper 
leg (7).  

 
The sealing system as set forth in claim 8 and 9,
 
characterized in that a sealing lip (33) extruded in place 

against said side inner edge of said convertible top (34) 
being provided parallel to said downswept region (11) of 

said profile leg (7).
