<DESCRIPTION>
The use of naturally occurring estrogenic compositions of substantial purity
and low toxicity such as Premarin® has become a preferred medical treatment for
alleviating the symptoms of menopausal syndrome, osteoporosis/osteopenia in
estrogen deficient women and in other hormone related disorders. The estrogenic
components of the naturally occurring estrogenic compositions have been generally
identified as sulfate esters of estrone, equilin, equilenin, β-estradiol,
dihydroequilenin and β-dihydroequilenin (U.S. 2,834,712). The estrogenic
compositions are usually buffered or stabilized with alkali metal salts of organic or
inorganic acids at a substantially neutral pH of about 6.5 to 7.5. Urea has also been
used as a stabilizer (U.S. 3,608,077). The incorporation of antioxidants to stabilize
synthetic conjugated estrogens and the failure of pH control with Tris® to prevent
hydrolysis is discussed in U.S. 4,154,820.8,9-Dehydroestrone is a known compound useful as an intermediate in the
synthetic production of estrone by isomerization to 9,11 unsaturation (U.S.
3,394,153) and as an intermediate in the production of 3-cyclopentyloxy-17-ethynyl
derivatives (Example XXVIII, U.S. 3,649,621). In addition, 8,9-dehydroestrone
is known to possess estrogenic activity and to lower blood lipid
levels (Examples 11 and 12; US 3,391,169).In accordance with this invention there is provided a group of
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of 8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate ester. The
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this invention are the alkali metal , alkaline earth
metal, ammonium, alkylamine and dialkylamine salts of 8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate
ester. The alkali metal salts are those which are free from other conjugated esters
present in material found in natural sources of mixed esters. In addition, stabilized
salts of 8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate ester in combination with
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane are provided, as well as the use of the 8,9-dehydroestrone-3-sulfate 
ester salts in the treatment
of cardiovascular diseases.Furthermore, a process for the production of salts of 8,9-dehydroestrone
sulfate esters and their stabilized compositions is provided which affords excellent
product control. The process of this invention differs from methods generally
involved in the sulfation of steroids which are carried out by treatment of the steroid
with amine-sulfurtrioxide complexes followed by treatment with a cation exchange
resin mediated by strong alkaline bases, preferably in hydroxylic solvents. Those
reported methods for
