<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: PROTECTIVE SMOKE HOODTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to apparatus for protecting against the hazards of smoke and other noxious gases.BACKGROUND ARTFires, chemical spills, toxic fumes, and odors are an ever present danger to the occupants of buildings, factories, mines, or the like, especially when an escape route or exit from the location is not readily available. Various portable devices have been devised to assist an occupant of such an area to escape.Examples of such prior air survival units are illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,502,157; 4,554,683; 3,562,813; and 966,739. U.S. Patent No. 4,502,157 is broadly directed to a protective enclosure which essentially is pulled taut against the. chest of. the wearer and secured in this particular position by any fastening means, such that the body of the wearer including, in particular, the wearer's own chest, serves to close the open end of the bag. In short, Patent No. 4,502,157 relates to a particular way of draping and supporting a protective enclosure on the user. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,683 complements the coverage of Patent No. 4,502,157 that it broadly covers a protective enclosure which is designed to have its open end secured about the waist of the wearer and which includes armports through which the wearer inserts his or her arms.Patent No. 3,562,813, which expired on February 16, 1988 describes a protective head enclosure which is essentially a rigid structure and includes cylindrical lower section, an intermediate transparent or window section and an upper hemispherical section. 

 The expired Patent No. 996,739 discloses a protective enclosure which obviously was fabricated from the catagories of materials available in the early 1900's rather than modern day plastics. In all events, the hood or head piece is of an extent such that it drapes against the chest and the back of the wearer and is provided with eye openings which are covered by transparent material.An objective of the present invention is to provide an improved air survival unit that is compact, inexpensive, and lightweight and which enables the user to breathe normally in a toxic environment for a sufficient period of time to escape therefrom.Another objective is to provide such an improved survival unit in which the hood is formed of a flame-resistant, transparent plastic film which provides face and eye protection without effective visibility for the user and which provides free mobility to the user because no hookups or connections to sources outside the hood

 CLAIMS: 1. A protective smoke hood comprises an enlarged hood which may be filled with air and placed over the head of a wearer, characterized by said hood being made of material impermeable to air and hermetically sealed on all sides and unitarily integral except for a single opening along one side and closure means in combination with said opening, said hood being collapsible when not in use into a flat airless packet and dispen- sible by manipulation to allow ambient air to inflate
10 said hood, said opening being sufficient to allow said inflated hood to be placed over the head of the user and expanding said hood to provide an enlarged volume above the head of the user, whereby said opening
,_ may be secured substantially airtight about the neck of the wearer so that the wearer can, for a predetermined time, breathe the air within the hood free of external air.
2. The smoke hood according to Claim 1, wherein said hood is transparent.
2o 3- The smoke hood according to Claim 2, wherein said hood is made of plastic.
4. The smoke hood according to Claim 2 , wherein said closure means comprises a drawstring.
5. Apparatus for protection against smoke or 2 other gases, comprising an enlarged hood formed of flexible substantially transparent sheet material, impermeable to air, said hood having front and rear panels joined along their side edges by gussets, into a unitarily integral member fully enclosed and

 sealed, said hood having a single opening at the lower end to permit placement of a wearer's head into said hood, said hood being collapsible when not in use into a flat airless packet and distendible by manipulation to allow ambient air to inflate said hood, said opening being sufficient to allow said 


 inflated hood to be placed over the head of the user and expanding said hood to provide an enlarged enclosed volume above the head of the user, said apparatus further having a drawstring closure at the open end for closing 
â€¢
^ said hood about the neck of the wearer thereby allowing the wearer to breathe the air in said hood free of external air.
6. The apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein said sheet material is lightweight plastic. 
0
 7. The apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein the plastic is transparent.
