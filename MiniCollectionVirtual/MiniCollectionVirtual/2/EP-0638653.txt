<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a steel strip having an excellent cast metal toughness from a thin cast chromium-containing 
stainless steel containing at least 0.05 % in total of niobium, titanium and aluminum, which process 

comprises casting a stainless steel containing 13-25 % of chromium and at least 0.05 % in total of one or more 
elements of niobium, titanium, aluminum and vanadium and having a γp value as will be defined below of 0 % or less 

into a thin metal with a thickness of 10 mm or less, hot-rolling immediately thereafter the thin metal in a temperature 
range of 1,150-950 °C at a draft of 5 % or above, conducting either slow cooling at a cooling rate of 20 °C/s or 

heat retention for at least 5 seconds in a temperature range of 1,150-950 °C, and winding up the resultant strip below 
700 °C. γp(%) = 420C + 470N + 23Ni + 9Cu + 7Mn - 11.5Cr - 11,5Si - 12Mo - 23V - 47Nb - 49Ti - 52Al + 189 

(element content in wt.%).

<DESCRIPTION>
In recent years, a technology of casting a thin cast strip
having a strip thickness of 10 mm or less directly from a steel
melt was developed and tested on an industrial scale. This new
technology provides a process of producing a cold-rolled thin
sheet product, in which a hot rolling step is either simplified
or omitted, and thereby attracts considerable attention and is
expected from the view point of saving energy and cost.Processes of producing a thin sheet, including the above
process, will hereinafter be referred to as "STC processes"
(Strip Casting Process). In contrast, processes of producing a
cold-rolled thin sheet product which includes the steps of
continuous-casting a 100 mm or more thick steel slab, hot-rolling
the slab to a several millimeters thick hot-rolled strip,
and cold-rolling the hot-rolled strip, will be referred to as a
conventional process.The present invention relates to a process of producing a
thin cast strip having a high toughness, particularly a thin
cast strip of a Cr-stainless steel containing Nb, Ti, Al, etc.,
by an STC process.Conventionally, Cr-stainless steels were produced by a
conventional hot rolling-process which included casting a slab
and hot-rolling the slab. This process had a problem that
ridging (or roping) occurs in the cold-rolled thin sheet
products due to a texture established during hot rolling. Then,
trials were conducted in which the STC process was used to cast
a thin cast strip for producing a thin sheet product in which no
ridging occurs. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 62-176649 disclosed "Process of
Producing Ferritic Stainless Steel Thin Strip Having No Roping".
This publication, however, did not describe the reduction in
toughness which occurs in Cr-stainless steels having a single
phase structure and containing Nb, Ti, Al, and V in an amount
of from 0.05 to 1.0 wt% in total. Therefore, there remains a
problem that a cast strip of a Cr-stainless steel containing Nb,
Ti, Al and V in the above-recited total amount has too low a
toughness to be cold-rolled in a subsequent step.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 64-4458
entitled "Rapid-Cooled Strip of Ferritic Stainless Steel Having
High Toughness" disclosed that a cast strip having a high
toughness can be produced by controlling its columnar crystal
content to 70% or more, but did not consider the technological
significance of the relationship between the toughness of and
the precipitates in the cast strips of Cr-stainless steels
containing NB,
