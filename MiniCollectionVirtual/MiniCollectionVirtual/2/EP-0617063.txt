<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to propylene copolymers grafted to alpha , beta -ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives, comprising   ai) a random propylene copolymer (A1) containing from 0.1 to 15 % by weight of copolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes, or a2) a propylene copolymer (A2), a random propylene copolymer (I) containing from 0.1 to 15% by weight of copolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes and a random propylene copolymer (II) containing from 15 to 80% by weight of copolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes, or a3) a propylene copolymer (A3) comprising a propylene homopolymer (III) and a random propylene copolymer (IV) containing from 15 to 80% by weight of copolymerised C2- to C10-alk-1-enes, obtainable by reacting the monomer to be grafted with the propylene copolymer (A1), (A2) or (A3) at pressures of from 1 to 300 bar, where, in the presence of from 0.005 to 0.5% by weight of an initiator which decomposes to give free radicals, from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight of the monomer to be grafted, where both concentrations are based on the propylene copolymer, is mixed with the molten propylene copolymer, and the grafting reaction is carried out at from 200 to 350@C.

-C
10
-alk-1-enes
obtainable by reacting the monomer to be grafted with the
propylene copolymer at from 1 to 300 bar, from 0.01 to 1.0%

by weight of the monomer to be grafted, where both stated
concentrations are based on the propylene copolymer, being

added to the molten propylene copolymer in the presence of
from 0.005 to 0.5% by weight of a free radical initiator and

the grafting reaction being carried out at from 200 to 350°C.
A grafted propylene copolymer as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the propylene copolymer used is one which consists of


from 25 to 97% by weight of the random propylene copolymer
(I) and from 3 to 75% by weight of the random propylene copolymer

(II).
A process for the preparation of a grafted propylene copolymer
as claimed in claims 1 and 2 by reacting the monomer to

be grafted with the propylene copolymer at from 1 to 300 bar

and from 200 to 350°C, where from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight of
the monomer to be grafted, where both stated concentrations

are based on the propylene copolymer, is added to the molten
propylene copolymer in the presence of from 0.005 to 0.5% by 

weight of a free radical initiator, wherein a propylene copolymer
as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 is used.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the grafting reaction
is carried out at from 210 to 290°C.
A process as claimed in claims 3 or 4, wherein the monomer to
be grafted is used in a concentration of from 0.01 to 0.8% by

weight based on the propylene copolymer.
A process as claimed in claims 3 to 5, wherein the free radical
initiator is used in a concentration of from 0.01 to

0.2% by weight, based on the propylene copolymer.
A process for the preparation of a crosslinked or crosslinkable
propylene copolymer, wherein a grafted propylene

copolymer as claimed in claims 1 or 2 is reacted with an organic
crosslinking agent.
Use of a grafted propylene copolymer as claimed in claims 1
to 3 as adhesion promoters or in films, fibers or moldings.
