<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates principally to a
printing medium capable of recording with a recording
agent such as an ink, an ink containing a solid ink in a
state dissolved therein or a toner in which powder is
dissolved, an ink-jet printing process using this medium,
and an apparatus capable of using as an ink-jet printing
apparatus in recording instruments such as copying
machines and facsimiles, communication instruments,
business instruments, multi-functional instruments,
printers, etc. In particular, the present invention
relates to a printing medium suitable for use in
conducting ink-jet printing (textile printing) on a cloth
using ink-jet printing means and an ink-jet printing
process using this medium.In recent years, textile printing apparatus making
use of an ink-jet recording technique have been put to
practical use, and printed cloths with high definition
have come to be produced by a simple process. However, 
these apparatus are all industrial printing apparatus, and
it is hence substantially difficult under the
circumstances for users to easily conduct printing with
high definition as they please.As an invention relating to such an ink-jet printing
process, Yoshida, et al. disclose, in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 61-55277, an ink-jet printing
cloth in which a compound not substantially dyed is
contained in an amount of 0.1 to 50 % by weight in the
cloth, and an ink-jet printing process using this cloth.
According to this process, bleeding in ink-jet textile
printing can be prevented. In all examples thereof,
however, initial feedability of cloth in commercially-available
ink-jet printers is not considered. Therefore,
its use is virtually limited to a field of industrial
textile printing.As an invention by the same applicant as in the
present invention, Koike, et al. disclose, in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-53492, a textile
printing process comprising applying a recording liquid
containing a water-soluble dye to a cloth by an ink-jet
system and then optionally subjecting the cloth to a
dyeing treatment, wherein a recording liquid-receiving
layer having a viscosity of at least 1 Pa·s at 25°C is
formed on the cloth. According to this process, an ink,
or the recording liquid is received in the flowable 
receiving layer, whereby bleeding can be prevented to
obtain an ink-jet printed cloth high in quality. In an
example thereof, a 100% cotton broadcloth is immersed in a
liquid for the recording liquid-receiving layer having a
viscosity of 2.2 Pa·s and then lightly

<CLAIMS>
A printing medium (707), for use with an ink-jet
printer having an ink ejection orifice and supporting

means (709) provided facing the orifice for supporting a
printing medium and on which a cationic or anionic ink is

to be applied, the printing medium comprising a smoothed
cloth (602) to which an anionic or cationic dye-fixing

agent and a non-ionic stiffening agent (605) having a
non-dyeing property have been applied so that the

printing medium (707) has a Clark stiffness not lower
than 10 but not higher than 400, at least at its ends.
A printing medium (707) according to claim 1,
wherein the Clark stiffness is not lower than 20.
A printing medium (707) according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the Clark stiffness is not higher than 300.
A printing medium (707) according to claims 1, 2 or
3, wherein the stiffening agent (605) is present in an

amount of 0.01% to 20% by weight of the cloth (602).
