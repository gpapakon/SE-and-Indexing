<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bucket dredger (1), comprising a ladder assembly (6,3) which 
extends between an excavating end and a discharge end and has an endless conveyor (3) 

and a ladder (6) located between the upper and lower part thereof, the continuous 
conveyor (3) being provided with at least one scoop element (2) and an reverse unit (4) 

for the continuous conveyor (3) being fitted at the excavating end. To counteract 
turbidity of the water as a consequence of spillage, a gutter (35) is fitted beneath the 

ladder, which gutter (35) has its orifice behind or between the reverse unit (4). 
Furthermore, the upper part is enclosed between side plates (36) which are arranged 

essentially vertically. That section of the upper part which is located underwater 
preferably runs through a tunnel formed by the gutter (35), the side plates (36) and a 

cover (37). The lower part runs through a rinsing chamber located above water level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bucket dredger, comprising a ladder assembly 
which extends between an excavating end and a discharge end and has an endless 
conveyor and a ladder located between the upper and lower part thereof, the endless 
conveyor being provided with at least one scoop element such as a basket and an 
reverse unit for the endless conveyor being arranged at the excavating end, in which the 
ladder assembly is fitted with a plate extending beneath the upper part of the conveyor. A bucket dredger having bucket-like scoop elements is generally known and 
has the great advantage that, using said dredger, a uniform, flat and accurate bottom 
profile can be obtained and that bulky refuse causes little inconvenience to a bucket 
dredger which has scoop elements. However, when a bucket dredger is used, the so-called 
"spill" (that is to say spoil which is swept out of or from the scoop elements) 
causes the water to become very cloudy because, inter alia, fine soil particles are 
brought into suspension and swirl away, which particles then disperse through the water 
and settle again elsewhere. This is undesirable, for example, when dredging sludge 
contaminated with heavy metals and other hazardous substances, since pollutants have 
the tendency to adhere to fine soil particles in particular, and in the event of spillage 
and turbidity will therefore disperse through the water. For the above reasons, when contaminated sludge is dredged, in practice it is 
not bucket dredgers which are used, but suction dredgers or grab dredgers, which in 
theory should cause little turbidity. Suction dredgers have the disadvantage that, because 
water is sucked up as well, a large volume has to be dealt with, that bulky refuse can 
cause the suction device to seize or malfunction, and that the accuracy and flatness of 
the bottom profile obtained leaves something to be desired. With grab dredgers too it is 
very difficult to obtain an accurate and flat bottom profile and where there is bulky 
refuse, such as a block of wood, the jaws do not always close completely, with the 
result that spoil, such as sludge, can flow out of the jaws and the contamination can 
disperse. A bucket dredger according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-3,146,537. 
This US-A-3,146,537 discloses a bucket dredger which is provided with  
 
a two-part ladder assembly, around which an endless chain provided with buckets runs. 
The upper ladder section arranged above water level is provided with a plate which runs 
directly

<CLAIMS>
Bucket dredger (1), comprising a ladder assembly (6,3) which extends 
between an excavating end and a discharge end and has an endless conveyor (3) and a 

ladder (6) located between the upper and lower part thereof, the endless conveyor (3) 
being provided with at least one scoop element (2), such as a bucket, and a reverse unit 

(4) for the endless conveyor being arranged at the excavating end, in which the ladder 
assembly is fitted with a plate extending beneath the upper part of the conveyor, 


characterised
 in that the plate is part of a gutter (35), and that the gutter is arranged 
beneath the upper part of the conveyor and extends essentially from the discharge end 

to the excavating end of the ladder, such that the gutter collects spill and carries it away 
downwardly towards the excavating end of the ladder. 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 1, characterised in that the gutter (35) 
is arranged beneath the ladder and between the upper and lower part of the endless 

conveyor. 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the gutter 
(35) has its orifice behind the reverse unit (4). 
Bucket dredger according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the gutter (35) extends to between the reverse unit (4). 
Bucket dredger according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the upper part is enclosed between side plates (36) which are arranged essentially 

vertically and extend above a scoop element (2) passing along the upper part. 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 5, characterised in that the vertical 
side plates (36) extend along part of the reverse unit (4) located at the excavating end. 
Bucket dredger according to one of Claims 5-6, characterised in that a 
cover (37) which extends between the side plates (36) is fitted over at least that section 

of the ladder (6) which is underwater during dredging, such that the gutter (35), the side  
 

plates (36) and cover (37) form a tunnel through which the at least one scoop element 
(2) passes. 
Bucket dredger according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that that section of the lower part which is located above water runs through a rinsing 

chamber containing rinsing means (30,31), which chamber is located between two side 
walls and is provided on its underside with a collection trough (32), discharge means 

(33,34) being fitted to discharge rinsing water from the collection trough (32). 
Bucket dredger according to Claim 8, characterised in that the discharge 
means comprise a pump (33) and a pipe (34) to convey the rinsing water from the 

trough (32) towards the gutter (35).
