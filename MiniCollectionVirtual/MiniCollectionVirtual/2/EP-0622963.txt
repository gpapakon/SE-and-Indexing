<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for adaptively tuning to a received periodic
signal. The apparatus preferably employs digital signal

processing techniques for algorithmic generation of a
sinusoidal estimated output signal, determines the difference

between the estimated output signal and the received signal,
and generates an error signal based upon the difference

between the estimated output signal and the received signal.
The error signal is applied to vary at least one factor of the

algorithmic determination of the estimated output signal
appropriately to reduce the error between the estimated output

signal and the received signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus which 
will adaptively tune to a received periodic signal and, in one 
embodiment, will identify the frequency of the received signal 
to a user. Adaptive tuning to a received periodic signal is useful 
in a variety of situations, such as identifying frequency of 
a fire control or a search radar of a weapon system, tuning to 
a homing beacon or other similar navigational device, or, 
generally, tuning to or identifying any periodic signal of 
unknown frequency with speed and precision. Prior art devices for identifying and tuning to an 
unidentified (i.e., the frequency is unknown) received signal 
involved filtering the received signal through an array of 
high Q filters, and establishing a frequency range within 
which the received frequency is propagated by noting which of 
the high Q filters in the array passes the received signal. 
In order to provide a high degree of accuracy in ascertaining 
the frequency of the received signal, such prior art circuits 
must necessarily have a large number of high Q filters in the 
filter array. A greater number of filters reduces the 
interval between detectable frequencies and, therefore, 
increased the accuracy by which the received frequency can be 
determined. Thus, such prior art devices necessarily require that 
some estimation of the frequency of the received signal be 
known in advance in order that the frequency range detectable 
by the filter array can be assured to include the frequency 
expected to be received. In order to search a very wide 
frequency spectrum, it is sometimes required that a plurality  
 
of prior art devices be employed, with each device addressing 
a different range of frequencies. The prior art devices thus described are slow to operate, 
require foreknowledge of the range within the anticipated 
frequency of the received signal will fall, and require the 
use of analog devices, such as high Q filters, which are known 
by those skilled in the art to be less stable than digital 
circuit elements, especially when subjected to variations of 
ambient temperature. It is desirable that an apparatus be provided for 
detection of frequency of a received signal which is stable in 
operation in a variety of environments, which is capable of 
accurate determination of the frequency of the received 
signal, and which is capable of ascertaining the frequency of 
the received signal speedily. We will describe an apparatus for adaptively tuning to a 
received periodic signal. The apparatus
