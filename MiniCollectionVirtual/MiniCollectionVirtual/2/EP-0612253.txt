<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a non-stringy adhesive hydrophilic gel comprising an aqueous mixture of a radiation crosslinkable water-soluble polymer, at least one humectant effective to extend the moisture retaining characteristics of the gel and which inhibits the ability of radiant energy to crosslink the water-soluble polymer, a pharmacologically active agent, and a crosslinking promoter effective to counteract the crosslinking inhibitory effect of humectant. The aqueous mixture is exposed to radiant energy effective to provide a non-stringy adhesive cohesive homogeneous hydrophilic gel that has an extended in-use lifetime. The gels can be formed into PATCHES for long term application of the pharmacologically active agent to a patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADHESIVE HYDROGELS HAVING EXTENDED USE LIVES AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SAMEThis application is a continuation-in-part of applicant's copending application serial number 07/790,968, filed November 12, 1991, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.1. Field Of The InventionThe invention is directed to non-stringy adhesive hydrophilic gels (hydrogels) that resist premature loss of water and are capable of extending the useful life of items such as wound dressings, electrodes, cosmetics, ultrasound coupling sheets, topical or transdermal drug delivery systems, or other bodily contact hydrogel-based materials. The radiation crosslinked hydrogels of the invention contain an effective amount of at least one humectant to enable the hydrogels to remain pliable and tacky to the touch for much longer periods than previously known hydrogels.The properties exhibited by the new hydrogels of the invention allow the use of the hydrogels in a wide variety of applications, some of which have not been previously practicable. In particular, the hydrogels of the invention can be cooled, e.g., at 0° F for 16 hours, and used as cold packs without substantial loss of flexibility. The hydrogels also can be prepared to exhibit highly conductive properties. Hence, the present hydrogels can be employed in medical electrodes to provide an adhesive electrical contact with a patient's skin. The hydrogels also can be formulated to include pharmacollogically active agents and can be employed 

 as "PATCHES" to administer those agents to a patient by absorption of the agent from the gel into the patien 's ski .2. Background Of The InventionHydrophilic gels that contain up to 95 percent water are known. Some of these hydrogels were prepared by irradiation crosslinking and exhibited smooth non-tacky surfaces. More recently, hydrogels having interesting surface characteristics, such as adhesiveness, tackiness or non-stringiness, have been described. These hydrophilic gels can be manufactured into sheets and a number of applications have been disclosed which utilize these materials. For example, hydrogel-based wound dressings are available which permit water soluble drugs to migrate though the hydrogel film without disruption of the film's bacterial barrier properties (See, U.S. Pat. No. 3,419,006). Conventional hydrogels can impart a cooling sensation when applied to the skin. This property is desirable in applications that include contact with inflamed or sensitive areas of the body. However,
