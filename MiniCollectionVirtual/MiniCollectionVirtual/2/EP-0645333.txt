<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adjustable guide for web material (1) of differing width, with two lateral guide elements (2,3) which can be positioned at a spacing corresponding to the respective web width and a first of which can be adjusted towards or away from the second, each guide element (2,3) having a guide slot (14,15) for the associated edge region of the web material (1), and the two guide slots (14,15) pointing towards one another. For the optimum guidance of the material (1), it is recommended that the one flank (22), supporting the web material (1), of the guide slot (15) of at least one guide element (3) be displaceable relative to the other flank (24) of this guide slot (15) towards the other guide element (2), preferably be displaceable at least as far as the middle between the two guide slots (14,15).

An adjustable guide for strip material (1) of 
variable width, comprising two lateral guide elements 

(2,3) which may be positioned within the spatial extent 
of the respective width of the strip, of which a first 

is displaceable towards the second or away therefrom, 
wherein each guide element (2,3) has a guide slot 

(14,15) for the associated edge region of the strip 
material (1) and wherein the two guide slots (14,15) 

point towards each other, characterized in that the one 
side (22), supporting the strip material
 (1), of the 
guide slot (15), of at least one guide element (3) is 

displaceable relative to the other side (24) of this 
guide slot (15) towards the other guide element (2), 

and is preferably displaceable at least to the centre 
between the two guide slots (14,15). 
A guide according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the guide elements (2,3) are displaceable relative 

to each other by means of an adjusting spindle, and in 
that the adjusting spindle (4) forms elements of a 

mechanism for both lateral guide elements (2,3), 
wherein the second guide element (3) is adjustable by 

means of this mechanism relative to the first guide 
element (2) and at the same time as the said first 

guide element in such a way that both are moved towards 
each other (12,13) or away from each other. 
A guide according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that both guide elements (2,3) are 

displaceable in a preferably common longitudinal guide 
(16). 
A guide according to claim 3, characterized in 
that each lateral guide element (2,3) has two  

 
preferably parallel sliding surfaces (19,20) arranged 

in the spacing of the guiding sides (17,18) of a guide 
rail forming the longitudinal guide (16) for the guide 

elements (2,3). 
A guide according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the side (22) of the one guide 

slot (15) which may be advanced is formed by a surface, 
pointing towards the fixed side (24), of a sliding 

carriage (25) which is displaceably mounted on, or 
relatively displaceable to, the one guide element (3). 
A guide according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the sliding carriage (25) is mounted for 

displacement on two guide rods (26,27) which are 
parallel to the displacement direction (23) of the 

guide elements (2,3) and which engage into drilled 
holes of the two lateral guide elements (2,3) or 

penetrate the latter. 
A guide according to claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the sliding carriage (25) carries at least a 

first sensor (28) which operates as a reflex sensor or 
is switchable. 
A guide according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the first sensor (28), in the retracted starting 

position of the sliding carriage (25), is arranged 
opposite a second sensor (32) attached to the 

associated guide element (3), the two sensors (28,32) 
operating as forked light sensors. 
A guide according to claim 8, characterized in 
that when the sliding carriage (25) is advanced, the 

second sensor (32) is switched off and the first sensor 
(28) is switched to operate as a reflex sensor.  

 
A guide according to one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that the two sensors (28,32) are 

connected to a computer and the strip mechanism has a 
stepping motor, the stepping speed of which is preset 

by the computer in the case of section-by-section 
feeding of the strip.
