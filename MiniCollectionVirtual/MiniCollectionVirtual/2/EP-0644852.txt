<ABSTRACT>
Chlorine dioxide is continuously produced at high efficiency in a single vessel process by reduction of chlorate ions with hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous acidic medium maintained at its boiling point under a subatmospheric pressure. The hydrogen peroxide is pre-mixed with at least a portion of the aqueous chlorate solution feed or the sulfuric acid feed or a mixture thereof. By pre-mixing the hydrogen peroxide feed, the occasional decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and the resulting foaming of the generator liquor is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the production
of chlorine dioxide using hydrogen peroxide as the
reducing agent, and in particular to the production of
chlorine dioxide where the hydrogen peroxide is pre-mixed
with another reagent prior to being fed into the
generator.It is known to produce chlorine dioxide by reduction
of an acid aqueous chlorate solution using various reducing
agents such as methanol, chloride ions, hydrogen
peroxide, etc. In U.S. Patent No. 2,833,624 (Sprauer),
a process is described whereby chlorine dioxide is
produced by reacting chlorate ions, a strong acid and
hydrogen peroxide. The process can be carried out in
the presence of chloride ions, which are said to catalyze
the reaction. U.S. Patent No. 2,833,624, however, does
not teach carrying out the process in a single vessel under
subatmospheric pressure.U.S. Patent No. 4,421,730 (Isa et al) also discloses
a process to produce chlorine dioxide using hydrogen
peroxide. This process, however, requires the reduction
to be effected using chloride ions in the presence of a
complex palladium (II) catalyst and the hydrogen peroxide
in order to achieve commercially attractive production
rates.Recently, there issued U.S. Patent Nos. 5,091,166
(Engstrom et al) and 5,091,167 (Engstrom et al) wherein
chlorine dioxide is described as being produced in a single-vessel
generator-evaporator-crystallizer process
using hydrogen peroxide as the reducing agent. Hydrogen
peroxide for use in the process generally is employed
in its commercially-available form, generally an
aqueous solution containing about 30 wt% hydrogen
peroxide or higher. Alkali metal chlorate, hydrogen peroxide
and sulfuric acid are continuously fed to the generator.
Commercially acceptable production rates and
efficiencies are said to be obtained. The main distinction
between both processes is that U.S. Patent No.
5,091,166 covers the acidity range 2 to 5 N whereas U.
S. Patent No. 5,091,167 covers the acidity range 5 to 11
N.The operation of a hydrogen peroxide-based chlorine
dioxide generator using one of the processes described
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5.091.166 and 5.091.167
generally leads to satisfactory results in terms of the
chemical yield of chlorine dioxide on chlorate. These
processes, however, have certain deficiencies and disadvantages
which can seriously affect the operation of
the generator. For example, there can occasionally be
an excessive consumption of hydrogen peroxide, leading
to inefficient operation. Also there can be excessive
foaming of the liquor
