<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing fatty acid esters of short-chain monohydric aliphatic alcohols or monoalkylated diols by basically catalyzed esterification of natural, partially or totally synthetic fatty acid glycerides, as well as fatty acid glyceride-based waste products, such as used frying oils. The process is characterized in that the unpurified fatty acid glycerides, containing in particular high proportions of free fatty acids and phosphatides, (a) are esterified in one or several steps in the presence of a basic catalyst with an excess of short-chain alcohol or monoalkylated diol; (b) the glycerin phase produced after the first esterification step is at least partially added to the second or following step, after sterification has been carried out, and the mixture is stirred; (c) the glycerin phase is again separated, the supernatant fatty acid ester is cleared of excess alcohol or diol, then treated with a possibly diluted organic or anorganic acid, and if necessary filtered. This process, that is carried out without pressure and heat supply, is characterized by a technically simple implementation by means of simple equipment, and by a high degree of purity of the thus obtained fatty acid esters.

A method for producing fatty acid esters and fatty acid 
ester mixtures from short-chain monovalent alcohols with 1 to 

5 carbon atoms or short-chain diols with 2 to 5 carbon atoms, 
which are monoalkylated by alkyl residues with from 1 to 3 

carbon atoms, by transesterifying fatty acid glycerides with 
these alcohols or monoalkylated diols in the presence of base 

catalysts in several, preferably two stages, characterised in 
that 


a) transesterification is effected in the presence of from 
0.5 % to 5.0 %, based on the weight of the fatty acid 

glyceride used, of a base catalyst with an excess, exceeding 
the stoichiometric amount of 1 mol per mol of fatty acid 

bonded to glycerol, of from 0.1 to 2.0 mol of the short-chain 
alcohol or monoalkylated diol, optionally in the presence of 

0.5 % to 10 % water, based on the weight of the fatty acid 
glyceride used, from 4 tenths to 9 tenths of the overall 

quantity of base catalyst being used in the first stage, 
b) the glycerol phase obtained after completed 
transesterification after the first stage by settling and 

separation is added either wholly or partially, but at least 
in the amount of one tenth, with stirring to the second stage 

or a further stage after transesterification of said second 
or further stage and in that 
c) after settling and separation of the heavier glycerol 
phase and after removal of excess short-chain alcohol or 

monoalkylated diol, an optionally dilute organic or inorganic 
acid is added with stirring, and in that, after phase 

separation has been completed, the fatty acid ester phase is  
 

drawn off and optionally filtered. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
transesterification is effected in a temperature range of 

between -25°C and +60°C at atmospheric pressure. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in 
that in the first stage 4 tenths to 10 tenths and in the 

second or further stages 0 to 6 tenths of the total amount of 
short-chain alcohol or monoalkylated diol are used. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that in the second stage 1 tenth to 6 tenths 

of the total amount of base catalyst are used. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in all the transesterification stages 

the same short-chain alcohol or the same monoalkylated diol 
and the same base catalyst are used. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in the first stage a specific alcohol
 
or monoalkylated diol or a specific mix ratio of the alcohols 

or diols and a specific base catalyst and in the further 
stages a different alcohol or diol or a different mix ratio 

of alcohols or diols and a different base catalyst are used. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that methanol, ethanol, butanols, 

fermentation amyl alcohol, neopentyl alcohol or potato-spirit 
oils are used as the monovalent aliphatic alcohols and 

ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 1,2 propane diol monomethyl 
ether or ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether or mixtures 

thereof are used as aliphatic monoalkylated diols. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that basic alkali or alkaline earth metal  

 
compounds, for example the oxides, hydroxides, alcoholates, 

borates, carbonates, aluminates and silicates of lithium, 
sodium, potassium or calcium, in concentrated aqueous or 

alcoholic solution are used as catalysts. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

animal fats and oils, partially or wholly synthetic fatty

example, spent edible oils and fats, as well as spent 
engineering fats and oils with a glyceride base, for example 

soya oil, sunflower oil, linseed oil, rape-seed oil, castor 
oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, 

peanut oil, olive oil, beef fat, spent frying oil, spent 
hydraulic or lubricating oils of crude or unrefined quality 

or refined to any desired degree, with free fatty acid 
contents of up to 20 % or phosphatide contents of up to 3 %,
