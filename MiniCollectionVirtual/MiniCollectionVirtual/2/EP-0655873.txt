<ABSTRACT>
A data terminal is able to use data services of a cellular network so that it is
detachably connected to a mobile phone with a connection cable. The data

services need not be supported by the telephone. The connection cable forms a
fast synchronous serial bus. The service-specific data protocols needed in

implementing a data service are accomplished in a microprocessor unit in an
external interface adaptor connected to one end of the serial bus, said processor

being via the bus directly connected to the processor performing the signalling and
control functions and the channel coder of the phone. Thus, the interface adaptor

is able to exchange messages directly with the processor unit and the channel
coder of the phone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure and an apparatus, relating to the
connection between a data terminal means and a radio telephone.The modern digital cellular systems offer the user a great number of services in
addition to standard call transmission. For instance, in the Global Systems for
Mobile phones (GSM) system the services have been classified into three classes:
telecommunications, bearer and auxiliary services.The telecommunications services are services which are available to the network
subscriber. They enable data transfer between the users according to agreed
communications practices, i.e. protocols. In addition to transmission of telephone
calls, the GSM standard includes the following telecommunications services:
emergency call, automatic fax group 3, and short message service.The bearer services make the use of the telecommunications services possible.
They are divided into the following classes: circuit switched asynchronic data
transfer, circuit switched synchronic data transfer, Packet Assembly Disassembly
(PAD) communication as asynchronic data transfer, packet switched data, and
exchangeable speech/data transfer.The services are defined to be transparent and non-transparent. A transparent
service is not provided with flow control, and the error ratio thereof varies in
accordance to the mode of the radio channel. A non-transparent service includes
a flow control and a specific Radio Link Protocol RLP, provided with an Automatic
Repeat request ARQ, whereby the delays vary but the error ratio is low.When data services specified in digital cellular systems are used, they and the
transfer protocols associated therewith require a considerable amount of processing
capacity, as well as program and data memory capacity of the mobile phone,
because a data terminal connected to the phone, such as a facsimile device or a 
personal computer, uses data transfer protocols of its own, which in the phone
have to be adapted to the protocols of the cellular system to be used.PCT Application WO 93/02512 describes a common radio telephone part
comprising a transceiver, a speech coder, a microprocessor unit with a memory,
and a data arrangement block. A plurality of peripherals can be connected to the
common part via a data bus. The bus is a cable in which time division multiplexed
data transfer on a data bus is carried out between the part in common and the
peripherals. Each peripheral part also includes a data arrangement block which
formats the digital data produced by the part and
