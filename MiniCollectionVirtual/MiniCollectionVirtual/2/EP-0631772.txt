<ABSTRACT>
Skin care compositions comprise retinol and an irritation 
ameliorating amount of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is 

preferably present in an amount of at least 2%, and 
preferably about 5 to about 10% by weight of the 

composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to skin care compositions
containing retinoids which are generally applied topically
to improve the quality of the skin. More particularly,
this invention relates to skin care compositions
comprising retinol (Vitamin A alcohol) and further
comprising irritation ameliorating quantities of glycolic
acid.Skin care compositions containing retinoids have become
the focus of great interest in recent years. Retinoic
acid, also known as Vitamin A acid or tretinoin, is well-known
for the treatment of such skin conditions as acne
and products containing retinoic acid are commercially
available in various forms from the Dermatological
Division of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation.More recently, however, wider use or retinoids has been
suggested for treatments other than acne such as, for
example, the treatment of skin against photoaging and sun
damage. Many individuals who have had a good deal of sun
exposure in childhood will show the following gross
cutaneous alterations in later adult life: wrinkling,
leatheriness, yellowing, looseness, roughness, dryness,
mottling (hyperpigmentation) and various premalignant
growths (often subclinical) . These changes are most
prominent in light-skinned person who burn easily and tan
poorly. These cumulative effects of sunlight are often
referred to as "photoaging". Although the anatomical 
degradation of the skin is most advanced in the elderly,
the destructive effects of excessive sun exposure are
already evident by the second decade. Serious microscopic
alterations of the epidermis and dermis occur decades
before these become clinically visible. Wrinkling,
yellowing, leatheriness and loss of elasticity are very
late changes.The problem of skin aging is addressed in U.S. Patent No.
4,603,146 wherein Vitamin A acid in an emollient vehicle
is suggested as a treatment. Further, in U.S. Patent No.
4,877,805, it is suggested that a number of retinoids are
useful for restoring and reversing sun damage of human
skin.When considering the use of retinoids in skin care
products, it is believed that certain retinoids such as,
for example, retinol (Vitamin A alcohol), would be
preferred over retinoic acid. This is because retinol is
an endogenous compound naturally occurring in the human
body and essential for good growth, differentiation of
epithelial tissues and reproduction. Retinol is also
preferred because it has a much larger safety margin than
other retinoids such as retinoic acid. Accordingly,
attention has turned toward formulating skin care
compositions

<CLAIMS>
In a skin care composition comprising retinol as
an active ingredient, the improvement wherein the retinol

irritating properties of the composition are ameliorated
by employing glycolic acid in an amount of at least 2% by weight of

the composition.
The composition of claim 1 wherein said retinol
ameliorating amount is effective to ameliorate the

irritating properties of the composition as evidenced by
transepidermal water loss and skin fold thickness

measurements.
A composition of claim 1 wherein said glycolic
acid is present in a concentration of 5 to 10%

by weight of said composition.
The composition of claim 1 wherein said retinol
is present in a quantity of 0.001 to 5% by weight of

the composition.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the oil phase
of said composition is in weight ratio to the water phase

in a ratio from 5:95 to 99:1.
The composition of claim 5 wherein said
composition further comprises a chemical stabilizing

system selected from the group consisting of: 

a) a chelating agent and at least one oil soluble
antioxidant;
b) a chelating agent and at least one water soluble
antioxidant; and
c) antioxidant present in each of the oil and water
phases of said emulsion.
A method of ameliorating the retinol irritating
properties of a composition containing retinol comprising

including in said composition at least 2% gylcolic acid.
The method or claim 7 wherein said glycolic acid
is included in an amount from 5% to 10%.
