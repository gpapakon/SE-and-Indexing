<ABSTRACT>
In order to quantitatively determine a metal impurity 
contained in a fluorine-containing polymer directly, and also to 

improve a detection limit of the metal quantitative 
determination, there is provided a method for the quantitative 

determination of a trace amount of a metal impurity contained in 
a fluorine-containing polymer using a flameless atomic 

absorption spectrophotometer wherein a predetermined amount 
of a sample of the polymer containing the metal to be 

quantitatively determined is incinerated under incineration 
conditions including an incineration temperature in the range of 

about 400 to 1200 °C and an incineration period of at least about 
100 seconds, and then an absorbance of the incinerated sample 

as such is measured using the flameless atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer. In addition, there are provided a process for 

the production of the fluorine-containing polymer characterized 
in that the trace amount of the metal impurity contained in the 

fluorine-containing polymer is quantitatively monitored by 
means of the method, and a process for the production of the 

fluorine-containing polymer characterized in that the trace 
amount of the metal impurity contained in the fluorine-containing 

polymer is quantitatively determined by means of the 
method according to the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
determination of a trace amount of a metal impurity contained in
a fluorine-containing polymer (fluoropolymer), especially the
quantitative determination of a metal impurity contained in a
trace amount in a fluorine-containing polymer by using a so-called
flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and a
process for the production of a fluorine-containing polymer with
using said method.Fluorine-containing polymers are used in various
industrial fields, and it is very often that trace amounts of
metals contained in the polymers as impurities such as iron,
copper, nickel, sodium, potassium and so on cause problems. For
example, in a semiconductor relating field, a fluorine-containing
polymer such as a tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoro(alkyl vinyl
ether) copolymer (which is, hereinafter, referred to as "PFA") is
used for a basket wherein a leak error may be caused in a P-N
bonding when the trace amounts of the metals such as iron, 
copper, nickel and so on are dissolved out and they are present
in a semiconductor device.In addition, since an alkaline metal such as sodium,
potassium and so on is likely to cause insufficient withstand
voltage of an oxide film, it is Important to know the amounts of
the metals contained in the fluorine-containing polymer.
Further, also during production of the fluorine-containing
polymer, it is sometimes necessary to determine the trace
amounts of the metals contained in the fluorine-containing
polymer so as to ensure operation controls.E. L. Henn, Analytica Chimica Acta, 73 (1994) 273-281, which is considered to
represent the most relevant state of the art, discloses a method for the quantitative
determination of a trace amount of a metal impurity contained in a polymer using a flameless
atomic absorption spectrophotometer wherein, a predetermined amount of a sample of the
polymer is incinerated and then an absorbance of the incinerated sample is measured using
the flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The polymers analysed in E. L. Henn,
Analytica Chimica Acta, 73 (1994) 273-281 do not contain fluorine.A method which has been hitherto used so as to
quantitatively determine trace amounts of metals contained in a
fluoroplastic comprises charging the fluoroplastic to be
determined into a platinum made evaporating dish (of which
platinum purity is usually 99.9 %), incinerating the fluoroplastic
with a burner or in an electrical furnace, and then dissolving a
residue of the trace metals into a solution, which is
