<ABSTRACT>
A bistable electromagnet is brought from one working position to the other by a short direct current pulse, each pulse having a current flowing in the opposite direction from the previous one. A permanent magnet (23) arranged in the core area retains the armature (5) in one of the working positions against the force of an armature spring (14). By fitting the permanent magnet (23) in freely movable manner between two end positions in the direction of displacement of the armature in a cavity of the coil core (19), an electromagnet of this type may be produced without tolerance matching and requires less control energy. The coil core (19) may be pot-shaped and the permanent magnet is magnetically held to its bottom, whereas the permanent magnet (23) is retained by a stop in the other end position, so that its side that faces the armature (5) is approximately flush with the edge of the pot.

<CLAIMS>
Bistable electromagnet, especially magnetic valve, comprising a 
coil, a yoke, a coil core, an armature having two operating 

positions, a spring acting on the armature and comprising a 
permanent magnet disposed in the region of the core, which holds 

the armature against the spring force in the one operating 
position, characterized in that the permanent magnet (23) is 

freely movably guided in the movement direction of the armature 
in a cavity of the coil core (19) between two limiting positions 

determined by stops. 
Electromagnet according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
coil core (19) is constructed as a pot, against the base (21) of 

which the permanent magnet (23) magnetically adheres in the one 
limiting position, while the permanent magnet, in the other 

limiting position, is so held by a stop that its side 
facing towards the armature (5) is approximately flush with the 

edge of the pot. 
Electromagnet according to claim 2, characterized in that a 
magnetically non-conducting guide cage surrounding the permanent 

magnet (23), which cage is provided on its outer face with 
longitudinal grooves, is fixed in the pot-shaped coil core (19) 

or to the permanent magnet (23). 
Electromagnet according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
guide cage is a stainless steel pot (24). 
Electromagnet according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
permanent magnet (23) is glued into the guide cage.
