<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the purifying 
of waters for human consumption, which is simply realizable, 
does not give rise to the formation of mutagenic-cancerogenic 
agents, and does not cause, in purified 
waters, bad tastes, with the associated discomforts 
for users. Several processes are known for the treatment of waste 
waters in general. WO 92/15529 discloses a process for decreasing the 
concentration of organic carbon in an aqueous system, 
such as for example, lignin or lignocellulose waste 
streams, agricultural waste materials, waste streams 
from fiber processing operations etc, said process 
comprising the incorporation of a peroxygen composition 
in the acqueous system.  
 NL 9201631 discloses the disinfection of drainage water 
from plants grown on artificial media, e.g. stone wool, 
by addiction of a percarboxylic acid; the disinfected 
water can be recycled without causing plant diseases. JP 51094001 discloses a method to prevent slime formation 
in service water using material releasing H2O2 in 
water, for example organic peracid of peracetic acid 
etc, while JP 63097288 discloses a method for removing 
slime adhering to heat exchanger by adding hydrogen 
peroxide and organic peroxide to water in system. JP 54028447 discloses a method for deodorising phosphine-containing 
effluents by treating with oxidising 
agent such as peracetic acid in a closed vessel; JP 
54105852 discloses a process for the separation of 
foods, drugs etc. from solutions in a multistage separator 
where a fungicide such as for example peracetic 
acid is added periodically to the solution between each 
stage. CS 740587D discloses the preparation a biologically 
pure water by treating demineralised water with peracetic 
acid and passing it through ion exchange resin. Besides, waters for human consumption are drawn from 
natural hydric reserves, such as, for instance, lakes, 
rivers, natural or artificial basins, natural water 
beds, and the like, and before being run into the water 
systems they are subject, during the purifying, to 
treatments of various type, suitable to remove possible  
 
toxic substances, organic and/or inorganic pollutants, 
as well as the bacterial load which is present in such 
natural hydric reserves. In the last years, many experimental researches, carried 
out, for instance, by H.F. KRAYBILL J.Am. Water 
Works Assoc., 73.370 (1981); J.R. Meier Mutat. Res. 
196,211(1988), have noticed in purified waters the 
presence of mutagenic agents, which is cause for concern 
because
