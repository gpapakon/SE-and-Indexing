<ABSTRACT>
In order to draw-in underground collector mains, in particular to build horizontal filtering wells and drainage pipes, at least one bore (1) with an inlet (3) and an outlet (4) is made in predetermined soil layers. A filtering column drawing-in unit (5) which consists of an inner filtering column and of an outer enveloping pipe is drawn into the bore (1) and the outer enveloping pipe of the filtering column drawing-in unit (5) is then removed. A filtering column drawing-in unit which consists of an inner filtering column and an outer enveloping pipe is used as a tool for carrying out the process. In a preferred development of the invention, the intermediate space between the inner filtering column and the outer enveloping pipe is filled with filtering sand and/or gravel.

Method of laying subterranean supply pipes for
liquids and gases, particularly for the construction of

horizontal filtering wells and drainage pipes, with the
following method steps:


introduction of at least one bore (1) into
predetermined ground layers, wherein the bore respectively

has one entry opening (3) and one exit opening (4), and
drawing of a filter train insertion unit (5),
consisting of filter train (52, 53) and outer cladding tube

(51), into the respective bore (1); wherein
the filter train insertion unit (5) can be coupled to
an expander head (10);
upon withdrawal of the expander head towards the entry
opening, the filter train insertion unit is simultaneously

drawn into the bore; and
the diameter of the expansion head used is greater
than the diameter of the filter train insertion unit;
removal of the outer cladding tube (51) of the filter 
train insertion unit (5); wherein
the boring suspension creates no additional
permeability reductions in the ground.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
bore (1) is driven by means of a progression-controlled

boring method.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a
fully controllable, remotely-guided drill head

(14) is used for boring.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
bore is expanded a number of times step by step with

different size expansion heads, wherein the filter train
insertion unit is connected during

the last expansion step.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
inner filter train of the filter train insertion unit is

fixed above ground when drawing the outer cladding tube.
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the boring suspension used for boring,
which can also be clean water, is neutral in water and

biologically degradable. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the length of a bore (1) is 500 m or
more.
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 when withdrawing the cladding tube (51)
from the bore, water is simultaneously pressed through the

inner filter train (52, 53) under pressure into the bore (1).
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the bore (1) describes any randomly
curved path.
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the bore (1) is advanced to
predetermined positions.
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims
, 
characterised in that
 a camera is introduced in to the
inner filter train (53) for monitoring the state of assembly.
