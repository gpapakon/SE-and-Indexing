<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to
pharmaceutical formulations comprising aminoguanidine for
oral administration prepared with spray drying techniques
to form direct compression tablets.Spray-drying techniques have been used in previous
formulations, examples of which follow. However, spray-drying
has not been reported in connection with
aminoguanidine preparations.U. S. Patent no. 4,605,666 shows a preparation of
vitamin powders by spray drying a slurry containing
vitamin, binder, magnesium stearate and SiO2.U. S. Patent no. 4,710,519 shows a preparation of
acetaminophen powder by spray drying slurry of
acetaminophena and binder and adding magnesium stearate and
SiO2.U. S. Patent no. 4,892,889 shows a preparation of
vitamin powders by spray drying the mixture of vitam
gelatin, carbohydrate, fatty acid monoglyceride, SiO2 and
water.U. S. Patent no. 4,519,961 shows a preparation of free-flowing
powders of oxidation sensitive materials, a colloid
suspension of a substance and one or more saccharides. 
The spray adjuvant is silicic acid and a metal salt of a
higher fatty acid.U. S. Patent no. 4,916,163 shows an anti-diabetic
compound containing glyburide, and spray dried lactose.
Other excipients include SiO2 and magnesiumn stearate.JP Patent no. 03206034 shows a composition comprising
aminoguanidine derivative and mannitol which can be in a
tablet form.SU Patent no. 1172920 shows the preparation of free-flowing
cholin-chloride powder by spray drying.US. Patent no. 4,533,674 shows the preparation of
vitamin C powder by spray drying a slurry or vitamin,
binder and SiO2.JP 50157517 shows the preparation of triglyceride
tablets by spray-drying a suspension of compounds with
casein, starch and dextrin.EP 436373 shows the preparation of naproxen tablets by
spray drying slurry of compound or its salt and excipients.Various patent applications and patents on
aminoguanidine include JP 75001255, JP 71016967, EP 339496,

3,659,016, US 3,714,363, BE 748407 and US 3,621,056.A method of making a direct compression tablet
suitable for commercial pharmaceutical use comprising
between about 50% to about 99% aminoguanidine or
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by weight of the
tablet comprising:
combining a sufficient amount of aminoguanidine or
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a
sufficient amount of an aqueous solution capable of

A method of making a direct compression tablet
suitable for commercial pharmaceutical use comprising

between about 50% to about 99% aminoguanidine or
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof by weight of the

tablet comprising:

combining a sufficient amount of aminoguanidine or
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a

sufficient amount of an aqueous solution capable of
substantially dissolving the aminoguanidine or

pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a
sufficient amount of a suitably compatible binder to

produce an aminoguanidine solution;
spray-drying the aminoguanidine solution into a
drying chamber under conditions sufficient to obtain a

spray-dried powder suitable for direct compression into
tablets; and
sufficiently compressing the spray-dried powder
into a compressed tablet for administration to a

patient.
The method of claim 1 wherein the aminoguanidine
salt is aminoguanidine hydrochloride.
The method of claim 1 wherein the amount of
aminoguanidine is from about 80% to about 99% weight by

weight of the tablet.
The method of claim 1 wherein the amount of
aminoguanidine is from about 95% to about 97% weight by

weight of the tablet.
The method of claim 1 further comprising adding an 
effective amount of a suitably compatible excipient to the

spray-dried powder.
The method of claim 5 wherein the excipients are
selected from the group consisting of micro-crystalline

cellulose, calcium stearate, hydroxypropyl cellulose,
colloidal silicon dioxide and stearic acid.
The method of claim 5 wherein the aminoguanidine is
aminoguanidine hydrochloride present in an amount of from

about 95 to about 97%, the binder is hydroxypropyl
cellulose, and the excipients are colloidal silicon dioxide

and calcium stearate.
The method of claim 1 wherein the binder is a water
soluble cellulose.
The method of claim 8 wherein the binder is
hydroxypropyl cellulose.
A direct-compression tablet comprising from about
50% to about 99% aminoguanidine or pharmaceutically

acceptable salt thereof for administration to a patient
prepared by a process according to any one of claims 1 to 9. 
The direct-compression tablet of claim 10 wherein
the tablet has a friability value less than 1%.
