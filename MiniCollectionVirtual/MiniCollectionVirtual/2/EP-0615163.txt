<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to positive resist materials using
particular onium salts and, more particularly, to particular
onium salts suitable for positive resist materials of the type
which are highly sensitive to high energy radiations, such as
deep ultraviolet rays (DUV),electron beams and X-rays, developable
with an aqueous alkali solution and well suited for fine
processing technology.In proportion as large scale integrated circuits (LSI) are
heightened in integration level and operation speed, further
fining the pattern rules is required. However, the light hitherto
used in photoexposure technology contained different wavelengths,
and these wavelengths were long. Consequently, there
was a limit in fining the pattern rules. Thus, it was tried to
use as light source g-line (436 nm) or i-line (365 nm) emitted
from an ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp.Even in those cases, however, the pattern rule limit was
about 0.5 µm with respect to resolution, and the manufacture of
LSI utilizing such photoexposure arts can attain at best the
integration level corresponding to 16 Mbit DRAM.In this context, deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography using
as a light source deep ultraviolet rays, which are shorter in
wavelength than g-line and i-line, appears to offer promise as
a new processing technology.DUV lithography can achieve 0.1-0.3 µm resolutions in the
imaging process, and can provide a pattern having effectively
vertical walls with respect to the substrate if a resist having
a low optical 
absorbance is used. Moreover, as this technology makes it possible to
transfer a pattern in one operation, it offers a higher throughput than
electron beam lithography.In recent years, on the other hand, high intensity KrF excimer
laser has been successfully used as the light source for DUV
lithography. In order that DUV lithography using such a light source
has practical utility in mass production of LSI, it is necessary to use
resist materials having low optical absorbance and high sensitivity at
the wavelength of that laser.Thus, there have been lately developed the chemical amplification
type resist materials which use an acid as a catalyst and possess not
only sensitivities equivalent to or higher than those of conventional
high sensitivity resists but also other excellent properties including
high resolution and high dry-etching resistance (as proposed, e.g., by
Liu et al in J. Vac. Sci. Technol., Vol. B6, p. 379 (1988)). As for
the negative resists of the aforementioned type, Shipley Company is
already marketing a
