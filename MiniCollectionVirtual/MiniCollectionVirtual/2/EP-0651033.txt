<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to expandable coating composition, more
particularly to an expandable coating composition useful for making wallcovering
having a 3-dimensionally patterned surface. The invention also relates to a method
for making the wallcovering.Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 53-59728 discloses a heat-expansible covering
composition produced by dispersing 5 weight percent to 50 weight percent, or, more
preferably, 10 weight percent to 30 weight percent, heat-expansible microspheres in
a crosslinking type synthetic resin emulsion. The crosslinking type synthetic resin
emulsion is a an epoxy emulsion, a urethane emulsion, self-crosslinking type acrylic
emulsion or a reaction type acrylic emulsion that may be crosslinked using a
crosslinking agent. The covering is printed or coated onto a substrate and heated to
expand and crosslink the coating and thereby form an ornamental material having
an irregularly patterned layer on the surface of the substrate.Japanese Patent Disclosure No. JP-A-53 006 340 discloses polystyrene beads
"impregnated" with low boiling hydrocarbons. This is not the same as the
expandable particles with a liquid blowing agent contained within a thermoplastic
shell.U. S. Patent No. 4,094,685 teaches a composition requiring a dispersing agent,
a bridging solvent and a thickener. These are all required to add some strength to
the coating, but the compositions disclosed are not required to be "hard". The Tg of
the terpolymer latex contained in the compositions exemplified is calculated to be in
the range of -27°C ("soft"). The coating composition is not required to be hard since
it is mixed with paints, dyes and inks to form an expandable coating primarily for
decorative (aesthetic) purposes.U. S. Patent No. 4,833,173 discloses a process for preparing a coagulated
material, not an expandable coating. The foaming agent, saturated on microspheres
and not encapsulated as required by the present invention, is not included in the
process to form an expandable coating. The foaming agent is included to ensure
that, "undesirable film forming does not occur." In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
expandable aqueous coating composition, comprising latex particles including a
copolymer having a glass transition temperature from -20°C to +60°C and a weight
average molecular weight from 20,000 to 500,000; and expandable particles
comprising a liquid blowing agent contained within a thermoplastic shell.The expandable coating composition is useful
