<ABSTRACT>
Increased resistance to deformation caused by internal pressure within a heat 
exchanger acting in a direction generally transverse to the length of tubes (18) extending 

between spaced headers (10,12) is achieved in a construction wherein side 
pieces (22) sandwiching the core defined by the tubes (18) and interposed fins (20) 

are coupled by means of tie bars (30) having transverse ends (32) embracing the side 
pieces (22). Resilient clips (40) act to secure the tie bars (30) to the side pieces (22) 

and include retention notches (54) to positively hold the clips (40) assembled to the 
structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heat exchangers as, for example, radiators for the 
coolant employed with internal combustion engines, and more specifically, to a tie 
bar and clip construction useful in such heat exchangers. Many heat exchangers today, as, for example, vehicular radiators, employ so-called 
flattened tubes extending between opposed headers. Serpentine fins are disposed 
between and bonded to the flattened tubes on the flat side walls thereof. In operation, the fluid within the heat exchanger, typically an engine coolant, 
receives heat rejected from the heat source such as an internal combustion engine and 
as a consequence, has its temperature elevated. This, in turn, means that the internal 
pressure within the heat exchanger is likewise elevated. Because the tubes are 
flattened, internal pressures will be acting against a flat inner surface of the flat side 
walls of the tubes and as is well known, this pressure will tend to make the tubes "go 
round". In plate fin heat exchangers, the plate fins provide necessary pressure restraint 
by positively confining the tube side walls. Serpentine fins, however, may have  
 
insufficient strength to confine the tubes to prevent the 
tube minor dimensions from expanding in response to 
pressure. As a consequence, upon pressurization, a heat 
exchanger may tend to "grow" in the direction transverse 
to the direction of the elongation of the tubes. To avoid this problem, heat exchangers are 
conventionally provided with side pieces which sandwich 
the tubes and the serpentine fins. The side pieces 
typically extend between the headers as do the tubes, and 
are frequently formed of channels for enhanced rigidity. 
Thus, expanding forces transverse to the direction of 
elongation of the tubes may be transmitted to the side 
pieces of the resulting heat exchanger core to be resisted 
by the strength provided by the side pieces, as well as 
the headers themselves which may serve to anchor opposite 
ends of the side pieces in many heat exchanger 
constructions. While this type of constraint works well in a 
number of instances, generally, its success is limited to 
relatively small heat exchangers having relatively short 
tubes and side pieces. In larger heat exchangers having 
relatively long tubes and side pieces, it is generally 
been necessary to increase the rigidity of the side pieces 
to resist the deformation due to internal pressure within 
heat exchanger. This in turn has increased the cost of 
heat exchangers as a result of the additional

a pair of spaced headers (10,12), each having a 
plurality of tube receiving holes (14) with the tube 

receiving holes in one header being aligned with and 
facing the tube receiving holes in the other; 
a plurality of elongated tubes (18) extending 
between and secured to said headers, and having opposite
