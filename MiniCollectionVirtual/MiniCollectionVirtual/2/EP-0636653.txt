<CLAIMS>
Elastomeric polypropylenes, modified with ethylenically
unsaturated graft monomers and having a stereoregular

block arrangement in the chain structure (ELPP),
and blends thereof with isotactic polypropylenes (IPP),

which are modified with ethylenically unsaturated graft
monomers.
Modified ELPP and blends thereof according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the graft monomers belong

to the group consisting of the ethylenically unsaturated
aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids or derivatives

thereof.
Modified ELPP and blends thereof according to
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the graft monomers

belong to the group consisting of maleic acid or derivatives
thereof, acrylic acid or derivatives thereof or

methacrylic acid or derivatives thereof.
Modified ELPP and blends thereof according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the graft monomers belong

to the group consisting of the vinyl aromatics or esters
of vinyl alcohol.
Modified ELPP and blends thereof according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the content of

graft monomers (degree of grafting) is 0.1 to 30% by
weight, preferably 0.5 to 10% by weight, particularly

preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight.
Modified ELPP and blends thereof according to one
of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that they contain 0 to

80% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 50% by weight, of
modified IPP.
Process for the modification of elastomeric
polypropylenes having a stereoregular block arrangement

in the chain structure (ELPP) or blends thereof with
isotactic polypropylenes (IPP), characterized in that

ELPP or blends of ELPP and IPP are grafted with ethylenically
unsaturated graft monomers.
Use of modified ELPP and/or blends thereof with
modified IPP according to one of Claims 1 to 7 as compatibilizers 

in blends of polyolefins with nonolefinic
thermoplastics.
Use of modified ELPP and/or blends thereof with
modified IPP according to one of Claims 1 to 7 as

adhesion promoters in composites or laminates of
polyolefins and metals.
Blend of polyolefins and nonolefinic thermoplastics,
characterized in that it contains, as

compatibilizer, modified ELPP and/or blends thereof with
modified IPP according to one of Claims 1 to 9.
