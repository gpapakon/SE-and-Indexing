<ABSTRACT>
A probe (1) for making electrical connections to the legs (3) of an already mounted 
integrated circuit (4) carries rows (2) of tapered wedges (8). The wedges within a row are 

spaced apart by an amount that corresponds to the width of the IC's legs. For n-many legs 
on a side of the IC there are n+1 corresponding wedges, which then have n-many 

intervening spaces. As the positioned probe is pressed down the spaces between the 
wedges receive the legs of the IC, and wedges become wedged between the IC's legs. Each 

wedge has left and right conductive surfaces (22) separated by an insulator (19,20,21). 
Each leg of the IC has a wedge to its left and a wedge to its right. Within the probe the 

right-hand conductive surface of the wedge to the left of a leg, and the left-hand conductive 
surface of the wedge to the right of that leg, are electrically connected together. Thus, the 

probe makes electrical contact to each leg in two places. The tapered wedges are of Ni-and 
Au-plated BeCu separated by acrylic adhesive and Kapton. Acrylic adhesive and 

Kapton are also used as the spacer between wedges. The rows of wedges (48-57) are 

cemented to a mantle (52). A lead frame (59) soldered to the butt end of the wedges 
connects opposing surfaces of adjacent wedges and makes the interconnection between the 

rows of wedges and an array of pins (61) in a pin block (60) at the top of the probe. Sticks 
of coplanar wedges are made by laminating layers of material in a press. The taper of the 

wedge tip arises from layers of shorter length in conjunction with a shaped surface in the 
laminating press. N+1 sticks are laminated together with intervening spacers to form a 

stack from which rows of n+1 wedges may be removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to connecting apparatus
including a plurality of fingers.The measurement of electrical signals on the leads or legs of an integrated circuit (IC)
package, or the application of external electrical stimulation to the legs of an IC, has become
increasingly problematic with the continued decrease in the size of the legs and the space
therebetween, coupled with increasing numbers of legs on a package. The circuit probing techniques
originated for use with test equipment such as voltmeters and oscilloscopes are simply impractical
for use with surface mount components of half-millimeter or less lead pitch. Increasingly, the task
of connecting logic analyzers, timing analyzers, emulators and automatic board testers to surface
mounted integrated circuits is becoming mechanically difficult, less reliable and definitely more
expensive.As the size of the legs and their intervening space decreases, a number of problems are
exacerbated. Because of the legs' smaller size, there is less contact surface, and what there is of it
may be coated with a residue of solder resist or flux. Contact mechanisms, such as the one disclosed in US-A-5 015 946, that rely upon making
contact with the outer face of the legs run the risk of poor contact either because of poor wiping
action against the leg by the corresponding contact in the probe or because of insufficient contact
pressure. Alignment is becoming increasingly critical, with the associated risk that the probe's
contacts may short adjacent legs together. To ensure that the probe does not fall off inadvertently,
some manufacturers are equipping their IC probes with grippers that engage the corners of the IC
package. These grippers have to be replaceable because they are easily broken.A further problem arises with conventional probes: They tend to have a bigger "footprint"
than the IC's they probe, and as those IC's get smaller, the footprints do not scale down as fast in
size as do those IC's. Thus, as the density of circuit boards increases so does the problem of
interference between a probe for an IC and the components adjacent that IC.The present invention seeks to provide improved connection apparatus.According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided
apparatus as specified in claim 1. The preferred embodiment is directed to
wedging a strip of conductive material between adjacent legs of an IC. If one side of the material
is backed by an insulator then the adjacent legs will not be shorted together. Let the wedge be
flexible

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) comprising:

a plurality (2) of n fingers (8), each comprising a core of alternating layers of
adhesive (21) and filler (20), at least one layer of which is nonconductive, and a conductive

cladding (22) on each of two opposing sides of the core, each finger of the plurality having
a first end where the conductive claddings lie within planes that are parallel and each finger

having a second end where the conductive claddings converge; and
a plurality of n-1 spacers (14), each spacer adhered on two opposing sides to the
respective conductive claddings at the first ends of two adjacent fingers.
Apparatus as in claim 1, wherein the alternating layers in the core extend uniformly
to the first end and at least one layer in the core is too short to extend to the second end.
