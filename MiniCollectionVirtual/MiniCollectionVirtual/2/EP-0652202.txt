<ABSTRACT>
Formic acid or derivatives thereof are produced from 
non-toxic carbon dioxide in the supercritical state, using 

it as raw materials, without using solvents, and at a high 
efficiency owing to a high reaction velocity, by reacting 

said carbon dioxide and an active hydrogen group-containing 
compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing 
formic acid or derivatives thereof. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to a novel method to produce 
formic acid or derivatives thereof, which are useful as raw 
materials, etc. in the organic chemical industry, by the 
reaction of carbon dioxide in the super critical state with 
an active hydrogen group-containing compound at a reaction 
velocity not attainable in the conventional liquid phase 
reaction. Formic acid and their derivatives have been and are 
useful as basic raw materials, etc. in the organic chemical 
industry, and extensively used in various industrial sectors 
for the production of, for example, chemicals, plastics, 
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, etc. Formic acid is conventionally produced from caustic soda 
and carbon monoxide, or from lime and carbon monoxide as raw 
materials. The conventional methods use toxic carbon monoxide (CO) 
and thus are not favorable. A number of new production 
methods has been developed in an attempt to replace the 
conventional methods that use carbon monoxide. Actually, 
several methods to use carbon dioxide (CO2) as raw materials, 
replacing carbon monoxide (CO), have been reported 
recently. These introduce a method to produce formic acid 
from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2). These methods 
include, for example, (I) a method to produce formic acid by  
 
using magnesium formate with titanium tetrachloride, 
magnesium and tetrahydrofuran base as described in J. Organometal. 
Chem., 80 C27 (1974), (II) a method to produce 
formic acid from carbon dioxide and hydrogen in a benzene 
solvent in the presence of a palladium, ruthenium, iridium, 
or rhodium catalyst and an organic amine such as triethylamine 
as described in Chemistry Letters (1976), p863, (III) a 
method to produce formic acid from carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
in the presence of water and a metal salt using ruthenium 
catalyst as disclosed in the provisional Japanese patent 
application No. 56-140948, and (IV) a method to produce 
formic acid from carbon dioxide and hydrogen in a dimethylsulphoxide 
or water solvent using a rhodium complex in the 
presence of water and triethylamine as described in J. Chem. 
Soc. Commun. p623 (1992) and p1465 (1993). These conventional known methods use, without exception, 
a large amount of solvents for reaction, and thus complicated 
procedures are required to separate formic acid as the 
reaction product, from catalysts and solvents. Further, all 
these methods do
