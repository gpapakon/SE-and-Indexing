<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of producing tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazin-2-thion powder (I) substantially free of dust fines by reacting methylamine (II) with carbon disulphide (III) and formaldehyde (IV) or by reacting the methylammonium salt of N-methyldithiocarbamic acid (V) with formaldehyde (IV), characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one diaminoalkylene of the formula (VI): R
<

>
-NH-A-NH-R
<
2

, in which R
<
1
>
 and R
<
2
>
, independently of each other, are hydrogen or an alkyl group and A is an optionally substituted 1,2-ethylene, 1,3-propylene or 1,4-butylene bridge.

A process for the preparation of substantially 
dust-free granules of tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 

(I) by reacting methylamine (II) 
with carbon disulfide (III) and formaldehyde (IV) or by 

reacting the methylammonium salt of N-methyldithiocarbamic 
acid (V) with formaldehyde (IV), wherein the 

reaction is carried out in the presence of from 0.1 to 
10 mol %, based on II, of at least one diaminoalkylene of 

the formula VI 

R
1
-NH-A-NH-R
2
 
where R
1
 and R
2
 independently of one another are each 
hydrogen or C
1
-C
4
-alkyl and A is a 1,2-ethylene, 1,3-propylene 
or 1,4-butylene bridge, and these bridges may 

carry from one to four C

-C
4
-alkyl groups. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out in the presence of a finely 

divided tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 
(I). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least 
one diaminoalkylene of the formula VI as claimed in claim 

1 is used, R
1
 or R
2
 independently of one another each 
being hydrogen, methyl or ethyl and A being an ethylene 

bridge which in turn may carry one or two methyl or ethyl 
groups. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction is carried out in the presence of from 0.2 to 

5 mol %, based on II, of a diaminoalkylene of the formula 
VI as claimed in claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the  
 

finely divided tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 
(I) is used in an amount from 1.5 to 10 mol %, 

based on V. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
finely divided tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 

(I) has a particle size of less than 100 Âµm. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
finely divided tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 

(I) is used in the form of an aqueous 
suspension. 
Substantially dust-free granules of tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione, 
obtainable by a 

process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the granules 
contain dimers or higher polymers of the active 

ingredient in which dimers or higher polymers two 
nitrogen atoms not belonging to the same molecule I are 

linked to one another by a 1,2-ethylene, 1,3-propylene or 
1,4-butylene bridge corresponding to the substituent A as 

claimed in claim 1. 
A method of soil decontamination, which comprises 
treating the soil with an effective amount of 

substantially dust-free granules of tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 
as claimed in claim 

8. 
A method of controlling nematodes, germinating 
plants and soil fungi, which comprises treating the earth 

with an effective amount of substantially dust-free 
granules of tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione 

as claimed in claim 8. 
The use of substantially dust-free granules of 
tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione as 

claimed in claim 8 for soil decontamination. 
The use of substantially dust-free granules of 
tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione as 

claimed in claim 8 for controlling nematodes, germinating 
plants and soil fungi.
