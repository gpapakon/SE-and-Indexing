<ABSTRACT>
Telephone line status indication is improved by making 
measurements of the differential voltage across the Tip-Ring terminals of a 

telephone set (100). The telephone set is connected to a telephone line 
which is shared with other parallel-connected telephone sets. The 

measurement of differential line voltage is made each time the set changes 
state (i.e., between on-hook and off-hook). The maximum magnitude of one 

of the last three measurements is stored to represent the on-hook state, and 
is arithmetically averaged with the maximum magnitude of one of the last 

three stored for the off-hook state to create a reference voltage. The 
reference voltage is updated each time the telephone set changes state and 

is continually compared with the present differential line voltage to 
determine which one is larger. A light-emitting-diode (110) on the 

telephone set indicates that the telephone line is in use whenever the 
reference voltage exceeds the measured differential line voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone sets and
to methods for detecting the status of a telephone line.The cost of telephone sets has decreased to such a degree that
many, perhaps most, homes are now equipped with several of them. New
homes are pre-wired for telephones in every room, and older homes are
being re-wired to strategically add telephones at various locations. All of
this effort is aimed at improving convenience so that telephones can be
within easy reach -- no matter where individuals are located within the
home, whether in the basement or the bedroom. The proliferation of
telephones within the home has been encouraged by the tact that they can
all share the same wire-pair. This has led to problems when more than one
person wants to use the telephone at the same time. In particular, it is
annoying for a person already engaged in a telephone conversation to
endure the loud sounds that occur when another person begins dialing.
Furthermore, there still exist sensitive persons who feel badly when they
disturb others. These concerns have been addressed by telephone sets that
visually display the status of the telephone line. Typically, a light emitting
diode associated with a telephone set is turned ON whenever another
telephone set, that shares the same line, is in an off-hook (active) state.
However, detecting the off-hook state is not as easy as one might suspect.Telephone Office equipment furnishes DC power to each
telephone set over the telephone line that interconnects them. When the
telephone is in an on-hook (idle) state, there is practically no DC current
flow over the telephone line. When the telephone set is in the off-hook
state, there is a limited amount of DC current flow which is used to power
the telephone set and is detected by the Telephone Office to activate
equipment to serve the telephone set. U.S. Patent 4,451,707 discloses a
known design for a line status circuit which uses a fixed reference voltage to 
determine whether the telephone set is in its on-hook or off-hook state.
However, the amount of DC current flow over the telephone line is highly
variable because, for example, the length of the telephone line varies
considerably, so the voltage across the line is not the same among
telephones in the off-hook state.Determining the appropriate on-hook/off-hook reference voltage
is further complicated by the existence of low-voltage SLC (Subscriber Loop
Carrier) lines which can have an on-hook voltage of 12 volts. This is less
than the off-hook voltage of some telephones on very
