<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of suture needles 
and, more particularly, a process for enhancing the 

physical strength of the suture needles through an 
expedient cold-working or cold-forming procedure. Also 

disclosed is the provision of a novel and physically 
strengthened suture needle, particularly a surgical 

suture needle possessing a curvilinear configuration 
wherein the cross-sectional configuration of the needle 

is cold-formed into varying shapes in order to produce a 
needle having superior physical characteristics and 

strengths imparted thereto through the inventive process. 
The needles are essentially cold formed, and which 

process includes the aspect of imparting to straight 
metal rods which are preferably constituted from 

stainless steel, manufacturing steps which include 
sharpening one end of rod severed segments so as to form 

the needle tip, thereafter curving the needle with the 
metal still being in a relatively ductile state, and 

subjecting the needle to a cold forming process, such as 
through the intermediary of pressure die molds or 

stamping, to produce varying cross-sectional shapes along 
the length of the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
the manufacture of suture needles and, more particularly,
relates to a process for enhancing the physical strength
of the suture needles through an expedient and novel
cold-working or cold-forming procedure. Moreover, the
invention also relates to the provision of a novel and
physically strengthened suture needle, particularly a
surgical suture needle possessing a curvilinear
configuration wherein the cross-sectional configuration
of the needle is cold-formed into shapes in order
to produce a needle having superior physical
characteristics and strengths imparted thereto through
the inventive process.Currently, various types of processes are known
and widely utilized in the technology relating to the
manufacturing of suture needles, and particularly needles
which are adapted to have sutures fastened thereto by
means of various types of procedures so as to meet the
stringent requirements of the suture needle-manufacturing
technology for so-called armed sutures. Generally,
suture needles are formed from suitable metals,
especially such as different types of stainless steel,
wherein the needles are produced from thin rod material
which is ordinarily cut into appropriate lengths
commensurate with the length of the intended suture 
needle. The severed length of rod usually has one end
thereof formed into a needle point, or has a needle point
attached to that end, and has appropriate cross-sectional
dimensions imparted thereto, such as through stamping,
laser processing, grinding or the like, and thereafter
curved into the finished curvilinear configuration prior
to the attaching thereto of a suture. Sutures are then
attached to the end of the formed suture needle opposite
the needle point through either the application of
suitable adhesives, or by being placed into a groove
formed at that end of the needle and thereafter the
suture-needle assembly swaged to formulate an appropriate
permanent fastening between the needle end and the
contiguous end of the suture, thereby forming a so-called
armed suture arrangement.In some instances, the metallic material of the
suture needle is also subjected to a heat treatment in
order to complete the needle manufacturing process.US Patent 1 592 897 discloses a method
of making a needle including producing
recesses in one side of the needle,
before or after the needle is curved
and while the needle is still in its
annealed state. Among various processes directed to the forming
of suture needles are those disclosed in Kawada et

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a suture needle (10) from a rod
element (20) constituted of metallic material, comprising the

steps of:

a) cutting said metallic rod element (20) to a
predetermined length;
b) bending said cut rod element (20) into a specified
curvilinear configuration;

characterised in that the process further comprises the step of
c) cold-working
said curved rod element (20) to form indentations or grooves (36, 38)

on two opposite sides of the suture needle (10) along the length thereof
excluding a tip portion (26) which has a circular cross-section (40).
A process as claimed in claim 1, comprising the step of
forming a sharp needle tip (26) at one end (22) of said suture needle

(10) preceding the step of bending said rod element (20) into said
curvilinear configuration.
A process as claimed in claim 2, comprising forming an
end (24) of said suture needle (10) distant from said first end (22) into

a shape adapted for the attachment of a suture to said

needle (10).
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
said cold-working comprises the step of cold-forming said

needle (10) by the application of pressure in a die mold to
produce said specific cross-sectional shapes and dimensions.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
said cold-working comprises the step of cold-forming said

needle (10) by stamping said specific cross-sectional shapes and
dimensions into said curved rod element (20). 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
metallic material of said rod element (20) comprises stainless

steel.
