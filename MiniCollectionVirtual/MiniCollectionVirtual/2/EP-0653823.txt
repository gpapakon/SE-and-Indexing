<ABSTRACT>
A VCSEL having a first mirror stack (12) positioned on 
the surface of a substrate (10), an active region (13) 

positioned on the first mirror stack and substantially 
coextensive therewith, and a second mirror stack (14) 

positioned on the active region, the second mirror stack 
forming a ridge or mesa (16) having a side surface (31). A 

metal contact layer (40) is positioned on the side surface 
of the ridge or mesa and on portions of an end of the ridge 

or mesa to define a light emitting area (45), and a layer of 
diamond-like material (50) is electrolytically plated on the 

metal contact layer so as to form a heat conductor to remove 
heat from the laser.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to semiconductor devices
and more specifically to the removal of heat from a
vertical cavity surface emitting laser.In general, semiconductor devices such as vertical
cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) are constructed by
providing a substrate with very smooth surface. A first
stack of mirrors is then grown on the surface by
semiconductor manufacturing techniques. An active area is
grown on the upper surface of the first mirror stack and a
second mirror stack is grown on the upper surface of the
active area. Generally, metal contacts formed of an easily
deposited metal, such as gold, titanium, tungsten, platinum,
or the like, are provided. In general, one metal contact is
provided in contact with the surface of the first (lower)
mirror stack and a second metal contact on the upper surface
of the second mirror stack.One problem that occurs in VCSELs is to contain the
lasing, or optical mode to a lowest order mode and to
contain current flow to approximately the volume of the 
VCSEL in which lasing is occurring. Higher order lasing and
extraneous flow of current outside the lasing area produces
heat in the VCSEL and causes a substantial loss of power.
Ridge, or top emitting mesa shaped, VCSELs are the preferred
implementation over planar VCSELs because of the better
current confinement and optical guiding.In the fabrication of top emitting VCSELs, the
alignment of the top electrical contact to the light
emitting area is very important. Any misalignment of the
electrical contact on the upper surface reduces the
efficiency of the VCSEL. Further, the contact metal
generally covers the sidewall of the mesa as a reflector to
reduce the optical loss and increase efficiency. The
problem is that the metal contacts are not sufficiently
large in area and are generally too thin to effectively
conduct heat generated within the VCSEL away from the VCSEL.
In many instances large and heavy metal heat sinks are
affixed to the VCSEL to absorb the heat. These are
unsatisfactory for a number of reasons: they are large and
bulky, they do not efficiently spread the heat, and the
VCSEL is seldom constructed so that the heat sink can be
positioned in close proximity to the source of the heat.
For example, the heat sink is generally positioned on the
rear surface of the substrate so that only heat traveling
through the substrate, which is generally formed of poor
heat conducting material such as gallium arsenide (GaAs),
reaches the heat sink. A major portion of the heat remains
in the VCSEL.
