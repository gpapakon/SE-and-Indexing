<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel multi-arm block copolymer, a 
novel pressure-sensitive adhesive m
ade from a multi-arm elastomeric block 
copolymer, and a novel tape made therefrom. The multi-arm block copolymer 

has the general structure (A-B)

n
 wherein A, B, C and D are polymer 
segments; Y is a residue of a multifunctional coupling agent; and m and n are 

the number of arms, where m and n are greater than 0 and the sum of m plus n 
is at least 3. A comprises a random copolymer of a monoalkenylarene and a 

conjugated diene; B and C comprise either a homopolymer of a conjugated 
diene or a polymer of two or more conjugated dienes; D comprises either a 

homopolymer of a monoalkenylarene or a copolymer of a monoalkenylarene 
and a conjugated diene wherein the Tg of D is greater than the Tg of A; and 

the weight percent of monoalkenylarene in the block copolymer is 40% or less. 
The pressure-sensitive adhesive of the invention comprises 100 parts by weight 

of either the previously described multi-arm block copolymer or a multi-arm 
block copolymer having the structure (A'-B)
m
Y, about 20 to about 300 parts by 
weight of a tackifying resin, 0 to about 50 parts by weight of a crosslinking 

agent, and 0 to about 200 parts by weight of a plasticizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a multi-arm block copolymer, a
pressure sensitive adhesive formulated from a multi-arm elastomeric block
copolymer, and tape prepared from the adhesive.Pressure sensitive adhesives that are appropriate for use in removable
tape applications require a fourfold balance of peel, tack, adhesion, and
resistance to low stress peel. Especially important is the balance between
adhesion and resistance to low stress peel.Masking tapes provide one example of a removable tape. Masking tapes
are often used in the automotive industry to mask surfaces during painting.
Typically, a masking tape is applied to a surface, exposed to elevated
temperature and/or a chemical environment that often includes organic solvent,
and removed when the tape user has finished the task. The tape must be easy
to apply, stay in place without lifting or curling under conditions of high
temperature and chemical environment, and remove cleanly and easily without
breaking, damaging the surface, or leaving adhesive residue.Pressure sensitive adhesives based on non-thermoplastic hydrocarbon
elastomers such as natural rubber may be readily formulated to provide an
adhesive that meets the requirements of a masking tape. The dominant means
of processing such adhesives involves dissolving the elastomer and other
adhesive components in a hydrocarbon solvent, coating the solution onto a
backing, and drying the coated product to remove the solvent. These solvent-based
processes have become increasingly undesirable, however, because of the
environmental and safety considerations associated with the use of solvents. Environmental and safety considerations have led to accelerated interest
in the use of hot melt extrusion coating of adhesive compositions. The
elastomers typically employed in this technique are "thermoplastic" elastomers
of the block copolymer type, including, for example, styrene-isoprene block
copolymers.Although adhesives based on thermoplastic elastomers eliminate the need
for solvent-based processing, their adhesive properties are different than those
of adhesives based on non-thermoplastic elastomers, and they are not suitable
for some applications. For example, conventional star monoalkenylarene/conjugated
diene block copolymers (such as star styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS)
block copolymers) are generally not suitable for the formulation of removable
adhesives. When formulated to give adhesion in the range desirable for a
removable tape, the adhesive lacks the strength to prevent lifting, and the
