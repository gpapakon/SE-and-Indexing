23; 30; 52; 60; 73) of memory metal from the martensitic into 

the austenitic state, takes place against the direction of 
centrifugal force and the return into the martensitic structure, 

upon reverse transformation of the actuator, takes 
place with centrifugal force reinforcement. 
Centrifuge according to one of the claims 3 to 7, 
characterized

metal from the martensitic into the austenitic state, takes 

place against the force of a restoring spring (36; 66; 79) 
and the return movement, upon reversion of the actuator into 

the martensitic state, takes place with spring force reinforcement.
