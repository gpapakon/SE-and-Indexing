<ABSTRACT>
Safety drive unit, in particular for the movement of
protection screens in manufacturing machines the said unit

comprising at least one drive motor (25, 26) that drives a
support of the motion (7) of an element of cover and/or

protection (5, 205). According to the invention, the
transmission between the drive motor (25, 26) and the

protection screen (5, 205) is formed by a pair of helical
gears (22, 23) engaged between each other with the

corresponding external helical threads (122, 122', 123,
123'), the said helical gears (22, 23) being made in such a

manner, that the rotation of the helical drive gear (23) in
the two directions engages the rotation in the two

directions of the other helical driven gear (22), whereas a
rotation of the driven helical gear (22) engages a locking

underpinning of the same in or with the helical drive gear
(23) which prevents the rotation. The invention relates

also to a protection screen equipped with such a drive
unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a safety drive unit in 
combination with a movable protection screen, 
particularly in manufacturing machines, the said unit 
comprising at least one drive motor connected with the 
protection screen by a mechanical transmission. The use of self-locking helical gears as safety 
drive units is known from the documents EP-A-p 275 418 
and US-A-3 813 958 which however do not disclose the 
use of a self-locking helical gear as a transmission 
for driving a movable protection screen by an 
associated drive motor.  
 The protection screens, in particular in the automatic 
manufacturing machines are at present of great importance for the 
protection against accidents of the operators, as well as 
for the screening of the noise produced by the machines 
themselves. This entails the necessity of constructing 
protection screens as for example guards that are always 
more sturdy, ergonomically integrated with the machine, 
that have to be easily and rapidly moved from the position 
of closure to the one of opening. The attempt to satisfy 
all these requirements has lead to noticeable increase in 
weight and to avoid the use of elements of protection of a 
traditional sash type, for making the same in form of 
covers that can be raised and lowered. According to a preceding application of the  
 
same Applicant (published as EP-A-0 959 008), the 
protection screens are in the form of angled covers or 
angled walls that extend themselves in the closed position 
in such a manner as to cover the front side of the machine 
as well as the top one, thus substantially completely 
separating towards the outside the accessible sides of the 
working units of the machine. For the purpose of obtaining 
a modularity and a movement such as to reduce the 
encumbrances, these protection screens are restrained in a 
moveable manner to a support structure of the machine by 
means of supports in form of an articulated quadrilateral, 
of a substantially trapezoidal shape in particular a 
rectangular trapeze. The protection screens are notably heavy and require 
therefore means that effectively prevent a return of the 
same to the lowered position of closure when they are 
taken to the open position for access to the working units 
of the machine. Obviously it is possible to anticipate the use of 
mechanical locking means that are activated by the 
operators themselves. Once activated these means solve in a 
perfect manner to keep the screens in the open position. 
Never the less the necessity still remains of

manufacturing machines, the said unit comprising at 
least one drive motor (25, 26) connected with the

a) the transmission is a twinworm gear 
transmission formed by a pair of parallel helical 

gears (22, 23), one of them called drive gear (23)

26) and the other called driven gear (22) being 
dynamically connected with the protection screen, and

other with theirs helical threads (122, 122'; 123, 

123') having different pitches, in such a manner, that 
the rotation of the drive gear (23) in the two 

directions causes the rotation in the two directions
