<ABSTRACT>
Injectable microfoam for sclerotherapy. The sclerotherapy of varices is based on the injection of liquid substances capable of 
suppressing them. The present invention relates to the preparation of sclerosing substances in the form of a microfoam. The microfoam 

is prepared with sclerosing agents, and is then injected in the vein to be treated, so that the microfoam displaces the blood contained in 
the vein and provides for the contact of the sclerosing agent with the vascular endothelium, with a predetermined known concentration and 

during a controllable time.

<DESCRIPTION>
Sclerosis of varicose veins is based on the injection into the
veins of liquid substances which, by causing a localized
inflammatory reaction, favours the elimination of these abnormal
veins.When a sclerosing liquid is injected, it is mixed with the blood
contained in the vein and is diluted in an unknown proportion.
The results are uncertain (owing to over- or under-dosage) and are
limited to short varicose segments.As the size of the varicose veins to be injected decreases, this
dilution is less and the results obtained are more predictable.
Nowadays sclerosis is a technique selected in cases of small and
medium varicose veins, those with diameters equal to or greater
than 7 mm being treated by surgery.At present, sclerosis and surgery complement one another but
sclerosis treatment continues not to be applicable to large
varicose veins.In these large varicose veins, if a sclerosing substance is
injected, its concentration in the vein, its homogeneous
distribution in the blood, and the time for which it is in contact
with the internal walls of the vessel treated are not known.In 1946, Orbach injected a few cubic centimetres of air into small
varicose veins and confirmed a displacement of the blood inside
the vessel which was occupied by the injected air. The sclerosing
solution introduced immediately afterwards was more effective than
if it had been injected into the blood. In thick varicose veins, when air is injected the phenomenon
described of the displacement of the blood by the injected air
does not occur but the air forms a bubble inside the vein which
makes the method ineffective in these vessels.The same author had the idea, a few years later, of injecting foam
obtained by agitation of a container containing sodium tetradecyl
sulphate, which is an anionic sclerosing detergent with a good
foaming capability.The method was of little use owing to the large size of the
bubbles formed and was dangerous owing to the side effects of
atmospheric nitrogen which is only slightly soluble in blood.Both methods had limited practical repercussion being used only in
small varicose veins.This invention relates to the preparation of An injectable micro-foam
for therapeutic uses, prepared or for preparation as
required, characterized in that the micro-foam is produced with
any sclerosing substance..According to the present invention, it has been discovered that if
a micro-foam of a pharmacologically inert, sterile, physiological
serum is injected in a horizontal position, the micro-foam causes
displacement of
