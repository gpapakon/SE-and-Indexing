<ABSTRACT>
For dosing powdery bulk material, a device is proposed which comprises a supply container (1) for the bulk material with a closable outlet opening (8) in its lower region and a stirring member which is arranged in the supply container, is attached on one side on the side of a motor and can be driven in rotation. The lower region of the supply container consists of a tube (4) whose free end face (9) containing the outlet opening is inclined relative to the horizontal plain. The stirring member is designed as a bolt shaft (7) and passes through the tube (4). At its free end, the bolt shaft bears an apparatus (11,12) which rests against the end face (9) and can expose or close the outlet opening (8) due to its rotary movement.

An apparatus for proportioning powdered bulk 
material, in particular powdered colorant, comprising a 

reservoir (1) for the bulk material, which in its lower 
region has a sealable outlet port (8) and further comprising 

a rotationally drivable stirring element which is 
located in the reservoir and is clamped unilaterally on 

the side of a motor, wherein the lower region of the 
reservoir (1) comprises a tube (4) whose free end face 

(9) is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane, and 
wherein the stirring element is designed as an axially 

displaceable screw shaft (7) which extends through and 
beyond the tube (4) and at its free end carries a device 

(11, 12), which in the sealing position lies flush 
against the end face (9) and, by virtue of its rotary 

movement, clears or seals the outlet port (8). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
slope of the free end face (9) of the tube (4) with 

respect to the horizontal plane is from about 3° to about 
70°. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reservoir (1) or the screw shaft (7) can be set in 

vibratory motion having a frequency of from 1 to 20 sec
-1
. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
rotational speed of the screw shaft (7) can be varied. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
direction of rotation of the screw shaft (7) can be 

varied. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
device for clearing or sealing the outlet port (8) 

comprises a threaded nut (11) with a retainer (12).
