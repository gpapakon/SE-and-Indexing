<ABSTRACT>
An image communication apparatus includes a 
reception unit for receiving image data, a recording 

unit for recording an image on a sheet on the basis of 
the image data received by the reception unit, a 

storage unit having a plurality of trays for sorting 
and storing sheets on which images are recorded by the 

recording unit, a determination unit for determining 
the presence/absence of the sheets stored in the trays, 

and a controller for sequentially selecting the trays 
with reference to a predetermined tray to sort and 

store the sheets on which the images are recorded by 
the recording unit in the storage unit, and selecting 

the predetermined tray in accordance with a 
determination of the absence of the sheets by the 

determination unit, wherein the determination unit 
determines that no sheet is present in the trays when 

it is detected that the sheet is removed and that no 
sheet is present for a predetermined period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
communication apparatus for storing sheets on which
reception images are recorded in a storage unit.A sorter, or a facsimile or image formation
apparatus having a sorter is known.When a sheet discharged to the bin tray of such a
sorter is removed, a sheet in another bin tray is
sometimes erroneously removed.Since a plurality of bin trays are arranged to
overlap each other, the content of a sheet can be
hardly discriminated while keeping the sheet placed in
the bin tray. To confirm the content of the sheet, a
user removes the sheet from the bin tray.Therefore, the user may return the removed sheet
to the same bin tray again.In a conventional apparatus, this situation is not
taken into consideration, so an erroneous operation may
be performed.It is an object of the present invention to 
prevent erroneous control caused by the above-described
situation. This object is achieved by an apparatus
as set out in the claims.The above and other objects, features, and
advantages of the present invention will be apparent
from the following detailed description of the
preferred embodiments in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing the front
outer appearance of a facsimile apparatus having a
sorter;Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional front view
showing the schematic internal structure of the
facsimile apparatus in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a longitudinal sectional front view of a
facsimile apparatus having no sorter;Fig. 4 is a schematic view showing a film heating
type image heating/fixing unit used in the facsimile
apparatus;Figs. 5A and 5B are an enlarged plan view and a
side view, respectively, showing an operation panel;Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing a bin tray
accommodation frame for a bin unit;Fig. 7 is a longitudinal sectional side view of a
sorter drive unit;Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional plan view of the 
sorter;Fig. 9 is a longitudinal sectional front view of a
bin tray unit;Fig. 10 is a view showing a through sensor portion
near a bin tray;Fig. 11 is a view showing a state in which the bin
tray unit is moved downward to a home position and an
uppermost bin tray is waited at a position corresponding
to a discharge roller pair;Fig. 12 is a view showing a state in which the
second upper bin tray is located at a position
corresponding to the discharge roller pair;Fig. 13 is a view showing a state in which the
sixth upper bin tray is located at a position
corresponding to the discharge roller pair;Fig. 14 is a view showing a state in

<CLAIMS>
A sheet stacking apparatus comprising:

a plurality of stack means (71
2
 to 71
10
) for stacking
sheets received from a device on an upstream side of said

sheet stacking apparatus,
detection means (S6) for detecting sheets on said stack
means, and
determination means

for determining a sheet presence state when said
detection means detects the sheet and a predetermined

time does not pass from a time of changing a state that
said detection means detects the sheet to a state that

said detection means does not detect the sheet and
for determining a sheet absence state when the predetermined
time passes from said changing time,
wherein the received sheets are stacked in a predetermined
stack means (71
1
) in accordance with said detecting
means again detecting a sheet after said determination

means determines the sheet absence state.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a
plurality of said stack means.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said plurality
of the stack means are arranged in a vertical direction.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the sheets
are stacked on each tray by shifting said plurality of said

stack means.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the sheets
stacked on said tray are sorted by said plurality of the

trays.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said sheet
stacking apparatus is a sorter for storing the sheets. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said device
on the upstream side is a facsimile device.
