<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorine containing
diester of an alkyl- or alkylensuccinic acid
which is useful as a surfactant, a lubricant, a releasing
agent, a rust preventive etc. for precision machineries and
components requiring high lubricity. It further relates to a process for preparing said diester
and a magnetic recording medium comprising it.As machines and their components have become small in size
and the high-precision thereof are required, the lubricating manner in
sliding portions thereof is being changed from fluid lubrication to
boundary lubrication. Particularly, in electronic equipments and
components, such as VTR, magnetic disks and the like, the adoption of
ferromagnetic metal thin films to improve recording density requires
a high degree of lubricity for the sliding between a magnetic tape or
disk and a magnetic head.For example, in depositon recording tapes film and hard disks,
the lubricant layer on a magnetic layer surface is formed in such a
way that it has a thickness as low as scores of angstrom in order to
minimize spacing loss between the magnetic recording medium and the
magnetic head to provide high power output while ensuring durability
and reliability. Therefore, it is a crucial problem to develop organic
compounds excellent in lubricity as a material which forms the
lubricating agent layer. As the lubricant for a metal thin film-type magnetic
recording medium, a fluoroalkyl group containing ester of an aliphatic
carboxylic acid, for example, a compound having the formula:

a compound having the general formula:

wherein R4 represents an alkyl group, and R5 and R6 independently
represent a fluoroalkyl group or alkyl group,
and a nonionic surfactant containing perfluoroalkenyl group having the
general formula
CpF2p-1O(CqH2qO)rR7
wherein R7 represents hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted
hydrocarbon group, or a substituted or unsubstituted acyl group, p is an
integer from 3 to 18, q is 2 or 3 and r is an integer from 3 to 25,
are proposed since they have an excellent compatibility with metal
thin film (see Japanese Patent Kokai Nos. 148413/1990, 291185/1991
and 183607/1988).However, the lubricant comprising the fluoroalkyl group
containing ester of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having the formula (A)
or (B) or the nonionic surfactant containing perfluoroalkenyl group 
having the formula (C) has the problem that lubricity is decreased under high humidity
environment.EP-A-0 473 871 discloses a fluorine-containing carboxylic acid which can be utilized in
magnetic
