<ABSTRACT>
In a shoe, at least one upper part (2) is connected to a sole (1) or midsole via an edge seam (4), for which corresponding holes are provided in the parts (1, 2) to be connected for pulling through the twine (6) or the like, and in which the twine (6) is guided through each hole (5) and along one seam outside in each case twice (12) but on the other seam outside only singly (7), the seam (4) is made as a crochet seam, in which stitch loops (12) reaching from each hole (5) to the next hole are formed on one seam side, the twine (7, 10) is brought singly from the previous hole on the other seam side and introduced into the hole, is guided through the same hole, running back from the stitch loop (12), to the next hole, and in which the two twine pieces (10, 11) forming the stitch (12) are, at the hole (5), guided through the stitch loop (12) brought from the previous hole.

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a shoe, wherein at least 
one upper (2) is joined to a sole (1) or intermediate 

sole via a hand-made edge seam (4), for which 
coinciding prefabricated holes (5) for the passage of 

the thread (6) are provided in the parts (1, 2) for 
joining, and wherein the thread (6) is taken twice (12) 

in each case through each hole (5) and along one seam 
outside, but only once (7) at the other seam outside, 

characterised in that the seam (4) is constructed as a 
crochet seam, in which, on one seam side, loops (12) 

are formed which extend from each hole (5) to the next 
hole, the thread (7, 10) is brought to the other seam 

side once from the previous hole and introduced into 
the hole, is taken through the same hole back from the 

loop (12) to the next hole, and wherein the two thread 
portions (10, 11) forming the loop (12) are passed, at 

the hole (5) through the loop (12) brought from the 
previous hole. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the seam (4) is made with a tool (8) in the 

form of a crochet needle having an ergonometrically 
favourable handle.
