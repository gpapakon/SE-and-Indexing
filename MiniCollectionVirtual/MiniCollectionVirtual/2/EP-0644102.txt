<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for guiding a road vehicle which is provided for use in the provision of services and the removal of waste and which permits the use of utility vehicles in small, narrow traffic areas and on traffic routes which have poor visibility and are susceptible to accidents, the vehicle travelling through in particular with precise steering and driving manoeuvres which permit it to drive around obstacles in the way without colliding with them and without danger. According to the invention the object is achieved in that the all-wheel steering is deactivated or restricted and the degree of restriction of the steering depends on the position of the vehicle with respect to reference points past which the vehicle is driven, in that the position of the vehicle with respect to the reference points, such as a kerbstone, tree in a street etc. or a parked vehicle is measured and evaluated by means of a measurement sensor with mechanical, electrical or electronic operation, the distance and the relationship between the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and the reference point being identified and evaluated and after an angular position of the longitudinal centre axis and a distance of the vehicle to the reference point which is changed therewith have been reached, the all-wheel steering is set in such a way that during the movement of the vehicle the swivelled-in rear wheel is positioned, and held in position, directly as it moves past the reference point.

A method for preventing collisions of an all-wheel steered road vehicle
travelling in small traffic areas or narrow traffic spaces of supply and disposal

areas with obstacles, as e.g. kerb stones, road trees or parking vehicles, by
measuring, with sensors that are designed to be mounted on the vehicle, the

distance of the vehicle and the position of its longitudinal axis from and in
relation to the obstacles that serve as places of reference, and evaluating the

results in a computer for interference into the rear wheels steering,


characterised by the fact that
 the distance of the vehicle and its position in
relation to the places of reference is measured by mechanical sensors extending

out from the vehicle and keeping it on distance by swinging out and flexibly
sliding over the places of reference, and that in the event that the longitudinal

axis is in a position parallel to the place of reference the rear wheels of the
vehicle are adjusted for swinging around at a distance to the place of reference

at which the vehicle's rear wheel rolls along the place of reference in a steering
radius that passes the place of reference; in the event that the longitudinal axis is

not parallel to the place of reference, the rear wheels are steered when the rear
wheel is in the minimum distance to the place of reference with the steering

process which starts with the swinging around of the rear wheels of the all-wheel
steering system steadily continuing with increasing distances once the

minimum distance is exceeded and the rear wheels being prevented from
swinging into the direction of the place of reference once the distance of the

rear axle to the place of reference has fallen short a fixed minimum.
A method as defined in Claim 1, 
characterised by the fact
 that in the event of
the sensor's detection of an obstacle during the travelling of the vehicle in a

continuous direction the proportionally adjusted steering motion of the all-wheel
steering system is stopped, once the said continuous travelling direction has

been left, by cutting the coupling between the steering motion of the front and
the rear wheels and keeping the wheels of the rear axle in the position in which

they were at the time of the detection of the obstacle until such obstacle has
been passed, and then being moved into a proportionally adjusted steering 

relation; coupled again to the front axle.
A method as defined in Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 obstacles are detected on both
sides of he vehicle with the aid of sensors operating on the right-hand and left-hand

sides of he vehicle, and are reported to the computer for adjusting the all-wheel
steering system for driving around the obstacle.
A method as defined in Claim 3, 
characterised by the fact
 that in the event of
travelling around a curve with the wheels of both axles of the all-wheel steering

system being steered out and the angle of the steering lock of the front wheels
being wider than that of the rear wheels, the sensor which is operating at the

outer side of the curve radius stops operating and re-starts operation after the
completion of curve driving.
A method as defined in one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the fact
 that
in the event of early detection of an obstacle by the driver the said driver may

interfere into the automatic steering system by manually switching off the
proportionally adjusted steering motion of the all-wheel steering system, and the

wheels of the rear axle remain in the position to which they were adjusted when
the obstacle was detected, later being moved into a proportionally adjusted

steering relation, coupled again to the wheels of the front axle.
A method as defined in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by the fact
 that
in the event of stop of operation of the sensors the rear wheels of the vehicle are

moved into a central position and locked therein.
An apparatus for influencing the steering system of an all-wheel steered vehicle
(1) with the aid of swing-out sensors that are mounted on the frame of the

vehicle (4) by which the vehicle (1) is steerable in a way that is safe and avoids
collisions with obstacles in situations of active or standstill traffic during

operation, using its working aggregates (5; 8), in small, limited traffic areas,
especially in parking spaces that are limited by kerbs and parking vehicles or

other areas with traffic limitations, with sensors (16; 16') being arranged at
measurement spots on the vehicle (1) which sensors, targeted to sensor points 

(17; 17'), form measurement distances (s) and pass the data of the vehicle's
position which have been collected from the measurement distances (s) to a

board computer which is connected to an adjusting mechanism of the rear
wheels (3) of the all-wheel steering system for conducting a steering process of

these wheels, 
wherein
 the swing-out sensors are working aggregates (5, 8) of
the vehicle, and sensors (16; 16') and sensor points (17; 17') are arranged on

instruments (11; 12) for operating these working aggregates, and the data
established by the said sensors (16; 16') and passed to the board computer result

from the alterations of the measurement distances (s; s') that are caused by the
swinging-out and -in of the vehicle's (1) working aggregates (5; 8) which slide

over the boundaries (13) of the traffic area so that the steering process of the
rear wheels (3) towards the boundaries (13) is blocked when the measured

distance (s) between the sensors (16; 16') and the sensor points (17; 17') falls
below a fixed minimum.
An apparatus as defined in Claim 7, 
wherein
 the sensors (16; 16') and sensor
points (17; 17') are arranged on hydraulically operated working aggregates (5;

8).
An apparatus as defined in Claim 8, 
wherein
 the sensors (16; 16') are placed on
adjusting cylinders (11; 12) for the hydraulic operation of the working

aggregates, and the sensor points (17; 17') are arranged on piston rods
attributed to the adjusting cylinders (11; 12) and coupled to a gear (7; 7') which

supports the respective working aggregate.
An apparatus as defined in Claims 8 or 9, 
wherein
 the two sensors (16; 16')
are arranged on the adjusting cylinders (11; 12), and the sensor points (17; 17')

are arranged on the piston rods attributed to the adjusting cylinders (11; 12) for
operating the suction shaft (8) and the disk brush (5).
