<ABSTRACT>
A blood collection bag assembly (10) is provided. The assembly includes a flexible
blood collection bag (16), a length of flexible tubing extending from and communicating with

the bag and a connector secured to the end of the flexible tubing remote from the bag.
The connector includes a needle pierceable resealable closure secured in sealing

engagement with the end of the flexible tubing remote from the bag. The connector can
be used with a conventional needle holder (12,18), such as the type used to collect specimens of

blood into an evacuated tube. The blood collection bag assembly has no sharp
components, and hence is safe and easy to use. Additionally, the blood collection bag

assembly can be used with conventional evacuated tubes (14) to avoid cut and drip techniques
for collecting specimens of blood for analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collection, storage, transporting and sampling system for fluids. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system for collecting, storing, transporting and sampling blood.A conventional blood collection bag assembly includes a bag pre-filled with an anticoagulant solution and a length of plastic tubing extending therefrom with a needle mounted to the end of the tubing remote from the bag. The bag is used to collect blood or donated blood for medical use.Medical professionals will employ a "cut and drip technique" or a "stab" technique to collect a small sample of the donated blood for laboratory analysis to assure safety of the blood in the bag and to identify characteristics of the blood such as ABO group and the Rh type. These techniques allow the medical professional to collect a sample from the bag while maintaining the integrity and sterility of the bag and blood sample.To perform the "cut and drip" technique with a blood bag, any packaging cover that had been mounted to the needle is removed, and the pointed distal end of the needle is inserted into a blood vessel of the patient or donor to generate a flow of blood through the tubing and into the bag. After a sufficient volume of blood has been collected, the tubing is clamped at two locations to prevent further flow of blood. The tubing then is cut or separated between the clamps. The removal of the clamp closest to the bag causes blood in the severed section of tubing to flow into the bag. The cut section of tube then is recapped, and the blood bag is stored and/or used. The clamp then is removed from the remaining section of tubing. Blood that had remained in the tubing between the clamp and the needle is enabled to flow into one or more blood collection tubes. The blood collection tubes then are sealed, labeled and shipped to a laboratory for analysis. The needle is removed from the patient and discarded along with the section of tubing connected thereto.Blood collection bag assemblies that have the cut and drip technique have the presence of the needle on the end of the tubing remote from the blood collection bag which may create a risk to the donor, patient and medical professional. Additionally, the above-described assembly is in communication with the ambient environment for at least a short period of time. Hence, the potential exists for contamination of the interior of the blood collection bag, and such contamination can affect the safety and utility of the entire assembly. Similarly, the

A blood collection bag assembly (16) comprising

a flexible bag (50) for collecting a volume of blood,
flexible tubing (58) extending from and communicating with the bag (50), the flexible tubing (58) having an end (60) remote from the bag (50),
a connector (162) secured to said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) remote from said bag (50), said connector (162) comprising a needle pierceable resealable closure(166) sealingly engaged with said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58), and
a cap (168), said cap (168) comprising a cylindrical sidewall (170) surrounding said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) and an annular end wall (172) extending inwardly from said cylindrical sidewall (170), said annular end wall (172) securely engaging said closure (166) for sealing said flexible tubing (58),

wherein the connector (162.)- includes an inner fitting (164) supportingly engaged within said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) remote from said bag (50), said fitting (164) preventing said flexible tubing (58) from collapsing,
characterized in that
 t
the tubing (58) is effectively squeezed between said inner fitting (164) and said cylindrical sidewall (170) of said cap (168), thereby
 facilitating secure engagement of said closure (166) with the flexible tubing (58).
The blood collection bag assembly (16) of Claim 1, wherein the inner fitting (164) and the cap (168) are separate from one another, said cylindrical sidewall (170) of said cap (168) being forcibly engaged over said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) for securely gripping said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) between said cylindrical sidewall (170) and said inner fitting (164).
The blood collection bag assembly (16) of Claim 2, wherein said closure (166) has opposed parallel planar surfaces, one said surface of said closure (166) being sealingly engaged by said annular end wall (172) of said cap (168), said opposed surface of said closure(166) being sealingly engaged against said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) and against said fitting (164).
The blood collection bag assembly (16) of one of Claims 1-3, wherein the end wall (172) tightly retains the closure (166) against said end (60) of the flexible tubing.
A blood collection bag assembly (16) comprising

a flexible bag (50) for collecting a volume of blood,
flexible tubing (58) extending from and communicating with the bag (50), the flexible tubing (58) having an end (60) remote from the bag (50), and
a connector (62) secured to said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) remote from said bag (50), said connector (62) comprising a
 needle pierceable resealable closure (86) sealingly engaged with said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58),
characterized in that

said connector (62) includes a generally tubular support (76), having a first end (78) with concentric spaced apart inner (80) and outer (82) walls securely engaging said end (60) of said flexible tubing (58) therebetween, said support (76) further having a second end (84), said closure (86) being securely engaged in said second end (84) of said support (76) and having a portion defining a cross-section greater than the support (76), said connector (62) further comprising an outer cap (64), said outer cap (64) having a cylindrical wall telescoped (70) over at least said second end (84) of said inner support (76) and sealingly engaged with portions of said closure(86), said cap (64) of said connector (62) further including an annular end wall (72) extending inwardly and overlying portions of said closure (86).
