<ABSTRACT>
A protective circuit is used in conjunction with a 
switching power source (110) for protecting the latter from 

overload and from short circuits. The circuit detects 
whether the current at the primary winding current of a 

switching power source transformer (114), the load current 
of the switching power source, or both exceed a predetermined 

reference voltage. If so, supply of power to the 
switching power source (110) is interrupted for a predetermined 

period of time, thereby bringing the switching 
power source into inoperable condition for the duration of 

the predetermined period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for
protecting a switching power source from an overload condition
or a short circuit condition by detecting a load current
of the switching power source or a current flowing in the
primary winding of a transformer included in the switching
power source.Recently, switching power sources have been commonly
brought into use because they are a highly efficient means
for providing a stable power supply. There are many types of
switching power sources. As described in "Transistor
Technology Special No. 28", the switching power sources are
classified as single type vs. push-pull types and as self-excited
types vs. separate-excited types in terms of power
transistor's circuit configuration. To attain stabilized
control, PWM types, RCC types or the like are used.Generally, these circuits are designed to have
protective characteristics for protecting the power transistor
or the power FET coupled to the transformer from being
damaged when a switching power source is overloaded or when
the output of the circuit is short circuited.A protective circuit for protecting from the overload
condition or the short circuit condition is described in
Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-57 212 825,
wherein
with respect to a switching power source with a PWM feedback
control, a current flowing in a power transistor or a power
FET is interrupted using a bistable multivibrator when an
overcurrent flows in the load for a predetermined period of
time.In the protective circuit as described in the above
publication, once an overcurrent is detected, the bistable
multivibrator is set so that current does not flow in the
power transistor or the power FET. Even after the
overcurrent stops flowing, the protected component, that is,
the power transistor or power FET will remain OFF until the 
protective circuit is manually re-set. Because there is no
automatic re-set function, the protective circuit is very
troublesome to use. In addition, an over current
condition is not detected unless it continues for the
predetermined period of time. Therefore, response is slow
for detecting continuous short circuits. Also, the
circuit has many components and is therefore complicated
and expensive to produce.According to a first aspect of this invention a
protective circuit adapted
for a switching power source which
includes switching means for switching an input voltage
applied to said switching means, a transformer having a
primary winding coupled to said switching means and a
secondary winding, and rectifying
