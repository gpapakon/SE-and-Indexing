<ABSTRACT>
An anchoring element has a shaft (2) destined to be anchored in a bone and a head (3) with a substantially U-shaped cross section that may be coupled to a rod (10). The bottom (5) of the U-shaped cross section is linked to the shaft (2), and two free branches (6, 7) form a channel (4) for receiving the rod (10). The free branches (6, 7) have an inner thread (8) which extends in the direction of the branches. A fixing element (11) and an element (12) that outwardly encloses the branches are provided. In order to allow not only straight rods, but also bent rods to be received, and thus to adapt the anchoring element to the individual characteristics of the vertebral column to be treated, the free branches have an outer thread (9) and the element (12) has an inner thread which cooperates therewith. The fixing element (11) has a thread which can be screwed into the inner thread (8). The bottom (5) of the U-shaped recess (4) is provided with a vaulted section (20). The bottom (5) of the U-shaped recess (4) is provided with a vaulted section (20).

<CLAIMS>
Anchoring member with a shaft (2, 16) to be fastened to a 
bone and a head (3) for connection with a rod (10, 15), 

the head having a substantially U-shaped cross-section which 
has its base (5) connected to the shaft (2, 16) and comprises 

two free legs (6, 7) defining a channel for receiving the rod 
(10, 15)
 
wherein the legs (6, 7) comprise an internal thread (8) and an 

external thread (9),
 
and with a member (12) embracing the legs (6, 7) at their outer 

side and having an internal thread cooperating with the 
external thread, and with a fastening member (11) having a 

thread cooperation with the internal thread (8) of the legs,
 
characterized in that the base (5) of the U-shaped recess (4) 

has a curved portion in a direction perpendicular to the U-shaped 
cross-section and that the member (12) is formed as a 

nut having two open rides. 
Anchoring member according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the rims (18, 19) of the base (5) are 

formed to slope outwardly downwards towards the shaft (2, 
16). 
Anchoring member according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a recess (17) is provided in the base 

(5) of the channel coaxial to the first internal thread 
(8). 
Anchoring member according to any of the claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the curvature comprises a depressed 

portion towards the center. 
Anchoring member according to claim 4,
 
characterized in that the curvature comprises a respective  

 
projecting cambered portion (21, 22) spaced from the 

center. 
Anchoring member according to claim 4,
 
characterized in that the spacing of a cambered portion 

(21, 22) substantially corresponds to the center (23) 
between the radius of the internal thread (8) and that of 

the external thread (11).
