<ABSTRACT>
The sheet (2) has, on one of its faces in a predetermined limited zone of the said face, a piece (3) having the shape of a perforated leaf or of a grating (3) made of a second metal or alloy which is harder than that of the sheet (2), the said piece (3) being fastened to the sheet (2) by cold forming, so that the metal of the sheet (2) penetrates the openings (6) in the piece (3). Use especially for vehicles and buildings.

<CLAIMS>
A structural element (1; 16; 60), more 
particularly for a vehicle, comprising a plate (2; 30) 

made of a first relatively light and soft metal or 
alloy, characterised in that the plate (2; 30) has, on 

one of its surfaces, in a predetermined limited zone of 
said surface, a part (3; 17; 35) in the form of a 

perforate sheet (45) or grid (3) made from a second 
metal or alloy harder than that of the plate (2; 30), 

the said part (3; 17, 22, 23, 24, 25; 31, 32, 33, 34, 
35) being fixed to the plate (2; 30) by cold die-stamping 

so that the metal of the plate (2; 30) 
penetrates into the apertures (6; 46) of the part (3; 

17, 22, 23, 24, 25; 31, 32, 33, 34, 35). 
An element according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one portion (12, 13, 14, 15; 22, 23, 24, 

25, 26, 27, 28) of the part (3; 17) has a perforation 
density less than other portions of the part. 
An element according to any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the part has at least one 

recessed portion (11; 42). 
An element according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the plate (2; 30) has at least 

two of the said parts, said parts being fixed on the 
same surface of the plate (2; 30). 
An element according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the plate (2; 30) has at least  

 
two of said parts, said parts being fixed on different 

surfaces of the plate. 
An element according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the first metal is aluminium. 
An element according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the second metal is steel. 
A method of improving the properties of a 
structural element (1; 16; 60), more particularly for a 

vehicle, comprising a plate (2; 30; 50) made of a first 
relatively light and soft metal or alloy, characterised 

in that it comprises a step wherein a part (3; 17, 22, 
23, 24, 25; 31, 32, 33, 34, 35; 53) in the form of a 

perforate sheet (45) or a grid (3) made of a second 
metal or alloy harder than that of the plate (2; 30; 

50) is fixed in a predetermined limited zone of one of 
the surfaces of the plate (2; 30; 50), said fixi
ng 
being effected by cold die-stamping so that the metal 

of the plate (2; 30; 50) penetrates into the apertures 
(6; 46) of the part. 
A method according to claim 8, the plate (50) 
undergoing a die-stamping operation to give it a 

predetermined shape, characterised in that fixing of 
the part (53) takes place during the said die-stamping 

operation. 
A method according to claim 8 or 9, characterised 
in that at least two of the said parts are fixed on the 

plate, said parts being separated from one another.
