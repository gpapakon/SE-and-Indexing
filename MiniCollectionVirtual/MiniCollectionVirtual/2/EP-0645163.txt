<ABSTRACT>
A positive pressure demand valve for breathing apparatus 
incorporates a tubular "balanced piston" valve member 6 

for regulating the flow of breathing gas from an inlet 2 
to an outlet 15. A coaxial tension spring 18 acts to 

bias the valve member open and a lever 25 coupled to a 
pressure-responsive diaphragm 20 acts to push the valve 

member closed when a predetermined pressure is attained 
within the outlet. A combined pressure-relief and 

bypass valve member 13 enables the operation of the main 
valve member 6 to be bypassed by porting gas through the 

centre 9 of the main valve seat 8. A "first breath" 
mechanism is provided comprising a hooked link 17 which 

can be pressed in by a button 36 to maintain the main 
valve member closed and can be released by contact by the 

diaphragm 20 when a negative pressure is applied to the 
outlet 15. The outlet is in the form of a bayonet 

connector which is locked into a corresponding inlet 
fitting on the user's mask by means of the same button 

36.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas flow control valves
and more particularly to demand valves for breathing
apparatus.The invention is concerned with a valve incorporating a
so-called "balanced piston" valve member, which is
characterised by low operating forces and an ability to
operate consistently over a range of supply pressures.
Such a valve for use in underwater diving equipment is
described and illustrated schematically in US-A-3647175.
Another example for underwater use, having the features
recited in the preamble of claim 1 hereof, is known from
US-A-4224938. It is an aim of the present invention to
adapt this principle to use in a "positive pressure"
demand valve of compact construction and efficient
operation.Accordingly, the invention resides in a demand valve for
breathing apparatus comprising: an inlet chamber for
connection to a source of pressurised gas; an outlet
chamber to lead gas to the user's respiratory organs; a
movable valve member for controlling the flow of gas from
the inlet chamber to the outlet chamber; and a flexible
pressure-responsive member sensitive to the gas pressure
within the outlet chamber for controlling the movement of
the valve member; the valve member being an axially-slidable
member of tubular form, one end of which extends
into the inlet chamber, the other end of which leads to
the outlet chamber, and the interior of which defines a
flow path to lead gas from the inlet chamber to the
outlet chamber; a valve seat facing the valve member in
the inlet chamber such that the spacing of the valve
member from said seat controls the rate of gas flow
through the valve member from the inlet chamber to the
outlet chamber and contact of the valve member with said
seat shuts off such flow; spring means acting upon the 
valve member; the pressure-responsive member being
arranged to flex in one sense in response to reducing gas
pressure in said outlet chamber and to flex in the
opposite sense in response to increasing gas pressure in
said outlet chamber; the axis of flexure of the
pressure-responsive member being inclined to the axis of
the valve member; and mechanical linkage means being
provided to link the pressure-responsive member to the
valve member; characterised in that said spring means
act upon the valve member to bias the same away from said
seat, the pressure-responsive member is connected to
transmit movement to said linkage means in said opposite
sense of its flexure and the linkage means is connected
to transmit movement to the valve member in the closing
di

pressurised gas; an outlet chamber (14,15) to lead gas
to the user's respiratory organs; a movable valve member

(6) for controlling the flow of gas from the inlet
chamber (4) to the outlet chamber (14,15); and a

flexible pressure-responsive member (20) sensitive to the
gas pressure within the outlet chamber (14,15) for

controlling the movement of the valve member (6); the
valve member (6) being an axially-slidable member of

tubular form, one end of which extends into the inlet
chamber (4), the other end of which leads to the outlet

chamber (14,15), and the interior of which defines a flow
path to lead gas from the inlet chamber (4) to the outlet

chamber (14,15); a valve seat (8) facing the valve
member (6) in the inlet chamber (4) such that the spacing

of the valve member (6) from said seat (8) controls the
rate of gas flow through the valve member (6) from the

inlet chamber (4) to the outlet chamber (14,15) and
contact of the valve member (6) with said seat (8) shuts

off such flow; spring means (18) acting upon the valve
member (6); the pressure-responsive member (20) being

arranged to flex in one sense in response to reducing gas
pressure in said outlet chamber (14,15) and to flex in

the opposite sense in response to increasing gas pressure
in said outlet chamber (14,15); the axis of flexure of

the pressure-responsive member (20) being inclined to the
axis of the valve member (6); and mechanical linkage

means (25) being provided to link the pressure-responsive
member (20) to the valve member (6); characterised in

that said spring means (18) act upon the valve member (6)
to bias the same away from said seat (8), the pressure-responsive

member (20) is connected to transmit movement
to said linkage means (25) in said opposite sense of its

flexure and the linkage means (25) is connected to
transmit movement to the valve member (6) in the closing

direction thereof; whereby reducing gas pressure within
the outlet chamber (14,15) permits the valve member (6) 

to move away from said seat (8) under the bias of said
spring means (18) while increasing gas pressure within

the outlet chamber (14,15) causes the pressure-responsive
member (20) to move the mechanical linkage means (25) to

move the valve member (6) towards said seat (8) against
the bias of said spring means (18); whereby in normal

operation a super-ambient pressure is maintained within
said outlet chamber (14,15) throughout the respiratory

cycle of the user.
A valve according to claim 1 wherein said spring
means comprises a tension spring (8) linked coaxially

between said other end of the valve member (6) and a
fixed part (19) of the valve structure.
