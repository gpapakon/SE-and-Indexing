<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for melting copper without incorporating unwanted oxygen and/or hydrogen into the copper by effectively controlling the burners (16) used to melt the copper within desired fuel/air ratio operating limits by employing a special fuel/air mixture sampling and control system (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
controlling the operation of a burner and, more
particularly, to controlling the fuel/air ratio of
burners used to melt copper to avoid incorporating
unwanted oxygen and/or hydrogen into the copper.The melting of copper is a very important
commercial process. As is well-known in the art and as
discussed in U.S. Patent No. 3,199,977 issued to A. J.
Phillips et al. on August 10, 1965,
copper cathodes are
the predominant form of copper produced industrially
and the cathodes are generally flat rectangular shapes
about one inch thick by about 25 inches to 40 inches,
although larger or smaller sizes may be produced.Although the cathodically deposited copper
is commercially pure except for the usual impurities
and unavoidable minor amounts of electrolyte
(sulphates) physically present on the surface of the
cathodes or occluded therein, the copper cathodes
generally are not used per se because of their shape
and physical properties, especially the grain structure
of the deposited copper. To place them in more useful
form, the cathodes must be melted and the molten metal
cast into one or more semi-finished forms--for example,
cakes, ingots, bars such as wire bars, billets and rods 
and similar shapes from which finished products are
produced, such as for example, sheets, wire, tubes and
the many other commercial products fabricated of
commercially pure copper. However, it is important
that the copper not become contaminated with
commercially unacceptable amounts of oxygen and sulphur
during the melting since from a commercial standpoint
the melted copper is essentially ruined and must be
reprocessed through a series of steps to form a new
cathode. This is a costly and time consuming
procedure.It is essential therefore, that the burners
used to melt the copper not contaminate the copper
with, for example, unwanted oxygen. In general, the
fuel/oxygen (air) mixture is proportioned to contain
insufficient oxygen to completely burn the fuel and the
resulting melting flame is a reducing flame. For most
industrial uses, the predetermined reducing conditions
should be such that any oxygen incorporated into the
copper is less than .05% by weight of the copper during
the melting. Preferably, the predetermined reducing
conditions are such that less than .035% and most
preferably less than .01% by weight of oxygen are
incorporated into the molten copper.The burners described in US-A-3 199 977
and U.S. Patent No. 4,536,152
were specially designed to provide a high degree
of fuel/air

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the fuel/air ratio for
each burner in a multiple burner system comprising


(a) predetermining for each burner a set-point
amount for a desired substance which is a componen
t of fuel
or air,
(b) sampling for analysis a portion of one of the
burner's mixture of said fuel and air to be burned,
(c) analyzing the sampled mixture of fuel and air
to measure the amount of said substance in said sample,
(d) comparing the measured amount of said
substance with the predetermined set-point amount desired

for the sampled burner, and
(e) changing, if necessary, the amount of fuel or
air for the sampled burner, characterized in that the step

(b) sampling includes continuously drawing a portion of the
mixture of fuel and air, for each of all of the burners

through separate respective channels into a manifold, and
periodically repeating the steps (b)-(e) for a different one

of the burners so as to continuously carry out the steps
(b)-(e) for the multiple burner system during use of the

burners.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the substance of the fuel includes hydrogen.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the amounts of the fuel or air are changed by using

a motorized bleed valve to adjust the amount of the fuel or
air flowing to the burners in the multiple burner system.
A method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the step (b) sampling includes

channeling each burner's fuel-air mixture into a distinct
three way valve associated with the respective said burner,

each said three way valve having a first output port coupled
to said manifold and a second output port coupled to where

the step (c) analyzing is carried out.
A method according to claim 4, characterized in
that the steps (b)-(e) are repeated for a different one of 

the burners by closing said first output port and opening
said second output port of said three way valve to permit

said mixture of a selected said burner to be analyzed, and
opening said first output port and closing said second

output port for all other said three way valves.
A method according to claim 7, characterized in
that the steps (b)-(e) are periodically repeated by

selectively varying which said three way valve has its
second output port open while all other said three way

valves have their first output ports open to vary which said
mixture of said burner is selected for steps (b)-(e).
The use of the method according to any one of the
preceding claims with a shaft furnace having a row of the

burners around a periphery of the furnace.
The use of the method according to claim 7,
wherein the furnace is used to melt copper.
