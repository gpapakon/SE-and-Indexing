<ABSTRACT>
The filling of a cigarette (3) under observation 
is controlled by intersecting the open-end surface (14) 

of the cigarette (3) with at least one coherent light 
blade (9) emitted by at least one laser source (4), to 

form a respective real light trace (15), and by 

analyzing any deviation or discontinuity of the real 
trace (15) in relation to a theoretical, straight, 

continuous trace (13) formed by joining two end points 
(B, C) of the real trace (15), to obtain a signal 

indicating acceptance or rejection of the cigarette (3) 
under observation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cigarette filling
optical control method.More specifically, the present invention relates
to a control method for determining the presence or
absence of tobacco at the open end of cigarettes on a
cigarette manufacturing machine and/or filter assembly
machine and/or packing machine.At the output of a cigarette manufacturing
machine and/or filter assembly machine and/or at the
input of a packing machine, the cigarettes are normally
subjected to numerous checks comprising a check of
the filling to determine the presence or absence of
tobacco at the open end of the cigarettes.In most cases, filling control consists in illuminating
the front surface of the open end of the cigarette
by means of a light source; forming an image of the front
surface by means of a detecting unit featuring a telecamera
or equivalent optical monitoring system; and
transmitting the image to a comparing unit for comparing
it with a specimen image and emitting a reject signal
in the event the detected and specimen images differ
over and above a given limit.In general, the difference in the detected and
specimen images depends on differences in shading
which, as is known, varies according to the presence of
gaps on the front surface due to the absence of tobacco.
Unfortunately, the shading of the detected image has
been found to depend largely, not only on the presence
of gaps, but also on the colour of the tobacco employed,
so that known devices of the above type involve expensive,
time-consuming setup procedures whenever the
type of tobacco is changed.Known devices of the types described above
are known from GB-A-2,176,598 and EP-A-370,231.In GB-A-2, 176,598 is shown a devices wherein
a bundle of optical fibers, which are divided in two
branches. One branch is connected to a source and is
distributed so as to invest the cigarette end along a
given path, and the other branch has a similar distribution
and is connected to a detecting sensor.In EP-A-370,231 is shown a device wherein a
coherent light beam impinges upon the cigarettes end
along a linear path, and a sensor detects the reflected
light along said linear path.The known apparatuses of the type described
above are based on the principle of measuring the
intensity of the reflected brightness, which depends
upon the presence of gaps in the cigarette end, and the
colour of the tobacco.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a straightforward, low-cost optical control method
designed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks.According
