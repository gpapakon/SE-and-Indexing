<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for the expression of recombinant molecules in bacterial hosts in a defined medium in the absence of antibiotic selection. The method uses an expression vector comprising a regulatable promoter by which the production of foreign proteins may be controlled during the growth phase of the culture, an origin of replication maintaining medium vector copy number and a transcriptional terminator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the expression of recombinant 
antibody genes in bacterial host cells in a defined medium in the absence of 
antibiotic selection. The rapid developments in recombinant DNA techniques have resulted in 
the identification and isolation of many novel genes, some of known 
function and some of unknown function. Invariably there is a need to 
express the gene in a heterologous cell system in order to produce material 
for structure-function studies, diagnostic reagents such as monoclonal or 
polyclonal antibodies and material for in vivo activity testing and therapy. Several alternative systems for the expression of foreign genes have been 
developed including systems based upon mammalian cells, insect cells, 
fungal cells, bacterial cells and transgenic animals or plants. The choice of 
expression system for a given gene depends upon the likely features of the 
encoded protein, for example any post-translational protein modifications 
needed for biological activity, as well as the objective of the study. Other 
important considerations for the investigator are the facilities available, time 
and cost involved in generating the amounts or recombinant protein 
required. The most widely used and convenient system for the production of foreign 
proteins remains that based on the prokaryote Escherichia coli. The 
advantages of this system comprise the ease of gene manipulation, the 
availability of reagents including gene expression vectors, the ease of 
producing quantities of protein (up to a gramme in simple shake-flask 
culture), speed and the high adaptability of the system to express a wide 
variety of proteins.  
 Expression of any foreign gene in E. coli begins with the insertion of a 
cDNA copy of the gene into an expression vector. Many forms of 
expression vector are available. Such vectors usually comprise a plasmid 
origin of DNA replication, an antibiotic selectable marker and a promoter 
and transcriptional terminator separated by a multi-cloning site (expression 
cassette) and a DNA sequence encoding a ribosome binding site. The 
method of transcriptional regulation varies between the various promoters 
now available (ptac, λpL, T7). The ptac and T7 expression based systems 
are controlled by the chemical inducer IPTG, whilst the λ promoters are 
controlled by a temperature switch. A problem encountered with E. coli based expression systems is the 
difficulty of producing material which is acceptable for therapeutic use. The 
use of complex media,
