<ABSTRACT>
To dry cheese, the simultaneous application of vacuum and passing through dehumidified air is proposed. Drying is carried out in at least one drying tunnel (4), the cheese being introduced and removed via locks or sealing doors (3). The drying air is removed by suction via lines (10, 11, 12), dehumidified, sterilised and returned to the drying tunnel via lines (18, 20, 21, 22).

A process for drying cheeses (2) with air, wherein the
cheeses (2) are conducted through a drying tunnel (4) by aid

of a conveying means, air is sucked off the drying tunnel (4)
while maintaining a negative pressure, and the sucked-off air

is dried and returned to the drying tunnel (4) while
maintaining the negative pressure.
A device for carrying out the process according to claim 1,
characterized by a drying tunnel (4) through which a conveying

means passes and which comprises a sealingly closeable
charging door (3), which door (3) is displaceable transverse

to the conveying means in a guiding means and sealingly
pressable at the charging opening in the conveying direction,

and at least one suction duct (10, 11, 12) connected to the
drying tunnel (4), a drying means (15) for the sucked-off air

and at least one return duct (20, 21, 22) for the dried air.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the
conveying means is comprised of a belt conveyor or a

suspension line, which is interrupted in the region of the
doors (9) displaceable transverse to the conveying means and

designed to be displaceable or pivotable in the conveying
direction.
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the drying tunnel (4) is designed as a tube.
A device according to claim 2, 3 or 4, characterized in
that the drying tunnel (4) in the conveying direction is

subdivided into a plurality of separate chambers (6, 7, 8)
which are sealingly separated from one another by partition

walls (9) or doors displaceable transverse to the conveying
means, and that separate suction ducts (10, 11, 12) and return

ducts (20, 21, 22) are connected to the chambers (6, 7, 8). 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that the drying means (15) for the

recirculated gas is designed as a cooling means for condensing
moisture and as a degerminating means, whose heat exchanger is

arranged in the return duct (18) for preheating the dried and
degerminated gas returned.
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 6,
characterized in that a suction pump (14) for cyclically

sucking off moist air is separately connected with individual
chambers (6, 7, 8) and that the suction pump (14) as well as

stop valves (13) are controlled between the connections of the
suction ducts (10, 11, 12) to the chambers (6, 7, 8) and the

suction pump (14) as a function of the moisture values
measured in the individual chambers (6, 7, 8).
