 FIBER OPTIC CONNECTORSPECIFICATION Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to connectors and more particularly to connectors for optic fibers.Background of the Invention Connectors for optic fibers have been disclosed in the following United States Letters Patent Numbers: 4,097,129 (Wellington et al) , 4,188,087 (D'Auria et al) , 4,212,514 (Prunier et al) , 4,236,787 (Iacono et al) , 4,320,938 (Gunnersen et al) , 4,325,607 (Carlsen) , 4,458,983 (Roberts), 4,767,178 (Sasaki et al) , 4,793,683 (Cannon, Jr. et al) , 4,807,957 (de Jong et al) , 4,812,003 (Dambach et al) , 4,812,006 (Osborn et al) , and 4,838,640 (Anderton) .In the aforenoted United States Patent No. 4,236,787 (Iacono et al) there is disclosed an optical fiber connector having a pair of sections, each of which is arranged to have the free end of a respective optic fiber extend therethrough. One of the sections includes an elastic compressible, cone having a bore extending therethrough and into which the bare, i.e., uncoated or unjacketed, free ends of both of the optic fibers extend to abut each other to form a light transmissive joint. The other of the sections includes an annulus which is flared outwardly in correspondence to the tapered cone. The two sections are arranged to be threadedly engaged so that cone is received in and radially compressed by the annulus to decrease the inside diameter of its optic fiber holding bore so that the fibers will be axially aligned. In one embodiment of the connector respective compressible sleeves are provided to hold or secure the jackets of the two optic fibers adjacent their bare free ends as the two sections of the connector.In the aforenoted United States Patent No. 4,097,129 (Wellington et al) there is disclosed another optic fiber connector making use of a compressible body formed of a flexible and resilient molded plastic having a mid-portion including a bore in which the free ends of the optic fibers 

 to be joined are located. A threaded member is mounted on the compressible body to compress the mid-portion so that the optic fibers are aligned in the bore. That connector also includes two additional threaded members for compressing the ends of the body to clamp the jackets of each of the optic fibers adjacent their bare free ends.While the aforementioned patents to Iacono et al and Wellington et al appear generally suitable for their intended purposes they never the less appear to leave something to be desired from the standpoint of functionality.In this regard the bore in
