<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide 
from a low molecular weight hydrocarbon by contact with a fluidized 

bed of catalyst employs particulate alumina heat transfer solids at 
high temperature in the presence of oxygen and/or steam. The 

particulate heat transfer solids are characterized by defined values 
of (i) peripheral surface layer Si and B, (ii) performance index, 

(iii) tapped bulk density and (iv) Davison Attrition Index. 
Sintering, agglomeration and attrition tendencies of the particles are 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process utilizing a heat transfer
solid in admixture with a catalyst, or catalysts to provide a fluidizable
contact mass for conducting synthesis gas generation reactions.
In particular, it relates to a process which utilizes high surface
purity aluminas, and composition, for conducting high temperature
fluidized bed synthesis gas operations.Particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids, e.g., alumina,
have been employed for many years as catalyst supports, or carriers,
in natural or synthetic form. For example, synthesis gas, or syn gas
(hydrogen and carbon monoxide), is produced from low molecular weight
hydrocarbons, primarily methane, reacted in the presence of steam
(steam reforming process) or oxygen (partial oxidation process), or
both steam and oxygen, at high temperature within a fluidized bed of
catalyst, e.g., nickel on an alpha alumina support. Suitably,
particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids, notably alpha alumina
solids, can be admixed with the catalyst, or catalysts, of the fluidized
bed as heat transfer solids to control the temperature of
reaction. Processes utilizing the admixtures of catalysts and heat
transfer solids in reacting low molecular weight hydrocarbons in the
presence of both steam and oxygen, it has been found, have provided
overall improved thermal and economic efficiencies in the production
of syn gas.Certain particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids as heat
transfer materials are more resistant than others to melting and
agglomeration at the severe high temperature oxidizing and reducing
conditions encountered in fluidized bed syn gas generation processes.
These particulate refractory inorganic oxides permit substantially
isothermal reactor conditions in conducting such reactions, at least
so long as they resist melting and agglomeration which leads to
reduced fluidization quality, gas bubbles of increased size, and
inferior mass transfer. Moreover, the mechanical strength of some 
particulate solids is greater than others, and in any process the
particles must be sufficient to withstand the stress and strain of
process operations. An important pathway to loss of material from a
fluidized bed relates to particle degradation through mechanical
attrition and break up of the particles to produce fines. The amount
of mechanical fracturing and attrition of the particles that can be
tolerated during the operation is necessarily limited, and inevitably,
in any process some of the solids particles will be swept from the bed
by the
