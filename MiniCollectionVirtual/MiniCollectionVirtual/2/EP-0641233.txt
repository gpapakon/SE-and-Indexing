Device intended to modify the pressure distribution 
of a ski such as especially an alpine ski over its gliding 

surface, comprising a stiffening blade (8) provided to extend 
above the ski, and to be connected to the ski towards each of 

the ends of the blade,
 
   characterized by the fact: 


that the stiffening blade (8) is provided to extend 
above the ski from the central zone (5) of the ski towards the 

front of the ski (6), ahead of the central zone (5), where its 
front end is provided to be fixedly assembled to the ski, 
that the device includes a sensor element (14) in 
connection with the sole of the boot, capable of capturing the 

vertical thrust biases of the boot, and 
connection means (35) between the sensor element (14) 
and the stiffening blade (8) which transmit to the 

stiffening blade, in the form of a force oriented along its 
horizontal and longitudinal direction, towards the front, at 

least a portion of the downward vertical thrust of the boot 
captured by the sensor element (14). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the sensor element (14) is mobile along a vertical 

direction, and that its vertical movement is limited at least 
upwardly by an abutment (28, 31, 32). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact 
that the connection means between the sensor element (14) and 

the stiffening blade (8) comprise a tipping element (35) 
having two arms (35a, 35b) journaled about a horizontal and 

transverse axis (38) borne by an element (23) adapted to be 
fixedly connected to the ski, having moreover a journal axis 

(40) with the stiffening blade (8) and a support zone (36) 
along  

 
which the sensor element (14) transmits the vertical thrust of 

the boot, such that a downward vertical thrust exerted by 
the sensor on the tipping element tends to make the 

tipping element pivot about the axis (38), and that such 
thrust is transmitted by the tipping element to the stiffening 

blade in the form of a force oriented towards the front 
along the longitudinal direction of the blade. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the stiffening blade (8) has a 

compression pre-stressing means (47, 49). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized by the fact 
that the stiffening blade (8) has, along a portion of its 

length, two elements (45, 46) journaled with respect to one 
another in the manner of a knuckle joint about a horizontal 

and transverse axis (47) in such a way that in the presence 
of the boot, the knuckle joint is flattened, generating an 

initial pre-stress in both portions of the stiffening 
blade, and that in the absence of the boot, the knuckle 

joint is broken, freeing the stiffening blade from its 
pre-stress. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized by the fact 
that the journal axis (47) of both the knuckle joint elements 

is slidably mounted along one of the elements, in the 
direction of a distancing from the other element against 

the elastic return force of at least one spring (49). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that it has an abutment means (53) that places both elements 

(45, 46) of the knuckle joint in support, along a 
longitudinal direction when such knuckle joint is in the 

flattened position. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 
for a ski equipped with a front binding element (3) adapted 

to retain the front of the boat, and a rear binding element  
 

(4) adapted to retain the rear of the boot, characterized 
by the fact that the sensor element is the support element 

(14) associated with the rear binding element (4), on which 
the rear end of the sole of the boot rests. 
Device according to claim 8 for a ski whose rear 
binding element comprises a body (21) slidably mounted 

along a slide (22), characterized by the fact that the support 
element (14) that constitutes the sensor is affixed to the 

slide (22), and that the slide (22) is journaled about a 
horizontal and transverse axis (24) with respect to a base 

(23) adapted to be fixedly connected to the ski. 
Device according to claim 9, characterized by the 
fact that the front binding element (3) is mounted on a front 

base (16) that can be affixed to the ski, said base having a 
longitudinal recess (19) that the stiffening blade (8) freely 

crosses along a longitudinal direction. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the connection means between the sensor element (14) 

and the stiffening blade (8) comprise a knuckle joint device 

(75), constituted by two levers journaled with respect to one 
another about a horizontal and transverse axis, the end of 

one lever being connected to an abutment (76) that can be 
affixed to the ski (1), the free end of the other lever being 

connected to the stiffening blade (8), and the sensor coming 
to rest on the central portion of the knuckle joint device. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the connection means comprise a strip (78) whose 

central portion is rounded upwardly, one end of which is 
adapted to be fixedly connected to the ski, the other end of 

which is connected to the stiffening blade (8), and whose 
central convex portion receives the downward vertical forces 

captured by the sensor element (14).  
 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the connection means between the sensor element (14) 

and the stiffening blade (8) comprise an inclined lever (79) 
that extends between a longitudinal abutment (80) vertically 

mobile with the sensor element (14) and the stiffening blade 
(8). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that it comprises, furthermore, a rear lath (58) that 

extends from the central zone (5) towards the rear portion of 
the ski where it can be affixed to the ski, that the 

stiffening blade (8) is in simple support against the rear 
lath (58) along a rearward longitudinal direction, and that 

the connection means (35) are only connected to the stiffening 
blade (8). 
Device according claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that it comprises moreover a rear lath (78) adapted to extend 

from the rear of the ski up to an abutment (69) that can be 
affixed to the ski and located in the vicinity of the rear 

binding element. 
Ski,especially adapted for alpine skiing, on which 
is assembled at least one binding element (3, 4) adapted to 

retain a boot, characterized by the fact that it is equipped 
with a device intended to modify its pressure distribution 

over its gliding surface, according to any of claims 1 through 
15.
