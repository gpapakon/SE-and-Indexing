<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compression joint for reinforcement and support over bent tubular components. According to the invention, a first sleeve (5) is applied around the bent tubular component, the inner surface (10) of the first sleeve being formed to fit closely around the tube at the point of reinforcement. This sleeve (5) is divided into at least two parts along axial sections and has an outer, substantially rotationally symmetrical surface (11). Around this sleeve (5), a second sleeve (9) with an inner rotationally symmetrical surface is arranged. The outer surface of this second sleeve (9) is adapted to receive a winding (14, 15) comprising several layers of strip or wire of memory metal. Before being wound around the second sleeve (9) at a temperature below the transition temperature of the memory metal, the strip or wire has been stretched to a suitable length to bring about a desired compressive stress in the joint after being wound on and a subsequent increase of the temperature of the winding (14, 15) above the transition temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
Compression jointTesting of welded joints in, for example, pressure vessels or tubes often leads to different types of fault indications in the weld or in material adjoining the weld. This has become accentuated by the introduction, especially in nuclear power plants, of new testing technique and new testing criteria. It is known in, for example, straight rotationally symmetrical tubes to place a compression joint over the welded joint to reinforce this and prevent crack growth in the region around the weld. For this purpose, compression joints consisting of a winding in several layers of strip or wire have been used. The strip or wire has been of memory metal. Prior to being wound on, with no signifi- cant tensile stress in the wire around the tube, at a tempe- rature below the transition temperature of the memory metal, the wire has been stretched to a suitable length to achieve the desired compressive stress in the joint after the winding around the tube and a subsequent increase of the temperature above the transition temperature.If the joint weld is arranged between a straight and a bent tube or between two bent tubes, however, difficulties arise in winding on a strip or a wire around the joint since the bent tube does not form a rotationally symmetrical base for the winding operation.The present invention relates to an invention which elimiÂ¬ nates the above-mentioned difficulties. According to the invention, the compression joint comprises a first sleeve whose inner surface is formed to fit closely around the tube over the point which is to be reinforced, for example a welded joint. The sleeve is divided into at least two parts along axial sections. The first sleeve is formed with an outer, substantially rotationally symmetrical surface. A second sleeve with a corresponding inner rotationally symmetrical surface is divided into at least two parts along axial sections and intended to be rotatably arranged around 

the first sleeve after the first sleeve has been placed around the reinforcement point. The outer surface of the second sleeve is designed to receive a winding comprising several layers of strip or wire of memory metal. Prior to being wound around the second sleeve at a temperature below the transition temperature of the memory metal, this strip or wire has been stretched to a suitable length to bring about the desired co pressive stress in the joint after the winding around the second sleeve and a subsequent increase of the temperature of the winding above the transition
