<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
paper which is based on neutralized paper and exhibits
excellent performance as toner-transfer paper for
electrophotographic printing, and also relates to a
method of image formation by electrophotographic
printing by use of this printing paper.The present invention further relates a
printing paper which is based on neutralized paper and
capable of forming sharp images in ink-jet recording,
and also relates to a method of image formation by ink-jet
printing by use of this printing paper.An electrophotographic copying machine is
exemplified by a copying machine which conducts
printing through the process of: charging a
photoconductive photosensitive member by means of a
temporary electric charger; exposing the photosensitive
member to light to form a latent image; developing the
latent image with a developing toner of one- or two-component
type, transferring the toner image from the
photosensitive member to a printing paper sheet fed 
from the outside by means of a toner-transfer electric
charger, and fixing the transferred toner on the
printing paper sheet by action of heat and/or pressure
by means of a fixing roller or the like to obtain a
final copied image.The properties required for the transfer paper
for such a copying machine are as follows:
(1) optimum surface electrical resistance and optimum
surface smoothness and good in satisfactory toner
transfer property,(2) excellent in toner-fixing properties,(3) less paper dust formation, i.e., causing no image
defect by sticking of the formed paper dust on a
photosensitive member, an electric charging roller,
etc.,(4) causing no scrape nor abrasion of the
photosensitive member, the paper-delivering roller,
fixing rolls, etc. by the formed dust (filler, etc.),(5) generating no curling by action of heat,(6) generating no variation of the paper dimension by
humidity change,(7) low stiffness, and optimum surface friction
coefficient and excellent in deliverability.In recent years, neutralized paper has come to
be used widely in place of conventional acidic paper
for storability of paper and other reasons. Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 59-191068 discloses 
toner-transfer paper suitable for electrophotographic
printing.On the other hand, the ink-jet printing system
is attracting attention because of ease of high speed
printing, color printing, and high-density printing,
and therefore the ink-jet printing apparatus has come
to be used widely. In particular, for mono-color
printing and business color
