<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manual chain block,
and more specifically to a manual chain block having a load
sheave supported rotatably between a pair of side plates so
that the load sheave can be rotated by an actuating
operation of an actuating mechanism having a hand wheel to
wind up and unwind a load chain looped around the load
sheave.In a conventional manual chain block adapted to rotate a
load sheave by operating an actuating mechanism having a
hand wheel, for example as disclosed in the Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. Sho. 40 (1965) - 8997, a wheel cover
for covering the actuating mechanism is attached to an
outside of a side plate.As shown in Fig. 15, this wheel cover has introducing
openings 103, 104 for a hand chain 102 looped around a hand
wheel 101, formed in a lower portion of a cover body 100 on
its opposite sides relative to the hand wheel 101 and a
lower cover side wall 105 so formed integrally with the
cover body 100 between those introducing openings 103, 104
as to define lower opening edges of the introducing openings
103, 104 with the cover body 100. The cover body 100 is
fixedly secured by a plurality of stay bolts 106 to an 
actuating mechanism side side plate 107 of two side plates
107, 108 for supporting a load sheave (not illustrated).Incidentally, in Fig. 15, the symbol 109 designates a
gear cover and the symbol 110 does a hand chain guide.But, the wheel cover having the above-mentioned
constitution is formed from a sheet metal, and the lower
cover side wall 105 defining the lower opening edges of the
introducing openings 103, 104 is formed integrally with the
cover body 100 by a bending process. Thereupon, since the
lower cover side wall 105 is formed of the sheet metal
similarly to the cover body 100 and pushed and secured to
the side plate 107 by tightening nuts 111 threadably engaged
with the stay bolts 106, its strength is not enough.
Therefore, the cover side wall 105 is formed comparatively
wide as shown in Fig. 15.While the opposite side edges of the cover side wall 105
define the introducing openings 103, 104, the cover side
wall 105 is formed wide for attaining its sufficient
strength. Accordingly, the opposite side edges of the cover
side wall 105 come near to the introducing passages of the
hand chain 102 passing through the introducing openings 103,
104. When the hand chain 102 is operated abruptly and
violently to jump up or when a large load is imposed to the
hand chain 102 to incline the whole of the chain block, the
hand chain 102 is brought into

openings (15b, 15c) there is provided a cover holding
member (50) having side surfaces (51, 52) which face

introducing passages (60) for said hand chain (40) and
define lower opening edges of said introducing openings

(15b, 15c) and a cover receiving portion (55) for receiving
said wheel cover (15) located between the introducing

openings (15b, 15c) and said cover holding member (50) is
tightened together with said cover (15) to said side plate

(1) by stay bolt means (12).
