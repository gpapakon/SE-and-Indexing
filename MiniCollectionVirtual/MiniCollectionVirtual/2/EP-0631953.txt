<ABSTRACT>
A retard feeder system having a noise suppression device which 
feeds sheets from a stack of sheets to a sheet transport path. The device 

includes a sheet feeding friction device (104) for engaging and moving 
sheets in a direction toward the path, a retard pad (202) positioned 

adjacent said sheet feeding device to form a retard nip to permit selective 
feeding of individual sheets through the retard nip to the path, and a 

raised portion (206) in the path for corrugating the sheet as portions of the 
sheet are engaged in the retard nip. The corrugation of the sheet helps to 

minimize the sheet flutter and vibration while it is within the retard nip by 
increasing the beam strength of the sheet and thereby decreases the 

audible noise created by the vibrating sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
sheet feeding apparatus having a noise
suppression device therein.Various apparatus and techniques have been developed and
used to transport the sheets from the sheet trays in an effective and
efficient manner. These devices include so-called retard feeders which can
include generally a transport actuator, such as a friction roller or belt for
engaging a surface of a particular sheet to move the sheet along a path and
a pad or other retard surface proximate the transport actuator for
engaging the surface of and retarding the transport of other sheets
tending to move with the particular sheet. In these devices, there is,
however, a problem associated with such transports in that often the
transport of the sheets by the sheet actuator and the retard surface is
accompanied by an audible noise. Thus, there exists a need to provide a
retard feeding apparatus, which for increased convenience, utility and
versatility of such retard feeding apparatus, exhibits both a reduced noise
volume in the transport of sheets, as well as, fewer incidents of noise
associated with the the transport of sheets thereby.U.S.-A- 4,901,117 to Derrick, incorporated by reference into this
application, discloses a sheet feeder having plural copy sheet trays for
retaining sheets to be fed therefrom to a common path for transport to a
transfer station of an electrophotographic printing machine. The sheet
trays are arranged in a substantially horizontal plane with respect to each
other.U.S.-A- 4,660,963 to Stemmle, incorporated by reference into
this application, discloses a sheet feeder having plural copy sheet trays for
retaining sheets to be fed therefrom to a common path for transport to a 
transfer station of an electrophotographic printing machine. As further disclosed within this
reference, both trays from which copy sheets are fed, disposed in a substantially horizontal co-planar
arrangement in a unitary drawer which can be slid away from the printing machine to load sheets, as
desired. The device also includes a mechanical loading apparatus for one of the trays so that sheet
previously imaged are returned for later duplex imaging.U.S.-A- 5,004,218 to Sardano discloses a retard type bottom sheet separator, in which the
bottom of a stack of original document sheets is driven downstream to a separation nip with a retard
pad by the planer upper flight of a driven frictional separator bottom feed belt. A shoe unit with a
large planar overlying the belt assists feeding by applying a normal force on the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for feeding individual sheets while reducing the noise associated
therewith, including


feeding means (104, 202) for advancing and separating individual sheets from a stack in a first direction;
the feeding means (104, 202) including a frictional retard pad (202); a raised member (206, 210) for

corrugating the individual sheets in a direction parallel to the sheet direction, located downstream of
said retard pad (202) in the first direction, said raised member being adapted to reduce sheet flutter

and the noise associated therewith, characterised in that said raised member (206, 210) is integral
to, or is secured at one end to, said retard pad (202) and extends away from said retard pad (202) in the

direction of sheet travel, said raised member further having a low coefficient of friction.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said raised member comprises a
ramped section (210) integral to said retard pad
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said raised member comprises a
flexible strip (206) secured at one end to said retard pad.
An electrophotographic printing machine of the type in which individual sheets are
fed from a stack by a feeder having a device to reduce the noise associated therewith, the device

comprising an apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3.
A method for reducing noise generated by feeding sheets by a retard pad feeding
apparatus, said method comprising the steps of:


urging at least one sheet in a sheet feeding direction to a retard nip;
transporting a sheet through the nip in the sheet feeding direction;
damping the vibrations induced in the transported sheet while in the nip so that audible
noise generated by said transporting step is inhibited, characterised in that the step of damping

includes corrugating the sheet during the transporting step by transporting the sheet over a raised
member (206, 210) integral to, or secured at one end to, the retard pad (202) and extending away

from said retard pad (202) in the direction of sheet travel, the raised member further having a low

coefficient of friction.
