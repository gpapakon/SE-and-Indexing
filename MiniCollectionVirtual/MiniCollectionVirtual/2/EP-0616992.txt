<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of
1,3-butylene glycol.In particular, the present invention relates to the improvements of a process
for the preparation of 1,3-butylene glycol, in which the generation of by-products
can be decreased, resulting in it being capable of obtaining 1,3-butylene glycol
having high quality (e.g. odorless) at a high yield.1,3-butylene glycol is an organic compound which has a boiling point of
208°C under ordinary pressure, is viscous, colorless, transparent and low odor,
exhibits an excellent solubility and a capability of producing chemically-stable
derivatives, and is a useful compound as a solvent for coatings, starting materials
for various synthetic resins and surfactants, a high-boiling-point solvent and
antifreeze, food supplements, animal food supplements, a humectant for tobacco
composition and an intermediate for preparation of various other compounds.Recently in particular, high-quality odorless 1,3-butylene glycol has been
used as a solvent for toiletry products in the field of cosmetics due to its excellent
moisture absorptive property, low volatility, low irritation and low toxicity.However, the scope for the application of 1,3-butylene glycol is limited due
to a very minor quantity of residual odor.Most recently in particular, further improvement in the quality and the yield
of an odorless, so-called "cosmetic grade" 1,3-butylene glycol has been strongly
desired.Heretofore, there have been three widely-known processes for the
preparation of 1,3-butylene glycol which are described below. 
(1) A method (British Patent N° 853266) in which acetaldol is first prepared by
aldol condensation of acetaldehyde, and then catalytically hydrogenated to
obtain 1,3-butylene glycol.(2) A method in which 1,3-butylene glycol is prepared by a hydration reaction
of 1,3-butyleneoxide.(3) A method in which 1,3-butylene glycol is prepared from propylene and
formaldehyde by the Prince Reaction.However, method (2) is not yet completed for use as an industrial
manufacturing process, and therefore is unpractical.And, method (3) is also unpractical because it gives only a low yield.Therefore, 1,3-butylene glycol has been industrially manufactured by
method (1).However, acetaldol is not stable due to its chemical structure.For example, croton aldehyde is produced by dehydration of acetaldol,
resulting in the production of various impure materials as by-products, for
example, butanol, 2-butanone, etc.It is known that the above-mentioned acetaldol

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 1,3-butylene glycol by steps (a), (b)
and (c) ;


(a) aldol condensation step of acetaldehyde in the presence of an alkali catalyst
to obtain a crude reaction solution primarily containing aldoxane,

acetaldehyde, water and small amounts of crotonaldehyde ;
(b) thermal decomposition step of aldoxane to obtain paraldol while distilling
off a distillate containing acetaldehyde, water and small amounts of crotonaldehyde

from the crude reaction solution ;
(c) hydrogenation step of paraldol to obtain 1,3-butylene glycol in the presence
of a catalyst ;

characterised in that a refined acetaldehyde not containing a substantial amount of
crotonaldehyde is recirculated to step (a) after removal of crotonaldehyde from the

distillate in step (b).
A process as set forth in claim 1, wherein said removal of crotonaldehyde
is carried out in an acetaldehyde distillation column having a side-stream

recirculating line equipped with a decanter.
