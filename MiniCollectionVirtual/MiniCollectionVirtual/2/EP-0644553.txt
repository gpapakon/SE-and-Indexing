<ABSTRACT>
A data compressor (14) generates codewords representative 
of the location and length of a string match between an input data 

stream and a CAM array vocabulary table (22). A data 
decompressor (16) looks up the codewords for a string match in 

its vocabulary table. The CAM array (50,52,54,56) is arranged in 
a serpentine configuration to reduce track layout. A column 

priority encoder (74) reverses the priority of alternate rows to 
maintain the logical flow through the CAM array. The CAM array 

uses a flipflop (122) with a common control circuit to transfer 
and refresh data through the flipflop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data
compression schemes and, more particularly, to the
interconnection of content addressable memory in a data
compressor.Data compression schemes are well known in the art for
encoding a stream of digital data signals into compressed digital
data. Data compression generally refers to a process of inputting
the data stream in a standard format, say 8-bit ASCII characters,
and outputting the same information in a compressed format with
fewer bits than the original format.The compressing process is advantageous when considering
data storage and data transmission. If the data is compressed
into fewer total bits that represent the same information, then
less space is required in the mass storage device. Likewise, data
transmission occurs more rapidly when fewer bits are
transmitted. In general by reducing the total number of ones and
zeroes, data becomes more efficient to handle. When the time
comes to use the data, it must be decompressed back into its
original format for use by the end device.One common compression technique is described in U.S.
patent 5,003,307. The compression system includes a data
compressor, a data decompressor and an interconnecting medium
such as a transmission link or a mass storage device.
Uncompressed data words are serially processed through the data
compressor which builds a compressor vocabulary table
comprising a history of incoming data and which sends a sequence
of codewords across the transmission link, or to the mass
storage device, to the data decompressor. The codewords are
serially processed through the data decompressor to build a
corresponding decompressor vocabulary table and provide
uncompressed data words to the end device. In the data compressor, each incoming data word is
compared to the existing vocabulary table. If no match is found,
the data compressor sends the data word as part of a codeword
across the transmission link, or to the mass storage device, and
further places the data word at the end of the vocabulary table.
No actual data compression occurs if no match is found. The
transmission capacity needed to send an uncompressed data word
may be ten bits: eight bits for the uncompressed data word and
two bits, say "00", to represent the "length" of the matched string
of data words--in this case zero.If on the other hand one or more matches are found in the
vocabulary table, the data compressor notes the locations of the
matches in the vocabulary table. No data is sent initially but the
incoming data is still
