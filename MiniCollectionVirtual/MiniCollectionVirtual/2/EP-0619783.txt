A system for feeding a printing substrate in the 
form of a continuous coiled web (5) to a laser type 

printer (10) not designed for this purpose and 
delivering the said web (5) in a given format, 

comprising an inlet means (12) and an outlet means (14) 
respectively disposed at the inlet (22) and at the 

outlet (24) of the said printer (10), characterised in 
that they both comprise guillotining means (32, 34) for 

cutting the said web (5) and a means for measuring the 
length of the said web (5) between two successive cuts. 
A feed and delivery system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the said length of the web (5) 

between two successive cuts for the said inlet means 
(12) corresponds to the maximum length of the substrate 

accepted by the said printer (10). 
A feed and delivery system according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the said inlet means (12) and 

outlet means (14) also comprise upstream of the 
guillotining means (32, 34) a means (36, 37) for 

stretching the said web. 
A feed and delivery system according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the said stretching means (36, 

37) comprises at least two drive rollers (38, 40; 39, 
41) rotating at different speeds.  

 
A feed and delivery system according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the said measuring 

means comprises at least one means (46, 50, 51, 52) for 
detecting the said web. 
A feed and delivery system according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the said detection means (46, 50, 

51, 52 is a photoelectric cell. 
A feed and delivery system according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the said detection means (46) is 

a microswitch. 
A feed and delivery system according to any one of 
claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the said measuring 

means also comprises a guide (42) on to one surface 
(44) of which the web (5) is applied naturally, the 

said surface (44) having a given length. 
A feed and delivery system according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the said measuring 

means comprises a phonic wheel (60) rotated by the said 
web (5). 
A feed and delivery system according to any one of 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the said inlet 

means (12) is disposed beneath the said printer (10), a 
guide (42) being provided to guide the paper to the 

inlet (22) of the printer (10), while the outlet means 
(14) is disposed above the printer (10), a tray (48) 

for receiving the cut substrate being provided 
downstream of the said outlet means (14).
