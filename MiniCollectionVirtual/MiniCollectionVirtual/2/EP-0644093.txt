<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling brake pressures is
disclosed which is capable of controlling a distribution

of braking efforts in the absence of a brake pedal
operation by a driver. The apparatus comprises a master

cylinder (2) for generating a primary pressure and a
booster (5) for generating a secondary pressure; a source

of constant pressure (21, 22) for producing a tertiary
pressure which is a substantially constant high pressure;

first selection means (64, 65) for selecting one of the
secondary and the tertiary pressure; second selection

means (61 - 63) for selecting one of the pressure selected
by the first selection means and the primary pressure;

and first to fourth intensifying/reducing means (312, 334,
356, 378) for selectively supplying the pressure selected

by the second selection means or a low pressure to individual
wheel brakes (51 - 54). To provide a reasonable

harmony between the antiskid control and the braking
effort distribution control, a controller for the apparatus

comprises reference value means (10) for providing
a restricted condition for the initiation of a pressure

regulation by the antiskid control whenever the braking
effort distribution control is regulating the wheel

brake pressures, means (10) for forcibly interrupting the
antiskid control whenever the braking effort distribution

control is terminated, and liquid pressure compensation
means (10) for temporarily intensifying the pressures when

the antiskid control is terminated during the execution
of the braking effort distribution control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for controlling
a liquid brake pressure applied to a wheel brake, and while
not intended to be limited thereto, in particular, to an
apparatus which is preferred for use in an antiskid control
or traction control in which a compression or decompression
of a wheel brake pressure is repeated as desired on the
basis of signals representing a wheel speed and a wheel
slip rate in order to avoid wheel lock as the wheel is
braked or an acceleration wheel idling as a driver intends
to apply a brake to or to accelerate a vehicle, and which
is also preferred for use in a control of braking efforts
to be distributed among front and rear, and left and right
wheel brakes in order to secure a running stability and a
steerability in the event a change occurs in the steering,
acceleration/deceleration, up/down grade of road surface
or unevenness, all of which influence upon the driving or
running condition of the vehicle, and in which the wheel
brake pressures are individually increased or decreased
in accordance with the calculated distribution.Normally, a brake pressure (primary pressure)
corresponding to the degree of depression of a brake pedal
being operated by a driver is applied to a wheel brake 
from a brake master cylinder. A moving speed (reference
speed) of a vehicle is estimated from the rotational
speed of a plurality of wheels. The slip rate of wheels
or the coefficient of friction, µ, of a road surface is
calculated or estimated from the reference speed and the
rotational speed of wheels, and the wheel brake pressure
is decompressed so as to avoid a complete interruption
of rotation of the wheels (a wheel lock) even through
the vehicle continues its movement. Subsequently the
brake pressure is compressed or intensified so that the
stroke through which the braking is applied be minimized,
and such decompression and compression are repeated as
required. Such operation is commonly referred to as an
antiskid control. Such an antiskid control is enabled
by the provision of a source of pressure comprising
an intensifying/reducing valve which decompresses or
compresses a wheel brake pressure, a fluid pump for
supplying a pressure (secondary pressure) higher than
the primary pressure, and an electric motor which drives
the pump. The antiskid control is executed by an electronic
controller, and when it determines that there is a need
to change a wheel brake pressure (automatic intervention),
it causes the pressure source to supply the secondary
pressure to the valve, which
