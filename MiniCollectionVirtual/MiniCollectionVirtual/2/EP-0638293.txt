<CLAIMS>
Device for positioning a magnet to be placed in a prosthesis,
especially a tooth prosthesis, relative to an implanted

magnet,
characterized by
 a sleeve-shaped element (4) which can be
attached to the implanted magnet (2) or to a magnet (2)

fixed on an implant, into which element (4) the magnet (3)
to be positioned in the prosthesis can be inserted.
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that

on the inner circumference of the sleeve-shaped element (4)
a partition wall (5) is formed, which maintains the two

magnets (2,3) at a predetermined distance from one another.
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the element (4) is provided with a cone-frustrum shaped
sleeve body (8).
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that

a covering flange (6) extends radially outwards from the
lower edge of the element (4).
Device according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the element (4) consists of a soft silicon which is suitable

for the human body.
