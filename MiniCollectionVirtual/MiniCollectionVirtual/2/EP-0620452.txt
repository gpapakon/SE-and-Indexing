<ABSTRACT>
Method of energy calibration of an electronic assembly for detecting beta radiation and/or X-ray and gamma photons having Compton distribution, which are emitted by a radioactive aerosol, including two identical systems (chains), one of which records the (beta+photon) spectrum and the other of which records the photon spectrum, the indications of which being subtracted, characterised in that this calibration is carried out with the aid of alpha sources in the following manner:   - the two systems are equipped with identical alpha, beta and photon detectors which are in the form of semiconductor particle detectors which are small enough to be sensitive only to the "Compton distribution" of the photon spectrum; - each of the semiconductor particle detectors is subjected to a standard alpha source of known energy which is identical for each source, and the spectrum of the alpha particles from the corresponding source is recorded on each system; - the energy calibration threshold of each of the systems is made to correspond with the almost vertical falling front of the alpha spectrum of the standard sources in order to adjust the two systems identically with respect to energy.

Method for the energy calibration of an electronic detection unit for
the detection of Compton distribution gamma, X photon and beta rays emitted

by a radioactive aerosol, having two identical chains, whereof one records
the beta+photon spectrum and the other the photon spectrum and the difference

of the indications is formed, characterized in that said calibration
takes place with the aid of alpha sources in the following way:


the two chains are provided with identical photon, beta and alpha detectors
in the form of semiconductor detectors (4, 6), which are sufficiently

thin to only be sensitive to the Compton distribution part of the photonic
spectrum,
each of the semiconductor detectors (4, 6) is subject to the action of a
standard alpha source (26) of known energy and which is identical for each

source and on each chain is recorded the spectrum of the alpha particles of
the corresponding source,
correspondence is brought about between the energy calibration threshold
of each of the chains and the quasi-vertical falling front (24) of the alpha

spectrum of the standard sources in order to bring about an identical
energy regulation of the two chains.
Device for implementing the calibration method according to claim 1,
wherein the detectors (4, 6) of the two chains are constituted by two

adjacent, thin semiconductor detectors separated by a shield (22) absorbing
the alpha and beta particles and placed in the vicinity of a deposit of

aerosols fixed by suction to a filter (18), the device having at least one
alpha source (26) located in the vicinity of the semiconductor detctors

(4, 6) and retractable into a tight sheath (28) masking the alpha radiation
for the two semiconductor detectors.
