Process for build-up granulation of a powdered
material and coating the granules in a fluidised bed

with a binder contained in a granulating liquid, wherein
the powdered material is fluidised, at least in parts of

its bulk, in a fluidised bed apparatus by means of a gas
current introduced from below through a perforated base

and the granulating liquid is sprayed from above the
fluidised bed into fluidised zones of the material,

characterised in that the granulating liquid is sprayed
by means of at least one flat jet nozzle substantially

in counter-current to the gas current which forms the
fluidised bed, said flat jet nozzle migrating over the

fluidised bed.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
at least one two-component overpressure flat jet nozzle

is used for external mixing, which is operated at a
pressure of atomising gas of 2 to 6 bar.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that a plurality of flat jet nozzles are used which are

distributed as evenly as possible over the surface of
the fluidised bed.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that only parts of the bulk of the

material are fluidised and that these parts and,
together with them, the flat jet nozzles are allowed to

migrate through or over the bulk material.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that substantially all the bulk

material is fluidised in the fluidised bed and the flat 
jet nozzles are allowed to migrate over the fluidised

bed.
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5
for processing a feed additive containing zinc

bacitracin, characterised in that, in the fluidised bed
apparatus, a specific bulk of 200-300 kg of starting

material is processed per m
2
 of perforated base, and the
granulating liquid used is a 4 to 6% by weight aqueous

solution of methyl cellulose.
Fluidised bed apparatus having a container (2, 6),
a perforated base (4) arranged in the container (2) for

carrying powdered material, a device (12, 14) arranged
underneath the perforated base (4) for introducing

fluidising gas through the perforated base into the
material and at least one spray nozzle (26) arranged

above the fluidised bed formed, for spraying granulating
liquid, as well as means for conveying the granulating

liquid to the or each spray nozzle (26), characterised
in that the or each spray nozzle (26) is a flat jet

nozzle which is rotatable about the central axis of the
container and which is arranged so that its direction of

spraying is substantially downwards in countercurrent to
the gas current which forms the fluidised bed.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 7,
characterised in that the or each spray nozzle (26) is a

two-component overpressure flat jet nozzle with external
mixing.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 8,
characterised in that the or each flat jet nozzle (26)

is designed for a pressure of atomising gas of 2 to
7 bar and for a pressure of 0.2 to 3.0 bar in the

granulating liquid which is to be atomised. 
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 8 or 9,
characterised in that the or each flat jet nozzle (26)

is designed for a liquid throughput, based on water, of
1.5 to 5.0 l/min.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to at least one
of claims 7 to 10, with a container (2, 6) of

substantially circular cross-section, characterised in
that the or each flat jet nozzle (26) is arranged with

its spraying area directed substantially radially, the
spraying area, based on the vertical central axis (22)

of the container extending only on one side of said axis
substantially along a radius, and the spray nozzle (26)

being rotatable about the central axis of the container.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 11,
characterised in that a plurality of flat jet nozzles

(26), preferably 6-12 flat jet nozzles, are uniformly
distributed over the circumference of the container

(2, 6).
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 11 or
12, characterised in that the flat jet nozzles (26) are

mounted by means of arms (24) on a central rotation
shaft (22) and optionally the supply of granulating

liquid to the flat jet nozzles (26) is provided through
the hollow rotation shaft (22) and the arms (24).
Fluidised bed apparatus according to at least one

of claims 11 to 13, characterised in that, under the
perforated base, there is a rotatable plate having

substantially radial air passage slots which are
rotatable in registry with the flat jet nozzles.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to one of claims
7 to 10 with a container of substantially circular

cross-section, characterised in that a plurality of flat 
jet nozzles are arranged with their spray areas

substantially radially aligned at substantially equal
spacings over the circumference of the container.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to claim 15,
characterised in that 6 to 12 flat jet nozzles are

provided.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to one of claims
12 to 16, characterised in that the area of the

fluidised bed covered by the flat jet nozzles at any
time is about 10 to 25% of the total area of the

fluidised bed.
Fluidised bed apparatus according to one of claims
12 to 17, characterised in that the surface of the

fluidised bed covered by a flat jet nozzle is 150 to
750 cm
2
