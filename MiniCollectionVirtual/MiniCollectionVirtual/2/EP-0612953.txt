<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a pipe connection according to the invention, the outer sleeve is optimised, by the selection of materials, in terms of linear and radial strength and frictionally locking connection and the inner part of the pipe is optimised, by the selection of materials, in terms of chemical inertness and leak-tightness of the connection. The design of pipe and connecting part is optimised in terms of connection method appropriate for the material concerned. The composite pipes 1 are composed of a rigid, comparatively thin-walled pipe outer sleeve 3 for absorbing and transmitting forces, and of a softer, likewise comparatively thin inner pipe 4 for the sealed connection and inert healing with respect to the rigid outer wall. The connecting part 2 is composed, like the pipe, of a rigid connecting outer sleeve 5 and of a weldable socket insert 10, preferably consisting of the same material as the inner pipe 1. The welding energy is introduced preferably by electric means. The feature of the design, in order to produce a frictionally locking connection, on the one hand, and a sealed connection, on the other hand, between two pipes, is that on the pipes, at the connecting point, the inner pipe is allowed to jut out, by approximately half the length of the weld sleeve 10, in the form of a free pipe stump 9 which, in the assembled state, comes to be located in the electrically weldable socket body 10, and that thus on the outer sleeve of the connecting part 2, on both sides, a socket-like portion 6 is integrally formed which, once the pipes have been inserted into the connecting part 2, encloses the corresponding regions of the pipe outer sleeve. The free inner pipe stumps 9 are welded over the entire circumference of the heating coil 12, and the connecting outer sleeve 5 is adhesively bonded in a frictionally locking manner, in the region of the socket-like portions 6, to the pipe outer sleeve 3. The consistent separation of frictionally locking and sealing connection in simultaneously but independently optimisable operations without one being able to influence the other negatively, but maintaining the advantages of both, leads to a hitherto unobtained result.
