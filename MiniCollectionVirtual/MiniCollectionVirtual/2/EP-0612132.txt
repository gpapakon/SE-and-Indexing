<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for passing a bundle of electrical wires through a wall, especially in a motor vehicle. This device, in which a length of an electrical bundle, consisting of juxtaposed wires (2) each jacketed with an insulating sheath (3), passes through a wall (5) via an opening (5a) with interpostion of a sealing sleeve (4) overmoulded onto the bundle length, is characterised in that the sheaths (3) respectively jacketing the wires (2) of the bundle length have identical cross-sections in the form of a regular polygon and are contiguous on their faces (a, b) formed by the sides of this polygon, so as to achieve acoustic sealing on either side of the aforementioned wall (5). This invention applies especially to passing a bundle of electrical wires through a wall belonging to a motor vehicle especially.

<CLAIMS>
Device for providing the passage of a bundle (1) of 
electric wires (2, 2a) through a wall (5) in particular 

of an automotive vehicle, of the kind in which one 
segment (T) of the bundle (1) consisting of juxtaposed 

wires (2, 2a) wrapped each one into an insulating sheath 
(3, 3a) extends through the wall (5) through an opening 

(5a) with the interposition of a sealing bush (4) molded 
integral with and over the segment (T), characterized in 

that the sheaths (3, 3a) wrapping the wires (2, 2a), 
respectively, of the segment (T) exhibit identical 

sections in the shape of a regular polygon and are 
joining along their faces (a, b) formed of the sides of 

this polygon so as to provide an acoustical tightness on 
either side of the aforesaid wall (5). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
polygone is a square. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
polygon is a triangle. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the segment (T) is made in a mold 

(6) comprising a support (7) comprising guide ducts (7a) 
for each sheathed wire (2) and several sliding portions 

(6a, 6b) adapted to enclose the wires of the segment (T) 

and to mold the latter integrally with and over the 
aforesaid bush (4).
