<ABSTRACT>
Pressure-operated diaphragm valve, the diaphragm (5) of which, which is clamped in a housing (1), rests on a supporting body (1a) which is arranged at the end of the inlet passage (2) and has openings (11) concentrically to the inlet passage (2) and which has a sealing edge (12) which is arranged concentrically with respect to the inlet passage but upstream of the openings, the sealing edge (12) being designed to fall stepwise in the direction of the inlet passage (2).

<CLAIMS>
Diaphragm valve which is actuable by pressure means and the diaphragm 
(5) of which, which is clamped in a housing (1), rests on a support body 

(1a), which is arranged at the end of an outlet channel (2) and has 
openings (11) concentric to the inlet channel (2) and which possesses a 

sealing edge (12) arranged concentrically to the inlet channel but in 
front of the openings with respect to flow direction, characterised 

thereby that the sealing edge (12) is formed to fall away in step shape 
in direction towards the inlet channel (2). 
Diaphragm valve, which is actuable by pressure means, according to 
claim 1, characterised thereby that the outer clamping-in surface for the 

diaphragm (5) is recessed relative to the inner edge of the openings (11) 
at the outlet side. 
Diaphragm valve, which is actuable by pressure means, according to 
claim 1, characterised thereby that the height (h) of the step (12a) of 

the sealing edge (12) is greater than 0.1 times the thickness (s) of the 
diaphragm (5), but smaller than 0.5 times the thickness (s) of the 

diaphragm (5).
