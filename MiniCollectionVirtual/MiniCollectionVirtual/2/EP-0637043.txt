<ABSTRACT>
A solid electrolytic capacitor using a conductive 
polymeric compound as a solid electrolyte is disclosed, 

wherein a powder (5) is dispersed in the conductive polymer (4) to 
provide unevenness on the surface of the solid electrolyte, 

thereby increasing the surface area, whereby a mechanical 
adhesion between the solid electrolyte and a cathode conductor 

layer is increased. The conductive polymer comprises a first 
conductive polymer layer (3) which contacts a dielectric layer (2) at 

an anode body (1) side, and a second conductive polymer layer (4) 
which contacts the cathode conductor layer (6) side, and the 

powder (5) is dispersed in the second conductive polymer layer (4). 
By this constitution, tanδ and an equivalent series 

resistance (ESR) of the solid electrolytic capacitor are 
decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid electrolytic
capacitor and a method for manufacturing the same, and more
particularly to a solid electrolytic capacitor using a
conductive polymer as a solid electrolyte and a method for
manufacturing the same.In general, the conventional solid electrolytic capacitor
is that a molding obtained by increasing a surface area of a
film-forming valve metal such as tantalum or aluminum by, for
example, sintering a fine powder thereof or etching a rolled
foil thereof is used as one electrode (anode) in counter
electrodes, and a valve metal oxide layer (Ta2O5 or Al2O3)
formed on the anode by an electrochemical anodization or the
like is used as a dielectric layer. A conductive layer is
formed on the oxidized dielectric layer, and this is used as
another electrode (cathode) in the counter electrodes. In
this case, a solid electrolyte is interposed between the
cathode conductor layer and the oxidized dielectric layer to
form part of the cathode.A metal oxide layer such as manganese dioxide or lead
dioxide (PbO2) as disclosed in, for example, JP-A-3-163814
(the term "JP-A" as use herein means a Japanese Patent
unexamined published application), or 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane
complex salt (TCNQ complex salt) as 
disclosed in, for example, JP-A-58-79255 has conventionally
been used as the solid electrolyte.It is preferred for the solid electrolyte to have a
function which electrically connects between the entire
surface of the dielectric layer on the molding surface and the
cathode conductor layer, and also a function which restores
an electrical short circuit due to inner defect of the
oxidized dielectric layer. For this reason, a metal which has
a high conductivity but does not have a dielectric material
repairing function cannot be used as the solid electrolyte,
and manganese dioxide which transfers into an insulator by,
for example, heat generated by short circuit electric current
has been used. However, in the capacitor using a metal oxide
such as manganese dioxide as a solid electrolyte, since the
conductivity of the metal oxide is not sufficiently low,
impedance at a high frequency region is large. Further, the
capacitor using the TCNQ complex salt is poor in heat
resistance due to that the TCNQ complex salt is liable to be
thermally decomposed.Recently, development on novel materials has been
progressing in a field of polymer, and as a result, a
conductive polymer exhibiting a conductivity is developed by
doping a conjugated polymer such as a polypyrrole, a
polyth
