<ABSTRACT>
A toy building set comprises primary, box-shaped building elements with a first type of coupling means which consist of coupling studs and complementary coupling means. On one side the elements are provided with coupling studs which may serve to couple an element with other corresponding elements by frictional coupling with complementary coupling means on another side. The toy building set also comprises secondary elements with an oblong body with coupling means of a second type. This set of coupling means consist of a first coupling part with coupling faces which are at least partly rotational-symmetric about an axis transversely to the longitudinal direction of the body, and a second coupling part with coupling faces adapted to grip and receive the coupling faces of the first coupling part. Two elements coupled with the second type of coupling means can assume various positions about an axis transversely to the longitudinal direction of the element. In addition, the toy building set comprises tertiary building elements which include at least one coupling means corresponding to one of the coupling means incorporated in the first set, and at least one coupling part from the second set of coupling means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a toy building set comprising a
plurality of interconnectible building elements of the
type defined in the introductory portion of claim 1.A plurality of toy building sets are known, consisting of
box-shaped building elements with coupling studs on the
upper side and complementary coupling means on the underside.
Toy building sets of this type have been marketed
for a number of years under the trademark DUPLO and are described
in US-A-3 597 875. With
building elements of this type it is possible to build
compact and relatively simple structures, and these building
elements therefore appeal to small children in particular.As the children develop, they try to meet their needs with
toy building sets making it possible to build more complex
structures. A plurality of examples of toy building sets
of this type are known, an example being the toy building
set described in the European Patent Application EP-A-460 081
This toy building set consists of a plurality of elements
which can be fixed mutually in a variable angle. A toy
building set of this type will be suitable for building
large and flexible structures which contain moving parts.The object of the invention is to provide a toy building
set which consists of a plurality of interconnectible
building elements, making it possible to combine the advantages
possessed by the box-shaped building elements
having coupling studs with the flexibility possessed by
the toy building set with rotatably interconnectible
building elements. This object is achieved in that the toy building set additionally
comprises a third type of building element
and a fourth type of building element as
stated in the characterizing portion of claim 1.The invention provides various embodiments of the third and fourth
types of building element, and these are described in the
subclaims. The invention is unique in the shown embodiments in that
the modular measures known from the first type of building
elements are maintained in the interconnection in certain
positions with the elements of the second and the third
types. This applies both to the interconnection of the
elements in elongation of each other and to the building
of structures in the stacking direction.The invention provides a toy building set by means of
which it is possible to construct both small, compact and
large, flexible structures.A building element of the third type
is unique in that the coupling parts of
the second set of coupling means are adapted for mutual
interconnection by elastic movement of
