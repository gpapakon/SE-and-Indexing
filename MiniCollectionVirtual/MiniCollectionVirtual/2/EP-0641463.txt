Process for mapping an area, 

a) in which, in a first step, a boundary (B) of the area 
is established by means of a sensor, 
b) in which, in a further step, a self-propelled device 
(AE) moves up to the boundary (B) of the area, 
c) in which, in a further step, the device (AE) moves 
along the boundary (B) and when doing so applies along 

its path markings (M1) at a distance from the boundary 
(B), 
d) in which, in a further step, the device (AE) turns 
around when it encounters a further boundary of the area 

and moves, taking its bearings from the previously 
applied markings (M1), and applies further markings (M2) 

at a distance from the previously applied markings (M1), 
e) in which the steps c) and d) are carried out until the 
entire area has been explored, 
f) and in which the geometry of the area is recorded for 
further evaluation. 
Autonomous self-propelled device for carrying out 
the process according to Claim 1, 


a) in which at least one sensor (S) is provided, which 
detects obstacles and marking means (M1, M2), 
b) in which means for marking (M1, M2) the area are 
provided, 
c) and in which means for recording the geometry of the 
area are provided in order to map the latter. 
Device according to Claim 2, in which the sensor 
(S) detects the area boundary (B). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 or 3, in  
 

which the means for marking (M1, M2) are small metal 
plates or the power cable of the device (AE). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, in 
which the device (AE) has a further means which removes 

the marking (Ml,M2) again after use. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, in 
which the sensor (S) is an ultrasonic sensor. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, in 
which the sensor (S) is a camera.
