<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a self-supporting frame for 
vehicles, which frame is partially made of a hardened cast 
material on the basis of at least one mineral hardening 
binding agent and at least one filling material and 
partially of metal parts. The term vehicle should be understood in the broad sense 
here, as any frame resting on wheels, caterpillars or 
sliding surfaces that can be pulled or pushed, whether or 
not by its own engine mounted upon it. The invention concerns in particular, but not exclusively, 
a frame for an industrial vehicle such as a lorry, and even 
more in particular a frame for a wheeled hoist. A self-supporting frame of this kind is known from 
US-A-1.574.180. The metal parts are frames, provided with 
wire nettings which are embedded in concrete, said frames 
forming the outer boundaries of the concrete sections and 
wire netting sections. Construction of the self-supporting 
frame is rather complicated. The invention aims to remedy these disadvantages and to 
provide a self-supporting frame for vehicles which is cheap 
and can be made very solid. To this aim the metal parts of he frame comprise metal 
pipes filled with the hardened cast material. In this case, the pipes are used as a mould or form. The 
pipes also serve as a reinforcement and a smaller volume of  
 
cast material is required for the same strength, than with 
exclusively cast material. Especially, but not exclusively, the frame can also replace 
the functional supporting structure and thus also the 
conventional superstructure in hoists and such like. US-A-3 944 242 discloses a supporting structure for a 
mobile home, said structure being made exclusively of 
pre-stressed concrete beams. Also US-A-3 811 722 discloses a frame structure comprised 
of stressed concrete, without other metal parts than 
reinforcement cables or rods cast into the concrete. SU-A-420 552 concerns a loader frame integrally made of 
reinforced concrete, while US-A-4 573 707 discloses a rigid 
chassis structure made from beams of composite plastic 
material. Other details and advantages of the invention will become 
clear from the following description of a self-supporting 
frame for vehicles according to the invention. This 
description is given by way of example only without 
limiting the invention in any way, with reference to the 
according drawings, where : 
figure 1 shows a side view of a self-supporting frame 
for vehicles according to the invention; figure 2 shows a section according to line II-II in
