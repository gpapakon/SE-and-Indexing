<CLAIMS>
A method of holding a motor vehicle wheel (2) which is clamped on
a measuring spindle (1) of a balancing machine in its balancing

position after the unbalance measuring operation for fixing a balancing
weight at the respective balancing position, wherein the balancing

weight is fixed to the vehicle wheel by means of a sensing device (6),
characterised in that after the motor vehicle wheel has been turned

into the balancing position when the sensing device is moved out of its
rest position a holding brake (3) is activated to stop the measuring

spindle.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that two
associated sensing devices are used for fitting balancing weights in

two balancing planes and that the holding brake is activated separately
upon actuation of each of the two sensing devices.
Apparatus for holding a motor vehicle wheel (2) which is clamped
on a measuring spindle of a balancing wheel in position, comprising a

holding brake (3) for the measuring spindle (1) and a sensing device
(6) for moving a balancing weight to the balancing position,

characterised in that there is provided a position monitoring device
(4) which provides an electrical signal when the motor vehicle wheel

(2) is turned into the balancing position after the unbalance measuring
operation, that there is provided a condition monitoring device (5)

which supplies an electrical signal when the sensing device (6) is
moved out of its rest position, that an activating device (7) is

connected to the position monitoring device (4) and the condition
monitoring device (5), and that the holding brake (3) is activated by

the activating device (7) when the two electrical signals of the
position monitoring device (4) and the condition monitoring device (5)

are supplied to the activating device (7).
