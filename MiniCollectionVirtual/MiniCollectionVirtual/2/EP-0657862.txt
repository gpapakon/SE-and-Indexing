<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of a driver
of a flat panel display and its driving method, more
particularly, to the driver of the flat panel display by
which high line sequential scanning high speed method of
a can be realized with a low power dissipation and a low
cost.In recent years, there has been a greater
demand for a flat matrix display such as a plasma display
(PDP), a liquid crystal display (LCD), or an
elecroluminescent (EL) display because of its thin
appearance rather than a CRT. Requests for, especially,
a color display are frequent these days.Flat displays including a plasma display and an
electroluminescent (EL) display are thin. Moreover, the
flat displays also permit large display screens. The
application range and production scale of the flat
displays are therefore rapidly expanding.In general, a flat display utilizes charges
accumulated between electrodes and causes a discharge to
emit light for display. For better understanding of the
general principle of display, the structure and operation
of, for example, a plasma display will be briefly
described.Well-known conventional plasma displays (AC
type PDP) are a dual-electrode type that uses two
electrodes for selective discharge (addressing discharge)
and sustaining discharge and a triple-electrode type that
uses three electrodes for addressing discharge. (EP-A-0 549 275).In a plasma display (PDP) for a color display,
ultraviolet rays resulting from discharges are used to
excite phosphors formed in discharge cells. The 
phosphors are susceptible to the impact of ions or
positive charges induced synchronously with discharge.
The above dual-electrode type has a structure that the
phosphors directly hit ions. This structure may reduce
the service lives of phosphors.To avoid the deterioration, the color plasma
display usually employs the triple-electrode structure
based on surface discharge.The triple-electrode type uses an arrangement
in which a third electrode is formed on the substrate on
which first and second electrodes for sustaining
discharge are arranged or an arrangement in which a third
electrode is formed on another substrate opposed to the
one on which first and second electrodes are arranged.In the arrangement in which three electrodes
are formed on the same substrate, the third electrode may
be placed on or under the two electrodes for sustaining
discharge.Furthermore, visible light emitted from
phosphors may be transmitted or reflected by the
phosphors for observation.The foregoing plasma displays of different
types
