<ABSTRACT>
A high-precision coordinate input apparatus having 
a small circuit construction. A vibrating pen transmits 

vibration onto a vibration transmitting tablet, then 
vibration sensors provided at corners of the vibration 

transmitting tablet detect the vibration. One of the 
vibration sensor is used as a reference sensor. Time 

difference between vibration detecting timing by this 

reference sensor and detecting timing by one of the 
other sensors is measured. This measurement is 

performed on all the vibration sensors with respect to 
the reference sensor. The obtained time differences are 

converted into distance differences for calculation of 
the coordinates of the position in which the vibration 

has been generated. The vibrating pen has a power 
source and it operates independent of the apparatus main 

body. The vibrating pen changes its frequency of 
vibration in accordance with the voltage of the power 

source. The apparatus main body captures this change in 
the vibration frequency and obtain the state of the 

vibration pen power source.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a coordinate input
apparatus which detects input vibration and specifies
the position of the vibration source so as to determine
the coordinates of the vibration input position.Conventional coordinate input apparatuses utilizing
ultrasonic vibration detect vibration inputted from a
vibrating pen by a plurality of sensors on a vibration
transmitting panel. The coordinates at the vibrating
pen input position on the vibration transmitting panel
determination is determined based on difference data,
obtained from delay times at the respective sensors,
calculated using a reference delay time from a point
where the vibration is inputted to a point where one of
the sensors (e.g., the sensor that first receives the
vibration), as a reference sensor, detects the
vibration.As shown in Fig. 11, the above coordinate input
apparatus calculates coordinates using the following
equations in accordance with the positional relation 
between vibration sensors S1 to S4 on the vibration
transmitting panel and a vibration input point P(x, y):
Δdb-Δdd calculated from the difference data among the
delay times are:
Δdb = db - daΔdc = dc - daΔdd = dd - da 
Point P(x, y) is obtained from:
x = x2 - Δdd22x + Δdd(Δdb2+Δdd2-Δdc2)2X(Δdb+Δdd-Δdc)y = y2 - Δdd22x + Δdb(Δdb2+Δdd2-Δdc2)2Y(Δdb+Δdd-Δdc)Note that the equations (104) and (105) hold if:
Δdb + Δdd - Δdc ≠ 0
If
Δdb + Δdd - Δdc = 0
the point P(x, y) is:
x = X2y = Y ± √A2A = Δdb21+X2Y2-Δdb2
Otherwise, the point P(x, y) is: 
y = Y2x = X ± √B2B = Δdd21+Y2X2-Δdd2However, the above conventional coordinate
determination method is implemented by simply assigning
a start and stop signals of a counter to the respective
signals, and measuring the time difference. When a
plurality of signals are detected upon obtaining the
difference data, the relation between group delay time
and phase delay time at each sensor is reversed, causing
erroneous judgment of the reference delay time.If two counters are used, the size of the counters
must be greater than the repetition period of a signal
source. This increases the apparatus construction cost.Further, the above coordinate calculation method
has a drawback in that if the equation (106) holds, the
results from the equations (104) and (105) tend to cause
errors in the equations (108) and (111).Generally, the conventional apparatus of this type
measures time from a point where vibration generated by
the vibrating pen is inputted to a point where the
vibration reaches one of the vibration sensors provided
at predetermined
