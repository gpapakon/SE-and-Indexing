<DESCRIPTION>
 VISCOSITY-ADJUSTED SURFACTANT CONCENTRATE COMPOSITIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Serial No. 07/644,470 filed January 18, 1991 (Attorney Docket M 4794A) which is in turn a continuation application of U.S. Serial No. 07/406,992 filed September 14, 1989 (Attorney DocketM 4794) , the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Serial No. 07/406,992 was filed as International Application No. PCT/US90/04989 on August 31, 1990, and published as International Publication No. O91/04313 on April 4, 1991.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention herein relates to a viscosity-adjusted surfactant concentrate composition, particularly to a flowable, pumpable, stable surfactant concentrate consisting essentially of a mixture of an alkylpolyglyÂ¬ coside surfactant, an anionic or amphoteric surfactantSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

and an effective amount of a viscosity-adjusting agent.As indicated in U.S. Serial No. 07/406,992 noted above, anionic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants are known materials. In a manufacturing or shipping operation it is desirable in handling the surfactants that they be flowable, pumpable and stable at a viscosity to avoid difficulty in processing or shipping the compositions. However, at high concentrations of the anionic or amphoteric surfactants (above 25, and higher, 30 or 40% to about 80% concentrations by weight in water) the viscosity rapidly increases and forms gels. Accordingly, it has been necessary to provide low viscosities for processing and shipping that the solutions of the anionic or amphoteric surfactant be very dilute or have added thereto, agents which reduce the viscosity. Very dilute solutions are objectionable and undesirable from a shipping standpoint, as a large amount of water results in high freight and shipping costs which must be borne by the customer. It is accordingly important and desirable that a means be provided for preparing highly concentrated compositions in water of anionic or amphoteric surfactants which are flowable, pumpable, pourable and stable on storage. Statement of Related ArtAlcohols, such as ethanol, have been employed in attempts to reduce the viscosity. However, alcohols introduce a flammability problem requiring additionalSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

precautions and care in handling.United States Patent 4,488,981 discloses that the addition of alkyl mono and polyglucosides having alkyl groups with six (6) carbon atoms or less in the alkyl group, to aqueous liquid detergents mixtures of
