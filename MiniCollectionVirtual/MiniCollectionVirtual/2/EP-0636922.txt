The first conductive film is a metallic film formed by adding, to its principal metallic component such as tantalum, an 

element whose atomicity is one or more greater than that of this metallic component, preferably tungsten, at a ratio 
of 0.2 to 6.0 atomic %, more preferably, 0.3 to 6.0 atomic %. The insulatin

conducting film. Letting the current density be J₂ when a bias voltage of 10V is applied to this element after a current 

of a current density of 1A/cm² is injected for 10 seconds, and the current density be J₁ when a bias voltage of 10V 
is applied without any current injection, the following equation holds approximately: equation (2)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonlinear resistance element
(in particular, to an MIM element) that is suitable for use as a
pixel-switching element of a liquid crystal display device of a
laptop computer, engineering workstation (EWS), or liquid crystal
TV, and a method of manufacturing such a nonlinear resistance
element.Recently, there have been many attempts to replace the prior art
CRTs used in laptop computers, EWSs, mini-TVs and the like with
liquid crystal display devices, to reduce the dimensions, weight,
and power consumptions of such equipment.Various types of element are used as pixel-switching elements
in these liquid crystal display devices, such as a three-terminal
thin film transistor (TFT) using polysilicon or amorphous silicon,
or a two-terminal nonlinear resistance element of a metal-insulator-metal
(MIM) structure. Since the manufacture of TFT and
other similar three-terminal elements necessitates the repeated
formation of thin films on the structure, these manufacturing
processes are complicated and, for reasons such as the presence
of intersections between signal lines on the substrate, element
defects can easily occur, causing the problem of deteriorated
yield. In contrast, a two-terminal element such as an MIM element
has a simpler manufacturing process than a three-terminal element,
so that yield is increased, and, since there are no intersections
between signal lines, it is attracting attention because it can 
be made less expensively with a larger area, and so it is
currently being improved on and developed.An MIM element has a structure of two electrically conductive
thin films sandwiching an insulator thin film, and the voltage-current
characteristic between the electrically conductive thin
films is nonlinear. A typical MIM element has a tantalum(Ta) -
tantalum oxide(Ta2O5) - chrome(Cr) structure and is usually
manufactured by the method described below. First, after a thin
Ta film has been formed by sputtering on a glass substrate, it is
etched to leave timing signal lines and MIM element portions.
Next, a Ta2O5 insulating layer is formed on the surface of the
thin Ta film by an anodization method. Anodization is a favorable
method in forming an insulating layer that is finer than
sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), with few pinholes.
Next, a Cr thin film is formed by sputtering and is then
patterned, and then an electrode pattern for driving the liquid
crystal is formed of a transparent conductive film of indium tin
oxide (ITO).In order to achieve a high
