<ABSTRACT>
A crystalline polyol composition having improved 
cariogenic properties derived from at least one mono- 

or polysaccharide having at least one phosphopeptide 
compound or salt thereof uniformly dispersed within its 

crystal structure is disclosed. Also disclosed is a 
method of producing such a crystalline polyol 

composition by the controlled crystallization of the 
molten sugar alcohol having the phosphopeptide compound 

or salt thereof dispersed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crystalline polyol 
compositions having improved cariogenic properties 
comprising at least one crystalline sugar alcohol, 
having uniformly dispersed within its crystalline 
structure at least one phosphopeptide compound or salt 
thereof, and to a method of producing such crystalline 
polyol compositions. It is known that some phosphopeptide compounds 
(the term phosphopeptide compounds is meant to include 
phosphopeptide salts) are useful for inhibiting caries 
and gingivitis. It is also known that polyols, in particular 
sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol have been utilized in a 
variety of food-confectionery-pharmaceutical formulations 
which have been marketed to the consumer as 
products, which promote dental hygiene through the 
reduction of dental caries. To achieve maximum benefit from the incorporation 
of the phosphopeptides into food-confectionery products, 
oral pH should be maintained as close to neutral 
as possible and above a pH of 5 for any benefit at all. 
Maintenance of a neutral pH is difficult to achieve in 
food-confectionery and pharmaceutical systems where 
"conventional sugars" constitute a large percentage of 
the "finished formulation". Oral bacteria utilize the 
carbohydrates as a source of energy and excrete lactic 
acid, lowering oral pH resulting in demineralization of 
tooth enamel with subsequent tooth decay. The rate of 
demineralization of the enamel is directly related to 
the amount of time the dental enamel is exposed to low 
oral pH (<5.5). Traditionally complex and difficult  
 
buffering of sucrose-based food-confectionery products 
was done to minimize the drop in oral pH during 
consumption of these food-confectionery and pharmaceutical 
products. A reduction in dental caries has been 
achieved by substituting sugar alcohols for the 
conventional sugars. The reduction in dental caries is achieved by 
virtue of the fact that the sugar alcohols are not 
metabolized by the common microflora found in the oral 
cavity (s. mutans) which results in very little acid 
generation to lower the oral pH. pH telemetry studies 
have shown that the use of sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, 
or combinations thereof in sucrose-free gum, tablet, or 
candy formulation results in oral pH maintenance in the 
5.8 to 7.1 range, the optimum range for maximum control 
of calcium deposition from saturated oral solutions of 
calcium phosphate. Thus, a crystallized polyol 
composition containing one or more selected polyols and 
at least one phosphopeptide would provide
