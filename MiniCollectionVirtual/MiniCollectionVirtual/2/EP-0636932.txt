<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a substrate having on the surface thereof 
window-shaped coating films and a frame-shaped, functional 
coating film having light-screening properties at 
the regions not occupied with the window-shaped coating 
films. The method of the present invention is particularly 
useful for producing a color filter used in a 
color liquid crystal display (LCD), which has window-shaped, 
colored coating films and a frame-shaped coating 
film having a function of screening unnecessary lights 
or achieving other desirable properties. This method is 
particularly useful for production of a color filter, 
which is used in a matrix type color display formed 
using a thin film transistor (TFT) and a color filter. Liquid crystal displays have so far been used 
for goods with a small-sized display such as the so-called 
pocket-sized television. However, the size of 
liquid crystal displays has rapidly been enlarged in 
recent years. The image quality of liquid crystal 
displays has also been improved by the development from 
TN liquid crystals to STN liquid crystals and active 
driving elements exemplified by TFT, which has enabled 
the commercialization of goods with a liquid crystal 
display having as high image quality as cathode-ray 
tubes. Various studies have been conducted for  
 
improving the image quality and productivity of the 
color displays using TFT. Of these studies, the method 
for forming a light screening film called a black matrix 
that prevents light leakage toward TFT and improves the 
image quality (apparent contrast) and the shape of the 
light screening film are of great concern. As the method for forming a frame-shaped, 
functional film at the regions not occupied with 
colored, window-shaped films for the production of a 
color filter used for colorization of LCD, there are 
known methods utilizing printing techniques such as silk 
screen method or offset method. There is also known a method for forming a 
functional coating film as a black matrix in the gaps of 
stripe-form colored coating films, which comprises 
forming stripe-form colored coating films on a plurality 
of parallel stripe-form conductive circuits arranged on 
a transparent substrate by an electro-deposition method; 
forming a negative photoresist film capable of giving a 
functional coating film on the whole surface of the 
substrate so as to cover the stripe-form colored coating 
films; exposing the photoresist film to light from the 
opposite side of the
