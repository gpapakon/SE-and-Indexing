<ABSTRACT>
Process for purification of an aqueous effluent including at least one oxidation stage aimed at removing, at least partially, the organic matter present in the said effluent, characterised in that the said oxidation stage consists in injecting at least one powerful oxidising reactant into the said effluent in the presence of at least one adsorbing support, the said organic matter adsorbed on the said support being thus more easily oxidised by the said oxidising reactant. The invention also relates to a plant for making use of such a process, including at least one processing column (1) which has at least one entry (2) for the said effluent and at least one exit (3) for the said effluent, the said effluent passing continuously through the said column (1), characterised in that the said column (1) is at least partially filled with an adsorbing support (4) making it possible to retain at least a portion of the organic matter present in the said effluents passing through the said column (1), the said plant including means for injecting (5) into the said column (1) an oxidising reactant making it possible to oxidise the organic matter retained on the said adsorbing support.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the purification of an aqueous effluent loaded with organic matter,
comprising the steps entailing passing the said aqueous effluent to be purified through

at least one treatment column (1) containing at least one sorbent support and oxidising
the said organic matter by injection of at least one oxidising compound,

characterised in that the said sorbent support is chosen so as to be inert with
respect to the said oxidising agent, and characterised by:


a first phase having a duration of between 1 and 60 minutes, during which the
effluent passes into the said column,


either in the absence of injection of the said oxidising compound,
or while carrying out co-injection of the said oxidising compound and of at
least one decomposing element or of at least one strong reducing agent enabling the said

oxidising compound to be destroyed,

the said first phase enabling the said organic matter to be concentrated on the said
sorbent support without oxidising said organic matter,
a second phase having a duration of between 1 and 60 minutes, during which the
effluent passes into the same column and during which the oxidising compound

is injected without co-injection of decomposing element or of strong reducing
agent, the said second phase enabling the said organic matter concentrated on the

said sorbent support to be oxidised.
Purification method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said
oxidising agent is ozone.
Purification method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that
the said sorbent support is chosen from the group comprising passivated active charcoal,

activated alumina, copper oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide,
taken on their own and in combination.
Purification method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the said decomposing element is a reagent chosen from the group comprising hydrogen

peroxide, soda, lime, sodium sulphite, sodium hyposulphite and sulphur dioxide.
Purification method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the decomposing element comprises ultraviolet or ultrasonic radiation.
Purification method according to one of Claims 2 to 5, characterised in that
the ozone is injected in an amount such in the said effluent that (sic) the ozone/Chemical

Oxygen Demand ratio is between approximately 0.10 g/g and 2 g/g.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that it is carried
out in an installation comprising at least one treatment column (1) having at least one

inlet (2) for the said effluent and at least one outlet (3) for the said effluent, the said
column (1) being at least partially filled with a sorbent support (4) enabling at least

some of the organic matter contained in the said effluents passing into the said column
(1) to be retained, the said installation comprising means for injection (5) into the said

column (1) of a reagent enabling the organic matter retained in the said sorbent support
(4) to be oxidised, the said sorbent support being inert with respect to the said oxidising

agent.
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that the said inlet (2), the said
outlet (3) and the said means for injection (5) of oxidising agents are designed such that

the flow of the said effluents into the said column (1) takes place in co-current with
injection of the said oxidising agent.
Method according to Claim 8, characterised in that the said inlet (2) for the
effluents and the said means for injection (5) of the oxidising agent are provided at the

bottom of the column, the outlet for the effluents (3) being provided at the top of the
column.
Method according to one of Claims 7 to 9, characterised in that it is carried
out in at least two columns (1, 1a) installed in series, each of the two columns being at

least partially filled with a sorbent support (4, 4a) and provided with means for injection
(5, 5a) of the oxidising agent.
Method according to Claim 10, characterised in that it comprises a step
entailing alternate feeding of the means for injection (5, 5a) of oxidising agent for the

first column (1) and the means for injection of oxidising agent for the second column
(1a), such that the injection of ozone will take place only in one of the two columns (1,

1a) at a time. 
Method according to Claim 11, characterised in that it comprises a step
entailing passing the effluent alternately either first into the first column (1) and then

into the second column (1a) or first into the second column (1a) and then into the first
column (1).
Method according to one of Claims 7 or 8, characterised in that it is carried
out in at least two columns installed in parallel (1, 1b), the means for injection of the

oxidising agent operating alternately in the one and the other column.
Method according to one of Claims 7 or 8, characterised in that it is carried
out in at least two columns installed in parallel (1, 1b), the effluent passing alternately

into the first and into the second column, the means for injection of the oxidising agent
operating alternately in the one and the other column when the said effluent is not

passing into the said column.
Method according to one of Claims 7 to 14, characterised in that the said
column or columns (1, 1a, 1b) are provided with means for injection of a decomposing

element enabling the residues of oxidising agent to be destroyed.
