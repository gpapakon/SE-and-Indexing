<CLAIMS>
DNA that codes for a protein with D-hydantoinase
activity and is selected from the group


a) the DNA sequence shown in the sequence SEQ ID NO 2
or the complementary DNA sequence thereto,
b) DNA sequences which due to the degeneracy of the
genetic code, code for a protein according to

SEQ ID NO 1 which is also coded by one of the
sequences defined in a).
DNA as claimed in claim 1 which has the sequence
SEQ ID NO 2.
Use of a DNA as claimed in claim 1 or 2 to produce
a heatstable enzyme with D-hydantoinase activity.
Prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell that is
transformed with a DNA sequence as claimed in

claims 1 or 2 in such a way that the host cell
expresses the protein coded by this DNA sequence.
Host cell as claimed in claim 4, wherein this is an
E. coli cell or a Saccharomyces cell.
DNA vector containing a sequence as claimed in
claims 1 or 2. 
Process for the production of a recombinant
D-hydantoinase by transforming a suitable host cell

with a DNA as claimed in claims 1 or 2 in a
suitable expression system, culturing the

transformed host cells and isolating the
D-hydantoinase that forms from the cells or the

cell supernatant.
