least one photosensitive silver halide layer and in 

or adjacent said silver halide layer a colour 
coupler of one of the general formulae: 


   wherein R¹ is a subsituted or unsubstituted 
aryl or a subsituted or unsubstituted heterocylic 

group,
 

      R² is a subsituted or unsubstituted, 
saturated or unsaturated, primary or secondary alkyl 

group in which the carbon atom which joins R² to 
rest of the coupler has at least one fluorine atom 

attached to it,

and

 
      X is H or a coupling-off group,

are such that the dye formed on coupling with oxidised 
colour developing agent 4-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylphenylenediamine

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic colour
couplers and in particular to a class of magenta
couplers.Colour couplers are known to belong to a number
of classes, for example magenta dye-forming couplers
can be pyrazolones, pyrazolotriazoles and
pyrazolobenzimidazoles while yellow dye-forming
couplers can be acetanilides.There is always a need for new classes of
couplers that have advantages over those already known
to the art.According to the present invention there are
provided photographic elements comprising a support,
at least one photosensitive silver halide layer and in
or adjacent said silver halide layer a colour coupler
of one of the general formulae:

wherein
R1 is a subtituted aryl or a subtituted
heterocylic group, and X is H or a coupling-off group,
characterised in that
R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted,
saturated or unsaturated, primary or
secondary alkyl group in which the carbon
atom which joins R2 to the rest of the coupler
has at least one fluorine atom attached to
it,R3 is an electron-withdrawing group,
and wherein the electron-withdrawing properties of R1
are such that the dye formed on coupling with oxidised
colour developing agent 4-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylphenylenediamine
(CD4) has a λmax of from 537
to 570 nm when measured in a coupler dispersion
comprising 6% w/w gelatin, 8.8% coupler and coupler
solvents in the ratio:- coupler : tricresyl phosphate
: 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl acetate 1.0 : 0.5 : 1.5
(w/w) and in which the auxiliary solvent (2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl
acetate) is removed by washing the
dispersion for 6 hours at 4°C and pH 6.0.The present invention provides a new class of
couplers capable of forming magenta dyes having
desirable spectral characteristics having maximum
wavelength (λmax) in the range from 537 to 570 nm.The present couplers fall within the broad scope
of the couplers claimed in our copending PCT
Application No. EP92/02293. The methods of synthesis
described therein are not suitable for preparing the
compounds of the present invention. Examples of electron-withdrawing substituent groups for R1 are
listed below under R3. Particularly preferred
electron-withdrawing substituents for R1 are cyano,
nitro, alkylsulphonyl and arylsulphonyl.Examples of groups which R2 may represent are
trifluoromethyl, nonafluorobutyl and trifluoroethylene
groups. R3 may be an electron withdrawing group wherein
the value of the Hammett substituent constant σp
(SIGMAp as defined by Hansch et al, J. Med.
Chem.,1973, 16, 1207; and ibid. 1977, 20, 304) is 0.03
or
