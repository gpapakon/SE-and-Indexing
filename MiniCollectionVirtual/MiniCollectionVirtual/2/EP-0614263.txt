<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-phase reluctance motor, especially a reluctance motor which is formed from a stationary component (3) and a component (5) which can move with respect to said stationary component (3) (stator and rotor), which components enclose an air gap between them and one of which has a ferromagnetic body (5a) (through which a magnetic field can pass) with salient pole parts (5b) and the other has a ferromagnetic body which can be energised electrically and has salient pole parts (5a), one of the ferromagnetic components (5) through which a magnetic field can pass being constructed in such a manner that it has first regions (I) distributed along the air gap circumference, which first regions (I) have a low saturation inductance, and second regions (II) which have a higher saturation inductance, which regions result in a possibly matched position of the moving component now being unmatched by the influence of the different saturation properties as the excitation current rises, and the moving component starting to rotate in the direction of the new matched position.

A single-phase reluctance motor comprising a stationary member (3)

(stator) and a movable member (5) (rotor) which is movable relative to said stationary
member, between which members an air gap is formed, one member comprising a

magnetically permeable ferromagnetic body (5a) having salient pole parts (5b) and the
other member comprising an electrically excitable ferromagnetic body having salient

pole parts (5a), one of the permeable ferromagnetic members (5) being constructed in
such a manner that it comprises first areas (I) having a low saturation induction and

second areas (II) having a higher saturation induction, as result of which an aligned
position of the movable member becomes non-aligned at increasing excitation current

under the influence of the different saturation characteristics and the movable member
begins to rotate towards a new aligned position, 
characterized in that
 the first and the
second areas (I, II) are formed from magnetically permeable ferromagnetic materials

with different saturation characteristics, partitioned superficially along the air-gap
circumference, and said areas may be provided both in the rotor and in the stator.
A single-phase reluctance motor comprising a stationary member (3)
(stator) and a movable member (5) (rotor) which is movable relative to said stationary

member, between which members an air gap is formed, one member comprising a
magnetically permeable ferromagnetic body (5a) having salient pole parts (5b) and the

other member comprising an electrically excitable ferromagnetic body having salient
pole parts (5a), one of the permeable ferromagnetic members (5) being constructed in

such a manner that it comprises, partitioned along the air-gap circumference, first areas
(I) having a low saturation induction and second areas (II) having a higher saturation

induction, as result of which an aligned position of the movable member becomes non-aligned
at increasing excitation current under the influence of the different saturation

characteristics and the movable member begins to rotate towards a new aligned position,

characterized in that
 the ferromagnetic member without excitation winding has radial
slots (5c), partitioned superficially along the air-gap circumference, at the location of

the salient pole parts (5b) and the width of the ferromagnetic webs (5dI) between the 
slots in the first areas (I) of lower saturation induction is smaller than the width of the

webs (5dII) between the slots (5c) in the areas (II) of higher saturation induction.
A single-phase reluctance motor as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the air gap width in at least a part of the second areas (II) is larger than in the
first areas (I).
