<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a set of concrete slabs for laying paths, having slabs of a differing predetermined width and different lengths, each set comprising a plurality of groups, and all the slabs contained in one group being of the same width, that being of a different length, which is defined by a multiple of a unit dimension, and the sum of the length of the slabs of each group giving the same variable, which defines the path length and can be divided by the unit dimension. By means of such a set, path laying using natural stones can be copied virtually undetectably. This is the case, in particular, if, according to the invention, the set comprises from two to five groups, of which each group has a multiplicity of slabs with preferably from three to six different slab lengths.

Construction set of concrete slabs for laying 
paving, having slabs of a specific given width and 

different lengths, each construction set consisting of a 
plurality of set packs and all the slabs contained in 

one set pack having the same width, the slabs contained 
in one set pack having a different length determined as 

a multiple of a grid dimension, and the sum of the 
lengths of the slabs in each set pack giving the same 

magnitude which determines the length of the paved area 
and is divisible by the grid dimension, characterised in 

that the multiple of the grid dimension is selected so 
as to produce in each pack a combination of both whole 

number values, non-whole number values and fractions in 
cm for the slab lengths. 
Construction set according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the construction set consists of 

three set packs having slab widths of 14, 21 and 28 cm, 
and in that the slab lengths are between one and two 

times the slab width, taking into account the multiple 
of a grid dimension of 3.5 cm. 
Construction set according to claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised in that the construction set consists of 

two to five set packs, each of which contains a 
plurality of slabs with preferably three to six 

different slab lengths.
