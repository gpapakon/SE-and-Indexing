<ABSTRACT>
A modified polyisocyanurate foam is produced by 
reacting an organic polyisocyanate, a polyol and water in 

the presence of three catalyst, i.e. two particular 
trimerization catalysts and a carbodiimidation catalyst. 

There can be produced, without using any evaporating type 
blowing agent, a modified polyisocyanurate foam which is 

suitably used for continuous production of laminate 
boards, siding boards, insulation boards, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
a modified polyisocyanurate foam and, more particularly,
to a process for producing a modified polyisocyanurate
foam suitable for continuous production of
laminate boards, insulation boards and the like which
process does not involve the use of evaporating type
blowing agent such as CFC, HCFC, HFC, pentane and methylene
chloride.It is known to produce a modified polyisocyanurate
foam by reacting an organic polyisocyanate and a
polyol in the presence of a blowing agent and using an
trimerization catalyst and a carbodiimidation catalyst in
combination (cf., for example, U.S. Patent No.
3,657,161). It has also been proposed to produce a
modified polyisocyanurate foam by reacting an organic
polyisocyanate and a polyol in the presence of a blowing
agent and using methanol, furfuryl alcohol or phosphorene
oxide (carbodiimidation catalyst) and an alkali metal
salt (trimerization catalyst) in combination (U.S. Patent
No. 4,166,164, and European Patent No. 381,324). U.S.
Patent No. 3,887,501, U.S. Patent No. 3,928,256, U.S.
Patent No. 3,998,776, U.S. Patent No. 3,994,837, U.S.
Patent No. 3,981,829, U.S. Patent No. 3,994,839 and so on
have reported a process for producing modified polyisocyanurate
foam using a tertiary amine and an alcohol such
as an amino alcohol as cocatalysts, a process in which a
Mannich polyol, a phosphorus containing polyol or the
like is used catalytically, a method in which s-triazine
and phenol are used.For producing these (modified) polyisocyanurate
foams, it is a general measure to use flon as a blowing
agent. However, the use of CFCs has a problem of breaking
the ozone layer, and in near future the use of CFC 
and HCFC will be prohibited completely. While there is a
possibility to use carbon dioxide gas generated by the
reaction between water and isocyanate as a substitute for
CFC, this is disadvatageous since increase in the amount
of water with view to making low density foam leads to
increase in the amount of urea bonds generated (-NCO+H2O
→ -NH2+CO2 ↑, -NH2+OCN- → -NHCONH-), and therefore
there arises a problem of giving only those foams that
have low strength, deteriorated dimensional stability,
and poor adherability with surface materials. Also, in
the above-described conventional method using an trimerization
catalyst and a carbodiimidation catalyst in combination,
it is difficult to control the reaction when
water is used as a blowing agent, and in particular, it
is impossible to produce, at economically acceptable
speeds, a
