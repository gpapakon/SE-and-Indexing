<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods for modulating the activity of RNA are provided. Oligonucleotides are hybridized with an RNA structure to form a stable heteroduplex so that the RNA is no longer recognized by its regulatory protein after oligonucleotide binding. Reactive moieties can be tethered to the oligonucleotide that enhance its activity. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against HIV TAR are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and methods for
modulating the activity of RNA. Oligonucleotides are
hybridized with RNA in accordance with novel motifs to effect
modulation of RNA activity.Many investigators designing antisense
oligonucleotides or ribozymes to inhibit specific RNA's
generally avoid targeting regions with strong secondary
structure to facilitate hybridization. E. Wickstrom, W.S.
Simonet, K. Medlock, I. Ruiz-Robles, Biophys. J. 49, 15 (1986).
However, structured RNA's generally contain single stranded
portions which are available for base pairing; there may be
thermodynamic, kinetic or functional advantages to targeting
these regions. For example, natural antisense recognition
systems in E. coli involve bimolecular interactions between two
highly structured hairpin loops which have fast hybridization
rates. Y. Eguchi, T. Itoh, J. Tomizawa, Annu. Rev. Biochem.
60, 631 (1991).specific regulatory proteins often recognize
structured RNA regions such as the HIV TAR and RRE elements.

package only the viral genome by binding to structured RNA
regions, M. Junker-Niepmann, R. Bartenschlager, H. Schaller,
EMBO J. 9, 3389 (1990). Enhanced biological specificity can
be obtained by targeting these regions. The cell will contain
many non-target RNA sequences to which the antisense compounds
are either closely or precisely complementary. Although
ribozymes bind and cleave their target RNA, other antisense
molecules do not cleave their target and may not produce
significant biological effects unless they compete effectively
with a biomolecule for the target site. There are currently no
reliable methods for determining accessible target sites.In view of the potential advantages of binding to
structured RNA's, compositions and methods for binding to
structured regions are desired.It is an object of the invention to provide
compositions for modulating the

A method for preparing an oligonucleotide capable of hybridizing with a target RNA
having at least one stem-loop structure comprisi
ng:

a) selecting an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the loop and stem
portion of either the 3' or 5' side of said stem-loop structure;
b) determining the ability of the selected oligonucleotide to form half a pseudoknot
with said stem-loop structure;

   wherein said half a pseudoknot structure is a fold comprising two coaxially
stacked stems, one of which stems is substantially present in the targeted

stem-loop structure and the other stem is formed by the binding of the
selected oligonucleotide to either the 5' or 3' side of the loop region of the

targeted stem-loop structure, and a single loop region which crosses either
the major groove or minor groove of the newly-formed coaxially stacked

region, and which is topologically similar to half of a pseudoknot; and

   wherein said oligonucleotide is considered to form half a pseudoknot with
said stem-loop structure if:


i) the sum (ΔG°
4
) of the free energy for disrupting the
predicted secondary structure of the RNA (ΔG°
1
) and the free
energy for disrupting the predicted secondary structure of the

oligonucleotide molecule (ΔG°
2
) and the free energy for binding of
the oligonucleotide and the RNA (ΔG°
3
), predicted using RNA
folding rules, is less than zero kcal per mole; and
ii) the enzymatic cleavage of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex by single-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes reveals

that nucleotide residues located within the loop region of the
targeted stem-loop structure sensitive to cleavage by single-strand-specific

RNA cleavage enzymes are protected from cleavage by
single-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes after binding of the

oligonucleotide; and

   the enzymatic cleavage of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex by double-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes reveals 

that other nucleotide residues located within the stem region of the
targeted stem-loop structure sensitive to cleavage by double-strand-specific

RNA cleavage enzymes remain sensitive to cleavage by
double-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes after binding of the

oligonucleotide; or
iii) the enzymatic cleavage of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex by double-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes reveals

that nucleotide residues located within the stem region, and adjacent
to the loop region, of the targeted stem-loop structure insensitive to

cleavage by single-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes become
sensitive to cleavage by single-strand-specific RNA cleavage

enzymes after binding of the oligonucleotide; and

   the enzymatic cleavage of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex by double-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes reveals

that other nucleotide residues located within the stem region of the
targeted stem-loop structure sensitive to cleavage by double-strand-specific

RNA cleavage enzymes remain sensitive to cleavage by
double-strand-specific RNA cleavage enzymes after binding of the

oligonucleotide; or
iv) analysis of chemical cleavage of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex reveals that an oligonucleotide-attached chemical

cleavage moiety is located in a position within the oligonucleotide-stem-loop
complex consistent with the formation of a half a

pseudoknot structure; or
v) analysis of the oligonucleotide-stem-loop complex by optical melt
analysis reveals that the oligonucleotide-stem-loop complex has

multiple discrete absorbance transitions consistent with the multistep
melting of a half a pseudoknot structure;

pseudoknot with said stem-loop structure, synthesizing the selected

oligonucleotide.

responsive element.

group, or to a heterocycle ring of a nucleoside base.

selected which are complementary to said stem-loop structure, determinations of the

ability of each of said plurality to form half a pseudoknot with said stem-loop structure
are made, and the oligonucleotide found to have the greatest ability to form said half

pseudoknot structure is synthesized.
An 
in vitro
 method for modulating the expression of a selected RNA having at least
one stem-loop structure comprising performing the steps recited in any of the preceding

claims, additionally including a further step comprising contacting the RNA with the
selected oligonucleotide.
