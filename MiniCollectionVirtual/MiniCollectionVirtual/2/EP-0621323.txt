<ABSTRACT>
A cathodic electrodeposition paint containing as a 
binder resin an amine-epoxy resin adduct and a blocked 

polyisocyanate crosslinker is disclosed. The binder resin 
and the crosslinker are emulsified in an aqueous medium 

containing a neutralizing agent with the aid of amine 
adduct of a monoepoxide compound having a hydrophobic group 

or block. Not only the amine-monoepoxide adduct functions 
as a surfactant but also it is deposited electrically and 

then cured with the crosslinker integrally with the binder 
resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cathodic electrodeposition 
paints containing cationic modified epoxy resins and blocked 
polyisocyanate crosslinkers in the form of an emulsion. Cationic modified epoxy resins used in cathodic 
electrodeposition paint formulations are produced by 
reacting a starting epoxy resin with an amine to open the 
epoxy group with the amine in order to render the resin 
hydrophilic and cationically chargeable. The resulting 
amine-modified resin and a crosslinker such as blocked 
polyisocyanates are then emulsified in an aqueous medium 
containing a neutralizing agent for use in the 
electrodeposition coating process. The amine-modified epoxy resins of this type perse 
are not easily emulsifiable in the aqueous medium and thus 
require a surfactant. It has been discovered that even when 
emulsified with the aid of conventional surfactants, the 
resin may only be emulsified into particles of relatively 
large particle sizes which tend to settle upon standing. The present invention utilizes in lieu of or in 
addition to conventional surfactants a unique component to  
 
emulsify amine-modified epoxy resins for cathodic 
electrodeposition paints. This unique component is an amine 
adduct of a monoepoxide compound having a hydrophobic group 
or block. This component is capable of depositing 
electrically onto a metallic substrate and thus forms a film 
integrally with the binder resin while serving as a 
surfactant to emulsify the binder resin into fine 
particles. Accordingly, the present invention provides a cathodic 
electrodeposition paint comprising: 
(a) a cationic modified epoxy resin produced by the 
addition reaction of an epoxy resin having a plurality of 
epoxy groups in the molecule and a primary or secondary 
amine; (b) 0.1 to 10 weight parts per 100 weight parts of said 
modified epoxy resin of an adduct of monoepoxide compound 
having a hydrophobic group or block and a primary or 
secondary amine; and (c) a blocked polyisocyanate compound;  
   said components (a), (b) and (c) being emulsified in an 
aqueous medium containing a neutralizing agent. With the exception of the monoepoxide-amine adduct, the 
cathodic paint of the present invention may be otherwise 
identical to known epoxy-based cathodic paints. The monoepoxide-amine adduct is produced by addition-reacting  
 
a monoepoxide having a hydrophobic group or block 
and a primary or secondary amine. Since the amine moiety of 
the adduct is hydrophilic in nature, the adduct meets the 
structural requirement for
