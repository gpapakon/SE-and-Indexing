<ABSTRACT>
Output overvoltage protection circuitry for circuits operating at low 
voltages (e.g., 3v) interfacing to a higher voltage operating circuit (e.g., 5v bus). To 

prevent problems with a pull-up PMOS device at the output when the bus is pulled-up 
to the higher voltage, a voltage node is provided in the circuit which follows the output 

voltage or the low supply voltage, whichever is higher, and means are provided to 
generate logic signals indicating when the bus is pulled too high. Means in response to 

the voltage node or the logic signals becomes operative to shut-down the PMOS device 
to prevent damage to the circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic device comprising:
a first circuit having a FET with a conduction channel between a supply node and an output node,
and with a gate and a back gate;an overvoltage protection circuit coupled to at least the back
gate for protecting the first circuit against overvoltages when the output node is coupled
to a second circuit operating with a voltage that is higher than a voltage at the supply
node.Such a device is known from US patent application No.4,789,917. This
circuit is intended specifically for the case that no power is supplied to the (positive)
supply node. In this case the positive supply node will approach ground potential.
Conventionally, the back gate is connected to the supply node. When a positive voltage
is applied to the output node when the back gate of the transistor is fixed at a lower
voltage this results in a forward biased p-n junction from output to supply voltage Vcc
creating very large, undesirable, output-to-supply node currents.To solve this problem the mentioned publication provides for a pair of
FETs with conduction channels coupled between on one hand the back gate and on the
other hand the supply node and the output node respectively. The gates of these FETs
are cross-coupled to output node and the supply node respectively. Thus the voltage at
the output node will be applied to the backgate when that voltage is higher than the
voltage at the supply node.Due to the increasing use of electronic circuitry operating with a supply
voltage of 3 volts alongside of electronic circuitry operating with a 5 volts supply
voltage, some parts of an electronic system may operate with 3-volt DC power sources,
whereas other parts of the system may operate with 5-volt power sources. As an
example, 3-volt IC's are needed which can interface with 5-volt busses. Standard
complementary MOS (CMOS) and combined bipolar-CMOS (BiCMOS) outputs run into
trouble in these applications due to the PMOS devices in their pull-up circuitry.Three major problems are encountered with such parts when the bus to
which they are connected is pulled towards 5 volts: (1) the drain of the PMOS is pulled
towards 5 volts and with its back gate fixed at 3 volts (or Vcc < 5 volts) this results in
a forward biased p-n junction from output to Vcc creating very large, undesirable, 
output-to-Vcc currents; (2) the PMOS device, with its gate held to 3 volts (or Vcc < 5
volts), cannot be turned off completely because the drain at the output has become the
source, and the resulting
