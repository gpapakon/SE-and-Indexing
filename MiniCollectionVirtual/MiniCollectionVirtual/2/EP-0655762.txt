<ABSTRACT>
A shadow mask (25) of a color cathode-ray tube 
includes a mask body (26) in the form of a substantially 

rectangular curved surface. The mask body has a center, 
horizontal and vertical axes perpendicularly crossing 

each other at the center, long sides extending in 
parallel to the horizontal axis, and short sides 

extending in parallel to the vertical axis. In a region 
of the mask body which is adjacent to the vertical axis, 

the radius of curvature in the vertical direction is 
smaller at portions of the mask body which are near the 

long sides than at the central portion of the mask body. 
In a intermediate region of the mask body between the 

vertical axis and each short side, the radius of 
curvature in the vertical direction is larger at the 

portions of the mask body which are near the long sides 
than at a portion adjacent to the horizontal axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode-ray 
tube of the shadow mask type and, more particularly, 
to a color cathode-ray tube capable of preventing images 
on the phosphor screen from being deteriorated by a 
thermal expansion of the shadow mask. Generally, a color cathode-ray tube comprises an 
envelope which includes a panel having a substantially 
rectangular effective surface formed of essentially a 
curved surface and a skirt portion provided at the 
periphery of the effective surface, and a funnel 
attached to the skirt portion of the panel. A phosphor 
screen comprising three-color phosphor layers which emit 
blue, green and red is formed on the inner side of the 
panel effective surface, and a substantially rectangular 
shadow mask is arranged inside and opposed to the 
phosphor screen. The shadow mask includes a mask body 
in the form of a curved surface and having a plurality 
of electron beam apertures in its area which is opposed 
to the phosphor screen, and a mask frame attached to the 
outer peripheral portion of the mask body. An electron gun for emitting three electron beams 
is arranged in a neck of the funnel. Three electron 
beams emitted from the electron gun are deflected by 
magnetic field generated by a deflection yoke on the 
funnel and horizontally and vertically scan the phosphor 
screen through the shadow mask, thereby displaying  
 
a color image on the screen. In order to display color images of good color 
purity on the phosphor screen, in the color cathode-ray 
tube constructed in this manner, the phosphor screen and 
the shadow mask must be arranged each other in a 
predetermined matching relation so that the three 
electron beams passing through the electron beam apertures 
of the shadow mask and entering into the phosphor 
screen correctly land on their corresponding three-color 
phosphor layers. To achieve this, it is important that, 
especially, the distance (or value q) between the inner 
face of the panel and the shadow mask is securely set as 
a designed value. Even when the phosphor screen and the shadow mask 
are correctly arranged with respect to each other in the predetermined 
matching relation, however, the color cathode-ray tube 
deteriorates its color purity because of the thermal 
expansion of the shadow mask. Specifically, that area 
of the shadow mask in which the electron beam apertures 
are formed is smaller than 1/3 of the total area of the 
mask body. Most of electron beams, therefore, impinge 
against the shadow mask to thereby heat it.

<CLAIMS>
A color cathode-ray tube comprising: 

a substantially rectangular panel (22) having a 

curved inner surface; 
a phosphor screen (24) formed on the inner surface 
of the panel; and 
a shadow mask (25) including a mask body (26) 
having a plurality of electron beam apertures and being 

in the form of a substantially rectangular curved surface 
opposing to the phosphor screen, and a mask frame 

(27) attached to the peripheral portion of the mask 
body, the 

mask body (26) having a center (O) through which 
a tube axis passes, a horizontal axis (X) passing 

through the center and perpendicular to the tube axis, 
a vertical axis (Y) passing through the center and perpendicular 

to the tube and horizontal axes, long sides 
extending in parallel to the horizontal axis, and short 

sides extending in parallel to the vertical axis; 
characterised in that: 
the mask body is formed such that, in a region of 
the mask body which is adjacent to the vertical axis, 

the radius of curvature in a direction of the vertical 
axis is smaller at portions of the mask body which are 

near the long sides than at the central portion of the 
mask body and such that, in a region of the mask body 

which is located substantially intermediate between 
the vertical axis and each short side, the radius of 

curvature in a direction of the vertical axis is 
larger at the portions of the mask body which are near 

the long sides than at a portion adjacent to the horizontal 
axis. 
A color cathode-ray tube according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the radius of curvature in the 

direction of the vertical axis (Y) at a portion near the 
horizontal axis (X) in said intermediate region is  

 
smaller than that at the central portion of the mask 

body (26).
