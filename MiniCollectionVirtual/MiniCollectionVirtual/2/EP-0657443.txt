<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optically active 
carboxamide derivatives having potent analgesic activity 
and low toxicity, or to pharmacologically acceptable salts 
thereof. In the central nervous system, the presence of three 
kinds of receptors, µ-, k- and δ-receptors, 
participating in analgesic effect has been clarified. It 
is said that an agonist which has an affinity to 
k-receptor among these shows strong analgesic effect and 
does not show such side effects as addiction, tolerance 
formation, respiratory inhibition, inhibition of smooth 
muscle movement and so on which are observed, for example, 
in µ-receptor agonistic morphine etc. Accordingly, the 
development of a k-receptor agonist having a strong 
analgesic activity and fewer side effects has been desired. The present inventors have synthesized a series of 
heterocyclic compounds and examined their pharmacological 
activities for many years. As a result, they have found  
 
carboxamide derivatives or their pharmacologically 
acceptable salts thereof having potent analgesic activity 
and filed a Japanese patent application [JP Kokai Hei 
3-163068 (Hei 3. July 15)]. The present inventors have found that optically active 
carboxamide derivatives having specific stereochemical 
configuration of the compounds covered in the above 
application exhibit much strong analgesic activity as 
k-receptor agonist comparing with racemates and the other 
stereoisomers, have fewer side effects and are practical 
as analgesic agents; and have accomplished the present 
invention. The optically active carboxamide derivatives of the 
present invention have general formula: 
   In the formula, R¹ represents a hydrogen or halogen 
atom; R² represents a halogen atom; R³ represents a 
pyrrolidino or piperidino group; Y represents a methylene 
or carbonyl group; and n is an integer of 1 or 2. An analgesic agent or a k-receptor agonistic agent of 
the present invention comprises the above compounds or 
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof as an active 
ingredient. Halogen atoms represented by R¹ and R² include, 
for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms; 
preferably a fluorine or chlorine atom; and particularly 
preferably a chlorine atom. The compounds having a general formula (I) described 
above can, if necessary, be converted to pharmacologically 
acceptable salts thereof by conventional means. Examples of such salts include: for example, salts of 
mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydroboromic 
acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric
