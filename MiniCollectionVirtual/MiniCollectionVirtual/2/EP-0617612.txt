<ABSTRACT>
A novel solid pharmaceutical dispersion that improves the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs is produced by combining the drug with a polymer carrier such as polyvinylpyrrolidone. The drug is combined with the carrier without the need for using organic solvents or melting temperatures (fusion) through the use of a transition compound such as polyethylene glycol which partially solubilizes the drug and/or plasticizes the polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The bioavailabilities of many poorly water soluble drug 
entitles are limited by their dissolution rates which in 
turn are governed by the particle size and hence the 
specific surface area and/or the polymorphic state of the 
active ingredient. At times, these problems are overcome by 
particle size reduction. There are cases, however, where 
the dissolution rates of the drug are not favorable enough 
to improve its bioavailability. Therefore, techniques such 
as lyophilization, solvent deposition, solvate formation and 
solid dispersion have been employed to improve the 
absorption of drugs. A solid dispersion is a pharmaceutical formulation 
which may be defined as "a dispersion of one or more active 
ingredients in an inert carrier or matrix at solid state 
prepared by melting the two (fusion), dissolving them in a 
solvent, or a combination of approaches, i.e., a quasi 
melting-solvent method". The solvent-based process uses 
organic solvents to dissolve and intimately disperse the 
drug and carrier molecules. The process is relatively 
difficult. Identification of a common solvent for both drug 
and carrier is a tedious exercise, and complete solvent 
removal from the product is, if at all possible, a lengthy 
process. In addition, the volume of solvents required is 
excessive, and the cost of solvent recovery systems is 
prohibitive. The drug and carrier are dissolved in a 
solvent such as methylene chloride, acetone, ethanol and 
mixtures thereof and the solvent is later removed by 
evaporation or the like while the drug/carrier solid 
dispersion is collected as a powdered mass. Not only is the 
process lengthy and expensive, but the use of organic 
solvents renders it hazardous and toxic as well.  
 The second process for the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical dispersions involves fusion of the two 
components where the drug and the carrier are allowed to 
melt at temperatures at or above the melting point of the 
drug. In the fusion process, the drug and carrier are first 
blended and melted in a suitable mixer. The molten mixture 
is then cooled rapidly to provide a congealed mass which is 
subsequently milled to produce a powder. The fusion process 
is technically simple provided that the drug and carrier are 
miscible in the molten state but this is not always the case 
and furthermore, the process is limited in that it tends to 
lead to drug decomposition due to the high temperatures 
required to melt the two components. A third method that is used to produce a solid
