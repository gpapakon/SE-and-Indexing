<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an
imidazolyl-alkenoic acid angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The pharmaceutical
compositions are useful in regulating hypertension induced or exacerbated by
angiotensin II, and in the treatment of congestive heart failure, renal failure, and
glaucoma.The class of peptide pressor hormone known as angiotensin is responsible for
a vasopressor action that is implicated in the etiology of hypertension in man.
Inappropriate activity of the renin-angiotensin systems appears to be a key element in
essential hypertension, congestive heart failure and in some forms of renal disease. In
addition to a direct action on arteries and arterioles, angiotensin II (AII), being one of
the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictors known, exerts stimulation on the release
of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin system, by
virtue of its participation in the control of renal sodium handling, plays an important
role in cardiovascular hemeostasis.Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with converting enzyme
inhibitors, such as captopril, has proved to be clinically useful in the treatment of
hypertension and congestive heart failure (Abrams, W.B., et al., (1984), Federation
Proc.,43, 1314). The most direct approach towards inhibition of the renin-angiotensin
system would block the action of AII at the receptor. Compelling
- evidence suggests that AII also contributes to renal vasoconstriction and sodium
retention that is characteristic of a number of disorders such as heart failure, cirrhosis
and complications of pregnancy (Hollenberg, N.K., (1984), J. Cardiovas. Pharmacol.,
6, S176). In addition, recent animal studies suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin
system may be beneficial in halting or slowing the progression of chronic
renal failure (Anderson, S., et al., (1985), J. Clin. Invest.,76, 612). Also, a recent
patent application (South African Patent Application No. 87/01,653) claims that AII
antagonists are useful as agents for reducing and controlling elevated intraocular
pressure, especially glaucoma, in mammals.The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention inhibit, block and
antagonize the action of the hormone AII, and are therefore useful in regulating and
moderating angiotensin induced hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure
and other disorders attributed to the actions of AII. When the pharmaceutical
compositions of this invention are administered to mammals, the elevated blood
