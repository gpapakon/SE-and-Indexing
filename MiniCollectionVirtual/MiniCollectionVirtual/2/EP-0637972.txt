<ABSTRACT>
A needle assemby (31) for medical or veterinary use, which has a needle (37) and a retractable sleeve (33) associated with the needle (37), so as to reduce the risks of accidental puncture by the needle (37) and of contamination of the exposed needle (37), and so as also to limit the penetration depth of the needle (37). The present invention also seeks to provide a skin piercing device which incorporates a skin piercing element and a desensitizing element, and which, when placed against a portion of skin to be pierced, provides desensitization of the skin so as to render a subsequent introduction into the skin of the piercing element less painful.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to skin-piercing devices for medical 
use, and to cooling devices. The piercing of skin for purposes of administering medications 
and taking blood samples is well known in medical practice. Insertion of a 
needle into the skin is known to be accompanied by a localized sensation of 
pain. Accordingly, it would be an advantage to desensitize skin into which a 
needle is being introduced. Various devices and methods are known in the prior art for local 
desensitization of skin. Among prior art publications which describe localized 
desensitization of skin are U.S. Patents Nos. 2,746,264; 2,982,112; 3,327,713; 
3,826,264; 4,614,191 and 4,646,735. U.S. Patent 3,605,742 discloses an injecting device for a 
hypodermic syringe which rapidly projects the syringe needle through a 
surface engaging end of a housing adapted to fit within the hand. An injector 
bar actuates the syringe plunger after the needle has penetrated the skin and 
tissues. Prior desensitizing of the skin by discharge of coolant from a 
pressurized contained in the housing may be utilized to reduce pain and 
irritation. The needle projecting mechanism may also be conditioned to 
produce aspiration for detecting whether the needle has penetrated a blood 
vessel, before medication is injected by the plunger.  
 There is provided, in accordance with a  
 
preferred embodiment of the invention, apparatus for piercing skin comprising 
a skin piercing needle (37) and a cooling assembly (32) associated with said 
skin piercing needle and providing for cooling a portion of skin prior to and 
during piercing thereof and by said skin piercing needle (37) and characterized 
by a skin contact surface (60) arranged to be in thermal contact with said 
portion of skin by conduction through which said cooling assembly (52) is 
operable to cool said portion of skin by thermal conduction to said cooling 
assembly. Additionally in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, the cooling assembly includes a thermoelectric cooling assembly. Alternatively, the cooling assembly may be a replaceable cooling 
element adapted to be cooled independently of the apparatus for piercing skin, 
or fluid cooled apparatus. Additionally in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, the thermoelectrically cooled surface defines an aperture through 
which the skin piercing apparatus extends. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the skin 
piercing apparatus includes a hypodermic syringe. In accordance with
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for piercing skin comprising: 

a skin piercing needle (37); and 
a cooling assembly (32) associated with said skin piercing needle 
(37) and providing for cooling a portion of skin prior to and during piercing 

thereof by said skin piercing needle (37) and 
characterized by
:
 
   a skin contact surface (60) arranged to be in thermal contact with 

said portion of skin by conduction through which said cooling assembly (52) is 
operable to cool said portion of skin by thermal conduction to said cooling 

assembly. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, and wherein said cooling 
assembly (52) comprises a thermoelectric cooling assembly. 
Apparatus according to either of the preceding claims and also 
including a cover (12, 33) for protecting said needle. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, and also 
including an automatically operating drive (72) for automatically displacing 

said needle. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said automatic 
operating drive comprises: 


a motor (73); and 
a drive train (74), associated with said needle, for driving a 
hypodermic syringe (61) onto which the needle is mounted, along a shaft, and 

for depressing a piston (63) of said hypodermic syringe, thereby to inject a 
liquid contained in said hypodermic syringe. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1-4, and wherein said skin  
 

piercing needle (37) comprises a skin pricking needle. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1-5, and wherein said skin 
piercing needle (37) comprises a hypodermic needle. 
Apparatus according to any of the previous claims, and also 
comprising a flexible cover (120) for the needle, which cover is operative for 

centering said needle along a predetermined axis. 
Apparatus according to any of the previous claims, and also 
comprising: 


a housing for said needle and for said cooling assembly; 
a shaft mounted in a predetermined orientation in said housing;
 
and 
means for decouplably attaching a hypodermic syringe to said 
shaft such that said hypodermic syringe has a predetermined orientation 

relative to said shaft.
