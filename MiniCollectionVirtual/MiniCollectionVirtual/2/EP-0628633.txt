<DESCRIPTION>
The herpesviruses include the herpes simplex
viruses, comprising two closely related variants designated
types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). These types cross
react strongly but can be distinguished by neutralization
titrations. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are responsible for a variety
of human diseases, such as skin infections, genital
herpes, viral encephalitis and the like.The herpes simplex virus is a double stranded
DNA virus having a genome of about 150 to 160kbp packaged
within an icosahedral nucleocapsid enveloped in a
membrane. The membrane includes a number of virus-specific
glycoproteins, the most abundant of which are
gB, gC, gD and gE, where gB and gD are cross-reactive
between types 1 and 2.It is a matter of great medical and scientific
interest to provide safe and effective vaccines against
both HSV-1 and HSV-2. One promising approach has been
the use of isolated glycoproteins which have been shown
to provide protection when injected into mice subsequently
challenged with live virus. However, the availability
of the Herpes Simplex glycoproteins has heretofore
been primarily dependent upon the growth of the virus
and the isolation of the membranous proteins. The problems
of commercial production of the glycoproteins associated
with the handling of a dangerous pathogen, the
maintenance of the virus in cell culture, the isolation
of the glycoproteins free of the viral genome or portions
thereof, have substantially precluded the use of the
glycoproteins as vaccines. It would therefore be desirable
to provide vaccines employing glycoproteins produced 
by methods other than by growth of the virus and
isolation of the membranous proteins.Eberle and Mou, J. of Infectious Diseases
(1983) 148:436-444 report the relative titers of antibodies
to individual polypeptide antigens of HSV-1 in
human sera. Marsden etal., J. of Virology (1978)
28:624-642 report the location of a gene for a 117 kilo-dalton
(kd) glycoprotein to lie within 0.35-0.40 map
units on the genetic map of HSV by intertypic recombination
between HSV-1 and HSV-2. Ruyechan etal., ibid.
(1979) 29:677-697 also report the mapping of glycoprotein
B gene to lie between 0.30-0.42 map units. Skare
and Summers, Virology (1977) 76:581-595, report endonuclease
cleavage sites for EcoRI, XbaI and HindIII on
HSV-1 DNA. Roizman, Ann. Rev. Genetics (1979) 13:25-57
reports the organization of the HSV genomes. DeLucca
etal., Virology (1982) 122:411 map several phenotypic
mutants thought to lie in the gB1 structural gene between
0.345 to 0.368 map units.Subunit vaccines
