<ABSTRACT>
A DMOS transistor having a trenched gate is formed in 
a substrate such that the P body region of the transistor 

may be formed heavier or deeper while still maintaining a 
"short" channel. This is accomplished by forming a 

portion of the N+ type source region within the P body 
region prior to forming the trench, followed by a second 

implantation and diffusion of a relatively shallow 
extension of the N+ source region formed overlying a part 

of the P body region. The increased depth or doping 
concentration of the P body region advantageously lowers 

the resistance of the P body region, while the short 
channel lowers the on-resistance of the transistor for 

improved performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rugged DMOS trenched
transistor with improved resistance characteristics. More
specifically, the invention relates the formation of a
"short" channel and increased doping levels to reduce the
resistance of the body and on-resistance of the transistor
for improved performance.DMOS (double diffused metal oxide semiconductor)
transistors are well known in the art as a type of field
effect transistor (FET) where the channel length is
determined by the higher rate of diffusion of the P body
region dopant (typically boron) compared to the N+ source
region dopant (typically arsenic or phosphorous). The
channel as defined by the body region overlies a lightly
doped drift region. DMOS transistors can have very
"short" channels and typically do not depend on a
lithographic mask to determine channel length. Such DMOS
transistors have good punch-through control because of the
heavily doped P body shield. The lightly doped drift
region minimizes the voltage drop across the channel
region by maintaining a uniform field to achieve a
velocity saturation. The field near the drain region is
the same as in the drift region so that avalanche
breakdown, multiplication and oxide charging are lessened,
compared to conventional MOSFETs. In one type of such DMOS transistor a "trench"
(groove) is used to form the gate structure. These
transistors are typically formed on <100> oriented silicon
substrates (wafers), using an anisotropic etch to form the
trench having sidewalls sloping from the substrate at
54.7°. The doping distribution is the same as in the
above described DMOS transistor. The two channels are
located one on each side of the etched groove. The device
has a common drain contact at the bottom portion of the
substrate. Because many devices can be connected in
parallel, these transistors can handle high current and
high power so are suitable for power switching
applications. It is also well known to form such a
trenched DMOS device with vertical trench sidewalls formed
by isotropic etching, so the trench is rectangular or "U"
shaped in cross section.Often the trench is completely filled with
polysilicon doped to make it conductive and hence serves
as the gate electrode. This also results in the desired
planar structure, i.e. having a nearly flat top surface.A typical prior art trenched DMOS transistor shown in
Figure 14 includes a substrate 62 doped N+, an epitaxial
layer 61 formed thereon doped N-, a body region 63 doped
P, and a source region .65 doped N+. The gate electrode 69

A method of forming a field effect transistor from a
substrate (1,2) of a first conductivity type comprising the

steps of:

forming a body region (3) of a second conductivity type
extending into the substrate (1,2) from a principal surface

of the substrate;
forming a source region (5) of a first conductivity type
extending into the substrate (1,2) from the principal surface

of the substrate and being of a higher doping concentration
than the substrate, the source region laterally defined by a

mask (4) and shallower than the body region (3) with respect
to the principal surface;
forming at least one trench (6) in the substrate (1,2),
the trench being laterally defined by the mask (4) and

extending from the principal surface through the body region
(3) and into a portion of the substrate below the body region;
after the step of forming the trench (6), reforming the
source region (5) by forming an extended portion (8) of the

source region laterally along the principal surface of the
substrate (1,2) on either side of the trench, the reformed

source region (8) being shallower than the body region (3)
with respect to the principal surface, and

   wherein the extended portion (8) of the source region (5)
is shallower with respect to the principal surface than a

portion of the source region (5) immediately adjacent to the
trench (6), and the step of forming the extended portion of

the source region causes diffusion retardation of impurities
in the body region (3) thereby shortening a channel length of

the transistor. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a portion of the
body region (3) immediately adjacent to the trench (6) has

a lower edge which is sloped such that a portion of the lower
edge immediately adjacent the trench is shallower with respect

to the principal surface than is another lower edge portion
of the body region away from the trench.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, further comprising
the step of forming a deep body region (7) of second

conductivity type extending from a principal surface of the
substrate (1,2) and being of a higher doping concentration

than the body region (3), the deep body region being disposed
away from the trench (6) and substantially within the body

region.
