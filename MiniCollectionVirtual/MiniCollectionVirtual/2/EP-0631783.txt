<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antiviral agents, more 
particularly, to pharmaceutical compositions which 
comprises as active ingredients two or more different kinds 
of antiviral substances capable of exerting synergistic 
effect in combination. Infections with human acquired immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), a kind of retrovirus, have become one of 
gravest social problems in recent years. However, there 
are only three antiviral agents clinically available in the 
treatment of HIV infections at present. They all belong to 
nucleoside compounds, that is, 3'-azide-3'-deoxythymidine 
(AZT, Zidovudine), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI, Didanosine) 
and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC, Zalcitabine). Although these existing nucleoside compounds can 
inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase, often through the 
inhibition of their triphosphorylation, and are potent 
antiviral agents, they have problems of various side 
effects and are highly toxic. For example, it has been 
reported that AZT may cause severe anemia or leukopenia due 
to suppression of bone marrow and ddI may cause peripheral 
nervus disorders or acute pancreatitis.  Further, a long-term treatment with these 
nucleoside derivatives can result in the appearance of 
drug-resistant mutant, which is a serious problem among 
practitioners. Lately, there have been developed compounds that 
inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase through a novel 
mechanism, which are called "allosteric inhibitors" because 
they exert their effect by binding to "allosteric 
positions", i.e., those other than the substrate-binding-site, 
of the enzyme (European Patent Publication Nos. 
384522, 429987, 462800, and 420763). These compounds are 
potent HIV inhibitors with less cytotoxicity compared to 
nucleoside compounds. As the HIV infection is becoming more and more 
serious, it is strongly demanded to develop effective and 
low-toxic antiviral agents. The present inventors have studied extensively 
with a purpose of providing antiviral agents which are 
useful in the treatment of HIV infections without serious 
side-effects. In the course of study, a combined use of 
two or more antiviral substances having distinct reaction 
mechanism interested the inventors as a possible approach 
to establish the purpose. Thus, they thought that if a 
combination composed of antiviral substances which are  
 
synergistic is provided, it must be greatly advantageous in 
various respects such as potent antiviral activity, low 
toxicity, reduction of dose and prevention of appearance of 
drug-resistant strains.
