<ABSTRACT>
The present invention proposes a simplified safety 
device for stopping the rotating parts (4) of a road 

maintenance equipment fitted to an utility vehicle 
(1), including an emergency device (13) aimed at 

disengaging a secondary clutch (21) and an electromagnetic 
lamellar brake inserted in a transmission 

group (3) of the equipment (2). A further embodiment 
uses an electromagnetic lamellar brake-clutch as-sembly 

for stopping the rotating parts (4), wholly 
contained in the transmission group (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safety device
mounted to operate in an equipment, provided with
rotating parts, of a road maintenance utility vehicle.The safety device is designed to forcibly stop such
rotating parts in a simple and efficient way, any
time it is requested by safety conditions.There are known road maintenance utility vehicles
equipped with rotating parts, also very powerful,
usually connected to the power take-off of the same
utility vehicles.Different safety devices can be provided for reducing
the danger caused by such rotating parts.One of these devices, commonly used, is constituted
by a barrier placed in front of the equipment and
kept in a raised position so as not to disturb the
machine effectiveness when it is working.The barrier can be lowered, when necessary, by
special means automatically controlled by devices
sensitive to operator's abandonment of the seat or
to opening of one of the vehicle doors.The same operation can be performed manually by an
operator, e.g. by operating a rapid intervention
switch, suitably situated.The same devices control the back off of the rotating
parts from the power take-off, provoking their 
inertial stopping.Both the manual control device and the automatic
control device can be present in the same utility
vehicle at the same time.One of the biggest drawbacks of the safety device
with frontal barrier results from the fact that the
time necessary to stop the rotating parts can be
rather long, since it depends on the weight of the
rotating parts and on the friction opposing the
rotation.Another known safety device is constituted by a disc
brake that can be activated, manually or automatically,
by devices similar to the ones of the safety
device previously described (see, e.g. EP-A-0 295 544).Such disc brake, is placed on the vehicle, coaxially
to the means that transmit the motion to the power
take-off and that are activated by an ancillary
engine, generally situated in the rear part of the
utility vehicle.The brake activation causes a forced stopping of the
rotating parts that is much quicker than the inertial
stopping.A drawback of this type of safety device results
from the fact that it can be used only with specially
constructed vehicles, provided with an ancillary
engine-transmission shaft system, or anyway, arranged
in this way.On the other hand, the positioning of the disc brake
on the equipment is not possible because of the 
dimension of the same disc brake, usually so big as
to provoke a considerable increase of the same
equipment
