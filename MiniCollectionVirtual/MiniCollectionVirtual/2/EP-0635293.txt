<ABSTRACT>
In a non-agitated, countercurrent flow type liquid-liquid 
contacting tower (10), trays (1) consisting of 

column plates (2) and dams (3) are installed horizontally 
inside the tower shell alternately in vertical direction 

with a suitable interval. The column plate (2) share a 
part of the cross-section of the tower to provide a flow 

channel or channels (4) for the liquids, and the dam (3) 
extends from the end of the column plate (2) vertically 

downward and has openings near the column plate. The 
liquid-liquid contactor has high contacting efficiency, 

and thus relatively small sized apparatus can have a 
large treatment capacity. Because the apparatus has no 

moving element, maintenance is easy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a liquid-liquid
contactor, particularly, improvements in liquid-liquid
contactor in which two mutually insoluble liquids are
continuously contacted in countercurrent flow due to the
density difference between the two liquids. Typical use of
the liquid-liquid contactor is liquid-liquid extraction and
liquid-liquid reaction, which are important unit operations
in the petroleum refinery, petrochemistry, coal chemistry,
nuclear energy processing, and many other process industries.Countercurrent flow type liquid-liquid contactors are
divided into two types: one is non-agitated type such as
perforated plate towers, packed towers, and baffle towers;
and the other is mechanically agitated or pulsed type, such
as rotary disk towers, Oldshue-Rushton towers, pulsed towers
and reciprocal extraction towers.Contactors of the latter type exhibit high contacting
efficiency per unit height of the apparatus. The contactors
of this type, however, have drawbacks that equipment
investment is high and maintenance is troublesome, because
they have mechanically driven parts. On the other hand,
contactors of the non-agitated type are advantageous, though 
the contacting efficiency thereof is relatively low, because
of lower investment and easy maintenance.The inventors have continued research for improvements
in the former type, non-agitated liquid-liquid contactors
which can be installed with lower investment and operated
with easy maintenance, particularly, in perforated plate
towers having relatively high contacting efficiency.Conventional perforated plate towers have the
structure, as shown in Figs.11 and 12 (the Figures illustrate
an embodiment in which light liquid "L" is the dispersed
phase and heavy liquid "H" is the continuous phase), that a
heavy liquid inlet (21) and a light liquid outlet (22) are
provided at the top of a tower (20), that a light liquid
inlet (23) and heavy liquid outlet (24) are provided at the
bottom of the tower, and that plural trays (25) are
distributed in the tower.The tray (25) consists of a horizontal perforated
plate (26) which is prepared by cutting off a part of a round
perforated plate to provide a flow channel for liquid stream,
and a vertical plate (27) which extends vertically downward
(dispersed phase feeding direction) from the free end of the
horizontal perforated plate. The flow channel formed by
cutting off of the perforated plate and the vertical plate is
the spout for overflow (the illustrated spout is called a
"downcomer") or a channel for

<CLAIMS>
A liquid-liquid contactor having plural trays wherein
a heavy liquid is fed from the top of a contactor and a light

liquid is fed from the bottom of the contactor so as to
continuously contact both the liquids, one of the two liquids

forming a dispersed phase and the other forming a continuous
phase in countercurrent flow in the contactor; characterized in

that the contactor comprises a tower shell and trays consisting
of column plates and dams, the column plates are unperforated and

extend in
horizontal direction in the tower to cover a part of the cross

section of the tower so as to form flow channels for the
continuous and dispersed phases, the dams extending vertically

from the free ends of the column plates opposite to the direction of
flow of the dispersed phase and wherein openings are provided in the

dams to
allow the dispersed phase flow therethrough so that droplets of

the dispersed phase from an upstream column plate
may form a coalesced layer of the dispersed phase at a downstream

column plate and
that the coalesced layer may flow out in horizontal direction

through the openings in the dams of that downstream column plate.
A liquid-liquid contactor of claim 1, wherein the
plural trays have the same shape and are distributed in the

tower in the positions of alternate 180Â° rotation, and wherein
the continuous phase liquid and the dispersed phase liquid

flowing through the openings make zigzag lines from one side to
the other side of the tower wall alternately. 
A liquid-liquid contactor of claim 1, wherein the
trays consist of the first trays providing liquid flow channels

at both the side thereof and the second trays providing a
liquid channel at one side thereof, and wherein the first and

the second trays are distributed alternately in the tower in
such relative positions that the liquid flow channels do not

exist at the same position along the vertical axis.
A liquid-liquid contactor of claim 1, wherein the
trays consist of the first trays providing two or more liquid

flow channels and the second trays providing at least one liquid
channel, and wherein the first and the second trays are

distributed alternately in the tower in such relative positions
that the liquid flow channels do not exist at the same position

along the vertical axis.
