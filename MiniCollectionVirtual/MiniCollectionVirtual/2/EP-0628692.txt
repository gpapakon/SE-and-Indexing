<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to use a bearing element of an upper pivot bearing for an at least pivotable or for a pivotable and tiltable sash/leaf of a window, of a door or the like, for right-hand attachment and for left-hand attachment of the sash/leaf, the rebate band (3) thereof is mounted, such that it can pivot about a geometrical axis (4), on the vertical retaining arm (5) of the bearing element and, with respect to the latter, can assume two operating positions which are offset through 180@. These are secured, according to the invention, with the aid of a latching device which comprises in each case one through-passage (16 or 17) and a latching member (18) which is retained, such that it can be deflected resiliently, on the vertical retaining arm (5), but, in particular, on the pivot pin (7).

A mounting element of an upper rotary mounting comprising an

arm (12) which extends transversely with respect to the geometrical
mounting axis (11) and which can be associated with an upper transverse

frame member of a movable leaf of a window, a door or the like, which
movable leaf is mounted at least rotatably on a fixed frame, and at

least one mounting sleeve (1, 2) for rotatably mounting the movable
leaf of the window, door or the like, wherein the at least one mounting

sleeve (1, 2) is disposed on a rabbet strip (3) which is mounted
rotatably about a horizontal axis (4) on a holding arm (5) which is

vertical in the assembled position and which is connected to the arm
(12), which rabbet strip (3) can be selectively arrested in one of two

rotational positions which are displaced through 180Â°, wherein arranged
on the rabbet strip (3) at respectively equal spacings from the axis of

rotation (4) thereof are two retaining recesses, openings (16, 17) or
the like receiving means for a latching member (18) arranged on the

holding arm (5) and the latching member (18), in the selected
rotational limit position of the rabbet strip (3), engages

resiliently into the associated opening (16, 17) or the like, wherein
the latching member (18) is formed on a free end of a resiliently

bendable arm (21) arranged separately on the holding arm (5),
characterised in that an end of the bendable arm (21), which end is

remote from the latching member, is held by means of the rotary axis
(7) of the rabbet strip (3).
A mounting element according to claim 1 characterised in that
the end of the resiliently bendable arm (21), which is remote from the

latching member (18), is held to the vertical holding arm (5).
A mounting element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the resiliently bendable arm (21) is arranged

substantially between the rabbet strip (3) and the holding arm (5). 
A mounting element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that a projection portion (22) of the bendable arm

(21), which projects in opposite relationship to the latching member
(18), engages into a receiving means (23), in particular an opening, of

the vertical holding arm (5) and together therewith forms a rotation-preventing
means for the bendable arm (21).
A mounting element according to claim 4 characterised in that
the latching member (18) is formed by the free end of the projection

portion (22) of the bendable arm (21).
A mounting element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the arm (12) which can be associated with the

upper transverse frame member of the movable leaf of the window, door
or the like is a scissor arm of an extension scissor arrangement of a

rotatably and tiltably mounted movable leaf member.
A mounting element according to claim 6 characterised in that
the scissor arm is of a two-part construction as viewed in the

longitudinal direction, wherein the longer scissor part (13) is mounted
rotatably about an axis (14) parallel to the upper transverse frame

member on the shorter scissor arm part which forms the guide arm (8)
and which is disposed at the upper end of the assembled vertical

holding arm (5).
A mounting element according to claim 7 characterised in that
the guide arm (8) is pivotably connected to the vertical holding arm

(5), the geometrical pivot axis (25) extending perpendicularly to the
plane of the frame.
A mounting element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the resiliently bendable arm (21) is fitted into

an opening provided in the surface of the holding arm (5), which is
remote from the mounting sleeve (1, 2).
