<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of gel
electrophoresis. More particularly. this invention
relates to apparatus for effecting electrophoresis
across a gel and to a transfer membrane, so that the
electrophoretically driven molecular components are
accurately separated on the membrane, and processes
using the apparatus herein.Gel electophoresis is an important tool in
analytical and clinical laboratories. It takes
advantage of the electrokinetic differences of ions in
an electric field to accomplish separation of complex
mixtures so that the components can be identified or
isolated. A gel, such as agarose or polyacrylamide, is
cast in a mold to produce, most commonly, an extended
block of rectangular cross-section which is relatively
thin. Wells are formed at one end. The block is
supported and immersed in a buffer solution in apparatus
having an electrode at each end. The wells are loaded
with a solution containing the material under study,
such as nucleic acids, and the gel is subjected to an
electric field providing a high gradient along the
length. The molecules migrate toward the distant
electrode at different rates dependent on their
mobility, which is a function of size and charge
density. There are many variations of this methodology:
the gels may have density gradients, either continuous
or in steps; the voltage or temperature may be
controlled or varied, as by controlled polarity reversal 
for example; and gradients may be established in pH or
in concentration.Regardless of the particular scheme employed, two
basic modes of operation are used. In the usual mode,
the separation is run for a finite time and then the
separated molecules are read in place by some known
technique which renders the pattern readable such as
staining or marking with a radioactive or fluorescent
material. Alternatively, the pattern is transferred in
the orthogonal direction by one of various known
techniques such as Southern blotting, pressure blotting,
vacuum blotting, or electroblotting (transverse electric
field) or the like. The separated molecules are
immobilized on blotting paper or more usually, a
membrane of nylon or the like where they can be
identified by any of such procedures as selective
dyeing, radioactive marking, fluorescence, and
chemiluminescence. The procedure may employ a suitable
probe to attach the marking means to the separated
species.In the other mode, often used in preparatory
electrophoresis, the gel separation is run continuously
(or for an extended time) and the separated species are
allowe
