<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a toothed gear as used in particular in drives to pivoting devices such as are used in articulated-arm awnings or windows. One shaft (5) rests, via a zone (10), against the other shaft (3), thus ensuring that the toothed gear proposed is extremely compact and stable to knocks and blows.

<CLAIMS>
Toothed gear having a single item part or 
multi-part first shaft (3), carrying a first gear wheel 

(4), and a single item part or multi-part second shaft 
(5), arranged at an angle thereto and carrying at least 

one second gear wheel (6), which shafts (3,5) are 
mounted in a bearing block (7), at least the first 

shaft passing twice through the bearing block (7) and 
having a support zone (10) which supports the second 

shaft (5), characterised in that the support zone (10) 
directly supports the second shaft (5) passing only 

once through the bearing block (7) and itself serves as 
an axial pivot bearing for it and at the same time is 

formed along the axis of the first shaft (3) in such a 
way that it fills the space between the first gear 

wheel (4) and the bearing block (7) to such an extent 
that the first shaft (3) can still be easily rotated 

but is capable of resisting warping caused by tensile 
or compressive forces. 
Toothed gear according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the shaft (3) passing through 

twice corresponds to a drive shaft and the supported 
second shaft (5) is formed by an output shaft, the 

support zone (10) being arranged between the driving 
gear wheel (4) and the bearing of the driving shaft (3) 

in the bearing block (7) and optionally having an 
increased diameter (D) measured at the drive shaft (3) 

outside the bearing block (7). 
Toothed gear according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the support zone (10) is 

supported on the one hand in the region of a bearing 
for the continuous shaft (3) on the bearing block (7) 

and on the other hand on the gear wheel (4) borne by 
the shaft (3) passing through twice, and at the same 

time supports the gear wheel (6) borne by the supported 
second shaft (5). 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing block (7) is 

U-shaped or pan-shaped and has at least two limbs  
 

(7a,b) opposite one another, on which the shaft (3) 
passing through twice is mounted, the supported second 

shaft (5) being mounted on the connecting limb (7c), 
and optionally a cover (7d) or yoke which has a 

frictional and/or interlocking connection being 
provided for closing the U or the pan. 
Toothed gear according the any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the shaft (3) passing 

through twice is rotatably mounted at least on one side 
of the bearing block (7) in a mounting tube (2) which 

is connected to the bearing block (7), for example 
screwed on to, screwed in to, pressed together with, 

welded with or formed as a single piece with said 
bearing block. 
Toothed gear wheel according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the support 

zone (10) is formed by an optionally rotatable and/or 
2-part sleeve or socket (8) which surrounds the shaft 

(3) passing through twice and is supported on both 
sides, preferably at least the lateral surface of the 

sleeve (8) optionally also the other parts rubbing 
against one another being provided with coating to 

impart sliding properties - in particular by means of 
Teflon (registered trademark of DUPONT). 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the drive shaft (3) is in 

one piece and that the driving gear wheel(4) is fixed 
axially and detachably to this shaft, said shaft 

preferably having, on the side of the mounting tube (2) 
at least one socket ring (9), which likewise acts 

axially and can be detachably fixed, for connecting the 
shaft (3) to at least one shaft extension (3a,b). 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the driving gear wheel 

(4) and/or the sleeve (8) is in the form of a coupling 
socket, or are each in the form of a coupling socket, 

and that the drive shaft (3) consists of at least two 
parts which can be connected to one another by at least 

one of the coupling sockets.  
 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the driving gear wheel 

(4) is formed as a single piece together with the 
sleeve (8). 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the driving gear wheel 

(4) is fixed on the drive shaft (3) in such a way that 
a concentric coupling zone projects into the interior 

of the bearing block (7) and/or that the sleeve (8) 
serves a coupling socket for the drive shaft consisting 

of two parts. 
Toothed gear according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that three intermeshing gear 

wheels which form a differential are provided. 
Use of a toothed gear according to any of the 
preceding claims for an opening drive of articulated-arm 

awnings, windows, doors, flaps, adjusting 
mechanisms for gear or motor controls, etc.
