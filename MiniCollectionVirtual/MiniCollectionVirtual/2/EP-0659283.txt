<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an integrated opto-acoustic component to shift light frequencies, in which two separated light guides (11, 12) have an optical coupling region (13) formed in the manner of a directive coupler in which the two light guides (11, 12) are at a short distance from each other to generate an optical coupling. The acoustic waves (19) from a sound generator extend longitudinally over the coupling region (13). The two light guides (11, 12) have different diffusion constants for light. If, for example, light in mode (a) is radiated into light guide (11) and if the sound generator (14) is switched on, the photons of mode (a) are scattered on the photons of the sound waves and converted into mode (b) of light guide (12), where they can diffuse. This produces a frequency shift. The opto-acoustic component thus contains a frequency shifter and also a coupler which can be used as a beam divider and/or optical switch.

Integrated acoustooptical component for 
frequency-shifting optical frequencies, having two 

separately guided optical waveguides (11, 12) which 
exhibit differing propagation constants 
β
a
 and 
β
b

light, and which exhibit an optical coupling region (13), 

which is designed in the manner of a directional coupler 
and in which the two optical waveguides (11, 12) exhibit 

a small spacing from one another generating an optical 
coupling, and having a sound generator (14) which acts 

with acoustic waves (19) on the two optical waveguides 
(11,12) in the coupling region (13), in the longitudinal 

direction of the two waveguides (11,12), characterised in 
that limiters (21, 22) preventing the lateral propagation 

of the acoustic waves (19) are disposed on both sides of 
the coupling region (13), which limiters form an acoustic 

waveguide. 
Component according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the difference of the propagation constants 
β
a
 and 

β
b
 of the optical waveguides (11, 12) corresponds to the 
propagation constant 
K
 of the acoustic wave (19): 

β

β
b

Component according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that to generate the difference of the propagation 

constants of the optical waveguides (11, 12) 
differing dimensionings of the same and/or differing 

materials of the same and/or differing modes of the 
guidance of the optical waves are provided. 
Component according to Claim 3, characterised in  
 

that differing widths and/or heights of the optical 
waveguides (11, 12) are provided for the differing 

dimensioning. 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the sound generator (14) is 

designed to generate acoustic surface waves. 
Component according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the sound generator (14) is designed as an interdigital 

electroacoustic transducer. 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the sound generator (14) is 

disposed in extension of the coupling region (13) between 
the two waveguides (11, 12). 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the sound generator (14) 

and the coupling region (13) are bounded in the longitudinal 
direction on at least one side by a sound 

absorber (20, 20'). 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by use as an optical switch. 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by simultaneous use as a frequency 

shifter and as a beam splitter. 
Component according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by use as a variable beam splitter 

by variation of the acoustic frequency.
