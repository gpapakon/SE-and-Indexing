<ABSTRACT>
An automated storage library (31) having the ability to store and 
manipulate data storage elements in three dimensions. Data storage 

elements such as tape cartridges (40) are stored in storage compartments 
separated by low-friction downward sloping sliding planes each capable of 

holding a plurality of data storage elements. The automated storage 
library further includes a magnetic picker apparatus having two 

electromagnetic coils (52, 450). In one embodiment, the two coils are 
energized simultaneously with the first coil (450) used to reposition an 

L-shaped flipper (460). This flipper raises a roller gate (38) positioned 
at one end of a storage compartment to release a stored data storage 

element. The second electromagnetic coil (52) supplements the 
gravitational pull on the data storage element by attracting a steel 

strip (440) on the face of the data storage element and an associated 
coil carriage retrieves the data storage element from the compartment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automated storage libraries. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a magnetic picker mechanism for a 
gravity feed storage library. Many business and technical applications require very large 
databases for storing information used in connection with the 
applications. Database storage requirements can exceed hundreds or 
thousands of gigabytes of data. Often these storage requirements can not 
be met by disk drive storage due to cost and/or physical space 
limitations. Data storage for such large databases are typically stored 
on magnetic tape which provides the lowest storage cost per unit of data. Tape storage, however, generally requires the longest access time 
among existing technologies for retrieving the stored data. There are two 
primary reasons for this. First, once a tape is loaded into a tape drive, 
accessing the data stored on the tape is substantially slower than 
accessing data stored on devices such as a direct access storage device 
(DASD) or an optical disk. This is primarily due to the respective 
transport speeds of the data containing medium as well as the bandwidth 
attainable by the read heads present in the respective storage devices. 
Moreover, since tape is accessed sequentially, a substantial delay can 
occur prior to locating the required tape segment. Secondly, the time 
required to locate the desired tape and transport it to the tape drive 
for loading can bring about substantial delays. Early magnetic tape databases required an operator, when prompted, 
to retrieve a tape from a shelf and load the tape into a tape drive. This 
procedure was not only time consuming but was also prone to human 
operator errors. Automated storage libraries such as that disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 5,015,139 have been developed to overcome the delays 
associated with loading and unloading tapes. In addition, automated 
storage libraries eliminate the above described human operator errors 
associated with handling the tapes. It is now possible, through the use of automated storage libraries, 
to automatically retrieve a data storage element (e.g. a tape cassette) 
from a storage location, transport it to a drive unit associated with the 
computer system and insert it therein. In this manner, human operator  
 
error can be avoided and request to load time can be significantly 
decreased. The ability to place larger amounts of data on tape has derived 
principally from two technological advancements. First, actual cartridge 
size has been diminished as a result
