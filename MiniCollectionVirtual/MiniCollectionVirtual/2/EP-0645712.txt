<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor storage
circuit, and more particularly to a semiconductor storage
circuit having memory cells formed from non-volatile
transistors.In order to achieve high efficiency in productivity
of semiconductor storage circuits (semiconductor memories),
it is crucial to enhance the yield in production
of chips. However, as semiconductor memories continue to
increase in capacity as a result of the advance of a
fine working techniques in recent years, pattern defects
caused by dust or similar foreign matter have also
progressively increased, with the result that many chips
are selectively determined to be unacceptable because
several defective memory cells are produced in a memory
cell block, or a row line or a column line is disconnected
or short-circuited by a pattern defect. Therefore,
potential for increased productivity by enhancement
of the yield in production of chips is approaching
its limit. Here, a redundancy relief method is commonly
employed as a means of changing unacceptable chips to
acceptable articles. According to this method, spare 
memory cells and a redundancy control circuit are provided
in a chip so that defective memory cells may be
replaced with the spare memory cells.The redundancy relief method is a method wherein,
for example, spare memory cells for column lines, spare
memory cells for row lines, fuse circuits for column
line redundancy switching information, fuse circuits for
row line redundancy switching information and a redundancy
switching control circuit are provided, and redundancy
switching information is stored in advance in the
fuse circuits. Defective memory cells are replaced with
the column line spare memory cells or the row line spare
memory cells in accordance with the redundancy switching
information.In a volatile memory integrated circuit such as a
DRAM or an SRAM, polycrystalline silicon is normally
used for fuse elements constituting a fuse circuit. In
this instance, an inspection step of chips is time
consuming because a step of fusing polycrystalline
silicon using a laser or some other suitable means to
store redundancy switching information is required
before the fuse element is enclosed into a package.
In contrast, in an EPROM or a flash memory which is a
non-volatile memory integrated circuit, memory cells are
constituted from electrically writable non-volatile
transistors. In addition, a fuse circuit can be constructed
using a fuse element constituted from a non-volatile 
transistor. Because redundancy switching
