<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a method for high-power acoustic wave emission and corresponding transducer horns. The technical sector of the invention is that of producing immersed electroacoustic transducers. A transducer horn according to the invention, including at least one driving pillar (column) (1), of cylindrical shape, one end of which is solidly fastened to the said horn (3), is composed of a central core (15), made of rigid material, providing coupling to the end of the said pillar (1), and of an external ring (16) surrounding the said core (15) and made of a material lighter than that of the latter.

A method for emitting high power acoustic waves starting from a transducer 
comprising at least one cylindrical driving assembly, and at least one 

headmasse having the same dimensions and external volume determined for 
transmitting waves in a frequency range and at a given power, and dependent 

on one end of said assembly, characterised in that : 

the coupling between the said assembly and said headmasse is ensured by a 
core made of a rigid material, located in the headmasse centre ; 
the external ring of the headmasse surrounding said core is made of a 
material lighter than the latter, and completing said determined volume ; 
the transducer emitting power is increased for the same given 
frequency range. 
A method of emission according to claim 1, wherein : 


the assembly is embedded in said core , 
the same external volume of the transducer is kept by increasing the length of 
said assembly . 
A method for emitting according to claim 1, characterised in that said 
headmasse is built with a ring made from aluminium or another aluminium 

alloy, representing between 65 and 85 % of the total volume of the 
headmasse, and a core made of steel or steel alloy, filling the remaining 

volume of the headmasse. 
A headmasse of transducers emitting acoustic waves comprising at least 
one cylindrical driving assembly, an extremity of which is dependent on said 

headmasse, characterised in that it comprises a central core, made of rigid 
material, ensuring the coupling with the end of said assembly, and an external 

ring surrounding said core and made from a material lighter 
than the latter. 
A transducer headmasse according to claim 4, wherein the end of said 
assembly is embedded in the said core. 
A transducer headmasse according to claim 4, wherein said ring is made of 
aluminium or an aluminum alloy material for 65 to 85 % of the total volume of 

the headmasse, and said core is made of steel or steel alloy filling the 
remaining volume of the headmasse. 
A transducer headmasse according to claim 4, wherein said core is 
cylindrical, and has the same axis as the assembly.  

 
A transducer headmasse according to claim 4, wherein said core is 
truncated, and has the same axis as the assembly. 
A headmasse transducer according to claim 4, wherein part of the external 
surface of said core is in direct contact with the ambient medium. 
A headmasse transducer according to claim 6, wherein the volume of 
aluminum or aluminum alloy making up said ring is 75 to 85 % of the total 

volume of the headmasse.
