<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new 4-aryl-3-(heteroarylureido)-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-quinoline
derivatives,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, novel
3-(p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino) quinoline intermediates
used in the synthesis of such compounds and the use of such
compounds to inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol,
lower serum cholesterol and reverse the development of
atherosclerosis. The compounds are inhibitors of acyl
coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT).Cholesterol that is consumed in the diet (dietary
cholesterol) is absorbed as free cholesterol by the mucosal
cells of the small intestine. It is then esterified by the
enzyme ACAT, packaged into particles known as chylomicrons,
and released into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are
particles into which dietary cholesterol is packaged and
transported in the bloodstream. By inhibiting the action
of ACAT, the compounds of this invention prevent intestinal
absorption of dietary cholesterol and thus lower serum
cholesterol levels. They are therefore useful in preventing
atherosclerosis, heart attacks and strokes.By inhibiting the action of ACAT, the compounds of the
present invention also enable cholesterol to be removed from
the walls of blood vessels. This activity renders such
compounds useful in slowing or reversing the development of
atherosclerosis as well as in preventing heart attacks and
strokes.Other inhibitors of ACAT are referred to in United
states Patents 4,716,175 and 4,743,605 (a divisional of the
'175 patent), the European Patent Applications having
publication numbers 0 242 610, 0 245 687, 0 252 524,
0 354 994, and 0 418 071. Certain ureas and thioureas as antiatherosclerosis
agents are referred to in United States Patent 4,623,662
and in the European Patent Applications having publication
numbers 0 335 374, 0 386 487, 0 370 740, 0 405 233 and
0 421 456.The present invention relates to compounds of the
formula

wherein each m is independently selected from 0 to 4;
R2 is selected from hydrogen and (C1-C6) alkyl;Each R3 and R4 is independently selected from halogen,
(C1-C6) alkyl optionally substituted with one or more halogen
atoms, (C1-C6) alkoxy optionally substituted with one or more
halogen atoms, (C1-C6) alkylthio optionally substituted with
one or more halogen atoms; nitro, carboxyl optionally
esterified with a (C1-C6) alkyl group; hydroxyl, (C1-C4)
acyloxy and (C1-C3) acyl;X is sulfur or oxygen; andQ is
6-(C1-C3) alkoxyquinolin-5-yl, 6-(C1-C3) alkylthioquinolin-5-yl,
