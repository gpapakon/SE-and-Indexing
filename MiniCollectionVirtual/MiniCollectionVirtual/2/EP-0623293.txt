<DESCRIPTION>
This design patent application concerns a sandal consisting 
of components assembled without the use of special tooling 
or skilled labour which can be sold knocked-down in kits, 
providing the end user with the satisfaction of mounting 
the sandal personally. The sandal according to the invention consists of a moulded 
plastic sole on which a moulded plastic mid-sole is 
attached and press fitted, said mid-sole having projections 
and cuts which couple respectively with the corresponding 
cuts and projections on the underlying sole. The opposing sides of the sole edge having shaped 
projecting flaps with one or more slots for the passage of 
the straps which form the upper consisting of bands which 
hold the foot at the ankle and metatarsal area of the foot. 
Said straps may be made of fabric, leather, synthetic 
fabric or imitation leather or in any other suitable 
material.  Each strap may be fitted with a standard fastener to ensure 
its rapid fastening and unfastening, such as a buckle, 
clips or inserts in self-adhesive material commonly known 
as "rip-off straps", which permit fixing the end section of 
the strap prior to folding it back. A moulded plastic insole is fitted over the mid-sole, the 
surface of said insole being characterized by a close-fitting 
series of non-slip projections while the treading 
surface of the sole being characterized by a non-slip 
engraved tread. In the preferred embodiment of the sandal according to the 
invention, the sandal components (sole, mid-sole, insole 
and upper) are in different colours so as to create an 
attractive multicoloured effect. One of the most important advantages of the sandal 
according to the invention is the possibility it offers of 
meeting the different requirements of customers promptly 
without having to stock large quantities of finished 
products in the complete range of colour combinations in 
the collection. In other words, the footwear shop, by holding an adequate 
stock of the single components in the different colours, 
upon receipt of the order, needs only select the required 
components to assemble according to the customers choice. 
For major clarity the description of the invention 
continues with reference to the tables in the enclosed 
drawings, which are intended for purposes of illustration 
and not in a limiting sense, whereby:  figs. 1 and 2 are a perspective of the sandal according 
to the invention illustrating the straps fastened and 
unfastened respectively; fig. 3 is a perspective of the sandal according to the

<CLAIMS>
A sandal consisting of components assembled without 
the use of special tooling or skilled labour characterized 

by: 

a moulded plastic sole (2) having a series of slots (2a) 
and cuts (2b) for housing conforming and corresponding 

projections (3a and 3b) on the bottom surface of the mid-sole 
(3); said sole (2) being characterized by two opposing 

and identical flaps (2c) which project from the side edges 
of this sole (2), approximately at the level of the ankle-bones; 

said flaps (2c) terminating at the top with an 
enlarged head having two slots, one of which is vertical 

(2d) and the other sub-horizontal (2e). The side edges of 
the insole (2) being characterized by a number of opposing 

and projecting ears at the level of the metatarsal area of 
the foot; two consecutive ears (2f) being on the external 

side and one ear (2g) being on the internal side, all three 
ears having an internal slot (2h); the top surface of the 

sole (2) being characterized by a series of regularly 
spaced truncated-cone elements (2i) along the perimeter 

 
which fit into corresponding dead holes (3i) on the bottom 

surface of the mid-sole (3); the base of the internal face 
of the flaps (2c) and of the ears (2f and 2g) being 

characterized by transverse elements (2m) which fit into 
corresponding transverse slots (3m) along the edge of the 

mid-sole (3); 
a moulded plastic mid-sole (3) which couples precisely 
with the underlying sole (2) thanks to the projections (3a 

and 3b), dead holes (3i) and transverse slots (3m) which 
provide a male and female coupling with conforming and 

corresponding elements on the sole (2); the sides of the 
mid-sole (3) having reduced housings (3c) for housing the 

flaps (2c) of the sole (2) as well as reduced housings (3g 
and 3f) for housing the ears (2g and 2f) of the sole (2), 

respectively; 
an insole (4) fitted above the mid-sole (3) having a 
close-fitting series of non-slip projections. 
a set of three straps (5a, 5b and 6) each having 
fastening and hooking devices: the first (5a) holding the 

ankle, the second (5b) holding the front of the foot, the 
third double strap (6) being folded back to hold the top of 

the foot at the level of the metatarsal area of the foot. 
A sandal consisting of components assembled without 
the use of special tooling or skilled labour according to 

claim 1 characterized in that the fastening and hooking 
means of the straps (5a, 5b and 6) in the preferred 

embodiment of the invention consist of inserts (7) made of 
self-adhesive material.
