<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control device 
for an induction motor, and more particularly to a 
control device for coping with a variation in the load 
by changing the rotation speed according to a variation 
in the torque of the load. The conventional induction motor (see JP-A-59159695) uses a VVVF 
(variable voltage and variable frequency) type voltage 
inverter in which both of the voltage and frequency can 
be varied. When the torque of the load varies, the 
rotation speed is changed. In this case, since the 
magnetic flux in the motor varies in proportion to the 
voltage/frequency ratio, a voltage is lowered to keep 
the ratio V/f of the output voltage V to the frequency f 
at a constant value when the frequency is lowered to 
lower the rotation speed of the motor. The V/f ratio 
represents a frequency-voltage characteristic of the 
motor, the conventional inverter contains a plurality of 
V/f characteristic patterns, and the user selects one of 
the V/f characteristic patterns according to the type of 
the load, motor and the circumstance by trial-and-error. However, it is difficult to determine a V/f pattern 
which is suitable for a system in which the load varies, 
and in practice, an excessively large V/f ratio must be 
selected and it is not satisfactory from the viewpoint 
of energy saving. That is, since the V/f ratio is not 
changed according to a variation in the motor load, the  
 
slippage s of the motor becomes excessively small when 
the load is small, and in contrast, the slippage s 
becomes excessively large when the load is large, 
thereby lowering the motor efficiency. Thus, in the conventional induction motor 
controlling device, since the voltage V is not 
controlled according to the load torque, the slippage is 
deviated from a desired value by a variation in the load 
torque, thereby lowering the efficiency. The present invention has been made in view of the 
above problem, and an object of the present invention is 
to provide an induction motor controlling device and method which 
can keep the motor efficiency constant irrespective of a 
variation in the load and drive the induction motor with 
high efficiency. The above object can be attained by an induction 
motor controlling device comprising: 
means for applying an initial preset primary voltage V1(1) or a primary voltage V1(n) determined during the last cycle 
to an induction motor; means for detecting a primary current I1(n) of the 
induction motor; means for deriving a torque factor parameter u(n) 
expressed by
