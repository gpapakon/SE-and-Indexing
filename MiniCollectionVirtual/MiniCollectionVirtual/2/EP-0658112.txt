<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a substantially water-soluble biologically active conjugate comprising a substantially straight-chained organic polymer having a number of functional groups distributed along the polymer backbone chain, via which groups a number of molecules from the group of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in a non-active part thereof are anchored through covalent bonds. The invention also relates to the production of the conjugate, the preparation of a substrate surface with the conjugate, a substrate surface thus prepared, and the conjugate for use as a therapeutical agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel biologically
active conjugate based upon sulphated glycosaminoglycan, a
process of preparing the conjugate, a substrate whose
surface has been prepared with such a conjugate, and a
process of surface-preparation using the conjugate.Sulphated glycosaminoglycans is the common name of a
number of endogenous sulphated mucopolysaccharides, such as
e.g. heparin, heparan sulphate, dermatan sulphate and
chondroitin sulphate, which exhibit a number of different
biological properties. While the invention relates to
sulphated glycosaminoglycans generally, it will, however,
in the following to a great extent be described with regard
to the glycosaminoglycan that has so far found the greatest
medical use, viz. heparin.Heparin occurs naturally complex-bound to protein in
various mammalian tissues, such as the intestine, liver and
lung, as well as in mast cells, and has then a molecular
weight which may extend up to 100,000, while commercially
available preparations have a molecular weight varying
between about 6,000 and 20,000 depending on the source and
the determination method. It consists of alternating
glucuronic acid and glucosamine units, and the anti-coagulating
effect has been shown to be linked to a
specific pentasaccharide unit of the molecule which has
antithrombin-binding properties.Due to its anti-coagulating properties, heparin, which
is usually prepared from intestinal mucosa from pig, has
found use as an agent for dissolving thromboses, but
perhaps above all for preventing the formation thereof. The
latter is the case for inter alia procedures in, for
example, the treatment of renal disease, open cardiac
surgery and intensive care, which procedures involve
treating the patient's blood in a circulating system
outside the body, so-called extra-corporeal circulation
(e.g. artificial kidneys, heart-lung machines, 
oxygenators), where the blood will get in contact with
various materials foreign to the body.To eliminate the clotting ability of the blood in such
systems, and thereby avoid clogging by blood clots, high
doses of heparin must be added to the blood. Due to the
accompanying substantially increased risk of bleeding,
which in the worst case may lead to life-threatening
conditions, efforts have for a long time past aimed at
trying to instead achieve the desired coagulation
preventing effect by modifying the body-foreign material
with which the blood will get in contact by surface-binding
heparin thereto. Decisive factors which have stimulated
this development
