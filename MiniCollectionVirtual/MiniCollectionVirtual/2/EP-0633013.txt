<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method of stabilizing a bicarbonate-containing 
powdered medicine by employing the means for packing this 

powdered medicine in a water- and gas-permeable plastic container, 
and wrapping this container with a plastic packaging material having 

a water- and gas-non-permeability with a hollow space between the 
container and packaging material filled with carbon dioxide or provided 

therein with a carbon dioxide generating oxygen scavenger or a carbon 
dioxide saturation adsorbed drying agent; and a container for practicing 

this method. According to the present invention, its original object 
of mixing bicarbonate with a powdered material without causing the 

denaturation and deterioration of a bicarbonate-containing powdered 
medicine can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
stabilizing a bicarbonate-containing powdery pharmaceutical
composition, particularly a novel method of
stabilizing a bicarbonate-containing powdery pharmaceutical
composition which allows the composition in a
plastic container to remain wholesome without aging or
degradation and the object of addition of the carbonate
to be accomplished without compromise and to a package
form for such bicarbonate-containing powdery pharmaceutical
composition.With very few exceptions such as sodium
chloride, drugs are susceptible to aging loads such as
water, oxygen and light and glass ampules have been in
use for their storage since many years ago. However,
with the recent advances in pharmaceutical science,
material engineering, production methodology or production
equipment, these pharmaceutical containers are
being replaced by glass vials and plastic (such as 
polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene,
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyethylene
terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride) containers which
are easy for those engaged in medical practice to handle
and easy to dispose of after use and the utilization of
such plastic containers, in particular, is rapidly
spreading of late.However, unlike glass, plastics are inherently
permeable to gas and moisture and have the disadvantage
that containers made thereof cannot be used for all kinds
of drugs. Recently, materials which are almost as
impervious to gas and moisture as glass, such as a
laminate film carrying a vapor-deposited aluminum layer
or an aluminum foil, a laminate film carrying a vapor-deposited
silicon monoxide layer, a multi-layer film
consisting of plural materials such as polyethylene
terephthalate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylidene
chloride, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer have
been developed and today plastics with an oxygen
permeability rate of not more than 1.0 cc/m2·24 hrs/1
atm. and a moisture permeability rate of not more than
1.0 g/m2·24 hrs/1 atm. are available on the market and
finding ever broadening usage and application.Meanwhile, drugs are generally stable in the
bulk form but if they are dissolved and administered to 
patients, the low pH values of the solutions would not
only damage the local tissue at the administration site
but also induce systemic disturbances or result in poor
absorption. Therefore, a variety of pharmaceutical
contrivances has so far been made to avoid the troubles.
By way of illustration, assuming that the pharmaceutical
composition contains a strongly acidic powdery

<CLAIMS>
A method of stabilizing a bicarbonate-containing

powdery pharmaceutical composition
characterized by filling the bicarbonate-containing

powdery pharmaceutical composition in a moisture- and
gas-permeable plastic container, wrapping the so-filled

container in a moisture- and gas-impermeable plastic
wrapper and carrying out at least one procedure selected

from the group consisting of the procedure of introducing
a carbon dioxide gas into a space between said container

and wrapper, the procedure of disposing a carbon dioxide-liberating
deoxygenating agent in said space and the

procedure of disposing a desiccant previously saturated
with a carbon dioxide gas by way of adsorption in said

space.
The method defined in claim 1 wherein the
carbon dioxide gas-liberating deoxygenating agent and

desiccant are disposed together in the space between said
container and wrapper.
The method defined in claim 1 wherein the
bicarbonate-containing powdery pharmaceutical composition

is a powdered dialysate composition.
The method defined in claim 1 or 2 wherein
the bicarbonate-containing powdery pharmaceutical

composition is an antibiotic-containing composition. 
A package form for insuring a stabilized
bicarbonate-containing pharmaceutical composition

characterized in that said package form comprises (1) a
moisture- and gas-permeable plastic container accommodating

the bicarbonate-containing pharmaceutical
composition, (2) a moisture- and gas-impermeable plastic

wrapper covering the container and (3) at least one
species selected from the group consisting of a carbon

dioxide gas, a carbon dioxide-liberating deoxygenating
agent and a desiccant previously saturated with a carbon

dioxide gas by way of adsorption, said species being
disposed in a space between said container and wrapper.
The package form defined in claim 5 wherein
the carbon dioxide gas-liberating deoxygenating agent and

desiccant are disposed together in the space between said
container and wrapper.
