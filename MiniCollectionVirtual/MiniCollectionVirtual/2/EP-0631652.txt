<ABSTRACT>
A valve closing mechanism comprises a stand-off arm (18) adapted for attachment to the valve body, a lever arm (22) incorporating a fitting (24) for connection to the valve spindle (16), and an actuator (26) acting between the stand-off arm (18) and the lever arm (22) for effecting angular oscillatory movement of the lever arm, said fitting comprising a one-way drive transmitting arrangement whereby the spindle is rotated when the lever arm is displaced in one direction but remains stationary when the lever arm is displaced in the opposite direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to valve closing mechanisms for use in closing
spindle-controlled valves of the type used with gas storage vessels.Toxic or hazardous fluids such as chlorine are often stored in cylinders
equipped with a valve which is designed to be turned on and off by means of a
rotatable spindle, rotation of which serves to move a valve member relative to a
valve seat.If there is a leakage of the toxic fluid downstream of the storage vessel, it is
essential that the valve is closed rapidly and reliably without risk to personnel.US-A-4629157 discloses remote control apparatus for opening and closing the
valve of containers or the like. The disclosed apparatus comprises a rotary
bi-directional drive mechanism, a shaft driven by the drive mechanism, and a drive
wheel mounted on the shaft, the drive wheel having at one end teeth which engage
notches formed in the peripheral edge of a valve wheel of the container. When the
drive mechanism is activated, the shaft turns the drive wheel which causes the valve
wheel of the container to turn thereby causing the valve of the container to open or
close.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a valve
closing mechanism comprising a stand-off arm adapted for attachment to the valve
body, a lever arm incorporating a fitting for connection to the valve spindle, and an
actuator acting between the stand-off arm and the lever arm for effecting angular
oscillatory movement of the lever arm, said fitting comprising a one-way drive
transmitting arrangement whereby the spindle is rotated when the lever arm is
displaced in one direction but remains stationary when the lever arm is displaced in
the opposite direction.According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided in combination,
a valve closing mechanism as defined in said one aspect of the invention and a
valve assembly comprising:
a valve body having an outlet;valve means associated with the outlet; anda spindle mounted for rotation relative to the valve body and coupled to the valve
means whereby rotation of the spindle in one sense effects valve closure and
rotation in the opposite sense effects valve opening;the lever arm of said mechanism being connected to the valve spindle via said
one-way drive transmitting arrangement (24).In accordance with a preferred feature of the invention, the standoff arm, the
lever arm and the drive arrangement are embodied in an assembly which can be
assembled and detached from the valve body as 
a unit thereby facilitating rapid changeover

<CLAIMS>
A valve closing mechanism comprising a stand-off arm (18) adapted for
attachment to the valve body, a lever arm (22) incorporating a fitting (24) for

connection to the valve spindle (16), and an actuator (26) acting between the
stand-off arm (18) and the lever arm (22) for effecting angular oscillatory movement

of the lever arm (22), said fitting (24) comprising a one-way drive transmitting
arrangement whereby the spindle (16) is rotated when the lever arm (22) is

displaced in one direction but remains stationary when the lever arm (22) is
displaced in the opposite direction.
In combination, a valve closing mechanism as claimed in Claim 1 and a valve
assembly (12) comprising:


a valve body having an outlet (14);
valve means associated with the outlet (14); and
a spindle (16) mounted for rotation relative to the valve body and coupled to the
valve means whereby rotation of the spindle in one sense effects valve closure and

rotation in the opposite sense effects valve opening;
the lever arm (22) of said mechanism being connected to the valve spindle via said
one-way drive transmitting arrangement (24).
A mechanism or combination as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which the
standoff arm (18), the lever arm (22) and the drive arrangement (24) are embodied

in an assembly which can be assembled and detached from the valve body as a unit.
A mechanism or combination as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 in which
the actuator is in the form of a double acting pneumatic piston and cylinder

assembly (26).
A mechanism or combination as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 in which
the one-way drive transmitting device (24) comprises a pawl and ratchet drive.
A gas supply system comprising at least one gas storage vessel (10) having a
valve-controlled outlet and an associated valve closing mechanism or combination in the form

defined in any one of the preceding claims, means (38, 44) for controlling operation
of the valve closing mechanism or mechanisms, the control means including gas

sensing means (44) responsive to the stored gas and being operable, upon detection
of gas by the sensing means, to initiate operation of the actuator (26) to close the or

each valve.
