<ABSTRACT>
A helmet comprising a main cap body (2) and an 
auxiliary cap body (3) mounted on left and right 

opposite sidewalls of the main cap body (2). The main 
cap body (2) is of "open-face" construction and has a 

large window opening (4). The auxiliary cap body (3) 
is turnable between a lowered position in which it 

covers a lower portion of the large window opening (4), 
and a lifted position in which the entire large window 

opening is exposed. A lock mechanism (39) is provided 
for automatically locking the auxiliary cap body (3) to 

the main cap body (2) in the lowered position of the 
auxiliary cap body (3). Thus, when the auxiliary cap 

body (3) is in the lowered position the locking of the 
auxiliary cap body (3) to the main cap body (2) is 

achieved reliably and easily and the helmet is given 
the appearance and structural advantages of a "full-face" 

design.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helmet for use
by a driver or rider of a vehicle such as a racing car
or a motorcycle.The cap bodies of crash helmets widely used in
recent years are classified into two types: a full face
type having a chin covering portion for covering a
user's chin; and a jet or open face type having no chin
covering portion, thereby exposing the whole of a
user's face.The cap body of the full face helmet protects a
wide area, owing to the provision of a chin covering
portion, but when a user wishes to smoke a cigarette or
to eat and drink, the chin covering portion is an
obstruction. For this reason, it is necessary to
remove the helmet each time. This is troublesome. The
cap body of the jet type helmet provides protection for
a reduced area of the user's head due to the absence of
the chin covering portion, but it is possible for the
user to smoke, eat or drink with the helmet in place.
Thus, both types of cap body have both advantages and
disadvantages.EP-A-0515753 discloses a full face helmet having a
sophisticated visor mounting arrangement which obviates
the need for visor mounting screws.DE-A-2846636 discloses a helmet having the
precharacterizing features of claim 1.According to the present invention, there is
provided a helmet having all of the features of claim
1.With the above construction, when the auxiliary
cap body is at the lowered position, the main and
auxiliary cap bodies constitute a full face type cap
body, thereby providing protective coverage for a large
area of the user's head. When the auxiliary cap body
is at the raised position, the entire large window 
opening of the main cap body is exposed, thereby
ensuring that the user can have a smoke or eat and
drink with the helmet in place, as is the case when
wearing a normal jet type helmet. This is convenient.
Moreover, if the auxiliary cap body is turned to the
lowered position, it is automatically locked to the
main cap body. Therefore, the user need not be
concerned whether or not the auxiliary cap body is
locked to the main cap body. Furthermore, it is
possible to reliably prevent the auxiliary cap body
from rising to the lifted position as a result of wind
pressure, vibration or the like.With the helmet as mentioned, the upper limit
restraining means contributes both to the restraint of
the upward movement of the auxiliary cap body and to
maintenance of the auxiliary cap body at the lifted
position. It is simple in construction and reliable in
operation.Further, if the stop arm is in abutment against

<CLAIMS>
A helmet comprising:

a cap body (1) which comprises a main cap body (2)
provided at a front surface thereof with a large window

opening (4) opened at a lower edge thereof, and an
auxiliary cap body (3) pivotally supported at left and

right opposite sidewalls of the main cap body (2);
the auxiliary cap body (3) being turnable between
a lowered position (A) for covering a lower portion of

the large window opening (4) so as to make an upper
portion of the large window opening (4) serve as a

smaller window opening, and a lifted position (B)for
opening the entire large window opening (4); and
a lock mechanism (39) provided between the main
and auxiliary cap bodies (2, 3) for automatically

locking the auxiliary cap body (3), when the auxiliary
cap body (3) is turned to the lowered position (A), the

lock mechanism (39) comprising a lock plate (40)
mounted on one of the main and auxiliary cap bodies (2,

3) and a lock pin (54) mounted on the other of the main
and auxiliary cap bodies (2, 3) for engaging with the

lock plate (40) at the lowered position (A) of the
auxiliary cap body (3), the helmet being characterized

by:
a spring means (52) for biasing the lock pin (54)
in a direction to engage the lock plate (40);
a releasing element (43) mounted on the auxiliary
cap body (3) such that the lock pin (54) is disengaged

from the lock plate (40) against a biasing force of the
spring means (52), the lock pin (54) being provided

with a slant (55) for inducing the lock plate (40) into
engagement with the lock pin (54) when the auxiliary

cap body (3) is turned toward the lowered position (A);
a control plate (21) secured to an inner surface
of the auxiliary cap body (3); and
an upper limit restraining means (32) provided 
between the control plate (21) and the main cap body

(2), the upper limit restraining means (32) comprising
a stop arm (25) formed on the control plate (21) and an

upper limit stop member (33) fixed on an outer surface
of the main cap body (2);
the upper limit stop member (33) being provided
with a stop wall (36) for receiving the stop arm (25)

to restrain the lifted position (B) of the auxiliary
cap body (3), and a crest portion (37) over which the

stop arm (25) climbs while being resiliently deformed,
immediately before the auxiliary cap body (3) reaches

the lifted position (B).
A helmet as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the stop arm (25) is in abutment against the

inner surface of the auxiliary cap body (3) so that a
resilient deformation is also generated in the
