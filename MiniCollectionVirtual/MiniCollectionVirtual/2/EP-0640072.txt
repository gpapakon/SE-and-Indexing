<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to derivatives containing a 3- or
4-pyridyl group, namely 3- and 4-pyridylcarbinol esters of
adamantanecarboxylic acid and adamantyl 2-(3- and 4-pyridyl)-ethyl
ketones, together with certain derivatives thereof, their
preparation and use in treating prostatic cancer.R. McCague, M. G. Rowlands, S. E. Barrie and J. Houghton,
J. Med. Chem. 33, 3050-3055 (1990), have reported that certain
esters of 4-pyridylacetic acid, of general formula:

   wherein Ra represents a specified alicyclic group (e.g.
cyclohexyl, adamantyl or a terpene residue) or

   wherein Rb represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,
inhibit the 17a-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase enzyme complex which is
essential for biosynthesis of androgens. The inhibition of
androgen biosynthesis by virtue of the hydroxylase/lyase
inhibition indicates that the compounds of McCague etal.,
supra, could be useful for the treatment of prostate cancer
since many such tumours depend on androgens for growth. The compounds of McCague elal. are also inhibitors of
aromatase. Aromatase is an enzyme required in the biosynthesis
of oestrogens. The ability to inhibit aromatase is considered a
desirable property in compounds which are to be used to treat
breast cancer. It is undesirable, however, for the treatment of
prostatic cancer that a compound should be a strong inhibitor of
both aromatase and hydroylase/lyase since the inhibition of
aromatase would prevent the removal, by further conversion into
oestrogens, of any products of the hydroxylase/lyase enzyme
complex which escaped the blockade of hydroxylase/lyase. As a
result, a patient could lose some of the benefits of
hydroxylase/lyase inhibition. Accordingly, it is desirable to
keep the lyase:aromatase inhibition ratio:
IC50 versus lyaseIC50 versus aromatase
as low as possible. (A small numerator indicates that the
compound is a powerful inhibitor of lyase. A large denominator
indicates that it is a poor inhibitor of aromatase).
Further prior art, the relevance of which is apparent only after
knowledge of the invention, is referred to below in a separate
section.It has now surprisingly been found that compounds of formula
(3) below have useful hydroxylase/lyase inhibitory activity with
low IC50 lyase/aromatase ratios, and are therefore of potential
value in treating androgen-dependent cancers such as prostatic
cancer. These compounds have the general formula:
wherein each of R1 and R2 independently represents hydrogen
or lower alkyl;A represents -O-, or -CR4R5 where R4 and R5 are defined as
