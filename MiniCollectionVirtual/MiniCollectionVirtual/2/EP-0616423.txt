<ABSTRACT>
A differential pair arrangement is disclosed which 
includes between the poles of a DC supply source the series 

connection of two parallel first branches and a common second 
branch. Each first branch includes the series connection of 

a first impedance Q2,Q3,RL/ Q2',Q3',RL', a main path of a 
transistor Q1/ Q1' and a second impedance RE/ RE', the 

control electrodes of transistors Q1/ Q1' constituting 
respective input terminals IN1/ IN2 of the arrangement. The 

second branch includes a first current source (CCS). The 
arrangement further includes two third branches between the 

DC supply source poles, each consisting of the series 
connection of a second current source ICS/ ICS', a respective 

transistor main path and a resistive impedance means 
R11,S11,R12,S12/ R11',S11',R12',S12'. These third branches 

result in an increased DC current through the corresponding 
transistor, thereby increasing the linearity of the 

arrangement, whilst the DC current through the first and 
second impedances does not increase, thereby not increasing 

the needed supply voltage nor the offset voltage of the 
arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a differential 
pair arrangement including, between a first and a second pole 
of a DC supply source, the series connection of two parallel 
individual first branches and a common second branch, each of 
said first branches including the series connection of a 
first impedance, a main path of a transistor and a second 
impedance, with the control electrodes of said transistors 
constituting respective input terminals of said differential 
pair arrangement, and said second branch including a common 
first current source. Such a differential pair arrangement is already 
known in the art, e.g. from the book 'Analysis and design of 
analog integrated circuits' by P. R. Gray and R. G. Meyer, J. 
Wiley & Sons, New York, 1977, and more particularly from Fig. 
3.29 thereof. Therein, both the first and second impedances 
are constituted by resistors. More particularly, these second 
impedances are emitter degeneration resistors and cause the 
differential pair arrangement to operate with lower 
distortion, i.e. with a higher operation linearity, as they 
introduce feedback. Indeed, from the above book it follows 
that the open loop gain of the arrangement is equal to the 
product of the emitter degeneration resistor value and the 
so-called transconductance (gm) of the transistors, so that 
when this open loop gain increases the distortion of the 
differential pair arrangement decreases and the operation 
linearity of this arrangement increases. This means that an 
increased linearity of the differential pair arrangement may 
be obtained by increasing either the emitter degeneration 
resistor value or the transconductance value. However, 
increasing the emitter degeneration resistor value also 
increases the so-called thermal noise introduced in the 
differential pair arrangement by this resistor, this thermal 
noise being proportional to the resistor value. On the other 
hand, increasing the transconductance value requires  
 
increasing the DC current through the transistors. 
However, because this DC current also flows through the first 
and the second impedances it produces additional DC voltage 
drops therein. Thus, increasing the DC current through the 
transistors implies providing a higher supply voltage for the 
differential pair arrangement. Secondly, producing a higher 
DC current through the transistors also increases the input 
offset voltage of the differential pair arrangement, since 
this input offset voltage is partly caused by the mismatch 
between the emitter
