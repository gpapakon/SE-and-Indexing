in semiconductor integrated circuits for analog applications, said 

circuits including high resistivity resistors formed in a layer of 
polycrystalline silicon and N-channel MOS transistors having active 

areas which have been obtained by implantation in a P-type well,

providing a first mask (9) over both said resistors (6) and the 
semiconductor regions where the low threshold voltage P-channel 

transistors (8) are to be formed,

The gate terminals (10) of the low threshold voltage P-channel MOS 
transistors therefore consist of P-doped polysilicon instead of 

N⁺-doped polysilicon. This results in a positive flatband voltage 
and thus in a low threshold voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming low 
threshold voltage P-channel MOS transistors in 
semiconductor integrated circuits for analog applications. In particular, the invention concerns a process for forming 
low threshold voltage P-channel MOS transistors in 
semiconductor integrated circuits for analog applications, 
which circuits include high resistivity resistors formed in 
a layer of polycrystalline silicon and N-channel MOS 
transistors having active areas which have been obtained by 
implantation. As is well known, CMOS processes are spreadly used to 
manufacture devices for analog applications, in view of the 
low power consumption and high integration density features 
of MOS devices compared to bipolar transistors. A prerequisite is, however, that the basic CMOS process be 
modified by the addition of new options, namely: 
high linearity capacitors (approximately 50 ppm/V, with a 
specific capacitance of 0.5 to 1 pF/µm²); high specific value precision resistors (approximately 1 
to 2 kohm/square); and low threshold MOS transistors (below 0.8 V). High linearity capacitors are either formed between two 
layers of polycrystalline silicon or between a layer of 
polycrystalline silicon and a diffusion. And to provide the  
 
required linearity values, they require very heavy doping 
of both electrodes. Precision resistors are formed in a lightly doped layer of 
slightly doped polycrystalline silicon which is normally 
obtained protecting the gate polysilicon from the N+ doping 
through an appropriate oxide mask. As to MOS transistors having polysilicon gate terminals, it 
is fairly difficult to obtain low threshold voltages and 
small gaps between the source and drain active regions, at 
one time and in both transistors of the CMOS pair. Both these features are much attractive in any transistor 
types, because they allow low supply voltages to be used 
while still affording high speed of response and high 
integration densities. Analog applications specifically require that transistors 
with low threshold voltages be used, both for improved 
linearity of response and on account of the present trend 
toward lower power requirements. To fully appreciate the 
aspects of this invention, mention should be made of the 
expedients that may be used to produce low threshold 
voltage transistors. A first reference is the work by A.S. Grove, "Physics and 
Technology of Semiconductor Devices", published by Wiley, 
where the threshold voltage of a MOS transistor is 
expressed as a function of
