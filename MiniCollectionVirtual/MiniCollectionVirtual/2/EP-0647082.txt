<ABSTRACT>
A data link controller (DLC) 52 is disclosed which 
employs buffers (100,106) on both receive and transmit 

sides. These last-in, first-out buffers contain a 
position indicating that a character is the last one of 

a packet. In this way, a user need not monitor 
reception or transmission on a character-by-character 

basis, but need only concern themselves with packets. 
The receive and transmit FIFO's generate requests for 

more characters by monitoring the number of characters 
stored and thereby automatically receive and transmit 

characters without processor intervention. A four-stage 
mechanism (600,602,604,606,608,610,612,614) permits 

monitoring of multiple contiguous frames (back-to-back 
frames) received. Control of the DLC is provided by 

status and control registers (112,212) which are 
accessible to the user via a microprocessor interface 

(50). Particular registers have bit positions 
monitoring status conditons in such a manner that the 

most-probable one of a set of conditions compries the 
least-significant bit position, while the least-probable 

condition occupies the most-significant bit position. 
This affords simple shift and test technique for 

monitoring status conditions.

entitled "Digital
Subscriber Controller"; U.S. Ser. No. 034,822, filed
April 3, 1987, (= EP-A-0 285 330)
entitled "Data Protocol Controller";
U.S. Ser. No. 035,684, filed April 2, 1987 (= EP-A-0 285 334),
entitled
"Enhanced Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter";
U.S. Ser. No. 035,683, filed April 3, 1987 (= EP-A-0 285 331),
entitled "Data Link
Controller with Flexible Multiplexer"; and U.S. Ser.
No. 035,687 , field April 2, 1987 ( = EP-A-0 285 329),
entitled "Dual-Port Timing Controller", all
assigned to the present applicant.This invention relates to data communication
networks that comply with international protocols and,
more particularly at the second level of protocol, a
data link controller providing packet-at-a-time status
reporting employing a delayed reporting mechanism.Data link controller (DLCs) are used in integrated
services digital networks (ISDNs) to provide a
high-speec serial interface to a telecommunication
network. Bit Oriented Protocols (BOPs) specify the data
format employed in transmission over the network and
call for transmission in "packets" complying with
certain norms.Typically, the status of individual characters with
a packet is reported. This creates excessive overnead 
time in monitoring the reception of a packet. And during transmission excessive
intra-packet intervention is required. Typically, packet boundaries were of no
significance.The limitations meant that complex programming requirements are imposed
on a DLC user and moreover, throughput of the DLC is compromised because of the
excessive processor time required in the character-by-character method of reception
and transmission of data.Reference may be made to Mini Micro Conference Record November 1983
San Francisco US pages 1 - 17 V Coleman et al "The Implementation of
Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 in VLSI" which describes in relation to Ethernet, a transceiver, a
serial interface adapter, a local area network controller.Compcon '86, March 1986, Washington US pages 70 - 75 P E Weston 'IC

bidirectional port means for high-speed serial receipt and transmission of signals, and
interface means connected to an internal bus for the connection of a microprocessor,
comprising transmitter means for parallel reception of data on said internal bus, for
