<ABSTRACT>
A process of producing an amylase inhibitor from 
an amylase inhibitor-containing solution extracted from 

wheat flour, etc with water, a dilute acid, a dilute alkali 
or from an amylase inhibitor-containing starch waste 

solution, by utilization of an adsorption of the amylase 
inhibitor on a calcium phosphate gel, while removing impure 

proteins contained in the solution. 
The process can produce in economy and high yields 
the amylase inhibitor having a very high amylase inhibitory 

activity but no or very little trypsin inhibitory activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes of producing
an amylase inhibitor from wheat, wheat flour or wheat gluten
or from a starch waste liquid and also to the application of
such amylase inhibitor as a medicine or food.The amylase inhibitors of wheat origin have been
investigated (see, Phytochemistry, Vol. 20, No. 8, pp. 1781-1784;
Eur. J. Biochem. 183, 37-40 (1989)).U.S. Patent 3,950,319 discloses that the amylase
inhibitor extracted from wheat with water, an acid or an
aqueous alcohol is used for the treatment of diabetes,
obesity and the like.The prior amylase inhibitors of wheat origin have
not achieved such effect as expected when orally
administered, which has the disadvantages of high cost and
reduced inhibition of digestion to glucose, particularly for
the digestion of heat cooked starch such as cooked rice.Under such situation, a process has been sought of
preparing in economy an amylase inhibitor which is effective
in an oral administration for the digestion of heat cooked
starch.Japanese Patent Kokai Hei 5-301898 (corresponding
to EPA 0567088 A2, Nisshin Flour Milling Co., Ltd.) 
discloses that the amylase inhibitors having a high amylase
inhibitory activity but substantially no trypsin inhibitory
activity can be produced by a process which comprises
extracting wheat, wheat flour or wheat gluten with water, a
dilute acid, a dilute alkali or an aqueous alcohol; adding a
polysaccharide to an extract and separating the resultant
insoluble complex from the solution; dissolving or
dispersing said complex in a solution, then separating the
polysaccharide from the solution to collect a solution
containing the amylase inhibitor; and treating the collected
solution with a cation exchanger to recover the amylase
inhibitor from fractions that have not been adsorbed on the
cation exchanger.An object of the invention is to provide a process
of producing in economy and in high yields an amylase
inhibitor having a very high amylase inhibitory activity but
no or very little trypsin inhibitory activity from an
extract solution of wheat, wheat flour or wheat gluten or
from a starch waste solution.Another object of the invention is to provide a
process of producing such amylase inhibitor with good
operability while controlling occurrence of loss even when
the amount of the solution treated is much.According to the present invention, there are
provided two processes including a principal step for the 
formation of a calcium phosphate gel and adsorption of the
amylase inhibitor thereon.The first process of the
