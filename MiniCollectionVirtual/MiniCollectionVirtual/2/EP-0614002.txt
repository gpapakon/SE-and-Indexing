<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the automatic injection of an additive into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle, from an on-board additive tank. According to the invention, the quantity of additive to be withdrawn from the additive tank (101) is calculated using an on-board computation unit (102), and the quantity of additive thus calculated is injected by pulsed spraying, this spraying being carried out directly into the liquid bulk of fuel. This pulsed spraying is preferably carried out by controlling a piston positive-displacement pump (112), with a number of piston strokes which is automatically determined as a function of the quantity of additive to be withdrawn.

Method for automatic injection of an additive 
into the fuel tank a motor vehicle, from an on-board 

additive tank, wherein the quantity of additive to be 
withdrawn from the additive tank (101) is determined 

using an on-board computation unit (102), as a function, 
on the one hand, of the variation in level of the fuel in 

the fuel tank (130) following refuelling, and, on the 
other hand, of a predetermined proportion set-point, 

characterized in that the quantity of additive thus 
determined is injected by pulsed atomization, this atomization 

being carried out directly into the liquid bulk 
of the fuel. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the proportion set-point can be adjusted by 

programming a console provided for this purpose in the 
on-board computation unit (102) and/or by direct operation 

on this computation unit. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the pulsed atomization of the additive is 

carried out by controlling a positive-displacement piston 
pump (112) which is interposed betwe
en the additive tank 
(101) and the fuel tank (130), with a number of piston 

strokes which is determined automatically as a function 
of the quantity of additive to be withdrawn. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the appearance of a minimum level 

of the additive contained in the additive tank (101) is 
detected, which minimum level is determined such that it 

is still possible to withdraw a quantity of additive 
corresponding to one fill of the fuel tank (130), and in 

that a luminous and/or audible alarm is triggered when 
such a minimum level is detected. 
Device for automatically injecting an additive 
into the fuel tank (130) of a motor vehicle, from an  

 
on-board additive tank (101), comprising : 


an additive injection circuit (103) connecting 
the additive tank (101) to the fuel tank (130), the 

said circuit comprising a reciprocating positive-displacement 
pump (112) arranged to withdraw a predetermined 

quantity of additive from the additive tank (101), and 
an on-board computation unit (102) used for 
determining the quantity of additive to be withdrawn from 

the additive tank (101), and controlling the actuation of 
the reciprocating positive-displacement pump (112) as a 

function of the quantity of additive thus determined; 
 
   characterized in that it further comprises a 

pipe (104) going from the output of the aforementioned 
pump (112) to the fuel tank (130), and penetrating therein, 

and an atomization member (124) carried by this pipe 
(104), at the end of the latter, the said member being 

positioned in order to carry out pulse atomization of 
additive directly into the liquid bulk of the fuel. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the reciprocating positive-displacement pump 

(112) is a piston pump, and the on-board computation unit 
(102) automatically determines the number of piston 

strokes as a function of the quantity of additive to be 
withdrawn. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized 
in that the positive-displacement piston pump (112) is 

mounted directly below the additive tank (101). 
Device according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that the pipe (104) penetrates into the 

fuel tank (130) through the opening (133) associated with 
the filler cap of this tank, passing through a sleeve 

(134) forming a filler extension, and is extended by a 
submerged portion (104.1), at the end of which the atomization 

member (124) is mounted. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized  
 

in that the pipe (104) is rigidly attached to the filler 
extension (134), for example being welded thereto, the 

said extension furthermore carrying, on the outside, a 
contact member (136) with which the cap of the tank (135) 

mounted at the top of its extension interacts, the said 
contact member being connected to the computation unit 

(102) in order to transmit data relating to the opening 
and reclosing of the said cap. 
Device according to one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that the computation unit (102) is 

programmable and/or comprises a set-point unit (214), so 
that the proportion set-point of the quantity of additive 

to be withdrawn from the additive tank (101) can be 
adjusted. 
Device according to claims 9 and 10, characterized 
in that the computation unit (102) is powered 

by the battery (202) of the vehicle, and the contact 
member (136) associated with the cap of the tank is 

mounted so as to be powered up when the vehicle is turned 
off.
