<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packages for dispensing stick-form 
products. More particularly, the invention relates to such packages 
having an elevator/threaded shaft dispensing means. The present 
invention has further relation to such packages having a reusable 
base adapted to receive a refill cartridge so as to make the package 
partially reusable. Cosmetic products such as antiperspirants and deodorants are 
typically packaged in what is referred to as swivel-up or 
elevator/threaded-shaft dispensing packages. An example of such a 
package is given in U.S. Patent 4,950,094 issued to Yorks on August 
21, 1990. Another example of such a package is described in 
WO93/05678. Such 
packages typically have a body with an oval cross-section having a 
threaded shaft axially oriented therein and rotatably mounted at the 
bottom end through an aperture. This threaded shaft is typically 
connected to a hand wheel on the exterior of the package's bottom for 
advancing the stick product out of the package. An elevator or 
follower is threadably mounted to the shaft on the interior of the 
package at its bottom. Turning the hand wheel in a predetermined 
direction will either advance the elevator towards the top of the 
package or retract it back towards the bottom. The cosmetic product 
is typically poured into the package in its liquid or molten state, 
with the elevator in its lowermost position, whereby upon cooling the 
product solidifies and takes on the shape of the package. 
Thereafter, to dispense the stick form product from the package one 
turns the hand wheel thereby rotating the threaded shaft and 
advancing the elevator towards the top of the package. As the  
 
elevator advances toward the top of the package it pushes the stick 
form product up and out of the top of the package so the user can 
have access. Recently, in order to reduce the consumption of natural 
resources and reduce solid waste landfill volume there has been the 
desire to make elevator/threaded-shaft dispensing packages partially 
reusable so that the entire package does not have to be thrown away 
after the initial product is used up. One way to accomplish this is 
to design a package that has a reusable base designed to receive a 
refill cartridge containing the solid stick form product. After the 
initial product in the package is used up, the initial refill 
cartridge is discarded and a new a refill cartridge is inserted into 
the reusable base, thereby rendering the package partially reusable.

<CLAIMS>
An elevator/threaded shaft stick dispensing package (1) for a 
solid stick-form product, said package having a cartridges (50) designed 

to telescope into a base (10), said package comprising 

(a) said base (10), comprising a tubular body (11) having an open top (12) 
and a closed bottom (13) having a central aperture (14) disposed 

therein, said base having a threaded shaft (15) axially 
oriented within its body and rotatably mounted on its 

bottom end through said central aperture wherein said 
shaft is connected to an hand wheel (16) adjacent said bottom 

on the exterior of said body; 
(b) said cartridge (50), comprising a tubular body (52) for holding a 
solid stick-form product (51), said body having an open top (53) and 

an open bottom (54), said bottom having a push plate (60) disposed 
therein adjacent its bottom; 
(c) a telescoping elevator system (30) disposed within said base, 
said elevator system comprising an internally threaded 

neck (31), adapted to receive said threaded shaft (15) in threaded 
telescoping relation, and a platform (32) above said neck 

designed to abut against said push plate (60) of said 
cartridge, whereby when said hand wheel (16) is turned in a 

predetermined direction said shaft (15) rotates and advances 
said platform (32) upwardly which advances said push plate (60) 

upwardly and pushes said stick product out through said 
open top of said package; and 
(d) a means for resetting said elevator (30) to its lowermost 
position when it is in its uppermost position without 

manually rotating said hand wheel. 
 
characterised in that said cartridge (50) is adapted to axially slide 

into said base (10). 
The package of Claim 1 wherein said cartridge includes a 
downwardly extending annular collar (70) adjacent its top, said collar 

designed to skirt over said top of said base (10). 
The package of any one of the preceding claims further 
including a means to secure said cartridge within said base wherein  

 
said collar (70) further includes at least one inwardly extending bead (71) 

and said base includes at least one outwardly extending bead (23) 
adjacent its top end, said beads being designed to snap fit over 

one another so as to secure said cartridge within said base. 
The package of any one of the preceding claims wherein 
said push plate (60) has a concave shape extending towards the top of 

said body of said cartridge, said push plate further including a 
plurality of apertures (61) extending therethrough so as to adhere said 

stick-form product to said push plate. 
The package of any one of the preceding claims further 
including a cap (100) to seal said top of said package when not in use. 
The package of any one of the preceding claims wherein 
said package has a non-circular cross-section when taken 

perpendicular to said axially oriented shaft (15). 
The package of Claim 6 wherein said cross-section is oval. 
The package of any one of the preceding claims wherein 
said internally threaded neck (31) of said elevator (30) is split into at 

least two internally threaded sections (31a,31b) adjacent its lower end, said 
means for resetting said elevator thereby comprising a means for 

moving said sections outwardly from said shaft (15), when said elevator 
is in its uppermost position, thereby disengaging the threaded 

engagement between said neck (31) and said shaft (15), said elevator then 
being free to move down towards its lowermost position, said neck (31) 

thereafter returning to threaded engagement with said shaft (15) when 
said elevator reaches its lowermost position. 
The package of Claim 8 wherein said neck (31) is split into two 
internally threaded halves (31a,31b) and said means for resetting said 

elevator (30) is characterized by: 

(a) a pin (41) extending through said platform (32) and down towards 
said neck (31), said pin having an up position and a down 

position; and  
 
(b) a lever (40) hingedly connected between its two ends to one of 
said halves (31b) of said neck (31), one end of said lever abutting 

against said other half (31a) of said neck and the other end of 
said lever abutting against said pin (41), whereby when said 

cartridge (50) is placed in said base (10) it pushes said pin (41) into 
its down position, thereby rotating said lever (40) about said 

hinge (42) and biasing said halves (31a,31b) of said neck (31) outwardly from 
said shaft (15) disengaging said neck from said shaft, said 

elevator (30) now being free to move to its lowermost position, 
when said elevator returns to its lowermost position said 

pin (41) returns to its up position re-engaging said neck with 
said threads. 
The package (101) of Claim 8 wherein said means for resetting 
said elevator (130) comprises a tubular sleeve (140) 

concentrically fitting over 
said neck (131) so that said neck is threadably engaged with said 

shaft (115), 
whereby when said elevator is in its uppermost position and said 

cartridge (150) is removed, said package has a means for moving said 
sleeve (140) away from said neck so as to disengage said neck 

(131) from said 
shaft (115) so that said elevator can freely move to its lowermost 

position, when said elevator (130) reaches its lowermost position said 
sleeve (140) is moved back over said neck (131) so as to threadably re-engage 

said neck with said shaft (115).
