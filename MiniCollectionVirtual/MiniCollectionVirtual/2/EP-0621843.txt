<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an aircraft having a wing free
for rotation about a spanwise axis to maintain a constant angle of attack
with the relative wind. More particularly, the present invention relates to
a wing which is selectively lockable and unlockable relative to the
fuselage to enable free rotation of the wing about the spanwise axis,
and hence flight in a free-wing mode, and fixation of the wing to the
fuselage at a predetermined angle of incidence, and hence flight in a
conventional fixed-wing mode.A "free-wing" is a wing attached to an aircraft fuselage in a manner such
that the wing is freely pivotable about its spanwise axis forward of its
aerodynamic center. This arrangement enables the wing to have an
angle of attack which is determined solely by aerodynamic forces, and
therefore, subject only to aerodynamic pitching moments imposed by
wing lift and drag. Rotation of the wing, without pilot intervention,
induced by positive or negative vertical wind gusts striking the wing
causes the angle of incidence or pitch between the wing and the aircraft
fuselage to vary so that the wing presents a constant angle of attack to
the relative wind enabling the aircraft to be essentially stall-free during
flight.Among other advantages realized when employing a free-wing are
increased resistance to stalls, increased C.G. (Center of Gravity) range,
alleviation of gust loads, e.g. on the order of a 4:1 reduction, which
translates to an increase in passenger comfort of up to 4,000% greater
than conventional fixed-wing aircraft, extension of the payload capability
due to the ability to reduce the structural weight of the aircraft, and the
ability to utilize a smaller engine with a lower fuel requirement, thus
increasing the flight range of the aircraft.Recognizing the advantages associated with free-wings, numerous
attempts have been made to adapt the concept of the free-wing to 
conventional aircraft, particularly in the field of general aviation.
However, as discussed below, the free-wing concept has only been
successfully applied to light or very light aircraft.U.S. Patent No. 4,596,368, issued to the present inventor is directed to
an ultra-light aircraft wherein a hang cage is suspended from a
collapsible Rogallo type-wing by a main hinge assembly. The wing
includes a longitudinal keel of light-weight tubular construction, leading
edge members, and a cross brace. A flexible lifting panel is secured
along and between these members to establish a lifting surface. The
hinge is clamped to

An aircraft comprising:

a fuselage (2);
a wing (4) having an aerodynamic center (AC) and connected to said
fuselage for free pivotal movement about a spanwise axis (7)

forwardly of said aerodynamic center (AC) thereby establishing
a free-wing mode of aircraft operation; and
means (6) for selectively locking said wing (4) at a substantially fixed
angle of incidence with resp
ect to said fuselage (2) to thereby
terminate said free-wing mode and to selectively establish

a fixed-wing mode of aircraft operation during flight
characterised
 by
said means (6) being adapted for selectively pivoting and actually locking said wing (4) at a
predetermined angle of incidence with respect to said

fuselage (2) independently of aerodynamic forces acting on the wing.
An aircraft according to claim 1
characterised
 in that

said locking means (6) includes positioning means connected

to said fuselage (2) and cooperating with said positioning
means to enable transition between a first postition

wherein said length link (17) does not transfer any forces
between said fuselage (2) and said wing (4) thus 

establishing a free-wing mode of aircraft operation, and
second positions wherein said length link (17) locks said

wing (4) to said fuselage (2) in a predetermined angle of
incidence thus establishing a fixed-wing mode of aircraft

operation.
An aircraft according to claim 2
characterised
 in that

said positioning means is a screw mechanism comprising a rod
(21) carried by said wing (4) and a shuttle block (22)

movable along said rod (21), said length link (17) being
connected to said shuttle block (22), and means for driving

said shuttle block (22) along said rod (21).
An aircraft according to claim 3
characterised
 in that

said shuttle block (22) includes a threaded bore and said rod
(21) is threaded and connected to said threaded bore, said

drive means comprising a motor (20) which reversibly
rotates said threaded bore.
An aircraft according to claim 3
characterised
 in that

said positioning means comprises a curved track (35)

characterised
 in that

said locking means (6) further comprises a damper (19) for
damping the pivotal movement of said wing (4) relative to said

fuselage (2).
An aircraft according to claim 6
characterised
 in that

said damper (19) is a fluid actuated cylinder (33) comprising a
movable piston (32) and a piston rod (18) thus establishing

a variable length link (17).
An aircraft according to one of the foregoing claims
characterised
 by

a control system (9) for controlling flaps (12) and elevators
(13) on said fuselage (2) and means (8) for disengaging said

control system (9).
