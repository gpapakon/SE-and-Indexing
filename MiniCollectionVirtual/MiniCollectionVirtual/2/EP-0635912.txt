<ABSTRACT>
A right-angled electrical connector (10) includes 
a dielectric housing (12) having a front mating face (28) 

and rear face (29) with a plurality of terminal-receiving 
passages extending therebetween. A plurality of terminals 

have forwardly projecting contact portions (64) in the 
passages and right-angled tail portions (66) projecting 

rearwardly from the housing. At least a first tail portion 
(66a) is longer than a second tail portion (66b), whereby 

their respective terminals have circuit paths of different 
lengths. A ground plate (68) extends alongside of and 

spaced from the first and second tail portions. A 
dielectric member (75, 76) is located between the ground 

plate and one of the first and second tail portions for 
controlling a circuit characteristic of the circuit path 

through the terminal of which the one tail portion is a 
part.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a right-angled electrical 
connector according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method 
for controlling the impedance or the propagation delay in a 
predetermined manner. With the continuing trend toward compact electronic 
apparatus, there is an ever-increasing demand for 
miniaturized interconnection systems between the electronic 
components of the apparatus. An example is in computer 
apparatus wherein there is a constant demand to reduce the 
thickness or height parameters of the electronic components. 
With the components mounted on a printed circuit board, the 
height parameters relate to the distance above the board in 
which desired interconnections are made and which constantly 
are being reduced. One type of electrical connector used in 
such applications is a right-angled connector which has a 
mating axis generally parallel to the printed circuit board, 
and with a plurality of terminals having right-angled tail 
portions projecting from the connector generally parallel to 
the board and then downwardly perpendicular to the board for 
interconnection with circuit traces on the board. An example of the use of such electrical connectors 
is to interconnect signal transmission lines to printed 
circuit boards, other electronic devices or to  
 
other complementary connectors. The transmission lines 
transmit signals through a plurality of conductors which, 
preferably, are physically separated and 
electromagnetically isolated along their length. In the 
electronics industry, particularly the computer industry, 
the predominant system embodies a plurality of plug-in type 
connectors in mating engagement with receptacle connectors 
on the computer, its main printed circuit board or other 
electronic devices. One of the connectors often is a 
right-angled connector, as described above. The 
transmission lines typically include coaxial electrical 
cables, either in round or flat form, and round cables 
presently are being used predominantly in relatively high 
frequency applications between various system components. Classical coaxial designs derive their 
characteristic impedance from the geometrical relationship 
between the inner signal conductors and an outer shield 
member and an intervening dielectric constant. For a given 
impedance, signal conductor size and dielectric material, 
an overall outside dimension is defined. The circuit 
characteristics along equal lengths of such conductors 
should be identical. In order to increase signal density 
and reduce the

A right-angled electrical connector (10) 
which includes a dielectric housing (12) mounting at least 

a pair of terminals, each having a contact portion (64) and 
a right-angled tail portion (66a, 66b) projecting 

therefrom, each said tail portion having a board mounting 

portion at an angle to said contact portion and a 
transition portion between said board mounting portion and 

said contact portion and including at least one bent 
region, the tail portion (66a) of one of said terminals 

being longer than the tail portion (66b) of the other, 
a tail aligning device (20) having apertures therethrough 

through which a portion of the board mounting portions 
extend, and a ground plate (68) spaced from and extending along 

substantially the entire length of said pair of terminals,
 
   characterised by
 
   dielectric member (75, 76) extending from the 

tail aligning device (20) alongside both a length of said board 
mounting portion and said bent region of said transition 

portion of one of the right-angled tail portions (66a, 66b) for 
controlling the relative dielectric constants of the region 

surrounding the tail portions.  
 
A right-angled electrical connector as set 
forth in claim 1, wherein said dielectric member (75) is 

located between the ground plate (68) and the first, longer 
tail portion (66a) for decreasing the impedance of a circuit 

path therethrough. 
A right-angled electrical connector as set 
forth in claim 1, wherein said dielectric member (76) is 

located between the ground plate (68) and the second, 
shorter tail portion (66b) for increasing the propagation 

delay of a circuit path therethrough. 
A right-angled electrical connector as seth 
forth in any preceding claim, wherein said dielectric member 

comprises a plate-like member (75, 76). 
A right-angled electrical connector as seth 
forth in any preceding claim, wherein a tail aligning device 

(20) includes apertures therethrough through which a portion  
 

of the board mounting portions extend and wherein said 
dielectric member (75, 76) extends in a cantilevered manner 

from the tail aligning device (20). 
A right-angled electrical connector as set 
forth in any preceding claim, wherein said tail aligning 

device (20) comprises a molded plastic component with the 
dielectric member (75, 86) integral therewith.

impedance or the propagation delay circuit characteristics 

of an electrical connector (10) according to claim 1 in a predetermined manner, 
comprising: 


selectively positioning a dielectric member (75, 76) 
alongside only one of the tail portions and between said one

dielectric constant thereof depending on whether the 

impedance or propagation delay is desired to be controlled 
in a predetermined manner, 
whereby positioning the dielectric member alongside 
the longer of the tail portions (66a) will increase the 

dielectric constant thereof and, thereby, decrease the 
impedance of a circuit therethrough, and 
whereby positioning the dielectric member alongside 
the other or shorter of the tail portions (66b) will 

increase the dielectric constant thereof and, thereby,  
 

increase the propagation delay of a circuit therethrough.
