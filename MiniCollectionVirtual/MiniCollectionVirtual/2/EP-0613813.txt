<ABSTRACT>
Radially adjustable running gear for a rail vehicle is proposed, which has double-axle bogie frames (2), the wheel set bearings/axle bearing housings (5, 10) of the two wheels (4, 9) of each side of the bogie being connected to one another by means of wheel set links (14, 20) and compensation levers (19, 35). The wheel set link (14, 20) is attached to the bogie frame (2) in a longitudinally displaceable fashion via a horizontally displaceable but vertically rigid coupling point (15, 21, 34). A connection link (16, 22, 36, 37) is provided between wheel set link (14, 20) and compensation lever (19, 35), which is connected to the wheel set link and to the compensation lever in each case via articulation points (17, 18, 23, 24, 32, 38, 39).
