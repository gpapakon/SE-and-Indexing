<ABSTRACT>
A cutting head for a cord-type mower driven by an engine (3) 
is disclosed. The cutting head includes a rotor capable of 

rotating about an axis and a bobbin (8) with a cord (11) wound on it. 
The bobbin can rotate relatively to the rotor about the axis in 

the rotor. The cutting head includes two types of cord feeding 
systems. The first cord feeding system automatically feeds a 

cord in response to cord wear. The second cord feeding system 
feeds a cord in response to a manual tapping operation executed 

during driving of the cutting head. The second cord feeding 
system disconnects one of the bobbin and rotor from the engine 

in response to the tapping operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a cutting head
for a cord type mower. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a cord feeding system for extending a cord wound on
a bobbin in a rotary casing to a length necessary for mowing.Many conventional cord type mowers have systems in their
cutting heads for feeding new cord when the current cord length
is insufficient. Also, manual-type cutting heads are known
which permit manual extension of the cord wound on a bobbin.At present, the so called tap-and-go type and automatic
type cutting heads are popular. For the tap-and-go type, the
cord is fed the required length by releasing an interlock
between a bobbin and a rotary casing. The interlock is released
either by hitting or strongly pressing the rotary casing
against the ground. This type of cutting head is disclosed in,
for example, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 2-16595,
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-26922, US-A-4161820, US-A-4183138,
and US-A-4189833.For the automatic type, the interlock between the bobbin
and rotary casing is released by the centrifugal force which
changes according to the length of the cord that extends from
the rotary casing. Thus, the desired cord length can be
maintained. This type of cutting head is disclosed in, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-22484, Japanese
Patent Laid-open No. 60-83508, Japanese Patent Laid-open No.
63-79522, Japanese Patent Laid-open No, 2-163003, US-A-347666,
US-A-4607431, US-A-4660286, and US-A-4817288.For the tap-and-go type, it is necessary for the operator 
to frequently check the length of the cord consumed during
mowing and extend the cord by hitting the rotary casing against
the ground at times or strongly pressing it. Otherwise, the
mowing efficiency greatly decreases. Therefore, the operator
always has to execute checking and hitting. The checking and
hitting give a large mental burden and physical load to the
operator.However, the tap-and-go type has the advantage that the
operator can freely set the cord length according to the state
of the material (such as grass) being cut. For example, when
grass is soft, it is possible to improve the operation
efficiency by extending the cord length which permits to the
cutter to mow at a faster rate. When grass is hard, it is
possible to ensure that the grass is cut by setting the cord
length to a relatively small value, which increases the cutting
force of the cord. Therefore, some operators prefer the
advantage of optionally setting the cord length according to
the

A cutting head for a cord type mower having a motor
or engine (3) for driving the cutting head, comprising:


a casing (4) drivable by the motor (3) to rotate about an
axis (7a);
a bobbin (8) mounted in said casing (4) and adapted to
rotate about said axis relative to said casing (4);
a cord (11) wound about said bobbin (8);
a cord feed slot (10) provided on the outer periphery of
said casing (4), for permitting the distal end of said cord

(11) to extend outside said casing (4) to a suitable cutting
position; and
coupling means for selectively coupling said bobbin (8)
to said casing (4) and for selectively automatically decoupling

said bobbin (8) from said casing (4) in accordance with the
rotational speed of said casing (4), which varies as a function

of the length of the cord (11) extended from said cord feed
slot (10);
said coupling means including:
a control plate (9) capable of slipping relative to said
casing (4) and a boss (54) capable of rotating together with

said control plate (9) for selectively coupling the control
plate (9) to said bobbin (8);
from three to six drive links (12) provided in said
casing (4) for reciprocating relative to said axis (7a) for

coupling the control plate (9) to said casing (4), said drive
links (12) being capable of moving between a transmitting

position and an idling position according to the centrifugal
force depending on the rotational speed of said casing (4);
in said transmitting position said control plate (9) is
coupled to said casing (4) for transmitting the rotation of

said casing (4) to said bobbin (8) via said control plate (9)
and said boss (54);
in said idling position said control plate (9) together
with said boss (54) and said bobbin (8) slip relative to said

casing (4);

links (12) towards said transmitting position from said idling

position;
said boss (54) being also capable of sliding relative to
said control plate (9) along said axis (7a), between a first

position and a second position;
in said first position said bobbin (8) is linked to said
boss (54) by a mutual linkage means (55, 57) and
in said second position said bobbin (8) is permitted to
rotate relative to said boss (54) by a predetermined angle via

rotation control means (56, 58);
urging means (20) for urging said boss (54) towards the
