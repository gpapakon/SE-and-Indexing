<ABSTRACT>
The urine of livestock is introduced into and stored in a urine collector, and the solid matter is separated as necessary from 
the urine to take out completely liquid excrement having urine as a main component. This liquid excrement is introduced into a 

treatment tank, to which various kinds of small pieces of rocks and soil humus are added to cause a bioreaction in aerating condition, 
whereby a humus forming reaction takes place owing to the actions of the soil humus and soil microorganisms contained in 

the liquid excrement as a raw material. The various kinds of small pieces of rocks added display their functions as catalysts for 
promoting the humus forming reaction to activate the soil microorganisms, which lead the excrement to the formation of humus, 

to the ultimate limit. This makes it possible to treat this liquid excrement speedily and efficiently and turn it into an odorless non-poisonous 
material, and also turn the liquid excrement into a concentrate of the active soil microorganisms and a metabolic product 

thereof and utilize the concentrate effectively as an agricultural material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
treating wastes from livestock such as urine, and specifically
to a waste treatment method that produces an aqueous solution
containing a high density of activated soil microorganisms
and their metabolic products which can be utilized as useful
agricultural materials.Growth in the livestock and dairy industries has
made it necessary to process increasingly large quantities
of animal wastes, which cause nasty and offensive odors
resulting in enviromental pollutions. The offensive odors
and other environmental pollution generated in barns also
place practical limitations on where dairy and livestock farms
can be located, for urine emits especially offensive odors
and contaminates water systems. The farming industry incurs
large operating costs in treating such waste on account of
the large-scale facilities and complicated processing
involved. Moreover, it takes a fairly long time to reduce
the offensive odors caused by urine to a tolerable level.Wastes or excretions from domestic animals, such 
as diary cattle, beef cattle, swine, sheep and the like,
contain organic materials, which- when properly treated- can
benefitably be reutilized for agricultural purposes. Wastes
from domestic animals have traditionally been turned into
compost and used as a fertilizer, but composting requires
much time and labor. Effective techniques have never
been developed to reuse solid wastes for fertilizer and
compost.In traditional composting, solid wastes, after
adjusting the water content, are cured in air for an extended
period with stirring periodically. At this time,
microorganisms in soil decompose this mixture into humus,
thus transforming it into compost. While, this natural
process has detrimental drawbacks such as requiring
a long curing time and much labor. Another disadvantage is
the difficulty to secure a physically and chemically stable
product. Given limitations in the availability of labor,
large-scale facilities and lands, traditional composting
can not be applied for today's large-scale livestock and
dairy farms, where large quantities of wastes are excreted
day-by-day.Among various forms of animal wastes, urine is the
most difficult to treat due to its high ammonia content. In
fact, an effective means for treating urine has never been
developed until now. The inventors of the present application have
studied recycling methods for treating urine and other liquid
wastes more efficiently with suppressing the emission of
nasty and offensive odors to convert a

<CLAIMS>
A method for treating liquid wastes of domestic animals
which comprises mixing the liquid wastes with soil humus,

bioreacting the mixture with aeration in the presence of
rocks and soil humus in order to accelerate the metabolic

activities of the microorganisms and extracting a liquid
component containing activated soil microorganisms and their

metabolic products from the mixture.
A method for treating liquid wastes of domestic animals
according to claim 1 which comprises raising the domestic

animals with drinking water containing dissolved minerals
from rocks and soil microorganisms, prepared by mixing in

water plurality of igneous rocks selected from andesite,
basalt, granite, rhyolite and peridotite and soil with

aeration, collecting liquid wastes from these animals, mixing
said wastes with a plurality of igneous rocks selected

from andesite, basalt, granite, rhyolite and peridotite and
soil humus for activating the soil microorganisms to convert

into an aqueous solution containing a high concentration of
activated microorganisms and their metabolic by-products.
A method for treating liquid wastes of domestic animals as
claimed in claim 2 wherein said drinking water consists of

water and an aqueous solution of a high concentration of
activated microorganisms and their metabolic products produced

by bioreacting urine-based excretions from domestic
animals in the presence of humus and rocks.
A method for treating liquid wastes of domestic animals
according to claim 2, wherein said aqueous solution is

sprayed in a barn in which domestic animals are raised. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein an apparatus
comprising at least one waste-water treatment tank which

contans soil humus and rocks is used.
