<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fire extinguishing system for railway vehicles, having a stationary container (1) for extinguishing fluid which can be acted upon by compressed air via a non-return valve (3), and having an extinguishing-agent line (8) which is connected to the stationary container (1) and has a throughflow indicator (12) and sprinklers (9). In order reliably to avoid extinguishing fluid passing into the compressed-air system and compressed air escaping from the sprinklers (9), the container (1) has a fluid reservoir (2) which separates compressed air and extinguishing fluid, is suitable for being acted upon by compressed air and has at least one connection to the extinguishing-agent line (8), said connection being independent of and separate from compressed-air connections on the container (1).

<CLAIMS>
Fire extinguishing system for rail vehicles with a
stationary container for extinguishing liquid which can

be exposed to the action of compressed air through a non-return
valve, and with an extinguishing medium line with

a flow indicator and sprinklers which is connected to the
stationary container, characterised in that the container

(1) comprises a liquid reservoir (2) which is suitable
for exposure to the action of compressed air and

separates compressed air and extinguishing liquid and
comprises at least one connection to the extinguishing

medium line (8) independent and separated from compressed
air connections on the container (1), and in that

components made of cross-linked thermoelastic plastic are
employed for the liquid-conveying components of the fire

extinguishing system.
Fire extinguishing system according to claim 1,
characterised in that the liquid reservoir (2) is made of

flexible rubber material.
Fire extinguishing system according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the liquid-conveying pipes are made

of cross-linked thermoelastic plastic.
Fire extinguishing system according to claim 1 or 3,
characterised in that the cross-linked thermoelastic

plastic is a polyethylene plastic.
Fire extinguishing system according to one or more
of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the compressed

air connections on the container (1) comprise shut-off
and monitoring devices (5a, 7a) which are independent of

one another.
