<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crankshaft
bearings, and especially to such bearings having
flanges designed to accommodate high thrust loads.It is common practice to support internal
combustion engine crankshafts with radial bearings
located at spaced points along the crankshaft. For
example, for an in-line 4-cylinder or V-8 engine,
five equidistantly spaced bearing assemblies are
used. Each bearing assembly includes an upper half
bearing seated in an arcuate recess in the lower 
part of the engine cylinder block, and a lower half
bearing seated in an arcuate cap structure. The
cap structure is bolted to the cylinder block to
retain the half bearings encircled around the
crankshaft.At least one of the bearing assemblies is
designed to absorb axial thrust forces applied
through the crankshaft and received from accessory
drive mechanisms such as automatic transmissions.
Each half bearing in such a bearing assembly has
two axially-spaced flanges designed to seat against
side surfaces of the shaft crank arms such that the
shaft is prevented from shifting in the axial
direction.In some high performance engines considerable
axial thrust is generated in the engine crankshaft
during certain operational periods, e.g., during
periods of rapid acceleration and deceleration.
Very large axial thrust loads may also be developed
by the action of the torque converter in the engine
transmission. Toroidal motion of the transmission
fluid in the torque converter tends to force the
impeller and turbine apart, thereby imparting a
significant axial thrust force to the crankshaft. 
The crankshaft thrust bearing is required to absorb
such thrust forces.Axial thrust forces are absorbed by only one
or two of the crankshaft half bearings since
manufacturing tolerance stack-ups tend to prevent
the flanges of multiple bearing assemblies from
simultaneous precise pressure contact with multiple
axially-spaced surfaces on the crankshaft. When
the thrust load is borne by a single flanged
bearing assembly, the unit area pressures on the
thrust bearing surfaces are relatively high.Flanged half bearings for rotary crankshafts
are shown in U.S. Patent 4,599,147 and U.S. Patent
4,702,624 and U.S. Patent 4,714,356. The half
bearings shown therein have radial thrust bearing
flanges equipped with oil supply groves or pockets
for distributing oil on the flange surfaces,
thereby providing at least a partial oil film
support between the rotary shaft runner surface and
the stationary thrust bearing surface. U.S. Patent
4,488,826 shows the use of wedge

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a half bearing for a rotary shaft
(13), said half bearing (17,19) comprising a semi-cylindrical

wall (25,27) and a radially extending thrust bearing surface
(29) located on an axial end portion of said wall, said thrust

bearing surface (29) comprising oil supply means (49) and

further comprising a hydro-dynamic contour (57) formed
therein, wherein the oil supply means (49) is formed by

machining material from the associated thrust bearing surface
(29), the thrust bearing surface (29) being pre-sized by a

machining operation, and characterised in that the hydro-dynamic
contour (57) is formed by a low force metal

deformation operation after formation of the oil supply means
(49).
The method of claim 1 wherein said hydro-dynamic contour
(57) is formed by a coining operation.
The method of claim 2 wherein the coining operation is
accomplished with a die (65) that has a zero slope flat spot

(69) thereon registerable with said oil supply means (49).
The method of claim 1 wherein said hydro-dynamic contour
(57) is formed by a stamping or press-formed operation.
A flanged half bearing (17,19) produced according to the
method of any one of the preceding claims. 
The half bearing of claim 5 wherein said hydrodynamic
contour comprises a circumferentially extending ramp surface

(57) and a circumferentially extending land surface (59).
The half bearing of claim 5 further comprising a one
piece element that includes a semi-cylindrical wall (25,27)

having a convex surface and a concave surface, and two flange
walls (29,29) extending radially from the convex surface of

said semi-cylindrical wall (25,27); each flange wall (29)
having an external axially-facing surface (31) and an internal

axially-facing surface (33) ; said concave surface constituting
a radial bearing surface; each external axially-facing surface

(31) constituting a thrust bearing surface; wherein said oil
supply means (49) are formed in each thrust bearing surface

and subdivide the associated thrust bearing surface into a
plural number of thrust bearing pads (50) ;

wherein each thrust bearing pad (50) comprises a
circumferentially extending ramp surface (57), said ramp

surface (57) being effective to induce a flow of lubricating
oil from the oil supply means (49) along the ramp surface

(57), whereby a lubricant film is maintained between each
bearing pad (50) and the rotary shaft (13).
The half bearing of claim 7, wherein each thrust bearing
surface intersects the concave surface of said semi-cylindrical

wall (25, 27) to form a circumferentially-extending
corner (43); each said corner being configured as

a chamfer surface. 
The half bearing of claim 7, wherein said one-piece
element is a bimetal element comprising a relatively thick

steel layer (53) and a relatively thin anti-friction metal
layer (51); the anti-friction layer (51) being oriented to

define the radial bearing surface and both thrust bearing
surfaces (31).
The half bearing of claim 7, wherein said one-piece
element is formed of a one-piece bimetal element comprising

a steel layer (53) and an anti-friction metal layer (51).
