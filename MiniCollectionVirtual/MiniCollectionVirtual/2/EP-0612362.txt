<ABSTRACT>
A paper machine drying apparatus is disclosed for drying a first and a second side of the web. The apparatus includes a first single tier drying section for drying only the first side of the web (12). The first drying section includes a first plurality of dryer cylinders (58, 63) for drying the first side of the web, and a first plurality of vacuum rolls disposed in close proximity between adjacent dryer cylinders of the first plurality of dryer cylinders. A second single tier drying section for drying only the second side of the web (12) in which the drying section includes a second plurality of dryer cylinders (94-99) for drying the second side of the web, such cylinders (94-99) being disposed immediately downstream relative to the first drying section. A second plurality of vacuum rolls are arranged such that each vacuum roll is disposed in close proximity between adjacent dryer cylinders of the second plurality of dryer cylinders (94-99). At least one of the vacuum rolls of the first and the second drying sections have a smaller diameter than the diameter of any of the dryer cylinders of the first and second drying sections, and the second drying section is a displaced downstream mirror image of the first drying section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for drying a web of paper
according to the preamble of claim 1.As used throughout this specification, the term "single tier" or
"single tier drying section" refers to a drying section having sequential
rows of dryers with the axes of rotation of the dryers in each row lying in
a common plane.Also, as used herein, the term "joint run of the felts" means a path
of the felts wherein the felts are brought into sufficiently close proximity
to each other to effect a transfer of the web from one felt to the other felt
while minimizing web flutter. The joint run need not be a parallel run of
the felts.With the ever increasing operational speed of papermaking
machines, a serious problem has existed in that there is a tendency for the
paper web or sheet to flutter as the sheet progresses through the dryer
section. Such sheet flutter is particularly evident when the sheet is
transferred between succeeding sections of the dryer section as the web
is transferred between these adjacent sections in an open draw. Such
sheet flutter has been minimized by the use of single felting configurations
in which the web and felt run jointly between respective top and bottom
cylinders. However, the single felt configuration, although reducing the
aforementioned problem of sheet flutter, introduces several disadvantages.
Included amongst these disadvantages are, first, the heat transfer from
the bottom cylinders is substantially reduced because the wet web is no
longer in direct contact with the cylinders, the felt being interposed
between the web and the drying surface of the respective cylinder.
Second, the web has a tendency to separate from the felt as the web  
travels towards and around and then away from the bottom cylinder.
Third, the initial threading of the web is not particularly easy.A partial solution to the aforementioned single felt problems has
been provided by the application of the so-called BelRun dryer section.
BelRun is a registered trademark of Beloit Corporation. With the BelRun
system, the bottom, ineffective dryers are replaced by vacuum rolls which
positively convey the web from one cylinder to the next. Recent
installations of this type of dryer section have shown that the BelRun
concept can be extended to include a large number of dryers without any
adverse effect on the web runnability. Such runnability results because
the vacuum rolls are capable of conveying the web along the
felt-supported spans without the need for sheet tension or section draw
points.With the
