<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a device for suspending especially a substantially longitudinally extended object comprising at least one cla mping component (1) which can be directionally moved against a wall or another component (1) in order to hold the object firmly between them through its own weight. The at least one component has at least two vertically spaced supporting sections (3, 5) and/or at least one flat supporting region which can engage in one side of the object when it is clamped or suspended and force the object against the wall or the other component.

Device for arranging, in particular, an elongate object 
in a suspended manner, comprising at least one clamping 

element which can be moved towards a wall or towards an 
additional element so as to hold the object in a clamped 

manner in between by means of its own weight, characterised 
in that the element (1), of which there is at least one, 

comprises at least two support sections (3, 5), which are 
disposed at a spacing from one another in the vertical 

direction, and/or at least one plane support region (4), 
provided to act on a side of the object (30) when it is 

clamped or suspended and drive the object towards the wall 
(21) or the additional element (1), wherein the element is 

arranged such that it can swivel so that the sections (3, 
5), of which there are at least two, or the plane region (4) 

can in each case be swivelled about two axes (8, 10; 8a, 
10a), i.e. each section (3, 5) can be swivelled about a 

respective axis or the area (4) about at least two axes in 
the manner of a parallelogram, so that the movement towards 

the wall (21) or the additional element (1) to clamp the 
object (30) is a curved downwa
rd movement. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
element (1), of which there is at least one, is arranged on 

or at a plate-like element (17) such that it can essentially 
swivel in relation to the wall (21) or the additional 

element (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the element (1), of which there is at least one, is 

a clamping jaw, and the sections (3, 5) provided to form the 
jaw or the connection between the sections (3, 5) and/or the 

plane region (4) are formed so as to be essentially parallel 
in relation to the wall (21) or in relation to the sections 

(3, 5) or areas (4) provided on the additional element (1) 
for clamping purposes.  

 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that a longitudinal extent of the sections (3, 5) or the 

area (4) is arranged so as to extend essentially 
perpendicularly to the plate-like element (17). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the additional element (1) comprises at least one 

point-like, elongate or plane support, towards which the 
object which is to be clamped can be driven by means of the 

one element (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the one element (1) is a clamping jaw which is 

formed in the manner of a parallelogram, with one side (11) 
firmly connected to the plate-like element (17) and the 

opposite side (4) being movable parallel to one side such 
that it can swivel towards the wall (21) or the additional 

element (1) to clamp the object. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the clamping jaw (1) is made at least in parts of a 

flexible or elastic material, in order to enable the 
opposite side (4) to swivel in relation to one side (11). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the one element (1) is formed in the manner of a 

parallelogram and is firmly connected by one side (11) to 
the plate-like element (17), although without a freely 

mobile opposite side, so as to form a quasi U-shaped clamp 
which is open at the front and has two terminal edge-like or 

strip-like sections (3, 5) which extend parallel to one 
another and largely perpendicularly to the plate-like 

element (17). 
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
edge-like sections (3, 5) are bent upwards in order to form 

a respective wall (3b, 5b) bent in the manner of a clamping 
jaw, the two walls being arranged largely vertically one 

above the other in the non-clamping state.  
 
Device according to one of claims 8 and 9, characterised 
in that the quasi U-shaped clamp (1) comprises a rear 

holding body (11) which is made of a rigid material and in 
which the two U-limbs (3, 5) are held, wherein the two U-limbs, 

which extend parallel to one another, are made of a 
flexible or elastomeric material in order to enable the two 

preferably plane or strip-like sections, which are each 
arranged at the ends of the limbs, to swivel towards or away 

from the additional element or towards or away from the 
additional clamp. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised 
in that the sections (3, 5) and/or the plane region (4) 

is/are roughened at least in parts, or is/are coated with a 
material which increases sliding friction. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised 
in that the additional element (1) is formed so as to be 

largely two-dimensionally symmetrical in correspondence with 
the one element (1) and is arranged opposite the latter, and 

that both elements are arranged such that they can swivel 
with respect to one another. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that a plurality of elements are arranged opposite a wall 

or a preferably corresponding number of additional elements 
in the vertical direction. 
Arrangement for arranging elongate objects of different 
thicknesses or different dimensions in a suspended manner, 

comprising one or more devices according to one of claims 1 
to 12, characterised in that the element (1), of which there 

is at least one, is in addition secured to a plate-like or 
rail-like additional element (17) such that it can be 

displaced laterally, preferably steplessly, and released 
again in order to clamp the objects of different thicknesses 

or widths.  
 
Arrangement according to claim 14, characterised in that 
at least the one or two respective elements (1) or clamping 

jaws associated with one another is/are arranged on a 
respective guide plate (16), which guide plate(s) comprises 

(comprise) at least one respective section (20b) which 
embraces the plate- or rail-like additional element (17) at 

the top and possibly at the bottom, as well as a clamping or 
holding means (20a, 20c; 41), which is staggered in the 

longitudinal direction of the additional element or disposed 
at a spacing therefrom, in order to retain the guide plate 

(16) at the plate- or rail-like additional element (17) in a 
releasable manner. 
Arrangement according to claim 15, characterised in that 
the embracing section(s) is (are) formed so as to be at an 

oblique angle to the guide rails at the additional element 
(17), wherein guide slots (20d) for the guide rails (17) are 

provided in the section or sections (20b), which slots are 
dimensioned such that when the respective guide plate (16) 

is released and swung away and the section or sections (20b) 
is (are) arranged essentially perpendicularly to the rail or 

rails, the guide plate can be freely displaced along the 
additional element (17), although the rail(s) is (are) at 

least almost clamped in the guide slot (20d) when the guide 
plate is fixed by the clamping or holding means (20a, 20c) 

at the additional element (17). 
Arrangement according to claim 15, characterised in that 
the clamping or holding means comprises an eccentric member 

(41), by means of which the guide plate (16) can be secured 
in a releasable manner at the plate- or rail-like additional 

element (17) by turning or tensioning.
