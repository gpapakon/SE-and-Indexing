<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a motor comprising two components (11, 12) which are movable with respect to one another, having opposing faces (13, 14) in contact with one another. Travelling surface acoustic waves are produced in the same direction in each of the opposing faces of each of the components. The speed or the relative position of the components is adjusted by acting on the frequency or the relative phase of the travelling waves.

<CLAIMS>
A motor including: 

two parts (11, 12; 22, 23) that are mobile one with 
respect to the other and have facing surfaces (13, 14) 

contacting each other, 
means (24, 25) associated with each part to produce on 
each facing surface progressive surface acoustic waves of the 

same direction, and 
control means (91, 92) for adjusting the relative 
frequency or phase of said progressive waves. 
The motor of claim 1, characterized in that said two 
parts are substantially identical and have the same resonance 

acoustic frequency. 
The motor of claim 2, characterized in that the 
progressive waves generated on the two parts have frequencies 

close to said resonance frequency. 
The motor of claim 3, characterized in that the 
control means apply a predetermined phase difference with 

respect to a reference phase between the progressive waves 
applied to each of the two parts, whereby one of the parts 

moves by a predetermined distance with respect to the other. 
The motor of claim 2, characterized in that the 
progressive waves generated on each of said two parts have 

distinct frequencies, close to said resonance frequency, 
whereby the rotation speed of one of the parts is 

predetermined with respect to the other. 
The motor of any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that said mobile parts are two coaxial rings with facing rims 

contacting each other. 
The motor of any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the progressive waves are applied by piezoelectric 

ceramic portions constituting sectors of opposite polarities 
of a ring bonded to the surfaces of each part that is 

opposite to their contacting surfaces.
