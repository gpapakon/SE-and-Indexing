<ABSTRACT>
Insulin sensitivity enhancers, such as troglitazone, have the ability to treat and/or
prevent hyperuricemia and may thus be used for the therapy or prophylaxis of such

diseases as gout, urinary calculus, hyperuricemic nephropathy and Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to use of an active agent for the preparation of a
medicament for the treatment or prevention of hyperuricemia, in which the active agent is an
insulin-resistance improving substance, commonly referred to as "insulin sensitivity enhancers
wherein the insulin sensitivity enhancer is selected from
a thiazolininedione compound.Hyperuricemia is a disease characterized by an abnormally high level of uric acid
in the plasma. Plasma is saturated with uric acid at 7.0 mg/dl, and, if the level of uric
acid in the blood reaches or exceeds this level because of a metabolic disorder
involving uric acid, the resulting condition is called "hyperuricemia". When the
concentration of uric acid in the blood exceeds a certain level, uric acid precipitates as
monosodium urate and may deposit in various tissues, such as the cavitas articulare or
kidney. This deposition may cause gout, renal disorders or angiopathy.
Hyperuricemia may be caused by reduced excretion of uric acid, by its excessive
production or by a combination of both. Hyperuricemia may also result from other
diseases, such as an enzymatic abnormality in the purine metabolism. These are all so-called
"primary causes". Other diseases, such as disorders of the hemocytopoietic
organs and renal disorders, and administration of certain medicaments, such as
pyrazinamide or thiazide, may also result in hyperuricemia, and are "so-called
secondary causes".Examples of diseases caused by hyperuricemia include gout (including acute
gouty arthritis and chronic tophaceous arthritis), urinary calculus, hyperuricemic
nephropathy (chronic gouty nephropathy, acute hyperuricemic nephropathy) and
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.Initial treatment of the symptoms of hyperuricemia, particularly gout, may be by
the administration of an analgesic agent, such as colchicine, and/or an analgesic anti-inflammatory,
such as indomethacin. It is common practice to treat the longer term
problem of hyperuricemia by control of the diet, for example by limiting the intake of
alcohol or by controlling intake of calories. However, if this dietetic treatment does 
not work sufficiently well, the disease may be treated by the administration of drugs,
for example by the prophylactic administration of an analgesic agent, such as
colchicine, or by means of a uric acid excretion stimulator, such as probenecid,
sulphinpyrazone, ketophenylbutazone, bucolome or benzbromarone, or a uric acid
synthesis inhibitor, such as allopurinol.In recent years, insulin sensitivity enhancers have been
