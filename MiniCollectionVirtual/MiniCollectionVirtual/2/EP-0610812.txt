<ABSTRACT>
A hook-and-eye fastener (1) comprises fastener members including 
a hook and an eye (10,30), each member 

having a pair of engaging prongs (15a,15b) 
projecting substantially perpendicularly therefrom, and retainers (20) 

adapted severally to immobilize the fastener members and intended 
to be disposed on the side of a fabric (110) opposite to the side 

thereof on which the fastener members (10) are set in place. Each 
of the retainers (20) has a pair of thin-wall parts (24a,24b) adapted to be 

pierced by the pair of engaging prongs (15a,15b) of the relevant fastener 
member (10) , and leading ends of the engaging prongs (15a,15b) of each fastener 

member are formed in the shape of a flat part lying in a plane 
substantially perpendicular to a direction of penetration of the 

engaging prongs (15a,15b) 
into the thin-wall parts (24a,24b) of the relevant retainer (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hook and to an eye for a hook-and-eye
fastener each comprising a pair of engaging prongs projecting
substantially perpendicularly therefrom; and a retainer
adapted severally to immobilize the hook or eye, respectively,
and intended to be disposed on the side of a fabric opposite to
the side thereof on which the hook or eye, respectively, is set
in place; the retainer having a pair of thin-wall parts adapted
to be pierced by the pair of engaging prongs of the hook or
eye, respectively.The conventional hook-and-eye fasteners, as disclosed in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,639,983 issued to Fukuroi et al. on Feb. 3, 1987,
comprise a recurved hook made of brass, an eye made of brass and
adapted to have the hook caught thereon, and retainers made of
brass, adapted severally to fix the hook and the eye, and
disposed on the side of a fabric opposite to the side thereof on
which the hook and the eye are seated. The hook and the eye are
each provided integrally with a pair of engaging prongs adapted
to be fixed in the relevant retainers. The retainers severally
have formed therein a pair of through holes adapted to be
inserted thereinto by the pair of engaging prongs. The fixation
of the hook and the eye to the fabric is accomplished by
positioning the retainers on the opposite side of the fabric,
inserting the engaging prongs of the hook and the eye through the
fabric into the through holes of the retainers, and then bending
the engaging prongs inwardly toward each other thereby joining
the hook and the eye infallibly to the respective retainers.
Incidentally, the leading end parts of the engaging prongs are 
formed in a sharply pointed acute angle shape as indicated by a
two-dot chain line in Fig. 4 so as to facilitate the penetration
of the engaging prongs through the fabric.In the prior art hook-and-eye fastener described above, the
insertion of the engaging prongs into the through holes of the
retainers entails the problem that the engaging prongs having
sharply pointed leading terminals force their way between
adjacent component threads of the fabric while dragging the
fabric into the through holes and leaving wrinkles behind in the
fabric around the sites of insertion. Further, the insertion
of the engaging prongs into the through holes poses the problem
that the leading end parts of the engaging prongs catch hold of
threads of the fabric while piercing the fabric, drag the
threads in the longitudinal and lateral direction of the fabric
in the parts of the insertion of the engaging prongs and,
