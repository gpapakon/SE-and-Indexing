<ABSTRACT>
A change-over command for the cross-connection matrix controlling the cross-connection of digital transmission lines (AU4#1...#16) must be distributed to all modules (T, S) of the cross-connect so synchronized that the error-free operation of the cross-connect can be maintained also during the change-over of the matrix. According to the invention this is made in two steps, whereby a preparatory signal ('special') is transmitted to all synchronization circuits (AU/TU), and then a byte (CM) indicating the change-over command is transmitted from the synchronization circuits (AU/TU) through the cross-connect in the frame administrative block carried in the signal flow (AU-4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the introduction
of claim 1 for error-free change-over of the cross-connection
matrix in a cross-connect for digital transmission lines, the
cross-connection matrix containing the routing information
through the cross-connect. If the cross-connection matrix
change-over is asynchronous there occurs unacceptable errors in
the cross-connection.The synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) comprises an entirety,
quite extensive and planned for advanced development, for the
transmission of digital signals in the telecommunications
network, the trunk network of which is evolving from separate
PCM coded links towards a remotely controlled cross-connection
network. The recommendation CCITT G.707 specifies signals with
a transmission rate of 155.520 Mbit/s for the Synchronous
Transport Module (STM-1) of the first level SDH-signals. The
basic STM-1 frame comprises bytes (8 bit), and their number is
2430 including the monitoring blocks; then one STM-1 frame will
carry e.g. 63 subsystem containers (e.g. a TU-1, Tributary Unit,
which can contain the 2 Mbit/s signal of a conventional 30 channel
PCM system). The STM-1 frames are repeated 8000 times in a second,
which is the same rate as in the subsystem; each byte of the
frame forms then a 64 kbit/s channel. The SDH-signals or
transport modules are created by interleaving the bytes of the
subsystem signals. The frames are joined to form multiframes.An SDH DXC can carry traffic between different SDH levels, and
connect traffic between different signals. A typical higher level
cross-connect (DXC, Digital Cross Connect, CCITT draft recommendations
G.sdcx-1...-3) is the so called 4/1 cross-connect,
in which 2 Mbit/s channels are connected between the incoming
and outgoing ports. An important objective for the cross-connect
is to optimize the utilization rate of the transmission network. Further it must be able to perform a flexible reconfiguration of
the network, i.e. to reroute the connections, and to guarantee a
rapid start-up of stand-by connections in network failure
situations. The mentioned CCITT SDH-recommendations intend to
define the logical function, i.e. the functional structure of
equipment, but they avoid a detailed description of the equipment
structure.In this respect US-A-4 804 956 discloses a space switch, where all addresses
in the same stage of the switch are changed simultaneously, and where
successive stages are changed in synchronism with successive ticks of the system clock.The digital cross-connect is much
