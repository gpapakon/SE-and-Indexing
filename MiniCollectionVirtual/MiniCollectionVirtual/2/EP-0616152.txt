<ABSTRACT>
A gear box mounting (10) for a motor vehicle has a first 
member (11) adapted to be mounted with respect to the 

vehicle gear box (16) and a second member (12) adapted to 
be connected to a sub-frame (32). The first and second 

members (11, 12), are interconnected by resilient 
elements (40, 41) inclined towards one another in a plane 

transverse to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle in 
order to provide vertical and lateral compliance of the 

gear box (16) relative to the sub-frame (32). Buffering 
means (47, 48, 49) are provided between the first member 

(11) and the second member (12) and between the first 
member (11) and the sub-frame (32) to provide continuous 

and progressive buffering in the vertical upward and 
downward directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gearbox mounting for a 
motor vehicle. FR-A-2155594 and US-A-4151822 disclose resilient 
mountings which provide compliance in vertical, lateral 
and longitudinal directions. The mountings also provide 
for buffering of movement in the upward and downward 
directions. These designs do not however readily lend 
themselves to the provision of buffering means to control 
movement in the lateral and longitudinal directions. The present invention provides a resilient mounting which 
readily lends itself to the provision of buffering means 
to control movement in the lateral and longitudinal 
directions. The resilient mounting of the present 
invention further utilises surfaces of the sub-frame to 
which the resilient mounting is secured for buffering 
purposes, considerably simplifying the design and 
manufacture of the resilient mounting. According to the present invention a motor 
vehicle has a gearbox mounted resiliently with respect to 
the vehicle by means of a gearbox mounting, the gearbox 
mounting comprising a first member secured to the 
gearbox, said first member having a vertical axis, and a 
second member mounted to a sub-frame of the vehicle the 
second member having a central axis extending normally 
thereof which is coincident with the vertical axis of the 
first member, the first and second members being 
interconnected by a pair of resilient blocks, the 
resilient blocks being located one on either side of the 
vertical axis of the first member and being inclined 
towards one another in a plane transverse to a 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle in order to provide 
vertical, lateral and longitudinal compliance of the  
 
gearbox relative to the sub-frame, buffering means being 
provided to provide buffering in the upward and downward 
directions, characterised in that the second member is 
secured to the sub-frame on a side thereof remote from 
the gearbox, the first member extending through an 
aperture in the sub-frame and being connected to the 
gearbox, the buffering means being provided between the 
first member and the remote side of the sub-frame to 
provide buffering of gearbox movement in the vertical 
direction away from the sub-frame and the buffering means 
being provided between the first member and the second 
member to provide buffering of gearbox movement in a 
vertical direction towards the sub-frame. Preferably the resilient means are of relatively low 
spring rate giving low spring rates in the vertical, 
fore/aft and lateral directions,
