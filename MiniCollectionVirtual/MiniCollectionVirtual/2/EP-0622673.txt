<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic elements containing colour
couplers and in particular to elements containing a class of couplers.Colour couplers are known to belong to a number
of classes, for example magenta dye-forming couplers
can be pyrazolones, pyrazolotriazoles and
pyrazolobenzimidazoles while yellow dye-forming
couplers can be acetanilides.Compounds falling within general formulae (I) and
(II) below are described in Manley et al, J Med Chem
35, 2327-2340 (1992), EP-A-104423 and Rajappa,
Tetrahedron 37, 1453-1480 (1981) but no use as a
photographic colour coupler is disclosed nor are
photographic silver halide materials containing them
described.There is always a need for new classes of
couplers that have advantages over those already known
to the art.The present invention provides a new class of photographic elements containing
couplers capable of forming yellow dyes having good
spectral characteristics such as maximum wavelength
(λmax), little unwanted absorption of green light and
low continued coupling in the bleach.According to the present invention there are
provided photographic elements comprising a support,
at least one photosensitive silver halide layer and in
or adjacent said silver halide layer a colour coupler
of one of the general formulae: 

wherein
R1is a group substantially without any
electron-withdrawing capability having
a Hammett sigma value of less than
0.03,R2is a substituent not incompatible
with the function of the compound,R3is an alkyl, aryl or heterocyclic
group any of which may be substituted, or acyl
andXis a coupling-off group.The present couplers form dyes on coupling with
oxidised colour developing agent, for example yellow
dyes. The couplers, compared to presently used
couplers, show less unwanted green absorption and
display less continued coupling in the bleach.Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings are
D LogE curves as described in Example 3 belowExamples of groups which R1 may represent are
hydrogen, or a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic,
a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or
unsubstituted heterocyclic group. The aliphatic group
may be cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, 
saturated or unsaturated. Examples of such groups are
straight chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl groups of
1-20 carbon atoms, preferably 1-10 carbon atoms;
cycloaliphatic groups of 3-20 carbon atoms; phenyl; or
substituted phenyl.Examples of groups which R2 may represent are
hydrogen, halogen (eg F, Cl or Br), thioalkyl,
thioaryl, alkyl, substituted
