<ABSTRACT>
METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF AN AIRTIGHT, RECYCLABLE 
AND BIODEGRADABLE PACKAGE wherein each package is 

characterized in that it has lateral walls which form a 
tube, bottom folding walls which by means of folds and 

folding lines close one of the ends of said tube making a 
container for a product, that is the load of the package, 

and top walls which - with their corresponding folds and 
folding lines - close the other end of the tube, so that 

the packed product is occluded inside ; characterized in 
that a cardboard sheet (a) is stamped to mark the folding 

lines which limit the lateral walls, the top walls and the 
bottom of the package, as well as the adhesive bands; said 

sheet is sterilized; a fast-drying adhesive substance is 
applied on the adhesive bands between the walls; the 

cardborad sheet is folded so that the adhesive bands 
overlap in pairs so that the lateral walls form a tube; the 

ends are closed by folding the bottom walls making a flat 
base; and after filling the package with the product, the 

top walls are closed likewise; the adhesive in the adhesive 
bands is activated and therefore the filled airtight 

package is finally closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the means used in the
manufacturing of airtight packaging in general, more
specifically it relates to a method for the manufacturing
of an airtight package which is not only recyclable but
also biodegradable.Sachets are widely used in order to pack all
kinds of consumer products. Said sachets are a tube-shaped
waterproof bag, closed by cross stitching in both its ends.This kind of packaging, although it is low-cost,
poses a series of problems and drawbacks. It may be easily
punctured or damaged ; stacking is extremely difficult due
to its shape; it cannot stand on its base, and this, in
turn, makes handling difficult.Similarly, multilayer-packaging is also widely
used. Multilayer-packaging consists of a cardboard piece
(a) lined by layers made of either aluminium or plastic, or
other materials.Contrary to the former, this kind of packaging,
can hold all sorts of products, keeping them in excellent
conditions and at relatively low cost.Moreover, in the case of consumer foods, this 
kind of packaging is resistant enough, easy to open and
easy to use when serving (as the folded lugs in its top
wall have a funnel-like shape when open). Furthermore, the
material it is made of guarantees an airtight closing; it
is not polluting, and neither the nutritional properties of
the foods packed in them nor the taste thereof will ever
be affected.On the other hand, another advantage of this kind
of packaging, is that it is prismatic and rectangular,
which not only remarkably enables the handling thereof but
also allows it to stand safely on its flat base, and makes
stacking easier even if storage space is limited or small.However, the above mentioned multilayer packaging
poses a serious drawback, which in the light of the current
ecological trends and guidelines towards preservation,
should be taken into account.In fact, as this packaging consists of aluminium
sheets and plastic layers, once it is used it cannot be
recycled, and most important of all, it is not
biodegradable.The aforesaid means that, although this kind of
packaging has contributed significantly, it is a real
polluting factor, specially due to the fact that, as it is
used for mass consumption products, it becomes a part of
the huge mass of pollutants which contaminate the soils, 
the environment, and is impossible to dispose of.There is, therefore, a known method of
manufacturing an airtight package which is made of a sheet
and has lateral walls which are glued in order to shape a
tube; bottom folding walls stamped with

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing an airtight package which
is made from a sheet (a) and has lateral walls (14,15,15',16)

which are glued in order to shape a tube (30); bottom folding
walls (24), stamped with folding lines (3,4,5,6) which close

a first end of said tube making a container for a product,
that is to be loaded into the package, and top walls (24'),

with their corresponding folding lines and lugs, which shape
a second end of the tube, in such a way that the product

loaded therein is occluded; characterised in that said sheet
is a recyclable and biodegradable cardboard sheet (a) which

is stamped so that the folding lines form lateral walls
(14,15,15',16), a top wall (24'), and a bottom of the package

as well as flaps for adhesive bands; applying a fast-drying
reactivatable substance on the flaps to form the adhesive

bands; folding the flaps in pairs whereby they overlie the
lateral walls, so that the lateral walls form a tube-shaped

package; activating the adhesive substance in order to secure
the walls in question; forming the first one of said ends of

said tube by folding the bottom walls and activating the fast
drying reactivatable substance at said first end in order to

shape a flat base, filling the package with the corresponding
load, and thereafter forming the second one of said ends of

said tube by folding the top walls and the adhesive substance
is activated to define the airtight closure once the adhesive

on the overlapping flaps has been activated.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cardboard sheet is stamped so that the folding lines

limit the lateral walls, the top wall and the bottom of the
package, as well as the flaps for the adhesive bands; said

sheet is sterilized; a fast-drying reactivatable substance is
applied on the flaps; the cardboard sheet is folded along the

corresponding folding lines, so that the flaps for the
adhesive bands overlap with the limits of the lateral walls;

the adhesive in said bands is activated in order to define
the tube-like shape of said walls; the corresponding folding

lines in the bottom of the package are folded, and the 
adhesive in the adhesive bands that overlap with said walls

is activated in order to define the bottom of the package, at
the same time it is folded to define a flat base; said

package is filled, and the opening thereof is closed by
folding the top walls and activating the adhesive substance

applied in the respective bands.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in

that the cardboard sheet is stamped with a continuous line to
mark the folding lines which limit the lateral walls, the top

walls, and the bottom of the package, as well as the flaps
for the adhesive bands between the walls; said sheet is

sterilized; a hot fast-drying adhesive substance is applied
on the flaps; the stamped cardboard sheet is placed in a

shaping mandrel (33), in such a way that the flaps for the
adhesive bands that limit the lateral walls overlap, until a

tube-like container is shaped; the adhesive in that area is
therm-activated by the pressing of heating clamps (34); the

tube is taken to a vertical mould (35), where one of the ends
of said tube is shaped by overlapping the adhesive bands of

the bottom, by therm-activation of the adhesive substance
thereof and by the pressing of heating clamps; the walls of

said bottom are folded and the adhesive substance activated
so that a flat bottom is shaped; the container is filled with

the product to be packed; the other end of the lateral walls
is closed, by activating the adhesive substance and by

folding the top walls, so that a flat top is shaped so that
the product is occluded inside the airtight package.
A method according to claim 2 or 3, characterised
in that three of said adhesive bands correspond to the

lateral walls, as well as the top walls and the bottom,
respectively, each respective one of said adhesive bands

overlapping with the limits of a respective wall, said
adhesive being simultaneously applied to said three adhesive

bands. 
A method according to claim 2, 3 or 4,
characterised in that the sterilizing means used is sodium

peroxide.
A method according to claim 5, characterised in
that the cardboard sheet is sterilized by spraying with

sodium peroxide.
A method according to claim 2, 3 or 4,
characterised in that the cardboard sheet is sterilized by

means of ultraviolet rays or gamma rays.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the sheet is stamped, thus defining the folding lines of

a large number of packages to be shaped; said stamped sheet
is rolled up, and an adhesive applicator is fed-in with said

sheet in a continuous way; the adhesive is applied hot in
three adhesive bands, which overlap in pairs, which

correspond to the limits of the lateral walls as well as the
top walls and the bottom, respectively; the sheet is then cut

into individual blanks by means of cutting cross lines; each
blank is then placed in a shaping mandrel, so that the

adhesive bands which limit the lateral walls overlap, so that
a tube is made; the adhesive substance is activated in said

area by pressing of a heating clamp; the tube is then taken
to a vertical mould on which one of the ends is closed by

making the adhesive bands of the bottom overlap; thermo-activating
the adhesive by means of heating clamps; the

bottom walls are folded so as to shape a flat base; the
container is then filed with the product; the other end is

closed, by activating the adhesive, by folding the top walls
in the same way as the bottom walls, so that the product is

finally occluded in the package.
A method according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the cardboard sheet has also a

waterproof layer.
