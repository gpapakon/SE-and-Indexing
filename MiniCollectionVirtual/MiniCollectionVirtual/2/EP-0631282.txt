<ABSTRACT>
The recorder comprises a magnetic head (19) which can be 
translated in directions (21) and (23) between an operating position, 

in which the head 
cooperates with a magnetic tape in an inserted cassette (3), and a 

withdrawn position, in 
which the head is clear of an inserted cassette. In the withdrawn 

position the head can 
be pivoted about a pivotal axis (25) between a first angular position 

and a second angular 
position. The head is electrically connected to stationary parts of the 

recorder by means 
of a flat flexible multiple electrical conductor (27), such as a foil 

carrying printed 
electrical conductor tracks or a flat cable. The conductor is arranged 

as a cylindrical 
spiral about the pivotal axis (25) and its end (55) which is remote 

from the head is 
connected directly to stationary parts of the recorder, so that 

translations of the head in 
the axial direction result in the spiral being extended/compressed and 

pivotal movements of the head result in the spiral being coiled/uncoiled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic cassette recorder comprising a magnetic
head which is pivotable about a pivotal axis between a first angular position and a second
angular position and which is electrically connected to a flat flexible multiple electrical
conductor, such as a foil carrying printed electrical conductor tracks or a flat cable, which
conductor is arranged as a cylindrical spiral about the pivotal axis and has an end which is
remote from the head, which end is connected directly to the stationary parts of the recorder,
so that pivotal movements of the head result in the spiral being coiled/uncoiled.Recorders of this type are used mainly for audio applications employing
cassettes for recording and reproduction in both a forward and a reverse direction, such as the
well-known Analog Compact Cassette recorders and the Digital Compact Cassette recorders
(DCC recorders). In recorders of this type the tape is scanned in two adjacent parallel zones,
one zone being scanned in one direction and the other zone being scanned in the other
direction. The magnetic head may be constructed in such a manner that in fixed position it is
capable of cooperating correctly with each of the zones in each of the two tape transport
directions. However, in many cases a head of simpler construction is used, which must be
reversed to cooperate with the relevant zone of the tape in the reverse transport direction. With
this construction the head requires a smaller number of active transducing gaps than a head for
a recorder using the first-mentioned construction. However, a consequence is that a
mechanism must be provided for the reversal of the head, which partly outweighs the price
advantage gained by the use of a simpler head. Some heads have many transducing gaps, such
as the heads for DCC recorders, which have at least nine digital write gaps and nine digital
read gaps and a number of additional gaps, such as two analog read gaps, i.e. at least twenty
transducing gaps in total. Consequently, a large number of electrical conductors are needed to
transfer signals between the head and the stationary electronic circuitry of the recorder.
Providing a reliable electrical connection between pivoting and translating heads having such
a large number of transducing gaps and the stationary parts of the recorder at a moderate cost
price is a major technical challenge.The US-A 4,945,437 discloses a magnetic head mechanism in a magnetic tape
apparatus, a magnetic head being supported in such a way that it is reversible
