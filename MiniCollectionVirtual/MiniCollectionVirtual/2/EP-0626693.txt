<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field 
of microelectronics and in particular to a method and 
apparatus for sensing signals from a memory array. Still 
more particularly, the present invention relates to a 
method and apparatus for selecting and sensing signals 
from a memory array. Memories are devices that respond to operational 
orders, usually from a central processing unit (CPU) of a 
digital computer. A sense amplifier is typically employed 
to detect attenuated signals from a memory array. Two 
types of sense amplifiers are typically used: a static 
sense amplifier and a dynamic sense amplifier. Dynamic 
sense amplifiers are often used because they have low 
current consumption and the sense amplifiers are activated 
only when required to perform sensing functions. Referring to Figure 1, a memory array 100, a 
multiplexer 102, and a sense amplifier 104 are depicted in 
a configuration known to those skilled in the art. Memory 
array 100 contains a number of bit line pairs that may be 
accessed using word lines (not shown). Frequently in 
memory arrays, such as memory array 100, sense amplifier 
104 is shared among many columns of the memory array. In 
addition, the data fed into sense amplifier 104 might be 
multiplexed between different blocks of columns within 
memory array 100. In the depicted example, left block 
100a and right block 100b of memory array 100 share sense 
amplifier 104. Two pairs of data lines, LBT, LBC, RBT, 
and RBC originate from memory array 100 and are connected 
to multiplexer 102. Data lines LBT and LBC originate from 
left block 100a of memory in memory array 100; data lines  RBT and RBC originate from right block 100b in memory 
array 100. Data lines LBT and LBC carry left block true 
and complement data signals respectively, while data lines 
RBT and RBC carry right block true and complement data 
signals respectively. Multiplexer 102 is used to select 
data from one pair of data lines and is connected to sense 
amplifier 104. Sense amplifier 104 may include a number 
of different stages. Referring next to Figure 2, sense amplifier 104 may 
include the following stages: level shifter 106, current 
mirror 108, and p-channel cross-coupled amplifier 110. A 
level shifter is typically employed to shift the voltage 
of the multiplexed signals in order to optimize the other 
stages of the sense amplifier. Typically, level shifter 
106 is used to adjust the voltage of the signal selected 
by multiplexer 102 in order to optimize the performance of 
the other
