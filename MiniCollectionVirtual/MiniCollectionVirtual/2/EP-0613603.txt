<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a circuit for processing output signals from at least two microphones spaced relative to a sound source. Circuit (10) has inputs (11, 12) which are connected to the respective outputs (13, 14) of microphones (15, 16). The microphone (15) is directed to a sound source (17) whilst the microphone (16) is directed away from that sound source. A sound path (19) is defined between the microphones (15, 16). The inputs (13, 14) are connected to a summing junction (22) via respective amplifiers (20, 23) and in one channel the signal is inverted and in the other channel the signal is delayed. By suitable adjustment of gain and delay, the circuit can be arranged to either cancel noise generated from a sound source other than (17) and/or to adjust the directionality of the microphone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
ftA Circuit for use with MicrophonesThis invention relates to a circuit for processing output signals from at least two microphones spaced relative to a sound source. 5 It has been proposed for sometime to form a directional microphone by using a single diaphragm with a cavity on each side. Each cavity is connected to a respective input and the input which is furthest away from the sound source of interest is provided with an acoustic delay in the form of10 baffles and the like creating a longer sound path. If the spacing between the inputs and the delay created within the rear input are each equivalent to X/4 then sounds received from the direction of the intended source are effectively added at the diaphragm, but sounds reaching the rear input15 first are cancelled at the diaphragm. This arrangement has several disadvantages: first it is very difficult to adjust the acoustic delay, secondly it takes no account of the loss in sensitivity between the rear and front inputs and hence cancellation is incomplete and thirdly it is extremely20 frequency dependent.From one aspect the invention provides a circuit for processing output signals from at least two microphones spaced relative to a sound source and producing respective output signals, comprising an input for each microphone,25 means for time delaying the output signals of all the microphones bar one relative to the output signal of said one in accordance with the intended relative spacing between 

 each microphones and said one microphone; means fo inverting the output of the one microphone or the outputs o the other microphones or microphone; means for attenuatin or amplifying one or more of the output signals so as t select the relative amplitudes of the output signals derive from sources other than the sound source and means fo summing the processed output signals to provide a final output signal.The delay means may delay signals after they have passed through the inverting means and/or the amplifying and attenuating means and indeed the order of processing is not important and the inversion and gain adjustment can be carried out on either set of signals. The time delay means are preferably pure time delay means so that they do not introduce phase shifting and thus, at least over the audio range, are substantially frequency independent. For example, they may be constituted by a linear all pass filter, a digital delay line or surface wave device. Similarly it will be understood that the invention covers circuits in which the one output signal is
