<ABSTRACT>
An automatic focusing apparatus includes a circuit 
(5) for integrating high frequency component of a video 

signal every field to generate a focus evaluating value; a 
control unit (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 30, 110, 

131) for moving position of a focusing lens (1) so that 
the focus evaluating value attains the maximum value; four 

memories (41 to 44) for respectively storing focus 
evaluating values of four fields successively supplied 

from the focus evaluating value generating circuit 5; and 
four memories (52 to 55) for storing four position data of 

the focusing lens corresponding to the focus evaluating 
values. The automatic focusing apparatus further includes 

a circuit (61) for calculating an amount of change of the 
focus evaluating value based on the focus evaluating 

values of the current and second last fields, a circuit 
(63) for calculating an amount of change of the lens 

position corresponding thereto, and a circuit (65) for 
calculating the rate of change of the focus evaluating 

value based on these amounts of change. The automatic 
focusing apparatus further includes a circuit (62) for 

calculating an amount of change of the focus evaluating 
value based on the focus evaluating values of the last and 

the third last fields, a circuit (54) for calculating an 
amount of change of the lens position corresponding  

 
thereto, and a circuit (66) for calculating rate of change 

of the focus evaluating value based on these amounts of 
change. The automatic focusing apparatus further includes 

a circuit (67) for comparing the change rates from these 
two change rate calculating circuits. In response to the 

comparison output from the change rate comparing circuit, 
the speed of moving the focusing lens is made lower when 

the change rate of the focus evaluating value is 
decreasing than when increasing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
automatic focusing apparatus, and more particularly, to an
improvement of an automatic focusing apparatus for
automatically matching the focus relative to an object in
response to a video signal obtained from an image sensor,
in an image sensing apparatus such as a video camera
having an automatic focusing mechanism.Conventionally, in an automatic focusing apparatus
used in an image sensoring apparatus such as a video
camera, an approach utilizing a video signal itself
obtained from an image sensor for evaluating the state of
focus control has been developed. According to such an
approach, a lot of good characteristics can be obtained.
For example, there exists substantially no parallax. In
addition, even if the depth of field is small and an
object is located in the distance, the focus can be
exactly matched. Furthermore, according to this approach,
a specific sensor for automatic focusing need not be
separately provided, so that the apparatus has very simple 
mechanism.As one example of such a focus control method
utilizing a video signal, a control method so-called hill-climbing
servo system has been conventionally known. The
hill climbing servo system is described, for example, in
United States Patent Nos. 4,922,346 and 5,003,339.
Briefly stated, a high frequency component of a video
signal is detected every one field as a focus evaluating
value, the focus evaluating value is always compared with
a focus evaluating value detected one field before, and
the position of a focusing lens is continuously slightly
vibrated such that the focus evaluating value always takes
the maximum value.In the above described hill-climbing servo system, if
only the slope of a focus evaluating value is detected,
the focusing lens is not stopped in the defocused position
by always driving the focussing lens in the direction of
increasing the focus evaluating value, even if the object
is changed, so that very good follow-up characteristics
with respect to the object can be achieved.Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing the whole structure
of the automatic focusing apparatus and Fig. 7 is a block
diagram showing details of the focus evaluating value
generating circuit of Fig. 6.Referring to Fig. 6, the video camera includes a 
focusing ring 2 for moving forward and backward the
focusing lens 1, a focusing motor 3 for driving focus ring
2, an iris mechanism 21 for adjusting exposure, and an
image sensor circuit 4 including an image sensor (not
shown) such as a CCD.An image formed on
