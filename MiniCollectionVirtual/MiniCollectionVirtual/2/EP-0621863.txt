<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new class of
substituted pyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives having a
wide range of activity as herbicides.Pyridine derivatives have, for many years, been
investigated for use in biological sciences. For
example, 2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyridinols have been
found useful as herbicides and fungicides as disclosed
in U.S. Patent 3,748,334. Such compounds are
characterized by substitution in the 4-position by a
hydroxy radical. In addition to the hydroxy radical,
the pyridine nucleus may also be substituted with bromo,
chloro or iodo radicals. Trifluoromethyl pyridine
derivatives have also been disclosed in U.S. Patent
Nos. 2,516,402 and 3,705,170 wherein the nucleus is
further substituted by halogens as well as numerous
other substituents. Some of these compounds are also
noted to be useful as herbicides.Also known because of their fungicidal activity
are 4-substituted 2,6-dichloro-3,5-dicyanopyridines
wherein the 4-position is substituted with alkyl,
phenyl, naphthyl or pyridyl groups. Such compounds are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,284,293, while similar
compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,629,270
wherein the 4-position is substituted with a
heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is oxygen or
sulfur.In EPO Patent 44,262 there are disclosed 2,6-dialkyl-3-phenylcarbamyl-5-pyridinecarboxylates
and 5-cyano-compounds
useful as herbicides. There is no
disclosure of the 2-haloalkyl radicals or any
substitution in the 4-position of the pyridine ring.The pyridine derivatives have also received
attention in the search for new herbicides and have been
reported in U.S. Patents 1,944,412, 3,637,716, and
3,651,070. All of these patents disclose polyhalo
derivatives of dicarboxypyridines. All have in common 
the direct substitution on a ring carbon by a halogen in
the 3-and 5-positions while the 2- and 6-positions are
occupied by carboxylate groups. The 4-position is open
to substitution by a wide range of materials including
halogens, hydroxy radicals, alkoxy, and carboxyl groups.
Such compounds have found utilization as herbicides,
bactericides, and fungicides. When the 4-position is
occupied by a silver salt, U.S. Patent No. 1,944,412
discloses that such compounds have been utilized in the
production of X-ray pictures with intravenous injection
of such compounds.Pyridinedicarboxylate compounds useful as
herbicides are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,692,184.
These compounds have fluorinated methyl groups at the 2-and
6-positions and carboxylic acid derivative at the
