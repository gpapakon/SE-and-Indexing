<DESCRIPTION>
 BLENDS OF EPOXY RESINS, PHOSPHATE ESTERS OF EPOXY RESINSThe present invention pertains to a blend or mixture of an epoxy resin and a phosphate ester of an epoxy resin; curable compositions containing such blend; coating compositions containing such curable compositions; articles prepared from the curable compositions; and articles coated with such coating compositions.The can and coil coating industry has an almost universal need for coatings with better flexibility and formability characteristics. Three-piece can technology is being replaced by two-piece can technology. The two-piece technologies, for example, draw-redraw (DRD), are very demanding on the applied organic coatings. DRD is a process for making two piece cans in which a circular blank is drawn through a die to form a circular cup and then redrawn through a second or third die to produce a can of desired dimensions. Since tlie DRD process uses pre-coated metal coil, there is an industry demand for more formable can coatings to withstand the stress associated with the can formation process. In today's market, precoated sheets of metal are subjected to many severe operations in order to form the metal into an assortment of shapes. These operations include stamping, drawing, redrawing, flanging, beading, riveting, and folding.Formability tests typically used in the can and coil industry can be classified as slow or rapid deformation techniques. Some examples of slow deformation tests are T-bend, Erichsen indention, Erichse cupping test and the beading test. Examples of fast deformation techniques include wedge bend, Gardner impact test and actual can stamping.It would be desirable to have available coating systems which provide an improvement in one or more of the properties: flexibility, acid resistance, oil and fat resistance, and the like.The present invention pertains to a blend or mixture comprising ( A ) at least one compound containing an average of more than one vicinal epoxide group per molecule;- 1 

(B ) at least one compound containing an average of two phenolic hydroxyl groups per molecule; and(C) at least one epoxy phosphate ester; wherein components (A) and (B) are present in an amount which provides a ratio of phenolic hydroxyl groups per epoxide group of from 0.05:1 to 20:1, preferably from 0.05:1 to .8:1, more preferably from 0.05:1 to 0.6:1; and component (C) is present in an amount of from 1 to 80, preferably from 5 to 50, more preferably from 10 to 30 percent by weight based on the combined weight of components (A and B).
