least five optical axes from a first optical axis to a fifth 
optical axis constituting center axes thereof, the second axis 

and the fourth axis being parallel with each other, one ends on

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an expandable and tiltable 
optical system and optical apparatus. Products capable of making 
use of this include telescopes, surveying optical appliances 
(such as a level, a transit, etc.), astronomical telescopes, 
binocular telescopes, microscopes, binocular microscopes, 
periscopes, sights, various projection apparatuses (a projector, 
a projection machine, etc.), cameras, movie projection machines, 
broadcasting large television cameras, monitoring cameras, etc., 
and objective lens barrels, eyepiece lens barrels, photographing 
lens barrels, projection lens barrels, and the like. In the past, in the observation 
of the heavenly bodies near the zenith by, for example, a 
refracting astronomical telescope, the eyepiece lens barrel is 
at a lower position and directed downwardly. Therefore, a viewer 
has to kneel down to direct only his face upward or has to lean 
over the handrail to lie down. Moreover, since the heavenly 
bodies to be observed gradually move, the position of the eye 
portion changes accordingly. The 
viewer has to follow this to change the attitude of the body as 
well as his face in particular. For such reasons as described, 
the viewer is often forced to take an unnatural attitude for a 
long period of time for the observation of the heavenly bodies. 
The viewer always feels a great fatigue. In order to improve such situations as noted above, a 
diagonal prism unit 1 is inserted into a sleeve at the lower end 
of a telescope, as shorn in Fig. 1, to thereby bend the direction 
of a light path at right angles for the observation in an easy 
attitude. This improves the easiness of the attitude for the  
 
viewer to some extent, but still the viewer is often forced to 
take an unnatural attitude. Further, there is no difficulties for a person to support the 
weight of a telescope belonging to a surveying appliance, a fixed 
type binocular telescope or the like. However, since the height 
of the telescope is determined depending on a tripod or a mount, 
it is often that the height of a telescope and the height of eyes 
of a viewer are not in one straight line. In such cases, the 
height of a telescope has to lowered to the viewer, or the 
viewer has to stand on tiptoe or hump up his back to lower his 
head. A fixed type telescope shown in Fig. 2 is useful to improve 
the above-mentioned situation to some extent. These include 
binocular telescopes for monitoring or sight-seeing, a bird-watching 
telescope, etc. According to the feature of these 
telesc
