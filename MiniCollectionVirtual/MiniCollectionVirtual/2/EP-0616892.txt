<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink jet printhead formed of a silicon 
substrate (11), a thin film resistor layer (13) disposed on 

the silicon substrate, a patterned metallization layer (15) 
disposed on the thin film resistor layer for defining a 

plurality of ink firing resistors (16) in the resistor 
layer, and a barrier layer (19) overlying the resistor 

layer and the metallization layer and having firing chamber 
openings (21) formed therein. The metallization layer 

further includes a reference target pattern (51), and the 
barrier layer further includes a reference opening (53) 

overlying the target reference pattern which is configured 
such that the alignment of reference opening relative to 

the target reference is representative of the alignment of 
the respective firing chamber openings relative to the 

associated underlying ink firing resistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the art and 
technology of thermal ink jet printing and more particularly 
to a new and improved thin film resistor (TFR) printhead 
architecture and geometry which is used in the manufacture 
of disposable thermal ink jet (TIJ) pens. In the design of the thin film resistor printheads 
used in the manufacture of thermal ink jet pens, it has 
been a common practice to photolithographically define and 
electrically interconnect a plurality of heater resistors, 
such as those made of tantalum aluminum, on a thin film 
substrate and then construct a corresponding plurality of 
aligned firing chambers and associated orifice openings 
above and adjacent to the heater resistors. These firing 
chambers and orifice openings are used in ejecting ink from 
a region within the firing chambers and above the heater 
resistors and onto a print medium. As is well known, these 
firing chambers have commonly been constructed of a selected 
polymer material disposed on the TFR substrate and on 
top of which an orifice plate such as a gold plated nickel 
material is disposed and aligned with respect to the firing 
chambers. The polymer barrier layer is also photolithographically 
defined so as to have a predetermined firing 
chamber geometry and pattern adjacent to which an ink feed  
 
channel or port is used to fluidically connect each firing 
chamber with a source of ink supply. In operation, electrical drive pulses are selectively 
applied to conductive traces leading into the various 
heater resistors situated in the bottom of each firing 
chamber to thereby heat the ink to boiling in each firing 
chamber and above each heater resistor. This resistor 
firing in turn produces a vapor bubble and a corresponding 
pressure field within the firing chamber used for thermally 
ejecting ink onto an adjacent print medium. In one general architecture of firing chambers, the 
cross-sectional geometry of the firing chambers defined by 
the walls of the polymer barrier located between the thin 
film resistor substrate and the orifice plate was partially 
rectangular in shape and of a three sided wall construction. 
The firing chambers and ink flow ports connected 
thereto function not only to define an ink flow path and 
ink firing chamber for each heater resistor, but this 
architecture also serves to fluidically isolate adjacent 
heater resistors and thereby minimize undesirable crosstalk 
therebetween. Examples of the above three sided rectangular shaped 
barrier layer geometries are those
