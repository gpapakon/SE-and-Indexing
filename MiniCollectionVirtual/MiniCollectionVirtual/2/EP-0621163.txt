<ABSTRACT>
Device for clamping a ropeway vehicle, e.g. a cab or a chair, to the conveying cable or traction cable (5) of a ropeway system, consisting of a clamping element (1) which is provided with running rollers (13) and bears a rigidly attached first clamping jaw (15) and a second clamping jaw (25) which can be pivoted with respect to the first clamping jaw (15), the second clamping jaw (25) being located at one end of a two-armed clamping lever (23) at whose other end a control element, in particular a control roller (2), which interacts with control rails, is provided, and the clamping lever (23) being pivotable with respect to the clamping element (1) counter to the effect of at least one torsion spring (3), as a result of which the second clamping jaw (25) moves in the open position. A toggle lever joint (21, 22) is provided here between the clamping lever (23) and the torsion spring (3).

<CLAIMS>
A device for coupling travelling stock, e.g. a cabin 
or a chair, to the hauling or traction cable of an aerial 

cableway installation, consisting of a clamping member 
provided with rollers and carrying a rigidly fixed first 

clamping jaw and a second clamping jaw swivellable with 
respect to the first clamping jaw, the second clamping jaw 

being located at one end of a two-armed clamping lever at the 
other end of which there is provided a control element, 

especially a control roller, interacting with control rails, 
the clamping lever being swivellable with respect to the 

clamping member against the action of at least one torsion 
spring, whereby the second clamping jaw is opened, 

characterised in that a toggle joint (21, 22) is provided 
between the clamping lever (23) and the torsion spring (3). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
first lever (21) of the toggle joint is attached to the free 

end of the at least one torsion spring (3), to which first 
lever (21) there is coupled a second lever (22) mounted on 

the clamping lever (23). 
A device according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the two levers (21, 22) of the toggle 

joint may be adjusted to an upper dead centre position. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the articulation point (21a) of the two 

levers (21, 22) of the toggle joint is located on the 
clamping lever (23) between the swivel bearing (23a) of the 

clamping lever (23) and the bearing of the second lever (22a) 
of the toggle joint, this articulation point being located,  

 
when the swivellable clamping jaw (25) is in the closed 

position, on the clamping lever (23) between the torsion 
spring (3) and the connecting line connecting the swivel 

bearing (23a) of the clamping lever (23) and the bearing 
(22a) of the second lever (22) of the toggle joint, in 

contrast to which the articulation point (21a) is located 
beyond this connecting line when the swivellable clamping jaw 

(25) is in the open position. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the articulation point (21a) of the two 

levers (21, 22) of the toggle joint is located on the 
clamping lever (23) approximately in the middle between the 

swivel bearing (23a) of the clamping lever (23) and the 
bearing (22a) of the second lever (22) of the toggle joint. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the torsion spring (3) is constructed 

as a torque rod (3) projecting from the clamping member (1) 

on both sides and to whose two free ends sleeves (32) are 
attached to which two lever arms are fixed, which two lever 

arms form the first lever (21) of the toggle joint. 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the two sleeves (32) are each rigidly connected at one end to 

the free ends of the torque rod (31) and in that the other 
ends thereof, from which the first levers (21) of the toggle 

joint project, are mounted on a bearing bush (35) fixed in 
the clamping member (1). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the clamping lever (23) is constructed 

with a clamping power testing device (7) known per se.
