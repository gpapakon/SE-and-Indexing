<ABSTRACT>
Ink particles which have been dislodged from 
wastepaper during aqueous deinking can be concentrated and 

removed from the aqueous treated fiber suspension (47) by 
the use of a magnetic field (magnets 45,46). Toner inks 

commonly used for electrostatic printing are especially 
suitable for removal by this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
Environmental conservation and a need to lower raw 
material costs have provided an increasing incentive to use 
recycled deinked fibers for a variety of paper products, 
including tissue. Of the many kinds of wastepaper available 
for recycling, paper which has been printed by 
electrostatic imaging is one of the most common sources of 
secondary fiber. In electrostatic imaging, the image is 
formed as an electrostatic pattern on the surface of a 
drum. A developer (toner) material is applied to the drum 
and selectively adheres to the charged areas. The adhered 
toner is then transferred and fixed onto the paper. Toner formulations are dependent on the type of 
imaging process that is used. Toners can be in either 
liquid or dry form and the dry toners can be further 
categorized as either monocomponent toners or dual-component 
toners. The monocomponent toners have all of the 
necessary ingredients blended together as one powder, 
whereas the dual-component toners have a separate carrier 
which is blended with the toner formulation during the 
copying process. The carrier facilitates the transport of 
the toner material through the copying process and helps 
meter the proper amount of toner material onto the imaging 
surface. Carriers can be ferrous, sand, glass or other 
material. Dry toner formulations can have some or all of the 
following ingredients: primary toner resin (also called a 
binder); secondary toner resin (waxes or polypropylene 
resins); pigment or colorant, which may be magnetic; charge 
control agent; and other specialized additives. The primary 
toner resin is a polymer that provides the bonding of the  
 
image to the paper. It has properties that allow it to 
retain an electrical charge and properly melt at a given 
temperature or flow under a given pressure. Heat or 
pressure fuses the resin and pigments together onto the 
surface of the paper. The primary toner resin comprises 
from about 35 to about 95 weight percent of the dry toner 
formulation. The secondary toner resin may comprise from 0 
to about 6 weight percent of the toner formulation. It serves to prevent fused toner particles from 
adhering to surfaces used to fix the image. Complete 
release of the image will keep all surfaces clean and 
allows the best image quality. The pigment or colorant of 
course provides the necessary color to the printed image. 
If the pigment is magnetic (ferrous), the pigment can be 
transported to the imaging drum by a magnetic brush. 
Various types of ferrous oxides are used. Recent

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing ferrous toner ink particles 
(29) from an aqueous suspension (2; 25; 47; 50) of deinked 

papermaking fibers comprising applying a magnetic field to 
the suspension which is sufficiently strong to attract and 

concentrate the toner ink particles and thereafter 
separating the concentrated toner ink particles from the 

balance of the suspension. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the suspension (2) 
flows downwardly over the surface of an inclined, moving, 

magnetized endless belt (3), wherein the toner ink 
particles are magnetically adhered to the surface of the 

belt and thereafter removed from the suspension. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the suspension is 
passed through a ferrous trap (10) containing removable 

magnets (14,15,16) and the toner ink particles are 
magnetically adhered to the surfaces of the magnets. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the suspension 
contacts the surface of a rotating drum (21), the surface 

of which is magnetized and partially immersed in the 
suspension (25), wherein the toner ink particles become 

magnetically adhered to the drum surface and are thereafter 
dislodged from the drum surface after it rotates out of the 

suspension. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the suspension (47) 
is passed through a cyclone separator (40) having a 

centrifugal outlet (42) for particles which migrate toward 
the outer wall (44) and an axial outlet (43) for particles 

which do not migrate toward the outer wall, said separator 
further having a magnetized outer wall (45,46) which 

attracts the toner ink particles and causes them to 
preferentially exit the separator through the centrifugal 

outlet (42) while the fibers preferentially exit the 
separator through the axial outlet (43). 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the magnetic field 
has a strength of about 500 Gauss or greater. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the magnetic field 
has a strength of about 7,000 Gauss or greater. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the magnetic field 
has a strength of from about 4,000 to about 20,000 Gauss. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the consistency of 
the aqueous suspension is about 2 percent or less. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the consistency of 
the aqueous suspension is about 1 percent or less. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the deinked fibers 
are chemically treated to detach and agglomerate the ink 

particles and the suspension of papermaking fibers further 
contains agglomerated ink particles. 
A centrifugal separator (40) for separating or 
concentrating ferrous solids within a fluid suspension (47) 

comprising : a conically-shaped outer wall (44) forming an 
enclosed cone having a wide end and a narrow end ; a 

tangential inlet (41) in the outer wall (44) at the wide 
end of the cone ; a centrifugal outlet (42) at the narrow 

end of the cone ; an axial outlet (43) at the wide end of 
the cone which is positioned about the axis of the cone and 

extends internally toward the narrow end of the cone ; and 
one or more magnets (44,45) which surround the conical 

outer wall (44) with a magnetic field, wherein fluid 
entering the tangential inlet (41) spirals toward the 

narrow end of the cone and flows out of the separator (40) 
through both outlets (42,43), and wherein ferrous particles 

suspended in the fluid are attracted toward the outer wall 
(44) and preferentially pass through the centrifugal outlet 

(42) at the narrow end of the cone.
