<ABSTRACT>
A safety catch comprises an elongate housing (22) having an opening (30) 
in its wall (24). A sleeve (16) is mounted on a winch cable (14) and is 

positioned in the housing (22) to define a space (23) between the sleeve 
(16) and the housing wall (24). The sleeve (14) is guidably movable along 

the housing (22). An arm (25) having a hooked end (29) is pivotally 
movable relative to the housing (22) between a normal position in which 

the hook of the arm (25) is biased to project through the opening (30), and 
a second position in which the hook (29) is retracted from the opening 

(30). Limit means in the form of a plate (19) projects from the sleeve 
(16) into the space (23) so that the plate (19) is engageable with the hook 

(29) in the normal position, to limit said movement of the sleeve. (16). 
There is no aperture in the sleeve that is capable of engaging the hook.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a safety catch for use with a winching device. In some vehicles, it is usual to support a spare wheel beneath the body of 
the vehicle. The spare wheel is held by a wheel carrying assembly, in a 
stowed position, with the tyre pressed against formations of the body. 
The assembly includes a winching device having a winch cable that holds 
the spare wheel while the cable is under tension. The winch can be 
operated by means of a detachable handle to lower the spare wheel on the 
cable to an accessible position. The device includes a pulley on which the 
cable is wound. The winching device incorporates an eccentric gear mechanism which 
provides a self-locking action, whereby a force exerted on the cable does 
not cause rotation of the pulley. The pulley should be rotatable only by 
rotation of an actuating shaft, designed to be engaged by the handle. It has been found that vibration of the vehicle, in use, sometimes causes 
the cable to unwind, so that the spare wheel comes loose. This produces 
more substantial vibration, which can lead to damage to the winching 
device, the spare wheel carrying assembly, or the spare wheel itself, and 
possibly lead to release of the spare wheel. A winching device which 
overcomes the vibration problem is disclosed in GB-A-2251589. This winching device incorporates a safety catch in order to avoid 
inadvertent lowering of the wheel carrying assembly in the event that the 
eccentric gear mechanism fails to lock. The safety catch disclosed in GB-A-2251589 comprises an elongate  
 
housing having an opening in one of its walls. A member in the form of 
a sleeve is mounted on the winch cable and is positioned in the housing 
to define a space between the sleeve and the housing, the sleeve being 
guidably movable longitudinally of the housing. An aperture is provided 
in the sleeve wall and is aligned with the opening in the housing wall 
when the winch cable is wound sufficiently for the spare wheel to be fully 
retracted under the vehicle body. An arm having a catch portion in the 
form of a hooked end is pivotally attached to the outside of the housing, 
the arm being pivotable between a normal position in which the hooked 
end is biased to project through the opening in the housing and the 
aperture in the sleeve, and a second position in which the hooked end is 
retracted from both the aperture and the opening. In order to release the safety catch disclosed in GB-A-2251589, the arm 
is pivoted against the bias into its second position while

<CLAIMS>
A safety catch for use with a winch cable (14), the safety catch 
comprising an elongate housing (22) having an opening (30) in a wall (24) 

thereof, a member (16) mountable on the winch cable (14) and positioned 
in the housing (22) to define a space (23) between the member (16) and 

the housing wall (24), the member (16) being guidably movable 
longitudinally of the housing (22), an arm (25) comprising a catch portion 

(29) and being located externally of the housing (22), the arm (25) being 
pivotally movable relative to the housing (22) between a first position in 

which the catch portion (29) is biased to project through the opening (30) 
and a second position in which the catch portion (29) i
s retracted from the 
opening (30), the member (16) having limit means (19) engageable with 

the catch portion (29), in the first position, to limit said movement of the 
member (16) in the housing (22), characterised in that there is no aperture 

in the sidewall of the member (16) capable of engaging the catch portion 
(29), and the limit means (19) comprises a projection of the member (16) 

into said space (23). 
A safety catch according to Claim 1, wherein the projection is a 
plate (19) secured to the member (16). 
A safety catch according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the projection 
(19) is cup-shaped with the opening of the cup facing the catch portion 

(29) in its normal position. 
A vehicle spare wheel winch (10) including a safety catch according 
to any preceding claim, the winch (10) comprising a winching mechanism 

(31), a winch cable (14) carrying said member (16) and a wheel bracket 
(11) carried by the member (16) and being adapted for attachment to a wheel. 
A winch according to Claim 4, comprising a casing including the 
housing (22), the arm (25) being pivotally mounted on the casing. 
A winch according to Claim 4 or 5 wherein the winch mechanism 
includes an actuating shaft (110) having a hub (100) which is engageable 

by a tool for rotation of the shaft, the arm (25) being located such that, 
when the tool engages the hub (100), the tool also engages the arm (25) 

to move the arm (25) against the bias from the first position to the second 
position. 
A winch according to Claim 6, wherein the arm (25) is pivotally 
mounted intermediate its ends (27,28) and the end part (27) of the arm 

opposite to the catch portion (29) is located for engagement by the tool to 
move the arm (25) against the bias from the first position to the second 

position.
