<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressurised mixing system which is arranged on the pressure side of an extinguishing pump and in which the foaming agent is guided under pressure via a pump to the individual mixers. The control of the pressure mixer built into every consumer can be built into a mobile or stationary fire extinguishing pump system either as an automatic mechanical or as an automatic electronic version (design). The foam mixing percentages can be set individually as required at each consumer during foaming operation in a stepless fashion from 0 to 8% in the mechanical variant, and without limitation in the electronic variant. The automatic mechanical pressure mixer operates in accordance with the differential pressure principle, but a device according to the invention ensures that this function is cancelled in the case of water operation and water can be dispensed without loss of pressure. The simultaneous dispensing of water and foam for cooling and extinguishing purposes is possible at every consumer if required, and it is possible, in addition, to set the foam mixing percentages individually. In the electronic version, a swivel device ensures that in the event of failure of the electronics each consumer can continue to maintain the mixing functions manually in emergency operation.

A foam mixing apparatus operating automatically-mechanically 
or automatically-electronically, which is 

arranged at the pump pressure side and serves for the 
admixture of a fire-fighting foam in preselected 

percentages in a mobile or stationary pumping system 
for extinguishing fire including a low-pressure pump 

(7) and possibly a high-pressure pump (17) as well as a 
further pump (26) supplying the system with foam, 


characterized in that
 the foam admixing apparatus (16, 
41) has a metering apparatus (40) and an axially 

disposed, Venturi tube-like swivel body (50) which is 
adapted to swivel into the direction in which the fire-extinguishing 

agent flows and serves for admixing foam 
supplied under pressure with the aid of the foam pump 

(26), and that, in the water mode in which no foam has 
to be supplied, the swivel body (50) is adapted to 

swivel into a position pointing counter to the 
direction in which the fire-extinguishing agent flows. 
Admixing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the metering apparatus (40) is adapted to 

swivel about a shaft (51) directed perpendicular to the 
direction in which the fire-extinguishing agent flows, 

whereby the shaft (51) is provided with an adjusting 
unit (21) and a feedthrough hole for the foam, and that 

in the foam mode, in order to generate a differential 
pressure, the swivel body (50) is adapted to swivel 

from a tubing section with an enlarged inside cross-section 
into a tubing section that adjoins the latter 

in the direction of flow and has a reduced inside 
cross-section.  

 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that in the water mode - to avoid 

pressure losses - the swivel body (50) of the metering 
apparatus (40) is adapted to swivel manually or remote-controlled 

from the tubing section of reduced cross-section. 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in the foam mode, in the 

electronic version, the swivel body (50) of the 
metering device (40) additionally takes the form of a 

differential-pressure meter in order to measure the 
total fire-fighting flow. 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that both in the mechanical and 

in the electronic version, the metering device has an 
adjusting unit (21) to adjust foam percentage 

steplessly for any foam quantities desired. 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that in the event of failure of the 

electronics, supply of foam to every item of foam-using 

equipment is provided by connecting the dual pressure 
regulator (29) and swivelling out the swivel body 

(flowmeter 52) and an individual foam percentage 
adjustment is possible. 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that an admixing apparatus (16) is 

incorporated directly in the high-pressure pump inlet 
conduit (13) and is directly connected to the foam pump 

(26), and that at the foam pump (26) a temperature  
 

measuring device and pressure gauge (30, 34) is 
provided. 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in that the foam pump (26) has an 

automatic, electric, thermal relief (31, 32, 35) as 
well as an integrated mechanical pressure relief valve 

(27) and also has an automatic electric pressure relief 
(27.1). 
An admixing apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, 
characterized in that the foam pump (26) and the high-pressure 

pump (17) are connected to the centrifugal 
fire pump by way of a hydrodynamic coupling (45) and 

are arranged in series or side by side above the 
gearbox casing and vent casing (20).
