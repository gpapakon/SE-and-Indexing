<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the
combined use of a therapeutic agent
and a determined form of hyaluronic
acid, for the manufacture of a
medicament for the topical treatment of disease
and conditions of the skin and exposed tissue. In some
embodiments this invention finds application to the treatment
of a disease or condition of the skin and exposed tissue
including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell tumours,
metastatic cancer of the breast to the skin, primary and
metastatic melanoma in the skin, malignancies and tumours in
the skin, genital warts (condyloma acuminata), cervical
cancer, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) including HPV (Human
Papilloma Virus) on the cervix, psoriasis (both plaque-type
psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis), corns on the feet, actinic
keratoses lesions, "liver" spots, fungal lesions, and other
such types of lesions, and hair loss on the head of a
pregnant women.This invention also relates to compositions and
formulations suitable for use in such treatments, the use of
such formulations in such treatments, methods of such
treatment, and the delivery of drugs for such treatments.Basal cell carcinoma is presently treated by
surgery. Each lesion, together with all surrounding and
underlying tissue (dermis, epidermis, and subdermis), is cut
out. In some instances, surgery, while necessary for the
patient's welfare, puts the patient at risk in some other
respect (for example, the removal of a lesion on a patient's
temple (resection) may jeopardize the patient's health).
Squamous cell tumours are also treated the same way as are
other forms of cancer in the skin and exposed tissue.
Furthermore, other conditions and diseases of the skin and
exposed tissue are treated in the same way or in ways that
cause discomfort to the patient, for example melanoma, genital
warts, cervical cancer, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus).Actinic keratoses lesion is dealt with similarly.
Liquid nitrogen is also used to remove the lesion.These diseases and conditions are usually found in
the epidermis (at least for the most part, extending into the
dermis and upwards through the Stratum Corneum).  Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring
glycosaminoglycan. Its molecular weight may vary from 50,000
daltons upwards, and it forms highly viscous solutions. As
regards the actual molecular weight of hyaluronic acid in
natural biological contexts, this is still a matter of much
uncertainty; when the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid is
to be determined, different values are obtained depending on
the assay method employed, and
