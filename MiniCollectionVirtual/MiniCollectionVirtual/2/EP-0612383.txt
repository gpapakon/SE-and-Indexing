<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to brakes, and more particularly to 
brake elements comprising linings secured to backing 
plates, such as brake blocks, or brake pads. A brake element according to the preamble of claim 1 is 
known for example from GB-A-1 414 915. Each of prior applications DE-A-4231549 and FR-A-2681925 
is directed to a disc brake pad having an intermediate 
layer of material, with a modulus of elasticity under 
compression of less than 1000 daN/cm , between a sole 
plate and a friction lining of a friction material with a 
modulus of elasticity under compression greater than 
11,000 daN/cm .  
 For example, a brake pad is mounted in a carrier and is 
slidable forwards and backwards along a guideway in the 
carrier into and out of a working position in which it can 
be locked, for engagement with the moving element of a 
brake system to be retarded or stopped. Such pads are used 
in rail vehicle brake systems, but are in principle usable 
elsewhere, for example in heavy goods road vehicles. When 
a lining has become worn or otherwise defective, then by 
releasing the lock the pad can be slid backwards along the 
guideway and so withdrawn from the carrier; replacement of 
a fresh pad is thus facilitated. It is an object of the present invention to provide brake 
elements comprising linings secured to backing plates, 
such as brake blocks, brake pads, and each such element 
reduces hot - spotting of and thermal damage to the 
surface of a moving element, such as a rotary element, 
which it retards or stops when engaged therewith. 
Additionally, wear of the lining itself may be reduced 
compared with known forms of such linings. According to the invention there is provided a brake 
element comprising a lining secured to a backing plate, 
wherein a layer of elastomeric material of the lining is 
relatively soft compared with a layer of friction material 
of the lining, and is interposed between the layer of 
friction material and the backing plate, the brake element 
being characterised in that the elastomeric material has a  
 
Rockwell value, as defined below, of greater than 0.30 
millimetre penetration. It may be that the improved properties resulting from this 
construction for such a brake element are a result of the 
layer of elastomeric material making the lining more 
conformable to the working surface of the moving element, 
compared with known forms of such linings, and so that the 
two surfaces engage more uniformly.  
 Preferably the elastomeric layer has a Rockwell value of 
a depth of
