<DESCRIPTION>
 ADJUSTABLE SUPPORT DEVICEThe invention relates to an adjustable support device with a body for positioning, for example a light fitting, comprising an adjustable arm supported in a tilting point, to which arm the body for positioning and a counterweight are connected on either side of the tilting point.Such a support construction is known from the German Gebrauchsmuster G 88 16 029. In the known support device a rigid arm is disposed for tilting around a shaft, which shaft is horizontally clamped between two vertically standing parts. On one side of the arm relative to the tilting point is fixed a lamp holder, on the other side a counterweight" is suspended using a cable, at a location such that both parts of the arm are in mutual equilibrium in relation to the tilting point at any possible adjusted position of the arm. With a change of the adjusted position of the arm, that is, with a change of the angle between the arm and the vertically standing parts, the horizontal distance of the counterweight to the vertically standing parts also changes. Because changing this latter distance is only possible to a limited degree, the range within which the arm can be adjusted is also limited. The object of the invention is to provide an adjustable support device not possessing this limitation.The objective is also to provide a support arm which can be embodied in light, in particular flexible, materials.This object is achieved according to the invention with a support device the counterweight of which comprises at least one holder in which at least one mass is received for free movement such that the centre of gravity of the support device and the tilting point lie on a vertical line in any position of the arm.With such a support construction it is possible to vary the angle between the adjusting arm and the normal from 0Â° to 

 In an embodiment the arm is rigid and in vertical longitudinal section the holder comprises at least partially a circular arc.In an equilibrium situation in such a support device the mass lies in the holder in the lowest point thereof. When the position of the arm is now changed, the mass moves in the holder along the arc until the lowest point is again reached and the arm is again balanced.Depending on the material used for the arm and the ratio between length and section of the arm, the arm can be considered as either rigid or flexible. It is not possible to embody a flexible arm in the known manner such that the arm is in balance at each angle of the arm to the normal. The cause of
