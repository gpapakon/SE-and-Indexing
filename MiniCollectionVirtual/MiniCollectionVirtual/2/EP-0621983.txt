<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
photovoltaic devices and more particularly to a roof or
building panel structure of the batten and seam type which
includes photovoltaic generating devices associated
therewith. Most specifically, the invention relates to
photovoltaic roofing panels which may be readily connected
and disconnected.Photovoltaic energy is becoming a very
significant source of electrical power. This is due to the
fact that problems of scarcity and safety have limited the
use of fossil and nuclear fuels and to recent advances in
photovoltaic technology which have made possible the large
scale manufacture of low cost, lightweight, thin film
photovoltaic devices. It is now possible to manufacture
large-scale, thin film silicon and/or germanium alloy
materials which manifest electrical and optical properties
equivalent, and in many instances superior, to their single
crystal counterparts. These alloys can be economically
deposited at high speed over relatively large areas and in
a variety of device configurations and they readily lend
themselves to the manufacture of low cost, large area
photovoltaic devices. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,226,898 and
5 221 364 both disclose particular thin film alloys having
utility in the manufacture of photovoltaic devices which 
may be employed in the present invention. However, it is
to be understood that the present invention is not limited
to any particular class of alloys and may be practiced
with a variety of semiconductor materials, including
crystalline, polycrystalline, microcrystalline and non-crystalline
materials.The power generated by a photovoltaic device is
proportional to the illumination incident thereupon and if
relatively large amounts of power are to be generated,
fairly large collection areas are required. The roof and
upper story areas of building structures are well
illuminated and are generally not productively used. For
some time now it has been known to place photovoltaic
collectors on the top portions of buildings since the
photovoltaic devices are advantageously positioned for
illumination; and furthermore, they can function as a
roofing structure. Roof mounted photovoltaic panels are
shown, for example, in Patent No. 4,336,413. Patent No.
4,860,509 discloses a roofing material comprised of
photovoltaic generating panels disposed in a pliant,
waterproof roofing material.Batten and seam construction is widely used in
the building of roofs and the fabrication of wall panels.
In this type of construction, a series of panels typically
