<ABSTRACT>
In a flash type EEPROM device, when a dose amount of an impurity of a 
floating gate (FG/8) is controlled, or, a channel of a transistor (4) is buried by an 

ion implantation, the threshold value at no charges accumulated is set between the 
respective thresholds corresponding to data "0" and data "1" states, to reduce the 

disturbances of a drain and a gate when reading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically erasable nonvolatile memory,
for example, a flash EEPROM or other semiconductor nonvolatile memory device,
and a method of manufacturing the same.Figure 1 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a memory cell array of a
NAND type flash EEPROM and showing the bias conditions at the time of a
reading operation.In Fig. 1, BLN-1, BLN, and BLN+1 denote bit lines, VSS denotes a source
line, WL1 to WL8 denote word lines, SG1 to SG2 denote selection gate lines,
ST1N-1, ST1N, ST1N+1, ST2N-1, ST2N, and ST2N+1 denote selection gates,
MT1N-1 to MT8N-1, MT1N to MT8N, and MT1N+1 to MT8N+1 denote
memory cell transistors, CGS denotes control gates of the memory cells, and FGS
denote floating gates of the memory cells.In the memory cell array, one end of each of the bit lines BLN-1, BLN, and
BLN+1 is connected to a common source line VSS. Between the source line Vss
and each of the other ends of the bit lines BLN-1, BLN, and BLN+1 are connected
