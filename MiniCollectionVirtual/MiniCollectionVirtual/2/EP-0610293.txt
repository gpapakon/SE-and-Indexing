 PROCESS FOR PREPARING FLUIDIZED CRACKING CATALYSTS FROM EQUILIBRIUM FLUIDIZED CRACKING CATALYSTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of fluidized cracking catalyst (FCC) containing zeolite Y in order to crack gas oils into various products, including gasoline and fuel oil, is widely practiced commercially. In catalytic cracking an inventory of particulate catalyst is continuously cycled between a cracking reactor and a catalyst regenerator. In a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) system, a stream of hydrocarbon feed is contacted with fluidized catalyst particles in the hydrocarbon cracking zone, or reactor, at a temperature of about 425°-600°C, usually 460°-560°C. The reactions of hydrocarbons at the elevated operating temperature result in deposition of carbonaceous coke on the catalyst particles. The resulting fluid products are separated from the deactivated, spent catalyst and are withdrawn from the cracking reactor. The spent catalyst particles, containing a substantial concentration of coke, are stripped of volatiles, usually by means of steam, and are then passed to the catalyst regenerator. In the regeneration zone, the coked catalyst is contacted with a predetermined amount of oxygen-containing gas. A desired portion of the coke is burned off the catalyst, simultaneously restoring catalyst activity and heating the catalyst to a higher temperature 

 required for use in the cracking zone, e.g., 540°- 815°C, usually 590°-730°C. Flue gas is formed by combustion of" he coke in the regenerator. The flue gas may be treated for removal of particulates and conversion of carbon monoxide, after which it is normally discharged into the atmosphere.The activity of a cracking catalyst is an important parameter in catalytic cracking operations. A standard measure of the activity of a cracking catalyst is the degree of conversion which can be obtained using the catalyst in a cracking operation. The degree of conversion may be defined as the volume percent of fresh hydrocarbon feed having a normal boiling point of at least 221°c which is changed to gasoline and lighter hydrocarbon products during the cracking conversion step, where the end point of gasoline for the purpose of determining conversion may be defined as 220°C. In addition to being a measure of catalyst activity, the conversion obtained with the catalyst can also be used as a measure of the severity of a cracking operation, so the activity of a catalyst is determined by conversion at a predetermined, standard set of operating conditions.
