<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stapler with a base (14), a staple magazine (22) which can be pivoted on the base (14) to a limited extend about a transverse pin (16) and an upper part (36) bearing a cap (34) or shaped like a cap which can be pivoted in relation to the staple magazine (22) and the base (14) to a limited extend about the transverse pin (16). Floating in an open-sided support (40) is an expulsion plate (32) which can be inserted into an expulsion hannel (54) of the staple magazine (22) and moved in relation to said magazine (22) in the expulsion direction by pivoting the upper part (36). On a magazine cover (31) there is a stop (46) projecting forward through an elongated hole (48) in the expulsion plate (32) parallel to the sliding direction and butting against the lower edge (50) of the elongated hole (48). In oder to secure the expulsion plate (42) in position even with the staple magazine (22) in its reloading position, the cap (34) has a frontal wall (42), the underside of which extends as far as the stop (46) and has two extensions on its inner surface laterally separated from each other and from the stop and pointing towards the forward broad side of the ejector (32) which close the gap between the frontal wall (42) and the stop (46) for the passage of the expulsion plate (2).

Stapler, having a base part (14), having a staple 
magazine (22) capable of swivelling to a limited extent 

about a transverse axis (16) in the rear region of the 
base part, having a top part (36) carrying a cap (34) or 

in the form of a cap which is capable of swivelling to a 
limited extent about the transverse axis (16) relative to 

the staple magazine (22) and the base part (14), having a 
driver plate (32) which is cradle-mounted in a mounting 

(40) of the top part (36), may be introduced into an 
ejection channel (54) of the staple magazine (22) and is 

displaceable by swivelling of the top part (36) in 
ejection direction, and having a stop lug (46) which is 

disposed on the staple magazine (22) or on a magazine 
cover (31), engages from the rear through an oblong hole 

(48) of the driver plate (32) aligned parallel to the 
direction of displacement and may, under the action of a 

spring (30) disposed between top part (36) and staple 
magazine (22) or magazine cover (31), strike against the 

bottom boundary edge (50) of the oblong hole (48), the 
free end of said stop lug projecting beyond the front 

broadside surface of the driver plate (32), 
characterized 
in that
 the cap (34) has a front wall (42), whose bottom 
edge (56) extends into the vicinity of, or frontally 

overlaps the stop lug (46) and which is provided at its 
inner surface facing the stop lug (46) with at least one 

projection (58), which is disposed in the vicinity of the 
bottom edge (56) of said front wall at a lateral distance 

from the stop lug and is directed towards the front 
broadside surface of the driver plate (32), the distance 

between the free ends, pointing in opposite directions, 
of the projection (58) and the stop lug (46) being so 

selected that no gap through which the driver plate (32) 
fits remains free. 
Stapler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
distance between the free ends, pointing in opposing 

directions, of the projection (58) and the stop lug (46)  
 

is smaller than the material thickness of the driver 
plate (32). 
Stapler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
free ends of the projection (58) and the stop lug (46) 

laterally overlap one another. 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 two projections (58) disposed at a lateral 
distance from one another on opposite sides of the stop 

lug (46) are provided on the cap front wall (42). 
Stapler according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the cradle mounting (40) of the driver plate has 
two guide gaps aligned in the top part (36) at a lateral 

distance from one another in a longitudinal direction of 
the top part for receiving, with limited longitudinal 

play, cradle arms (38) which project laterally from the 
driver plate (32), and that the cap front wall (42) has, 

on its inner side, at least two limit stops (44) which 
engage into the guide path of the guide gaps towards the 

front broadside surface of the driver plate (32).
