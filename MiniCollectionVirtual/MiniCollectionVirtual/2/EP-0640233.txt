<ABSTRACT>
In a check processing array, an imaging/illumination arrangement for illuminating and imaging checks at one or several imaging-sites as they are rapidly, continuously transported past two or more imaging stations, each station having, as its illumination source, a hollow Lambertian integrating vessel, housing lamps which project a highly uniform, diffuse Lambertian illumination-beam to its respective imaging site.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TitleELECTRONIC IMAGE SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTION:This invention relates to imaging of documents and more particularly to associated illumination operations facilitating the making of an electronic image of a document.BACKGROUND, FEATURES:Document processing is a well developed art today; for instance, witness the processing of bank checks, remittance documents and other documents of finance handled by the millions every day in banks all over the world. To handle this incredibly large volume of paper, banks rely on high speed document processors that feed thousands of 

documents per minute past various processing stations. [E.g. Unisys Corp. has DP1000, DP1800 and 9195 high speed document processors that handle 1000, 1800, and 2600 documents per minute, respectively.] Processing a bank document typically involves some or all of the following steps: e.g., document-feed, reading magnetic ink recognition characters (MICR), reading optical recognition characters (OCR), printing endorsements, microfilming, sorting/stacking (routing documents to pockets), and imaging (see Fig. IA) .The imaging task typically involves: Acquisition, processing, compression, storage, transmission, display, printing, and archive of images. This invention involves producing an image platform apt for integration with a high speed sorter for acquisition, processing, and compression; with storage retrieval modules for storage and image management; with image workstations for display; image printers for print; with optical disk subsystems for archive, and with means to transmit images, point to point, and local area networks (see Fig. IB) . Mainframe computer "hosts" can link multiple imaging document processors, and associated storage retrieval modules and other peripherals to create a large scale system (e.g. see Fig. 1C) . For image-acquisition, we prefer to use a camera which provides the system with images of the front and rear of the processed documents; e.g. facsimile images which are adequate for a customer's needs.THE PAPER MOVER: To fix the parameters of camera design, one must consider the mechanical transport that moves documents past 

the camera sensor. The document transports here contemplated can propel paper past processing stations at track speeds of 100 to 400 inches per second (ips). The 5 mil thick documents (.005") move along a track that is made 70-90 mils wide (TRACK GAP) in order to minimize jams and accommodate staples and other foreign objects that may be still attached to a document.Document size

What is Claimed is:
1. An arrangement for illuminating and imaging checks in a check-processing system wherein a large number of checks are rapidly, continuously transported past one or more imaging stations, each station having a prescribed source means comprising a Lambertian integrating cylinder which projects a highly-uniform, yet highly diffuse illumination-beam.
2. The arrangement of claim 1 wherein there are two stations each with a respective illumination beam, the two beams being balanced and matched in intensity.
3. A system for illuminating checks in a check- processing system wherein a large number of checks is rapidly transported past one or more imaging stations, each station having a prescribed respective imaging-site which is illuminated by prescribed source means which projects an illumination-beam thereto; each said source means compromising: a hollow Lambertian integrating vessel, including one or more sets of identical lamps disposed uniformly along the cylinder axis, and imaging aperture means adapted to project the energy of its said lamps to its respective said imaging-site.
4. The system of claim 3 wherein there are two said stations, each with its respective imaging site and associated illumination beam and where the two beams are "balanced" and "matched" in intensity, each being highly- diffused and highly uniform in intensity.
