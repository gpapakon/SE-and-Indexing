<ABSTRACT>
A photodiode structure for the detection of radiation comprises a 
semiconductor base layer (12') of p-type conductivity with a high doping 

density, an epitaxial layer (11') of p-type conductivity with a 
relatively low doping density, areas (10',20) of n-type conductivity and 

oxide layers (9') covering the areas of n-type conductivity. The oxide 
layers comprise doping impurities of the same conductivity type as the 

areas below them. The doping density in the areas of n-type conductivity 
decrease towards the junction with the epitaxial layer. Due to this 

decrease in doping density, an electric field gradient is produced which 
guides the charge carriers to the junction. The generation of a field 

gradient and the creation of a surface charge result in an improved 
quantum efficiency. The invention is preferably used in photodiode 

arrays. Due to the gradient in doping density in the epitaxial layer 
(11'), charge carriers are reflected at the interface between the layers 

(11') and (12') so that cross talk between adjacent diodes (10',20) in a 
photodiode array is reduced. According to a preferred method for 

manufacturing a photodiode structure of the invention, the doping of the 
photodiode structures (10',20) is performed by ion implantation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a photodiode structure for the detection of radiation and
a method for manufacturing such a structure. Such photodiode structures are
used, for example, in sensors and detection instruments. Several photodiode
structures can be arranged in a line on a semiconductor chip, forming a
photodiode array. Photodiode arrays are typically used in spectrophotometers.A photodiode structure of the mentioned type is known from US-A- 4,107,722.
This known photodiode structure comprises a silicon substrate of p-type
conductivity, a first layer of n-type conductivity having a relatively low doping
density which is arranged on the substrate, a second layer of n-type conductivity
arranged on the first layer and having a higher doping density than the first
layer, and a layer of silicon dioxide arranged on the second layer. The
photodiode structure is used for image detectors and scanners and is
characterized by an enhanced blue color light response.Conventional photodiode structures are prone to some deficiencies which will
subsequently be explained with reference to Figure 1. Figure 1 illustrates the
general principle of photo conductive detection with silicon diodes. The
photodiode comprises an insulating layer 8, a first semiconductor layer 3 of a
first conductivity type and a second semiconductor layer 4 of a second
conductivity type. The photons 5 are absorbed in the silicon generating a charge 
pair 6. In impurity doped devices, only the minority carriers in the given layer need to be
considered for the model. The generated charge is detected (via connectors 1a and 1b)
as the minority carrier is able to diffuse to and cross the junction of the diode. A
competitive process is the recombination of the minority carrier at defect centers 7. This
process reduces the quantum efficiency. The defect center concentration is very high at
the surface and is usually increasing with high doping and bad lattice match of the
dopant.The absorption is very low in the infrared spectral region. The minority carriers are
generated deeply in the silicon. The diffusion length to the junction is long and the limited
lifetime due to active defect centers reduces the quantum efficiency. In photodiode arrays,
a long lifetime and diffusion length leads to cross talk between adjacent diodes.In contrast to the infrared spectral region, the absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) region is
very high. The minority carriers are generated very close to the surface of the device. The
high photon energy generates defects and
