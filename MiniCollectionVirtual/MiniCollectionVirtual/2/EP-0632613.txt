<ABSTRACT>
A radio communication system receiver employs a 
demodulator (104) to recover a received signal. The 

receiver of the present invention further includes a 
channel quality estimator (222) for estimating a 

characteristic of the communication channel over which 
the signal is received. A first or second decoding 

technique (220) is selectively employed using the 
estimated communication channel quality value (223). In 

this manner, an improved receiver is provided that is able 
to realize the benefits of either the first or the second 

decoding technique, depending on the channel condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radio 
communication systems, and in particular to such systems 
that provide error protection in the transmitted data to 
facilitate improved bit error rate (BER) performance 
during recovery of the transmitted data. Voice communication systems are well known in the 
art. Pursuant to many such systems, an information 
signal--which may comprise a plurality of discrete data 
elements--is modulated onto a carrier signal and 
transmitted from a first location to a second location. At 
the second location, the information signal is demodulated 
and recovered. One of the goals of such communication 
systems is to place a high number of voice channels within 
a given radio frequency (RF) channel bandwidth while 
maintaining acceptable speech quality. In a digital radio communication system, an input 
speech waveform is sampled, encoded, and transmitted 
through a digital radio communication channel. To achieve 
higher spectrum efficiency, the input speech is preferably 
coded into the lowest possible bit rate while still 
maintaining acceptable speech quality. It is generally 
known that speech quality is determined, at least in part, 
by the bit error sensitivity of the coded speech bits. When 
input speech is coded at lower bit rates for higher 
spectral efficiency, recovered speech quality is highly 
sensitive to bit errors in some of the encoded bits.  
 
Further, bits generated by speech coding (e.g., vector sum 
excited linear prediction, or VSELP) have the 
characteristic of non-uniform sensitivity to errors. 
Expressed another way, some bits in the data stream are 
more important (i.e., as compared to other bits in the same 
data stream) to the resultant speech quality, and are 
therefore considered more sensitive than those other bits. In a typical voice communication system, the input 
analog speech is first encoded using a known low bit rate 
source coding technique (e.g. VSELP). The resultant data 
elements (typically bits) are then typically channel coded 
prior to transmission. Channel coding consists of adding 
additional information content to the data elements 
produced by the source coder to provide a certain degree of 
immunity to errors. In order to preserve spectral 
efficiency, it is desirable to minimize this added overhead 
as much as possible, while still providing adequate error 
protection. Channel coding typically involves a 
partitioning of the input data into two or more groups 
based on their sensitivity, which characteristic is 
descri
