<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal 
emulsifiable suspension concentrate composition comprising 

about 5% to 20% by weight of a 
imidazolinyl benzoic acid, or ester or salt thereof, 

and about 10% to 30% by weight of a 
dinitroaniline herbicide, 

either about 2% to 10% by weight of an alkylarylsulfonate and about 0.5% 
to 10% by weight of an antigelation agent or about 0.5% to 10% by 

weight of a mixture of an 
alkylarylsulfonate and an alkylarylsulfonic acid, 

about 5% to 15% by weight of a nonionic 
surfactant or mixture of nonionic surfactants, about 1% to 10% by weight 

of a suspending agent, up to about 1% by weight of an antifoaming agent, 
and an organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents.

<DESCRIPTION>
Combination products containing imidazolinyl
benzoic acids, or esters or salts thereof, such as
imazamethabenz-methyl (an isomeric mixture of methyl 6-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-m-toluate
and methyl 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-p-toluate),
and dinitroaniline
herbicides, such as pendimethalin (N-(1-ethylpropyl)-2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine),
trifluralin (N,N-dipropyl-2,6-dinitro-4-trifluoromethylaniline)
and the like, are
effective herbicidal agents. However, it has been
found that those combination products exhibit poor low
temperature stability. Those products tend to thicken
on storage at low temperatures and solid product
remains in the container after use.The present invention overcomes the drawbacks
of the prior art by providing a herbicidal emulsifiable
suspension concentrate composition which exhibits low
temperature stability. Such stable compositions also
have desirable flow characteristics. It is an object of the present invention,
therefore, to provide an emulsifiable suspension
concentrate composition of imidazolinyl benzoic acids,
or esters or salts thereof, and dinitroaniline
herbicides, which is stable at low temperatures.The present invention relates to a herbicidal
emulsifiable suspension concentrate composition
comprising either 5% to 20% by weight of a
imdazolinyl benzoic acid, or ester or salt thereof, and
10% to 30% by weight of a dinitroaniline
herbicide, either 2% to 10% by weight of an
alkylarylsulfonate and 0.5% to 10% by weight of
an antigelation agent or 0.5% to 10% by weight of
a mixture of an alkylarylsulfonate and an
alkylarylsulfonic acid, 5% to 15% by weight of a
nonionic surfactant or mixture of nonionic surfactants,
1% to 10% by weight of a suspending agent, up to
1% by weight of an antifoaming agent, and an
organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents.It has been found that combinations of
herbicidal imidazolinyl benzoic acids, or esters or
salts thereof, and dinitroaniline emulsifiable
suspension concentrate compositions thicken on storage
at low temperatures and that large amounts of product
are left in the container after the contents are poured
out. Since those compositions may be used in areas
where low
temperature prevails, emulsifiable suspension
concentrate
compositions with low temperature stability are
required. Surprisingly, it has now been discovered
that the herbicidal emulsifiable suspension concentrate
compositions of the present invention remain free-flowing
at low temperatures and do not leave any
significant
