<ABSTRACT>
Azlactone-functional substrates (especially hydrogels), mammalian body implants, and methods of making and using them are disclosed. The azlactone-functional substrates are the reaction product of substrates having azlactone-reactive nucleophilic surfaces and a multi-functional azlactone composition having at least two azlactone moieties, where at least one moiety covalently couples to the azlactone-reactive nucleophilic surface and at least one moiety remains available for further nucleophilic reaction, such as with a biologically active material. A preferred use of azlactone-functional hydrogel is as the optical element of a corneal prosthesis which enhances epithethial cell growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substrates, especially hydrogels,
having azlactone-functional surfaces, mammalian body implants, (e.g.,
corneal prostheses), comprising such azlactone-functional hydrogels,
and methods of making and using them.Mammalian body implants, such as corneal prostheses, (also
known as keratoprostheses), are very useful to replace degenerated or
injured mammalian tissue if the remainder of the mammalian body accepts
the presence of such implant and if the biocompatible implant performs
the function of the replaced tissue in an acceptable manner.Corneal prostheses are especially vital for the continued
functioning of a mammal, especially a human being, because a
degenerated or injured cornea obscures vision.While there have been attempts to provide synthetic corneal
prostheses, currently none are deemed acceptable by governmental
regulatory agencies due to their inability to provide an acceptable
replacement for natural cornea transplants obtained from cadavers.
Often these devices have failed because of erosion and necrosis of the
adjacent tissue, chronic inflammation and epithelialization of the
anterior chamber.Optimally, the anterior surface of a keratoprosthesis
should support the adherence and proliferation of corneal epithelial
cells, resulting in an intact epithelial layer which is continuous with
the surrounding host epithelium. A continuous layer of epithelium
permits maintenance of the normal precorneal tear film, ensures a good
optical surface and provides a barrier against microbial invasion.A prior effort has been to provide a corneal prosthesis
using poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel as an optical element and a porous
outer skirt secured to the periphery of the element. European Patent
Publication 0 333 344 (Capecchi et al.), the European counterpart to
U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,428 discloses this corneal prosthesis and
identifies the desire to coat or laminate the anterior surface with a
basement membrane component(s) to facilitate growth of epithelial cells
on it. Coating is preferably performed by adsorption or chemical
attachment or integration during polymerization with basement membrane
component(s) prior to seeding of corneal epithelial cells on the
anterior surface. Acceptable basement membrane components include
laminin, fibronectin, Type I collagen, Type IV collagen, or a cell-free
extract prepared from extracellular matrix of corneal epithelial cells. The need exists to optimize interaction of cells with
mammalian body implants. The present invention solves the problem of
p
