<ABSTRACT>
An electronic audible warning device (10), which includes a power source (18), a motion detector (401), a pleasant tone generator (100, Q1, Q3), a loud piercing tone generator (100, Q1, Q2) and a remote push button activation switch (19) is disclosed. Signaling device (10) provides two distinct features, each responsive to remote activation switch (19). A single depression on push button switch (19) will sound an unobtrusive, pleasant sounding two second pulsating warning tone. Two consecutive pushes on push button (19) will sound an attention-getting pulsating signal, similar to the backup beeper on commercial trucks, which will continue to sound until button (19) is pressed again. An additional feature is provided which is responsive to a motion detector (401). Here, a loud, piercing tone is sounded whenever a bicycle (1) or similarly attached article is moved. The alarm is activated and deactivated via an electrical key switch (402) which is installed directly in main housing (11).

TITLE OF INVENTION;ELECTRONIC SIGNALING DEVICE FOR BICYCLES AND THE LIKED E S C R I P T I O NBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field. This invention generally relates to audible warning devices for bicyclers, roller skaters, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an electronic audible warning device which also has a motion detection and actuation means to provide for a theft warning device. Background Art. Bicyclists have long recognized the need to warn others that a bicycle is approaching. Forced air horns, bells and the like have been around almost as long as bicycles themselves. A resurgence of physical activity such as bicycling, skiing and roller skating has amplified the need to warn others that a sport enthusiast is guickly approaching, especially from behind.The problem is even more critical with the nationwide trend of developing bicycle and walking paths through quiet areas. As a result of the increasing popularity of these paths, they have become quite crowded and can be hazardous. Typically, cycling and skating are fairly non- intrusive forms of recreation and a person on a path is often unaware that someone else is 'quickly approaching from behind. As a result, the person who is attempting to overtake the slower person will often yell or honk their horn, both of which sounds disturb the natural serenity of the surroundings and startle the other path user, some¬ times doing more harm than good. Most of the time cy- 

clists on bike paths and other non-motorized recreation corridors do not need to sound an excessively loud and startling signal to alert other users. However, in urban settings with lots of loud vehicular traffic, a piercing signal becomes necessary.Without the use of these warnings, the courteous cyclist is forced to slow down to the speed of the person whom they are trying to pass. However, even this places the slower person on the path in a precarious position and sometimes startled state of mind, as he or she will not learn of the passing cyclist until the last possible moment and will make a split-second decision on whether to move to the right or to the left. Unfortunately, the cyclist also makes a last-second decision, waiting for the slower person to commit, often resulting in both people moving in the same direction and colliding.An additional problem with bicycles addressed by this invention is that bicycles are susceptible to tampering and theft. Frequently, they are left locked to a bicycle rack unattended for extended periods of time, and

 1. An electronic warning device for use in recre¬ ational activities which is characterized by: a momentary push button switch; first electronic sound generation means being respon- sive to a single depression of said push button switch and configured to produce a pleasant non-alarming sound of limited duration to warn others of an approaching person; second electronic sound generation means being respon¬ sive to a two consecutive depressions of said push button switch and configured to produce a loud piercing continu¬ ous tone to immediately alert others of an approaching person; sound deactivation means being electrically connected to said second sound generation means and responsive to an additional depression following the two consecutive de¬ pressions of said push button switch and configured to deactivate said second sound generation means; and power supply means being electrically connected to said first and second sound generation means and to said sound deactivation means for providing power to the same.
2. The warning device of Claim 1 further character¬ ized by: motion detection means being electrically connected to said second sound generation means and configured to activate said second sound generation means in response to movement of the detection means; and a key switch being electrically connected to said motion detection means for selectively activating said motion detection means. 


 3. The warning device of Claim 1 wherein said power supply means is characterized by: a rechargeable battery; and a solar cell being electrically connected to said re- chargeable battery for charging the same in response to sunlight received by said solar cell.
4. The warning device of Claim 1 wherein said first electronic sound generation means is also responsive to a four consecutive depressions of said push button switch and configured to produce a pleasant, non-alarming sound of limited duration which continues and repeats to sound periodically; and said sound deactivation means is also electrically connected to said first sound generation means and respon¬ sive to an additional depression following the four con¬ secutive depressions of said push button switch and con¬ figured to deactivate said first sound generation means. 

5. The warning device of Claim 1 wherein the first sound generation means, the second sound generation means and the sound deactivation means are characterized by: a microprocessor having an input responsive to said push button switch and a ROM configured to selectively produce at an output on said microprocessor either a first signal of limited duration or a second signal of continu¬ ous duration, both dependent upon input received from said push button switch, said ROM further being configured to selectively deactivate said second signal dependent upon input received from said push button switch; and a sound transducer being electrically connected to said output on said microprocessor and further configured to produce a pleasant sound of limited duration upon receiving said first signal and a loud piercing continuous sound upon receiving said second signal.
