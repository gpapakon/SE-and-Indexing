<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods for use in modulating neurotrophin activity, wherein the active agent is at least one compound which potentiates neurotrophin activity. A preferred class of active agents is K-252 compounds, including both microbial metabolites and derivatives thereof. Neurotrophin activity is modulated by administration of an effective amount of at least one compound which potentiates neurotrophin activity. Potentiation of NT-3 by K-252b, K-252a, KT5720, and KT5823 provides a model for therapeutic intervention in a variety of neuropathological conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING K-252 COMPOUNDS FOR POTENTIATION OF NEUROTROPHIN ACTIVITYBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to compositions which are useful in potentiating neurotrophin activity, as well as methods for the preparation and use thereof.Protein growth factors of the neurotrophin family, which includes nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) and neurotrophin-5 (NT-5) regulate nervous system development [Barde, Y-A., Trophic factors and neuronal survival," Neuron 2:1525-1534 (1989); Thoenen, H., "The changing scene of neurotrophic factors," Trends NeuroscL 74:165-170 (1991); Leibrock, J. et al., "Molecular cloning and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor," Nature 341:149-152 (1989); Ernfors, P. et al., "Identification of cells in rat brain and peripheral tissues expressing mRNA for members of the nerve growth factor family," Neuron 5:511-526 (1990); Hohn, A. et al., "Identification and characterization of a novel member of the nerve growth factor/brain-derived neurotrophic factor family," Nature 344:339-341 (1990); Maisonpierre, P.C. et al., "Neurotrophin-3: a neurotrophic factor related to NGF and BDNF," Science 247:1446-1451 (1990);Rosenthal, A. et al., "Primary Structure and Biological Activity of a Novel Human Neurotrophic Factor," Neuron 4:761-773 (1990); Jones, K.R. and Reichardt, L.F., "Molecular cloning of a human gene that is a member of the nerve growth factor family", Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 87:8060-8064 (1990); Hallbook, F. et al., "Evolutionary studies on the nerve growth factor family reveal a novel member abundantly expressed in Xenopus ovary," Neuron 6:845-858 (1991); Berkemeier, L.R. et al., "Neurotrophin-5: a novel neurotrophic factor that activates trk and trkB," Neuron (in press)]. In addition, the neurotrophins are strongly implicated1SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 as playing an important role in structural maintenance, plasticity and repair of the adult nervous system [Hefti, F. et al., "Function of neurotrophic factors in the adult and aging brain and their possible use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases," Neurobiol Aging 20:515-533 (1989)]. Neurobiological research carried out in recent years has confirmed that development, maintenance of function and regeneration of neurons is profoundly influenced by the neurotrophic factors. These neurotrophins stimulate mechanisms necessary for survival, neurite growth and functions related to transmitter production and release.
