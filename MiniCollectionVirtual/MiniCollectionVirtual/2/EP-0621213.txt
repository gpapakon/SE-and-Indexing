<ABSTRACT>
The cellar tank, in particular made of plastics, is provided to receive liquid fuels. It comprises a container (1) which can be folded together and consists essentially of flexible film material which is weldable and/or bondable and is reinforced, for example, with glass or textile fibres. Said container is assigned a dimensionally stable bearing structure which is to be set up at the site of use. In this case, the container (1) is attached suspended on the bearing structure by holding means (10, 11, 25, 27, 28). Furthermore, the tank has a manhole-like lid (18) which is arranged above the filling level and is provided with connections (21, 22) to ensure the supply and removal of fuel as well as the venting and aeration of the tank and its internal cleaning. A cellar tank is thus provided, which can be installed or replaced with simple handling and without particular expense even in restricted spaces, and which is also accessible for internal cleaning and safe inlet and outlet.

Fuel cellar-tank for liquid fuels consisting of 
synthetic material, comprising a foldable container (1) 

with which is associated a supporting structure (30) of 
stable shape to be erected at the place of use, the 

container, consisting of an essentially flexible, 
weldable and/or bondable sheet material, being capable 

of being fastened in hanging relationship to the 
supporting structure by means of holding means arranged 

on it, the tank comprising a manhole-like cover (18) 
which is arranged above the liquid surface in the filled 

state, characterized in that the sheet material is 
reinforced for example with glass or textile fibers and 

the container, with the exception of the manhole, is 
made with multiple walls, the cover (18) comprising 

connection fittings (21, 22) for ensuring the supply and 
the taking of fuel as well as the de-aeration and the 

ventilation of the tank and the inside cleaning thereof. 
Cellar-tank according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a supporting frame with two supporting longitudinal 

members (10) and two supporting cross members (11) for 
the formation of contours corresponding to the manhole 

(4) is provided on the supporting structure for 
receiving a rigid manhole cover. 
Cellar-tank according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the container may be electrically 

earthed. 
Fuel cellar-tank according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the container consists of an outer 

envelope and of a bag-like structure interchangeably 
inserted into the outer envelope.  

 
Fuel cellar-tank according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the holding means are constituted 

by eyelets, hooks or passageways for supporting bars. 
Fuel cellar-tank according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the supporting structure is made 

in the shape of a framework and comprises retaining 
means, for example hooks, eyelets or supporting bars co-operating 

with the holding means of the container.
