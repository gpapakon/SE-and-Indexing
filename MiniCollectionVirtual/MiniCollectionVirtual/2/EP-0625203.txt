<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF INVENTION SYNTHETIC HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE CONJUGATE VACCINEFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to synthetic vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) infection. In particular, the invention relates to the use of potent T- helper cell determinants (THDs) and B-cell epitopes (BEs) of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) PI, P2 and P6 of Hi, covalently linked to synthetic oligosaccharides containing repeating units of polyribosylribitol phosphate (sPRP) to form immunogenic synthetic PRP- peptide conjugate vaccines that can elicit high titers of anti-PRP and anti-OMP antibodies in mammals. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a major cause of bacterial meningitis in children under five years of age (refs. 1, 2) . The literature references are identified at the end of this disclosure) . The bacterium is protected from phagocytosis by a polysaccharide capsule that is a repeating polymer of polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) . Antibodies induced against the capsular polysaccharide of the organism are protective (ref. 3). Effective conjugate vaccines in which PRP is linked to different carrier proteins such as diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D) , tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) , CRM 197 (HbOC) and the outer membrane protein of Neisseria menincritidis have been developed (refs. 4, 5). However, these conjugate vaccines do not protect against other invasive encapsulated H. influenzae type a and c strains and, more importantly, against non-encapsulated non-typeable H. influenzae strains that are one of the common causes of otitis media for which there is no vaccine. Therefore, the inclusion of selected non-encapsulated H. influenzae immunogens in current Hib vaccines is necessary to develop a universal Hi vaccine. 

 2 Granoff and Munson (ref. 6) have reported that antibodies directed against Hib outer membrane proteins (OMP) PI, P2 and P6 were protective in the infant rat model of bacteremia. Therefore, a promising strategy for designing a universal H. influenzae vaccine with enhanced protective ability would be to use either purified OMPs or their protective epitopes as additional immunogens and carriers for PRP. The gene coding for PI has been cloned from several different Hib subtypes (refs. 7, 8). The comparative analysis of PI protein sequences from these Hib isolates revealed the existence of three hypervariable regions. Indeed, the Pl-specific MAbs reported by Hansen's group recognize only 50% of the Hib isolates tested (refs. 7, 9). For the P2 protein, although the
