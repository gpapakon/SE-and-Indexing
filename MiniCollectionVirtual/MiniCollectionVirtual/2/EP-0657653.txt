(33) disposed radially inwardly of the motor stator (32) and in which a 

fluid passage of a main flow of a pumped fluid is defined, a 
rotatable shaft (41), a motor rotor (42) fixedly supported on an end of 

the rotatable shaft (41) and disposed radially inwardly of the 
stator can (33), a pump impeller (48) mounted on an opposite end of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a canned motor pump,
and more particularly to a canned motor pump of relative small
size and low output power for use in, for example, circulating
warm water.There has been known a canned motor pump in which a
main fluid stream flows radially inwardly of the stator of an
electric motor. One example of such a canned motor pump is
disclosed in Japanese utility model publication No. 57-10205.
FIG. 17 of the accompanying drawings shows the disclosed canned
motor pump. As shown in FIG. 17, the canned motor pump has a
frame 10 and side covers 11, 12 mounted respectively on
opposite ends of the frame 10 and having respective inlet and
outlet ports 11', 12' defined therein. The canned motor pump
also has a motor shaft 13 rotatably supported horizontally in
the frame 10 by two axially spaced bearings 14, and an impeller
15 fixed to one end of the motor shaft 13 so that the impeller
15 can be rotated when the motor shaft 13 is rotated about its
own axis.The bearings 14 are fixedly mounted on a bearing
holder 26 and the side cover 12, respectively. The motor shaft
13 can be rotated by a rotor 16 which is fixedly disposed
around the motor shaft 13 and supported thereon by a support
17. The rotor 16 and the support 17 are immersed in a fluid
that is fed by the canned motor pump. The canned motor pump 
also includes a stator 18 disposed between the rotor 16 and the
frame 10 in radially confronting relation to the rotor 16. The
stator 18 is completely isolated from the fluid by a can 19 of
stainless steel that is positioned in the radial gap between
the rotor 16 and the stator 18.Can plates 20 are joined at a substantially right
angle to the respective opposite ends of the can 19. The can
plates 20 and the can 19 jointly seal the stator 18 within the
frame 10.Other canned motor pumps in which a main fluid stream
flows radially inwardly of the stator of an electric motor are
also disclosed in Japanese laid-open utility model publication
No. 48-83402 and Japanese utility model publication No. 62-8397.
For reducing a loss of the main fluid stream, the canned
motor pump has a simple axial-flow impeller installed as
disclosed in the former publication or a spiral rotor column as
disclosed in the latter publication.The conventional canned motor pump shown in FIG. 20
has suffered the following problems:The bearings 14 cannot fully be kept concentrically
with each other. Specifically, the bearings 14 are fixedly
mounted on the bearing holder 26 and the side cover 12,
respectively, which are
