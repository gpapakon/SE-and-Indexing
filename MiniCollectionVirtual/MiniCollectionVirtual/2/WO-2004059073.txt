<DESCRIPTION>
 AQUEOUS COMPOSITION FOR RENDERING FIBROUS SUBSTRATES WATER REPELLENTField of the inventionThis invention relates to aqueous compositions for rendering fibrous substrates water repellent. In a particular aspect, this invention relates to such compositions that are substantially free of fluorochemical compounds.Background of the inventionCompositions for making substrates and in particular fibrous substrates such as textiles, water repellent have been long known in the art. Generally, the commercially available compositions to render textiles water repellent comprise a fluorochemical compound, i.e., a compound that comprises substantial amounts of fluorine. Such fluorochemical compounds can be simple low molecular weight compounds as well as oligomeric or polymeric compounds.For example, US 3,480,579 discloses compositions that are based on a mixture of a hydrocarbon derivatised melamine and a fluorochemical compound to render, for example, textiles water and oil repellent. The compositions of US 3,480,579 may further contain a wax such as a paraffin wax. US 4,477,498 and US 4,014,857 each disclose melamines that have been derivatised with a fluorochemical group to render substrates oil and water repellent. WO 98/45345 discloses melamines that have been derivatised with hydrocarbon groups as well as fluorochemical groups. These compositions are taught for treating textiles and to render same oil and water repellent.From US 4,834,764 and WO 99/14422 there are further known compositions for making textile oil and water repellent which are based on a blocked isocyanate component and a fluorochemical compound. Similarly, US 5,508,370 teaches blocked isocyanates that are self-emulsifying in water. These blocked isocyanates may be used to render substrates such as textiles water repellent and are generally taught for use in combination with fluorochemical compounds. 

Thanks to the use of fluorochemical compounds in such compositions, excellent oil and water repellent properties can be imparted on a substrate. Unfortunately, environmental concerns have recently been raised with respect to their use. Therefore, a need exists to find alternative compositions that are substantially free of fluorochemical compounds and that nevertheless still yield good water repellent properties on a substrate, in particular textile.Although commercial water repellent compositions are generally based on one or more fluorochemical compound, there are also water repellent compositions known that are free of such compounds.
