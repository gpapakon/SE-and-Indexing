<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a compact electric motor, in particular one which is compact in the longitudinal direction, to one end of which a driven unit (2), in particular a hydraulic ABS pump, is flange-fitted. To ensure that such a motor is simple to manufacture, the invention calls for the following measures: a) formed in the floor of the cup-type housing (1) by non-cutting techniques is a journal (1.1) projecting axially outwards, b) the journal (1.1) has a bearing seat, formed radially inside it by non-cutting techniques, for the rotor shaft (4) of the electric motor, c) the journal (1.1) has an attachment mounting formed radially outside it by non-cutting techniques for the driven unit (2).

Electric motor with a deep-drawn, cup-type 
housing (1) for driving an assembly (2), especially a 

hydraulic pump of an anti-lock braking system, which can 
be flange-mounted onto the front side of the motor 

housing (1), having the following features: 

a) into the base of the cup-shaped motor housing (1) 
there is formed in by deep-drawing, in a non-cutting 

procedure, a bearing journal (1.1) which 
protrudes axially outwards; 
b) the bearing journal (1.1) is provided radially on 
the inside with a mounting fixture for the rotor 

shaft (4) of the electric motor, which mounting 
fixture is formed in by deep-drawing, in a non-cutting 

procedure; 
c) the bearing journal (1.1) is provided radially on 
the outside with a fastening fixture for the assembly 

(2), which fastening fixture is formed in by 
deep-drawing, in a non-cutting procedure; 
d) the bearing journal (1.1) is divided axially in 
step-shaped arrangement into at least two regions 

(1.11, 1.12) of different radially inner and 
radially outer diameters, of which the one radially 

smaller and axially outer region (1.11) is intended 
for the radially inner mounting fixture of the rotor 

shaft (4) and the other radially larger and axially 
inner region (1.12) is intended for the radially 

outer fastening fixture of the assembly (2). 
Electric motor according to Claim 1, having the 
feature:
  
 

   e) the radial widths of the one region (1.11) and of 
the other region (1.12) are defined according to the 

corresponding radial widths of an axially insertable 
bearing (4.3) for the rotor shaft (4) and of an 

axially mountable flange opening (2.1) of the assembly 
(2) respectively. 
Electric motor according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, having the feature:
 
   f) the radial widths of the one region (1.11) and of 

the other region (1.12) are defined with due regard 
to the production and material tolerances such that, 

in a calibration-finishing of the respective one 
receiving seat, the receiving region of the respective 

other receiving seat remains free from wall 
parts of the bearing journal (1.1), the said wall 

parts being forced away radially inwards or radially 
outwards. 
Electric motor according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, having the feature:
 
   g) onto the cup-type motor housing (1) there is slid, 

from its cup-rim side, a cup-shaped insulating cover 
cap (3), such that a seal is formed for the purpose 

of sealing off the motor housing (1) also on its 
side facing away from the cup-shaped base. 
Electric motor, especially a commutator motor, 
according to Claim 4, having the feature:
 
   h) in the insulating cover cap (3), a connecting line 

(9) for the rotor winding is guided from that end of 
the motor housing (1) facing away from the cup-shaped 

base, especially located on the commutator 
side, to that end of the motor housing (1) located 

on the cup-shaped base side. 
Electric motor according to Claim 5, having the 
feature:
 
   i) into the outer contacting face of the insulating 

cover cap (3) there is provided a tunnel-like cable 
duct (3.1) for a connecting line (9) inserted therein 

in seal-forming arrangement (seal 9.2).  
 
Electric motor according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, having the feature:
 
   j) at that end of the motor housing (1) facing away 

from the cup-shaped base there is provided a further 
mounting fixture (bearing bracket 2), which is 

simultaneously configured as a brush-holder device 
for a commutator motor, in particular caulked with 

the motor housing (1).
