<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a polymeric thermo-optic device comprising a 
polymeric optical waveguide and a heating element, the polymeric 
waveguide having a layered structure comprising a polymeric guiding 
layer (core layer) sandwiched between two layers having a refractive 
index lower than that of the guiding layer (cladding layers). Thermo-optic devices are known, e.g. from the description given by 
Diemeer et al. in Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol.7, No.3 (1989), 
pp 449-453. Their working is generally based on the phenomenon of the 
optical waveguide material employed exhibiting a temperature dependent 
refractive index (polarization independent thermo-optic effect). Such 
devices have been realised, int.al., in inorganic materials such as 
ion-exchanged glass and titanium-doped lithium niobate. The use of 
all-polymeric waveguides for thermo-optic devices has also been 
disclosed, an advantage thereof described by Diemeer et al. being that 
a modest increase in temperature may result in a large index of 
refraction change. The device described by Diemeer is an all-polymeric 
planar switch. Switching is achieved by employing total internal 
reflection from a thermally induced index barrier. The device 
comprises a substrate (PMMA), a guiding layer (polyurethane varnish), 
and a buffer layer (PMMA), with the heating element being a silver 
stripe heater deposited by evaporation upon the buffer layer through a 
mechanical mask. A typical switching speed disclosed is 12 ms for 
changing from the deflected state (on state) to the transmitted state 
(off state), and 60 ms for changing from transmission to deflection. A thermo-optic switching device has also been disclosed by MÃ¶hlmann et 
al. in SPIE Vol. 1560 Nonlinear Optical Properties of Organic 
Materials IV (1991) pp 426-433. Use is made of a polymer in which a 
waveguide channel can be created through irradiation. The disclosed 
device is a polarisation/wavelength insensitive polymeric switch  
 
comprising an asymmetric Y-junction. The switching properties are 
based on heat-induced refractive index modulations causing variations 
in the mode evolution in such asymmetric Y-junctions. The device 
comprises a glass substrate and a polymeric multilayer comprising an 
NLO polymer. The multi layer structure is not specifically shown. The 
disclosed switching time is of the order of milliseconds. The 
disclosure refers to devices that are attractive in those locations of 
the network where slower switches are permitted. Another thermo-optic
