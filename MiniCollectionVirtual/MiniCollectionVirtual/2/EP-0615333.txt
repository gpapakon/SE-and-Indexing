<ABSTRACT>
The rotary electrical component 30 has first and second 
windings 20, 22 thereon and the connector 30 comprises a 

body 32 having first and second spaced apart sections 
33,34 which receive respective ends 20a, 22a of the 

windings 20, 22 to be interconnected. An electrically 
conductive element 46 extends between the two sections 

33, 34 for connection to the winding ends 20a, 22a. The 
sections 33, 34 include supports 42 for resisting outward 

movement of the winding ends 20a, 22a due to centrifugal 
force so as to reduce the likelihood of disconnection 

between the winding ends 20a, 22a and the conductive 
element 46.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a winding connector for a rotary 
electrical component, for example, a rotor of a brushless 
generator. The invention is primarily concerned with a connector for 
windings in a two-pole aircraft electric generator of the 
kind which is designed to run at 24,000 rpm (to provide 
400Hz). With such a two-pole generator, the rotor normally 
includes a core which is of generally I-shaped cross 
section to provide two salient poles around which two 
windings are wound. The windings are connected in series 
and, in order to do that, a free end of one of the 
windings at one end of the core is connected (typically 
brazed) to a free end of the other winding at the same 
end of the core. The high rotary speeds at which such 
generators normally run subject the brazed joint between 
the windings to high centrifugal loading which increases 
the possibility of fracture of the joint. Also, where 
the winding wire has been stressed by bending to 
facilitate making the joint, it is stressed still further 
by the centrifugal force. The repair of a fractured 
joint is very difficult since generally the broken 
winding ends are too short to rejoin readily. The 
dismantling and re-assembly of the aircraft generator is  
 
time consuming and expensive and an object of the present 
invention is to provide an improved form of connection 
between coil windings. According to the invention there is provided a winding 
connector for a rotary electrical component having first 
and second windings thereon, the connector for the 
windings comprising a body having first and second spaced 
apart sections which receive respective ends of the 
windings to be interconnected and an electrically 
conductive element extending between the two sections and 
to which the winding ends are to be connected, said 
sections including means for resisting outward movement 
of the winding ends due to centrifugal force so as to 
reduce the likelihood of disconnection between the 
winding ends and the conductive element. The conductive element preferably includes connector 
portions for connection to the respective winding ends 
such that one of the portions or ends respectively lies 
radially inboard of the other. Preferably, the connector 
portions of the conductive element lie radially inboard 
of the ends of the windings to be connected thereto. In 
such a case, the end sections of the windings will lie 
between the connector portions and the support means. The aforesaid connector portions and the support means  
 
are
