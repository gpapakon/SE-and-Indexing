<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIMICROBIAL DENTIFRICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1 . FIELD OF THE INVENTION:This invention relates to antimicrobial dentifrice compositions which are capable of activating or supplementing the naturally occurring salivary peroxidase system, and methods of preventing toothdecay using said compositions. In particular, aqueous dentifrice compositions are described which, upon application and use, are capable of producing or, in the presence of saliva, leading to the production of a specific antimicrobial compound known as hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-) or derivatives thereof. Methods of making the invented compositions are also described herein.2. DOCUMENT DISCLOSUREA disclosure document, No. 292830, was previously filed on this invention on October 7, 1991 , and retention thereof is respectfully requested.3. ART BACKGROUND:There is general acceptance as to the etiology of dental caries and periodontal disease in that microflora found in the oral environment are capable of accumulating upon oral surfaces and in unexposed pockets, thriving and producing damaging metabolites in the absence of proper dental hygiene. Colonies of microbes, undisturbed for even short periods of time, are able to 

 aggressively adhere to the surface of enamel, establishing a foothold for further colony growth. Many of the bacterial types commonly found in the mouth secrete polysaccharides such as glucans and dextrans, which form a supportive matrix and thus provide a more mechanically stable environment for further proliferation. Subgingivally, undisturbed colonies of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can establish similar polysaccharide matrices, in addition to pocket-type formations.These polysaccharide matrices, together with the thriving microflora contained therein, make up what is commonly referred to as plaque. The first stages in plaque formation occur almost immediately after an enamel surface is scraped, cleaned and polished in dental office toothcleaning procedures. As colony numbers increase, and the structural integrity of the surrounding polysaccharide matrix evolves, plaque becomes a potential source of bacterial metabolites such as lactic acid. In intimate contact with the enamel surface, acidic plaque metabolites are thus capable of lowering the pH of the enamel surface to a point at which demineralization of the hydroxyapatite can occur. Such demineralization is known to be the cause of tooth decay, also known as caries. Subgingivally, plaque and pocket colonies are known to cause demineralization of both enamel
