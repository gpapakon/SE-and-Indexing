A fuel delivery module with a fuel level sensor in a fuel tank with a guide 
which is arranged between a flange (3) and a part of the fuel delivery 

module serving as pump holder (12), wherein the guide is provided with a 
spring against the force of the movement of the flange and the pump holder 

(12) in the guide in the longitudinal direction of the fuel delivery module, 
characterised In that the connection between the flange (3) and the upper 

end of the pump holder (12) is effected via a first bearing (11) which is 
displaceable in the aforesaid longitudinal direction and can swivel relative to 

the flange and that the lower end (28) of the pump holder (12) serves as a 
second bearing around which the fuel tank (2) or a swirl pot can move or 

swivel, so that upon angular deviation from the set position of the flange (3) 
and/or the bottom of the fuel tank the fuel delivery module and the fuel level 

sensor arranged thereon retain their set positions. 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the transition between the flange (3) and the pump 

holder (12) is effected in a one-piece manner via a housing section (38) 
which is firstly resilient at learn in the aforesaid longitudinal direction (37) 

and therefore is longitudinally displaceable and secondly can be swivelled 
relative to the flange (3). 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the housing section (38) has recesses (39) which are 

staggered relative to one another. 
A fuel delivery module according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the recesses (39) are oblong, especially rectangular or 

rhomboid and are aligned in their longitudinal direction approximately parallel 
to the circumference of the housing section (38).  

 
A fuel delivery module according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the recesses (39) are firstly arranged at the same 

height in a row (40a, 40b, 40c, 40d) behind one another and spaced 
uniformly and that a plurality of rows (40a, 40b, 40c, 40d) are arranged 

beneath each other and are staggered in an angular manner. 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the connection between the flange (3) and the pump 

holder (12) is effected through at least one pin (14, 15) which is guided so 
that it can move in the aforesaid longitudinal direction in a correspondingly 

formed longitudinal groove (13) and can swivel at least about the 
longitudinal axis of the pin. 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the pin (14, 15) is arranged on a spherical elevation 

(19, 20) in such a manner that the flange (3) can swivel relative to the pump 
holder (12) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (37) of the pin (14, 15). 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 6 or claim 7,
 
characterised in that a shoulder (10) is arranged as a closed or open section 

on the flange (3) and in which or about which an open or closed section 
formed on the upper end (16) of the pump holder (12) is guided so that it 

can undergo displacement in the aforesaid longitudinal direction and swivel 
movement. 
A fuel delivery module according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the lower end (28) of the pump holder (12) in the form 

of a support foot is braced with positive engagement against the bottom (6) 
of the fuel tank (2) or against a side wall (30) of a swirl pot (5) of suitable 

geometry.  
 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that the lower end (28) of the pump holder (12) is rounded. 
A fuel delivery module according to claim 9 or claim 10,
 
characterised in that the lower end (28) of the pump holder (12) in a 

sectional area through the longitudinal axis perpendicular to the bottom of 
the fuel tank is semi-circular and in a top view is wedge-shaped. 
A fuel delivery module according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that a swirl pot is integrated at the lower end (28) of the 

pump holder (12) and that the bottom (6) of the fuel tank (2) is guided 
around the swirl pot so as to permit swivel or rotational movement.
