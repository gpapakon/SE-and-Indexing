<ABSTRACT>
The integrated metallic reinforcement bars extend crossways to and through the insulating body. The insulating body in the through passage area of the reinforcement bars has corresp. straight (10) or inclined (9,13) recesses running through it. The number of these recesses matches the max. load situation, and only a part of them is fitted with reinforcement bars. The insulating body is fitted only with cross-force bars and horizontal tractive and pressure bars. For each inclinedly running recess (9) through the insulating body an identical recess (13) is provided. The unused recesses (9,10,13) on the outside of the insulating body are provided with easily removable closures (11,14).

Constructional element for providing thermal insulation between two parts of a construction 
to be concreted, in particular between a building and an outer part connected thereto, consisting of 

an insulating body (1) to be laid therebetween, the insulating body (1) having integrated metal 
reinforcement bars (2, 3, 4) which extend across and through the insulating body (1) and project at 

both sides into the parts of the construction to be concreted, the insulating body (1) having in the area 
where the reinforcement bars (2, 3, 4) project through corresponding recesses which extend straight 

(10) or diagonally (9, 13) through the insulating body (1),
 
characterised in that
 
the number of said recesses (9, 10, 13) is designed for the case of maximum loading and part only 

of said recesses (9, 10, 13) is fitted with reinforcement bars (2, 3, 4). 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the insulating body (1) is 
fitted solely with transverse-force bars (2, 3) and with tension and compression bars (4) which extend 

through horizontally. 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that there is generally associated 
with each recess (9) which extends diagonally through the insulating body a recess (13) which is a 

mirror-image thereof. 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the unused recesses (9, 10, 
13) are provided on the outsides of the insulating body (1) with easily removable closures (11, 14). 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the insulating body (1) has 
an upper (5) and lower (6) portion which are separable at a joint (12) extending along the recesses 

(9, 10, 13). 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the insulating body (1) has 
on its narrow side surfaces cutouts (15) or projections (16) which match up with corresponding 

projections or cutouts on the relevant neighbouring insulating body. 
Constructional element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the recesses (9, 10, 13) 
repeat at grid-like distances on the insulating body.
