<ABSTRACT>
A creel equipped with devices for twisting nontwisted yarns and feeding the twisted yarns directly to specific machine such 
as a loom or a warper, and designed such that a required number of bobbins (3) on each of which an untwisted yarn (2) is wound 

are disposed and said yarns (2) are drawn from said bobbins (3) to be twisted while being fed to a specific machine in parallel 
with each other at the same time, which creel is provided with: spindles (5) to fixedly support and rotate said bobbins (3); driving 

mechanisms (6 and 6a) to drive said spindles (5); bobbin attachments (7) each fixed to the forward end of said bobbin (3) fixedly 
supported by said spindle (5) and having a yarn storage part (8) on which a yarn adjusting ring (9) is fitted; so that said nontwisted 

yarn (2) is drawn from said bobbin (3), passed through said yarn storage part (8) and yarn adjusting ring (9), and then twisted 
while guided toward the specific machine and supplied to the machine as a twisted yarn (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a creel for 
twisting non-twist yarn and supplying the same to a 
predetermined machine such as a loom or a warper. For the production of a belt-like woven cloth 
in the prior art, while using a twist yarn as a warp, 
such as a safety belt or a sling, there is a method in 
which a beam is prepared by winding thereon a 
predetermined number of twist yarns before a weaving 
operation, or a method in which a bobbin is formed by 
winding thereon a preliminarily prepared twist yarn and a 
plurality of the bobbins are arranged on a creel to be 
supplied to a loom as warps. There are problems when a twist yarn is used 
for a weaving operation as a warp yarn. That is, it is 
necessary to vary a twist number in accordance with the 
use of a woven cloth and/or specific properties of the 
yarn so that the required feeling to the touch is 
obtained in the resultant cloth. Since a yarn twisting 
is not usually carried out by a weaver but is done by an 
outside twister, it is almost impossible to change a 
twist number after the yarn twisting has been completed, 
even if it has been found that the twist number is 
unsuitable for the desired cloth. Also, since it is not 
certain that the same length of twist yarn is wound on 
the respective bobbin, a waste of the twist yarn may be 
generated due to this difference of the yarn length 
between the bobbins. Moreover, since a length of the twist yarn 
wound on a bobbin is at most one half, usually less than 
one third of that of a large packaged material yarn 
bobbin, a troublesome bobbin exchanging and yarn tying 
operation is necessary midway in the weaving process,  
 
and, in some uses, the resultant product may be inferior 
in the tied portion and cannot be used. As stated above, 
when a cloth is woven while a twist yarn is used as a 
warp yarn, there are more inconveniences compared with a 
case when non-twist yarns are directly supplied to a loom 
from a creel. On the other hand, when a non-twist yarn is 
used as a warp yarn and is directly supplied from a 
creel, it is almost unnecessary to tie original yarns to 
each other during the weaving process, because the yarns 
are supplied from the respective large packaged bobbins. 
Further since an unwinding process and a warping process 
can be eliminated and a yarn twisting through an outside 
twister is unnecessary, the productivity thereof is 
superior to that of the former. However, there are 
several problems in the product quality in that the 
feeling to the touch is limited to a

<CLAIMS>
A creel (1) for supplying twist yarns (4) arranged 
parallel to each other to a predetermined machine 

(13), each of which is prepared by withdrawing a non-twist 
yarn (2) from one of multiple bobbins (3) 

arranged on the creel (1) and twisting the non-twist 
yarn (2) midway of the supply passage to the 

predetermined machine (13), comprising a plurality of 
spindles (5) each supporting the respective bobbin 

(3),
characterized by
 at least one means for driving the 
spindles (5) in an optional rotational direction and 

at an optional rotational speed, and an attachment 
(7) with a yarn storage (8) for temporarily storing a 

part of a yarn just withdrawn from said bobbin (3) on 
a surface thereof and being mounted at a tip end of 

the bobbin (3) fixedly supported on the spindle (5) 
and on which a yarn adjustment ring (9) for braking 

said yarn just withdrawn from said 
bobbin (3) by frictionally engaging the yarn between a surface of said 

yarn storage (8) and said ring (9) so as not to be 
freely released from said bobbin (3), is fitted, 

wherein after the non-twist yarn (2) is withdrawn 
from the bobbin (3) and during being directed to the 

predetermined machine (13) after passing through the yarn storage 
(8) and the yarn adjusting ring (9), a twist is 

imparted to the non-twist yarn (2) to obtain a twist 
yarn (4) by the rotation of the respective bobbin 

(3).  
 
A creel (1) according to claim 1, comprising a 
plurality of spindles (5), each one of the ends of 

the respective spindles (5), fixedly 
supporting a bobbin (3) on which a non-twist yarn (2) 

is wound so that the bobbin (3) is rotatable together 
with the spindle (5) and at least one means for 

driving spindles (5), in which a twist is imparted to 
the non-twist yarn (3) while the non-twist yarn (2) 

is withdrawn from the bobbin (3) and supplied to a 
predetermined machine (13), wherein each of the 

spindles (5) is a single spindle (5) having at least 
two bearings in the middle portion thereof as seen 

from the front side and extending rightward and 
leftward to form holders for fixedly supporting the 

bobbins (3) and a plurality of the spindles (5) are 
arranged to form multiple horizontal rows positioned

means for driving spindles is a plurality of systems, 

each comprising a motor and a gearing means so that 
the respective system can change the rotational 

direction and the rotational speed of the spindle.

the predetermined machine (13) is a loom or a warper. 
A system for producing a fabric, wherein a creel (1)

aforementioned claims and a fabric forming device 
(13) being serially arranged with said creel (1), are
