<ABSTRACT>
A photocatalyst based mainly on titanium 
dioxide or a mixture of titanium dioxide and 

activated charcoal is fixed using fluororesin or 
the like to produce a sheet or panel-shaped 

purifying material, which is disposed in the 
outdoors utilizing exterior walls of a building, 

in order to remove low-concentration nitrogen 
oxides and the like in environmental atmosphere. 

The photocatalyst applied with near-ultraviolet 
rays in sunlight is activated to convert nitrogen 

oxides in the atmosphere to nitric acid and the 
like and catch the products on the surface. The 

photocatalyst reduced in activity due to 
accumulation of the products is washed by 

rainfall to restore the activity. Further, using 
the purifying material, volatile pollutants 

transferred from water to a gas, or pollutants in 
water are decomposed by titanium dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for removing low-concentration pollutants
(nitrogen oxides and the like) in the
environmental atmosphere and pollutants (volatile
organic chlorine compounds and the like) in water.In order to control air pollution due to
nitrogen oxides and the like, regulations have
been effected up to now against emission of
pollutants from mobile and stationary emission
sources. However, in spite of measures against
these emission sources, high-concentration
pollutants exceeding the environmental standards
are still observed in big cities and along car
roads. Therefore, more effective measures
against the individual pollutions, that is, in
addition to measures against emission sources as
ever, environmental measures at the pollutant
receiving side are in demand.However, removal of pollutants in
environment (environmental purifying) is partly 
being tried in the field of water purifying of
lakes and the like, but no attempt has been made
on the atmospheric environment.This is because efficient removal has been
considered to be difficult since air pollutants
are very low in concentration and rapidly
diffusing in the atmosphere. For example, when
the conventional selective catalytic reduction
method with ammonia is applied to the atmosphere,
high-rate concentration is essentially required
before reduction, which has been impracticable in
view of energy consumption. The document "Patent Abstracts of Japan Vol. 14 (1990), No. 314" discloses a process
for the removal of pollutants from exhaust gases wherein the pollutant-containing exhaust
gas is passed through a device consisting of two coaxially arranged pyrex glas tubes. On
the outer surface of the inner glas tube, titanium dioxide was deposited. While the gas was
passing the device, it was exposed to light of a wavelength of not more than 400 nm,
whereby the gas was decomposed to compounds less harmful than the pollutants.The document "Patent Abstracts of Japan Vol. 16 (1992), No. 010" discloses a device for
removing pollutants from air in motorway tunnels which device consists of a glas tube to
the outer surface of which titanium dioxide, charcoal and ferric oxide as powders are
adhered. When irradiating said device with light of wavelengths of 300 to 400 nm, the
noxious gases in the air of said tunnel adhere to the outer surface of the device.US-A 5,182,030 discloses a method of removing organic pollutants from fluids by passing
said fluids through an absorbent which is capable of absorbing said organic pollutants and
by
