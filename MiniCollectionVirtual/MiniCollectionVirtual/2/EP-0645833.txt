<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode including a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy that reversibly absorbs and desorbs hydrogen
at atmospheric pressure, and more particularly to treating the
surface of the hydrogen-absorbing alloy.Lead storage cells and nickel-cadmium storage cells have
been widely used so far; however, metal-hydrogen alkaline
storage cells are now attracting attention. A metal-hydrogen
alkaline storage cell is composed of a negative electrode using
a hydrogen-absorbing alloy as an active material and a positive
electrode using a metallic oxide such as a nickel hydroxide as
an active material. These metal-hydrogen alkaline storage
cells have advantages of being lighter in weight, larger in
capacity, and higher in energy density than these conventional
storage cells.The hydrogen-absorbing alloy used in a metal-hydrogen
alkaline storage cell is applied various surface treatments in
order to improve the cell characteristics.For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-79474
discloses the use of an alkaline aqueous solution for a surface
treatment of the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The surface 
treatment realizes the formation of a nickel-rich layer over
the surface of the hydrogen-absorbing alloy. The nickel-rich
layer accelerates smooth absorption of oxygen gas generated
from the positive electrode during overcharge because nickel
works as a catalyzer in a reducing reaction of oxygen.
Consequently, the rise in cell internal pressure is restricted
and charge/discharge cycle characteristics are improved.Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 3-98259
discloses the use of hot water of 60°C or higher for a surface
treatment of a hydrogen-absorbing alloy. This method also
realizes the formation of a nickel rich layer with the same
effects as the above case.However, these surface treatments to form a nickel rich
layer have an undesirable side effect of producing hydroxide.
The hydroxide increases the contact resistance among hydrogen-absorbing
alloy particles or decreases the activity of the
hydrogen-absorbing alloys, thereby deteriorating the high rate
charge/discharge characteristics and low temperature discharge
characteristics in the initial charge/discharge cycle.The following methods have been proposed for improving the
high rate charge/discharge characteristics and low temperature
discharge characteristics in the initial charge/discharge
cycle.
