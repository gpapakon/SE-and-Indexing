<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid state image 
sensor in which a plurality of photoelectric conversion 
elements are arranged in a plane two dimensional array. There is a per se known type of solid state image 
sensor which forms an image of an object to be photographed, 
and which is used in a video camera or the like. With this type of solid state image sensor, a 
plurality of photodiodes (photoelectric conversion 
elements) are arranged in a plurality of X axis rows to form 
a plane two dimensional array, and X axis direction CCDs 
(Charge Coupled Devices) are provided in correspondence 
with this plurality of X axis rows of photodiodes; and 
further each of the X axis CCDs is connected to a single CCD 
in the Y axis direction via a respectively corresponding 
plurality of relay CCD elements. The output signals of the photodiodes included in each 
X axis row of photodiodes are input in parallel to the 
corresponding X axis CCD, and then these signals are 
transmitted in series via the relay CCD elements to the 
single Y axis CCD. This Y axis CCD transmits the  
 
photoelectric conversion signals received from the X axis 
CCDs in series in the Y axis direction, and outputs them to 
an external image signal processing circuit. Now, the CCDs which are provided for transmitting the 
output signals of the photodiodes themselves exhibit the 
function of photoelectric conversion, and they have the 
characteristic that, if strong light is incident upon their 
CCD elements they perform photoelectric conversion and 
generate electrical charges. In particular, if strong 
light is incident upon the Y axis CCD, the charges which are 
thereby generated flow to the X axis CCDs via the plurality 
of relay CCD elements provided between this Y axis CCD and 
the X axis CCDs, and, because these electric charges are 
undesirably added to the output signals of the photodiodes, 
the photoelectric conversion signals become unusable. Accordingly, it is necessary reliably to prevent the 
light bundle from the object which is directed to fall upon 
the plurality of photodiodes from being incident upon the Y 
axis CCD. However, with prior art solid state image sensors, the 
problem arises that, since the distance between each of the 
X axis CCDs and the Y axis CCD is small, the Y axis CCD comes 
to be not sufficiently protected from light, and therefore 
as described above photoelectric conversion is performed by 
the Y axis CCD and electric charges are generated, so that  
 
as these charges flow to the X axis CCDs the
