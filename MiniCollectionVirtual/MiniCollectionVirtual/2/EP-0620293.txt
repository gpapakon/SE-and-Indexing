<ABSTRACT>
A composition suitable for the treatment of surfaces 
of copper and copper alloys is disclosed. It comprises, 

(a) a cupric complex of an azole compound, (b) an organic 
acid having a boiling point or a decomposition point of 

230째C or lower, (c) a difficultly volatile complexing 
agent, (d) a complexing agent having a complexing power 

which is weaker than that of the azole compound, and (e) 
water. The treatment of copper or copper alloys with 

the composition produces abraded surface with moderate 
irregularities, thereby ensuring better adhesion of 

various resists thereto and increased solderability. The 
composition is particularly useful for the manufacture of 

printed-wiring boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for 
the treatment of surfaces of copper or copper alloys 
which is useful in removing rust and in roughening the 
surfaces of these materials. A treatment called microetching which consists of 
chemically abrading copper surfaces is performed in the 
manufacture of printed-wiring boards for promoting 
adhesion of etching resists and solder resists and for 
improving the soldering performances when electronic 
components are fixed to the wiring boards. The 
microetching consists of chemically abrading the surfaces 
of copper using an aqueous solution comprising sulfuric 
acid and hydrogen peroxide or an aqueous solution 
comprising a persulfate, as major components. The treatment using an etching agent comprising 
sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide or a persulfate, as 
major components, however, may cause corrosion of the 
wiring circuit and, in the worst case, may break the 
circuit, if the components in the etching agent remain in 
the substrate due to insufficient washing. These  
 
conventional etching agents produce mists during the 
treatment operation, which may pollute the working 
environment. Therefore, there has been a desire for the 
development of a composition for the treatment of 
surfaces of copper and copper alloys, which does not 
cause corrosion of the circuit, does not involve a risk 
of the circuit breakage, and does not accompany the 
production of mists and noxious gases, thereby improving 
the circumstances where the printed-wiring boards are 
manufactured. As a result of extensive studies, the present 
inventors have found that a combination of a cupric complex 
of azole compound, specific organic acid, and specific 
complexing compounds can provide a surface treating agent 
which satisfies these requirements. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a composition for the treatment of surfaces of 
copper and copper alloys which comprises, 
(a) 1-5% by weight of a cupric complex of an azole compound, (b) 5-30% by 
weight of an organic acid having a boiling point or a decomposition point of 230째C or 
lower and capable of dissolving copper, (c) 1-20% by weight of a difficultly volatile 
complexing agent which has a complexing power stronger than that of the azole 
compound and stabilizes the copper dissolved in the organic acid, (d) 0.5-10% by 
weight of a complexing agent having a complexing power which is weaker than the 
complexing power of the azole compound, and (e) balance water.  
 These and other objects,
