<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for implementing switching in the time or space domain. In the method, the switching is effected on the basis of switching data contained in an address control memory (66; 93), and a basic switching block (42) is defined on the basis of an incoming frame structure so that the number of its time slots corresponds to the greatest possible number of signals of the lowest level of hierarchy (TU-12) to be switched in the frame, said basic switching block recurring in the same form with respect to switching. In order for the switching to be simplified (i) the number of the switching instructions to be stored in the address control memory (66; 93) corresponds to the size of the basic switching block, whereby when the basic switching block also contains higher-level signals, the same switching instruction is used in the address control memory (66; 93) at given intervals, depending on how said signals occur in the basic switching block, and (ii) the same address control memory (66; 93) is read during the entire frame structure, whereby it gives a switching instruction to all time slots in the frame, and (iii) the switching instructions read from the address control memory (66; 93) are skipped during the time slots which are not cross-connected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to
the preamble of the accompanying claim 1 for implementing
switching in the time domain, and to a method
according to the preamble of the accompanying claim 3
for implementing switching in the space domain, for
signals of several different levels of hierarchy, said
signals having a common frame structure. An example of
such a frame structure is the frame structure of an STM-1
signal used in the SDH system; this frame structure
will be illustrated in greater detail below.The method of the invention can thus be used
in both time and space switches. In this connection,
time switch refers to a device capable of switching the
contents of any time slot in the frame structure of an
incoming signal to any time slot in an outgoing frame
structure (switching in time). In addition to a time
switch, this device can also be called a time slot
interchanger. Space switch, in turn, refers to a switch
capable of connecting any incoming line to any outgoing
line (switching in space).In known switching methods, the switching of
e.g. the tributary unit groups (TU-12, TU-2, TU-3) of
an STM-1 frame is implemented by giving switching
instructions separately to 3, 21 or 63 columns by starting
the switching from column 13 on TU-3 level and from
column 19 on TU-2 and TU-12 levels. It has thus been
possible to effect the switching on one level at a time.
Another way has been to switch columns 19 to 270 in
blocks of 63 columns, and to give switching instructions
separately to columns 13 to 18 on TU-3 level. In this
way it has been possible to effect cross-connection on
all the three levels at the same time. The drawback of the known switching methods is,
however, that they entail fairly complicated practical
equipment.The object of the present invention is to
remedy the drawback described above. This is achieved
with a method of the invention, which, as regards time
switching, is characterized by what is disclosed in the
characterizing part of the accompanying claim 1 and, as
regards space switching, by what is disclosed in the
characterizing part of the accompanying claim 3.The idea of the invention is to utilize the
frame structure of an incoming signal by defining a
basic switching block, which recurs in the frame structure
in the same form from the point of view of switching,
and to effect the switching of all time slots
merely on the basis of an address control memory
intended for the switching of said basic switching block
by reading said memory cyclically, and by skipping the
swi

A method for implementing time switching for
signals of several different levels of hierarchy, said

signals having a common frame structure, in which method
the contents of the time slots of an incoming signal are

written into a memory (61) at a memory location determined
by a write address (WA) and read from said memory

(61) at the memory locations indicated by switching data
contained in an address control memory (66), and a basic

switching block is defined on the basis of the frame
structure of an incoming signal so that the number of

its time slots corresponds to the greatest possible
number of signals of the lowest level of hierarchy (TU-12)

to be switched, said basic switching block recurring
in the same form with respect to the switching,
characterized
 in that

the number of switching instructions to be
stored in the address control memory (66) corresponds

to the size of the basic switching block (42), whereby
when the basic switching block also contains higher-level

signals, the same switching instruction is used
in the address control memory (66) at given intervals,

depending on how said signals occur in the basic switching
block (42), and
the same address control memory (66) is read
during the entire frame structure, whereby it gives a

switching instruction to all time slots in the frame,
and
the switching instructions read from the
address control memory (66) are skipped during the time

slots which are not cross-connected.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the switching instruction used
is a relative read address, which indicates the relative 

transition of the data contained in the time slot within
the frame structure, the switching instruction being

forced to become zero during the time slots which are
not cross-connected.
A method for implementing switching in the
space domain for signals of several different levels of

hierarchy, said signals having a common frame structure,
in which method the switching is effected on the basis

of switching data included in an address control memory
(93), and a basic switching block (42) is defined on the

basis of an incoming frame structure so that the number
of its time slots corresponds to the greatest possible

number of signals of the lowest level of hierarchy (TU-12)
to be switched, said basic switching block (42)

recurring in the same form with respect to switching,
characterized
 in that

the number of switching instructions to be
stored in the address control memory (93) corresponds

to the size of the basic switching block (42), whereby

slots which are not cross-connected.
