<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substrate having a superconductor 
layer thereon. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
substrate having an intermediate layer on which a superconductor layer is 
deposited. The superconductive phenomenon which is explained to be a kind of 
phase change of electrons was thought to be a phenomenon which can be 
observed under extremely low temperature. However, in 1986, Bednorz 
and Müller discovered a new oxide type superconductor [La, Sr]₂CuO₄ 
which shows superconductivity at 30 K (Z. Phys. B64, 1986 p 189). C. 
W. Chu et al. discovered another superconducting material of 
YBa₂Cu₃O7-x which shows the critical temperature of about 90 K in 1987 
(Physical Review letters, Vol. 58, No. 9, p 908). Maeda et al discovered 
Bi-containing superconductor in 1988 (Japanese Journal of Applied 
Physics. Vol. 27, No. 2, p 1209 to 1210). In these newly discovered 
oxide superconductors, the superconductive phenomenon can be realized 
with relatively cheaper liquid nitrogen and hence the possibility of an 
actual utilization of the high Tc superconductors have burst onto the 
scene.  The above-mentioned oxide superconductors were prepared in a 
bulk form of sintered block by powder sintering technique. The sintered 
articles, however, shows very poor critical current density. In order to 
overcome this problem, a variety of deposition techniques have been 
studied to prepare thin films of these superconductors. The superconductors of compound oxides can be deposited on a 
substrate such as SrTiO₃, MgO etc. by physical vapour deposition (PVD) 
including vacuum-deposition, sputtering, ion-plating, molecular beam 
epitaxy (MBE) and by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique such as 
MO-CVD. Although remarkable improvement in the critical current density of 
these compound oxides have been achieved in their thin films, the 
conventional thin films of superconducting compound oxides are still 
insufficient to be used for fabricating actual electronics devices because 
the thin films are not homogeneous microscopically in addition to 
relatively lower critical current density. Therefore, there is a demand to 
develop a thin film, preferably a thin film of a single crystal of 
superconducting compound oxide which is deposited uniform in quality 
on a large area of a substrate and has an improved critical current density 
and which can be utilized in fabrication of a variety of electronics devices. It is believed that the thin films of superconducting compound oxide 
depos
