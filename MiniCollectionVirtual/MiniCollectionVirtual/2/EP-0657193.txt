<ABSTRACT>
A ski brake which can assume a travelling position and a braking position, having a base plate (2) which can be fastened on a ski or a ski binding and on which braking levers (4a, 4b) arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal centre plane and each having a braking arm (6a, 6b) and an actuating arm (5a, 5b) are articulated such that they can be pivoted about an axis (Q1) running essentially transversely with respect to the ski, and having a tread plate (7) which is connected to the base plate (2) via a connection piece (9) and is forced upwards by at least one actuating spring (10a, 10b) which is mounted in the base plate (2) and, via at least one extension arm (12a, 12b), acts on the underside of the tread plate (7) at a distance from the connection piece (9) - as seen from the side -it being possible for the point at which the spring (10a, 10b) acts on the tread plate to be changed in the longitudinal direction by a pivot movement of the braking lever (4a, 4b).

A ski brake adapted to assume an inactive position and
an active position and comprising a base plate (2) adapted

to be secured to a ski or a ski binding, brake levers (4a,
4b) each having a braking arm (6a,6b) and an actuator arm

(5a,5b) and mounted on said base plate (2) at symmetric positions
relative to the longitudinal center plane for rotation

about an axis (Q1) extending substantially transversely
of the ski, and a step plate (7) biased substantially upwards

by at least one actuator spring (10a,10b) mounted in
said base plate (2), and connected to said base plate (2) by

a hinged connecting piece (9), said actuator arms (5a,5b) of
said brake levers (4a,4b) being connected to said step plate

(7), and said braking arms (6a,6b) of said brake levers (4a,
4b) being swivelled towards the longitudinal axis of the ski

in said inactive position relative to their positioning in
the active position, characterized in that said actuator

spring (10a,10b) engages the bottom side of said step plate
(7) via at least one extension arm (12a,12b) at a location

spaced from said connecting piece (9) as viewed from the
side, the engagement point of said extension arm (12a,12b)

on said step plate (7) being longitudinally displaceable in
response to rotation of said brake levers (4a,4b).
A ski brake according to claim 1, characterized in that
said extension arm (12a,12b) has its end engaging said step

plate (7) provided with a slide element (13) taking support
on a slide face (15,15') provided on the underside of said

step plate (7).
A ski brake according to claim 2, characterized in that
said actuator spring (10a,10b) is composed of two helical

torsion springs disposed at symmetric locations relative to
the longitudinal center plane and mounted on a cross pin (8) 

disposed in said base plate (2), each said torsion spring
being integrally formed with a respective extension arm (12a

12b) symmetrical to the longitudinal center plane, the ends
of said extension arms (12a,12b) being bent transversely of

the longitudinal axis of the ski and connected to one another
by said slide element (13) preferably made of plastic

material (figs. 3,5).
A ski brake according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in
that said slide face (15) is planar and extends substantially

parallel to the top face of the step plate (7) (fig.1)
A ski brake according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in
that said slide face (15') has an inclined section (15'b)

merging towards the rear with a section (15'c) extending
substantially parallel to the top face of said step plate

(fig. 1a).
A ski brake according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that said slide face (15,15') is formed on a bearing member

(14,14') preferably made of metal and secured to said step
plate (7) as by riveting at the bottom side thereof.
A ski brae according to claim 6, characterized in that
in a per se known manner said bearing member (14,14') is

formed with two shell-shaped recessed portions (16a,16b)
symmetric to the longitudinal center plane each for receiving

therein the inwards bent end portion (17a,17b) of a
respective one of said actuator arms (5a,5b), said inwards

bent end portions (17a,17b) of said actuator arms (5a,5b)
being interconnected in a per se known manner by a resilient

connecting piece, preferably a spring (20) biasing said
brake arms (6a,6b) of said brake levers (4a,4b) laterally

outwards.
