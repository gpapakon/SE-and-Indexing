<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article such as a sanitary napkin, having an improved topsheet that provides improved skin comfort as well as superior fluid handling characteristics. Such absorbent articles comprise a main body portion preferably comprising a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, and an absorbent core positioned between the topsheet and the backsheet. The main body portion has longitudinal edges and lateral edges. The topsheet has a central zone and a pair of end zones extending laterally outwardly from and contiguous with the central zone. The topsheet comprises a nonwoven outer layer and an apertured thermoplastic film layer. The nonwoven outer layer has an opening positioned in the central zone. The apertured thermoplastic film layer is positioned beneath the nonwoven outer layer so that the apertured thermoplastic film layer and the nonwoven outer layer covers the end zones while the apertured thermoplastic film layer is exposed through the opening of the nonwoven outer layer in the central zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as sanitary 
napkins, adult incontinence pads, and the like. Still more particularly, the 
present invention concerns an improved topsheet providing excellent skin 
comfort and fluid acquisition. All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the 
absorption of body fluids such as menses, urine, and feces are, of course, 
well known. Generally, absorbent articles comprise a liquid pervious 
topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet, and an absorbent core positioned 
between the topsheet and the backsheet. The exudates from a wearers 
body readily penetrate through the topsheet and are contained in the 
absorbent core. The topsheet serves at least two purposes. First, the topsheet 
provides fluid handling properties including rapid aquisition of fluids through 
the topsheet and into the absorbent core and the prevention of "re-wet" of 
those fluids absorbed by the absorbent corn, that is, fluids once absorbed 
into the absorbent core will not leak back through the topsheet to wet the 
wearers skin. Second, the topsheet provides skin comfort by being 
compliant, sort feeling, dry, and non-irritating to the wearers skin. In order to provide better fluid handling characteristics and skin 
comfort, apertured thermoplastic films have been developed as a material 
for the topsheet. Apertured thermoplastic films have been preferred for the 
topsheet because they are pervious to liquids and yet non-absorbent. Thus  
 
the surface of the apertured thermoplastic film which is in contact with the 
body remains dry and is more comfortable to the wearer. Such apertured 
thermoplastic films are available in the marketplace, and include films 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,929,135, entitled "Absorptive Structure Having 
Tapered Capillaries", issued to Thompson on December 30, 1975; U.S.

Topsheet", issued to Mullane and Smith on April 13, 1982; U.S.

Properties", issued to Radel and Thompson on August 3, 1982; and U.S.

Plastic Web Exhibiting Non-Glossy Visible Surface and Cloth-Like Tactile 
Impression", which issued to Ahr, Louis, Mullane, and Ouellette on July 31, 
1984, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Absorbent articles having a central zone which comprises sites of hydrophylically treated 
fibrous materials

An absorbent article (20) comprising:
 
   a main body portion (22) having longitudinal edges (24) and lateral edges (26), 

said main body portion (22) comprising:
 
   a liquid pervious topsheet (30) having a central zone (32) and end 

zones (34) extending laterally from and contiguous with said 
central zone (32), said topsheet being characterized in that it comprises: 


a) a nonwoven outer layer (70) having an opening positioned in 
said central zone (32), and 
b) an apertured thermoplastic film layer (80) having 
longitudinal edges, said apertured thermoplastic film 

layer (80) being positioned beneath said nonwoven outer 
layer (70) so that said apertured thermoplastic film layer (80) 

and said nonwoven outer layer (70) cover said end zones (34) 
and said apertured thermoplastic film layer (80) is exposed 

through said opening of said nonwoven outer layer (70) in 
said central zone (32); 
 
   a liquid impervious backsheet (50); and
 
   an absorbent core (60) having side edges, said absorbent 

core (60) positioned between said topsheet (30) and said 
backsheet (50). 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said nonwoven 
outer layer (70) comprises two strips (74, 76) spaced apart on top of said 

apertured thermoplastic film layer (80) so that the spaced apart region 
between said two strips (74, 76) forms said opening. 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 or 2 additionally comprising a 
nonwoven secondary layer (40) positioned between said topsheet (30) 

and said absorbent core (60). 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 3 wherein said nonwoven 
secondary layer (40) and said nonwoven outer layer (70) consists of a 

single piece of material c-folded around said longitudinal edges of 
said apertured thermoplastic film layer (80) in each said end zone (34) 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said absorbent 
core (60) is positioned below said central zone (32) and said end zones (34) 
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said side edges of
