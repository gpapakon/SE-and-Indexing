<ABSTRACT>
When background noise is superposed on speech, a 
speech decoder can well represent the background noise 

through signal processing only in the speech decoder even 
at low bit rates. In the speech decoder, a decoding 

circuit receives a signal from a speech coder, a speech 
detecting circuit detects non-speech and speech intervals, 

and a excitation signal calculating circuit calculates a 
excitation signal using a sound source signal, a pitch 

period, and an average amplitude. A signal reproducing 
circuit drives a filter composed of a spectrum parameter 

to reproduce a sound signal. A searching circuit stores a 
set of random number code vectors of a predetermined bit 

number as a code book, and searches the code book for a 
best random number code vector which is selected. A 

second signal reproducing circuit reproduces a sound 
signal (noise) using the selected random number code 

vector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
reproducing well background noise superposed on a speech
signal, and more particularly to a speech decoder for
improving the reproducibility of background noise to
increase speech quality through signal processing only at
a receiver side without getting any auxiliary information
from a transmitter side relative to background noise.One known system for coding and decoding speech
signals transmitted at low bit rates is a CELP system as
described in "CODE-EXCITED LINEAR PREDICTION (CELP):
HIGH-QUALITY SPEECH AT VERY LOW BIT RATES" written by M.
R. Schroeder and B. S. Atal (Proc. ICASSP, pp. 937 - 940,
1985) (literature 1). A system for improving speech
quality at the CELP low bit rates is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 3-243999 (literature 2).The conventional systems disclosed in the
literatures 1, 2 have a problem in that when background
noise is superposed on a speech signal, it is difficult to
represent well the background noise in non-speech intervals,
resulting in poor speech quality, at low bit rates
of 4.8 kb/s or lower. From the EP-A-0544101 a speech decoder having decoding means for decoding a
coded input signal, speech detecting means for detecting a speech interval and a
non-speech interval, background noise synthesizer means for synthesizing
background noise, switching means for switching between an output of the
decoding means and the background noise synthesizer means and a signal
reproducing means for reproducing a signal selected by the switching means. The
background noise synthesizer means synthesizes a background sound based on
background noise parameter codes encoded with the transmission signal and a
random pattern generator. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a speech decoder for reproducing well a background
noise signal through a speech decoding process at a receiver
without any changes in coded speed signals and
without any added auxiliary information from a coder.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a speech decoder for reproducing noise in
a non-speech interval from a random number code vector,
and use the reproduced noise as the background noise
which makes a transmitted sound natural to the ear and
does not disturb hearing in the non-speech interval.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a speech decoder comprising
decoding means for decoding a binary coded input signal
into a spectral parameter, an average amplitude, a pitch
period and a
