<DESCRIPTION>
 FORAMINOUS SHEETS FOR USE IN CATALYSISThis invention relates to catalysts, to getters for catalysts, and to supports for catalysts or getters. More particularly, the invention relates to foraminous sheets or layers which primarily act as catalysts, as getters or as supports, and to reactors or catalyst packs including one or more of such sheets or layers.Foraminous sheets or layers have a long history of use in industrial catalytic processes such as the oxidation of ammonia to form nitric oxide or in the production of hydrogen cyanide.In the simplest arrangements, a foraminous catalytic sheet of, for example, a Pt-based alloy is supported in a reactor. The sheet is oriented within the reactor in a plane substantially perpendicular to the direction of flow through the reactor, and is positioned in the path of one or more reactants which, in use of the reactor, flow through the sheet. In so doing, the reactants undergo a catalytic reaction promoted by the material that makes up the sheet.Generally, a plurality of such sheets are assembled in overlying relation to form a layered pack of sheets. This arrangement improves the yield of the reaction by increasing the catalytic surface area exposed to the reactants during their passage through the reactor.Commonly, the reactor is a vessel of circular cross-section.Foraminous sheets for use in such a reactor are also circular with a diameter selected to fit closely within the cross- section of the reactor, thereby to ensure that all reactants pass through the sheet in their passage through the reactor. For this purpose,, each foraminous sheet (or a layered pack of such sheets) is supported around its circumference by being rigidly attached to the surrounding internal annular wall of 

the reactor .A catalytic sheet may attain incandescent temperatures under reaction conditions, for example in the catalytic oxidation of ammonia; this leads to gradual evaporation of the valuable catalytic material that makes up the sheet. The evaporated material is entrained and swept away by the flow of reactants and reaction products, and therefore may be lost. In an effort to reduce this expensive loss of catalytic material, many reactors are equipped with one or more foraminous getter or catchment sheets of, for example, a Pd-based alloy, located downstream of the catalytic sheet or sheets. Getter sheets may alternate with or otherwise be interspersed with catalytic sheets in a pack.Gettering depends upon atoms of catalytic material impinging upon the material of the getter
