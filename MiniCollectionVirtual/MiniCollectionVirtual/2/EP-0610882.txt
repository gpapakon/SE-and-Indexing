<ABSTRACT>
A storage device includes a cam member (1) rotatably disposed on 
a housing (H) side, a pin member (P) disposed on a storage cabinet (B) 

side, a lock part (4) and a guide outlet (5) formed so as to be 
mutually separated on one edge side defining a cam groove (2) of the 

cam member, and a stopper guide wall (6) integrally formed on the other 
edge side opposite to the one edge so as to project between the lock 

part and the guide outlet. The lock part fulfills the role of fastening 
the pin member positioned outside of the stopper guide wall so that 

the storage cabinet will be locked at the shut position thereof inside 
the housing against the biasing force of a spring (12) by the joint 

action of the cam member and the pin member and so that the storage 
cabinet will be enabled by farther depression of the storage cabinet 

into the housing to be automatically moved in the opening direction 
thereof from the opening of the housing. The stoage device is allowed 

to manifest a safety function for coping with the impact exerted on 
the rear side of an automobile carrying the storage device as well as 

on the front side thereof by a regulating wall (15) within the housing 
at a position capable of limiting the amount of rotation of the cam 

member when the cam member happens to rotate in the direction of 
releasing the pin member, by providing the cam member with an adjusting 

part (16) for causing the center of gravity of the cam member and the 
axis of rotation of the cam member to coincide with each other, or by 

making the cam member thicker at the lock part other than the remaining 
part of the cam member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a so-called push-open type storage device 
to be installed as in the instrument panel of an automobile, and more 
particularly to a storage device with a safety function 
according to the preamble of claim 1 or 2. 
Such a storage device is disclosed in for example US-A-5 052 728. Generally, conventional push-open type storage devices of this type 
comprise a storage cabinet openably supported in a housing which is 
provided on the side of the instrument panel of an automobile and 
constantly kept biased in the opening direction thereof by the biasing 
force of a spring, a cam member provided therein a cam groove which 
has a guide inlet, a lock part and a guide outlet, and which is rotatably 
disposed on the side of the housing, and a pin member adapted to move 
inside the cam groove of the cam member and disposed on the side of the 
storage cabinet, whereby the storage cabinet can be locked at its shut 
position inside the housing against the biasing force of the spring by 
causing the pin member to be engaged with the lock part of the cam 
groove and, by causing the storage cabinet held in the locked state to 
be depressed farther into the housing, the pin member can be released 
from the engagement with the lock part of the cam groove and the storage 
cabinet can be consequently moved automatically in the opening direction 
thereof from the opening of the housing. A typical one of the conventional storage devices is shown in 
Figures 1 and 2, wherein a cam member 21 which is a one-piece shaped 
article of synthetic resin is rotatably fitted on a fixing shaft 27 on 
the side of a housing (not shown) through a torsion spring 28 and is 
constantly kept biased by the biasing force of the torsion spring 28 in 
the direction of a regulating wall 29 until it succumbs to the control 
of the regulating wall part 29. In the specific construction of this 
cam member 21, a lock part 24 and a guide outlet 25 are formed in  
 
extreme proximity to each other on one edge side of the cam member 21 
defining a cam groove 22 and, meanwhile, a guide wall 26 adapted to 
guide a pin member P on the side of a storage cabinet (not shown) is 
formed as projecting from the other edge side opposite to the one edge 
side mentioned above. Since the cam member 21 has been developed for the sole purpose of 
guiding the pin member P exclusively in the direction of the guide 
outlet 25 by the action of an inner edge 26a of the guide wall 26, the 
leading end of the guide wall 26 is formed so as to protrude
