Mechanical elastic retaining assembly comprising 
at least first and second members (2, 5) and a spring (7) 

consisting of a continuous elastically flexible wire 
which is substantially symmetrical in relation to a 

center plane (M) and which comprises two clips (8, 9) 
which are substantially symmetrical in relation to said 

center plane and connected together by a central portion 
(10) substantially at right angles to this same center 

plane, this spring being shaped to exhibit at least first 
and second support zones, the second of which comprises 

at least a part of the central portion and is applied 
against a corresponding second support zone (2a, 5c) 

provided on second member to exert an elastic spacing 
force between the two members, this spring being 

characterized in that each clip comprises a free branch 
(8a, 9a) and a joined branch (8b, 9b), said branches 

being connected together by a flexion zone (8c, 9c) for 
offering resistance to a movement bringing them closer to 

one another, in that the joined branches of the two clips 
are substantially disposed in a first common plane (Q) 

and connected to respective intermediate portions (8d, 
9d) extending away from both the first common plane and 

the free branches of the respective clips, said 
intermediate portions being connected together by said 

central portion (10), in that the free branches of the 
two clips are substantially disposed in a second common 

plane (R), are longer than the joined branches and 
converge toward the center plane, in that each free 

branch is connected to an end portion substantially 
disposed in the second common plane and comprising a 

first segment (8e, 9e) extending away from the center 
plane, a second segment (8f, 9f) extending toward the 

flexion zone and a third segment (8g, 9g) once again 
extending away from the center plane, and in that for 

each clip the second and third segments, on the one hand, 
and the joined branch and the intermediate portion, on 

the other hand, are connected together at respective 
points (8h, 8i; 9h, 9i) close to one another; said first  

 
support zone of the spring comprising at least each first 

segment and at least a part of each free branch close to 
the flexion zone and being applied against a 

corresponding first support zone provided on the first 
member. 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the 
third segment of at least one of two clips is 
situated inside an angle formed by the joined branch and 

the intermediate portion of said clip. 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the first member consists of a sliding caliper of 

a disk-brake, and in that the second member consists of 
a friction pad of said brake. 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the spring retains two friction pads (5, 6) disposed 

symmetrically in relation to said center plane. 
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the caliper has a third support zone (20g, 21g) 

for the third segment of each clip, said third segment 
exerting on said third support zone of the caliper a 

force essentially opposite to the forces exerted by the 
first segment and the free branch of said clip on the 

first support zone of the caliper.
