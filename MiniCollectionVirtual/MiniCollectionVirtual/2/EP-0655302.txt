<ABSTRACT>
A web slitting machine (10) for cutting a web or 
roll of material includes an upper carriage assembly (16) 

joined to a lower blade holder assembly (18) by a 
selectively removable guide key (38) which is milled to 

provide a predetermined cant angle for the blade (20). 
The blade (20) is lowered into position by a piston (54, 

58) which is rectangular and includes a torsion-resisting 
sleeve (60a, 60b) to prevent rotation of the piston about 

its vertical axis. A pneumatic control provides a 
plurality of control modes whereby the blade (20) may be 

raised and lowered with or without locking the upper 
carriage assembly (16) to its transverse bar (14) and 

vice-versa. A unique side shift adjustment is provided 
whereby the blade (20) may be shifted to a half-stroke 

position and the upper carriage (16) locked when the 
blade is positioned against a lower knife (22). This 

ensures that the pressure of the blade (20) against the 
knife (22) is the pressure exerted at the mid point of 

the stroke. A parallelogram linkage (210, 212) biased by 
a spring (224) can provide a shock absorber for 

maintaining blade/knife contact in the presence of webs 
moving at high speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention relates to a web
slitting machine of the type used for cutting a
continuous web of material, and a method of adjusting an upper
blade assembly of such a machine.Web slitters are cutting machines commonly
employed to cut an endless web, such as a continuous
roll of material, into strips. Typical machines of this
type include an upper blade portion which overlaps with
a lower knife to provide a scissors-like action for
cutting a continuous roll as it is pulled between the
blade and the knife. The blade is usually a nonpowered
rotary cutting disk suspended from a carriage which is
attached to a transverse bar. A plurality of web slitters
may be connected to the same bar to create parallel
strips of various widths. The lower knife may be a
blade supported from underneath the roll or may be a
roller or drum having a sharpened edge. Together the
lower knife and the upper blade create a shearing action
against the web as it unwinds from a roll and is pulled
through the web slitter by a rewind or take-up roll.It is important in the design of such machines
that the shear or cant angle between the upper blade and
lower knife be precisely maintained. The cant angle is
the angular relationship between the upper blade and the
lower knife in the plane of the blade about a vertical
axis. This angle must be maintained so that the wear
and deformation between the two cutting edges are kept
to a minimum. The cant angle should also be adjustable 
to compensate for various blade-to-web orientations as
well as various types of web material. Rotation of the
upper blade about the aforementioned vertical axis
results in deviations From the desired cant angle and
various approaches have been tried to correct this
problem.One such approach is shown in Markowski U.S.
-A-3,143,024. In the Markowski device, the
upper blade is supported on a shaft which is clamped to
a support assembly connected to a transverse bar. The
shaft includes a milled surface which is held against a
tapered block to create the desired cant angle, and the
tapered block may be replaced for other blocks of different
dimensions, thereby providing adjustability.
Another approach is to use a clamp and a knife shaft
which are replaceable, so that various cant angles may
be obtained by substitution of these parts, an example
of which is shown in Waterhouse U.S.-A-3,186,282.
Various types of screw adjustments are shown
in Printz, et al., U.S.-A-3,185,010, Johnstone
U.S.-A-3,892,156 and Aykut U.S.-A-4,257,299,
and differential springs are used

A method of adjusting the transverse position of an upper blade assembly (16) of a web
slitting machine relative to a lower knife (22) of said web slitting machine, comprising the

steps of:

(a) providing a web slitter having an upper blade assembly interacting with a lower
knife (22) for cutting a moving web of material, said upper blade assembly (16,18)

including a side shifting means for moving a cutting blade (20) into and out of engagement
with said lower knife (22), said side shifting means including spring means (132) for

biasing said side shifting means towards a non-engaged position, said side shifting means
further including pneumatic actuating means (128, 130) for urging said side shifting means

to engage said cutting blade (20) with said lower knife (22);
(b) lowering said cutting blade portion (20) of said machine from a retracted position to
a depth suitable for engaging said lower knife;
(c) actuating side shifting means (128, 130) in said machine to shift said blade (20)
transversely toward said knife (22) for a distance of half of its normal stroke;
(d) moving said upper blade assembly (16) along a transverse support member (14)
until an edge of said blade (20) makes contact with said knife (22); and
(e) tightening said upper blade assembly (16) to said transverse support member,
