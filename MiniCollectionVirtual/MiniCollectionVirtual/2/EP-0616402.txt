<ABSTRACT>
A busbar assembly (10) which is used for phase-by-phase connection of switch poles of the same phase, of switching devices, in an electrical service distribution board, has a multi-chamber insulating profile (11) into whose chambers (12, 13, 14) (which have a U-shaped cross-section) in each case one electrical busbar (31, 25, 35) is inserted. The electrical busbars (31, 25, 35) have lugs (26, 27, 28; 32, 33, 34; 36, 37, 38) which project out of the multi-chamber insulating profile (11) and can be connected to the switching devices. In order to enlarge the separations, especially the tracking paths (leakage paths) between the busbars (31, 25, 35), two of the chambers (12, 14) (first chambers 12, 14) are open in one direction and the second chamber (13) located in between is open in the opposite direction, the first chambers (12, 14) which are open in one direction holding between them the second chamber (13) which is open in the opposite direction. The lugs of the electrical busbar (25) which is located in the second chamber (13) project through slots (29, 30, 31) in the base section (19) out of the second chamber (13) and point in the same direction as the lugs (32, 33, 34; 36, 37, 38), the free ends of all the lugs being located on one line.

Busbar block for connecting breaker terminals of 
the same phase of switching devices phase-by-phase in an 

electrical distribution board, comprising a multi-chamber 
insulating section, in the cross-sectionally U-shaped 

chambers (12, 13, 14) of which a power busbar (25, 35, 
51) is in each case inserted which exhibits lugs (26, 27, 

28) which protrude from the multi-chamber insulating 
section and can be connected to the breaker terminals, 

the partitions between the chambers (12, 13, 14) being 
constructed in such a manner that they keep the power 

busbars (25, 35, 51) spaced apart, characterized in that 
in each case two first chambers (12, 14), open in a first 

direction extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal 
extent of the busbar block, take between themselves a 

second chamber (13) open in the opposite second 
direction, and in that the second chamber (13) exhibits 

at its chamber bottom pointing in the first direction 
slots (29, 30, 31) through which lugs (26, 27, 28) of the 

busbar (25) inserted into the second chamber (13) reach. 
Busbar block according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at the inside surfaces, pointing towards one 

another, of the legs (17, 18) of the second chamber in 
each case there is provided at least one spacing strip 

(21a, 22; 23, 24), which are laterally in contact with 
the busbar (25) and press against it. 
Busbar block according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the bottom sections of the first chambers 

(12, 14) adjoin the free edge of each leg (17, 18) of the 
second chamber (13). 
Busbar block according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that in each case one spacing 
strip (22, 23) is moulded on the free end of each leg 

(17, 18), approximately extending the bottom section of 
the first chambers (12, 14). 
Busbar block according to Claim 2 or 4, characterized 
in that the spacing strips (21a, 22; 23, 24) form 

an acute angle, which is open towards the bottom section 
(19), with the adjacent inside surface. 
Busbar block according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bottom section (19) of 

the second chamber (13) is constructed to be V-shaped 
with bottom areas (20, 21) extending at an obtuse angle 

obliquely to the legs (17, 18). 
Busbar block according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the slots (29, 30, 31) are arranged at the apex 

of the V shape. 
Busbar block according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the strips (21a, 22; 23, 24) extend in 

parallel with the V-shaped bottom areas (20, 21). 
Busbar block according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the free ends of the end 

walls (15, 16) of the first chambers (12, 14) are constructed 
to form a V shape with one another and at the 

same time expanding.
