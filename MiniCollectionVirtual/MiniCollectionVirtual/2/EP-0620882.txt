<ABSTRACT>
Storing means for storing of fresh water, comprising a rock room or a tunnel (20) or a space in the ground made in any other manner. From the tunnel (20) there extend essentially only sidewardly and downwardly directed bores (23, 24, 25) to adjacent crush zones (K) in the rock or other, water holding layers, which bores serve as water inlets and are provided with non return valves, to permit water flow into the tunnel but on in the opposite direction, wherein there to the tunnel or the inlet bores thereof extends one or more members (27) for a preferably continuous check of the chloride content of the stored and/or admitted water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Means for storing of fresh waterThe present invention relates to means for storing o fresh water.The object of the invention has been to provide mean for storing of fresh water by the utilization of which a even temperature and a high quality of the stored water i ensured. Hereby, of course, it is desired that the storin means should be comparatively inexpensive to build and hav a very hughe storing capacity, and that the function thereo should not be noticeable, or preferably not at all, dis turbed by deep hole wells in the vicinity of the storin means .To the just mentioned end the means for storing o fresh water according to the instant invention has bee designed, in principle, in such a manner that essentiall only sidewardly and downwardly directed bores extend fro the tunnel to adjacent crush-zones within the rock or othe water holding layers, which bores serve as water inlets an are provided with nonreturn valves to permit water flow int the tunnel but not in the opposite direction, and such tha there to the tunnel or the inlet bores thereof extend one o several members for a preferably continuous check of th chloride content of the stored and/or admitted water.Preferably the storing means comprises lockable admis sion means for admission of fresh water from an adjacen water flow or an adjacent lake having a good water, whic lake, because of alg flora etc., should not be too shallow.The invention will be disclosed in more details belo with reference had to the accompanying drawing.The drawing illustrates, very diagramatically, a groun portion, generally denoted 10, which in this case is situat ed adjacent to a sea bay 11 having a surface 11A.On the ground portion 10 there is situated a smalle lake 12, having a surface 12A. The ground water within th ground portion 10 has set itself on a level GN, the absolut height above the level of the sea surface HY varies slight ly, as is usual. 

 In the example in the drawing there exists a couple o measure h and x, from which h is the ground water heigh above the sea surface HY, and x is the height of an imagine salt water column which results in satisfaction of th following equation, viz.:0,99 (h + x) = l,0059xHere 0,99 is the density of the fresh water in a give case, whereas the density of the salt water, in the same case, amounts to 1,0059.The dashed line G denotes a transient zone betwee fresh water and salt water, where the just recited equatio is satisfied.In an as solid and tight rock portion as possible within the ground portion 10 a storing

 Claims.
1. Storing means for storing of fresh water, comprising a rock room or a tunnel (20) or a space in the ground made in any other manner, characterized in that there from the tunnel (20) extend essentially only sidewardly and downward¬ ly directed bores (23, 24, 25) to adjacent crush zones (K) in the rock or other, water holding layers, which bores serve as water inlets and are provided with nonreturn val¬ ves, to permit water flow into the tunnel but not in the opposite direction, and in that there to the tunnel or the inlet bores thereof extends one or more members (27) for a preferably continuous check of the chloride content of the stored and/or admitted water.
2. A storing means as claimed in claim 1, characteriz¬ ed in that the tunnel (20) is separated from a remaining unload tunnel (21) by means of a tight, preferably openable partition wall (22).
3. A storing means as claimed in claim 1 or 2 , charac¬ terized in that the storing means comprises lockable inlet means for admission of fresh water from an adjacent water flow or an adjacent lake having a good water.
