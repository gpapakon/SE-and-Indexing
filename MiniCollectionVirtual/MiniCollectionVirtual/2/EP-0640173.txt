<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns filters or traps that remove particulates from 
the exhaust of diesel engines and is particularly concerned with traps containing 
perforated hollow tubes, each of which is wound with heat-resistant yarn to 
provide the filtering element. WO 92/17689 (Bloom) discloses a diesel 
particulate trap having a casing containing at least one perforated hollow tube 
which is helically cross-wound with a heat-resistant yarn (e.g., resistant to 
temperatures above about 600°C) that has a core from which filaments or fiber 
segments project outwardly. The core of each convolution of the yarn is radially 
aligned with the core of an underlying convolution to form walls that are spaced 
to define four-sided openings. The projecting fiber segments intermesh across 
each opening. Means for blocking spaces at the ends of the casing require exhaust 
entering an unblocked space at one end of the casing to pass generally radially 
through the four-sided openings, thus allowing the intermeshed filaments or fiber 
segments to trap soot or particulate carried by the exhaust. Diesel particulate traps 
illustrated in WO-92/17689 have several tubes that either are concentric or 
in a side-by-side arrangement. Because of the high temperatures at which accumulated soot is 
periodically burned off, the yarn should be ceramic, and preferably continuous-filament, 
ply-twisted ceramic yarn to afford sufficient strength to allow the yarn 
to be wound tightly to stay in place against the force of the exhaust. A 
continuous-filament, ply-twisted yarn can be texturized to cause loops of 
continuous filaments to project outwardly without substantial breakage of 
filaments. Especially useful are continuous-filament ceramic yarns of aluminaboria-silica 
fibers available commercially under the trade designation "NEXTEL 
312 CERAMIC YARN" or "NEXTEL 440 CERAMIC YARN" from the 3M 
Company of St. Paul, MN. A diesel particulate trap as per the Bloom application 
made with texturized ceramic yarn should be at least as efficient and durable as 
any known diesel particulate trap, but because of the high cost of the ceramic 
yarn, it may be thought to be too expensive for general use.  
 The invention provides a diesel particulate trap which can be made 
using substantially less yarn than required to make a trap of equal efficiency based 
on the Bloom application. Hence, the novel trap provides economies both in cost 
of raw material and in reduced time to wind the yarn onto perforated tubes. 
Furthermore the invention provides
