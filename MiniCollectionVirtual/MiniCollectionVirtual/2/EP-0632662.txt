<ABSTRACT>
Video encoder and decoder, provided with a motion compensator for 
motion-compensated video coding or decoding in which a picture is coded or decoded in 

blocks in alternately horizontal and vertical steps. The motion compensator is provided 
with addressing means (160) and controlled multiplexers (111-119) for refreshing a 

search area memory (101-109) at each step, in conformity with the direction of the step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a video encoder for blockwise encoding motion-compensated 
video images, provided with a motion compensator comprising a search 
area memory for storing a plurality of contiguous blocks of pixels of a prediction 
image. The invention also relates to a video decoder for deciding video images. In digital coding of television pictures a high degree of compression is the 
general aim in order to limit the quantity of data as much as possible without any loss 
of picture quality. To this end the picture to be encoded is divided into blocks of, for 
example 8*8 pixels. These blocks are subsequently subjected to, for example picture 
transform and variable-length coding. A high degree of compression is achieved by 
means of interframe or interfield coding. In this mode not every individual frame or 
field is encoded but the difference between the current frame or field and its prediction 
is coded. The article "Digitale Bildcodierung, Bewegungskompensierte Interframe-DPCM", 
FKT 6/1992, pp. 416-424 describes that a still higher degree of compression 
is achieved if the prediction image is compensated with respect to motion. For each 
block of the current picture a block of the prediction image corresponding as much as 
possible to this picture is searched. This operation is also referred to as block matching. 
The relative coordinates of the block found with respect to the current block constitute a 
motion vector which is coded and transmitted. The circuit which searches and supplies corresponding blocks of the 
current picture in the prediction image is referred to as motion compensator. Generally, 
the motion compensator compares each block of the current picture only with data in 
the neighbourhood of the corresponding block of the prediction image. The search area 
has a size of 3*3 blocks, i.e. 24*24 pixels. A significant problem in the implementation of motion compensators is 
the organization of the search area memory. On the one hand, the possibility of random 
access to the stored pixels is necessary for the block-matching operation. On the other  
 
hand, provisions are necessary for forming a new search area after each block-matching 
operation. This operation of forming a new search area will hereinafter be referred to as 
refreshing of the search area. The motion compensators hitherto known process the 
picture generally in "stripes". As is shown in Fig. 1, the blocks of the current picture 
are scanned from left to right. Such a fixed scanning sequence renders the

determining a scanning sequence in which the blocks of pixels of the video image are 

encoded, and in that the motion compensator further comprises: 
   addressing means (160) for applying blocks of pixels of the prediction image to 

the search area memory in dependence upon the scanning sequence; 
   control means (111-119) for moving, in dependence upon the scanning

signal step-wise representing the scanning sequence direction.
