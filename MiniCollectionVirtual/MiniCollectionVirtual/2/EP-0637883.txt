<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a carrier recovery 
(CR) circuit for recovering carriers from offset quadrature 

phase shift keying (O-QPSK) modulated carriers, in which 
each of two orthogonal sequences of burst signals, to be 

modulated by the O-QPSK system, has a preamble field set 
in a prescribed bit pattern. In a Costas loop for 

recovering carriers by the QPSK system, a 1/2 symbol delay 
circuit (14) makes the phases of burst signals inputted to 

two orthogonal channels identical to each other. A phase 
comparator (19) for the bit timing recovery field adds with 

an adder (193) a detected carrier value detected by an arc 
tangent calculating circuit (191) and a value resulting 

from the delaying of the detected carrier value with a 
one-symbol delay circuit (192), and supplies the added 

detected carrier value. A switching circuit (22) switches 
and supplies the outputs of phase comparators (18 to 20), 

and enters the output into a loop filter (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier recovery
(CR) circuit, and more particularly to a CR circuit for
offset quadrature phase shift keying (O-QPSK) modulators
in which the preamble field of two sequences of burst
signals, which undergo quadrature modulation by the O-QPSK
system, is set in a prescribed bit pattern.Both the O-QPSK system and the quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK) system are digital signal modulating systems
having the common feature that two carriers of two series
of binary digits, differing in phase from each other by 90°,
undergo two-phase modulation to generate two modulated
carriers in an orthogonal relationship to each other, and
four-phase modulated carriers, resulting from the addition
of the modulated carriers to the initial two carriers,
are sent out to the transmission path, but there is the
difference between them, as illustrated in FIG. 2, in the
phase relationship between the two series of binary digits.Thus, while the phase transition of binary digits
(data) of two series on the in-phase channel (I-channel)
and the quadrature channel (Q-channel) occur at the same
time in the QPSK system as shown in FIG. 2 (A), those of
data of two series on the I-channel and the Q-channel in 
the O-QPSK system arise in the middle of each other's data
transmission periods.Since 180° phase transition doesn't occur in the
O-QPSK system as a result, there arises an effect to
suppress the envelope fluctuations of modulated carriers
which means less susceptibility to non-linear distortions
from a non-linear transmission path. Therefore, in a
system having inevitable non-linear characteristics on
the transmission path sucK as a satellite communication
system, the O-QPSK system has an advantage over the QPSK
system, and accordingly is Msed more frequently in satellite
communication systems.In a satellite communication system using Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA), signals are transmitted in the
form of a succession of short-duration bursts, so that
the burst signals can be efficiently demodulated in a
short demodulator signal acquisition time, they have a
bit structure that a preamble field 300 consisting of a
Carrier Recovery field (CR field) 301 and an ensuing Bit
Timing Recovery field (BTR field) 302 precedes a Unique
Word (UW) 303 at the top of a data field 304 as shown in
Fig. 3. In the CR field 301 and the BTR field 302, fixed
bit patterns are set for the carrier recovery and bit
timing recovery, respectively.It is well known that, in a satellite communication
system based on the
