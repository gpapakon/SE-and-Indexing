<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA sequences, that
contain the coding region of an oligosaccharide
transporter, whose introduction in a plant genome modifies
the formation and transfer of storage materials in
transgenic plants, plasmids, bacteria and plants
containing these DNA sequences, a process for the
preparation and transformation of yeast strains, that
makes possible the identification of the DNA sequences of
the plant oligosaccharide transportcr cf the invention, as
well as the use of DNA sequences of the invention.The most important transport metabolite for stored energy
in many plants, for example potatoes, is sucrose. In other
species, other oligosaccharides can serve this role. In
japanese artichokes for example it is stachyose.The central position of the oligosaccharide transport in
the energy content of the plant has already been shown in
transgenic plants, in which by expression of an invertase,
the sucrose is split into the monosaccharides, leading to
considerable changes in its habit (EP 442 592). Because of
the significance of sucrose in the formation of storage
materials, numerous experiments have been carried out into
investigating the biosynthesis or the metabolism of
disaccharides. From DE 42 13 444, it is known that the
improvement of the storage properties of the harvested
parts can be achieved in transgenic potatoes, in which 
through expression of an apoplastic invertase, the
transfer of energy rich compounds to the heterotrophic
parts of growing shoots is inhibited.In spite of much effort, the mechanism for distributing
storage materials, such as oligosaccharides in plants has
not been clarified and, in order to influence it, it is
not yet known, how the sucrose formed in the leaves
following photosynthesis, reaches the transport channels
of the phloem of the plant and how it is taken up from the
storage organs, e.g. the tubers of potato plants or seeds.
On isolated plasma membranes of cells of leaf tissue of
sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) it has been demonstrated that
the transport of sucrose through the membrane can be
induced by providing an artificial pH gradient and can be
intensified by providing an electrochemical potential
(Lemoine & Delrot (1989) FEBS letters 249: 129-133). The
membrane passage of sucrose follows a Michaelis-Menten
kinetic, in which the km value of the sucrose transport is
around 1 mM (Slone & Buckhout, 1991, Planta 183: 484-589).
This form of kinetic indicates the involvement of
transporter protein. Experiments on plasma membranes of
sugar beet,
