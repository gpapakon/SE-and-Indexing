<ABSTRACT>
Palau'amine, of formula I below, may be isolated 
from a sponge (Stylotella agminata). The compound may 

be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical 
compositions for the treatment of tumors, fungal 

infections and immunosuppressive affections.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an active compound, having
cytotoxic and other properties, which has been isolated
from a Pacific sponge.Guanidine is a familiar structural feature in marine
natural products. Examples range from simple arginine
derivatives to complex polycycles as, e.g., saxitoxin
and tetrodotoxin. We have now isolated and identified a
hexacyclic bisguanidine, hereinafter referred to as
palau'amine, from a sponge Stylotella agminata,
collected in the Western Caroline Islands. Aqueous
extracts of the sponge, first collected in 1977, and
recollected in November 1991 at a depth of -5 to -50 m
near Wonder Channel and Rock Islands, Republic of Belau,
had substantial activity against Gram-negative and
Gram-positive organisms and showed remarkable resistance
to fungal growth on prolonged storage.According to the invention, therefore, there is
provided palau'amine of the formula: 

in the form an addition salt thereof.The antitumor activities of this compound have been
determined "in vitro" in cell cultures of human lung
carcinoma A-549 and human colon carcinoma HT-29. The
procedure was carried out using the methodology
described by Raymond J. Bergeron et al. Biochem.Bioph.
Res. Comm. 1984, 121(3), 848-854 and by Alan C.
Schroeder et al. J. Med. Chem. 1981, 24 1078-1083. The
compound also shows antibiotic and antifungal activity.Therefore, the present invention also provides a
method of treating any mammal affected by a malignant
tumor sensitive to compounds above described, which
comprises administering to the affected individual a
therapeutically effective amount of these compounds or a
pharmaceutically composition thereof; and a method of 
treating fungal infections in mammals, comprising
administering to a patient in need of such treatment, an
antifungal effective amount of the compounds described
in the present invention; and a method of treating
mammals in order to avoid immune response with an
effective amount of the compounds described in the
present invention.The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical
preparations which contain as active ingredient a salt
of palan'amine as well as the process for its
preparation.Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any
solid (tablets, pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or
liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) suitable
composition for oral, topical or parenteral
administration, and they may contain the pure compound
or in combination with any carrier or other
phramcologically active compounds. These compositions
may need to be sterile
