<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT] The present invention cools a plurality of 

battery units uniformly. 
[CONSTITUTION] In an electric vehicle provided with a 

longitudinal, hollow main frame (3) provided with a 
plurality of branching ducts (40) branching from the 

main frame (3) to distribute cooling air to the battery 
units, a plurality of battery units arranged along the 

main frame (3), and a cooling fan connected to one end 
of the main frame (3); the flow passage area of the 

branch duct (40) at a position #1, i.e., the lowest 
position with respect to the direction of flow of the 

cooling air, is smaller than those of the other branch 
ducts (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for
uniformly cooling a plurality of battery units mounted on an
electric vehicle.The applicant of the present patent application
proposed a battery carrying structure previously in EP-A-539 269
with the features of the preamble of claim 1. In this previously
proposed battery carrying structure, a fan sucks fresh air through
the interior of a battery case to cool battery units contained in
the battery case.Since the battery case is formed in an airtight
construction to protect the battery units from mud and water,
and the battery unit generates heat when the same is charged,
the interior of the battery case needs forced cooling. The battery case contains a plurality of battery units.
Branch ducts leading from the hollow frame to the respective
battery units have no different cross-sectional areas. Therefore,
the battery units nearer to the fan and those farther from the fan
are cooled in different degrees, and the battery carrying structure
is unable to cool the plurality of battery units uniformly.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention
to provide a technique capable of uniformly cooling battery units.With the foregoing object in view, the present
invention provides a battery unit cooling system in an electric
vehicle, comprising a longitudinal, hollow frame included in the
electric vehicle, wherein the frame is the longitudinal main frame
of the electric vehicle; a plurality of branch ducts branching from
the frame and connected respectively to a plurality of battery
units arranged along the frame; a cooling fan connected to one
end of the frame to cool the plurality of battery units in a forced-draft
mode or an induced-draft mode; and sealing members
arranged between the branch ducts and the respective battery
units, characterized in that the flow passage area of the branch
duct nearest to the other end of the frame is smaller than those
of the other branch ducts, wherein the flow passage area of the
branch ducts at positions further downstream with respect to the
direction of flow of air through the frame are smaller than those
of the branch ducts at positions further upstream with respect to
the direction of flow of air, wherein the different flow passage
areas are defined by orifices of said sealing members, said
orifices having different cross-sectional areas for determining the
flow rates to the respective battery units. The branch duct farthest from the cooling fan has a
flow passage area smaller than those of the other branch ducts
using

<CLAIMS>
A battery unit cooling system in an electric vehicle (1), comprising:

a longitudinal, hollow frame (3) included in the electric vehicle, wherein
the frame (3) is the longitudinal main frame (3) of the electric vehicle

(1);
a plurality of branch ducts (40, 121) branching from the frame (3) and
connected respectively to a plurality of battery units (35) arranged along

the frame (3);
a cooling fan (30) connected to one end of the frame (3) to cool the
plurality of battery units (35) in a forced-draft mode or an induced-draft

mode; and
sealing members (122, 127) arranged between the branch ducts (40,
121) and the respective battery units (35),

characterized in that the flow passage area (D
1
) of the branch duct (40,
121) nearest to the other end of the frame (3) is smaller than those of

the other branch ducts, wherein the flow passage area (D
1
) of the
branch ducts (40, 121) at positions further downstream with respect to

the direction of flow of air through the frame (3) are smaller than those
(D
2
) of the branch ducts (40, 121) at positions further upstream with
respect to the direction of flow of air, wherein the different flow

passage areas (D
1
, D
2
) are defined by orifices (123, 128) of said sealing
members (122, 127), said orifices (123, 128) having different crosssectional

areas for determining the flow rates (Q1-Q4) to the respective
battery units (35).
