<ABSTRACT>
A pressure measurement system includes a diaphragm (12) and a chamber (30) for exposing one side of the diaphragm to a fluid. A force transducer (14) is provided for measuring force exerted by the fluid on the one side of the diaphragm independent of diaphragm position. A ferromagnetic plate (16) is attached to the diaphragm (12) to enable removable coupling of the diaphragm (12) to a magnet (18) permanently attached to the force transducer (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
pressure measurement system and more particularly is
related to a pressure monitoring system for opthalmic
instruments such as a Phaco instrument for removing
the crystalline lens from an eye.Typically, cataracts, or crystalline
manifestations, in an eye are removed by fragmentation
thereof which may include an ultra-sound driven hollow
needle inserted into the eye through a small incision
in the sclera. Removal of the fragmented lens is
effected through a center hole in the needle and
involves continuous circulation of fluid through the
eye which is provided by the hollow needle inserted
therein.While eye pressure must be carefully maintained
to prevent collapse of the eye chamber, over-pressure
may be necessary at times to remove a blockage in the
hollow needle which may be caused by a fragmented
lens. In addition, fluid flow in the needle may be
reversed to reflux the fluid and dislodge the
fragmented lens from the hollow needle. During this
operation, it is, of course, necessary to monitor and
maintain eye pressure preselected absolute maximum
level.Failure to measure and control fluid pressure
during the removal process may result in the formation
of a large void in the plastic tubing system leading
from the needle to a pump utilized in providing the
fluid circulation. In addition, a sudden release of 
blockage could result in the reduction of pressure in
the eye as the void is filled by the liquid from the
eye which may not be replaced with sufficient speed,
thereby resulting in the collapse of the cornea as
hereinabove pointed out.Conversely, if there is poor control during the
reflux process, a large over-pressure may be generated
in the eye which would cause inflation of the eye when
the blockage breaks free.A number of peristaltic pumps have been developed
for use with Phaco instruments such as described in
U.S. Patent 5230614.Heretofore, pressure measurement systems have
utilized a diaphragm for the isolated measurement of
pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, and have incorporated the
diaphragm in a number of different structural
configurations.First, the diaphragm has been attached to known
spring systems in order to determine the motion of the
diaphragm in response to pneumatic and/or hydraulic
pressure. This is a traditional method of measuring
pressure and is commonly used in many mechanical
gauges and pressure transducers. However, since
unlimited diaphragm motion is not possible, saturation
may occur. This condition effectively puts a maximum
