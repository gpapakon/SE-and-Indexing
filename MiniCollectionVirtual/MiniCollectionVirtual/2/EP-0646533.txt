<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping mechanism for clamping together 
a closure and a body mounting same, characterised by a first member (4) 

mounting a plurality of clamping devices (5), by a second member (6) having 
an over-centre part (7), by the first and second members (4, 5) being in 

engagement, and by the arrangement being such that when the body (3) 
engages the first member (4), the first and second members (4, 6) move over-centre 

and the clamping devices (5), and the second member (6) engage the 
closure (2) whereby to clamp the closure (2) in the body (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clamping mechanism, particularly to such a
mechanism as can be used for clamping a closure such as a cone seal in an
aperture in say a container, hopper, silo, or intermediate bulk container (I.B.C.)
which is used to store and/or transport, or mix, flowable material such as
powder, granulated material or the like.For various reasons such as the need to contain the material so that it does not
cross-contaminate with materials or to ensure that it does not escape to the
ambient atmosphere with possibly detrimental environmental consequences, it is
necessary to try to ensure as good a seal of the cone seal as possible. However,
it has generally proved difficult to ensure that the cone does not become
dislodged or tilted, or leak, during transport or use, particularly as it has to be
borne in mind that the I.B.C, can carry as much as two tonnes or more of
material. In a blender operation, the container is rotated end over end and the
cone can have an extremely high instantaneous component of lateral force on it
when it is in a momentarily horizontal position, and this tends to dislodge the
cone or at best cause it to leak. An example of an apparatus for containing
flowable material is shown in GB-A-2 212 788.It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to obviate these
disadvantages.According to the invention there is provided a clamping mechanism for clamping
together a closure and a body mounting same, comprising
a first member including a plurality of resiliently mounted clamping
devices disposed to contact the closure and which can be moved from a release
position to a clamping position to clamp the closure in the body, anda second member adapted to contact the clamping devices of the first 
member to move them from the release position to the clamping position, and
to maintain the clamping devices in the clamping position.The first member may comprise a means to receive the body and a mount for
the clamping devices, This provides for automatic operation.The means may comprise an annular dish-like member mounting the clamping
devices. This is a relatively simple construction.The dish-like member may have a flared periphery for engagement by the body.The clamping devices may be secured to an inner boundary surface of the dish-like
member by resilient mounting means. This provides for a positive clamping
action.The resilient mounting means may each comprise a leaf spring. This is a
relatively simple yet inexpensive construction.The clamping devices may each comprise a

<CLAIMS>
A clamping mechanism for clamping together a closure (2) and a body
(3) mounting same, characterised by,


a first member (4) including a plurality of resiliently mounted clamping
devices (5) disposed to contact the closure (2) and which can be moved from a

release position to a clamping position to clamp the closure (2) in the body (3),
and
a second member (6) adapted to contact the clamping devices (5) of the
first member (4) to move them from the release position to the clamping

position, and to maintain the clamping devices (5) in the clamping position.
