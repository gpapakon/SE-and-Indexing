<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vortex flow separator which operates with pre-vortex and has a rotationally symmetrical housing (1) or container with internal deflection bell (3) for separating heavy and light impurities, the latter of which being precipitated on the floor of the housing (1), and with a drawing-off device (18) for the heavy impurities at the floor of the housing (1). The invention is characterised in that the deflection bell (3) has a conical cover wall (4) which extends essentially parallel to the cover wall (2) of the housing and is continuous with a planar, coaxially arranged cylinder (5) in the centre of which the lightweight contamination drainage line (6) projects from below with upwardly directed inlet opening (7).

A turbulent flow separator operating with an initial whirl
for treating suspensions of fibrous material, with the

following features:

1.1 the separator comprises a rotationally symmetrical housing
(1);
1.2 the housing (1) is built up from a conical upper wall (2)
with at the top a conical tip and adjacent to which there

is a cylindrical wall (10), and from a conical bottom (12)
adjacent the cylindrical part (10) and having a conical tip

at the bottom;
1.3 in the region of the upper wall (2) there is inside the
housing (1) a deflecting bell (3) which has a likewise

conical upper wall which extends substantially parallel
with the upper wall (2) of the housing and forming an

annular space with this latter;
1.4 in the region of the tip of the upper wall (2) of the
housing is an inlet for the suspension of material which is

to be treated;
1.5 for extracting the purified water from the region of the
deflecting bell there is a pipe (6) which, having an

upwardly directed inlet aperture (7), projects from the
bottom and into the centre of the cylindrical part (10);
1.6 in the region of the bottom (12) is a discharge means (18)
for carrying away the heavy impurities, characterised in

that
1.7 the diameter of the cylindrical part (5) of the
deflecting bell (3) is smaller than the outside diameter of

the housing (1).
A separator according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
conical tip angle a of the deflecting bell (3) is between

146 and 164°.
A separator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the outside diameter of the housing is between 800 and 

1800 mm and the diameter of the cylindrical part (5) of the
deflecting bell (3) is 12 to 20% smaller than the outside

diameter of the housing (1).
A separator according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that a hollow cylindrical part (10) is

likewise adjacent the bottom of the frustoconical part of
the housing and in that the height of the cylindrical part

(5) of the deflecting bell (3) is between 40 and 60% of the
height of the hollow cylindrical part (10) of
 the housing
(1).
A separator according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the discharge means (18) for carrying

away the heavy parts and which is disposed in the bottom
(12, 12') of the housing (1) is a screw conveyor (19, 20).
A separator according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
axis of rotation of the screw conveyor (19) is at an angle

of between 40 and 65° in respect of the horizontal.
A separator according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the pointed outlet part of a

hydrocyclone (41) is disposed at the central inlet aperture
(8) in the top of the housing (1).
A separator according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that a rotary flow inlet member (30) with

its central inlet aperture in its bottom (31) is disposed
at the central inlet aperture (8) in the top of the housing

(1). 
A separator according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
rotary flow inlet member (30) has in its upper wall (32) a

central discharge pipe (34) for light particles.
