<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to analogs of gangliosides, a 
method for preparation of such compounds, use of such compounds 
to induce immune response and as inhibitors of 
adhesion of bacteria and viruses, as well as in the production 
of antibodies against the compounds, antibodies against 
the compounds as well as use of the antibodies in therapy or 
diagnosis. Gangliosides, i.e. sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, 
are well-known components of the mammalian cell surfaces. 
Furthermore, gangliosides have been found to occur in equilibrium 
with the corresponding lactones. Thus, GM3- and GD3-ganglioside 
[NeuAcα(2-3) Galβ (1-4) GlcβO-Ceramide and NeuAcα (2-8)NeuAcα(2-3)Galβ(1-4)GlcβO-Ceramide] 
have been demonstrated 
to form lactones where the sialic acid-derived carbonyl group 
enters into lactone formation with various hydroxyl groups of 
the NeuAc and Gal residues. Furthermore, it has been shown 
that such lactones exist in vivo e.g. in brain tissue and in 
the membranes of tumour cells, and are not just artifacts of 
the isolation procedures (Gross, S. K.; Williams, M. A.; 
McCluer, R. H. J. Neurochem.1980, 34, 1351-1361). It has also 
been shown that GM3-lactone is much more immunogenic than is 
the open form of GM3-ganglioside (Nores, G. A.; Dohi, T.; 
Taniguchi, M.; Hakomori, S.-I. J. Immun. 1987, 139, 3171-3176), 
and that a monoclonal antibody obtained by 
immunisation of mice with melanoma B16 cells had a high 
affinity binding site for GM3-lactone and a low affinity 
binding site for the open form of GM3-ganglioside. Similarly, 
it has been shown (Dohi et al.; Cancer Research 48 (1988) 
5680) that through immunisation of mice with GM3-lactone, a 
hybridoma (designated DH2) was obtained secreting an IgG3 
antibody showing reactivity with GM3 and GM3-lactone with  
 
preference for the lactone form. It has also been demonstrated 
(Ritter et al.; Immunobiol. 182 (19990) 32-43) that 
derivatives of GD3 such as GD3-lactone I, GD3-lactone II, 
GD3-amide, and GD3-gangliosidol all showed an increased 
immunogenicity as compared to unmodified GD3. It has also been suggested that GM3-lactone is a highly rigid 
structure with the lactone ring in a chair-like conformation 
(see scheme 1 below) which would mean that its ability to 
serve as a recognition site or membrane antigen could be 
enhanced, compared to its parent structure, which is flexible 
(Yu, R. K.; Koerner, T. A. W.;  
 Ando, S.; Yohe, H. C.; Prestegaard, J. H. J. Biochem. 1985, 
98, 1367-1373). Furthermore, the lactone of
