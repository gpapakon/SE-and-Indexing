<ABSTRACT>
Copper laminates (3) which have been provided with a black or brown oxide coating (black or brown oxide finish) and which, in the course of a subsequent process step, are to be incorporated into an electrical multilayer are reduced electrochemically in order to prevent the formation of so-called pink rings. To this end, in a suitable electrolyte, they are connected as the cathode of an electrolysis. The atomic hydrogen formed in the nascent state in the process reduces the copper oxide layer on the metallic regions of the copper laminates (3), either in its entirety or in part, the resistance of the surfaces of the metallic regions of the copper laminate with respect to a subsequent attack by acid being considerably improved as a result. The electrochemical reduction may, if required, be coupled with a chemical reduction or be carried out prior to a chemical reduction.

A process for the production of multilayers wherein
the copper oxide on the metallic zones of black- or brown-oxidized

copper laminates is at least partially reduced
prior to the integration of said laminates into the

multilayers to avoid the formation of pink rings,

hydrogen which forms "in statu nascendi" directly on the
copper laminates in that in a suitable electrolyte the

copper laminates (3) are connected as cathode of an
electrolysis system.

diluted NaOH is used as electrolyte.

characterised in that the current density during the

electrolysis is maintained at between 1 and 500, preferably

20 and 250 mA/cm
