<ABSTRACT>
The heat transmission efficiencies of boilers are being constantly improved. The improvement of these efficiencies, however, also requires an increase in the flow resistances, so that the pressure figures of blowers also have to be improved. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a radial blower, in particular for blower-type burners, which operates with a very steep characteristic, i.e. with a pressure figure greater than 6. According to the invention, this object is achieved by a radial blower (1) whose inlet nozzle (3) is offset with respect to the wheel axis (8) in such a way that, starting approximately at the end of the second quadrant and reaching into the region of the housing tongue (10), between the wheel (6) and the drawn-in wall (15) of the inlet nozzle (3), there is formed a crescent-shaped lateral channel (17) which passes out of the diffuser-like spiral housing into the wheel interior (18).
