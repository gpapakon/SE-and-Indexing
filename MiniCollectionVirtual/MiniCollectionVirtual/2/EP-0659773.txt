<ABSTRACT>
A gas phase process for producing polyethylene containing long chain 

branches is disclosed and claimed. The polymerization process involves 
contacting ethylene under polymerization conditions in the gas phase and 

at a temperature above 65°C, with a catalyst composition which includes a) 
at least one bridged metallocene having at least two cyclic pi-bonded 

moieties in association with a metal atom, the cyclic pi-bonded moieties 
being joined together via a bridging linkage one or two atoms long, and b) 

an activating cocatalyst; the catalyst composition being effective to result in 
incorporation of an average of up to 3 long chain branches per 1000 carbon 

atoms in the main polyethylene chain.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyolefin manufacturing, and more particularly, to a gas phase process for introducing
relatively long chain branches into polyethylene chains.High density polyethylene becomes flexible and tough with the addition of short chain branches onto the otherwise
linear backbone. Introduction of such branching also reduces the polymer's density. Polyethylene containing long chain
branches also possesses good strength, and in addition, offers significant processing advantages in that 1) its viscosity
under conditions of high shear is relatively low, permitting high processing rates under reasonable operating conditions,
and 2) it often exhibits strain hardening, meaning that under conditions of high strain its viscosity increases, so that
products made from polyethylene containing long chain branches, such as films, tend not to fail as they are being
manufactured. Strain hardening is believed to be caused by intermolecular entanglements which lengthen the relaxation
time of a polymer melt subjected to strain. Polymers that show strain hardening are better suited to certain types
of extrusion apparatus than those that do not.Branched polyethylene typically has been produced industrially by adding 1-butene or 1-hexene comonomer to
the polymerization reactor and copolymerizing the comonomer with ethylene. There have also been reports of introducing
branching into polyethylene without adding comonomers to the reaction mixture, by employing catalyst systems
and reaction conditions that simultaneously form vinyl-terminated (terminally unsaturated) low molecular weight polymer
molecules from ethylene monomer and copolymerize these with ethylene monomer to form the desired branched
polyethylenes. See, for example, European Patent Application No. 443,686; E. A. Benham, et al., Polymer Engineering
and Science,28, 1469-1472 (1988); Beach and Kissin, J. Polymer Science,22, 3027-3042 (1984); and C. Denger, et
al., Makromol. Chem., Rapid Commun., 12, 697-701 (1991).PCT Application No. WO 93/08221 of Dow describes manufacture of olefin polymers having long chain branching
as opposed to the relatively short chain branching of the prior art, using certain constrained geometry metallocene
catalysts that form relatively long vinyl-terminated hydrocarbon chains and copolymerize these with olefin monomer
to form the desired branched polymers. This disclosure is limited, however, to liquid phase polymerizations using the
particular catalysts disclosed. Although the Dow application states that it should be
