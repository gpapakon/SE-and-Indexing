<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst
component for use in the polymerization of α-olefins.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a
catalyst component, which makes possible the production
of α-olefin polymers having a high melting point, a
catalyst for the polymerization of α-olefins using said
catalyst component, and a process for producing α-olefin
polymers using said catalyst.A so-called Kaminsky catalyst has been well known as
a homogeneous catalyst for the polymerization of olefins.
This catalyst is characterized in that it has a very high
catalytic activity for the polymerization and can provide
a polymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution.As transition metal compounds useful for the
production of isotactic polyolefins by Kaminsky catalyst,
ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride and
ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium
dichloride (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.
130314/1986) have been known. They, however, have
disadvantages including that the resultant polyolefins
have a low molecular weight and polymerization at a low
temperature can provide high-molecular weight polyolefins
only at the sacrifice of the polymerization activity of
the catalyst. Further, it has been known that a high-molecular
weight polymer can be produced when a hafnium
compound is used instead of zirconium as a transition
metal compound (Journal of Molecular Catalysis, 56 (1989)
p. 237-247). However, this method may, to the best of
our knowledge, have a shortcoming in that the
polymerization activity is low. Furthermore, dimethylsilylbis-substituted
cyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and the like are
proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.
301704/1989, Polymer Preprints, Japan Vol. 39, No. 6, p.
1614-1616 (1990) and Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. 12406/1991, and
dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride and the
like are proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication Nos. 295007/1988 and 275609/1989. These
proposals may have made possible the production of
polymers having a high stereoregularity and a high
melting point by polymerization at relatively low
temperatures. To the best of our knowledge, however, a
lowering in the stereoregularity, melting point and
molecular weight of the polymers would be significant
when the polymerization is carried out under high
temperature conditions that are favorable from the
viewpoint of economy.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos.
268307/1992 and 268308/1992 suggest that the
stereoregularity and
