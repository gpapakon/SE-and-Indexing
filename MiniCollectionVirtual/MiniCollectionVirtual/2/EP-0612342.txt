<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydrophilic pressure-sensitive 
adhesive composition formed from the mixture of a solid, 
radiation-crosslinked poly(N-vinyl lactam) and an essentially 
unirradiated plasticizer. This invention also relates to a method 
for producing the composition by radiation-crosslinking solid 
poly(N-vinyl lactam) and mixing the radiation-crosslinked poly(N-vinyl 
lactam) with a plasticizer to render a cohesive, swellable, 
and pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. Many medical adhesives are known. Often, these 
adhesives are copolymers of hydrophobic water-insoluble monomers 
such as isooctyl acrylate and a small amount of a water-soluble 
monomer such as a short chain α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid or an 
N-vinyl lactam. While these copolymers make excellent medical 
adhesives, the presence of substantial amounts of ionic or highly 
polar solvents results in phase separation. Conductive adhesives have been known for many years. 
One class of conductive adhesives has employed homopolymers or 
copolymers of N-vinyl lactams such as N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone. U.S. 
Pat. Nos. 4,273,135 and 4,352,359 (both Larimore et al.) disclose 
non-ionic water-soluble polymers prepared from N-vinyl lactams. 
However, no crosslinking of such polymers is disclosed. 
Crosslinking allows for higher amounts of a plasticizer for the 
composition without reducing cohesiveness of the composition below 
acceptable levels. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,527,087 and 4,539,996 (both Engel) 
disclose the polymerization of an unsaturated free-radically 
polymerizable material which is soluble in a polyhydric alcohol, 
where the unsaturated material is crosslinked with a multifunctional 
unsaturated free-radically polymerizable material. U.S. Pat. No. 
4,554,924 (Engel) discloses a conductive adhesive formed by an 
essentially solventless free-radical polymerization of an adhesive 
precursor having a polyhydric alcohol, at least one non-ionic 
monomer, an initiator, a crosslinker, and an ionizable salt present 
in amounts sufficient to render the composition electrically 
conductive. One of the non-ionic free-radically polymerizable 
monomers can be N-vinyl pyrrolidone. The essentially solventless 
precursor can be coated onto the electrode plate or transfer sheet  
 
and exposed to either heat or actinic radiation which forms the 
electrically conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive. The precursor 
may also be exposed to electron beam radiation to facilitate the 
crosslinking. U.S. Pat. No. 4,848,353 (Engel) discloses an 
electrical
