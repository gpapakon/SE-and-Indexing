<ABSTRACT>
A self-injection device has a tubular sleeve (1) in which is axially arranged an ampule (5) closed at its front end by a membrane (6) and at its rear end by a piston (8). An injection cannula (3) is axially slidable in the ampule. A tubular actuating cap (13) is slidably guided on the rear end (4) of the sleeve (1) and is secured against removal. A piston rod (16) which acts on the piston (8) starts from the bottom (17) of the cap (13) and is inserted into the sleeve. A central bore (18) extends through the bottom of the cap and the piston rod. A locking pin (19) is inserted into the bore (18) in the initial position, in which the cap is partially slid on the sleeve and the piston rod engages the piston. At its inserted end, the locking pin (19) has radially projecting elastic tongues (20) which extend through lateral slots (21) in the piston rod and bear on the rear end (22) of the sleeve.
