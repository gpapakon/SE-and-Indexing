<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a flexible shower or protection cubicle which is movable from a closed position bounding the shower or protection space into an opened position, provision is made for a flexible curtain (2) which is foldable in the form of bellows in the vertical direction and is to be opened upwards and closed downwards and which, in plan view, has a curved, substantially U-shaped or horseshoe-shaped cross-section. The curtain is arranged to be vertically movable in two vertical guiding devices (4, 5) fixed to the wall, is guided parallel to the floor and is capable of being raised. The raised curtain is arranged in an overhead surround (3) in such a way that it can be fastened or stowed.
