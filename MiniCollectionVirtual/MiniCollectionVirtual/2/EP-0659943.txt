<ABSTRACT>
An excavating apparatus for excavating a ditch in the 
ground, the apparatus including a vehicle (2) and a cutter 

(22), the cutter being attached slidably to upper and lower 
horizontal guides (7,8) mounted on the vehicle, and having 

upper and lower hydraulic cylinders (16,18) to move the 
cutter (22) relative to the upper and lower horizontal 

guides (7,8). If the angle of the cutter (22) inclines 
from the vertical it can be corrected by means of the upper 

and lower hydraulic cylinders (16,18). During the 
excavation of a ditch the cutter (22) is driven forward by 

the hydraulic cylinders (16,18) with the vehicle (2) 
stationary with the result that an accurate ditch can be 

excavated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
excavating a ditch in the ground for use when constructing 
an underground continuous wall in civil engineering works. Previously, in order to construct an underground 
continuous wall, it was necessary to excavate an elliptical 
hole, 2 or 3m (6 or 10 feet) wide, down to a predetermined 
depth from the ground surface, or to drill into the ground 
with an auger drill with double or triple lanes down to a 
predetermined depth, and then to insert a reinforcement 
cage or steel members. Finally, cement was poured into the 
hole, or ready mixed concrete was cast in the hole. By 
repeating this process with successive holes intercepting 
preceding ones, a continuous underground wall could be 
constructed. In the prior method for constructing an underground 
continuous wall described above, there are some problems as 
follows. Since the machinery for excavating the holes is 
about 30m (100 feet) tall, there is a danger that it may 
fall over. Secondly, the construction process is 
complicated, so the construction period is prolonged. 
Also, a film of muddy water, bentonite or the like is 
formed where one hole intercepts the preceding section of 
wall, so a perfect joint cannot be made in order to form a 
continuous wall. Underground water may leak through the  
 
joints after completion of the works. It is therefore 
difficult to attain simultaneously the objectives of safely 
and rapidly constructing a wall in the ground which is also 
perfectly continuous. Because of these problems, a method of making an 
underground continuous wall as shown in the schematic views 
of Figs. 4 and 5 has been tried. In this method an endless 
chain type cutter c is disposed on one side of a self-propelled 
vehicle b having a crawler track a. A continuous 
ditch is excavated in the ground by advancing the self-propelled 
vehicle b in the direction of the arrow A of 
Figs.4 and 5 while driving the cutter c. Then concrete or 
cement is poured into the ditch. However, in use of the above-mentioned apparatus shown 
in Figs.4 and 5, problems can arise if the resistance to 
excavation of the ground is great. Firstly, the endless 
chain type cutter c inclines from the vertical as shown in 
Fig.6. This means the ditch is not properly formed. Also, 
the crawler a₁ on the side of the vehicle b at which the 
cutter c is located is delayed, and the crawler a₂ on the 
opposite side advances and the vehicle b turns as a whole, 
as shown by the arrow B in Fig. 7. It is the aim of the
