<ABSTRACT>
A non-invasive apparatus for obtaining a quantitative determination of mean left atrial pressure comprises a balloon (24) to be inserted by means of a catheter (20) into the esophagus (26) and positioned adjacent the left atrium. As the balloon is gradually inflated, a tracing of mean balloon pressure is obtained. In addition, a tracing of balloon pressure on a steady baseline and with low frequency oscillations due to respiration filtered out is obtained whereby the tracing represents balloon pressure oscillations effected by left atrial pressure. In accordance with the oscillometric principle the mean balloon pressure is measured at the time when the amplitude of the balloon pressure oscillations effected by the left atrial pressure is at a peak. This mean balloon pressure is indicative of approximate mean left atrial pressure. Mean left atrial transmural pressure may be determined by subtracting therefrom the mean esophageal pressure as measured at a position in the esophagus where it is unaffected by the heart.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the measurement of blood
pressure and, more specifically, to the determination of mean left atrial blood
pressure. Many invasive methods of determining mean left atrial pressure
are known, but the invention aims to provide a less invasive technique
(without requiring puncturing of an artery) for monitoring mean left atrial
pressure.US-A-4,409,986 discloses an esophageal cardiac pulse probe for
monitoring cardiac pulse wave forms. The apparatus is intended for
monitoring sounds from the heart and lungs, but is not disclosed as being
suitable for measuring mean left atrial pressure. The apparatus comprises a sensing probe
including and inflatable balloon, means for inserting said sensing probe into an esophogus,
and inflation means for inflating said ballon and means for measuring the balloon pressure.The invention provides apparatus as set out in Claim 1,Thus, the 
invention seeks to non-invasively and easily obtain a
determination of a person's mean left atrial
transmural pressure.In order to non-invasively determine a person's
mean left atrial pressure safely, accurately, and
reliably, in accordance with the present invention a
balloon is inserted into the person's esophagus and
positioned adjacent the left atrium and inflated,
and the mean balloon pressure is measured when the
amplitude of balloon pressure oscillations effected
by the left atrial pressure is at a peak. This peak
amplitude is indicative of resonating of the balloon
pressure at a pressure effected by the person's mean
left atrial pressure, in accordance with the
oscillometric principle. This pressure is thus
determinative approximately of mean left atrial
pressure. The mean left atrial transmural pressure
may be determined by subtracting therefrom the
pleural pressure, i.e., the pressure on the outside
of the heart. It is envisioned that further
refinements of this method may lead to the ability
to determine other left atrial pressure values such
as diastolic and systolic left atrial pressures or
other pressures associated therewith.The above and other aims, features, and
advantages of the present invention will be apparent
in the following description, provided purely by way of
example, when read in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings in which like reference
numerals denote the same or similar parts throughout
the several views.In the drawings:-

and said determining means (56) is adapted to filter the balloon pressure and
provide an output indicating the amplitude of oscillations effected by the left atrial
