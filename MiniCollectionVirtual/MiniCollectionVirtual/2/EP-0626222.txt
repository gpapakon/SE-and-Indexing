<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and 
an apparatus for forming a rectangular 

collar at the end of a pipe (34) by 
shaping it by means of a forming element 

(1) which is moved in the axial direction 
of the pipe towards the pipe and rotated 

along the interior surface of the pipe 
end about the longitudinal axis of the 

pipe. The forming cone (1) is moved in 
the axial direction of the pipe towards 

the pipe so that, as it moves towards the 
pipe, the forming element (1) is automatically 

turned from an initial position 
to a final position by the thrust producing 

the movement, simultaneously forming 
the pipe end so as to produce a collar 

substantially rectangular with respect to 
the direction of the longitudinal axis of 

the pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure and an 
apparatus for forming a rectangular collar at the end of a 
pipe according to the preamble of claim 1 and claim 4, 
respectively. The invention concerns in the first place the making of a 
collar at the end of pipes made of steel or other metals, 
said pipes often having a diameter of several hundred millimetres 
and a wall thickness of several millimetres. For 
joining pipes together, a possible alternative is to form 
perpendicular flanges at the ends of the pipes to be joined, 
which are then coupled together. In the case of pipes that 
can be plastically worked up, the flange can be formed by 
suitably shaping the pipe end. However, if the pipe has a 
large diameter and a large wall thickness, a considerable 
force is needed for the shaping operation. Forming a collar 
on a pipe with a diameter of 200 - 400 mm requires a force 
of several thousand kilopond. In this case, the bearing 
elements transmitting the force constitute an important part 
of the functional whole. In a previously known solution (DE Patent 38 05 814), 
a collar at an angle of 35-40° is first formed 
at the pipe end, then the forming cone is replaced or an 
auxiliary forming head is mounted on it, whereupon a final 
rectangular collar is formed. The cone is held by its shaft 
in a chuck rotatably mounted on a frame. In another known 
device, the forming cone can be mounted at different positions 
in the chuck to permit the flanging pipes of different 
sizes. In the known solutions, the forming cone must be 
fitted anew between the first and second stages of the 
operation, and the cone is only supported by one end. 
Moreover, a separate fit is needed for each pipe size. There is also another previously known solution (FI application 
no. 921627), in which a conical collar is first produced  
 
and the forming element is then moved in the axial 
direction of the pipe away from the pipe and turned so that 
its forming surface is substantially perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe, whereupon a rectangular 
collar is formed in a manner known in itself by moving the 
forming element in the axial direction of the pipe towards 
the pipe and rotating the forming element along the edge of 
the pipe end. The apparatus used in this solution is provided 
with means for turning the forming element about its 
fulcrum to a first position, in which the surface of the 
forming element is at an acute angle to the longitudinal 
axis of the pipe and the forming element is supported

Procedure for forming a substantially rectangular collar 
at the end of a pipe (34) by placing a forming element (1) 

against the pipe end and moving it in the axial direction of 
the pipe towards the pipe (34), the forming element (1) 

being rotated along the interior surface (46) of the pipe 
end about the longitudinal axis of the pipe, characterized 

in that the forming element (1) is moved in the axial 
direction of the pipe towards the pipe so that, as it moves 

towards the pipe, the forming element (1) is automatically 
turned from an initial position to a final position by the 

thrust producing the movement, simultaneously forming the 
pipe end so as to produce a collar substantially rectangular 

with respect to the direction of the longitudinal axis of 
the pipe. 
Procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that, 
prior to the collaring operation, the distance of the 

forming element (1) from the longitudinal axis of the pipe 
(34) is adjusted to a value corresponding to the diameter of 

the pipe. 
Procedure according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
forming element (1) is locked in position at the set distance. 
Apparatus for forming a substantially rectangular collar 
at the end of a pipe, said apparatus comprising a forming 

element (1) rotatably mounted on its supporting axle (2) and 
a stock (30) which supports the forming element (1) either 

directly or indirectly and which can be moved with respect 
to the pipe (34) in the direction of its longitudinal axis 

so as to bring the surface of the forming element (1) into 
contact with the end of the pipe and to permit it to be 

shaped, characterized in that the apparatus is provided with 
a turning unit which accommodates the forming element (1) 

and is so designed that it will turn depending on the forming 
force between an initial position and a final position 

 
during the forming phase. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
turning unit (40) is so designed that it will turn during 

the forming phase along a path having the form of a circular 
arc from an initial position of substantially 45° to the 

final position.
