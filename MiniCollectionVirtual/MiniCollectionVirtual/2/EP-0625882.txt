<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for maintaining an elongated, generally, T-shaped, spar track for a free running of mating slides and boltropes under loadings of a sail through cleaning and maintenance is described. A first internal surface region (64) of the T-shaped track opening (15) is comparatively wider than a second internal surface region (66) of the track opening. The second internal surface region (66) merges with a third external region (68) of the track opening (15). The improvement comprises a compressible, flexible, pliable member (12) for cleaning, lubricating and maintenance of the T-shaped track opening (15). The pliable member (12) is prefolded and united to provide a T-shape corresponding to the shape of the track opening (15). The pliable member (12) comprises a T-shape to facilitate insertion of the pliable member (12) into the track opening (15) and to enbale the pliable member (12) to be in slidable engagement with the track opening (15). A control means (42) adjustably shapes the pliable member (12) when inserted within the track opening (15) to cause the pliable member (12) to compress and to substantially correspond to the T-shape of the track opening (15). The inserted pliable member (12) is in slidable engagement with the track opening (15) when subjected to compression through the control means (42), and when being slidably moved to allow the effects of corrosion to be reduced, and thereby, enhance a free running of the slides and boltropes under the loadings.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Description Spar Track Cleaning and Maintenance DeviceThis is a continuation-in-part of an application having U.S. Pat Appli. Ser. No.07/623,692, filed December 7, 1990.Technical FieldThis invention generally relates to the cleaning and preventive maintenance of sailboats, and more particularly, to a device for maintaining a spar track for the free running of sail slides and boltropes under sail loadings.Background ArtSails, supporting spars and rigging form a sailboat system for movement and navigation. A spar can generally be defined as a pole or system of poles used to support sails. Spars are used herein to describe other sail supports such as mast, booms, gaffs and headfoils. The handling of sails to allow navigation of the sailboat, particularly the hoisting and lowering of sails, depends on spar tracks or grooves and mating slides, slugs, boltropes and luffropes. Tracks can be generally described as elongated slot-like or channel-like fittings having a T-shaped or bottle-shaped profile and are normally longitudinally ir√∏sitioned on a spar. Slides or slugs are usually interchangeably referred to and may be simply described as fittings that interconnect the sail and the spar track to hold the sail thereto.Similarly, boltropes and luffropes typically function to interconnect and hold the sail to the spar. Boltropes are usually stitched to a bottom edge or foot of a sail, while 

luffropes are typically stitched to a luff edge or forward edge of a sail. Boltropes and luffropes are substantially equivalent to one another, although boltropes normally are used with different types of spars than luffropes. For instance, boltropes are typically used with boom tracks, while luffropes are normally used with mast tracks. Therefore, boltropes will be defined herein to include luffropes.A number of spar tracks are fabricated from metal, metal alloy, or plastic materials. Spar tracks so constructed are designed to mate with boltropes and slides fabricated from non-metallic natural materials or non-metallic synthetic materials. Some spar track and mating slide arrangements are completely made of metal, metal alloy or plastic materials. The metal of popular choice for fabricating spar tracks is aluminum. This choice is dictated in part because of aluminum's great strength, durability, weight and low cost with respect to other marine metals, and because aluminum spars will normally be hollow and comprise extruded aluminum tracks.Slides and boltropes are inserted within the spar tracks through openings therein.
