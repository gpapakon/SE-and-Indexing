<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a lactic ester inexpensively 
by microorganic fermentation of lactic acid with a simple 

apparatus is provided, which method effects adjustment of 
the pH of a culture medium during the course of the 

fermentation with ammonia and, after the end of the 
fermentation, recovers the ammonia for reuse to lower the 

cost required for the fermentation and decrease the amount 
of a by-product of fermentation. 
In a process involving fermentation of lactic acid 
with a microorganism, a method for the production of 
a 
lactic ester which comprises carrying out the adjustment of 

pH of a culture medium undergoing the fermentation of lactic 
acid with ammonia, adding an alcohol having four or five 

carbon atoms to at least one solution selected from the 
group consisting of a solution of ammonium lactate obtained 

by the fermentation, the concentrate of the solution of 
ammonium lactate mentioned above, and the solution resulting 

from separation of solid substances including the 
microorganic cells used for the fermentation from either of 

the solutions and heating the resultant mixture thereby 
inducing dehydration and esterification of lactic acid with 

the alcohol and, at the same time, effecting liberation and 
recovery of ammonia, and adding a mineral acid to the 

solution obtained by the esterification reaction and heating 
and dehydrating the resultant mixture in an acidic state 

thereby promoting and completing the esterification of the 
lactic acid with the alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for the 
production of lactic acid and lactic esters. At present, lactic acid is used as a food additive 
in the production of Japanese sake, refreshing beverages, 
pickled vegetables, soy sauce, bread, and beer. In terms of 
industrial consumption, it is used for the production of 
leather, textiles, plastics, medicines, and agricultural 
pesticides. Recently, derivatives of lactic acid or 
intermediates for synthesis which are lactic esters such as 
ethyl lactate and butyl lactate have been finding extensive 
utility for solvents and detergents of the kind featuring 
high safety. Polylactic acid which is a polymer of lactic 
acid is expected to find growing utility as a biodegradable 
polymer. The lactic acid available today is known in two 
types; the lactic acid obtained from a petrochemical product 
by chemical synthesis and the lactic acid obtained by 
fermentation. The lactic acid which is obtained from a 
petrochemical product by chemical synthesis is generally 
purified in the form of a lactic ester. The lactic ester, 
therefore, has high purity. It is, however, racemic in form 
and devoid of optical activity. The lactic acid which is 
produced by fermentation occurs in an L- or D-optically 
active form and racemic form. A desired optically active 
form of this lactic acid can be prepared freely, depending 
on the kind of a microorganism to be used for fermentation. 
Generally, such lactates are not easy to purify, inferior in 
quality to their synthetically produced countertypes, and 
unfit for the production of medicines or agricultural 
pesticides. To be specific, for use as food additives and 
for general industrial consumption, such racemic forms of  
 
lactic acid or lactic esters as are produced by the chemical 
synthesis can be used quite safely. As raw materials for 
medicines and agricultural pesticides or as a raw material 
for the polylactic acid accepted as a biodegradable polymer, 
however, the lactic acid or the lactic ester is required to 
possess high optical activity and high purity. The lactic acid which possesses such high optical 
activity as mentioned above, however, cannot be produced 
except by a process of fermentation in the existing 
circumstances. Today, the lactic acid manufactured by 
fermentation and possessed of optical activity is obtained 
by a method of fermentation using glucide or starch as a raw 
material and causing lactic acid bacteria to assimilate the 
raw material. This method comprises preparing a culture 
mediu
