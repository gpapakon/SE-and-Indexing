<ABSTRACT>
In order to generate a dot clock for a liquid crystal display 
device from a horizontal sync signal with reduced skew, a PLL is divided 

into three functional parts. The first part is a means 29, 36, 34 for 
obtaining a particular frequency. This means is so configured that 

voltage is supplied from latch type DAC (digital/analog converter) 29 to 
VCO 30. A horizontal sync signal is estimated from the dot clock finally 

generated. According to the difference between this estimated horizontal 
sync signal and actual horizontal sync signal, the value of DAC 29 is 

increased or decreased. This correction by increase or decrease is made 
by, for example, the vertical sync timing. The second part is a 

synchronization means 34, 41, 42. A signal corresponding to the phase 
error between the actual horizontal sync signal and dot clock is added to 

the signal from DAC 29 to control the phase of the dot clock. The third 
part is a PLL means 31, 32 for generating the dot clock according to the 

signal having the particular frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a dot clock generator 
for a liquid crystal display device, and more particularly to such 
generator which can generate a dot clock with less skew from a sync 
signal. The CRT (cathode ray tube) has been widely used as a monitor of a 
personal computer, and the interface between the personal computer and 
CRT is made unique to the CRT. Specifically, R, G, and B analog signals, 
and vertical and horizontal sync signals are generated in the personal 
computer unit and provided to the CRT. When a liquid crystal display 
device is used instead of a CRT in a computer system employing such 
interface, the liquid crystal display device needs to generate an 
additional dot clock. In other words, the liquid crystal display device 
needs to receive R, G, and B digital signals for every dot timing (dot 
clock) to drive the liquid crystal panel based on these signals. Since 
the personal computer unit outputs only the analog RGB and sync signals 
to the above CRT interface, it is necessary to generate a dot clock from 
the sync signals and, according to the timing of this clock, convert the 
analog RGB signals to digital RGB signals by the A/D conversion. A phase locked loop (PLL) circuit shown in Fig. 1 may be used to 
generate a dot clock from a sync signal, i.e. horizontal sync signal. In 
Fig. 1, phase comparator 11 is supplied with the horizontal sync signal 
and the output of frequency divider 12. The comparison outputs (positive 
and negative) of phase comparator 11 is inputted to voltage controlled 
oscillator (VCO) 15 via filter 13 and capacitor 14. Then the output of 
VCO 15 is given as a dot clock and fed back to frequency divider 12. 
Assuming that frequency divider 12 has a division ratio of 1/N, the dot 
clock to be outputted will have a frequency of N times the horizontal 
sync signal. In the above conventional arrangement, however, a problem arises 
that the screen is disturbed by the jitters of the dot clock due to the 
jitters of the horizontal sync signal itself, the beat between the  
 
jitters of the horizontal sync signal, and the circulation of power 
supply noise into VCO 15. In addition, with such arrangement, the noise from frequency 
divider 12 is superimposed on the voltage across capacitor 14, leading to 
a difficulty in generating a stable dot clock necessary for the liquid 
crystal display. If the phase of frequency divider 12 is delayed with 
respect to the horizontal sync signal, i.e. if the clock frequency is too 
low, the voltage across
