<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF-EXPANDING PROSTHESIS HAVING STABLE AXIAL LENGTHTechnical Field The present invention relates to body implantable devices, and more particularly to prostheses and grafts intended for long-term or permanent fixation in body cavities.Background Art A wide variety of patient treatment and diagnostic procedures involve the use of devices inserted into the body of the patient, with some of these devices being permanently implanted. Among these devices are prostheses or grafts for transluminal implantation, for example as disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,655,771 (Wallsten) . The prosthesis described in Wallsten is a flexible tubular braided structure formed of helically wound thread elements. Gripping members at opposite ends of the prosthesis initially secure it to a catheter, with the proximal gripping member being movable distally to give the prosthesis the shape of a balloon. In deployment, the gripping members and catheter are removed, leaving the prosthesis to assume a substantially cylindrical shape as it slightly expands and substantially conforms to a blood vessel wall or other tissue. Another prosthesis is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,681,110 (Wiktor) . A flexible tubular liner, constructed of braided strands of a flexible plastic, is insertable into the aorta, whereupon it self-expands against an aneurysm to direct blood flow past the aneurysm. The braided stents of Wallsten and Wiktor axially contract as they radially expand.Another elastic stent is shown in U. S. Patent No. 4,830,003 (Wolff et al) . The stent includes a 

series of generally longitudinal wires welded together in pairs, with the wires in each pair then bent into a MVH shape. Like the braided stents, this stent shortens axially as it radially expands. Prostheses also have been constructed of plastically deformable materials. U. S. Patent No. 4,733,665 (Pal az) discloses intraluminal vascular grafts radially expanded using angioplaÎµty balloons. The grafts are wire mesh tubes, and axially shorten as they radially expand. U. S. Patent No. 4,800,882 (Gianturco) features a stent formed of wire, including a plurality of serpentine bends to form opposed loops. A balloon is inflated to radially expand the stent, without substantial axial shortening.Yet another approach to prosthesis design is shown in U. S. Patent No. 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al) . Alfidi et al discloses a strainer or screen with a plurality of generally longitudinal wires, bound together by a cylindrical sleeve. The wires are deformable into a longitudinal,

CLAIMS
1. A device for fixation in a body cavity, comprising: a stent (16) including generally tubular and coaxial first and second open weave stent segments (20, 22) slidably engaged along respective first and second axially inward portions overlapping one another to form a medial region (24) of the stent
(16) , said stent segments (20, 22) further including respective non-overlapping first and second axially outward regions (30, 32) including respective and opposite first and second ends (34, 36) of the stent
(16) ; said stent segments (20, 22) , at least along said axially inward portions, having a predetermined first diameter and a predetermined first axial length, said stent segments (20, 22) being radially compressible to a second diameter less than said first diameter and to a second axial length longer than said first axial length, to facilitate an axial insertion of said stent (16) into a body cavity for delivery to a selected location therealong and subsequent fixation of the stent (16) within the cavity by effecting an engagement of the stent segments (20, 22) with a tissue wall segment defining said body cavity; and wherein said first and second axially inward portions slide relative to one another to reduce the axial length of said medial region (24) as said stent segments (20, 22) radially expand into said engagement, thus to maintain a substantially constant axial length of said stent (16) during said radial expansion. 


 2. The device of Claim 1 wherein: each of said stent segments (20, 22) is an open weave construction of helically wound filaments (18) of a resilient, body-compatible material. 3. The device of Claim 2 further including: a means for fixing said first and second ends (34, 36) to said tissue wall segment.
4. The device of Claim 3 wherein: said stent segments (20, 22) are flexible and have said predetermined first diameter and first axial length when not subject to external force, and are elastically compressible to said second diameter.
5. The device of Claim 4 wherein: said fixing means comprises first and second flared outer end portions of said first and second axially outward regions (30, 32), respectively, whereby said first and second ends (34, 36) have diameters greater than said first diameter when the stent (16) is in the relaxed state. 6. The device of Claim 5 wherein: the diameters of said first and second ends (34, 36) are greater than said first diameter by at least five percent.
7. The device of Claim 6 wherein: the axial length of each of said flared outer end portions is less than one-third of the axial length of its associated one of said stent segments (20, 22) .
8. The device of Claim 4 wherein: said fixing means comprises elastic reinforcing strands connected to said filaments along first and second outer end portions including sa-*d first and second ends (34, 36), respectively.
9. The device of Claim 3 wherein: 


 said fixing means comprises first and second pluralities of fixation hooks mounted to the stent (16) at said first and second ends (34, 36), respectively. 10. The device of Claim 1 further including: an elongate, flexible and substantially inextensible member running axially and connected to said first and second stent segments (20, 22) proximate said first and second ends (34, 36), for maintaining the axial length of the stent (16) constant during said radial expansion.
