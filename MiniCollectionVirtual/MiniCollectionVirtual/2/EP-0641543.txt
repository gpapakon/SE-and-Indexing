<ABSTRACT>
The probe (1) consists of a pair of light sources (17) and a light 
detector (18) which are 

placed between two of the plurality of layers (11 to 16) of the 
conformable material used 

to implement the probe (1). The layers (11 to 16) are designed to be 
self-aligning when placed 

in the assembly press (30) for heat-sealing the perimeter of the 
probe (1). The heat-sealing 

process both protects the light sources (17) and detector (18) 
from fluids and also 

functions to precisely position and secure these devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical monitoring devices and, in particular, to a neonatal 
probe that is designed to be efficiently manufactured to create a probe that 
is simple to use, inexpensive, easily conformed to the patient's appendage and 
sealed to enable it to be cleaned for reuse. It is a problem in the field of medical monitoring apparatus to manufacture a 
probe that satisfies a number of diverse and sometimes contradictory 
requirements. It is important that the probe be simple to use, in that it conforms 
to a variety of patients who differ in size and shape. The probe must be 
securely affixable to the patient, such as on a patient's appendage, without 
requiring complex structures or elements that can irritate the patient. In 
addition, the probe must be either inexpensive so that it can be disposable after 
one use or able to be cleaned so that it can be used for many patient 
applications. If the probe is reusable, then the active elements contained therein 
that perform the sensing and measuring functions must be protected from the 
ambient environment and, likewise, it is a requirement that the patient be 
shielded from any potentially dangerous electrical signals or heat produced by 
the probe. The probe must also reliably and accurately perform the required 
measurements. The method of manufacture must therefore be efficient to 
minimize the cost of the probe and yet simple to ensure that the probe is reliable 
in its operation. The reliability of an object is a function of the number of components contained 
therein, their respective reliabilities, as well as the complexity of the structure 
that is produced. It is therefore beneficial to provide a probe that uses a 
minimum number of components as well as a minimum number of steps in its 
assembly process. The assembly process should also be designed to enable the 
probe to be accurately manufactured without requiring the use of complex 
manufacturing apparatus or processes.  In the field of medical monitoring apparatus, a difficult probe to produce is a 
neo-natal probe that is used for pulse oximetry measurements. These probes 
are typically affixed to the baby's foot, wrapped around the instep, since this 
site is both highly vascularized and of a geometry that provides sufficient 
structure to enable the probe to be securely affixed to the infant. Many of the 
existing neo-natal pulse oximetry probes are not reusable and therefore result in 
a significant additional expense in the hospital environment for monitoring neo-natal

<CLAIMS>
A medical monitoring probe (1) comprising: 
a plurality of sensor elements (17,18) and 

housing means (4) enclosing said plurality of sensor elements (17, 18) is 
characterised in that, said housing (4) means comprises at least two outer 

layers (11, 16) of conformable material being heat sealed together to 
substantially prevent interchange of fluids between an ambient 

environment extant around said probe (1) and said plurality of sensor 
elements (17, 18); and 

wherein said housing means (4) secures said plurality of sensor elements 
(17, 18) in a predetermined position within said housing means (4) via 

said heat seal, absent form sustaining elements included in said housing 
means. 
A probe as claimed in claim 1, wherein said plurality of sensor elements 
comprises: 

light source means (17) for generating at least two beams of light, each 
of which are at a predetermined wavelength, which wavelengths differ 

from each other; and 
light detector means (18) for generating a signal indicative of an intensity 

of light received by said light detector means (18). 
A probe as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein said housing means (4) further 
comprises:

 
a plurality of inner layers (12 to 15) sealed together inside of and with 

said at least two outer layers (11, 16) of said housing means (4) to form 
an integral structure. 
A probe as claimed in claim 3 wherein: 
at least one (13) of said inner layers blocks the transmission of light from

wherein said at least one inner layer (13) includes first and second 
openings (5, 6) therein located over said light source means (17) and said 

light detector means (18), respectively, to enable the transmission of light
