<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a card of the identity card, credit card type, equipped with a validity control device making it possible to do without further, enhanced hardware for verification. It results from the association of a structure S1 including at least one layer of piezoelectric material and of a structure S2 including a material capable of switching electrically between two optical states (I) and (II) which differ in respect of occular perception; these structures S1 and S2 being linked electrically. On bending the card, the appearance or non-appearance of the change of optical state makes it possible to confirm or deny the validity of the card.
