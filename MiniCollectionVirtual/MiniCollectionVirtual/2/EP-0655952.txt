<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic hydrated metal oxide and metal silicate gels are supported on the surface of particles of porous material by precipitation therein without significant deposit within pores of the support material and without encapsulating the particles of porous material. Especially preferred hydrated oxides and silicate gels are those of titanium. Preferred porous particles are composed of carbon. These novel composite materials are prepared by spraying an aqueous basic material to the porous particles and then spraying a concentrated aqueous acidic solution of a source of suitable metallic ions so as to rapidly form a gelatinous precipitate on the surface of the porous particles which remain porous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of amorphous hydrated metal oxide and
amorphous metal silicate gels to remove various metals
from aqueous solutions is notoriously old in the art. The
patent and technical literature contains many examples of
such techniques. It was recently discovered that
certain amorphous titanium and tin silicate gels
demonstrated remarkable rates of uptake for heavy metal
species such as lead, cadmium, zinc, chromium and mercury
which are an order of magnitude greater than that of prior
art absorbents or ion exchangers under the conditions
tested which include the presence of competing ions such
as calcium and magnesium. The combination of extraordinary
lead selectivity, capacity and uptake rates permitted
such materials to strip lead from aqueous streams with
minimal contact time, allowing direct end use in filters
for water purification, be it under-the-counter or under-the-faucet,
or whole-house devices. See U.S. 5,053,139.Granular activated carbon (GAC) is also used in water
purification or remediation processes, in some cases in
combination with inorganic metal ion-exchangers. GAC
improves taste, odor and smell by adsorbing ionic metals,
organic molecules and colloidal particles. GAC also
removes chlorine by reducing the chlorine to chloride
ions.The adsorption properties of GAC are dependent upon
the pore volume and pore size distribution of the
material. Small organic materials., e.g., volatile organic
compounds (VOC) such as chloroform, are adsorbed into the
micropores (pores less than 20 angstroms in diameter).
Larger organic materials, e.g., herbicides or pesticides 
or colloidal particles are adsorbed in the mesopores
(pores between 20 and 500 angstroms). The macropores
(pores between 500 and 2K angstroms) are least important for
adsorption, but do trap larger sediment particles.Prior art directed to composites of support particles
such as activated carbon and inorganic ion-exchangers
include U.S. 4,692,431, Weller and U.S. 4,178,270, Fujita
et al. These patents deal with the problem of providing
mechanically strong particles of inorganic ion-exchangers
and do so by precipitating metal oxide gels on support
materials. With efforts directed to securing an effective
bond between these components, patentees did not attempt
to utilize significantly the inherent benefit of the
porous support itself to bind material not captured by the
inorganic ion-exchanger. Thus, Weller intentionally
deposited precipitated metal oxide within pores of a
carbon support. Fujita et al. relied on utilizing a
support and
