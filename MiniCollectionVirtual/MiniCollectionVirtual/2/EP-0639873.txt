<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a connector which can 
readily position distal ends of terminal pins 2. The 

connector comprises a plurality of terminal pins 2 having 
ends extending perpendicularly from a connector body 1 

and a comb like longitudinal positioning member 3. A 
comb like lateral positioning member 4 is attached to the 

longitudinal positioning member 3 in a vertical direction, 
thereby positioning distal ends of the terminal pins 2. 

The positioning members 3 and 4 enclose the distal ends 
of the terminal pins 2 in a grid manner to position the 

distal ends longitudinally and laterally.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector which is
attached to a support plate by inserting a plurality of
terminal pins of the connector into apertures in the
support plate.A connector is known which connects wiring cables
to terminals on a printed circuit plate or the like.
This connector is provided with a plurality of projected
terminal pins adapted to be inserted into holes in the
terminals. Since the terminal pins must be inserted into
small insertion holes at the same time upon attaching,
attaching work is troublesome. For example, the connector
cannot be attached to the printed circuit plate if distal
ends of some of the terminal pins are deflected from the
given positions. In particular, the terminal pins of
the connector are made of a bendable metal strip and are
projected away from the connector body. An arrangement of
the distal ends is likely to go out of control and thus
will misconnect with the insertion holes. Consequently,
heretofore, the terminal pins have been inserted into the
insertion holes while adjusting the arrangement of the
pins.In order to overcome the above problem, Japanese
Patent Public Disclosure No. 62-136784 (1987) discloses
a connector. For convenience of explanation, the
disclosed connector will be described below by referring
to FIGS. 5 and 6. FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the
prior connector, illustrating a state before being
assembled. FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the prior
connector illustrating an assembled state. As shown in
FIGS. 5 and 6, a positioning plate c, which is provided
with positioning holes d corresponding to insertion holes
in a printed circuit plate, is attached to a connector
body a. The distal ends of terminal pins b are inserted
into the positioning holes d. Thus, an arrangement of 
the distal ends of the terminal pins b is brought into coincidence with an
arrangement of the insertion holes.However, a plurality of terminal pins which are disordered must be
inserted into the positioning holes at the same time in the prior art. This
is troublesome in the same manner of inserting the terminal pins into the
insertion holes in the printed circuit plate without positioning the pins.
Although the above work becomes easy at the stage of attaching the
connector to the printed circuit plate, it is necessary to position the pins
in order to attach the positioning plate c to the connector body a.
Ultimately, the prior art cannot eliminate the troublesome work to insert
the terminal pins into the small holes.EP-A-0 128 306 and EP-A-0 335 160 both disclose
