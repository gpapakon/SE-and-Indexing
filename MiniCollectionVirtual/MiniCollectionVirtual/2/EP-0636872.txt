<ABSTRACT>
An automatic masking system is described in an optical time 
domain reflectometer for implementing a method of compensating 

for relaxation transients in an optical receiver in the OTDR. 
The masking system drives an optical modulator that masks the 

optical receiver from high amplitude optical pulses in the 
return reflected light from a fiber under test. A masking 

pattern corresponding to the high amplitude optical pulses is 
generated from a first acquisition of data with the receiver 

unmasked from the return reflected light. The masking pattern is 
stored and used for generating a signal from the masking system 

to the optical modulator for blocking the high amplitude optical 
pulses in the return reflected light during a subsequent 

acquisition of data. In a third acquisition of data of the 
return reflected light, the optical modulator masks the receiver 

from the return reflected light. Combining the acquired data of 
the blocked return reflected light with the acquired data with 

the high amplitude optical pulses blocked, produces an output 
free of relaxation transients produced by the receiver. 

Combining the high amplitude optical pulse data from the first 
acquisition with the output from the subtracted acquisitions 

produces an output representative of the return reflected light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automasking system 
for blocking a high amplitude optical pulse in the return reflected 
light for use in an optical time domain reflectometer. Optical time domain reflectometers, OTDR, are used for 
testing optical transmission lines, such as fiber optic 
cables and the like, for attenuation, discontinuities, and 
faults, which affect the quality of optical signals 
transmitted through the fiber. In testing an optical fiber 
with an OTDR, the fiber under test is connected to a front 
panel connector and optical pulses from a laser are 
launched into the fiber. During the interval between the 
pulses, backscattered light from the fiber produced by the 
Rayleigh effect and light produced by discrete reflection 
sites are directed to a photosensitive detector, such as an 
avalanche photodiode or the like. The detector converts the 
backscattered light signal into an electrical signal, which 
is amplified, sampled and displayed on an output device. 
Discontinuities associated with cable splices and the like 
may produce return reflections that are orders of  
 
magnitude greater than the backscatter signal level. 
The large reflected signals overdrive the optical 
receiver producing an output electrical pulse that has 
a slowly decaying trailing edge. This receiver 
transient tail may be caused by carrier diffusion or 
trapping effects in the photodetector. Amplifier 
transient responses may also exhibit slowly decaying 
transients. To view events in the fiber that would be hidden 
or distorted by the receiver transient tail, OTDR 
instrument makers have used optical modulators in the 
return optical signal path to mask the high amplitude 
reflections returning from the fiber under test. Data 
samples of the return reflected light from the fiber 
are acquired, processed, and displayed. An operator 
identifies the locations of the high amplitude 
reflections and manually sets mask locations 
corresponding to the reflections. With the mask 
locations set, the fiber is re-examined. The optical 
modulator blocks the return optical signal from the 
fiber at the mask locations identified by the 
operator. The masking function is triggered either by 
a counter/digital comparator system or an analog 
ramp/comparator during the cable re-examination. One 
drawback to such systems is that the number of mask 
points is limited by the amount of hardware required 
to implement the system. In addition, the mask points 
have to be set manually by the operator and then the 
cable has to
