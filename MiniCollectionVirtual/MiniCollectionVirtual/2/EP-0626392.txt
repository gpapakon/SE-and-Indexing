<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic cellulose hydroxyalkyl hydroxy carboxylic esters which are insoluble in water and have the general structure:  Cell-O-R where Cell-O is the substituted OH group of a polymeric cellullose unit, and either R is a mono- and/or polymeric hydroxyalkyl ether hydroxy carboxylic ester of the structure X:  X=-A-B-  in which A is a linear polyether chain:  A=(-D-O-)n in which D is a linear aliphatic branched or unbranched chain with 2 to 11 C atoms, and n is an integer equal to or greater than 1, and B is a linear polyester chain:

>
 in which E is a linear aliphatic branched or unbranched chain with 2 to 5 C atoms, and m is an integer equal to or greater than 1, or R equals A or B or X and a combination thereof in any desired ratio, or R is corresponding to the degree of substitution per anhydroglucose unit (max. 3) with A, B or X equal to H (hydrogen), and to a process for the preparation thereof and to the use of these cellulose derivatives as biodegradable moulded articles.

<CLAIMS>
Thermoplastic, water-insoluble, cellulose hydroxyalkyl
hydroxycarboxylic acid esters of the general

structure:

Cell-O-R

wherein Cell-O is the substituted OH group of a
polymeric cellulose unit and R is either a monomeric

and/or polymeric hydroxyalkylether hydroxycarboxylic
acid ester of the structure X:


X = -A-B

in which A is a linear polyether chain:

A = (-D-O-)
n

in which D signifies a linear aliphatic branched or
unbranched chain with 2 to 11 C atoms and n is a whole

number equal to or greater than 1, and B is a linear
polyester chain:



and m is a whole number equal to or greater than 1, or
R is equal to A or B or X and a combination thereof in

any ratio, or R is equal to H (hydrogen) according to
the degree of substitution per anhydroglucose unit

(max. 3) with A, B or X.
Process for the production of water-insoluble and
thermoplastic cellulose derivatives according to 

claim 1, characterised in that the cellulose is
reacted undissolved with epoxides and lactide, the

cellulose being activated with lye and subsequently
reacted either with or without a suspending agent with

epoxides and subsequently in the same reaction mixture
with lactide.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that
the cellulose is pre-activated by treating with

aqueous NaOH or mixtures of aqueous NaOH with watersoluble
organic solvents.
Process according to claims 2 or 3 in which the alkali
cellulose is freed from water by drying or,

alternatively, by extraction with organic solvents.
Process according to claims 2 to 4, in which the
water-moist alkali cellulose is reacted with epoxides,

the water is subsequently distilled off and the still
alkaline hydroxyethylcellulose is reacted with

lactide.
Mouldings, films, fibres and blends, characterised in
that they consist of at least 10 % cellulose

hydroxyalkyl lactic acid esters according to claim 1.
