<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of 
substituted aromatic azo compounds. In one aspect, this 
invention relates to the production of substituted 
aromatic amines. In another aspect, this invention 
relates to the production of 4-aminodiphenylamine 
(4-ADPA) or substituted derivatives thereof. In another 
aspect, this invention relates to the preparation of 
alkylated p-phenylenediamines or substituted derivatives 
thereof useful as antioxidants from the substituted 
aromatic amines, such as 4-ADPA or substituted 
derivatives thereof. It is known to prepare substituted aromatic 
amines by way of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution 
mechanism wherein an amino functional nucleophile 
replaces halide. For example, it is known to prepare 
4-ADPA by way of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution 
mechanism, wherein an aniline derivative replaces 
halide. This method involves preparation of a 4-ADPA 
intermediate, namely 4-nitrodiphenylamine (4-NDPA) 
followed by reduction of the nitro moiety. The 4-NDPA 
is prepared by reacting p-chloronitrobenzene with an 
aniline derivative, such as formanilide or an alkali 
metal salt thereof, in the presence of an acid acceptor 
or neutralizing agent, such as potassium carbonate, and, 
optionally, utilizing a catalyst. See, for example, 
U.S. 4,187,248; U.S. 4,683,332; U.S. 4,155,936; U.S. 
4,670,595; U.S. 4,122,118; U.S. 4,614,817; U.S. 
4,209,463; U.S. 4,196,146; U.S. 4,187,249; U.S. 
4,140,716. This method is disadvantageous in that the 
halide that is displaced is corrosive to the reactors 
and appears in the waste stream and must therefore be  
 
disposed of at considerable expense. Furthermore, use 
of an aniline derivative such as formanilide, and use of 
p-chloro-nitrobenzene, requires additional manufacturing 
equipment and capabilities to produce such starting 
materials from aniline and nitrobenzene, respectively. It is also known to prepare 4-ADPA from the 
head-to-tail coupling of aniline. See, for example, 
G.B. 1,440,767 and U.S. 4,760,186. This method is 
disadvantageous in that the yield of 4-ADPA is not 
acceptable for a commercial process. It is also known 
to decarboxylate a urethane to produce 4-NDPA. See 
U.S. 3,847,990. However, such method is not 
commercially practical in terms of cost and yield. It is known to prepare 4-ADPA by hydrogenating 
p-nitrosodiphenylhydroxylamine which can be prepared by 
catalytic dimerization of nitrosobenzene utilizing, as a 
reducing agent, aliphatic compounds, benzene, 
naphthalene or ethylenically
