<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical guidewires
typically used by physicians to gain access to restricted
regions of the body and over which therapeutic devices
such as small-diameter interventional catheters are
threaded for insertion to a point of interest.It has long been recognized that acoustic imaging
by a catheter containing a rotating transducer is useful
in visualizing conditions of the body. It has been
obvious that a therapeutic device, if sufficiently large,
could be slid over such a catheter for insertion to a
point of interest. However, practical features have not
been available to enable realization of an acoustic
guidewire, i.e., a true guidewire that contains a
rotating transducer and which simultaneously provides the
hand with the feel and torquability of a typical
guidewire for enabling introduction of small diameter
therapeutic devices in typical guidewire fashion, and
which also has a useful acoustic imaging capability.U.S. Patent 4794931 of Yock shows a prior art catheter based
ultrasonic apparatus in which an ultrasonic transducer is carried
by the distal end of a catheter, the catheter having a guidewire
or torque cable therewithin terminating within a housing
surrounded by a balloon. To the distal end of the housing is
mounted a short length of flexible wire tip.EP-A-0466424 of Cardiometrics, Inc discloses a torqueable
guidewire assembly which is enabled for acoustic scanning. The
guidewire is connected to drive means at its proximal end. It
has a main body consisting of a hollow tube and a housing
containing the scanning means. The proximal end of the housing
is coupled to the distal end of the main tube by a helical
connector. A flexible tip is formed by a second helical wire
section which is connected to the distal end of the housing. The present invention provides features that enable the
achievement of an improved acoustic guidewire.Thus in accordance with the present invention, we provide
a medical guidewire having a substantially uniform diameter
throughout its length, and incorporating within said length means
for lateral acoustic scanning, said guidewire comprising a
proximal connector portion, an extended substantially hollow main
body portion, an axially elongated transition portion containing
said acoustic scanning portion, and a floppy tip portion; and
being characterised in that said main body portion has a torque-transmitting
winding therearound, said winding extending from
said proximal portion across said transition portion, and said
winding attaching to said
