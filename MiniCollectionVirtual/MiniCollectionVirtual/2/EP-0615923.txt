<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spray apparatus for a medium to be sprayed. The spray apparatus contains an outer container (1) intended for multiple reuse, an inner container (5) which can be inserted in said outer container, can be exchanged if required, and is intended to receive the medium, a lid (8) which can be releasably connected to the outer container and has an incorporated spray valve (9), and a filling valve (17) for a pressurised gas intended for spraying the medium. According to the invention, the inner container (5) is of can-shaped design and the filling valve (17) is designed for introducing the pressurised gas into the inner container (5). A separate clamping ring (12) preferably serves to connect the lid to the outer container (Figure 1).

Spray device for a medium to be sprayed, with an 
outer container (1) intended for multiple application 

and having a receiving aperture (3), with an inner 
container (5) which may be inserted in the receiving 

aperture (3)and exchanged when necessary and is 
intended to receive the medium, with a cover (8) which 

may be detachably connected to the outer container (1), 
has an integrated spray valve (9) and closes the inner 

container (5) pressure-tight, and with a filling valve 
(17) for a compressed gas intended for spraying the 

medium, 
characterised in that
 the inner container (5) 
has the form of a can, open upwards and capable of 

being closed pressure-tight by the cover (8), and the 
filling valve (17) is designed to feed the compressed 

gas into the inner container (5). 
Spray device according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the filling valve (17) is designed to be in the 
base (4) of the inner container (5) and the outer 

container (1) is provided with an aperture which makes 
access to the filling valve (17) possible. 
Spray device according to claim 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the outer container (1) is designed to be 
tubular.  

 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the cover (8) may be connected to 
the outer container (1) by means of a screw connection. 
Spray device according to claim 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the screw connection has, separate from the 
cover (8) and capable of being screwed on to the outer 

container (1), a clamp ring for bracing the cover (8) 
between the latter and the outer container (1). 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the inner container (5) has an 
outer cross-section broadly corresponding to the inner 

cross-section of the receiving aperture (3) 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the inner container (5) has at an 
end distant from its base (4) an edge section (6) 

projecting radially outwards and which, in the 
assembled state of the inner container (5), lies on a 

face (7) of the outer container (1) bordering one end 
of the receiving aperture (3). 
Spray device according to one of claims 3 to 7, 

characterised in that
 the outer container (1) has a 
stop means (24) for the inner container (5) projecting 

radially inwards into the receiving aperture (3).  
 
Spray device according to claim 8, 
characterised 
in that
 the stop means (24) is designed to be annular. 
Spray device according to claim 8 or 9, 

characterised in that
 the distance of the stop means 
(24) from the face (7) broadly corresponds to the 

distance of the base (4) from the edge section (6). 
Spray device according to one of claims 5 to 10, 

characterised in that
 the spray valve (9) is a 
commercially available valve and the cover (8) in 

assembled state lies on the face (7) of the outer 
container (1) or the edge section (6) of the inner 

container (5). 
Spray device according to one of claims 5 to 11, 

characterised in that
 the tension ring (12) is 
configured in the manner of a union nut. 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 12, 

characterised in that
 a sealing ring (16) is provided 
to improve the closing effect of the cover (8). 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 13, 

characterised in that
 an additional valve is allocated 
to the inner container (5) as an outlet for the 

compressed gas.  
 
Spray device according to one of claims 1 to 14, 

characterised in that
 a displaceable piston (19) is 
disposed sealed in the inner container (5) and, towards 

the open side of the inner container (5), divides a 
chamber (20) for the medium to be sprayed from a 

chamber (21) for the compressed gas, and 
in that
 the 
piston (19) has, on the side of the medium to be 

sprayed, a pressure spring (23) intended to co-operate 
with the cover (8) or with the spray valve (9).
