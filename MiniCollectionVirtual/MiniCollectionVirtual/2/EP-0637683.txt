<ABSTRACT>
The system makes it possible to decrease the clearance between the rotor and the stator of a turbine (40) of a turbojet, during the various operating phases of the latter whilst keeping the temperatures of the discs within the limits of their mechanical behaviour. The discs (4) of the turbine (40) are ventilated by drawn-off high-pressure air at high temperature (2), and the stator is ventilated by drawn-off low-pressure low-temperature air (3). The respective temperatures of these two drawn-off fractions are homogenised by a heat exchanger (1). The latter is short circuited by a bypass (5) on the low-pressure circuit to make it possible to keep the clearances in the turbine (40) as stable as possible on the basis of the various speed and load conditions of the turbojet, by means of a valve (6) driven by the computer. Application to aircraft turbojets.

System for ventilating the discs (4) and the 
stator of the turbine (40) of a turbojet engine, 

including: 

a first tapping (2) for high-pressure air at a 
relatively high temperature, this being intended to 

cool the discs (4) and splitting into a number of 
cooling tubes (7), 
a tapping (3) for low-pressure air at a relatively 
low temperature, this being intended to cool the 

stator and includinq a bypass line (5) and a valve 
(6) placed upstream of the bypass line (5) and 

controlled in such a way as to control the supply to 
this bypass line (5) as a function of the speed of 

the turbojet engine; 
a heat exchanger (1) applied to these two tappings 
(2, 3) for cooling the high-pressure air, the low-pressure 

cold air becoming heated, thus allowing the 
discs (4) and the stator of the turbine (40) to be 

cooled during the various phases of operation of the 
turbojet engine, the bypass line (5) allowing the 

heat exchanger (1) to be short-circuited. 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cooling tubes (7) of the high-pressure tapping 

(2) open near to the discs (4) of the rotor of the 
turbine (40) in order to cool them. 
System according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the low-pressure air tapping (3) is split up into 

several cooling tubes (17) opening near to the stator of 
the turbine (40). 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that it comprises a second high-pressure hot air tapping 
(8) passing through the heat exchanger (1) in order thus 

to allow the flow rate of hot air passing through the 
exchanger (1) to be increased, and the low-pressure cold 

air to be heated up more in order to heat up the discs of 
the turbine (40) during phases in which the turbojet 

engine is running at cruising speed. 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that for each high-pressure air cooling tube (7A, ..., 

7N) it comprises: 

a pressure sensor (11A, ..., 11N) placed upstream of 
the heat exchanger (1); 
a controlled valve (12A, ..., 12N), placed on the 
corresponding cooling tube (7A,..., 7N) upstream of 

the pressure sensor (11A, ..., 11N) ; 
a computer (15) being connected to the output from 
each sensor (11A,..., 11N) and to the input of each 

controlled valve (12A, ..., 12N) for regulating these 
controlled valves as a function of the thermodynamic 

parameters of the conditions in which the turbojet 
engine is running and, on the other hand, as a 

function of any drop in pressure in one of the high-pressure 
cooling tubes (7A,..., 7N).
