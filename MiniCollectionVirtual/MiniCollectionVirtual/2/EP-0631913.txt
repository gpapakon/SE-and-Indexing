<ABSTRACT>
An opposed wiping type wiper unit has a crank arm 
(3) which can be rotatably driven by a motor (2), an 

intermediate link (4) connected to right-hand and 
left-hand wiper shafts (6) through driving rods (8; 

9), and a connecting rod (5) for connecting the crank 
arm and the intermediate link. The length of the 

connecting rod (5) and the connecting position thereof 
to the intermediate link (4) are set so that the 

actual angular acceleration change of the intermediate 
link (4) is substantially symmetrical, and the angular 

velocity changes of right-hand and left-hand wiper 
arms are made asymmetrical on the basis of the set 

length of the driving rods (8, 9) and the set 
connecting positions thereof to the intermediate link. 

Thus, the opposed wiping type wiper unit can easily be 
designed in accordance with both right-hand and left-hand 

specifications, and permits the use of as many 
parts common to both specifications as possible, 

thereby reducing the cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opposed wiping 
type wiper unit for wiping a window of an automobile or 
the like. Such an opposed wiping type wiper unit generally 
comprises a crank arm which is rotatably driven by a 
motor, an intermediate link pivotally supported at upper 
and lower intermediate positions thereof, a connecting rod 
interposed between the crank arm and the intermediate link 
so as to convert the rotation of the crank arm into 
reciprocating oscillation of the intermediate link. In 
addition, the upper and lower ends of the intermediate 
link are respectively connected to driving levers of 
right- and left-hand wiper shafts through driving rods so 
as to bring about opposed wiping operations of right-hand and 
left-hand wiper arms. Further, the angular velocity 
changes of the right- and left-hand wiper arms are set to 
be asymmetrical so that the wiper blades of the right- and 
left-hand wiper arms are superposed at a lower reversal 
position. Namely, in the vicinity of the lower reversal  
 
position, the angular velocity of the upper wiper arm (on 
the driver side) is set to be higher, and the angular 
velocity of the lower wiper arm (on the passenger 
side) is set to be lower so that the right- hand and left-hand 
wiper blades are superposed without interference 
therebetween. Previously, when the angular velocity changes of the right-hand 
and left-hand wiper arms were set to be 
asymmetrical, however, all factors relating to angular velocity 
changes, such as the length of the connecting rod, the 
connecting position of the connecting rod to the 
intermediate link, the length of the driving rods, the 
connecting positions of the driving rods to the 
intermediate link, etc. were variably set. This not only 
complicates setting but also results in the need to design 
wiper units according to different setting specifications 
for different vehicle types and driven positions (right-hand 
and left-hand specifications). As a result, the parts to be used 
are changed in accordance with the specifications, and the 
number of part types is significantly increased, thereby 
increasing the cost. When a crank arm 3 and a connecting rod 5 are on a 
line at both the lower and upper reversal positions, and 
when both reversal positions A and B are set (uniform 
distribution setting) to be on this line, the intermediate  
 
position C of the crank arm 3 in the forward wiping motion 
of the wiper and the intermediate position C' in the 
backward wiping motion are not at symmetrical opposite
