<ABSTRACT>
Assuming that modules (SC160 to SC163) are combined into assemblies (SSM16B), registers (RCHID), which can be read from and written to via the data bus (DB) to which the modules are connected, are provided for each module, and the addresses of the relevant component and the relevant module are written to them. Also assuming that, if a component is not connected to the data bus, voltage values which correspond to one binary value appear at the corresponding interface, and that the register of the component can contain a bit of the other binary value if it is reset by a voltage reduction, faulty connections and undesired voltage reductions can be recognised by interrogating the said register (RCHID).

<CLAIMS>
Method for checking the correct connection of
integrated circuit chips, and also of assemblies

combining a respective plurality of such circuit chips,
to an interface having an associated data bus (DB),

which can be used for writing and reading addresses,
data and instructions intended for components of the

chips and assemblies, and also associated connections
for the voltage supply,


where addresses for the respective assembly (SSM16B)
and addresses for the respective chip (SC16) are

written to read/write registers (RCHID) for the
individual chips, which registers are connected to the

data bus (DB) and, in the event of operating voltage
reductions made in order to bring about defined initial

operating states, have bits with the one binary value
(0) written to them, and at whose interface connections

voltage conditions corresponding to bits with the other
binary value (1) prevail in the event of the

respectively associated chip not being connected,
and where the contents of the relevant read/write
registers (RCHID) are requested and are monitored for a

match with the respectively expected address or for the
occurrence of nothing but bits with the same binary

value (0, 1),
characterized

in that
 one of the two aforementioned addresses, each
forming a total address, is written to the 

aforementioned read/write registers (RCHID) in inverted
form, and in this context the provision of such a total

address comprising only bits with the aforementioned
other binary value (1) is prevented.
