<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement usable as a core for a dental prosthesis or as a transfer jig in forming a model of an alveolar arch with one or more implants (24), comprising a nut (36) which is for fitting in a hexagonal portion of a socket (30) in the implant (24), a ring (35) for fitting over the nut (36) and seating around the mouth of the socket (30), and a post (37) for screwing through the nut (36) and the ring (35) to the implant (24). The ring (35) also has a hexonal bore portion which receives part of the nut (36). Thus the ring (35) is located spatially and angularly relative to the implant (24) without being socketted therein. When a dental impression has been formed with a plurality of the rings (35) embedded therein, or when a sub-frame for a bridge has been made up on two or more such rings (35) on a model of the alveolar arch made from that impression, it is removed by first unscrewing the post (37) and withdrawing it and the nut (36). Thus the impression or bridge sub-frame is easily removed despite the probability that the axes of the implants (24) in the alveolar arch are not parallel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a model
of at least part of the gum and any adjacent teeth
that surround one or more implants embedded in a
jawbone of a patient, there being for each implant in
the jawbone a similar substitute implant similarly
positioned in the model; to a method of forming a
dental prosthesis for mounting in an implant which is
embedded in a jawbone of a patient and to a dental
formation mounting arrangement.
The dental formation may be a dental
impression or a prosthesis, such as a moulded false
tooth crown or bridge, which is to be fixedly mounted
in either an implant which is embedded in a jawbone
of a patient or in a socket formed in a core which is
fixed in such an implant.A method of making a model of at least part of the gum, and a dental
formation mounting arrangement, comprising the features of the
preamble of claims 1 and 8, respectively, are disclosed in US-A-4 708 654. After a period, say three months, has been allowed
for an implant in a jawbone of a patient to settle,
it is usual for an impression to be made in plastic
material of the surfaces of at least part of the gum,
and any adjacent teeth, that surround the embedded
implant and to be used to make a model of that part
of the gum and the adjacent teeth. A dental
technician uses the model to make a dental 
prosthesis, which may be in the form of a false
tooth, for fitting into a socket in the implant.An integrated implant prosthesis must fit accurately
and be meticulously designed in order to optimise
stress distribution to the supporting bone. Therefore
it is essential for the prosthetic restoration of an
implant that the position of each implant in a
jawbone be accurately recorded and transferred to the
model. This is particularly important for a screw
retained prosthesis. Also, from a contribution
"Prosthodontic Procedures" by George A. Zarb and
Tomas Jansson in "Tissue-Integrated Prostheses-Osseointegration
in Clinical Dentistry" published by
Quintessence Publishing Co. Inc. in 1985, we learn
that a nonparallel, fan-shaped location of implant
fixtures is not conducive to optimal stress loading
and that clinical experience suggests a need for
parallel upright implant fixtures otherwise the
fixture may have to be removed or not used.In practice relative orientation of the implant to
the desired orientation of the dental prosthesis it
is to support is unpredictable, both because the
actual location of the settled implant is difficult
to predict and because the dental surgeon may have to
overcome one or

A method of making a model of at least part of
the gum (27) and any adjacent teeth that surround one

or more implants embedded in a jawbone of a patient,
there being for each implant (24) in the jawbone a

similar substitute implant similarly positioned in
the model, in which the or each implant (24) in the

jawbone has respective locating means comprising a
respective locating element (11) attached to it by

respective fixing means (12) and interengaged with it
so as to be held against rotation relative to it, the

or each fixing means (12) being released and removed
from the respective implant (24) in the jawbone once

the material (26) of the impression has set so as to
disconnect the locating means from the respective

implant (24), the set impression with said locating
means embedded therein is removed from the patient's

mouth and the or each fixing means (12) is used to
fix and locate a respective substitute implant in

place relative to the set impression whilst the model
is formed therearound by casting, the or each fixing

means (12) being released and removed from the
casting when the casting is set to allow the model to

be separated from the set impression, characterised
in that the locating means for the or each implant

(24) includes a respective locating bush (10) and,
whilst the impression is being taken, the or each

locating element (11) and respective fixing means
(12) together locate relative to the respective

implant (24) the respective locating bush (10) which
is fitted over the locating element (11) and when the

impression is set, the or each locating element (11) 
is withdrawn relative to the set impression from its

interengagement with the standard socket (23) of the
respective implant (24) in the jawbone leaving the

respective locating bush (10) embedded in the set
impression material, the or each locating element

(11) being used, together with the fixing means (12)
after the set impression has been removed from the

patient's mouth to fix and locate the respective
substitute implant in place relative to the set

impression whilst the model is formed therearound by
casting, the or each locating element (11) being

removed with the respective fixing (12) means when
the casting is set.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the or each
locating element (11) is held against rotation

relative to the respective implant (24) by the
interengagement of mating flat surfaces formed on it

and on said respective implant (24).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the or each locating element (11) and the respective

locating bush (10) are provided with means (18 and
19) whereby angular movement of the or each locating

bush (10) relative to the respective locating element
(11) is inhibited so that the or each locating bush

(10) is located angularly relatively to the
respective implant (24).
A method according to claim 3, wherein said
angular movement inhibiting means comprise mating

flat surfaces (18 and (19) formed on the or each 
locating element (11) and the respective locating

bush (10).
In a method of forming a dental prosthesis for
mounting in an implant (24) which is embedded in a

jawbone of a patient, a model of at least part of
the gum (27) and any adjacent teeth which surround

the embedded implant (24) is formed, using an
impression, with a substitute implant accurately

located in the model in the place of the original
embedded implant (24) by a method according to any

one of claims 1 to 4, and a selection of a core
(28,45) from which the dental prosthesis is to be

formed is made from a range of cores (28,45) which
each have a shank (29) which is adapted to seat in a

socket (23) formed in the original embedded
implant(24) whereby to support and locate the

respective dental prosthesis relative to the jawbone,
characterised in that the angle of a head (28A, 46 and

47) of each core (28,45) of the range, relative to
its shank (29) is different from the angle by which

the head (28A, 46 and 47) of each of the other cores
(28,45) of the range is oriented relative to its

respective shank (29) the model being used by a
process of trial and error, during which the shank

(29) of a core (28,45) under trial is located in the
standard socket (23) of the substitute implant, to

identify the angle of shank (29) relative to the head
(28A 46 and 47) of the core (28,45) that is required

for the selected core head (28A, 46 and 47) to be
oriented as required relative to the jawbone when its

shank (29) is located in the standard socket of the
original embedded implant (24). 
A method according to claim 5, wherein the
shanks (29) of the cores (28,45) are provided with

means (32) for engagement in a corresponding portion
(23) of the standard socket (23,23A) of the embedded

implant (24) to inhibit angular displacement of a
core (28,45) relative to an implant (24) in which its

shank (29) is socketed.
A method according to claim 5 or claim 6, wherein
the angle of the head (28A) of 
each core (28,45) of
