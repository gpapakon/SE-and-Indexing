<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to mammalian hematopoietic facilitatory cells (FC). In particular, it relates to the isolation, characterization and uses of the FC. The FC of the present invention can be distinguished from all other known bone marrow cells by their morphology, cell surface phenotype and (in vivo) function. It has now been established that purified hematopoietic stem cells alone or bone marrow cells depleted of FC do not readily engraft in a recipient. When co-administered with other bone marrow cells, especially the hematopoietic stem cells into a recipient, the FC enhance their engraftment, without apparent adverse biologic activities. In fact, the ability of the FC to enhance the engraftment of bone marrow cells in establishing lymphohematopoietic chimerism without producing graft versus host disease also induces donor-specific tolerance to permit the permanent acceptance of donor's cells, tissues and organs. Therefore, FC may have a wide range of applications, including, but not limited to, hematopoietic reconstitution by bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of cancers, anemias, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, viral infections and metabolic disorders as well as facilitation of solid organ, tissue and cellular transplantation.

 HEMATOPOIETIC FACILITATORY CELLS AND THEIR USES1. INTRODUCTION The present invention relates to mammalian hematopoietic facilitatory cells (FC) . In particular, it relates to the isolation, characterization and uses of the FC. The FC of the present invention can be distinguished from all other known bone marrow cells by their morphology, cell surface phenotype and in vivo function. It has now been established that purified hematopoietic stem cells alone or bone marrow cells depleted of FC do not readily engraft in a recipient. When co-administered with other bone marrow cells, especially the hematopoietic stem cells into a recipient, the FC enhance their engraftment, without apparent adverse biologic activities. In fact, the ability of the FC to enhance the engraftment of bone marrow cells in esablishing lymphohe atopoietic chimerism without producing graft versus host disease also induces donor-specific tolerance to permit the permanent acceptance of donor's cells, tissues and organs. Therefore, FC may have a wide range of applications, including, but not_ limited to, hematopoietic reconstitution by bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of cancers, anemias, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, viral infections and metabolic disorders as well as facilitation of solid organ, tissue and cellular transplantation.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A major goal in solid organ transplantation is the engraftment of the donor organ without a graft rejection immune response generated by the recipient, while preserving the immunocompetence of the recipient 

against other foreign antigens. Typically, nonspecific immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, steroids and FK506 are used to prevent host rejection responses. They must be administered on a daily basis and if stopped, graft rejection usually results. However, nonspecific immunosuppressive agents function by suppressing all aspects of the immune response, thereby greatly increasing a recipient's susceptibility to infections and diseases, including cancer. Furthermore, despite the use of immunosuppressive agents, graft rejection still remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in human organ transplantation. Only 50% of heart transplants survive 5 years and 20% of kidney transplants survive 10 years. (See Powles, 1980, Lancet. p. 327; Ramsay, 1982, New Enσl. J. Med.. p. 392) . Most human transplants fail within 10 years without permanent acceptance. It would therefore be a major advance if tolerance can be induced in the
