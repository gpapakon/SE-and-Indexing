<CLAIMS>
Method of setting and controlling a sheet-processing 
machine with a locating table and possibly a folding 

mechanism, in which the length of a sheet (11) is 
measured by means of a first transducer (1) and of a 

second transducer (2) coupled to a drive element (3) of 
the machine, and the measured sheet length is stored and 

is used as a reference sheet length for monitoring and 
control, characterized in that, on a thread sealing 

machine, the maximum possible number of thread stitches 
is determined and set in dependence on the measured 

length of a folded sheet (11) and on the fixed thread-stitch 
spacing of the thread sealing machine. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that, 
with a plurality of transducers along the path of 

transportation of the folded sheet (11) in the thread 
sealing machine, possibly adjustable along the path of 

transportation, the distance between the transducers is 
measured by comparison with the length measurement of the 

folded sheet (11) determined, and is stored and utilized 
for the monitoring and control of the thread sealing 

machine.
