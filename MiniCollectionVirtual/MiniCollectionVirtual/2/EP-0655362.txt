<ABSTRACT>
In a slip control system for a vehicle a slip 
ratio of driving wheels of the vehicle is detected, and 

the slip of the driving wheels is controlled to converge 
on a predetermined target slip ratio when the slip ratio 

of the driving wheels exceeds a predetermined threshold 
slip ratio. When the vehicle is running a rough road, 

the threshold slip ratio is increased. The running 
condition of the vehicle is detected and increase of the 

threshold slip ratio is inhibited depending on the 
running condition of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rough road detecting
system according to the preamble of claim 1. A
system of this type is known from US-A-4,672,547.
The wheel speed variations, specifically the wheel
decelaration and the wheel acceleration are
detected and analyzed. If e.g. the wheel
acceleration is above a threshold value, shock
absorber control, power steering control and the
like are modified accordingly.There have been put into practice slip control
systems for a vehicle such as a traction control system
and an antiskid control system.In the traction control, the slip ratio of the
driving wheels of the vehicle is detected, and when the
slip ratio exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the
engine output power and/or the braking force are
controlled (the engine output power is reduced and/or the
braking force is increased) so that the slip ratio of the
driving wheels converges on a target slip ratio in order
to prevent the driving wheels from slipping due to
excessively large driving force, for instance, during
acceleration, thereby ensuring better acceleration
performance. In the antiskid control, the slip ratio of the
wheels of the vehicle is detected, and when the slip
ratio exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the
braking force is controlled (reduced) so that the slip
ratio of the driving wheels converges on a target slip
ratio in order to prevent the wheels from locking.Generally the slip ratio of each wheel is
determined on the basis of the peripheral speed of the
wheel. Accordingly, in the case of the traction control
system, when the vehicle is running a rough road and the
peripheral speed of each wheel fluctuates due to
uneveness on the road surface, the slip ratio can
frequently exceed the predetermined threshold value and
the traction control can be performed when the running
condition of the vehicle does not require the traction
control, whereby the driving force is frequently reduced
and the acceleration performance deteriorates.In the case of the antiskid control system, a
more efficient braking can tale place when locking
tendency of the wheels is enhanced so that the wheels
catch the uneveness on the road surface than when the
antiskid control is performed and the slip ratio is
converged on the target slip ratio so long as the vehicle
is running a rough road.Thus, in either of the traction control and the
antiskid control, it is preferred that the threshold slip
ratio be higher to a certain extent when the vehicle is
running a rough road than when the vehicle is running a 
smooth

<CLAIMS>
A rough road detecting system for detecting whether a wheel of
a vehicle is running a rough road comprising a wheel acceleration

detecting means (64-67, UTR) which detects the rotational acceleration of the
wheel, and a comparing means wherein the rotational acceleration of the wheel is

analysed, said comparing means compares the
frequency (PCFL) at which the acceleration of the wheel oscillates over

a predetermined threshold value (α, -α) in a unit time with a
predetermined frequency and determines that the wheel is running a

rough road when the former is larger than the latter, characterized in that a braking
detecting means (73) detects application of brake to the wheel, and a

threshold value changing means (UTR) changes the threshold value
according to whether the brake is applied to the wheel so that the

threshold value is larger when the brake is applied to the wheel than
when the brake is not applied to the wheel.
The system of claim 1, comprising frequency determining means for
determining the frequency at which the wheel oscillates over said predetermined

threshold value, wherein said frequency determining means
comprises counter means for counting the number of events of the wheel

acceleration exceeding said threshold value (α, -α) under the condition
that a positive acceleration value exceeding a positive threshold value

(α) is followed by a negative acceleration value exceeding a negative
threshold value (-α) and vice versa.
The system of claim 1 or 2, comprising a left rough road detecting
means which detects whether the left wheel is running a rough road on

the basis of change in the speed of the left wheel, a right rough road
detecting means which detects whether the right wheel is running a

rough road on the basis of chance in the speed of the right wheel, a first 
determining means which determines that the vehicle is running a rough

road when at least one of the left and right rough road detecting means
detects that the wheel is turning a rough road, and a second determining

means which determines that the vehicle is running a rough road when
the left and right rough road detecting means both detect that the wheel

is running a rough road.
The system of claim 3, comprising a rough road correction means

which selects one of the first and second determining means according
to the running condition of the vehicle for the kind of the slip control to

be effected by a slip control means and changes the contents of the slip
control effected by the slip control means when the selected determining

means determines that the vehicle is turning a rough road.
The system as defined in claim 4 in which said rough road correction
means selects the first determining means when the slip control to

be effected by the slip control means is an antiskid control.
The system as defined in claim 4 in which said rough road correction
means selects the first determining means when the slip control to

be effected by the slip control means is a traction control and the
amount of depression of the accelerator pedal is not larger than a predetermined

value.
The system as defined in claim 4 in which said rough road correction
means selects the second determining means when the slip control

to be effected by the slip control means is a traction control and the
amount of depression of the accelerator pedal is larger than a predetermined

value.
