<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of determining the integrity of an instrument and the 
data signals that it generates representing the amount of microbial growth in a fluid 

specimen, such as blood, wherein the specimen and a culture medium are introduced into a 
sealable container and exposed to conditions enabling metabolic processes to take place in 

the presence of microorganisms. An integrity testing module is used to perform the 
integrity tests on the data signals and determines whether the data signals from each sensing 

station are within predetermined parameters and, more particularly, directly detects data 
signal instabilities that degrade microbial growth detection performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and method of testing the
integrity of data signals concerning microbial growth in a fluid specimen and, more
particularly, relates to testing the integrity of an instrument and the signals it
generates representing the amount of microbial growth in a fluid specimen, such as
blood, wherein the specimen and a culture medium are introduced into a sealable
container and exposed to conditions enabling metabolic processes to take place in
the presence of microorganisms.Usually, the presence of microorganisms such as bacteria in a patient's body
fluid, particularly blood, is determined using blood culture vials. A small quantity of
blood is injected through a sealing septum into a sterile vial containing a culture
medium. The vial is then placed in an instrument, wherein the vial is agitated and 
incubated at a temperature conducive to bacterial growth, e.g., 37Â°C and monitored for
such growth.Known instrumental methods detect changes in the CO2 content in the
headspace of the culture vials, which is a metabolic by-product of the bacterial growth.
Monitoring the CO2 content can be accomplished by conventional methods, including
radiochemical, infrared absorption at a CO2 spectral line, or pressure/vacuum
measurement. These methods, however, require invasive procedures which can result
in cross-contamination between vials.Recently, novel non-invasive monitoring methods have been developed which
use sensors inside a culture vial. Such sensors often respond to changes in the CO2
concentration by outputting an optical signal corresponding to the change in CO2
concentration. Therefore, errors in receiving and measuring the optical signal being
output by the sensor will occur, if the light sources used to excite the sensors, or the
photodetectors used to monitor the optical signal, exhibit excessive noise, are interfered
with by dirt, or otherwise malfunction. In addition, errors in measuring the optical
signal may also be caused by vial misplacement, failure of electronic or optical
components in a blood culturing instrument, or ambient light leakage into a sensing
station.If an abnormal signal variation or malfunction occurs at the sensing station or
any other subsystem in the instrument, while it is measuring and recording data from a
vial, it is important to reject the erroneous data and notify a system user of the
malfunction as soon as possible. Therefore, data signals associated with the status of
the instrument and data signals associated with the
