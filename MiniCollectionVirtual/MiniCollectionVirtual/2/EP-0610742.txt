<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel process for obtaining tocopherols and sterols from natural sources, in particular plant sources. In particular, this process is a process for separating tocopherols and sterols from vapour condenser fats by distillation of these vapour condenser fats by esterifying the sterols present in the vapour condenser fat with the likewise present fatty acids before distillation, distilling the resulting mixture for the purpose of recovering residual fatty acids and subsequently for the purpose of recovering tocopherols, the sterol esters formed during the esterification remaining in the residue of this distillation, and then isolating the tocopherols from the distillate and the sterols, after cleavage of their esters, from the distillation residue.

A process for the separation of tocopherols and sterols from
deodorizer sludges by the distillation of this deodorizer sludge, characterized

by, prior to the distillation, esterifying the sterols present in the deodorizer
sludge with the fatty acids which are also present, distilling the resulting

mixture to obtain residual fatty acids and subsequently to obtain tocopherols,
whereby the sterol esters formed in the esterification remain in the residue of

this distillation, and then isolating the tocopherols from the distillate and
isolating the sterols, after cleavage of their esters, from the distillation

residue.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
deodorizer sludge is esterified by heating at a temperature of about 150°C to

about 250°C for about 1 to 12 hours.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in that the heating
is carried out at a temperature of about 150°C to about 220°C.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in that the heating
is carried out at about 180°C/2.5 hours to about 250°C/1.5 hours.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that a distillate from the deodorization of sunflower oil, soya oil or palm oil

is used as the deodorizer sludge.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the deodorizer sludge is de-gassed prior to the esterification.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the esterification is carried out at normal pressure.
