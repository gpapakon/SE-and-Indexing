<ABSTRACT>
The range of a digital cellular radio cell is extended by providing first and 
second communication paths in which the second communication 

path receives signals from outside the range (D1) of the first path, the 
synchronization of the second path signals being delayed by an amount equal to 

the additional transmission delay (T‚ÇÅ). Each communication 
path is provided with its own antenna (A,B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for extending the range of radio 
coverage in a TDMA system. The invention will be described with reference to 
a digital GSM cellular-radio system using TDMA, but it is applicable to TDMA 
systems generally. Radio TDMA systems are particularly useful where a central receiver 
deals with a plurality of remote transmitters. However, the distance between 
the remote transmitters and the central receiver introduces propagation delay 
which varies in direct proportion to the distances the mobile is located from the 
base station. To prevent adjacent transmissions from remote transmitters overlapping 
in time due to propagation delay it is necessary to introduce guard bands 
between remote transmitter transmission. Further, to maximise information 
throughput it is well known that each individual remote transmitter can be 
instructed to advance the starting time of its transmission in order to 
compensate for the propagation delay. If this is done, then the guard band 
between remote transmitter transmissions can be reduced. Cellular-radio telephone systems divide a coverage area into a plurality of 
contiguous cells each served by a base station. In urban areas, the coverage 
of each cell may be only a few kilometres in diameter, cell size being reduced as 
the communication traffic density increases. As the traffic density decreases the size of the cells can be increased. 
The protocol adopted by GSM permits mobiles to advance their timing by a 
maximum of 63 communication bits equivalent to approximately 35 kilometres. 
Once the mobile exceeds this distance it cannot be instructed to advance its 
timing any further. Consequently the base station receiver will eventually be 
unable to correlate the received mobile transmission once the timing advance 
becomes too great. In some GSM systems, this may be only 4-6 bits greater 
than the maximum timing advance (63 bits). An option available with some communication systems including GSM is 
the provision of a diversity receive antenna at the base station which will  
 
receive signals from a different direction from the main beam antenna. In particular, in some systems the diversity advantage is applied after 
demodulate and decoding. This is referred to as baseband sort combining and 
implies that two separate receiver chains are maintained in the base station 
from the RF input until baseband recombination. This invention proposes an arrangement for increasing the maximum 
range of a TDMA communication system having
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for increasing the maximum range of a TDMA 
communication system having antenna means providing a first coverage area 

having a first radius, the first radius being equal to or less than the maximum 
TDMA radius, and a second coverage area having a radius greater than the first 

radius, wherein signals received from the first coverage area are processed in a 
first receiver, wherein the signals received from the second coverage area are 

processed in a second receiver with a delay with respect to the signals 
processed by the f
irst receiver. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein the delay is equal to the 
transmission time over the distance of the first radius. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein a first antenna provides 
coverage of the first area and a second antenna provides coverage of the 

second area. 
An arrangement for increasing the maximum range of a TDMA 
communication system substantially as herein described with reference to the 

accompanying drawing. 
A method of increasing the range of a TDMA communication system In 
which the timing of the transmissions from the mobile stations to the base station 

is adjustable within a range having a predetermined maximum duration which 
permits communication between the base station and mobiles located within a first 

radius of the base station, the method including providing first receive means at the 
base station to receive transmissions from mobiles within the first radius, and 

providing one or more additional receive means, a first of the additional receive 
means being delayed with respect to the first receive means by an amount not 

greater than the predetermined maximum duration, each of the remaining additional 
cells, if any, being delayed by progressively greater periods to provide concentric 

overlapping or contiguous coverage areas. 
A method of increasing the range of a TDMA communication system 
substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
