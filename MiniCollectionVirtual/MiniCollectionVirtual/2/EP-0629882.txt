<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of active detection with a laser source, more particularly to the detection of high-voltage cables. The lidar according to the invention includes means (1) for transmitting a laser beam (10) along a sighting axis ( DELTA ), means for optical multiplexing (4) of this beam in order to create n transmission and reception light channels, means (2, 3) of separating the energy transmitted and the energy received by backscattering of the beam (10) on an obstacle (C), means of receiving (6 to 8) and of processing (9) the energy received in order to deliver a signal to visual display means, and visual display means, scanning means (5) common to the transmission (1) and reception (6 to 8) means. Application to helicopter flying.

Lidar which includes means (1) for emitting a 
light energy beam (10) along a line of sight, means (5) 

for scanning the light energy beam (10) in a field of 
view (CH) for detecting, in this field, obstacles which 

send back at least some of the energy to the emission 
means as an echo, and means (6 to 8) for receiving the 

energy thus sent back, the scanning means (5) being 
common to the emission (1) and reception (6 to 8) means, 

means (2, 3) for splitting the emitted energy and the 
received energy, and a processing circuit (9), the lidar 

being characterized in that it includes means (4) for 
optically multiplexing the light energy beam (10) in 

order to create n emission and reception light channels 
coupled to the reception, and means (8) for detecting the 

reflected light energy originating from each of the light 
emission channels, the detection means (8) delivering n 

signals to the processing circuit (9), thus multiplying 
the image repetition rate by a factor n, and thus being 

a high-rate lidar operating with a low-rate laser source. 
Lidar according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the splitting means comprise a quarter-wave plate (3) and 

a polarizing splitter cube (2), these being arranged, at 
emission, between the emission means (1) and the scanning 

means (5) and, at reception, between the scanning means 
(5) and the reception means (6 to 8). 
Lidar according to either of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the optical multiplexing 

means (4) include an afocal system (40) comprising at 
least one cylindrical lens (L1) divergent in a given  

 
plane (H) so that the emitted beam (10) has a principal 

divergence nβ in this plane (H) and a divergence β in a 
plane (V) orthogonal to the given plane (H) in order to 

constitute n light channels with divergence β x β, and in 
that the reception means (6 to 8) include a focusing lens 

(6) coupled to a linear detection array (8) consisting of 
n detectors (D1 to Dn), each detector having dimensions 

(1 x 1) corresponding to the divergence (β x β) of each 
light channel
 carrying the light energy detected. 
Lidar according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the optical multiplexing means (4) 

consist of means (L1 to Ln) for dividing the emitted 
laser beam (10) into n beams (F1 to Fn) in n separate 

directions (S1 to Sn) in order to form n light channels 
of divergence (β x β) in each light channel. 
Lidar according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the splitting means consist of splitter plates (L1 to 

Ln), each plate having a reflection coefficient chosen to 
transmit the same proportion of peak power (Po/n) and 

having an orientation chosen so that the emitted beams 
(F1 to Fn) are directed along the n separate directions 

(S1 to Sn). 
Lidar according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the scanning means (5) consist of 

two counter-rotating diasporometers in order to form a 
scan pattern (F) over the field of view (HD). 
Lidar according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the reception means (6 to 8) 

include an interference filter (7) in order to transmit 
only a wavelength range centred around the emission 

wavelength of the laser source (1). 
Lidar according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the reception means (6 to 8) 

deliver a signal (80) to the said circuit, the processing 
circuit (9) carrying out rangefinding measurements of the 

objects detected and delivering a signal to suitable 
display means when shape criteria are satisfied. 
Lidar according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the emission means (1)  

 
consist of a single laser source.
