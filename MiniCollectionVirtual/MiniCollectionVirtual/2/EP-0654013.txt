<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the preparation of ferric chloride using hydrochloric acid as the sole source of chlorine. According to the invention, the process comprises oxychlorinating, by means of hydrochloric acid and oxygen, ferrous chloride into ferric chloride, after which a portion of the ferric chloride is recycled in order to attack the iron and convert it into ferrous chloride.

Process for the preparation of ferric chloride from 
hydrochloric acid and iron, characterized in that: 


a) ferrous chloride is brought into contact with 
hydrochloric acid and oxygen until almost all of the 

hydrochloric acid has disappeared, 
b) a portion (i) of the solution obtained in a) is 
brought into contact with iron in order to convert the 

ferric chloride and the iron to ferrous chloride, and 
this solution is recycled to step a), 
c) the other portion (ii) of the solution obtained in 
a), which consists essentially of ferric chloride and 

which may contain ferrous chloride, is optionally brought 
into contact with oxygen and a sufficient quantity of 

hydrochloric acid to convert the ferrous chloride to 
ferric chloride.
