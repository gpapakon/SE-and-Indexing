<ABSTRACT>
The plug connector consists of two housing parts, namely a plug receptacle (2) and a plug (3) as well as an additional slide (4), all of which form a step-up drive with one another, via tooth systems. A gearwheel (7) is mounted, such that it can rotate, on one of the three parts and engages with in each case one rack (toothed rod) (25, 45) on the two other parts (2, 4). In this way, it is possible to convert a linear movement of the slide (4) into a movement, which is likewise linear, of the plug (3) while at the same time stepping up the insertion force with any desired step-up ratio.
