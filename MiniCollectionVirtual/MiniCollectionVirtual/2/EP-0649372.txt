<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a laminated foil, the raw materials of which can be separated and recovered. The bond (14) between the layers (12, 16) of the laminate keeps the layers together when no external force is exerted on the layers, but allows the layers to be separated from each other either by hand or mechanically. Bondless edges (22) have been formed on the foil, i.e. the bonding material has been removed from the edge in order to facilitate the separation of the layers. A foil like this can be cut into blanks to be used as wrappings in packing. Preferably the bondless edges are formed at the packing machine. Thereby it is easy for the consumer to get a hold of the pre-separated edges (32) of the layers and to separate the layers from each other by pulling them apart by hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated foil, 
especially for packing purposes, the foil being produced 
as an endless web from at least two webs of different 
kinds of foils, from which foil it is convenient to cut 
rectangular blanks to be used as packings, as wide as the 
original endless foil. The packing industry has lately paid considerably 
attention to the recovery and recyclability of packing 
materials. For example, publication WO 92/00190 discloses 
a container for foodstuffs, which container is made of a 
plastic-covered metal foil, the thickness of the foil 
being of the order of some Âµm. The container can be 
recycled by melting the metal, whereby the plastic is 
combusted into carbon dioxide, and the separated metal 
can be re-used. This kind of method of recycling is not 
always worth applying, but it is advisable to try to get 
the different materials of the container separated so 
that the materials can be recycled separately. Laminates comprising layers of different materials are 
being widely used as wrappings. Such laminates are 
disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0374629, which relates to 
transparent laminates made from polymers having a high 
content of hydroxyl groups and having a thermoplastic 
polyurethaneurea as an adhesive layer. The layers of 
different materials should be able of being separated 
simply and easily for recovery. Butter, margarine or the 
like are packed for retail purposes to parchment-wax-Al-foil 
laminates and to parchment-Al-PE-foil laminates. 
Aluminium foil is popular in packings of this kind 
because of its foldability. This is important when there 
are no other means of closing besides folding. It is easy 
to fold a foil so that it stays tightly folded against 
the product. Besides, metallized plastic foils have very 
desirable properties for many packing applications, 
especially for foodstuff packing, as the layer of metal  
 
prevents the penetration of humidity, oxygen and smells. 
Thus, metallized foils are very popular packing 
materials, but still no methods of making them easily 
recyclable have been disclosed. It is imperative that the 
laminate layers can be easily and quickly separated by 
the consumer. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
laminated foil for correcting the above-mentioned 
drawbacks, i.e. to provide for an easy separation of 
packing laminates for further treatment, if any, of the 
different materials. Thus, the present invention relates to a laminated foil 
for packing purposes in accordance with claim
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A laminated foil (10a) for packing purposes, the foil 
being made as an endless web of at least two different webs 

of foil or layers kept together by a bonding material (14), 
which laminated foil is capable of being cut into preferably 

rectangular blanks having the same width as the endless web, 

characterized
 in that the strength of the bond realised by 
the bonding material (14) is of 2-15 N/m, and that the 

bonding material keeping the layers together has been applied 
to essentially all other surfaces of the foil between the 

layers except at least one of the longitudinal edges (28) of the web, 
which edge is therefore a bondless edge (22). 
A laminated foil according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the or each bondless edge is formed by breaking the bond between 
the layers (12, 16) by means of a suitable tool (20). 
A laminated foil according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the width (24) of the edge (22) is 
about 10 mm. 
A laminated foil according to any of claims 1-3, 

characterized in that
 the laminated foil consists of an 
aluminium foil (12) and a plastic foil (16). 
A laminated foil according to claim 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the bond (14) between the layers (12, 16) is formed by 
means of a wax-based bonding material.  

 
A blank made of the foil described in any of claims 1-5. 
Use of a blank according to claim 6 for making of a 
wrapping or a wrapped packing. 
A method of producing a laminated foil (10a), in which 
method an endless web (10) of laminated foil comprising at 

least two different layers bonded together in a manner known 
per se, from which blanks can be cut, preferably 

rectangular, having the same width as the endless foil, is 
directed to a packing machine, 
characterized in that
 the bond 
(14) between the layers is broken along at least one of the edges 

(28) of the 
endless web at a preset depth for forming a bondless edge 

(22) before the blanks are formed, the strength of the bond 
being 2-15 N/m. 
A method according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the 
bondless area is formed by means of a tool arranged at the 

packing machine, the tool comprising a blade-like part or a 
rotating disc (20).
