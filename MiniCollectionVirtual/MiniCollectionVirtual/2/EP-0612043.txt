<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet discriminating
apparatus to be installed in a sheet counting machine or
the like for discriminating sheets such as bills or bank
notes (hereinafter referred to collectively as "bills") by
kind.There are known sheet discriminating apparatuses for
discriminating among kinds of sheets by detecting the length
of the sheets in the direction perpendicular to the sheet
conveyance direction. For example, Japanese Utility Model
Application laid open No. 63-80682 discloses a sheet discriminating
apparatus using a CCD line sensor as light
receiving elements arranged in the direction perpendicular
to the sheet conveyance direction. In this sheet discriminating
apparatus, the outputs of the line sensor are digitized
for storage in a memory as image data. After the
storage of the image data for the number of lines necessary
for discriminating the kind of sheet, but before discrimination
by use of pattern matching, the kind of sheet is
preliminarily determined by detecting its length in the
direction perpendicular to the conveyance direction. On the
other hand, a characterizing area having a distinctive
characteristic suitable for discriminating the kind of sheet
is determined beforehand for each kind of sheet, and the 
Position of the characterizing area in the sheet is stored in the memory for each kind
of sheet. The pattern corresponding to the characterizing area is also stored in the
memory as reference pattern data for each kind of sheet. After the preliminary determination
of the kind of sheet, the final discrimination of the kind of sheet is conducted
by extracting the image data of the characterizing area from the sheet and comparing
it with the reference pattern data for the kind of sheet preliminarily determined.A similar system is disclosed in patent application GB 2107911 which describes a
currency note validator operating on the basis of infrared and visible colour reflectance
readings and opacity readings which are taken along several longitudinally extending
tracks of the note to be examined. A microprocessor normalizes the reflectance
readings in order to accommodate variations in soiling, discoloration and damage of
the notes. Preprogrammed acceptance band data are used for comparison of the
selected reflectance readings and opacity readings for any type of currency note to
be validated by the microprocessor.Document WO 92/17857 discloses a currency note width detector which enables the
determination of the width of the traveling notes or documents by means of
