<ABSTRACT>
A package (20) for housing and mixing two materials, 
such as epoxy resin and polyamine adduct, together to form 

an adhesive. Two sheets (26, 28) are joined together to 
form the outer periphery (50) of the bag. A third sheet 

(30) is secured between the outer sheets (26, 28) and 
divides the package into two compartments (32, 34). One 

compartment (32) includes a line of perforation holes (82) 
that are easily ruptured when a user applies pressure to 

the external area of the compartment (32). A cap (90) 
covers the perforation holes (82) so that the material 

contained within the rupturable bag will not leak into the 
other compartment (34). When the one compartment (32) is 

ruptured, the adduct that is contained therein is released 
into the other compartment (34) and mixes with the resin. 

After the two materials are completely mixed the adhesive 
is ready for use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a 
package for mixing two materials together to form a 
compound. More particularly, the package has two 
compartments with each holding a separate material. A 
weakened area in one of the compartments breaks under 
external pressure to facilitate the mixing of the 
materials. Prior art packages use a bag-in-bag type apparatus for 
mixing two materials together. For example, an inner 
rupturable bag is surrounded by an outer sealed bag. When 
pressure is applied to the exterior of the outer bag, a 
seal in the inner bag ruptures under the pressure and 
releases the material contained within the inner bag. The 
contents of the inner bag and the contents of the outer bag 
mix together to form the completed mixture. This type of prior art bag, however, has several 
disadvantages. It uses a substantial amount of material to 
make the completed bag since it uses two separate bags. 
Also, it is difficult to break the inner bag since a seal 
must be ruptured to release the inner bag's contents. The present invention is intended to overcome or 
minimize all of these problems, as well as to present 
several other advantages. According to this invention a plural compartment 
package for mixing materials therein, comprises:
 
   a first sheet;
 
   a second sheet overlapping said first sheet:
 
   said first and second sheets being joined together 
such that an area is defined therein;
 
   a third sheet;
 
   said third sheet being located between and joined to 
said first and second sheets such that a first compartment 
for holding a first material is defined between said third 
sheet and said first sheet and a second compartment for  
 
holding a second material is defined between said second 
and third sheets, and
 
   said third sheet having a weakened area which is 
rupturable upon the application of pressure thereto for 
enabling the materials to mix together. The present invention provides an improved package 
that allows a user easily and quickly to mix the two 
materials. The bag uses two separate compartments for 
holding the materials and one compartment is easily 
rupturable. However, leaking between the two compartments 
is prevented so that the materials do not mix together 
before the one compartment is ruptured. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention 
provides a package for housing and mixing two materials, 
such as epoxy resin and polyamine adduct, together to form 
an adhesive. The third sheet includes a line of perforation 
holes that are

<CLAIMS>
A plural compartment package for mixing materials 
therein, comprising: 

   a first sheet (26); 
   a second sheet (28) overlapping said first sheet (26): 

   said first and second sheets being joined together 
such that an area (36) is defined therein; 

   a third sheet (30); 
   said third sheet being located between and joined to 

said first (26) and second (28) sheets such that a first 
compartment (32) for holding a first material is defined 

between said third sheet (30) and said first sheet (26) and 
a second compartment (34) for holding a second material is 

defined between said second (28) and third (30) sheets, 
and 

   said third sheet (30) having a weakened area (80) 
which is rupturable upon the application of pressure 

thereto for enabling the materials to mix together. 
A plural compartment package as defined in claim 1, 
further including a thin membrane (90) attached to said 

weakened area (80). 
A plural compartment package as defined in claim 2, 
wherein said membrane (90) is frangible. 
A plural compartment package as defined in claim 2 
wherein said membrane (90) is sealed to said weakened area 

(80) by a light adhesive such that when said weakened area 
(80) is broken under pressure, the light adhesive material 

releases the membrane. 
A plural compartment package as defined in claim 2 or 
3, wherein said membrane (90) is extruded onto said third 

sheet. 
A plural compartment package as defined in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein said third sheet (30) has 

three sides attached to said first (26) and second sheets 
(28) and a fourth side substantially attached to only said 

first sheet (26). 
A plural compartment package as defined in any 
preceding claim, wherein said weakened area (80) has 

perforations (82). 
A plural compartment package as defined in any 
preceding claim, wherein the sheets (26, 28, 30) are 

joined together by a heat seal. 
A plural compartment package as defined in any 
preceding claim, wherein said first and second sheets (26, 

28) are thicker than said third sheet (30). 
A plural compartment package in accordance with any 
one of the preceding claims containing a two-part material 

such as an adhesive, a first material, such as a polyamine 
adduct, being held in the first compartment (32) and a 

second material, such as an epoxy resin, being held in 
the second compartment (34).
