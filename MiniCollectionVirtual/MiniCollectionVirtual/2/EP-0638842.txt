<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the hardening of gelatin-containing
layers and in particular to the hardening of
gelatin-containing photographic layers and to
photographic elements containing such layers.The chemical crosslinking of gelatin is a critical
part of producing photographically useful silver halide
films. The crosslinking imparts numerous advantages on
the coated film through reducing the degree of swelling
of the emulsion layer in water, and by increasing the so-called
'melting point' of the gelatin. Improvements in
physical characteristics include more resistance to
scratching and reduced tendency to become soft or tacky.
Suitable hardeners for use in gelatin-containing
photographic layers should have no significant
detrimental effects on other parameters of the film,
e.g., sensitometry.A number of gelatin crosslinkers are known and find
use as hardeners in photographic applications. A
commonly used hardener, particularly in photographic
elements for Graphic Arts, is formaldehyde. This
material is an effective gelatin crosslinker, but has a
number of disadvantages which are increasingly of
importance, such as the inter-related problems of
toxicity and volatility (both in the factory and for the
customer) and after-hardening effects. The latter means
that it can take some time, often weeks, for the gelatin
to reach its final hardness. Since the sensitometric
properties of the film depend on film hardness, it is
desirable for the hardening process to be complete soon
after coating, preferably within one week, for quality
control purposes in the manufacturing plant.Other hardening agents, such as vinyl sulphones,
require elaborate multi-step syntheses for their
production which increases the cost of the hardening
agents. Also some gelatin hardeners can react with 
other compounds in the photographic construction, for
example antihalation dyes and colour couplers making them
unacceptable for use in many photographic elements.A number of gelatin hardeners containing phosphorus
are known.JP 57044140 discloses pyridinium quaternary salts of
substituted aliphatic phosphates:

where A is a l-alkyl or l-aryl pyridinium or quinolinium
quaternary salt residue.JP 58-113929 also discloses the use of
organophosphorus compounds of the following formula as
gelatin hardeners:

where X is halogen, Y is O, S, or CH2:USP 4668616 discloses the following triaminophosphonium
salts as gelatin hardeners:

where X is a leaving group to be released on reaction of
the compound with a nucleophilic reagent.USP 5073480
