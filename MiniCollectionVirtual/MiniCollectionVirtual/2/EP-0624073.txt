<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a refraction device (10) for the subjective determination of the spherical and astigmatic sight properties of the eye (12) of a patient having a beam dividing device (14) for two partial beam paths (18). In each partial beam path (18) there is a cylindrical compensator (22) which has at least one plus cylinder lens (24) and at least one minus cylinder lens (26). The or each plus and minus cylinder lens (24, 26) of each cylindrical compensator (22) are movable in relation to one another by means of a first drive device (28) to determine the cylindricity. Each cylindrical compensator (22) is rotatable by means of a second drive device for determining the cylinder axis. The spheres can be adjusted by means of a commercially available phoropter or a plate (52) with spherical lenses (54) or a range selector plate (106) with spherical lenses (108) or by adjusting the focal point of condensing lenses (114, 118) on the principle of the astronomical telescope.
