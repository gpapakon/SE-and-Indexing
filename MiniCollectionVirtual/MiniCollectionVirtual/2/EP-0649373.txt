<ABSTRACT>
A laminated body panel for aircraft applications comprises first and second metal layers and an adhesive layer. First and second sections in each metal layer are generally coplanar and separated by a splice line. A first splice line in a first metal layer is generally parallel to a second splice line in a second metal layer, and spaced laterally from the second splice line. An adhesive layer between the metal layers preferably contains reinforcing fibers bridging across the splice lines. An aircraft fuselage or wing or empennage made with spliced body panels of the invention has fewer joints and weights less than one made with narrower body panels containing unspliced metal layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laminated metal-polymer-metal panels 
suitable for aircraft applications. More particularly, the invention relates to splicing such 
laminated panels in order to reduce the number of joints between adjacent panels in an 
aircraft fuselage or wing or empennage. Metal-polymer laminates for aircraft applications are known in the prior art. 
For example, Schijve et al U.S. Patents 4,489,123 and 4,500,589 disclose laminates 
reinforced with aromatic polyamide fibers, and Vogelesang et al U.S. Patent 5,039,571 
discloses a laminate reinforced with S2-glass fibers. These laminates are being accepted 
for some aircraft applications because they generally have better mechanical properties 
and lower specific gravity than aluminum alloys. In addition, they are available at lower 
cost than fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites. Metal-polymer laminates for aircraft applications are presently limited to a 
maximum width of approximately 152 centimeters (60 inches). This maximum width 
results from the fact that metal sheet material in the specific alloys, tempers and 
thicknesses needed for aircraft laminates is restricted by present manufacturing 
technology to a maximum width of only about 152-165 centimeters (60-65 inches). The weight of an aircraft fuselage increases in direct relationship with the 
number of joints between adjacent body panels in the fuselage. The number of joints is 
inversely related to the width of the body panels. Accordingly, increasing the width of 
aircraft body panels by splicing or otherwise will directly reduce the fuselage weight. Although the desirability of splicing adjacent laminated panels to increase 
their width is readily apparent, until the present invention, there has not yet been 
developed a satisfactory technique for increasing the width of such panels without 
detrimentally affecting their mechanical properties. A principal objective of the invention is to provide a laminated metal-polymer 
body panel for aircraft applications made with spliced metal layers and having 
satisfactory mechanical properties. Surprisingly, spliced laminates of the invention have 
increased residual strength compared with unspliced laminates. It is a related objective of the present invention to provide an aircraft 
structure such as a fuselage or wing or empennage, made with laminated metal-polymer 
body panels and having reduced weight. Another objective of the invention is to provide an aircraft structure made 
with laminated metal-polymer body panels

splice line between the first and second sections; 
(b) a second metal layer having a thickness of less 
than 1 mm and comprising a first section, a second 

section generally coplanar with the first section and a 
second splice line between the first and second sections, the 

second splice line being spaced laterally from the first 
splice line by at least several centimeters; and 
(c) a fiber reinforced adhesive layer between the 
first and second metal layers. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, wherein said 

first and second splice lines are generally parallel. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, wherein said 
metal layers have first and second lateral edges on opposite 

lateral sides of said splice lines, said first and second 
lateral edges being separated by a width of at least 

165 cm. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, having a 
rectangular shape with a length and a width and wherein the 

splice lines are generally parallel to the longer of the 
length and the width. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, wherein the 
metal layers each have a thickness of 0.2-0.5 mm. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, wherein the 
fibers constitute 35-75 vol.% of the total volume of adhesive 

and fibers combined. 
The panel in accordance with claim 1, wherein said 
metal layers are made from one or more metals selected from 

the group consisting of aluminum alloys, steel alloys, copper 
alloys, zinc alloys, titanium alloys, magnesium alloys and 

aluminum alloy matrix composites.

fibers are made from one or more materials selected from the 

group consisting of E-glass, R-glass, S2-glass or other types of 
glass, poly-paraphenyleneterephthalamide or other types of aramids, 

and carbon.
