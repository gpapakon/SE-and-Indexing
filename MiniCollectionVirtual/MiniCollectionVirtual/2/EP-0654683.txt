<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation imaging and in particular, it relates to an 
apparatus used for radiation detection. In the field of X-ray detection it is well-known to employ so-called 
intensifying screens to increase the radiation available for detection purposes. 
Such screens contain an X-ray luminescent material (e.g., phosphor) which is 
selected to emit a relatively large number of light photons for each X-ray photon 
striking the material. This effectively amplifies the X-rays to be detected since 
both the X-rays themselves and light emitted by X-ray-induced emission from the 
luminescent material are available for detection on film or other detection mediums 
or devices, such as arrays of light-sensitive electronic sensors (e.g., photodiodes, 
photoconductors, charge-coupled devices, etc.). The primary incentive to use such 
intensifying screens in medical applications is to reduce the amount of X-ray 
radiation which is required to produce a given exposure, thereby reducing the 
radiation risk to which a patient or operator is exposed. Detector panels envisioned for digital radiography ideally employ pixelized 
phosphor screens which are aligned with the electronic elements used to detect the 
photons generated when an X-ray interacts with the phosphor. In the use of digital 
radiographic screens for a majority of diagnostic X-rays, the pixel size that is 
required in order to obtain the necessary resolution is on the order of 85 microns. 
In the case of digital radiography for mammography, this pixel dimension 
decreases to the order of 40 microns. In any digital radiographic scheme which 
utilizes a pixelized phosphor to improve the resolution and isolation of adjacent 
pixels, the relative alignment of the two elements, the phosphor pixel and the 
detector pixel, becomes critical. Several schemes to eliminate this precise 
alignment of two components have centered around the direct formation of the 
phosphor pixels on the sensor pixels by the growth of a columnar phosphor over  
 
specific regions, or the cutting or ablating of phosphors deposited on sensing 
elements, into pixels . An alternative approach to pixelizing directly on the sensor device is to 
separately pixelize both a phosphor sheet and a sensor array. The two pixelized 
arrays are then joined together while insuring that the pixels are precisely aligned 
for the two layers. For example, the method used in U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,438 
utilizes a pixelized phosphor screen which is bonded to an array of detector 
elements. In
