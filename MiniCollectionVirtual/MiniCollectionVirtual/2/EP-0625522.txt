<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a benzopyran derivative which
promotes osteogenesis, a method of production thereof and use thereof.Osteoporosis is a pathologic state or disease involving some symptom or
risk due to quantitative reduction in bone exceeding a certain degree. Major
symptoms are spinal kyphosis, and fractures of dorsolumbar bones, vertebral
centra, femoral necks, distal end of radius, ribs, proximal end of humerus, and
others. In healthy bone tissue, bone destruction occurs constantly, with a
good balance between bone formation and resorption; osteoblasts and
osteoclasts play key roles in osteogenesis and bone resorption, respectively.
Bone resorption surpassing osteogenesis, upon deterioration of the bone
destruction balance therebetween, results in a quantitative reduction in bone.
Traditionally, bone resorption inhibitors such as estrogens, calcitonin and
bisphosphonates have been mainly used to treat osteoporosis. However, these
bone resorption inhibitors fail to have a satisfactory effect in some cases, due
to limitation on the subject or to uncertain efficacy. There is therefore a need
for a new osteogenesis substance which serves as a prophylactic/therapeutic
drug for osteoporosis, to increase once-decreased bone mass.There are numerous benzopyran derivatives, such as those listed in the
overview in the Progress in Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 9, p. 65 (1973). That
publication, however, does not describe the osteogenesis-promoting action of
4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxamide derivatives. Nor is any such
derivative known that has a substitutional group containing phosphonic acid
as an N-substituent.Also, European Patent Publication EP-524023-A1 describes the
following compound as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.
This invention provides a benzopyran derivative which promotes
osteogenesis, a method of production thereof and an osteogenesis promoter
comprising it as an active ingredient.The present inventors investigated the development of a more
commonly applicable drug which acts directly on bone to promote
osteogenesis, and found that a 4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxamide
derivative activates the osteoblast function directly involved in osteogenesis
promotion, to promote bone calcification. The inventors made further
investigations based on this finding, and developed the present invention.Accordingly, the present invention relates to:
