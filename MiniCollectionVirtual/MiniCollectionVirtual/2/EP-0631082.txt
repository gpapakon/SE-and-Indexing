<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection between two pipes (11, 12) which are plugged one into the other for the purpose of the connection, the plug-in depth of one pipe into the other pipe being delimited by a stop (16, 20) arranged on the plugged-in pipe (11). In the case of said connection, the stop (16, 20) is produced, at least from partial plastic shaping on the outer circumference of the pipe wall, by exclusive displacement of the deformed wall material towards the outer circumference of the pipe wall (18).

<CLAIMS>
Connection (10) between two pipes (11, 12), which for the purpose of their
connection are plugged into one another and connected together, wherein the plug-in

depth of one pipe (11) into the other is limited by an abutment (16, 20) which is arranged
at the plugged-in pipe (11) and which is produced at least from a partial plastic shaping,

which maintains the original throughflow cross-section of the pipe (11), at the outer
circumference of the pipe wall of the plugged-in pipe (11) by an exclusive material

displacement of the deformed wall material towards the outer circumference of the pipe
wall (18).
Connection between two pipes according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the
plugged-in pipe (11) is supported in the regions of its deformation locations, which serve

for generation of the abutment (16, 20), by support means substantially maintaining the
cross-sectional shape and the cross-sectional area of the inner diameter of the plugged-in

pipe (11).
Connection between two pipes according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby
that the plastic shaping forming the abutment (16) is formed by partial crushing of the outer

circumference of the pipe wall (18).
Connection between two pipes according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby
that the plastic shaping forming the abutment (16) is formed by cutting shaping of the outer

circumference of the pipe wall (18).
Connection according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that two
abutments (16, 20), which are produced by plastic shaping and which include an angle of

180Â° therebetween, are provided.
