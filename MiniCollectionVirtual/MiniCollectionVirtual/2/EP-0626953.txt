 NOVEL SIDECHAIN-BEARING TAXANES AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOFCross Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of our copending application 07/995,443 filed December 23, 1992 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods for the preparation of sidechain-bearing taxanes and intermediates thereof, and to the novel compounds prepared by these methods.Background of the InventionTaxanes are diterpene compounds which find utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example, taxol, a taxane having the structure:where Ph is phenyl, Ac is acetyl and Bz is benzoyl, has been found to be an effective anticancer agent. Naturally occurring taxanes such as taxol may be found in plant materials, and have been isolated therefrom. Such taxanes may, however, be present in plant materials in relatively small amounts so that, in the case of taxol, for example, large numbers of the slow-growing yew trees forming a source for the compound may be required. The art has thus continued to search for synthetic, including 

semi-synthetic routes for the preparation of taxanes such as taxol and analogs thereof, as well as routes for the preparation of intermediates used in the preparation of these compounds.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a novel, overall method for the preparation of novel sidechain-bearing taxanes, comprising the following steps (a) through (e):(a) preparing an oxazoline compound of the following formulaI or a salt thereof:whereR1 is R5, R7-0-, R7-S-, or (R5)(R6)N-; R2 is R7-0-, R7-S-, or (R5)(R6)N-; R3 and R4 are independently R5, R5-0-C(0)-, or (R5)(R6)N-C(0)-; R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, or heterocyclo; and R7 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or heterocyclo; (b) converting the oxazoline of formula I or salt thereof to an oxazoline of the formula II or a salt thereof: 
where R1, R3 and R4 are as defined above;(c) coupling the oxazoline of the formula II or salt thereof with a taxane having a hydroxyl group directly bonded to C-13 thereof, or salt thereof, to form an oxazoline sidechain-bearing taxane of the following formula III or a salt thereof:where R1, R3 and R4 are as defined above, and T is a taxane moiety preferably a compound of Formula IX bonded directly through C-13 of said moiety;(d) contacting the oxazoline sidechain-bearing taxane of the formula III or salt thereof with an aqueous acid
