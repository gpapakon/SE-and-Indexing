<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to aminoquinoline derivatives of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
     in which the symbols R
<
1
>
 to R
<
6
>
 are hydrogen or one or two thereof are alkyl and the others are hydrogen, R
<
7
>
 and R
<
8
>
 are alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or, together with N, pyrrolidine or piperidine, also substituted by alkyl, octahydroindole or 3-azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane and n = 0 or 1 or in which the symbols R
<
1
>
 and R
<
3
>
 are tri- or tetramethylene, all the other substituents up to R
<
6
>
 are hydrogen, n = 0 and R
<
7
>
 and R
<
8
>
 have the above meanings, or in which the symbols R
<
1
>
 and R
<
7
>
 are methylene or dimethylene and n = 1,   R
<
1
>
 and R
<
7
>
 are di- or trimethylene and n = 0,   R
<
3
>
 and R
<
7
>
 are di- or trimethylene and n = 1,   R
<
3
>
 and R
<
7
>
 are tri- or tetramethylene and n = 0,   R
<
5
>
 and R
<
7
>
 are tri- or tetramethylene and n = 1, R
<
1
>
 and R
<
5
>
 are di- or trimethylene and n = 1, all the other substituents are hydrogen apart from R
<
8
>
, which is alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl, or in which the symbols R
<
3
>
 and R
<
5
>
 are tri- or tetramethylene and n = 1, all the other substituents up to R
<
6
>
 are hydrogen and R
<
7
>
 and R
<
8
>
 are alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl or, together with N, pyrrolidine or piperidine, also substituted by alkyl, R
<
9
>
 is hydrogen or halogen and R
<
10
>
 is halogen or trifluoromethyl, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of the general formula I for producing pharmaceuticals for controlling both chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive malaria pathogens.
