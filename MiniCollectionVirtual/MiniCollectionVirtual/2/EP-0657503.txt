<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic polyester
resins having high crystallization rate, of interest
especially in molding processes. In particular, the invention
relates to the utilization of additives for polyester
resins determining an increase in the crystallization rate
and in the crystallization temperature of the melted resin
and, in the case of the manufacture of molded articles, allows
to adopt lower mold temperatures and shorter molding
times.As known, the thermoplastic polyesters, for instance
the polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) have a broad utilization
in the manufacture of fibers, films and blown articles (bottles
for the food and drink industry by means of the so
called stretch blow moulding), having good mechanical, thermal
and electric properties and at the same time relatively
low costs. On the other hand, the thermoplastic polyesters
run into problems when used in the field of molding materials,
especially owing to the low crystallization rate,
which involves long molding cycles and high temperatures of 
the molds and therefore remarkable industrial, as well as
economic, drawbacks. Moreover a possible crystallization
completion in a subsequent time leads to a deterioration of
the molded manufactured article (dimensional changes, surface
ruffles). In the PET case in order to obtain a good formation
of the crystalline phase, and therefore molded articles
with a good surface and dimensionally stable, one must
generally operate with the mold at a temperature of at least
130-140°C.According to the art, in order to overcome these difficulties,
it has been resorted to the utilization of additives
which by acting as nucleants, speed up the crystallization
process. Most of the described additives are polar compounds,
such as alkaline or alkaline-earth organic salts.For instance in EP 102768 it is described the use of
strongly polar and hydrophilic alkaline salts of ethyleneterephthalate
oligomers as nucleant agents in the polyethyleneterephthalate
crystallization. Similarly, in US 3761450 it
is described the utilization of lithium and sodium salts of
organic polyacids in very fine particles instead of the
already known mineral nucleants. In JP 46029977 it is described
the use of sodium benzoate in the polyethyleneterephthalate
molding in order to obtain a manufactured 
article with even crystallization. In the Polymer Bulletin of April 1992 (vol. 28, no. 2, pages
151-157) it is disclosed the synthesis of polyesters-perfluoropolyethers
block copolymers using various perfluoropolyethers
