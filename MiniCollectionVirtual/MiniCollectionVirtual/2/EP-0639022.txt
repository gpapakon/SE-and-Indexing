<ABSTRACT>
Printing apparatus including a print head (1), characterised in that it comprises a buffer memory (7), configured so as to be filled, at a defined speed, by data representing the lines to be printed on a printing medium (11) and to be emptied, line by line, for each line printing by the head, and calculating means (6), configured to determine, prior to the printing of each line, the volume of buffer memory (7) remaining available (L-xi), to determine therefrom a speed (Xj) of printing the line in question and drive the means (3) for setting the printing speed (Xj) of the head (1) as a consequence. -Application to fax machines.

Printing device comprising a print head (1) which comprises a buffer memory (7), arranged
to be filled, at a specific rate, by data, representative of lines to be printed on a print medium

(11), and to be emptied line by line each time a line is printed by the head, and calculating
means (6) arranged to determine, prior to the printing of each line, the volume of buffer

memory (7) remaining available (L - xi), characterised in that the calculating means (6)
consequently determine a printing speed (Xj) for the line concerned and consequently control

means (3) for controlling the printing speed (Xj) of the head (1).
Printing device according to claim 1, wherein the calculating means (6) are arranged to
write to the memory (7), in the form of at least one code word, the data representative of a

line.
Printing device according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein the data to be printed are the
data of a page and the calculating means (6) are arranged to determine the position of the line

to be printed on the page and to determine the corresponding printing speed (Xj) depending
on this position.
Printing device according to one of claims 2 and 3, wherein the calculating means (6) are
arranged to control line feed means (10) of means for feeding the print medium (11).
Printing device according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the print head (1) is a thermal
head and the means for controlling the printing speed comprise means (6, 20) for controlling

the activation of the head (1).
