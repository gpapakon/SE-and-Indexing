Process for determining the position and/or 
checking the separation and/or checking the coplanarity 

of the leads (A) of components (B), in which process in 
each case one direct shadow of the region of the leads at 

one side of the component is generated successively by 
illumination from two different directions on the photosensitive 

surface of a spatially resolving optoelectronic 
transducer (W2; W3; W4) and the spatial position of the 

leads (A) is computed from the differing position of 
corresponding shadow edges of the leads (A) on the 

optoelectronic transducer (W2; W3; W4). 
Process for determining the position and/or 
checking the separation and/or checking the coplanarity 

of the leads (A) of components (B), which are removed 
from a predetermined removal position of a component 

preparation device by means of a planting head (BK2; BK3; 
BK4) and are positioned in a predetermined position on a 

printed circuit board (LP) or a ceramic substrate, 
characterized in that in each case one direct shadow of 

the region of the leads at one side of the component is 
generated successively by illumination from two different 

directions on the photosensitive surface of a spatially 
resolving optoelectronic transducer (W2; W3; W4) fitted 

to the planting head (BK2; BK3; BK4), and in that the 
spatial position of the leads (A) is computed from the 

differing position of corresponding shadow edges of the 
leads (A) on the optoelectronic transducer (W2; W3; W4). 
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that a photodiode (FD) which is
