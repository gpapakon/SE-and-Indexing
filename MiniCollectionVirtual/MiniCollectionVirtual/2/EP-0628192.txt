Gaming machine system, including 

a number of interlinked gaming machines having a 
reading means for reading user cards and 
a computer-controlled money processing arrangement 
(2), which is linked with the gaming machines (30, 32, 

34, 36, 38, 60, 62, 64) and provided with a paying-in 
unit (6, 16) and a paying-out unit (14, 20), which 

arrangement 
stores the credit of the user and releases a gaming 
machine after a user card has been read if there is 

sufficient corresponding credit, whereby it updates the 
credit according to the data of the games transmitted by 

the gaming machine, 
contains a stock of user cards and a card dispenser, 
has a store for user credit, and 
has a collecting unit for an amount which is input via 
the paying-in unit, whereby an input amount is stored in 

the store for user credit, and a user card having a code 
corresponding to the stored user credit is issued via 

the card dispenser, 
 
characterised in that 


the gaming machines each have an indicator which, when 
a user card is in its reading means, indicates the 

credit associated with such card and stored in the money 
processing arrangement, whereby the representation of 

the credit is possibly effected incrementally, 
a plurality of gaming machines can be simultaneously 
played with one user card, whereby the sum of wins and 

credits in each gaming machine is fed back to the money 
processing arrangement on a command of the player to 

terminate the game, 
the money processing arrangement (2) has a means for 
cancelling user codes and the associated credits at  

 
prescribed times, 
the money processing arrangement is accommodated in a 
separate, safe-like central housing (4), and 
the money processing arrangement (2) includes an alarm 
system with a means for automatically switching-off the 

machines, an error indicating arrangement with a means 
for automatically switching-off the machines, a personal 

control means, a price-adjusting means and possibly 
additional control means. 
Gaming machine system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the money processing arrangement 

has a paying-in unit (6, 16) and a paying-out unit (14, 
20) for coins and/or banknotes, whereby the input money 

is suppliable to individual paying-out containers for 
specific cash values of the paying-out unit (14, 20) via 

sorting means. 
Gaming machine system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the money processing arrangement 

(2) can be used as a money changer. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the credit of the player 

in the money processing arrangement (2) is credited to 
the selected gaming machine via the user card reading 

means of the selected gaming machine of the interlinked 
gaming machines, and the game is played on the basis of 

this credit. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 

1 to 4, characterised in that a plurality of gaming 
machines can be played simultaneously with one user 

card, whereby the sum of wins and credits in each gaming  
 

machine is fed back to the money processing arrangement 
after a re-insertion of the user card and after a key 

has been actuated to terminate the game. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) has a card reading means (4), whereby a 
code, which has been read, of a user card in the card 

reading means is compared with the user code relating 
to existing credits in the store for user credits and, 

if an associated credit exists, and if an amount is fed 
into the paying-in unit, this amount is added to the 

stored credit amount. 
Gaming machine system according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the money processing arrangement 

(2) has an indicator (18) which, when a user card is in 
the card reading means, indicates the stored credit 

associated with said card. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that the user card is a 

magnetic card. 
Gaming machine system according to claim 8, 
characterised in that, when the magnetic card is 

inserted, the credit and the win are jointly carried in 
the money processing arrangement (2) via the code of the 

magnetic card. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 9, characterised in that the user card is a chip 

card having a non-volatile memory chip.  
 
Gaming machine system according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the chip card is value-coded. 
Gaming machine system according to claims 10 and 
11, characterised in that, when a chip card is 

introduced, the credit on the chip card and the win are 
jointly carried in the money processing arrangement (2) 

via the code of the chip card. 
Gaming machine system according to claims 10 to 
12, characterised in that the chip cards are dispensable 

in graded denominations by the money processing 
arrangement (2). 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 13, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) includes a testing means, via which the 
gaming machine data, such as statistics, turnover, 

special games, series of special games and the like, are 
collected cyclically. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 14, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) has a data collecting means for 
determining regular players who receive a bonus via the 

user card. 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 15, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) either has an interface for 
communication with a computer (22) or has an internal 

computer.  
 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 16, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) has associated therewith an internal 
computer with an external operator control panel, 

whereby the operator control panel can communicate with 
the computer via an interface of the money processing 

arrangement (2). 
Gaming machine system according to one of claims 
1 to 17, characterised in that the money processing 

arrangement (2) has an interface for the remote 
transmission of data to a personal computer for home 

use via a modem.
