<ABSTRACT>
A device for enriching water with CO2 gas in order to generate carbonated water has a reservoir, i.e. a so-called carbonator, which is provided with cooling pipes of a cooling circuit for cooling its content and for forming an ice envelope (11) in the area of its walls, and contains a circulating pump (9) which is switched on and off in continuous cycles controlled by a timing circuit (14).

<CLAIMS>
Device for enriching water with CO₂ gas for the production of 
carbonated water in a storage container (1), which for cooling of 

its content and for formation of an ice jacket (11) in the wall region 
is provided with cooling ducts (10) of a cooling circuit and in the 

interior of which is arranged a circulating pump (5) by which CO₂ 
gas from the head region (6) of the storage container is mixed in 

the water and/or the water within the storage container is set into 
rotation and/or circulation, and in which both water and CO₂ gas are 

fed into the head region and from which carbonated water is withdrawable 
in the base region, characterised thereby that a time control 

circuit is provided and the circulating pump can be put into and out 
of operation controlled by the time control circuit in continuous 

cycles. 
Use of the device according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the circulating pump is put into and out of operation controlled 

by the time control circuit in continuous cycles. 
Use according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the switch-on 
duration of the circulating pump amounts to 1 to 2 minutes and 

the ratio of switch-on duration to the switch-off duration is about 
1:10 to 1:20. 
Use according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterised thereby that 
on removal of carbonated water from the storage container or on 

subsequent charging of fresh water into the storage container the 
circulating pump is put into operation during this phase inclusive 

of a follow-on phase. 
Use according to claim 5, characterised thereby that this follow-on 
phase amounts to about 2 to 4 minutes.
