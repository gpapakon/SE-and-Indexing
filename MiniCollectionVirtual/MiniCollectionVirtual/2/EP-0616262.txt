<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to coated recording sheets. More specifically, the
present invention is directed to recording sheets particularly suitable for use in
electrophotographic printing processes.US-A-5,118,570 (Malhotra) and U.S. Patent 5,006,407 (Malhotra),
disclose a transparency which
comprises a hydrophilic coating and a plasticizer, which plasticizer can, for example, be from
the group consisting of phosphates, substituted phthalic anhydrides, glycerols, glycols,
substituted glycerols, pyrrolidinones, alkylene carbonates, sulfolanes, and stearic acid
derivatives.DE-A-2,411,219 describes a recording sheet comprising a substrate and thereon a
coating containing a binder, a pigment and a fatty acid. WO-A-9304870 describes ink jet
recording sheets containing ink-receptive layers that can be imaged by the application of liquid
ink dots.US-A-5 108 980 refers to a recording material
including a coating which comprises a binder and as a further additive higher fatty acid
esters, higher alcohols and higher amines. While the above materials and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a
need remains for recording sheets particularly suitable for use in electrophotographic
applications. In addition, a need remains for recording sheets upon which the toner materials
commonly employed in electrophotographic imaging processes exhibit improved adhesion.
Further, there is a need for recording sheets exhibiting improved toner adhesion wherein the
additive components in the coating on the recording sheet which enable the improved
adhesion remain within the coating when the recording sheet is stored in a vinyl or plastic
folder.It is an object of the present invention to provide a recording sheet with the above
advantages.These and other objects of the present invention (or specific embodiments thereof)
can be achieved by providing a recording sheet in accordance with the appended claims.The present invention provides also a process for generating
images and an imaging process in accordance with the
appended claims. The recording sheets of the present invention comprise a substrate or base sheet
having a coating on one or both surfaces thereof. Any suitable substrate can be employed.
Examples of substantially transparent substrate materials include polyesters, including Mylar™,
available from E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company, Melinex™, available from Imperial
Chemicals, Inc., Celanar™, available from Celanese Corporation, polycarbonates such as
Lexan™, available from General Electric Company,
