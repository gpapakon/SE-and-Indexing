<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to "front-end" communication 
techniques between process control computers and a plant/local area network. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to an intelligent front-end communication system 
and method which is capable of handling a plurality of actively redundant process control 
computers. In chemical manufacturing plants and other relatively large processing plants, a 
network of control computers and operator workstations may be needed to achieve 
automated control of an ongoing physical process in the plant. For example, the Jones et. al 
U.S. Patent No. 4,663,704, issued on May 5,1987, shows a distributed processing system for a 
plant in which a single data highway connects all the various input/output terminals, data 
acquisition stations, control devices, record keeping devices and so forth. Similarly, the Henzel 
U.S. Patent No. 4,607,256, issued on August 19, 1986, shows a plant management system which 
utilizes a plant control bus for the purpose of transmitting data to physical computer modules 
on the network. In some of these process control computer networks, redundant process control 
computers are employed to enhance the reliability of the plant control and monitoring system. 
For example, the Fiebig et. al U.S. Patent No. 5,008,805, issued on April 16, 1991, shows a 
networked control system which includes a " hot standby" redundant processor that 
synchronously processes a control schedule table for comparison with control messages from a 
sender processor that are transmitted on the network. The redundant listener processor 
maintains a duplicate configuration in its memory ready to take over control of the system in 
the event of a failure of the sender processor. As another example, the McLaughlin et. al U.S. 
Patent No. 4,958,270, issued on September 18, 1990, shows a networked control system which 
employs a primary controller and a secondary controller. In order to maintain consistency 
between the primary data base and a secondary image of the data base, only predetermined 
areas changed are updated as a way of increasing the efficiency of the update function. 
Similarly, the Slater U.S. Patent No. 4,872,106, issued on October 3, 1989, shows a networked 
control system which employs a primary data processor and a back- up data processor. 
Normally, the back-up processor will be in a back-up mode of operation, and it will not operate 
to exercise control over the input/output devices or receive data concerning the states
