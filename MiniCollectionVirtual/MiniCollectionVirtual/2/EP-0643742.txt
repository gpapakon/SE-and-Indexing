<ABSTRACT>
Paintable, thermoplastic polymer blends are prepared from (A) at least about 50 weight percent polyethylene, for example, high density polyethylene (HDPE), grafted with at least about 0.01 weight percent of an unsaturated organic compound, for example, maleic anhydride, and (B) a thermoplastic polymer containing polar groups, for example, a polyurethane or a polyester. Optionally, the grafted polyethylene of (A) can be diluted with an ungrated polyethylene, for example, ungrafted HDPE. These blends can be molded into various structural components, for example, automobile parts, and can be painted without the use of either a primer or a preliminary surface treatment, for example, chemical etching. The polyethylene blends also demonstrate excellent adhesion to various rigid polyurethane foams.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PAINTABLE POLYETHYLENESThis invention relates to functionalized polyethylenes. In one aspect, the invention relates to polyethylenes grafted with an unsaturated organic compound containing at least one double bond and at least one functional acid group, for example, maleic anhydride, while in another aspect, the invention relates to the high compatibility of these functionalized polyethylenes with various thermoplastic polymers containing a polar group. In one embodiment, the invention relates to articles molded from blends of functionalized polyethylenes and such polymers that can be painted without a surface pretreatment or a special primer while in another embodiment, the invention relates to laminates of functionalized polyethylenes and certain polyurethane foams that demonstrate near perfect adhesion to one another.Because of their light weight, durability, low cost and other desirable properties, thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO's) have steadily grown in use as a material of construction for a large array of consumer goods. For example, the automotive industry uses these materials in a variety of interior and exterior parts, while household appliance manufacturers employ TPO's in everything from support structures to decorative facia.While TPO's have many desirable properties, they also have certain undesirable properties not the least of which is their reluctance to accept a paint or decorative print. TPO's are, by definition, hydrocarbon polymers, typically a polyethylene, polypropylene or an ethylene-propylene rubber, and as such, are nonpolar. Most paints are polar, and thus require a surface with some degree of polarity before they can adhere to it with any degree of desirable fastness. This problem has been addressed, with varying degrees of success, in a number of different ways.One relatively common solution is to apply a primer to the TPO.Primers are, typically compositions containing a halogenated polyolefin and an aromatic solvent, for example, a chlorinated polypropylene and toluene. hile primers are generally recognized as effective, they are expensive 

and their application is an extra step in the finishing of the TPO article.Another method of enhancing the paintability of a TPO surface is to subject the surface to a physical or chemical etching, or irradiating the surface with a plasma. While generally effective, these methods are more complex in nature than the application of a primer, and thus more difficult to control in terms of quality and consistency from part to part. In
