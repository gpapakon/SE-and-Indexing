<ABSTRACT>
A tamperproof closure (1) for bottles and the 
like, affording unfailing performance on the occasions 

of first unsealing and subsequent open/close cycles, 
and having a construction which facilitates its 

assembly into a whole adapted to be handled as a unit, 
and once assembled, its installation onto the bottle, 

comprises a pouring body (10) provided with a flange 
(12), a tubular body (17) provided with an annular 

inner ledge (19), a screw cap (26) attached to the 
tubular body (17) through a line of weakness (33), and 

a face coupling (35) between the ledge (19) on the 
tubular body (17) and the flange (12) on the pouring 

body (10) for making the pouring body (10) angularly 
rigid with the tubular body (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tamperproof 
closure for bottles and the like, according to the 
preamble of Claim 1 (see US-A-4 458 817). Closures of the above type, while performing 
satisfactorily from several aspects and being widely 
used, still may develop some problems on first 
unsealing, as well as on the occasion of subsequent 
open/close cycles, when their parts associated together 
along the axial direction to make up the closure happen 
to have axial dimensions which lie close to extreme 
values of their respective tolerance ranges. In 
particular, the screw cap may not screw off the pouring 
body in a proper fashion because the latter fails to be 
held to the bottle with adequate firmness. The underlying object of this invention is 
to provide a closure as indicated which has such a 
construction and performance features as to overcome  
 
the above-mentioned drawback. This object is achieved by a closure 
according to Claim 1. Further features and the advantages of a 
closure according to this invention will be apparent 
from the following description of a preferred 
embodiment thereof, given by way of illustration and 
not of limitation with reference to the accompanying 
drawing figures, of which: 
Figure 1 shows a part-sectional exploded view 
of a closure according to the invention; Figure 2 shows a detail of the closure in 
Figure 1, drawn to an enlarged scale;  Figure 3 shows another detail of the closure 
in Figure 1, also drawn to an enlarged scale; and  Figure 4 shows a general view, partly in 
section, of the closure in Figure 1 as applied to a 
bottle.   With reference to the drawing figures, 
generally shown at 1 is a tamperproof closure intended 
for use on a bottle 2 or the like, and having an axis 
X-X. The bottle 2 includes a mouth opening 3 
having a free edge 4 and being formed with a groove 5  
 
on its exterior, which groove defines an axial shoulder 
6, and with a plurality of elevations 7 and depressions 
8 jointly defining a grooved contour 9. The closure 1 comprises a pouring body, 
generally indicated at 10, which has a free edge 11 and 
an outer annular flange 12. The pouring body 10, being 
preferably a polystyrene molding, is completed by a 
washer 13, made preferably of polyethylene, and 
encloses a one-way shutter 14, also made preferably of 
polyethylene, which functions to prevent unauthorized 
topping up of the bottle. A multi-start outer threadway 15 is formed on 
the exterior of the pouring body 10 which has threads 
as indicated at 16, in this example two

<CLAIMS>
A tamperproof closure (1) for bottles (2) and 
the like, comprising: a pouring 

body (10) having a free edge (11), an outside threadway 
(15), and an annular outer flange (12); a tubular body 

(17) having an annular ledge (19) on its interior, 
elevations (22) and depressions (23) defining a grooved 

contour (24), and an annular folding tab (21); a screw 
cap (26) having an inside threadway (30) mating with 

the outside threadway (15) on the pouring body (10), 
said screw cap (26) being attached to the tabular body 

(17) through a line of weakness (33); and a coupling means 
(35) between the tubular body (17) and the pouring body 

(10); characterized in that the coupling means (35) comprise 
teeth (36) projecting from the ledge (19) and teeth 

(37) projecting from the flange (12). 
A closure (1) according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that said teeth (36, 37) are front teeth. 
A closure (1) according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the front teeth (36) projecting from the ledge 

(19) are provided in a large number, preferably forty 
in number, and that the front teeth (37) projecting 

from the flange (12) are at least two in number located 
diametrically opposite  

 
from each other. 
A closure (1) according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the teeth (36,37) have an 

isosceles triangular configuration with rounded apex. 
A closure according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the outside threadway (15) on the 

pouring body (10) and the inside threadway (29) on the 
cap (26) have sawtooth profile threads (16,30). 
A closure (1) according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the outside threadway (15) and 

the inside threadway (29) are multi-start threadways, 
and that the inside threadway (29) has a larger number 

of threads than the outside threadway (15), preferably 
twice as many. 
A closure (1) according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that it comprises elastic means (31) 

interposed between the cap (26) and the pouring body 
(10). 
A closure (1) according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that said elastic means (31) are small 

wings (32) projecting from the cap (26) and formed 
integrally with the cap (26). 
A closure (1) according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the elevations (22) of the 

grooved contour (24) on the tubular body (17) comprise  
 

axial extensions (25) having a width dimension of 
predetermined limited value and rounded ends of 

predetermined length to start engaging in depressions 
(8) of a grooved contour (9) formed on the bottle (2), 

while upon fitting the closure (1) axially onto the 
bottle (2), the tab (21) is yet to engage the bottle
