<ABSTRACT>
A low pressure aerosol dispensing can (10) which is distinguished from existing high pressure aerosol dispensing cans. The generally cylindrical can has a thin wall thickness, like that of a carbonated beverage, can which can be distorted by finger pressure but whose shape is maintained by internal gas pressure. The liquid contents (28) to be dispensed and the propellant gas are mixed in the can. The dispensing valve (40) at the top of the can dispenses the liquid contents and propellant in a narrow bore vapor tap (90) between the gaseous propellant head space (32) in the can the valve chamber (64) for delivering extra gas for atomizing the liquid and propelling it from the nozzle (10). The gas pressure in the can is coordinated with the can wall and bottom thickness so that the can will have sufficient distortion resistance and burst resistance at elevated temperature. Yet the can has side walls of a thickness low enough to permit the can to be easily crushed by hand pressure when the can is empty.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aerosol dispensing
can according to the preamble of claim 1.Such cans are generally known and can be seen from US-A-4940171.
Such known cans generally have rigid walls of relative
high thickness such that the cans are not easily deformable
when in unpressurized state.The present invention aims to provide a can of the type
described which would allow a weight reduction of the can thus
lowering the material consumption and weight of waste.Thereto the can according to the invention is characterized
as given in the characterizing part of claim 1.With respect to the invention US-A-4271991 is mentioned
describing a low pressure dispensing can. Said can is a barrier
type of can unlike the inventive can and will, due to the barrier
presence, not reach an unpressurized state upon normal use.The invention also relates to a process for forming an
aerosol spray-can filled with fluent material to be dispensed
as given in the preamble of claim 15.The process as described is according to the invention
characterized in the features as given in the characterizing
part of claim 15. Many fluent materials and particularly liquid
materials are dispensed from pressurized aerosol spray
cans of the non-barrier type, wherein there is no
separation between the fluent material to be dispensed
and the can pressurizing propellent. The present
invention is primarily directed to a non-barrier can. A
barrier can has a moveable barrier in it, such as a
piston or an enlarged or flexible diaphragm, where the
material to be dispensed is at the side of the barrier
toward the outlet from the can and the propellant is on
the other side of the barrier and pushes against the
barrier and pushes the fluent material through the can
outlet. The propellant typically is not expelled along
with the product. Barrier cans are primarily designed
for handling viscous products, because a non-barrier can
will not be able to dispense these products.The aerosol spray can of the invention has a
spray forming and dispensing valve on it with a small
flow orifice which communicates between the interior of
the can and a small swirl chamber in the spray dispensing
button. The mixed fluent material and propellant enter
the swirl chamber in the spray button and from there exit
the spray button through a spray outlet. When the valve 
is opened, the elevated pressure in the can forces a
mixture of the propellant and the fluent material through
the valve orifice into the swirl chamber. The rapid drop
