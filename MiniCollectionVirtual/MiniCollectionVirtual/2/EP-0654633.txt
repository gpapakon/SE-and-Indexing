<ABSTRACT>
The invention deals with a reservoir, particularly a gas bottle (cylinder) comprising, in its lower part (2), a base (3) allowing it to stand in a stable position on the ground. This reservoir is characterised in that, in the region of this base (3), it includes retractable running means (7) which, in an extended position A, make it easier to shift the said reservoir (1) and, in the retracted position B, allow the latter again to rest on the ground in a stable manner via the said base (3). The present invention relates to reservoirs generally, and quite particularly, gas bottles.

Container (1), in particular a gas bottle, comprising, in its lower portion
(2), a base (3) allowing to maintain same in a stable position on the floor,

characterized in that it includes, at the level of this base (3), withdrawable rolling
means (7) which, in the protruding position A, facilitate the change of location

of said container (1) and, in the withdrawn position B, allow this latter
again to stably rest on the floor by means of said base (3).
Container according to claim 1, characterized in that the withdrawable
rolling means (7) are in the shape of at least one castor (8, 9; 8A, 9A) rotationally

mounted onto the end (10) of a bracket (11; 11A) which is, in turn, pivotingly
mounted, at its opposite end (12), onto the lower portion (2) of the container

(1), so that, in the withdrawn position B, the castors (8, 9; 8A, 9A) withdraw
into the base (3) of the container and, in the protruding position A, said

castors (8, 9; 8A, 9A) are located below the level (15) of the base (3).
Container according to claim 2, characterized in that the axis of rotation
of the castors (8, 9; 8A, 9A) is parallel to the horizontal axis (13) about

which pivots the bracket (11) to reach the protruding position A or the withdrawn
position B.
Container according to claim 3, characterized in that the withdrawable
rolling means (7) include at least a pair of castors (8, 9) the brackets (11) of

which are made integral through a cross-bar (16) authorizing a simultaneous
pivoting of said brackets (11) about one and the same horizontal axis of rotation

(13).
Container according to claim 2, characterized in that the axis of rotation
of a castor (8A, 9A) is perpendicular to the horizontal axis of rotation

(13A) about which pivots its bracket (11A) with respect to the lower portion (2)
of the container (1).
Container according to claim 5, characterized in that the withdrawable
rolling means (7) include at least two castors (8A, 9A) arranged diametrically

opposite to each other at the level of the lower portion (2) of the container (1)
and capable of swinging back, through the pivotment of their bracket (11A)

about the horizontal axis of rotation (13A), in the direction of the central portion
(24) of said container (1).
Container according to any of claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the
base (3) is defined by an annular rim including cut-outs (17, 18) and complementary 

recesses (20, 21) capable of accomodating the castors (8, 9) and their respective
brackets (11) in the withdrawn position B.
Container according to any of claims 5 and 6, characterized in that the
base (3) is defined by an annular rim (4) including cut-outs (17, 18) allowing to

accomodate the hinging means (32) connecting the brackets (11A) to said container
(1), this annular rim (4) defining, under the container (1), a recess inside

which the castors (8A, 9A) and their brackets (11) position themselves in
the withdrawn position B.
Container according to any of claims 2 to 8, characterized in that it includes
stopping means (14) limiting the rotation of the brackets (11; 11A) with

respect to their horizontal axis of rotation (13; 13A) when controlling the protrusion
of the castors (8, 9; 8A, 9A), in order to immobilize same when they

are located below the level (15) of the base (3).
Container according to any of claims 2 to 9, characterized in that it includes
locking means of an unlockable kind in order to lock the castors (8, 9;

8A, 9A) in their withdrawn position B and/or in their protruding position A.
Container according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that it includes remote-control means (27) to ensure the control in protrusion

and in withdrawal of the withdrawable rolling means (7).
Container according to claim 11, characterized in that the remote-control

means (27) include a control organ (28), such as a lever (31), mounted,
through hinging means (32), onto the container (1), this control organ (28) being

capable of acting on transmission means (30), such as a cable or a chain
(36), through driving means (33), such as a pulley or a toothed wheel (34), said

transmission means (30) co-operating with the withdrawable rolling means
(7) to bring same, according to the direction of the action on the control organ

(28), into the protruding position A or into the withdrawn position B.
Container according to claim 12, characterized in that, at the level of
the lower portion (2) of the container (1), the transmission means (30), such as

a cable or a chain (36), are divided into as many strands (37, 37A) as there are
independent castors (8A, 9A) or pairs of castors (8, 9), these strands being made

integral with a pulley or a toothed wheel (39, 39A) arranged on the axis of rotation
(13, 13A) of a bracket (11, 11A) and made rotationally integral with this

latter.
Container according to claim 11, characterized in that it includes 
means for locking the control organ (28) in its position corresponding to the

protrusion and/or the withdrawal of the castors (8, 9; 8A, 9A).
Container according to claim 14, characterized in that the means for
locking the control organ (28) in addition form the means for locking the castors

(8, 9; 8A, 9A) in their protruding position A and/or in their withdrawn
position B.
Container according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that it includes gripping means with a lever arm (47) of a withdrawable kind.
Container according to claims 12 and 16, characterized in that the
gripping means with a lever arm (47) are substantially formed by the control

organ (28) of the remote-control means (27).
