Pneumatic brake-booster comprising a casing (10) 
inside which is a piston (20) formed of a back tubular 

part (22) supporting a skirt (14) and which, with the aid 
of an unrolling membrane (12), defines a front chamber 

(16) connected permanently to a source of partial vacuum 
and a back chamber (18) connected selectively to the 

front chamber (16) or to the atmosphere via a valve means 
(40) actuated by a control rod (34) capable of bearing, 

through the intermediary of the front face of a plunger 
(32), against a first face of a reaction disk (58) 

securely attached through a second face to a thrust rod 
(56), the piston (20) bearing against the reaction disk 

(58) through a resilient annular front face (68, 68'), 
deformable between a rest position and an active position, 

the annular front face (68, 68') of the piston (20) 
being placed in its active position when the thrust rod 

(56) exerts on the reaction disk (58) a force greater 
than a pre-determined value, characterized in that the 

annular front face (68, 68') of the piston (20) is 
constituted by an annular resilient washer (68, 68') 

bearing through its outer peripheral edge against a step 
(66) of the piston (20) and against the reaction disk 

(58), and in that an intermediate resilient member (74, 
74') is disposed between the annular front face (68, 68') 

of the piston 20 and the plunger (32). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the intermediate resilient member (74, 74') is in 

contact with the plunger (32) and the annular front face 
(68, 68') of the piston (20) when the latter is in its 

active position. 
Booster according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the intermediate resilient member (74, 74') is 

constituted by a second annular resilient washer (74, 
74'). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the diameter of the inner peripheral edge of the  

 
annular resilient washer (68, 68') is slightly greater 

than that of the front face of the plunger (58), and in 
that the diameter of the outer peripheral edge of the 

annular resilient washer (68, 68') is equal to that of 
the reaction disk (58). 
Booster according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the annular resilient washer (68') comprises a 

peripheral ring (84) and at least two sectors (86) 
extending radially inwards and truncated circularly at 

their tips. 
Booster according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the annular resilient washer (68') is locked in 

rotation to the piston (20). 
Booster according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the second annular resilient washer (74') comprises 

a peripheral ring (90) and at least two sectors (92) 
extending radially inwards and truncated circularly at 

their tips. 
Booster according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the second resilient washer (74') is locked in 

rotation to the plunger (32). 
Booster according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the plunger (32) is locked in rotation to the 

control rod (34). 
Booster according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that at least one cut-out (94) is made in each sector 

(92) of the second annular resilient washer (74'). 
Booster according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the piston (20) is formed with a 

stepped bore (60), of which a front part (62) of greater 
diameter, receives the reaction disk (58) and the annular 

resilient washer (68, 68'), and of which a back part (64) 
of diameter smaller than that of the front part (62) 

receives the intermediate resilient member (74', 74' ) and 
a radial extension (70, 80) of the plunger (32) against 

which the intermediate resilient member (74, 74') comes 
into contact when the annular front face (68, 68') of the 

piston (20) is in its active position.  
 
Booster according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the radial extension (80) of the plunger (32) is 

formed on a rigid washer (80) which comes to bear against 
a step (72) of the plunger when the annular front face 

(68, 68') of the piston (20) is in its active position. 
Booster according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a rigid annular washer (106) is 

disposed on the back face of the reaction disk (58).
