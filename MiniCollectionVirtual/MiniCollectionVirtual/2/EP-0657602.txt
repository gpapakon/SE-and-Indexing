<ABSTRACT>
Centrifugal pump (1) for recirculating water, applicable to swimming pools, which comprises a prefilter (12), a delivery chamber (15) and an electric motor (4), the shaft (6) of which sets in motion an impeller wheel (vane wheel) (7) which rotates in a diffusion chamber (8). The prefilter comprises a bowl filter (bucket filter) (20) inside an external container (16) so that the liquid drawn in penetrates the external container (16) via the external intake opening and has necessarily to flow through the walls of the said bowl filter (20) before reaching the pump. The external container (16) is equipped with just one externally threaded circular opening (17) equipped at its edge with a seal (22), a tubular component (23) being arranged and designed to bear on the edge of the opening (17) and which fits into a perforated screw nut (25) designed to be able to be screwed around the external screw (19) of the external container.

Centrifugal pump (1) for recirculating water, for use in particular in swimming-pools, 
the pump being provided with an electric motor (4) of which the shaft (6) drives a bladed 

wheel (7) with a plurality of blades, the wheel rotating inside a diffusion chamber (8) 
which is closed in particular by a diffusor (9), the liquid entering coaxially to the bladed 

wheel and being expelled by centrifugal force to a delivery chamber (15) located between 
the electric motor (4) and a pre-filter (12), the pump (1) having a pump body (2) which 

is divided into two contiguous longitudinal portions, a front portion forming the pre-filter 
(12) and a rear portion in which is defined the diffusion chamber (8) which is shaped by 

the diffuser (9) and the delivery chamber (15) which occupies the remaining space, the pre-filter 
being designed such that it comprises an outer container (16) and a vertical bucket 

filter (20) placed inside the outer container (16) provided with an external induction intake, 
with a horizontal circular mouth closed in a leaktight manner, enabling the bucket filter to 

be introduced and removed, and with an outlet pipe connected to the axial inlet of the 
bladed wheel (7), such that the liquid drawn in penetrates the outer container (16) via the 

external induction intake and of necessity has to pass through the walls of the bucket filter 
(20) before arriving at the pump, characterized in that the induction intake and the 

horizontal circular mouth of the outer container (16) are combined in a single horizontal 
circular aperture (17) which is formed at the open upper end of a cylindrical upper portion 

(18) of the outer container and is threaded externally, the bucket filter (20) being vertically 
disposed and provided at its mouth with a peripheral externally projecting shoulder (21) 

designed to bear on the edge of the horizontal circular aperture (17) of the outer container, 
the edge being provided with a groove into which is introduced a leaktight seal (22), a  

 
tubular part (23) being disposed at one of the ends of a flange (24) which has substantially 

the same diameter as that of the aperture (17) of the outer container and is designed to bear 
on the edge thereof, a centrally pierced nut (25) being provided, through the opening in 

which the tubular part (23) can pass, this tubular part (23) being adapted so as to be 
screwed about the outer thread (19) of the cylindrical upper portion (18) of the outer 

container, such that, when the screw nut is tightened during the screwing process, it 
compresses the flange (24) of the tubular part against the upper edge of the aperture (17) 

of the outer container (16), so compressing the peripheral shoulder (21) of the bucket filter 
and the seal (22) between the flange (24) of the tubular part and the upper edge of the 

aperture (17) of the outer container.
