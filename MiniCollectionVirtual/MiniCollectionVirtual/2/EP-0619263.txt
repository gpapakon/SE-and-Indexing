<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a compensation 
system in an elevator comprising an elevator 

car (2), a counterweight (3), a set 
of elevator suspension ropes (11) on 

which the elevator car (2) and the counterweight 
(3) are suspended, a traction 

sheave (5) whose motion is transmitted 
via the suspension ropes (11) to the 

elevator car (2) and to the counterweight 
(3), and a set of compensating ropes (4) 

and at least one diverting pulley (15) 
belonging to the suspension rope system 

(11) and at least one buffer arrangement 
(9) for the counterweight (3). The suspension 

ratio of the compensating rope 
(4) is the same as that of the suspension 

ropes (11), or multiplied by a coefficient. 
The rope suspension ratio on the 

side of the elevator car (2) is the same 
as or different than on the side of the 

counterweight (3). For the compensation 
of the elongation of the suspension and 

compensating ropes (11 and 4) of the elevator, 
a buffer (23) below the counterweight 

(3) has a provision for vertical 
adjustment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compensation system in an
elevator according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a
system for compensating the elongation of elevator ropes.In elevators with a large hoisting height, compensating
ropes are needed to balance the moment of unstability caused
by the hoisting ropes and generated when the elevator is
moving. Without balancing, the motor would have to be considerably
bigger and the effect would become worse according
to height. If the height in the shaft increases sufficiently
without compensation, a situation will arise where the friction
is insufficient. High-rise elevators employ compensating
ropes which are tightened by means of a compensation
tension weight.In high-rise buildings, the elevators travel at a high
velocity and in malfunction situations (gripping, hitting
the buffers) both the car and the counterweight may bounce
through relatively long distances before their kinetic
energy is exhausted. The result is a strong impact on the
ropes, which may damage the elevator structures or injure
people. For this reason, the compensation tension equipment
in fast elevators is provided with a bounce eliminator. This
bounce eliminator also reduces the space needed at the top
of the shaft because less bouncing headroom is required.In high-rise buildings where the suspension ratio of the
suspension ropes for the car and counterweight is 2:1, it is
often necessary to use many compensating or balancing ropes
and a very heavy tension weight. Sometimes this need for
compensation is so great that the moment caused by the suspension
ropes cannot be fully compensated, with the consequence
that the motor size is increased.DE publication 1251926 presents a solution in which the path
of the counterweight is halved and the counterweight is 
placed in the lower part of the shaft. In FI patent 82823,
the path of the counterweight is halved and placed in the
upper part of the shaft. Unfortunately, there is currently
no compensation system for these solutions, which is why
it has been necessary to use large motors in them and also
the height has been limited because of the friction.The object of the present invention is to achieve a solution
in which the required number of compensating ropes is always
used and the moment needed by the motor is minimal. Inadequate
compensation, i.e. a situation where the moment of
the motor increases when the number of compensating ropes
used is insufficient, is no longer unavoidable in high-rise
buildings where the suspension ratio of the car

counterweight (3) is the same or multiplied by a
constant as the corresponding suspension ratio of the suspension ropes

(11), and that the suspension ratio of the suspension ropes

claim 1, 
characterized

counterweight (3) is 2:1.
Compensation arrangement in an elevator according to
claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the lowest compensation
diverting pulleys (6) are fixedly mounted in place so that

they cannot move in the vertical direction, and that the
compensating ropes (4) are tensioned by means of a separate

tension weight (8) which is placed at one end of the compensating
rope (4) and is able to move in the vertical direction

in the vertical diretion.
