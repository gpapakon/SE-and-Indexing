<ABSTRACT>
Dispensing unit comprising a container (2) and a dispensing member for dispensing a product contained in the container (2). The cylindrical container (2) includes a piston (16) consisting of a body (10) made of a rigid material with a cylindrical portion carrying a seal (17) made of resilient material. The seal is produced by duplicatemoulding the body (10) of the piston (16) of rigid material, the resilient material and the rigid material being chemically compatible in order that the seal (17) is linked to the body (10) of the piston (16), the seal (17) including a semi-toric portion (18).

Dispensing assembly comprising a container (2) 
and a dispensing member for dispensing the product 

contained in the container (2), the container (2) being 
cylindrical and including a piston (16, 26, 46) consisting 

of a body (10, 40) made of rigid material (30) having 
a cylindrical part carrying a seal (17, 27, 47) made of 

elastic material (31), characterized in that the seal 
(17, 27, 47) is obtained by overmoulding the body (10, 

40) of the piston (16, 26, 46) made of rigid material 
(30), the elastic material (31) and the rigid material 

(30) being chemically compatible in order to ensure that 
the seal (17, 27, 47) and the body (10, 40) of the piston 

(16, 26, 46) are bonded together, the seal (17, 27, 47) 
having at least one semi-toric portion (18, 48) and a 

sealing lip (19, 29). 
Dispensing assembly according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the seal (27) has at least two 

semi-toric portions (28A, 28B). 
Dispensing assembly according to either of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the seal (17, 27) is 

placed right at an intermediate portion (25) of the body 
(10) of the piston (16, 26). 
Dispensing assembly according to either of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the seal (47) is placed 

right at the edge (45) of the open end of the body (40) 
of the piston (46). 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the seal (17, 27, 47) made of 

elastic material (31) has a Shore A hardness of between 
30 and 120. 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the pair of rigid (30) and 

elastic (31) materials is a pair of thermoplastic 
materials which is chosen from the group formed by the 

pairs polypropylene-EPDM, polypropylene-polyethylene, 
polypropylene-styrenics, polypropylene-EPDM/polypropylene 

copolymer, polyamide-polyethylene, polyester-EPDM, 
polystyrene-polyethylene.  

 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the product to be dispensed 

has a viscosity of between an approximate value of 1 
poise and an approximate value of 70 poise. 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the dispensing member is a 

pump (12) having no air uptake, the bottom (5) of the 
container (2) including an orifice (4). 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the dispensing member is a 

dispensing valve, the piston (16, 26, 46) being pushed by 
a gaseous propellant under pressure, the said propellant 

being provided in the volume lying between the bottom of 
the container (2) and the piston (16, 26, 46). 
Dispensing assembly according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the bottom of the container is 

equipped with a filling system for filling with gaseous 
propellant. 
Dispensing assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the dispensing member is the 

piston (16, 26, 46) itself, which can be manually 
actuated, the dispensing assembly (1) constituting a 

syringe.
