<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of receiving in a GSM-network data for supplementary services in MSC/VLR which have been signalled via the protocol MAP between HLR and MSC/VLR. MAP contains sequences of "containers" for supplementary services, where respective "containers" always include a parameter that indicates the service to which the contents of a respective container relate, together with the data that varies from service to service. This parameter is always located in the same position internally within the "container". The method includes a function whose purpose is to analyze syntactically subscriber data received in MAP, to the extent that respective supplementary services can be identified. When the correct supplementary service has been identified with the aid of the data type SS-code, it obtains access to the contents of the container. Respective supplementary services analyze syntactically those data types that are included in the container in accordance with a structure which is known only in a respective supplementary service. Data is then stored locally for each supplementary service in MSC/VLR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to cellular
mobile radio systems based upon the so called GSM standard
(GSM - Global System for Mobile communication), and more
particularly to a method for receiving in a GSM network data
for supplementary services.A GSM network basically comprises at least one base
station system BSS including a base station controller BSC
and base station tranceivers BTS. The GSM network furthermore
includes a mobile services switching centre MSC, a home
location register HLR and a visitors location register VLR.Each subscribing mobile station MS belongs to a HLR in a
home network, wherein permanent subscriber data is stored.
When a mobile station is registered in a MSC/VLR as a new
visitor, that mobile station's HLR sends a copy of the
relevant subscriber data to MSC/VLR. The data is sent via the
CCITT #7 network from HLR to MSC/VLR. The procedures for this
are described in the protocol MAP (Mobile Application Part -
specified in ETSI GSM recommendation GSM 09.02). The data
structure in MAP is described generally in accordance with
ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation). ASN.1 and its rules are
specified in CCITT X.208/X.209.Subscriber data in MAP is found defined in a general data
type referred to as SubscriberData. This data type is of the
"constructed" type, which according to ASN.1 means that it,
in turn, contains new data types. The data type in
SubscriberData which relates to data for supplementary
services is called ProvisionedSupplementaryServices.
ProvisionedSupplementaryServices is, in turn, an SS-infolist
which, according to the data structure in MAP, means that it
is comprised of four different data types:
ForwardingInfoCallBarringInfoCUG-informationSS-dataForwardingInfo is a data type which describes call
forwarding services in a general manner. CallBarringInfo is a
data type which describes call barring services in a general
way. CUG-information describes the more complicated data
structure of a closed user group, while SS-data describes the
data structure of other supplementary services that do not
fall beneath any of the categories listed above.In turn, these data types contain the data that is
specific to respective supplementary services. For example,
in the case of call forwarding services, there is a great
deal of data which is common to these services, and
consequently call forwarding data is generally described in
ForwardingInfo. Thus, supplementary service data is to some
extent general data, and to another extent data which is
specific to a respective

<CLAIMS>
A method, in a network according to a Global System for Mobile
communication (GSM) standard, of receiving data

concerning supplementary services in a mobile services switching
center/visitor location register (MSC/VLR) which have been

signalled via a GSM recommended protocol mobile application part
(MAP) between a home location register (HLR) and MSC/VLR, where

MAP contains sequences of containers for supplementary service
data, where respective containers include a parameter identifying

the supplementary service to which the content of the container
relates, together with service specific data, comprising the

steps of

a) analyzing syntactically subscriber data received in MAP
for identifying respective supplementary services,
b) permitting access to the content of the container for an
identified supplementary service,
c) making the respective supplementary service analyze
syntactically those data types which are included in the

container in accordance with structures particular to the
respective supplementary service, and
d) storing data locally for each supplementary service in
MSC/VLR.
A method according to claim 1, comprising the further
step of using as said parameter a supplementary service code (SS-code)

which is always found in the same location internally
within said container.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the container
content includes at least two data types and said method further

comprises the steps of

A)

1. analyzing syntactically the content of a data type
supplementary service infolist (SS-infolist) which identifies

data types in MAP, in order to identify those containers that are
included in the SS-infolist;
2. identifying a data type supplementary service code 
(SS-code) internally within respective containers;
B)

1. analyzing a value of the SS-code such that new
SS-code values can be a
dded without altering the analysis, a
supplementary service being identified each time the analysis is

performed;
2. requesting from the identified supplementary service
release of the content of the container for use by said

supplementary service, and analyzing internally within said
supplementary service said content;
3. repeating steps B1-2 until all containers have been
gone through and all containers have been delivered to respective

receiving supplementary services, while discarding containers
which do not correspond to a supplementary service.
