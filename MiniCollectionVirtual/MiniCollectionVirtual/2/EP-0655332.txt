<ABSTRACT>
A switchable device (4,6) is arranged in the area (3) parallel to and abutting an outer suspension edge (12) of the slot-shaped printing plate insert (2) for raising a printing plate end. The switchable device comprises a number of nozzles (6) fed with compressed air and which do not project out of the forme cylinder cover. A controlled lifting strip (4) for the printing plate end is provided which can withdraw from the forme cylinder cover on a time basis. A lifting device is arranged in an area close to the outer suspension edge.
