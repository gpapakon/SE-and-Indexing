<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for manufacturing a
membrane for controlled bone regeneration at the height
of a defect in the bone.The durability and success of osteo-integrated implants,
which implants are used for prosthetic reconstructions in
the toothless or partly toothless upper or lower jaw,
mainly depend on the quality and quantity of the bone.
It is assumed that there should be at least 5 mm of bone
around the implant and that the available vertical height
should be at least 10 mm.In many cases, the bone atrophy due to extraction, trauma
or pathology is the cause of a malformed alveolar arch
anatomy. As a result, there is not enough bone height
and width to place implants. In comparison with the
lower maxilla, there is more need for bone correction in
the upper maxilla, because of anatomic restrictions such
as the nasal passage and perinasal sinus, as well as from
an aesthetic point of view, for example in the case where
the patient has a high laugh line.Autogenous as well as allogenous bone transplantations
are known techniques for bone raising. These
transplantations may have the shape of a horseshoe, or
otherwise sections may be provided which are fixed to the
bone whether or not simultaneously with the implants.
Autogenous bone transplantations are disadvantageous in
that the area where the bone is taken from sometimes 
causes more post-surgical discomforts to the patient than
the implant area. Both autogenous and allogenous bone
transplants have varying results. The shape of the
raised alveolar arch is difficult to improve, which
results in aesthetic disadvantages in the upper jaw.EP-A-0097001 discloses a method for making an implantable
prosthetic onlay, in which a digital image is made of an
atrophic bone surface.Another method for bone raising consists in the use of
membranes for controlled bone generation. Such a
biocompatible membrane may consist of
polytetrafluoroethylene such as Gore-tex (W.L. Gore,
Flagstaff, Arizona), of titanium foil or of polyurethane.The regenerating effect with such membranes is based on
the creation of a blood clot in the immediate vicinity of
the required bone regeneration. The membrane encloses
said blood clot and prevents the penetration of
regenerating fibrous tissue in the area which is
stabilized by the membrane. In a crater-shaped defect
may also be provided hydroxylapatite granules.
Osteogenetically active cells will form new bone under
the membrane. The membrane itself may be either or not
reabsorbable.If a relatively large volume needs to be

Method for manufacturing a membrane (11) for
controlled bone regeneration at the height of a defect in

the bone (1), characterized in that a digital image is
made of the bone showing the defect for which an increase

in volume is required by means of a computer-controlled
tomographic scanner, in that a morphologic model (7) is

made of this image on the basis of the information
obtained via the scanner, in that a corresponding mould

(9,10) is made on the basis of said model (7) and in
that, finally, a relatively stiff foil (8) is provided in

the mould (9,10) and put in the required shape with the
help of the mould (9,10).
Method according to the above claim, characterized in
that the defect is scanned and in that an image of the

bone (1) for which a volume increase is required is made
by processing the digital data obtained via said scanning

in a digital manner.
Method according to the above claim, characterized in
that in case of a unilateral defect, the intact area is

scanned and the digital data of the intact area obtained
via this scanning are digitally processed into a mirror

image.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that in
those cases where the patient has a dental prothesis (3),

the required increase in volume of the bone (1) is
determined before the bone showing the defect is scanned,

in that the prothesis (3) is excavated on the basal side 
until the surface (4) of the excavation coincides with

the perimeter of the required increase in volume, in that
said excavation surface is covered with a contrast medium

such that the perimeter of the required increase in
volume is made visible by the scanner, and in that the

outline (6) of the contrast medium is digitally connected
with the bone perimeter via digital processing of the

scanner data.
Method according to the above claim, characterized in
that the excavation of the prothesis (3) is filled again

before it is scanned and put in place again.
Method according to any of the above claims,
characterized in that the morphological model (7) for the

manufacture of the mould (9,10), is made by means of
rapid prototyping or free form manufacturing techniques.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that
the model (7) for the manufacture of the mould (9,10) is

made by stereolithography.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that the
model (7) for the manufacture of the mould (9,10) is made

by milling.
Method according to any of the above claims,
characterized in that as a foil (8) for the membrane (11)

a foil is used made of either of the following materials:
titanium, polytetrafluoroethylene or polyurethane.
