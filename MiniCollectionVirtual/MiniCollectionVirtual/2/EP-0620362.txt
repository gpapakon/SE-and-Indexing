<ABSTRACT>
In a gas turbine assembly which essentially comprises a compressor (2), a first combustion chamber (3), a first turbine (4), a second combustion chamber (5) and a second turbine (6), the first combustion chamber (3) is designed as annular combustion chamber. The said annular combustion chamber (3) is operated with a number of premixing burners (11), which are distributed on the circumference. The first turbine (4) is designed so that its exhaust gases have a temperature level which is higher than the spontaneous combustion temperature of the fuel (13) used in the second combustion chamber (5). The said second combustion chamber (5) comprises a burnerless, annular combustion space in which a number of vortex-generating elements (14) are incorporated. The turbo-machines, that is compressor (2), first turbine (4) and second turbine (6), are arranged on a rotor shaft (1), the said rotor shaft (1) being supported on two bearings (9, 15).

first turbine and a second turbine (6) acting downstream
of the second combustion chamber, the first and

the second combustion chambers having an annular
configuration, characterized in that the second

combustion chamber (5) is designed as a self-igniting
combustion chamber equipped with vortex-generating

elements (14).
Gas turbine group, according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the compressor unit (2) comprises

two compressors which are operationally connected to an

characterized in that the downstream-end surfaces of

the vortex-generating elements (14) form a cross-sectional
discontinuity in the flow cross-section of

the second combustion chamber (5).
Gas turbine group according to Claims [sic] 1,

characterized in that it is possible downstream of the
vortex-generating elements (14) to spray a main fuel

(13) into the second combustion chamber (5).
Gas turbine group according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the main fuel (13) can be

introduced via a number of fuel lances (23), and in
that the fuel lances (23) are arranged in the

circumferential direction of the second combustion

gases (4) in the first turbine (4) is minimized such
that these partially expanded hot gases flow into the

downstream second combustion chamber (5) acting
upstream of the second turbine (6), with a temperature

which is above the self-ignition temperature of a main
fuel (13) sprayed in there, and in which the hot gases

are turbulently mixed in the second combustion chamber
(5).
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the partially expanded hot gases in the second

combustion chamber (5) have an average porosity

>
 60 m/s.
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in
that aids are provided which ensure the self-ignition

should be a fluctuation of the temperature of the gases

in the region where the fuel is sprayed in.
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in
that exhaust gases escaping from the second turbine (6)

flow through a waste-heat steam generator, and in that
steam produced in the waste-heat steam generator acts

on at least one steam turbine operationally connected
to the gas turbine group.
