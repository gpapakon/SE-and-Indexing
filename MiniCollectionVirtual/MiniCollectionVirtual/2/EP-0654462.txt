<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for treating liquid reaction mixtures, as are formed in the production of dimethyl carbonate by oxidative carbonylation of methanol in the presence of a copper-containing catalyst, which process permits a simple separation of the reaction water and the dimethyl carbonate. In this case, in a first distillation column, the reaction water is taken off at the bottom of the column; the overhead product of the first column is separated in a second column under elevated pressure into dimethyl carbonate as bottom product and into an overhead product principally comprising methanol. The overhead product of the second column, principally comprising methanol, produced in the treatment by distillation, is returned to the reaction process.

Process for the preparation of dimethyl carbonate by
reaction of methanol with oxygen and carbon monoxide

in the presence of a copper-containing catalyst
suspended or dissolved in the reaction medium under

increased pressure at elevated temperature, removal
of the catalyst and working-up of the reaction

solution, characterized in that the catalyst-free
reaction solution is initially freed from the water

of reaction as the bottom product in a first
distillation column and the top product, comprising

dimethyl carbonate and methanol, is separated in a
subsequent pressure distillation at elevated

temperature under increased pressure into a bottom
product of pure dimethyl carbonate and a dimethyl

carbonate-depleted, methanolic top product, and the
top product is recycled to the process.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the catalyst-free reaction solution comprises, based

on its total weight, methanol to the extent of 50-90%

by weight, preferably to the extent of 55-80% by
weight, particularly preferably to the extent of 

60-75% by weight, dimethyl carbonate to the extent
of 8-45% by weight, preferably to the extent of

15-40% by weight, particularly preferably to the
extent of 20-37% by weight, and water to the extent

of 0.5-15% by weight, preferably to the extent of
1-10% by weight, particularly preferably to the

extent of 1.5-8% by weight.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the first distillation column for removal of the

water is operated under 0.1 to 8 bar, preferably
under 0.5 to 4 bar and particularly preferably under

0.8 to 3 bar, and for this the bottom of the column
is heated up to 65 to 200°C, preferably 80 to 160°C

and particularly preferably to 90 to 150°C.
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the top product of the first distillation

column is introduced into a second distillation
column and separated under 1 to 20 bar, preferably

4 to 20 bar, particularly preferably under 8 to
15 bar, at a column bottom temperature of 65 to

250°C, preferably 100 to 220°C and particularly
preferably 130 to 200°C, and pure DMC is removed as

the bottom product.
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the top product of the second column is

recycled to the reactor.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that columns with fillings or packings are employed

as distillation columns for removal of the water,
the number of theoretical plates being 1 to 200,

preferably 5 to 100, particularly preferably 10 
to 60.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that tray, filled or packed columns are employed as

distillation columns for the pressure distillation,
the number of theoretical plates being between 1 and

200, preferably 5 to 100, particularly preferably 10
to 60.
