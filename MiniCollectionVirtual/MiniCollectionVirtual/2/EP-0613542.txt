<ABSTRACT>
The present publication discloses a method and an apparatus for drying the fuel used for firing a fluidized-bed boiler (1). The hot, inert solids of the fluidized-bed are circulated by a regulated rate from the furnace (2) to a simple dryer (11) incorporated into the fuel feed line (7) to the boiler (1), whereby the fuel is dried and steam is generated. By virtue of controlled bed solids recirculation, a constant temperature of the dryer (11) can be maintained, thus permitting the omission of all heat transfer surfaces from the dryer (11). The nearly clean steam released from the drying process is routed from the dryer (11) to useful applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for drying the fuel used for firing a fluidized-bed 
boiler. In pulverized-fuel fired power plants, the wet fuel is 
generally dried with the help of stack gases prior to 
being fed into the furnace of the boiler. The drying of 
the fuel is necessary, because burners of pulverized fuel 
require dry fuel for stable combustion. In fluidized-bed 
boilers, the fuel need not be dry for efficient combustion, 
but rather, drying and combustion can take place in 
the fluidized bed, whose heat content is relatively high. In drying with stack gases, the stack gases and the steam 
generated in the drying process will become mixed with 
each other. Heat recovery from the gaseous mix of the 
stack gases and the steam emerging from the drying 
process in not generally economically feasible, because 
the heat of condensation cannot be recovered at a 
sufficiently high temperature, and moreover, the acidic 
components (NOx and SOx) of the stack gases cause strong 
corrosion of the heat exchanger surfaces at temperatures 
below the dew point of water. The fuel can be dried for pulverized fuel firing also 
with the help of different steam-heated dryers in which 
the heat for drying is obtained from steam fed to the 
dryer. The steam is condensed on heat transfer surfaces 
designed into the dryer. Typically, low-pressure steam is 
used at a temperature as low as possible, and the steam 
released from the fuel is not necessarily recovered.  
 An advantageous steam-heated dryer construction known in 
the art is a fluidized-bed steam-heated dryer in which 
the pressure level of dryer exhaust steam is first 
elevated by means of a compressor and the compressed 
steam is then introduced to the steam-condensing surfaces 
of the dryer, whereby the heat of condensation can be 
recovered from the exhaust steam. The drawbacks of such a 
dryer are its high investment costs and relatively high 
internal power consumption of the compressor. The German application publication DE 3,726,643 discloses 
a construction whose use is limited to circulating fluidized-bed 
boilers, in which the entire flow of the circulating 
bed solids is routed to the mixer-type dryer. Typical 
to commercial circulating fluidized-bed boilers, also 
this system uses a heat exchanger construction with cooling 
surfaces as the dryer. In the embodiment described in 
the DE application publication, recirculated steam acts 
as the fluidizing gas. The dryer is provided with heat 
transfer surfaces, because the
