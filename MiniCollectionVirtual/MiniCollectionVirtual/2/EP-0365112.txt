<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer, microporous polyolefin sheet is provided with at 
least two microporous polyolefin layers autogenously bonded together to 

have the same porosity as prior to bonding. The sheet material is formed 
by blending a polyolefin with an additive which separates on cooling, 

extracting the additive from each layer with a solvent after cooling and 
drying the layers in contact to effect bonding. As compared to previous 

laminated products, the product does not have altered porosity at the 
interface nor contamination with bonding agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-layer 
laminates of microporous films and a method for preparing same. Porous and microporous polymer films are well 
known in the art. The process of making these films to 
produce desirable properties usually involves stretching a 
film and this stretching process causes the film to become 
thinner. There are many uses for microporous polymer films 
that are of a thickness that would require non-producible 
extrudates with thick cross-sections from the extruder 
before stretching. These films are not producible due to 
heat transfer, phase separation and precipitation 
limitations. To obtain the required film thickness layers 
of thin film can be laminated together. Traditional bonding of porous polymer materials 
is done with either bonding agents or temperature/pressure 
techniques. Bonding agents or adhesives penetrate a 
significant distance into the pore network of the material 
thereby mechanically locking the layers in place. 
Temperature/pressure methods involve techniques of 
calendering, point bonding with a patterned nip, ultrasonic 
welding and the like. These methods generally alter the 
porosity of the layers at the interfaces and thus adversely 
affect the internal porosity and void volume of the 
laminated film. These methods can also have disadvantages 
of inclusion of non-polymer film material, contamination by 
foreign material, non-continuous interlayer bonding and 
inadequate inter-layer bonding. These boundary layer 
interruptions affect the utility of the layered film as a  
 
continuous, non-blocking and uniform gradient throughout 
the laminate is often desired. U.S. Patent No. 4,650,730 (Lundquist et al.) 
discloses a multiply sheet product useful as a battery 
separator having at least two plies each in the form of a 
microporous sheet of predetermined length and breadth and a 
thickness of less than 10 mils. The multiply sheet product 
is formed in conventional manners such as by coextensively 
overlaying at least one first sheet with at least one 
second sheet and subjecting them to nip rollers, 
calendering or the like. Alternatively, the sheet product 
can be formed by coating a second sheet with a first 
composition, normally of polymer and plasticizer, and then 
removing the plasticizer. U.S. Patents No. 4,385,093 and No. 4,478,665 
(Hubis) disclose a multi-component, porous polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE) article. Components of PTFE containing a 
liquid lubricant are placed in intimate contact, dried to 
remove the liquid

<CLAIMS>
A method of making multi-layer, microporous 
polyolefin sheet materials comprising the steps of 


(a) forming at least two polyolefin 
layers by melt blending the polyolefin with an additive 

which is miscible with the polymer at the melt temperature 
of the blend but which phase separates on cooling, forming 

a layer from the blend, cooling the layer at a rate and 
to a temperature to initiate non-equilibrium phase 

separation, and cooling to solidify the layer; 
(b) extracting the additive from each layer with a 
solvent capable of swelling the polyolefin and contacting 

the solvent wet layers or contacting the solvent wet 
layers and extracting the additives from the contacting 

layers; and 
(c) drying the contacting layers to remove the 
solvent and effect bonding between the contacting layers. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising 
orienting said sheet material. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said layers have 
the same porosities. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said layers have 
different porosities. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said layers are of 
the same polyolefin material. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said layers are of 
different polyolefin material. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said polyolefin is 
polyethylene, polypropylene or a combination thereof.  

 
A multi-layer, microporous polyolefin sheet 
material having layers autogenously bonded and having 

substantially the same porosity as prior to bonding prepared 
according to the method of any one of claims 1-7.
