<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for 
manufacturing radiator elements for central 

heating plants, comprising a deep-drawing phase in 
which a half-shell (1) is formed, provided with a 

cylindrical element (9) coaxial to a through-hole 
(8) and a thread-making phase of the internal 

surface of the said cylindrical element (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for
manufacturing radiator elements for central
heating plants.In particular, the invention relates to internally
hollow radiator elements provided with holes for
passage of a thermal carrier fluid, which elements
are usually connected one to another by means of
nipples situated at the passage fluid holes.At present radiator elements are constructed by
means of substantially two process categories, the
first of which envisages casting processes,
normally using cast iron or aluminium alloys,
while the second envisages sheet metal (usually
steel) pressing to produce a half-shell, which is
subsequently welded, usually flash-welded, to an
identical half-shell. The present invention
belongs to the second above category.Some known processes construct radiators using two
different types of radiator element. The first
type is an intermediate radiator element, 
comprising a head-piece obtained by welding
together two half-shells. Pipes are welded,
usually flash-welded, to the head pieces. By
varying the length of the pipes radiator elements
of different heights can be obtained.The second type has an end element consisting in
an intermediate element on one side of which
internally-threaded pipe-couplings are welded,
usually at the fluid passage holes.Figure 5 shows a part of a half-shell of the
second type of radiator, comprising a pipe-coupling.
The pipe-couplings are provided with
coupling nipples for a connection of the radiator
to a thermal-carrier fluid distribution plant, or
for its connection to another end radiator
element.The complete radiator is made up of an assembly of
the above elements. Assembly is generally
performed by spot-welding at the fluid passage
holes.Other processes exist in which radiator elements
are made which have four threaded pipe-couplings,
two for each side of the element, which are welded
at the fluid passage holes. The assembly of the
radiator in this case comprises the use of nipples 
to connect each radiator element to the another.A drawback of the radiators made with the above
known processes is that stocking the elements
necessary for the construction of the radiators is
costly, since different types of elements are used
as well as different types of components for the
elements.A further drawback is that the assembly of a
radiator requires a high number of welding
operations.A principal aim of the present invention is to
eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks by
providing a process which enables the work times
and operations necessary for

<CLAIMS>
A process for making radiator elements for central
heating plants, comprising the following phases:


making an initial hole (7) in a unit of sheet
metal (6) having predetermined size and shape;
a deep-drawing of the holed sheet metal unit (6)
wherein the said unit is plastically deformed between

two half-dies of a drawing press to form a half-shell (1)

provided with a through hole (8) made on the initial
hole (7) previously obtained:
bringing together and welding together two half-shells
(1) to obtain an internally hollow single

internally hollow radiator element;

characterised in that:
the initial hole (7) has a smaller diameter than the
through hole (8); during the deep-drawing of the holed sheet (6) to form the

half-shell (1) an annular
crown (5) is formed having a height which is about equal to a

difference between the through hole (8) diameter and
the initial hole (7) diameter;
subsequently during the deep-drawing phase,
the two half-dies (2,

3) of the drawing press act for bending the annular
crown (5) forming thus a cylindrical element (9) which

is coaxial to the through hole (8); 
after the deep-drawing phase, there is a
thread-making phase on an internal surface of the

cylindrical element (9).
A process as in claim 1, characterised in that the initial
hole (7) is obtained directly at the drawing press.
A process as in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the threading phase is

performed by a rolling technique.
A process as in any one of the previous
claims, characterised in that the welding

is performed by a TIG process.
A process as in any one of the previous
claims, characterised in that a surface of

the radiator element (1) undergoes an anti-corrosion
treatment.
