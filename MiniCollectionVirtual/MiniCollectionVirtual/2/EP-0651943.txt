<ABSTRACT>
A boot for horses' hooves made of flexible material, comprising 
a sole part (12) and an 

integral part (14) forming an upper, has inner slots (24) at the back 
between the sole part (12) and 

the upper part (19) to accommodate the protruding rear parts of the 
horseshoe. The 

engagement of these rear parts or "calks" of the horseshoes, 
together with the 

tapered shape of the upper, holds the boot on the hoof. The 
boot preferably extends 

just high enough to cover the hoof without covering the fleshy 
parts of the foot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of protective covers or boots for animals 
feet. It is known for a rubber boot to be used for animals' hooves or for a rubber sheet to 
be placed between the hoof and the horseshoe to exploit the shock-absorbing effect 
of this material. There are various types of boots on the market, generally intended to 
protect the hoof if the shoe is accidentally cast, or for emergency or systematic 
replacement of horseshoes. A problem with these boots is ensuring that they stay on 
the hoof. In particular, the boots made of India rubber currently on the market comprise a sole 
part and an integral upper part. The upper is relatively high so that it encloses not 
only the hoof but a part of the foot above it and it is fixed to the foot by means of 
various types laces and in some cases by means of toothed steel clamps inside the 
boot that bite into the side walls of the hoof. A drawback of these types of boots is that they can damage the hoof because of the 
grip exerted by the teeth on the side walls of the hoof. Moreover, contact with hair 
and skin can give rise to lesions and possible maceration, yet this contact is 
unavoidable because otherwise the boot would not remain firmly anchored to the 
hoof.  
 CH-A-153341 to Dallmeier discloses a boot made of flexible elastic material for 
hoofed animals according to the preamble of claim 1. The boot of Dallmeier is intentionally in the shape of a horseshoe and 
accommodates and protects only the horny part of the horse's foot since the result 
sought was to have the frog free, and possibly to allow to easily apply the boot. However this fact makes the Dallmeier boot only fit for an emergency, and not for 
long distances since it does not grant a good protection and it can be easily slipped, 
due to the combination between the little height and the excessive deformability 
caused by the U shape.  
 The aim of this invention is to create a protective boot for hoofed animals, and more 
particularly for shod horses, that stays firmly anchored to the foot and yet does not 
damage the structure of the foot itself. Another aim is to provide for the foot to be 
well protected and well cushioned from impact. A further aim is to allow the boot to 
be fitted on shod hooves; yet another aim is to make it possible for the animal to wear 
the boot for a long time without any particular damage.  
 These aims and others still have been achieved with a boot as claimed in claim 1. 
Further new and useful features are stated in the

<CLAIMS>
A boot made of flexible elastic material, for hoofed animals, comprising a 
sole part (12) and an upper part (14) that are integral with each other and define a 

seat to accommodate a shoe with protruding heel parts fitted to the animal's hoof 
and slots (24) at the back for said protruding heel parts of the shoe, said slots being 

defined at the top by elastic check tooth/teeth (26), the height of the upper part at 

the front, sides and back being such as not to exceed the height of the walls of the 
animal's hoof, characterized in that said seat (34) is defined in a boot housing 

having shape and size to accommodate the animal's foot whereby at least the whole 
underside of the animal's foot, including the frog, is covered.  

 
A boot according to claim 1 characterized in that said tooth/teeth 
comprises/comprise a single tooth defining a hollow for the protruding heel parts of the shoe. 
A boot according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in that said check 
tooth/teeth has/have a sloping tapered upper surface and a sharply projecting lower 

surface (30). 
A boot according to claim 1 characterized in that said seat (34) is defined 
by an arc-shaped internal projection (32) of the boot sole. 
A boot according to claim 1 characterized in that the upper part has a slit 
(20) at the front that extends upwards; and in that the boot further comprises a front-tying 

lace element (35) anchored or passed in a back part of the boot. 
A boot according to claim 5 characterized in that it also has two through 
holes (36) at the back part to hook or anchor said lace element (35).
