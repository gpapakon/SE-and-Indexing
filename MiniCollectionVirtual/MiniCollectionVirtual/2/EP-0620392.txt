<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for eliminating abrupt variations in pressure in a moving vehicle placed in a pipe (10, 11) connecting the inside of the vehicle to the outside. It comprises at least one shut-off element (14, 15) leaving a passage (23, 24) for the flow of air and at least one partition (16) which can be deformed under the effect of the air pressure. In the event of an abrupt variation between the pressures on the inside and on the outside of the vehicle, the partition is pressed against the passage of the shut-off element in order to shut it off totally or partially. Application to rail vehicles.
