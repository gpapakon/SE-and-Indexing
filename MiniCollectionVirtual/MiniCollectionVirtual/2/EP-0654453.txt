<ABSTRACT>
A device for coating an optical fibre, for example a glass fibre drawn from a glass preform, has a housing (3) having a longitudinal hole (11) and into which a nozzle holder (13) having an accommodation bore (25) is pressed. An inlet nozzle (33) and an outlet nozzle (43), through which the optical fibre (1) can be passed, are pressed at a distance from each other into the accommodation bore (25) of the nozzle holder (13). A coating space for the application of a coating material to the optical fibre (1) is provided between the inlet nozzle (33) and the outlet nozzle (43). As a result of the pressing-in of the nozzles (33, 43) into the nozzle holder (13) and the pressing-in of the nozzle holder (13) into the housing, a better reproducibility of the positioning of the nozzles (33, 43) is achieved during the assembly of the device.

Apparatus for coating an optical fibre, having 

a housing having a longitudinal bore, 
a nozzle holder which is arranged in this longitudinal 
bore and has a receiving bore, 
an inlet nozzle with a first nozzle bore and an 
outlet nozzle with a second nozzle bore, through 

which the optical fibre can be guided and which are 
arranged at a distance one behind the other in the 

receiving bore of the nozzle holder, and 
a coating space formed between the inlet nozzle and 
the outlet nozzle for applying a coating material to 

the optical fibre, characterized in that 
the nozzle holder (13) is pressed into the longitudinal 
bore (11) of the housing (3), and 
the inlet nozzle (33) and the outlet nozzle (43) are 
pressed into the receiving bore (25) of the nozzle 

holder (13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the nozzle holder (13) is made from a material with 

a low coefficient of sliding friction. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the housing (3), in the region of the 

longitudinal bore (11), is made, at least in the section 
where the nozzle holder (13) is pressed in and out, from 

a material with a low coefficient of sliding friction. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the inlet nozzle (33) and/or the 

outlet nozzle (43) are made, at least on their periphery, 
from a material with a low coefficient of sliding  

 
friction. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the nozzle holder (13) is made from 

an elastic synthetic material. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the housing (3), in the region of 

the longitudinal bore (11), is made, at least in the 
section where the nozzle holder (13) is pressed in and 

out, from an elastic synthetic material. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the inlet nozzle (33) and/or the 

outlet nozzle (43) is made, at least on its periphery, 
from an elastic synthetic material. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that polytetrafluoroethylene is used as 

the material with a low coefficient of sliding friction. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, upstream of the inlet nozzle (33) 

in the passage direction of the fibre (1), a baffle plate 
(107) is pressed into the receiving bore (25) of the 

nozzle holder (13), through the aperture (108) of which 
baffle plate the fibre (1) can be guided. 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the diameter of the aperture (108) of the baffle 

plate (107) is smaller at its narrowest point than the 
diameter of the first nozzle bore (35) of the inlet 

nozzle (33) at its narrowest point and is greater than 
the diameter of the second nozzle bore (45) of the outlet 

nozzle (43) at its narrowest point. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the apparatus is sealed towards the 

outside by means of sealing rings (73, 79, 89, 95, 97, 
99) acting in the axial direction.
