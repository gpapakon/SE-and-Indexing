<ABSTRACT>
A gate power MOSFET on substrate (20) has a P-body layer (26), N-drain layer (24) and optional P+ layer (22) for IGBT. Layer (30) on surface (28) patterns areas (46) as stripes or a matrix, and protected areas. Sidewall spacers (44) of thickness (52) contact layer (30). Trench (50) in areas (46) has sidewalls aligned to spacer surfaces (47) and extending depthwise through P-body layer (26) to depth (56). Oxide (60) on the trench walls and gate polysilicon (62) refills trench (50) to level (64) near surface (28). Oxide (68) between spacers (44) covers polysilicon (62). Removing layer (30) exposes surface (28') between surfaces (48). Source layer (72) is doped atop the body layer (26') and then trenched to form trench (80) having sidewalls aligned to surfaces (48). Trench (80) defines vertically-oriented source and body layers (86, 90) stacked along oxide layer (60) to form vertical channels on opposite sides of trench (80). Layers (86, 90) have a lateral thickness (88) of the sidewall spacers. Conductor (94) contacts the N-source and P-body layers, and an enhanced P+ region in trench (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to power MOS field-effect devices,
which includes power MOSFETs, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT),
MOS controlled thyristors and the like, and more particularly to recessed
gate, rectangular-grooved or U-grooved power MOS field effect devices,
commonly referred to as RMOSFETs or UMOSFETs.Power MOSFETs have been recognized as providing a number of
advantages over power bipolar transistors, particularly in regard to fast
switching response, high input impedance and high thermal stability. A major
disadvantage of power MOSFETs is their large ON-resistance and forward
voltage drop compared to bipolar transistors. Significant efforts have gone
into reducing the ON-resistance per unit area. These efforts include reducing
the cell size of the devices to increase cell density, but the ability to do this
in conventional VDMOS devices is limited by the presence of a parasitic
junction FET between adjacent cells which increases ON-resistance as the
device structure is scaled to smaller cell sizes. K. Shenai, "Optimally Scaled
Low-Voltage Vertical Power MOSFET's for High Frequency Power
Conversion" IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, Vol. 37, No. 2, April, 1990
describes how the VDMOS device structure, having the gate and channel
extending horizontally along the top surface of the semiconductor substrate,
is inherently limited in density, necessitating other measures to reduce ON-resistance.To avoid this inherent limitation, another class of power MOS field-effect
devices has been developed using a recessed gate, in which the gate
and channel are formed vertically along a sidewall of a channel or trench
etched in the semiconductor substrate. These devices include rectangular- 
grooved or U-grooved power MOS field effect devices, commonly referred to
as RMOSFETs or UMOSFETs. An early device of this type appears in U.S.
Pat. No. 4,070,690 to Wickstrom. The source, channel and drain are formed
by successive layers deposited on a substrate and trenched through for gate
oxide formation and gate metal deposition on sidewalls of the trench. A
variation of this approach, called the VMOS, is shown in U.S. Pat. No.
4,145,703 to Blanchard et al. Subsequently, it was recognized that the
vertical channel orientation in this type of device could be scaled down to
increase cell density without parasitic junction FET effects and thereby
reduce ON-resistance below the inherent limitations of VDMOS devices.
