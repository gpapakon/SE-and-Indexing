<ABSTRACT>
Method for the deposition of supramolecular 
systems, biomolecules and, in general molecules of 

large size and/or complexity and/or lability, 
essentially comprising a combination of the following 

operations: 

vaporization, by electromagnetic radiation 
absorption or other mechanisms, and ionization, induced 

by at least one short laser radiation pulse, of the 
above molecules; 
driving of the ionized molecules in an electric 
field or by mean of masks; and 
deposition of the ionized molecules on the 
desired support. 
The figure shows an example in which the deposited 
molecules maintain their integrity. Curve A shows 

the mass spectrum of the deposited material, vaporized 
from a sample of tryptophyl-leucine adhering to a 

stainless steel surface; whereas curve B shows the 
mass spectrum of the same material, deposited following 

ionization and application of the electric field, 
analyzed by means of further laser-induced vaporization 

and ionization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for the 
deposition of supramolecular systems, biomolecular 
systems and, in general, molecules of'large size and/or 
complexity and/or lability without fragmentation and/or 
loss of their structural and functional properties. As it is known, the potential use of certain 
organic polymers and certain biological molecules to 
form low dissipation and low noise electronic devices 
has been recognized for some years now. Organic and 
biological conductors, proteins acting as biological 
semiconductors and even polymers with LED (Light 
Emitting Diode) properties are known. Furthermore, 
"biomimetic" supramolecular systems with semiconductor 
properties have been created, by covalent bonding of 
molecules that are widely used in nature. However, in 
practical production of electronic devices, however 
elementary, one encounters the difficulty of depositing 
the various single component molecules, in their due 
locations, on an adequate support with nanometric or 
subnanometric resolution. All the deposition methods that can be used for 
this type of molecule produce deposits of macroscopic 
dimensions, although extremely thin (molecular 
monolayer). Recent use of scanning probe microscopes 
(Scanning Probe Microscope, Atomic Force Microscope) 
now makes it possible to cut a molecular monolayer and 
remove, with nanometric resolution, the deposited 
material from the whole of the support with the 
exception of the required sites; alternatively it is 
possible to create masks to carry out deposition. However, these "nanolithographic" methods are not 
considered practicable, except in the case of 
scientific demonstrations. (They have been efficiently 
compared with the construction of a suspension bridge 
by carving it out of a single block of metal, rather  
 
than by assembling the various components as required). The method according to the present invention, on 
the contrary, can be used to create a molecular assembly 
on a support according to patterns of whatever 
complexity. It is, in fact, based on a non-destructive 
ionization of the molecules to be deposited and on 
electric field assisted deposition, said field being easy 
to localize and move with atomic resolution. More specifically, the subject of the present 
invention is a method for the deposition of 
supramolecular systems, biomolecules and, in general, 
molecules of large size and/or complexity and/or 
lability, comprising a combination of the following 
operations:
