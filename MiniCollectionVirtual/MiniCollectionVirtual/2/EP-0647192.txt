<ABSTRACT>
A chain wheel adapter for bicycle cranks can be used to equip new bicycles or to convert already used bicycles. The adapter has a rotationally symmetrical main part (22, 23, 52) which can be inserted on the inner bearing shaft of a bicycle and which is provided around its circumference with axially parallel grooves (26) for securing against rotation chain wheels (4, 5, 6) provided with inner projections to be inserted thereon. The main part may receive up to five chain wheels and corresponding spacer rings (12), as well as fastening means. On the side of the frame, the main part may have a right-hand thread (29) for screwing a locknut or the smallest chain wheel (7) and on the side of the pedal crank it may have a stop flange (9) or a left-hand thread (28) for screwing a locknut (31). Alternatively, the main part may have on the side of the frame a stop flange (54) and on the side of the pedal crank either a left-hand thread or a left-hand bayonet joint for securing the outermost screwed chain wheel (56) or a support washer (64) with a toothed ring (62).
