<ABSTRACT>
Plate-and-container assemblies (20) in which integrally formed or separately fabricated arrays of glass holder components (28, 30, 32) are employed to detachably couple container (24) to the plate (22) of the assembly. The container (24) may be a beverage can. Separate caps (176) may be provided for any number of beverage container styles to fit a generic glass holder. A radially extending slot (142) may be provided on the cap (176) through which a straw (110) may be provided to facilitate drinking of the beverage in the container (24). Indicia on the upper, food-receiving surface on the plate facilitate the assembling of the glass to the plate (22); and an optional drinking straw port (192) provides a convenient way of locking the plate (22) and glass together and always makes it possible to reach the contents of the glass without removing the plate. The glass holder may comprise rails (76) which accommodate beverage cans having rims with two or more different diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLATE-AND-GLASS ASSEMBLIESTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to plates and glasses for serving food and drink. More particular¬ ly, the present invention relates to novel, improved assemblies of a plate and a glass which is attachable to the plate to form a unit which can be handled with one hand and to components for such assemblies.The terms "plate" and "glass" are employed herein in a broad, generic sense. The term "plate" is intended to embrace such diverse artifacts as individ¬ ual eating dishes and different types of serving dishes. "Glass" encompasses: containers convention¬ ally named by that term, beverage and soup cups; insulated, screw top beverage containers; etc.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA number of situations exist in which the use of conventional plates and glasses is difficult. For example, at parties, picnics, and other social gatherings, guests are often obligated to stand or walk about while eating and drinking. Inevitably, they are forced to hold their plate in one hand and their glass in the other. This does not leave free a hand with which to eat. Therefore, the guest must first seek out a resting place for at least the glass. Not only is this inconvenient, but the availability of suitable resting places is frequently quite limited at a social gathering. Furthermore, a guest may be unable to subsequently identify his drink and may 

recover someone else's drink by mistake. It is also frequently difficult to carry a separate plate and glass through a buffet line or when returning to one's seat at a sporting event or movie theater. Several different assemblies for eliminating the need to use both hands to carry a plate and a glass have been proposed. One is shown in U.S. patent No. 2,240,020 issued April 29, 1941 to Raiser. That assembly includes a plate having a central aperture for a cup and a hollow handle which extends downwardly from the cup-receiving receptacle. Although this device permits one to carry both the plate and cup with one handf the cup is not actually attached to the plate and is thus easily dislodged or overturned. Furthermore, liquid can readily slosh over the open top of the cup and onto the food. Still further, the food on the plate can easily come into contact with and foul the exterior of the drinking cup; and food may slosh through the opening in the plate and pass through the hollow handle onto an underlying table or lap.U.S. patent No. 2,920,804 issued January 12, 1960, to Minton discloses a somewhat similar assembly in which a
