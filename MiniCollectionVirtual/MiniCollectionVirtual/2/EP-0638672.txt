<ABSTRACT>
The card clothing for flats of a carding machine comprises a carrier arrangement (2, 6, 8) and a flat clothing resting on and fastened to the latter. A particularly simple design can be achieved if the carrier arrangement consists of at least two components (2) fixedly connected to one another by means of the flat clothing. The flat clothing consists of a plurality of saw-tooth wire strips (1) arranged parallel to one another. At their ends, these each have a toothless portion (5) consisting only of a foot part (4) and at least one carrier component has a fastening batten limiting a bearing face of the saw-tooth wire strips on the carrier component (2). The saw-tooth wire strips bear on the fastening batten (6), and the fastening batten engages over the toothless portions of the saw-tooth wire strips in order to provide a press fastening.

Card clothing for flats of a carding machine, 
with a carrier arrangement (2, 6, 8) and with a flat 

clothing (1) resting on and fastened to the latter, it 
being possible for the carrier arrangement to be fixed to 

the flat, and having two elements (2) fixedly connected 
to one another by means of the flat clothing to form a 

self-supporting arrangement, characterized in that the 
elements (2) are carrier components of the card clothing 

and, together with the flat clothing (1), form a 
downwardly open T-shaped recess (10) in such a way that 

the card clothing can be fastened by being pushed onto a 
T-shaped projection formed on the flat. 
Card clothing according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the flat clothing consists of a plurality of saw-tooth 

wire strips (1) arranged parallel to one another. 
Card clothing according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the saw-tooth wire strips (1) have at each of 

their ends a toothless portion (5) consisting only of a 
foot part (4), at least one carrier component (2) has a 

fastening batten (6) limiting a bearing surface of the 
saw-tooth wire strips (1) on the carrier component (2), 

the saw-tooth wire strips (1) bear on the fastening 
batten (6), and the fastening batten engages over the 

toothless portions (5) of the saw-tooth wire strips (1) 
to form a press fastening. 
Card clothing according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the toothless portions (5) of the saw-tooth wire 

strips (1), over which the fastening batten (6) engages, 
have a bead (7).
