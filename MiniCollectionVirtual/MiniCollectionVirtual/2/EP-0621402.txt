<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus of fuel
injection and ignition of an internal combustion engine
which burns and converts fuel such as gasoline, diesel
fuel, natural gas, alcohol, hydrogen, etc. into power,
and a method thereof.In internal combustion engines, in order to improve
fuel consumption efficiency, it is necessary to form a
lean fuel-air mixture which is low in fuel concentration,
to rise thermal efficiency by making a high compression
ratio and burn instantaneously the lean fuel-air mixture.In Figs. 2a to 2f, various kinds of conventional
combustion methods of spark ignition engines such as
gasoline engines are illustrated in schematic diagrams of
combustion conditions viewed from upper side.Fig.2a shows a general case of engines, wherein a
flame kernel is formed in a fuel-air mixture by an spark
plug 3, and the flame is propagated in the circumference
to burn the fuel-air mixture. This combustion method has
a defect that the flame blows out midway the combustion
when the mixture gas is lean. Further, the flame 
propagation is slow, and the thermal efficiency is low.As measures against these defects, it is proposed
to arrange a plurality of spark plugs,as shown in Fig.
2b, however, the arrangement of the spark plugs can not
be optimized because of the presence of an intake valve
and an exhaust valve (not shown).Further, a method of forming ignition sources by
mixing exhaust gas of high temperature into a fuel-air
mixture is proposed, as shown in Fig. 2c. However, the
positions of the ignition sources change each engine
cycle, so that the thermal efficiency is low.On the other hand, a method of promoting the flame
propagation by increasing energy of an spark plug 3 to
produce high temperature plasma, and jetting it into a
combustion chamber, as shown in Fig. 2d. However,
penetration force of the plasma is small, and the thermal
efficiency is low.Further, as for the plasma as shown in Fig. 2d, a
method of forming activated jet as described in SAE
Technical paper 910565 is proposed, however, force of the
jet is small, and blown away by flow of the fuel-air
mixture, so that any sufficient effect can not be
brought, as yet.Further, as shown in Fig. 2e, there is proposed a
method of promoting flame propagation by providing an
auxiliary chamber 22, burning a fuel-air mixture in the
auxiliary chamber 22 by an spark plug 3, and jetting a
torch flame into a combustion chamber 21. However, a 
surface area of the combustion chamber 21 become larger
than the auxiliary chamber 22, so that thermal
