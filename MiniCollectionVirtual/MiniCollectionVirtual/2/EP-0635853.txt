<ABSTRACT>
A nanocrystalline alloy wherein at least 50 volume % of 
an alloy structure consists of a crystal grain mainly comprising bcc-phase 

having a grain size of 50 nm or less, a saturation magnetic 
flux density of the alloy is 1 T or more, a remanent flux density of 

the alloy is 0.4 T or less, and an Fe-B compound phase is partially 
formed in the alloy. The nanocrystalline alloy produced by heat 

treatment without applying any magnetic field shows pulse 
attenuation characteristics comparable to or more excellent than 

those of a nanocrystalline alloy obtained by heat treatment in a 

magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nanocrystalline alloy having
excellent pulse attenuation characteristics and a method of producing it.
The present invention further relates to a choke coil utilising the nanocrystalline
alloy and a noise filter composed of the choke coil.As a material for a magnetic core of a common-mode choke
coil used in a noise filter, a high permeability material having excellent
high-frequency properties such as ferrite, amorphous alloy, etc. has been
used. EP-A-0 271 657, which corresponds to JP-B-4-4393, discloses that
an Fe-based fine crystalline alloy (nanocrystalline alloy) is suitable as a
material for such a magnetic core because it has a high permeability and
low core loss. The document discloses a nanocrystalline alloy with the
features included in the first part of claim 1, and a method of producing
such alloy with the steps included in the first part of claim 11.The material for a common-mode choke coil used in a noise
filter (line filter) is further required to have not only a high permeability
but also excellent pulse attenuation characteristics for preventing disordered
operating of an apparatus due to high-voltage pulse noise caused
by thunder, etc.However, since the ferrite material, which has been conventionally
used, is low in saturation magnetic flux density, it easily reaches a
magnetically-saturated state. This results in a problem that a small-sized
core made of the ferrite material cannot meet the above requirements and
such a core shows only insufficient efficiency. Therefore, a large-sized
core is necessary for obtaining a high efficiency when ferrite is used as the
core material. An Fe-based amorphous alloy has a high saturation magnetic
flux density and shows, with respect to a high-voltage pulse noise, more
excellent attenuation characteristics than those shown by the ferrite
material. However, since the permeability of the Fe-based amorphous
alloy is lower than that of a Co-based amorphous alloy, it shows insufficient
attenuation to a low-voltage noise. In addition, the Fe-based
amorphous alloy has a remarkably large magnetostriction. This invites
further problems such as alteration in its properties caused by a resonance
which may occur at a certain frequency due to the magnetostriction, and
occurrence of beat in case of including audio frequency component.On the other hand, a Co-based amorphous alloy shows a large
attenuation to low-voltage noise due to its high permeability. However, its
saturation magnetic flux density is lower than IT or less and
