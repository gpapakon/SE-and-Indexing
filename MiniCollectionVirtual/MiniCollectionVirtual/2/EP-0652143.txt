<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for carrying out an automatic braking operation. The object of the invention is to further reduce the braking distance needed for braking. The object of the invention is achieved in that the brake pressure generated on each axle in carrying out the automatic braking operation is increased to such an extent that the antilock system detects the attainment of the locking limit of at least one wheel of the axle. A reduction of the braking distance compared to the known automatic braking operation is accordingly achieved in that the brake pressure is not only increased to such an extent that one wheel of the vehicle attains the locking limit but that the brake pressure of the individual axles is increased until at least one wheel of the said axle attains the locking limit. The maximum power transmission between wheel and road surface is thereby utilised on each axle.

<CLAIMS>
Process for carrying out an automatic braking procedure for vehicles with an anti-locking
system, whereby an automatic braking procedure is carried out on fulfilment of a

release criterion, whereby a pressure which is greater than that arising from the position
of the brake-pedal is produced, during the automatic braking procedure, and whereby the

automatic braking-procedure is ended following the fulfilment of an interruption criterion,

characterized in that

during the automatic braking-procedure, a brake-pressure is produced, on each axle (front
axle (FA) and rear axle (RA)), such that at least one wheel of at least one axle reaches the

anti-locking threshold, whereby the reaching of the locking-threshold of the separate
wheels is determined by the anti-locking system, the increase in brake-pressure occurs, up

to the point where the locking-threshold of the axle which is first to lock (front axle (VA))

is reached, by means of the main brake-cylinder (13, 14), and, for further increase in
brake-pressure on the other axle (rear axle (RA)), at least one source (21f, 21r) of pressure

is present for the brake-medium, and whereby the brake-pressure produced on the other
axle is regulated by means of at least one control valve (22f, 22r).
Process in accordance with claim 1,

characterized in that

there is a pressure-source (21f, 21r) for each axle (FA, RA).
Process in accordance with claim 1,

characterized in that

the minimum single pressure-source (21f, 21r) is the pressure-source of a drive-slip
regulating means.
Process in accordance with claim 2,

characterized in that

the pressure-source and control valves of a drive-slip regulation means are used as the
pressure-source (21f, 21r) and control valves (22f, 22r) of the driven vehicle axles.
Process in accordance with claim 1,
 
characterized in that

the maximum pressure which can be produced at any one time, on each axle (FA, RA),
has a certain limit.
