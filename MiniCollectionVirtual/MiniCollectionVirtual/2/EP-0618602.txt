<ABSTRACT>
The switch has a rotary knob (1) with a disc (3) mechanically attached to its shaft (2) which incorporates angularly spaced characters (4) for indicating the selected switch setting. Each of the characters is transparent and is selectively illuminated by a rear light source, the illuminated character viewed via a window (6) in a screen (5) lying in front of the disc. A switch (9) is mechanically coupled to the rotary knob and electrically coupled to the light source for controlling the latter in dependence on the selected setting and temporarily switching the light source off when the knob is being moved between 2 different settings.

<CLAIMS>
Switching device for an electrical device which is 
operable in a number of stages, particularly for a 

cooking ring or an oven of an electric stove, with an 
operating element (1), which controls the operational 

stages of the electrical device, and with a visual 
display, which indicates the operational s
tages, with a 
movable information carrier (3), which is mechanically 

coupled to the operating element (1), bearing translucent 
symbols (4), with a shield (5), which is arranged in 

front of the information carrier (3), with a viewing 
window (6) for the symbols (4) on the information carrier 

(3) , and with a light source arranged behind the 
information carrier (3), characterised by a switch (9), 

which is mechanically coupled to the operating element 
(1) and electrically coupled to the light source, for 

controlling the light source in dependence on the 
operational stages of the electrical device, the switch 

being so coupled to the operating element and the light 
source that the light source is switched off and on again 

each time the operational stage is changed. 
Switching device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised by an acoustic signal emitter, which is 

mechanically coupled to the operating element (1), for 
indicating the changes in the operational stages. 
Switching device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the operating element (1) is 

constructed as a rotary knob and is arranged on a shaft 
(2), that the information carrier (3) is constructed as 

a disc and is arranged on the shaft (2) of the rotary 
knob and that the switch (9) has a rotary finger (7),  

 
operating on a conductive plate (8), which is arranged on 

the shaft (2) of the rotary knob.
