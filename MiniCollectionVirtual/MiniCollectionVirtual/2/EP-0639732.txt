<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuously variable transmission. 
The continuously variable transmission according to the invention is 

designed in such a way that in operating conditions to be defined in more 
detail the transmission ratio is kept essentially constant, in particular 

for travelling through bends, on inclines and in case of an emergency 
stop. The constant transmission ratio is obtained by regulating the input 

r.p.m. of the transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a continuously variable transmission as defined by the features of the preamble of claim 1.Such a continuously variable transmission is known from WO-A-9300533.The object of the invention is to provide an improved
transmission. This object is achieved by the features of claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment, the first control valve is
set in a leakage-compensating condition.According to a preferred embodiment, the continuously variable
transmission may further comprise a second control valve disposed in a
hydraulic line between the first control valve and the piston-cylinder
unit of the first pulley and operable to shut off said hydraulic line, 
and an ON/OFF solenoid to control said second control valve at
specified other operating conditions. In a further embodiment of the transmission according to the
invention, the first and/or second control valve is also in the form of a
safety valve, in such a way that if there is a power failure the supply
and/or discharge of medium from the first control valve to the piston-cylinder
unit is interrupted and the transmission ratio of the
transmission can change only gradually.According to the invention, the second control valve can also
be designed as a reversing block, in such a way that at forward vehicle
speeds above a predetermined value any control signal for the activation
of a reversing mechanism is blocked. For this purpose, in one embodiment
a control signal for the activation of a reversing mechanism can be
conveyed through the second control valve, and the second control valve
is provided with an input for a signal corresponding to or as a measure
for the vehicle speed. The first and/or second control valve can also be
designed as a speed limiter.In particular, the continuously variable transmission according
to the invention is designed in such a way that the transmission ratio is
kept essentially constant in the event of an emergency stop, when
travelling on inclines, and when travelling in bends.According to the invention, an emergency stop situation can be
diagnosed, inter alia, if the difference between the desired value and 
the measured value of the input speed of the transmission exceeds a
predetermined value and the vehicle speed falls below a predetermined
value. On the other hand, the diagnosis of an emergency stop situation in
the transmission can be cancelled if the desired and the measured value
of the input speed of the transmission are approximately equal again.
The transmission is thus controlled to
