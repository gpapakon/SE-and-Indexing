<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of filling a gap in a pipe coating
and a pipe obtained thereby.Many subsea flowlines are coated to insulate the pipe thermally
and/or to provide anticorrosion properties. The coatings typically comprise
solid, foam or microsphere-filled materials.The coated pipe, typically of steel, is provided in sections with
bare terminal portions of the steel pipe and the coating gaps are about 50 to
400mm long uncoated. These bare terminal portions known in the art as
"cut backs" allow the pipes to be joined by welding without thermal
degradation of the coating.The product of this step is a pipe string with 100-800 mm uncoated
cut backs at intervals. In order to maintain the anticorrosion and/or
insulation properties of the string the coating gaps at the cutbacks should be
filled.EP 164 323 describes a method of filling the cut backs of a pipe
provided with an insulating coating. A tubular sleeve of polyester is
provided over the field joint with a longitudinal slot left open. All but the 
ends of the slot are covered with a light curable polyester strip which is
cured in place. Polyisocyanate precursor is injected into the mould space
formed and allowed to cure.A prior art method of filling the coating gaps in polyolefin coated
pipes involves extruding melted foam or solid polyolefin into a mould
bridging the cutback coating gap. A number of problems result from this
approach.First the polyolefin used is very non-polar and does not bond well to
the polar surface of the pipe. A complex system of primers and adhesives
must be applied to the pipe to achieve good adhesion. This is very
difficult to do on a pipe laying ship.Secondly, for the application of primers, adhesives and infill the
pipe needs to be heated to at least about 180Â°C prior to coating. This is fire
hazard and also exposes operatives to the risk of serious burns.Thirdly to achieve good bonding between the infill and the
polyolefin abutting the cutback the polyolefin faces of the cutback must be
molten and infill must take place before solidification. Synchronisation of
the steps is difficult.Fourthly the apparatus is expensive and bulky. The invention seeks to reduce at least some of these difficulties.According to the invention there is provided a method of filling a
cut-back of a metal pipe having a polyolefin coating the cut-back
comprising a gap in the pipe coating between coated portions the method
comprising the steps of:
i. creating a high surface energy layer on the polyolefin portion
of the cut-back by flame
