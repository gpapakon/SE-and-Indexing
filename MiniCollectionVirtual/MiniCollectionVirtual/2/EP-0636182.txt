<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIBODIES FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS INFECTIONField of the Invention This invention relates generally to the field of monoclonal, and recombinant, humanized antibodies, and specifically, to antibodies directed to epitopes on Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Background of the Invention Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a pneumovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae and is the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and calves during the first year of life [Kim et al . , Amer. J. EpidemJQl. .21:216-225 (1973); Stott et al . , . Hygiene. Â£5:257-270 (1980); Mclntosh and Chanock, in B. N. Fields et al . (eds), virology. Raven Press, New York (1990)]- Human and bovine strains of RSV are antigenically distinct, but closely related, and two subgroups (A and B) of both human and bovine strains have been identified [Lerch et al . , *!__. Virol., ___.:833-840 (1989); Anderson et al . , J. Tnfsnt.. Pis.. 151:626-633 (1985)].The use of anti-RSV antibodies for treatment of RSV in murine and bovine species has been suggested. However, the treatment of non-murine or non-bovine species is potentially limited by the immune response of these species to the foreign murine or bovine antibodies. For example, immune responses in humans against murine antibodies have been shown to both immunoglobulin constant and variable regions. There remains a need in the art to identify specifically the protective epitopes on RSV proteins and the immune effector mechanisms that protect against infection, and to produce and characterize RSV antigens, epitopes and antibodies thereto for use in safe, effective RSV vaccines. Summary of the Invention 

 The present invention provides a variety of anti-RSV antibodies, functional fragments thereof including CDRs.These antibodies and fragments are useful in the construction of fusion proteins, particularly chimeric and humanized antibodies, which are characterized by the binding specificity and/or neutralizing activity of an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody (mAb) . Also provided is a novel humanized antibody containing bovine antibody variable sequences in association with human immunoglobulin framework and constant regions. Methods for producing these products, which further include therapeutic and pharmaceutical compositions for treating RSV are also disclosed.Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described in the following detailed description.
