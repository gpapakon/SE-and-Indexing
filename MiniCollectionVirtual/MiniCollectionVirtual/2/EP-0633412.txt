<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an actuating device for a sliding sleeve in a motor vehicle gear box. The device comprises a selector rod (12) which can be displaced along its axis (14) and on which a shift fork (11) and a driver (13) are rigidly arranged. The fixing device (10) is designed as a plastic/metal composite component in which a metal part (25) which forms the driver (13) and a core for the selector rod (12) is embedded in an injection-moulded plastic (24) and the selector rod (11) is composed exclusively of the plastic (24).

An actuator for a gearshift sleeve (16) in a stepped motor 
vehicle gearbox, comprising a gearshift rod (12) being 

displaceable along its axis (14), and having a gearshift 
fork (11) as well as an engaging piece (13) rigidly attached 

thereto, characterized in that the actuator (10) is 
configured as a composite structure made from plastic 

material and metal, the composite structure having a 
metallic component (25) constituting the engaging piece 

(13) as well as a core for the gearshift rod (12), and 
being embedded in plastic material by injection molding, 

the composite structure, further, comprising the gearshift 
fork (11) consisting exclusively from the plastic material. 
The actuator of claim 1, characterized in that the plastic 
material (24) is polyamide. 
The actuator of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 

plastic material (24) is glass fiber reinforced. 
The actuator of any of claims 1 - 3, characterized in that 
those sections of the metallic component (25) forming the 

core of the gearshift rod (12) are configured as a flat 
rectangular-profile material. 
The actuator of claim 4, characterized in that the sections 
are provided with an undulating edge profile (30). 
The actuator of any of claims 1 - 5, characterized in that 
the gearshift rod (12) is configured at an enlarged axial 

section of the gearshift fork.  
 
The actuator of claim 6, characterized in that the enlarged 
section is configured by a plurality of radial ribs (40) . 
The actuator of any of claims 1 - 7, characterized in that 
the gearshift fork (11) is configured with a honeycomb 

structure having a plurality of chambers (45, 46, 47, 48) 
separated from one another by partition walls (48, 50, 

51). 
The actuator of claim 8, characterized in that the honeycomb 
structure, when viewed in a radial direction from the 

gearshift rod axis (12), first becomes wider in cross-section 
and then tapers down again. 
The actuator of claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the 
gearshift fork (11) has a circular segment shoulder (60), 

known per se, for engagement with the gearshift sleeve 
(16), the shoulder (60) being at least partially supported 

by the honeycomb structure. 
The actuator of claim 10, characterized in that the 
honeycomb structure in an axial direction comprises a 

maximum of two chambers (45, 46) each, separated by a 
partition wall (48), the shoulder (60) being radially 

aligned with the partition wall (48). 
The actuator of claim 10 or 11, characterized in that the 
shoulder (60) is supported along a portion of its periphery 

by a chamber (49) extending substantially radially. 
The actuator of any of claims 8 - 12, characterized in 
that all partition walls (48, 50, 51) have the same 

thickness (d).
