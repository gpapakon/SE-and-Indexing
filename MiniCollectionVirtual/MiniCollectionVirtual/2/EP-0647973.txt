<ABSTRACT>
A first hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode is obtained 
by applying a hydrogen-absorbing alloy powder on a collector 

or having a collector filled with a hydrogen-absorbing alloy 
powder and then sintering the hydrogen-absorbing alloy 

powder. The hydrogen-absorbing alloy powder is pre-pared by 
centrifugal spraying or gas atomizing and particles constituting 

the powder have a spherical shape, a nearly spherical 
shape, an egg-like shape or a mixed shape including the 

foregoing. The hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode can 
readily be produced at low cost and have high packing 

density and good corrosion resistance, and can hence yield, 
when used for negative electrodes, metal hydride secondary 

batteries having excellent cycle characteristics. A second 

hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode comprises a mixed powder 
containing a spherical-particle powder of a hydrogen-absorbing 

alloy and a powder as pulverized of the same alloy 
in a specific ratio. This electrode has high packing 

density and electronic conductivity, and can therefore gives 
batteries having excellent discharge characteristics on both 

high-rate discharge and low-rate discharge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent
Application Nos. 5-276166 filed on October 6, 1993 and 5-352524
filed on December 29, 1993.The present invention relates to a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy electrode used as a negative electrode for metal
hydride alkali secondary batteries and to a process for
producing the same.Hydrogen-absorbing alloys capable of absorbing and
discharging hydrogen have been developed actively in recent
years. Metal hydride alkaline secondary batteries utilizing
these hydrogen-absorbing alloys as negative electrode
materials have been attracting much attention and expected
to become a mainstream in the next generation, since they
are lighter and can be provided with higher capacity as
compared to lead, nickel-cadmium and like conventional
secondary batteries.Metal hydride alkaline secondary batteries are
generally produced by a process which comprises the steps of
pulverizing a block-like hydrogen-absorbing alloy into a
powder, mixing the hydrogen-absorbing alloy powder with a 
binder and other ingredients to obtain a paste, applying the
paste on a collector or having a collector be filled with
the paste and solidifying the paste by heat drying.However, the above process has the following problems
due to, firstly, the presence of a binder in the obtained
electrode and, secondly, the hydrogen-absorbing alloy powder
being produced by casting and pulverization.1 ○ The presence of a binder on the surface of hydrogen-absorbing
alloy particles obstructs formation of 3-phase
interfaces between the gas (oxygen), liquid (electrolyte)
and solid (hydrogen-absorbing alloy particles), thereby
preventing the water formation reaction consuming
oxygen from proceeding smoothly. As a result, the inside
pressure of the battery increases and the electrolyte is
eventually discharged together with oxygen outwardly from
the battery, so that the battery has poor cycle characteristics.
Besides, it becomes necessary to charge with a small
current and hence the battery has poor rapid chargeability.2 ○ The presence of a binder between particles of a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy decreases the electronic conductivity
between the particles, thereby decreasing the degree of
activation of the electrode.3 ○ It is necessary to decrease the amount of a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy to fill up the electrode by the volume
occupied by the binder, resulting in a low packing density.1 ○ Casting and pulverization requires a long time to cool a
hydrogen-absorbing alloy melt, whereby the same elements
contained therein
