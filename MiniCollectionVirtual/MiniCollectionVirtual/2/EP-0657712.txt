<ABSTRACT>
A sheet thickness sensing apparatus adapted to sense 
vibrations in thickness of sheet materials or documents 

such as printouts, invoices, and direct mails irrespective 
of dimensions of each document. The thickness sensing 

apparatus includes a main body, a sensor unit, a sheet light 
source, a photosensor, a douser or a light intercepting 

member, a crank, a motor, and a conveyor table. The main 
body is so supported on a slide rod as to move in one 

direction. The slide rod is in turn supported by support 
plates so as to move in a direction perpendicular to the 

direction of the main body. The sheet thickness of each 
document is optically and mechanically sensed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet thickness sensor,
and more particularly to a device or an apparatus for
sensing a thickness of articles as conveyed or fed over
a conveyor path or the like.Recently, a large amount of sealed documents such as
direct mail, debit notes and the like are conveyed or mailed
from businesses to customers by mail and the like. It is
required to check such documents, with respect to weight
and/or thickness.It is generally practiced to mail a large number
of documents such a printouts, invoices, and direct mails
in the same format to addressees. As illustration of
mail processing, the example of inserting and sealing the
invoices into each envelope may be explained as follows.Usually, debit notes in the form of a continuous
sheet containing the address and required information with
each document being cut and folded to a predetermined size
and placed in an envelope together with necessary enclosures
by utilizing a mail forming apparatus. Such a process is
effected automatically. To minimize errors in forming the
envelopes, there has been utilized a thickness detecting
device for measuring the thickness of each of the envelopes
being conveyed on a transporting passage.However, prior art thickness detecting devices are
not satisfactory in terms of reliability and applicability.An object of the invention is to provide a thickness
detecting device which can accurately detect the thickness
of an article being conveyed on a transporting passage at
a desired location.An object of the invention is to overcome the above
mentioned problems in the prior art device.This goal is achieved by an apparatus including the
features of independent claim 1. A coordinate measuring machine including a
thickness detecting device comprising a thickness detecting
portion for detecting the thickness of an article
and means for adjusting the position of the
thickness detecting portion relative to a plane on
which the article being
detected is mounted, so that the thickness at a desired
location of the article can be detected, is known e.g. from
US-A-4 442 607.Further objects and advantages of the invention will
become apparent from the following descriptions in
conjunction with attached drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a sensor unit
embodying the present invention;Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of a sensor
rod shown in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a schematic plan view explanatory of the
manner in which the envelope would be susceptible to
deformation under the process; andFig. 4 is a flow chart
