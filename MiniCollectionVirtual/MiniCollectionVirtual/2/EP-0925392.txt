 METHOD OF DISPOSAL OF HOT WATER SOLUBLE GARMENTS AND LIKE FABRICSRelated ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 08/286,814 filed on August 5, 1 994 which is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 08/055,083 filed on April 29, 1 993.Field of InventionThe present invention deals with specific products, namely, towels, sponges and gauzes which are produced from selectively hot water soluble polyvinyl alcohol resins. The resins are configured into fibers which are, in turn, used to construct the subject finished products.Background of the InventionHospital patient care generates considerable quantities of infectious medical waste in primary and acute care facilities. There has been a general conversion from reusable, cleanable items to disposable items over the last three decades.These conversions were made to promote antiseptic techniques in patient care and to decrease the potential for cross-infections between patients, staff and the general public. Recent federal and state government regulations such as the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1 988 and OSHA Medical Facility ruies have resulted in a substantial increase in medical waste that must be classified as"infectious."When a patient is admitted to the hospital, the patient produces approximately 55 pounds of medical waste per day. Approximately 20% of this waste is infectious. The current stated objective of the American HospitalAssociation and the Centers for Disease Control is to treat medical waste as soon as it is generated. Both organizations recognize that medical waste is primarily an 

occupational hazard for health care workers and not an environmental problem. The best way to handle infectious medical waste is to disinfect it at the point of generation and dispose of the treated medical waste with a minimum on premises handling and storage. The need for an effective way to dispose of medical waste has been highlighted by the amendment made to 29 CFR 1 910.1030 which provides for the federal regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 USC 655, 657 to control blood borne pathogens. Specifically, the Act calls for the establishment of an exposure control plan, the containment of specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials and the general tightening of precautionary measures to minimize the spread of disease. A safe and effective way to dispose of hospital waste would greatly facilitate compliance with the above-referenced Act.As a result, consumption

I claim:
1 An article comprising a member selected from the group consisting essentially of a towel, sponge and gauze, said article being comprised of fibers of polyvinyl alcohol resin which are selectively soluble in aqueous solutions only above approximately 37°C, said polyvinyl alcohol fibers being further characterized as having a degree of hydrolysis of at least approximately 80%, and average degree of polymerization between approximately 1300 to 2000, degree of crystallinity of at least 0.20 and a degree of orientation of at least 0.20.
2. The article of claim 1 wherein water solubility temperature for the polyvinyl alcohol fibers is greater than approximately 50°C.
3. The article of claim 1 wherein the water solubility temperature is greater than approximately 70°C.
4. The article of claim 3 wherein said polyvinyl alcohol fibers are produced by dope extrusion.
5. The article of claim 3 wherein the polyvinyl alcohol fibers are produced by melt spinning or hydrogel spinning followed by heat and stretching.
6. The article of claim 1 wherein the polyvinyl alcohol fibers have a water content of between approximately 1 .5 to 1 5% by weight. 

7. The article of claim 1 wherein said polyvinyl alcohol fibers further contain an anti-blocking agent in an amount between approximately 0.1 to 5.0% by weight.
8. The article of claim 7 wherein the anti-blocking agent is a member selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, talc, calcium carbonate, and fumed hydrophilic silicon dioxide.
9. The article of claim 1 wherein said polyvinyl alcohol fibers further include between approximately 0.1 to 2.0% by weight of a wetting agent.
10. The article of claim 1 which is produced by fibers of polyvinyl alcohol in the form of spun yarn, thermally bonded, chemically bonded, needle punched, wet laid, or air laid.
1 1 . The article of claim 1 further comprising an anti-static agent.
1 2. The article of claim 1 further comprising a cohesion agent.
1 3. The article of claim 1 further comprising an anti-friction lubricant.
14. The article of claim 1 wherein said polyvinyl alcohol fibers are selectively hot water soluble only at temperatures of at least 90°C wherein said polyvinyl alcohol is provided with a degree of hydrolysis of at least approximately 98%. 


 \5 An article comprising a member selected from the group consisting essentially of a towel, sponge and gauze, said towel being comprised of fibers of polyvinyl alcohol resin which are selectively soluble in aqueous solutions only above approximately 37°C, said polyvinyl alcohol being further characterized as being crystallized having been produced by dope extrusion followed by heating and stretching having a degree of hydrolysis of at least 98% and a degree of polymerization between approximately 1 300 to 2000.
ΛjB. A method of disposing of an article comprising a member selected from the group consisting essentially of a towel, sponge and gauze, said towel being comprised of fibers of polyvinyl alcohol resin which are selectively soluble in aqueous solutions only above approximately 37°C, said polyvinyl alcohol fibers being further characterized as having a degree of hydrolysis of greater than approximately 80%, degree of polymerization between approximately 300 to 3000, a degree of crystallinity of at least 0.20 and a degree of orientation of at least 0.20, said method comprises contacting the towel, sponge or gauze with water having a temperature above 37°C for a period of time sufficient to dissolve the towel, sponge or gauze in the water.
