<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic compositions
comprising polysiloxane-polycarbonate block copolymers and
high heat polycarbonates. These polymer compositions
exhibit improved low temperature ductility, improved thick
section impact strength, improved resistance to cracking on
thermal cycling and improved retention of impact after
thermal cycling. The polymer compositions are especially
useful as engineering thermoplastics.Phenolphthalein, as a dihydric phenol reactant, has
been used to prepare high heat polycarbonate resins; see
for example the disclosures in U.S. Patents 3,036,036;
3,036,037; 3,036,039; 4,078,999; 4,167,536; and 4,310,652.
Phenolphthalein has also been used as a reactant in
admixture with bisphenol-A to prepare copolycarbonate
resins; see for example Lin, M.S. and E. M. Pearce,
Polymers With Improved Flammability Characteristics, II:
Phenolphthalein Related Copolycarbonates, Journal of
Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition, (1981) 19: p.
2151-2160. Poly(ester-carbonates) prepared with
phenolphthalein reactant are also known; see U.S. Patent
4,310,652. The phenolphthalein copolycarbonates exhibit
good room temperature ductility and high heat-distortion
temperatures.Certain derivatives of phenolphthalein have also been
used as dihydric phenols to prepare polycarbonate resins.
For example, Lin and Pearce, I: Pgs. 2151-2160, supra.,
describe preparation of polycarbonate homopolymer resins
wherein 3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)phthalimidine and 2-phenyl-3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)
phthalimidine were separately
polymerized (phosgenated).Copending European application No. 94301946.3 (EP-A 617070), discloses
selected phenolphthalimidine homo and copolycarbonates that have
better UV stability than phenolphthalein copolycarbonates. These
phenolphthalimidine homo and copolycarbonates also have 
good room temperature ductility, high heat distortion
temperatures and are free from the objectionable coloration
associated with the above mentioned phenolphthalein
monomer.These phenolphthalein and phenolphthalimidine homo and
copolycarbonates have several disadvantages that limit
their usefulness. Particularly the phenolphthalein and
phenolphthalimide polycarbonates have poor low temperature
ductility and parts molded from these polycarbonates crack
on thermal cycling.Condensation copolymers having polysiloxane and
polycarbonate blocks are known. Representative of such
polymers are those disclosed by Schmidt et al., U. S. Pat.
