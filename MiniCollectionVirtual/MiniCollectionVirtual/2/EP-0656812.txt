<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalyst and a method for its manufacture. The catalyst is made of at least two metal foil strips (1, 2), transverse corrugations having been formed in at least one of them. The metal foil strips are formed into a honeycomb (4) containing channels (3). The strips are coated with a support or with supports, and at least one catalytically active agent such as a noble metal is added to the coated strips in order to produce a catalytic surface. In this case the catalytic surface has the physical structure derived from the coating. The honeycomb (4) has at least two catalytic surfaces (5, 6) differing from each other with respect to at least the support or the physical structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst and a method for
its manufacture, as set forth in the claims.For treating gases, and in particular for purifying the polluting
exhaust gases of combustion engines, there have been used
various catalytic surfaces, mainly depending on the composition
of the exhaust gases and the structure of the catalyst. The
polluting components of exhaust gases are substantially composed
of unburnt hydrocarbons, cracked hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. The purpose of the catalyst is
to cause the hydrocarbons and the carbon monoxide to oxidize,
i.e. to burn as completely as possible to carbon dioxide and
water, and the oxides of nitrogen to become reduced to elemental
nitrogen. Exhaust gas often also contains small amounts of
sulfur dioxide derived from the sulfur present in the fuel, the
sulfur burning in the engine to sulfur dioxide.The basic structure of a catalyst comprises a frame material,
i.e. a carrier, which may be ceramic or a metal foil strip; a
support layer, i.e. a so-called washcoat; and noble metals used
as active agents. A ceramic frame is usually made up of one or
two successively placed monolithic pieces or honeycombs, which
have channels or conduits, separated from each other by thin
walls and longitudinal relative to the gas flow direction. A 
honeycomb made of a metal foil strip is made either by winding
or by stacking, in which case, after tight packing of the
strips, the corrugations transverse to the strip, in at least
in a portion of the strip, form channels or conduits in the gas
flow direction. Typically a honeycomb is made up of a flat
strip and a corrugated strip placed alternately.When the purification of the exhaust gases of a gasoline engine
is concerned, gamma aluminum oxide is commonly used as the support.
In catalysts used for purifying exhaust gases of other
types of engines, for example diesel engines and natural gas
engines, it is also possible to use, for example, silica, i.e.
silicon dioxide, and titania, i.e. titanium dioxide. Zeolites
are also commonly used as supports in catalysts. The purpose of
the support is to form a sufficiently large surface area for
the catalytic agents such as noble metals, and often also to
participate in the catalytic reactions. Depending on the
support, such support properties having an effect on reactions
may include an ability to bind sulfur dioxide gas or oxygen.
The physical structure of the catalytic surface means, for
example, the thickness of the support, the layered structure of
the
