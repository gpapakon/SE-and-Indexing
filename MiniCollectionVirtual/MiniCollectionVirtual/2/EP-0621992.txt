<DESCRIPTION>
 Feed-back circuit for CMOS high voltage generator to program (E)EPROM-memory cells.The invention relates to a high voltage feed-back circuit for a high voltage generator comprising several voltage multiplying stages connected in series, wherein an oscillator generates at least two clock pulses being 180° out of phase to one another, con¬ trolling alternately successive voltage multiplying stages to pro¬ vide a high voltage pulse at the output of the high voltage gener- ator, the high voltage output being connected to the high voltage feed-back circuit comprising a capacitive input stage and gener¬ ating a control signal supplied to the oscillator, so that the oscillator output is modified in dependence on the high voltage output voltage, said capacitive input stage comprising at least a first capacitor receiving at one terminal the high voltage output and its other terminal being connected to one terminal of a second capacitor.Such a high voltage feed-back circuit is known from EP-A- 0.323.156. Said known feed-back circuit is applied to a high volt- age generator comprising a series connection of voltage multipliers being alternately controlled by clock signals Φ and ϊ. The output voltage of this high voltage generator is capacitively measured and compared with a reference voltage by a comparator. The output sig¬ nal of the comparator is supplied to a ring oscillator generating the clock signals Φ and ϊ. When the measured high voltage exceeds a certain threshold level the output of the comparator becomes low and as a consequence the ring oscillator stops oscillating and, therefore, the generation of clock pulses is stopped. When the high voltage level decreases below said threshold level the output of the comparator becomes high restarting the ring oscillator and the generation of clock pulses.The high voltage feed-back circuit as known shows many dis¬ advantages, the most important being discontinuities in the deriva¬ tive of the high voltage output of the high voltage generator to which the feed-back circuit is applied. This is caused by the application of the comparator in the feed-back circuit, the output of the comparator being only capable of starting or stopping the ring oscillator and, therefore, the multiplying stages in the high 

 voltage generator suffer from sudden stops or starts in the receipt of controlling clock pulses. Such discontinuities in the derivative of the high voltage output reduces the lifetime of EEPROM cells. Moreover, the comparator in the known feed-back circuit must be
