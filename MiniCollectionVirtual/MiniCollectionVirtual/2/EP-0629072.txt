<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement in a 
telephone system for controlling debiting of services. 

The arrangement comprises a telephone set (1) for each 
subscriber and call-debiting equipment (4) arranged in a 

respective telephone exchange (3) from which different 
services can be ordered. According to the invention, the 

call-debiting equipment (4) is arranged to receive 
control signals from the telephone set for controlling 

the utilization of ordered services in dependence on the 
cost debited therefor. The telephone set (1) comprises 

elements (2) for taking codes which constitute control 
signals to the call-debiting equipment. The code-taking 

elements are preferably constituted by the conventional 
keypad of the telephone set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement 
in a telephone system for controlling debiting of services. 
The invention allows the subscriber to maximize 
his costs and to bar certain services which can be 
ordered from the telecommunications office. By taking 
codes on his telephone set, the subscriber can control 
the call-debiting equipment and which services can be 
ordered. It is already known to control the costs in a 
telephone system. US 5,109,401 describes a device for controlling 
call costs. The technique described relates to radio 
telecommunications. The device can inform the user if the 
cost for a call exceeds a predetermined cost. The call 
can be stopped in the case of this cost being exceeded. 
The user can also be informed if the accumulated costs 
exceed a predetermined cost. Here, too, the communication 
can be barred if this cost is exceeded. US 5,138,650 relates to a method for the utilization 
of a wireless telephone. The subscribers communicate 
via base stations connected to a public telephone 
network. A network control unit is connected to a debiting 
block. A subscriber is allowed a credit for making a 
call possible and can be warned if the credit comes to an 
end so that he has the possibility of buying more credit. The present invention solves the problem of 
directly controlling the costs in the telephone system 
via a conventional telephone set. By taking codes via the 
keypad of the telephone set, the costs for a particular 
time period or for a certain service can be maximized and 
services can be barred permanently or temporarily with  
 
the aid of further code-taking. The present invention thus provides an arrangement 
in a telephone system for controlling debiting of 
services. The arrangement comprises telephone sets for 
each subscriber and call-debiting equipment arranged in 
a respective telephone exchange from which different 
services can be ordered. According to the invention, the 
call-debiting equipment is arranged to receive control 
signals from the telephone set for controlling the 
utilization of ordered services in dependence on the cost 
debited therefor. The telephone set comprises elements for taking 
codes which constitute control signals to the call-debiting 
equipment. The code-taking elements are preferably 
constituted by the conventional keypad of the 
telephone set. The invention is specified in greater detail in 
the patent claims which follow. The invention will now be described in detail 
with reference to the attached drawings, in
