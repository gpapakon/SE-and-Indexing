<DESCRIPTION>
In many applications, it is desirable to detect the
presence of one or more molecular structures in a sample.
The molecular structures typically comprise ligands, such
as, cells, antibodies and anti-antibodies. Ligands are
molecules which are recognized by a particular receptor.
Ligands may include, without limitation, agonists and
antagonists for cell membrane receptors, toxins, venoms,
oligo-saccharides, proteins, bacteria, and monoclonal
antibodies. For example, a DNA or RNA sequence analysis
is very useful in genetic and disease diagnosis,
toxicology testing, genetic research, agriculture and
pharmaceutical development. Likewise, cell and antibody
detection is important in disease diagnosis.A number of techniques have been developed for
molecular structure detection. In DNA and RNA sequence
detection, two procedures are generally used,
autoradiography and optical detection. Autoradiography is
performed using 32P or 35S. For DNA sequence analysis
applications, nucleic acid fragments are end labeled with
32P. These end labeled fragments are separated by size,
then exposed to x-ray film for a specified amount of time.
The amount of film exposure is directly related to the
amount of radioactivity adjacent to a region of film.The use of any radioactive label is associated with
several disadvantages. First, prolonged exposure to
radioactive elements increases the risk of acquiring
genetic diseases, such as cancer. As such, precautions 
must be implemented when using radioactive markers or
labels to reduce the exposure to radioactivity.
Typically, workers must wear a device to continually
monitor radioactive exposure. In addition, pregnant
females should take additional precautions to prevent
the occurrence of genetic mutations in the unborn.The conventional radioactive detection scheme has
sensitivity limitations in both the temporal and spatial
domains. The use of radioactive labelling currently has
a spatial resolution of one millimeter. Additional
hardware and software are required to reduce the spatial
resolution below one millimeter.The sensitivity of detection utilizing
autoradiographic film is directly related to the amount
of time during which the radioactive labelled fragments
are exposed to the film. Thus, the exposure time of the
film may range from hours to days, depending upon the
level of radioactivity within each detection test site.
A β scanner may drastically reduce the time required for
film exposure during radiography. However, the use of
the β scanner significantly increases the

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a circuit for identifying molecular structures comprising
forming an electrically addressable array of test well sites including electrodes for

applying an electrical potential to the wells, reactants being attracted to selected sites
by applying a potential to selected electrodes to form probes therein, capable of

bonding with a unique molecular structure and wherein the probes in each test site
differ from the probes in other test sites. 
The method of claim 1 wherein
forming said array comprises the steps of:


a) forming a first layer on a substrate;
b) forming a second layer on the first layer;
c) forming openings in the second layer into the first layer exposing a
portion of the first layer; and
d) forming a pair of electrodes in the openings and wherein said test
signal is applied to the electrodes.
The method of claim 2 wherein forming said pair of electrodes comprises the
steps of depositing metallization on the second layer after the openings are formed;
