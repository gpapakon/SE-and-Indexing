<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns elastomeric films and more 
specifically concerns an improved elastomeric laminate. Elastomeric films have for some time been used and 
discussed in the literature with regard to their 
applications in disposable products, such as baby 
diapers and adult incontinent devices. These 
elastomeric webs or films are used primarily in the 
body hugging portions of garments. Many of these 
elastics are temperature-treated to provide for 
controlled elastic recovery. In diapers, for example, 
elastomeric bands are typically used in the waistband 
portions such as discussed in US-A-4,681,580 and 
US-A-4,710,189. 
Both of these patents describe the use of 
elastomeric materials which have a heat stable and a 
heat unstable form. The heat unstable form is created 
by stretching the material when heated around its 
crystalline or second phase transition temperature 
followed by a rapid quenching to freeze in the heat 
unstable extended form. The heat unstable elastomeric 
film can then be applied to the, e.g., diaper and then 
heated to its heat stable elastomeric form. US-A-3,694,815 proposes a method for 
attaching a stretched relaxed elastic ribbon to a 
garment by stretching conventional elastic ribbons and 
immediately freezing the elastomeric material at 
relatively extreme low temperatures (e.g., well below 
ambient). GB-A-2190406 proposed maintaining 
a conventional elastomer in a stretched condition,  
 
while attaching it to the member to be shirred (e.g., a 
diaper), by a rigidifying member, which would then be 
removed or destroyed following the attachment 
procedure. As described, the elastomers are first 
stretched then applied to the rigidifying member in its 
stretched form. GB-A-2,160,473, proposes an 
elastomer which will shrink at an elevated temperature 
(e.g., at or above 175°F or 79.4°C). The allegedly 
novel feature of this material, compared to the heat 
shrink materials discussed above, is that it does not 
require preheating or cold treatment during the 
stretching operation but rather could be stretched at 
ambient temperatures by a differential speed roll 
process or by "cold rolling". The polymer proposed was 
a copolymer having alternating segments of 
polyamidepolyether block polymers, commercially 
available under the trade name Pebax, particularly 
Pebax Extrusion grades 2533 and 3533. Problems with these elastomeric films include the 
difficulties inherent in applying a stretched elastic 
film to a flexible substrate such as a disposable 
diaper. For example,
