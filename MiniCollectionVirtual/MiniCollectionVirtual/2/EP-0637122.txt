<ABSTRACT>
In order to effectively reduce consumer's electrical 
power consumption, an input voltage of a step-down 

autotransformer (2) is detected by a switch controller (4). 
Subsequently, the switch controller (4) compares the detected 

input voltage (VRN) with at least one reference voltage and 
generates at least one comparison result. Based on the 

comparison result, the switch controller (4) controls at 
least one switch, which is operatively coupled to a 

secondary winding of the autotransformer (2), such as to 
change the step-down ratio of the autotransformer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
apparatus and method of effectively adjusting a step-down 
ratio of an autotransformer in response to an input 
voltage applied thereto, and more specifically to such an 
apparatus and method by which electric power costs paid 
by consumers can effectively be reduced by preventing the 
autotransformer from supplying loads thereof with 
unnecessarily high voltages. It is highly desirable to reduce consumers' electric 
power consumption in view of effective usage of finite 
resources on the earth and also environmental 
preservation. Furthermore, it is both practically and 
economically attractive to achieve effective reduction of 
consumers' electricity consumption if such reduction does 
not induce malfunction in consumers' appliances. Small or medium sized power consumers, such as 
super-markets, convenience stores, business offices and 
usual homes, directly apply ac (alternate current) 
voltage, supplied from an electric power company, to 
their electric appliances. In such an instance, power 
saving is achieved using the unsophisticated technique of 
diligently turning off various appliances when their use 
is not essential. It is known that a nominal voltage supplied to a 
consumer's electric appliance can vary over an operation 
range within which a manufacture guaranties its 
operation. Therefore, an alterative way to implement the 
power saving is to step down, by a predetermined value,  
 
the input ac voltage which is applied to the consumers' 
appliances. However, if an ac input voltage is 
abnormally lowered even temporarily due to unexpected 
disturbance, it is no longer possible to assure correct 
operations of the appliances. It is therefore essential, in the event that the 
above type of voltage reduction is used for power saving, 
that the appliances be protected from malfunction due to 
unexpected low voltages. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an apparatus for detecting an input voltage and 
automatically controlling a step-down ratio of an 
autotransformer in response to the voltage detection. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a method of detecting an input voltage and 
automatically controlling a step-down ratio of an 
autotransformer in accordance with the voltage detection. In brief, the above objects are achieved by an 
improved technique wherein in order to effectively reduce 
consumer's electrical power consumption, an input voltage 
of a step-down autotransformer is detected by a switch
