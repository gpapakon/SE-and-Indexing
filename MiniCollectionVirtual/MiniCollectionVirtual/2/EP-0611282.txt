<ABSTRACT>
A three-sided toothbrush having brush heads (11, 14, 16) that adjust independently to maintain contact with the gums and the surfaces of the teeth. The three brush heads (11, 14, 16) are independently attached to a single handle (10) through elongated flexible arms (19, 22, 26) and adjust independently to maintain contact with the surfaces of different size teeth. During use, the bristles (12) of one brush head (11) are in contact with the ends of the teeth and the bristles (17, 18) of the other two brush heads (14, 16) are in contact with the inside and outside surfaces of the teeth. Bristles (17, 18) attached to side brush heads (14, 16) are cut so that shorter, firmer bristles came in contact with the inside and outside surfaces of the teeth while longer, softer bristles came in contact with the gums. The toothbrush may be manufactured using standard toothbrush manufacturing techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a self-adjusting three-sided toothbrush for
simultaneously brushing the sides and ends of the teeth and portions of the gums,
and more particularly to a toothbrush that has three brushes independently
mounted to a handle which independently adjust to accommodate various tooth
sizes and configurations and which effectively clean the teeth and sulcular pockets
and massage the gums. This invention also relates to a method for manufacturing
such three-sided brushes. A number of prior art patents have recognized the desirability of cleaning
simultaneously the sides and ends of the teeth. U. S. Patent No. 2,588,601 issued
to Zavagno on March 11, 1952 entitled "Spring Pressed Toothbrush" discloses a
toothbrush having bristles fixed conventionally to a handle for brushing the tops
or bottoms of a tooth and including a plurality of U-shaped wire members
extending through the end of the handle having a pair of brushes fixed to either
end of the wire members for brushing the sides of the teeth. The wires are
provided to allow for flexure, but may come in contact with parts of the mouth
causing an uncomfortable feeling or even injury. Further, the amount of
adjustabitity is limited due to the elastic limit of the springs working over such a
short distance.U. S. Patent No. 2,214,407 issued to Deutsch on September 10, 1940
entitled "Toothbrush with Brush-Head Made in Three Parts" discloses a
toothbrush having three brush beads with bristles for brushing three sides of the
tooth. The bristles on the sides are inclined upwardly. Similarly, U.S. Patent No.
2,093,383 issued to Rudof et al. on September 14, 1937 and entitled "Tooth Brush"
discloses a toothbrush with a U-shaped head having bristles on each side thereof
for simultaneously brushing all sides of the tooth. The side bristles of Rudof are
inclined downwardly towards the end bristles. Also, U.S. Patent No. 2,701,380
issued to Ripper, on February 8, 1955 and entitled "Attachment for Toothbrushes"
discloses a U-shaped attachment which could be mounted to a conventional
toothbrush to allow the toothbrush to clean the top and sides of the teeth
simultaneously.U.S. Patent No. 2,807,820 issued to Dinhofer on October 1, 1957 and
entitled "Flexible Brush Head and Means to Retain it in a Predetermined
Position" discloses a flexible brush head having inclined bristles which
simultaneously brush both sides of the upper teeth and the top side of the lower 
teeth, and vice versa. U.S. Patent No. 3,065,479 issued to McGee on November
27, 1962 and

<CLAIMS>
A self adjusting three-head toothbrush comprising:

(a) a handle (10) having a connecting end;
(b) a central brush head (11) having (i) a central brush
head portion having a plurality of recesses (41)

formed therein for receiving tufts of bristles (12),
(ii) tufts of bristles (12), each tuft having an

anchor fixed in the recesses (41) of the central brush
head portion and bristle ends lying in a plane

substantially parallel to the central brush head
portion, and (iii) an elongated arm (19) extending

longitudinally from said central brush head portion
and terminating in a connecting end (21);
(c) a first side brush head (14) having (i) a first side
brush enlarged head portion (23) having a plurality of

recesses (41) formed therein for receiving tufts of
bristles (17), (ii) tufts of bristles (17), each tuft

having on anchor fixed in the recesses (41) of the
first side brush enlarged head portion (23) and

bristle ends, and (iii) an elongated arm (22)
extending longitudinally from said first side brush

enlarged head portion (23) and terminating in a
connecting end (28);
(d) a second side brush head (16) having (i) a second side
brush enlarged head portion (27) having a plurality of

recesses (41) formed therein for receiving tufts of
bristles (18), (ii) tufts of bristles (18), each tuft

having an anchor fixed in the recesses (41) of the
second side brush enlarged head portion (27) and

bristle ends, and (iii) an elongated arm (26)
extending longitudinally from said second brush

enlarged head portion (27) and terminating in a
connecting end (28);

   wherein (i) said first side brush head (14) and said second
side brush head (16) are positioned on opposite sides of said

central brush head (11), (ii) said connected end (21) of the
elongated arm (19) of the central brush head (11) is integrally.

connected to the connecting end of the handle, (iii) said 
connecting end (28) of the elongated arm (22) of the first side

brush head (14) and said connecting end of the elongated arm (26)
of the second side brush head (16) each being independently

mounted to the connecting end of the handle on opposite sides of
the elongated arm (19) of the central brush head (11) so that the

first side brush head, the second side brush head and central
brush head each move independent of one another, (iv) the

elongated arms of the first side brush head and the second side
brush head and of the central brush head extend along the

longitudinal axis of the toothbrush and form a substantially U-shape,
said elongated arms of the first side brush head and the

second side brush head lying against the opposite sides of the
elongated arm of the central brush head, and (v) said bristle

ends of the first side brush head and said bristle ends of the
second side brush head lie in a plane substantially perpendicular

to the plane of the bristle ends of the central brush head.
A toothbrush in accordance with claim 1 wherein the first
side brush enlarged head portion (23) and the second side brush

enlarged head portion (27) are both positioned at a predetermined
angle with respect to the central brush head portion, said

predetermined angle being the acute angle between (i) a plane
perpendicular to the plane of the bristle ends of the central

brush head and (ii) a plane parallel to the respective first side
brush enlarged head portion or second side brush enlarged head

portion, wherein said predetermined angle is within the range of
15 to 40 degrees.
A toothbrush in accordance with claim 2 wherein the
predetermined angle is about 27 degrees.
A toothbrush in accordance with claim 1 wherein the tufts
of bristles (17, 18) in the first side brush head (14) and in the

second side brush head (16) are longer than the tufts of bristles
(12) in the central brush head (11). 
A toothbrush in accordance with claim 1 wherein the bristle

(14) and the bristle ends of the tufts of bristles (18) in the
second side brush head (16) face each other above the tufts of

bristles (12) of the central brush head (11).
A toothbrush in accordance with one of claims 1 to 5 wherein
the integral connection between the central brush head (11) and

the connecting end of the handle enables the central brush head
to move in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the bristle ends

of the central brush head, the independent connection between the
first side brush head (14) and the connecting end of the handle
