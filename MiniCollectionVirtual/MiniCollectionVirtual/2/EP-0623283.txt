<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an algae and moss removing 
agent in the form of a composed composition in order to free 
surfaces from algae and moss. The object of the present invention is to obtain a composition 
by means of which cleansing of surfaces from algae and moss can 
be done in an efficient and rational way. Growth of algae and moss on different surfaces has become a more 
and more an increasing problem lately, and has probably its 
origin in an increased acidity of the atmospheric precipitation. 
Growth of moss on certain roofs has increased very heavily and 
no other method than mechanical cleansing for longterm results 
has thereby not been found. The mechanical cleansing is, however, 
not working in the depth which means that the moss will 
soon be back again in full volume. The moss is also covering 
stone walls and pathways, as well as in grass lawns. Algae has 
also become a general scourge, growing on roofs, wind barge 
boards, walls, fences, palings, trees, stairways, stonewalls, 
and stone pathways, i.e. on most surfaces outdoors, and then 
particularly where the sun does not reach the surface to provide 
a high surface temperature, i.e. in shadow positions. On the market today, an algae cleansing agent is present based 
on tertiary ammonium compounds. This has, however, turned out to have little effect on moss, and 
moreover it has a limited longterm effect on algae. There is thus a considerable problem to be solved. It has now surpringly been shown possible to solve the above 
problem by means of the present invention, which is characterized  
 
in that the composition comprises calcium chloride, a 
straight or branched carboxylic acid having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, 
and hydrogen peroxide. Further characteristics will be evident form the accompanying 
claims. The carboxylic acid consists of acetic acid, n-propionic acid, 
isopropionic acid, butyric acid, iso-butyric acid, tert.-butyric 
acid, valeric acid, whereby propionic acid is preferred. By means of the present invention a rapid and effecient 
elimination of algae and moss, as well as a considerable 
longterm effect. The invention will now be described by way of the examples 
below. 600 liters of 5% n-propionic acid, 370 liters of 37% CaCl₂, and 
30 liters of 35% H₂O₂ were mixed together. and were provided 
with 1 g of bromothymol blue, as a coloring marker. This gives a basic solution which is diluted with equal volume 
of water before application, suitable by means of a spraying 
equipment. 2 liters of ready-to-use solution
