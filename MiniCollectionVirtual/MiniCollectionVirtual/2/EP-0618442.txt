<ABSTRACT>
A Raman spectroscopy system and method for determining a 
zero-calibration 

level. A gas sample chamber (54) is located within a resonant cavity. 
A light 

source (22) is located to cause light to be incident on the gas sample, 
the 

light resonates in the resonant cavity. Typically, the light source and 
resonator cavity in conjunction form a laser source which propagates 

coherent, monochromatic laser light energy through the gas sample. This 
causes Raman scattering from the gases constituent in the gas sample. The 

amount of Raman scattered light is measured at detectors (72) along 
with light 

due to dark noise inherent in the detectors and glow from the laser 
source, 

i.e., light at wavelengths other than the laser light wavelength 
produced 

by the laser source. The resonator cavity is obstructed, via a 

ball (380) 
inserted into the path of the laser beam for example, to prevent 

resonance. 
If the light source and resonant cavity in conjunction form a laser, 

prevention of resonance causes cessation of lasing. Thus, substantially 
no 

Raman scattering occurs and detectors measure light due primarily to 
background noise. The origin of the measurement scale for the detectors 

may then be set at the measured intensity, i.e., a zero-calibration 
level 

for the detectors may be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved spectroscopy system. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
zero-calibration in gas analysis systems. The invention is disclosed in 
the context of a Raman spectroscopy gas analysis system. When an incident photon collides with a polyatomic gas molecule, it may 
either be scattered elastically, i.e., without energy exchange, or 
inelastically, i.e., with energy exchange that excites or de-excites a 
rotational/vibrational mode of the molecule. If the incident photon 
collides with a gas molecule and excites the gas molecule to a higher 
vibrational/rotational energy mode, the photon is re-emitted at a lower 
energy and consequently lower frequency than the incident photon. This 
inelastic scattering is termed Stokes Raman scattering. Similarly, if the 
incident photon collides with a gas molecule and de-excites the gas 
molecule to a lower vibrational/rotational energy mode, the photon is 
re-emitted at a greater energy and consequently higher frequency than the 
incident photon. This type of inelastic scattering is termed anti-Stokes 
Raman scattering. Although both effects may be observed, at room 
temperatures the Stokes Raman effect is generally more intense and thus, 
easier to measure. Therefore, the light resulting from collisions 
according to the Stokes Raman effect is typically analyzed and will be 
discussed herein. Rotational/vibrational energy modes of molecules are quantized, forcing 
photons to exchange energy with molecules in discrete amounts. Different 
gas molecules require different amounts of energy from a photon to excite 
molecules to a higher rotational/vibrational mode. Thus, the amount of 
energy necessary to excite a gas molecule to a higher mode is 
characteristic of the type of molecule. The change in the photon's 
frequency caused by inelastic scattering corresponds to the amount of 
energy lost by the photon and can be used to identify the type of molecule 
which caused the scattering. Such analysis is called Raman spectroscopy.  Raman spectroscopy systems typically comprise a laser which directs 
intense, monochromatic light energy, toward a gas sample to be analyzed. 
Detectors, such as photo multiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes, are 
arranged about the gas sample to receive Raman scattered energy. Filters 
remove elastically scattered energy at the wavelength of the laser source. 
Additional filters, each filter being designed to pass a different 
wavelength of expected Raman
