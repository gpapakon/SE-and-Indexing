<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
rapid temperature rise heater element and a method for
preparing the same.Rapid temperature rise heater elements are disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) Nos. 28467/1989 and
61832/1992, for example. The rapid temperature rise heater
element disclosed in JP-B 28467/1989 constitutes a glow plug
for use in automotive Diesel engines. It is prepared by
charging a hot press mold with a source powder of silicon
carbide (SiC) having a well-known sintering aid (e.g., B4C and
Al2O3) added thereto, placing a linear body having a linear
heater section of a high-melting metal material mainly of
tungsten, molybdenum or the like on the source powder at a
predetermined position, further feeding the source powder
thereon to bury the linear body, and firing under pressure at 
about 2,000°C by a hot press method. Voltage is applied across
the exposed ends of the linear body to generate heat.The rapid temperature rise heater element disclosed in JP-B
61832/1992 is an electric resistor which is as a whole
constructed from 30 to 70% by volume of a nitride selected from
the group consisting of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride,
boron nitride, and mixtures thereof, 10 to 45% by volume of
silicon carbide, and 5 to 50% by volume of molybdenum
disilicide, has a density of at least 85% of the theoretical
density, and includes an exothermic zone and a non-exothermic
zone having different compositions. More particularly, a
material providing a high resistance upon sintering and another
material providing a low resistance upon sintering are formed
as two layers which are hot press fired. The sintered body is
machined in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the
layers to provide a U shape. Voltage is applied across the two
free legs of the U shape whereby heat is generated at the
connecting portion.The rapid temperature rise heater element of JP-B
28467/1989 is prepared by hot press firing the source ceramic
powder and the linear body such that the linear body serving as
a heater is buried in the ceramic compact. Then heater
elements must be manufactured one by one in a substantial
sense. The manufacturing process is less efficient and takes a
long time. This is also undesirable for cost. And the buried
heater is low in thermal efficacy as compared with a heater
exposed at the surface of a structure.Also the rapid temperature rise heater element of JP-B
61832/1992 is prepared by machining a sintered conductive body 
of two layers having different resistance values into a
predetermined
