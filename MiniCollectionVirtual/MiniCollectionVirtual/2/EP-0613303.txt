<ABSTRACT>
A transform unit (1) obtains a discrete cosine 
coefficient by processing an image signal in a discrete 

cosine transform fashion at the unit of a predetermined 
data amount. A memory (2) includes therein a plurality 

of quantization tables corresponding to quantization 
accuracies different from each other, and a memory (4) 

includes therein a variable length coding table. A 
quantization unit (5) quantizes the discrete cosine 

coefficient with reference to selected one of the 
pl
urality of quantization tables. An encoding unit (6) 
obtains encoded data by processing the quantized 

discrete cosine coefficient in a variable length coding 
fashion. A code amount adding unit (7) obtains total 

amount data indicative of a total amount of the encoded 
data corresponding to the predetermined data amount. 

The encoded data, the total amount data and table 
identification data corresponding to selected one of the 

plurality of quantization tables are temporarily stored 
in an FIFO memory (8) and these data are read out 

therefrom as a compression code in a predetermined 
order.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
signal compression apparatus for use in a recording and
transmitting apparatus for recording and transmitting an
image in the form of compressed data or the like. More
particularly, this invention relates to an image signal
compression apparatus suitable for recording and
reproducing a moving image of a moving image edit
apparatus in the compressed form in a real time.The standardization of an image compression
method has been made in recent image processing
apparatus. As the standardization of the image compression
method, a JPEG (Joint Picture Expert Group) system
(JPEG standard (JPEG-9-R7) is determined and utilized
(see special number "Understanding and Application of
Image data compression" of magazine "INTERFACE", Dec.
12, 1991, published by CQ publishing Inc., pp. 177, 180
and 204 - 208). Further, circuit elements (LSIs) (LSIs
manufactured by LSI Logic Corp., under the trade names
of L64765, L64735 and L64745 and LSI manufactured by
C-Cube Corp., under the trade name of CL550) in which
the JPEG can be applied to NTSC or PAL television moving
pictures in a real time fashion are now developed. On
the other hand, in the video edit field, it is customary
that the edit of image is carried out by using video 
tapes. Recently, an apparatus which can considerably
reduce an edit work time by recording a video signal
based on the JPEG in the form of compressed data and
instantly reproducing the recorded video signal randomly
receives a remarkable attention (see special number "How
Tapeless Edit system will be developed?" of a magazine
entitled "VIDEO Î±", Oct. 1991, published by Photographic
Industry Publishing Inc., pp. 27-32 and Educational
Report April 1992, "VIDEO AND STILL IMAGE COMPRESSION",
published by Knowledge Industry Publications Inc., pp.
S-16, S-25, S-27 and S-28).Encoding and decoding in the JPEG will be
described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 is a
block diagram showing an encoding unit of a conventional
compression apparatus based on the standard JPEG. FIG. 5
is a block diagram showing a decoding unit of such
conventional compression apparatus.As shown in FIG. 4, the encoding unit of the
conventional compression apparatus comprises a discrete
cosine unit (DCT unit) 101, a memory 102 for storing
therein one quantization table (Q table) corresponding
to a predetermined quantization accuracy, a memory 103
for storing therein a Huffman coding table, a quantizing
unit 104, a Huffman coding unit 105, an FIFO (first-in
first-out) memory 106, a
