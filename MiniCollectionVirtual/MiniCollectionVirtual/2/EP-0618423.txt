<ABSTRACT>
A track-laying vehicle (tracked vehicle), especially a bulldozer, having a front attachment (1), the front attachment (1) being operatively connected, such that it can be raised and lowered, to the track-laying vehicle via hydraulically or pneumatically operating ram arrangements (cylinder/piston arrangements) (2) and possibly via frame limbs (3) which are articulated on the track-laying vehicle such that they can pivot, and having a box (4) which is at least partially open at the front and at the bottom in the direction of travel and has a cutting drum (5) which is arranged therein essentially transversely with respect to the direction of travel and is driven in a revolving manner preferably hydraulically, is characterised by use as a mine- clearing vehicle, the cutting drum (5) rotating counter to the direction of travel, conveying the mines in front of the cutting drum (5) and causing them to explode there by the application of pressure.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a tracked vehicle with a frontal attachment (1) as a 
mine-clearing vehicle, wherein the frontal attachment (1) is 

operatively connected, in such a way that it can be raised and 
lowered, to the tracked vehicle by way of hydraulically or 

pneumatically working cylinder/piston arrangements (2) and, 
optionally, by way of frame pieces (3) articulated pivotably 

on the tracked vehicle, and has a box (4) which is at least 
partially open forwards and downwards in the direction of 

travel, with a hoeing drum (5) which is disposed therein 
essentially transversely to the direction of travel and is 

driven in rotation preferably hydraulically, and wherein the 
hoeing drum (5) rotates against the direction of travel, 

conveys soil and mines (9) contained therein in front of the 
hoeing drum (5) and causes the mines (9) to explode at that 

point, that is to say in the soil, because of the pressure 
exerted on the mines (9) by the hoeing drum. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the box (4) 
has at least the width of the tracked vehicle. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
hoeing drum (5) extends over the entire width of the box (4). 
Use according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the speed of rotation of the hoeing drum (5) can be 

adjusted, preferably in a continuous manner. 
Use according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the direction of rotation of the hoeing drum (5) can be 

reversed. 
Use according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the depth of hoeing can be adjusted by cylinder/piston 

arrangements (2) which depress or raise the box (4) and/or the 
hoeing drum (5).  

 
Use according to claim 6, characterised in that the hoeing 
drum (5) can be pressed or forced into the soil to a working 

depth of about 1 m. 
Use according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the frontal attachment (1) has, on its front side, a flap 

(7) which can be pivoted, preferably hydraulically, as a 
protective shield or for closing the box (4) on the front 

side. 
Use according to claim 8, characterised in that the flap 
(7) can be secured in position in such a way as to incline 

obliquely forwards and preferably project away upwards as a 
protective shield. 
Use according to claim 8, characterised in that the flap 
(7) is pivotably articulated, inside the box (4), on two 

mutually opposed side walls and the box (4) can be closed, at 
least to a large extent, by a downwardly directed pivoting 

movement. 
Use according to claim 8, characterised in that the flap 
(7) is pivotably articulated on the upper edge of the box (4) 

and the said box (4) can be closed by a downwardly directed 
pivoting movement. 
Use according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that, with 
the box (4) preferably closed or at least partially closed, 

the hoeing drum (5), which engages in the soil and rotates 
against the direction of travel, conveys the soil over the 

mine (9) and against the flap (7), with the box (4) preferably 
closed or at least partially closed. 
Use according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in 
that the hoeing drum (5) has cutting and/or breaking tools (8) 

which are spaced apart from one another over the peripheral 
face, preferably in a uniform manner, and thus grasps the mine  

 
(9) from below and causes it to explode in the earth conveyed 

in front of the hoeing drum (5) because of the pressure 
exerted on the mine (9) at that point.
