<ABSTRACT>
Ion-optical system for gas discharge ion source comprising a screen grid (1) and an accelerating grid (2) consisting of frames (3, 4) and a system of parallel wires (5, 6) attached to said frames by means of springs (21). The grid frames are assembled using insulators (7) to which they are fastened. The system includes a shifting device (9) for adjustment of the wires in each grid, comprising rollers (11) disposed transversally in relation to the wires in each grid and including guiding elements (12) receiving said wires. The rollers are mounted on the grid frames and can rotate about their axes and change their spacial position in space together with the wires. Preferably, in a first embodiment, each roller is mounted by means of a shaft end articulated to the frame, and is, by means of an opposite shaft end, installed in an off-centre sleeve, mounted in the frame with the possibility of rotating about its axis. In another embodiment, each roller is installed by its shaft ends in off-centre sleeves disposed in the frames and can rotate about its axis, one of the shaft ends of each roller being articulated to the off-centre sleeve.
