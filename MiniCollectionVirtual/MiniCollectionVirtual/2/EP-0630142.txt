<ABSTRACT>
Messages which cannot be delivered into the mailbox of the addressee of the message (for example in the case of operational faults) in interlinked message storage units (VMS1,... VMS3) are transmitted back to the mailbox of the message sender after a predeterminable time. Each message is provided with a message-individual information (for example the name of the message sender, time of message generation). To avoid that, when the same message is broadcast to a plurality of message addressees and, when the messages cannot be delivered, these are stored several times in the storage unit of the message sender, the message-individual information of messages transmitted back is checked for identity and are not stored when they are identical.

<CLAIMS>
Method for storing messages in voice mail units
(VMS1,...VMS3) connected into a network, which voice

mail units (VMS1,...VMS3) in each case have at least
one address-individual mailbox (MB1.1,...MB1.n;

MB2.1,...,MB2.m; MB3.1,...,MB3.o), one mailbox
(MBS1.1,...) in each case being allocated to message

senders, interacting controllers (CC1,...CC3) being
allocated to the voice mail units (VMS1, ... ,VMS3) and

the mailboxes (MBS1.1,...) allocated to the message
senders, messages generated by a message sender being

in each case transmittable to a multiplicity of
addressee-individual mailboxes (MB1.1,...MB1.n;

MB2.1,..., MB2.m; MB3.1,..., MB3.o), characterized in
that buffer memories (MEM1,...MEM3) allocated to the

voice mail units (VMS1,...,VMS3) for temporarily
storing addressee-individual messages, that a control

programme, which is designed in such a manner that
messages are provided with a message-individual

information item during their generation, is allocated
to the controllers (CC1,...CC3), that

addressee-individual messages, after having been
generated, are stored in the buffer memories

(MEM1, ... MEM3) of the voice mail unit (VMS1, ... ,VMS3)
allocated to the addressee-individual voice mailbox,

that addressee-individual messages which are not
transferred from a buffer memory (MEM1,...MEM3) into

the associated addressee-individual mailbox
(MB1.1, ...; MB2.1, ... ;MB3.1, ...) within a 

predeterminable time are transferred back into the
mailbox (MBS.1,...) allocated to the message sender,

that the controller (CCS1) allocated to the mailbox
(MBS1.1,...) of the message sender checks

message-individual information items of incoming
messages for identity and if the identity of a

message-individual information item of an incoming
message with a message-individual information item of a

message already received is detected, does not store
the incoming message in the mailbox (MBS1.1,...) of the

message sender.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in the case of the identity of message-individual

information items of received messages, the controller
(CCS1) of the mailbox (MBS1.1,...) allocated to the

message senders stores an information item designating
the return transmission of the message from the

original message addressee in the mailbox (MBS1.1,...)
allocated to the message sender.
Circuit arrangement (VMS1) for carrying out the
method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that it exhibits a controller (CCS1)
and at least one memory (MBS1.1) allocated to the

message sender and that the programme allocated to the
controller (CCS1) is designed in such a manner that

message-individual information items of incoming
messages are checked for identity.
