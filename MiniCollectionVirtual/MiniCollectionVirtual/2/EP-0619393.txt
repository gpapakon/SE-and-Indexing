<ABSTRACT>
The fabrics of this invention have a unique combination 
of liquid barrier properties and high air permeability and 

comprise at least one carded nonwoven web comprising at 
least 10% by weight, based on the total weight of cardable 

fibers, of cardable polyolefin fibers having a fiber 
fineness of 0.5 to 1.2 decitex. Preferably the polyolefin 

fibers have a hydrophobic surface, and the nonwoven material 
is thermally consolidated. Laminates comprising at least 

one layer of the fabrics of this invention and at least one 
layer of another nonwoven material are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nonwoven materials made from 
polyolefin fibers, and to laminates incorporating these 
materials. Nonwoven web structures are generally produced using 
three basic processes: (1) spunbonding, where continuous 
filaments are extruded and deposited on a screen to form a 
continuous nonwoven structure; (2) meltblowing, where the 
extruded polymer melt is stretched, broken into short 
fibers, blown by a jet of heated air, and deposited on a 
belt to form the nonwoven structure; and (3) carding, where 
staple fibers are separated by a carding machine and laid 
out in a nonwoven web structure. Nonwoven materials are commonly used in the manufacture 
of protective garments such as those worn by medical 
personnel, clean room personnel, and farm workers. For 
example, U.S. Patent 5,108,827 discloses a thermally-bonded 
nonwoven fabric that is made from a web comprising 100 to 5 
weight percent multiconstituent fibers. The fibers are made 
from a dispersion of two or more polymers that can be melt  
 
spun into fibers and then formed into webs, e.g., by 
carding, airlaying, or wetlaying. Biconstituent staple 
fibers made from a blend of ethylene/1-octene and 
polypropylene can be used. Nonwoven materials to be used in the manufacture of 
such protective garments have two essential requirements: 
liquid barrier properties, and comfort to the wearer. Most 
of the liquid barrier fabrics currently available exhibit 
very low air permeability, causing heat build-up and 
therefore heat stress for the garment wearer. Some 
currently available fabrics such as spunbonded materials 
provide adequate air flow, but lack the required liquid 
barrier properties. There is a need for a nonwoven material 
that exhibits a combination of impermeability to liquids and 
high air permeability. EP-A-486 158 relates to a process for preparing 
polyolefin-containing high crimp spun fiber or filament 
suitable for nonwoven material of high hydrophobicity using 
certain topically applied finishes. A variety of nonwoven 
materials may be produced utilizing webs obtained, for 
instance, from carded staple. The fabrics of the present invention comprise at least 
one carded nonwoven web which comprises at least 10% by 
weight, based on the total weight of cardable fibers, of 
cardable polyolefin staple fibers having a fiber fineness of 
0.5 to 1.2 decitex, and such fabrics have a liquid strike-through 
resistance (mm of H2O) of at least 150 millimeters 
and an air permeability of at least 40.6 cm3/cm2/sec (80
