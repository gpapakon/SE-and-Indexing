<ABSTRACT>
A non-invasive device and method for continuously monitoring concentration levels of blood constituents utilizes a polychromatic light source that emits light over a broad spectrum of wavelenghts. The light is passed through, or reflected from, a part of the subject. That light is then separated into its various components by means of a grating, or prism, and the near infrared band is focussed onto a linear array detector. A microprocessor uses the output of the array detector to measure the light transmitted (T), calculate the absorbance (log 1/T) and calculate the second derivative of the absorbance. A calibration equation is used for each constituent to be monitored to convert the absorbance second derivative measurements to a concentration level for that constituent. The device is programmed to take measurements between heart beats and to adjust for the temperature of the sample being taken. The memory in the microprocessor can be used to assist with record keeping and with dosage calculations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a non-invasive
device and method for continuously monitoring and
measuring concentration levels of blood constituents in
humans, using the near infrared portion of
the light spectrum and, in particular, relates to a
device suitable for continuously, or on demand,
monitoring concentration levels of blood contituents
within the human body.Previous devices for non-invasively
monitoring concentrations of blood constituents of a
patient are known. Usually, a sensor is used to
externally measure either the concentration of the
constituent in gases emitted by the body; or the
concentration contained in perspiration; or the
concentration contained in body fluids such as tears,
saliva, or urine samples; or, alternatively, the blood
constituent is measured using radiation passed through
a part of the patient's body such as the earlobe.However, some of the previous radiation
measuring devices, have a radiation source which emits
light in one wavelength only and are therefore not
accurate or broadly applicable enough for practical
use.Other previous devices (e.g. pulse oxymetry)
have more than one light source but have only a limited
number (e.g. three) of measuring wavelengths.In the U.S. Robinson Patent No. 4,975,581,
there is described a non-invasive device using a broadband
lamp whose light, after passing through the test
sample, for example the finger of a patient, is optically coupled through a number of light
filters, each with its own designated transmission 
wavelength, to the collector. While the Robinson
patent shows the use of several wavelengths at the
source, only a limited number of these wavelengths are
collected and only some of those collected actually
show differential absorption. With Robinson, fingers
of different sizes have a different path length.Some of these previous devices (e.g. U.S.
Rosenthal Patent No. 4,286,327) must measure both the
intensity changes in the range of transmission
wavelength and the changes in intensity distribution.
Further, some previous devices are controlled to take a
series of measurements at successively higher or lower
wavelengths. This can be extremely time consuming.Still further, some previous devices do not
take into account changes in the thickness of one
patient's earlobes (or other body part) compared to
that of other patients or the change in size of a
patient's earlobes (or other body part) and hence the
transmission path length due to the pulsing of blood
through the lobe (or other body part).Some prior devices do not take into
