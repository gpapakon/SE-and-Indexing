<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and
an apparatus for the determination of the

concentration of dissolved ammonia and to
a procedure for the manufacturing of a

detector. According to the invention, a
polypyrrole electrode (2), a reference

electrode (1) and an auxiliary electrode
(5) are placed in the liquid to be analyzed

and the concentration of ammonia
dissolved in the liquid is determined by

means of a potential applied between the
polypyrrole electrode (2) and the reference

electrode (1) and of the current
flowing between the polypyrrole electrode

(2) and the auxiliary electrode (5). A
polypyrrole layer (4) is formed on a

platinum substrate (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure according to 
the introdutory part of claim 1 and an apparatus according 
to the introductory part of claim 4 for the determination 
of concentration of ammonia. In addition, the invention 
relates to a procedure for manufacturing a detector and to 
the use of a detector for the determination of ammonia. In prior art, various methods and devices are used for the 
determination of concentration of ammonia in chemical and 
biochemical compounds. However, there is no previously 
known procedure or apparatus that enables the ammonia 
content of a liquid to be quickly determined without 
complex analyses. Dall'Olio et al, Akad.Sci., Ser.C 267 (1968) 8, p.433-435 
disclosed the possibility of electrochemical polymerisation 
of pyrrole. Diaz et al, J.C.S. Chem. Comm. (1979) p.635-636 
disclosed the conditions that allow electrochemical polymerisation 
of pyrrole on platinum, resulting in a durable 
electrode film with enhanced electrical conductivity and 
strong adherence. Bull et al, J. Electrochem. Soc., 129 
(1982), showed that a polypyrrole film deposited on 
platinum exhibits electron transfer reactions in solutions. 
Kanazawa et al, J.C.S.Chem.Comm. (1979), p.855-856, disclosed 
that exposing a polypyrrole film to ammonia reduces 
the conductivity of the film. Miasik et al, Conducting 
Polymers, Alcacer (ed.), D.Reidel Publishing Company 
(1987), p. 189-197, disclosed that a thin polypyrrole film 
formed by electropolymerization from an aqueous solution of 
pyrrole monomer and LiBF4 can be used as a chemiresistor 
sensitive to ammonia, i.e. as a resistor whose resistance 
value depends on the chemical composition of the substance 
which surrounds it and is in contact with it, in this case 
ammonia. The film was able to detect an ammonia content of  
 
0.1% in air. U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,294 disclosed that a 
chemiresistor based on polypyrrole film can be used for 
detecting the concentration of ammonia in atmospheric air 
by measuring the change in the resistance value. The object of the present invention is to achieve a new 
method and a new apparatus for the determination of ammonia 
dissolved in a liquid, as well as a new method for the 
manufacturing of a polypyrrole-based ammonia detector. To 
implement this, the invention is characterized by the features 
presented in the characterization parts of claims 1, 
4 and 7. The use of a detector according to the invention 
is disclosed in claim 9. Other embodiments of the invention 
are defined in the subclaims.
