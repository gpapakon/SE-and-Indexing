<ABSTRACT>
The screw pump for continuously conveying pulverulent and fine-grained bulk materials has a screw tree which conveys the bulk material from an inlet space (6) under low pressure into a conveying or pressure chamber (7) under higher pressure. The outlet of the pressure chamber (7) is sealed by a non-return flap (8). The screw tree is designed in two parts. It consists of a bearing shaft or drive shaft (3) mounted outside and of the screw (5, 16) itself. This screw is made from cast metal, preferably cast steel. The connection of the two parts is effected by a flange connection (4), there being provided on the flange of the bearing shaft or drive shaft a push-on spike (15), onto which the screw (5, 16) is pushed with the aid of a correspondingly designed and dimensioned inner bore. The screw can be manufactured economically with great wear resistance. Screw helix and core diameter of the screw shaft can be made with variable cross-sectional shapes in order consequently to make possible influence adapted to the different bulk materials. In the event of exchange, as a result of wear or the like, only the screw but not the bearing shaft or drive shaft is replaced.
