<ABSTRACT>
A filter comprises at least a pair of resonators (RES1,RES2) 
having an amplifier (AMP) inductively or capacitively 

coupled between the pair of resonators so that the power of 
an input signal input at IN passes through the amplifier and 

output at OUT to provide filtered and amplified output 
signal. By integrating an amplifier into the filter, this 

removes the need for an amplifier usually provided 
externally to the filter, thus saving space in a product 

incorporating this filter.This filter could be used as part 
of a duplex filter of a radio transceiver, where, for 

example,the amplifier could replace one of the stages of a 
multistage amplifier in the transmission branch of the radio 

transceiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter for providing an 
output signal from an input signal input thereto,the output 
signal having a frequency in a predetermined frequency 
range, and the filter comprising at least one pair of 
intercoupled resonators. The invention also relates to a 
radio transceiver comprising such a filter. In virtually all communications systems, for example, in 
radio transmitter - receivers (transceivers),for example in 
radio telephones, one or more filters are used for the 
purposes of separating wanted signals e.g information - 
bearing signals from unwanted signals such as 
interference, noise and distorting products. A simplified block diagram of part of a radio telephone is 
shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. As is well known to persons skilled in the art,a radio 
transceiver,for example, as used in a radio telephone 
includes a receiver section and a transmitter section for 
receiving and transmitting radio frequency (RF) 
communication signals. When transmitting, audio signals are 
input via a microphone to a modulator where a carrier signal 
is modulated with the input audio signal. The carrier signal 
is provided by a synthesizer or, for example,a crystal 
oscillator,for sufficient frequency stability, and has a 
frequency of between 6 and 25 MHz. The modulated signal is 
amplified by a power amplifier 1 and then coupled to a band 
pass filter 3 and, then to an antenna 4 for onward 
transmission. The power amplifier 1 of the receiver section 
of the radio telephone usually comprises several stages. When receiving,a received signal is detected by the antenna  
 
4 and coupled via the filter 3 to a radio frequency 
amplifier 2 and then to a mixer where the signal is mixed 
with a signal from a local oscillator thereby translating 
the output from the RF amplifier 2 to an intermediate 
frequency signal which is subsequently further amplified and 
demodulated. For sufficient selection ability and gain the 
receivers are usually constructed on the so-called double 
superhet principle in which the RF signal is translated 
twice before demodulation. The gain of the RF amplifier 2 
is, in general low, and the bandwidth large. When a single antenna 4 is used for both transmission and 
reception,a duplex filter 3 is used to prevent the 
transmission signals from travelling to the receiver 
section, and the received signals from travelling to the 
transmitter section. As with all the above, this is well 
known to persons skilled in the art, as is the construction
