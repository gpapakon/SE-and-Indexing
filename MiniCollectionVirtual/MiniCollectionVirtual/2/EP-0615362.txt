<ABSTRACT>
A network analysis method is applied to traffic data collected in respect of a 
network of the type comprising a plurality of logical segments (X1 to X4) each 

with a plurality of nodes (N). The method involves processing the traffic data by 
preferentially removing traffic associated with nodes identified as acting as global 

servers, and using the remaining traffic to identify nodes acting as local servers 
(N4 to N7). Upon the local servers being identified, the network analysis method 

carries out further processing to make sugggestions as to whether any of these 
local servers should be moved to another logical segment (X4) and as to whether 

it would be worthwhile splitting a segment (X2) between two associated local 
servers (N6,N7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network analysis method for use in relation to
a network of the type comprising a plurality of sub-networks each with a plurality
of nodes.The network analysis method of the invention has particular application to
networks where the component sub-networks are logical segments interconnected
by bridges operating at level 2 of the seven layer OSI Reference Model.
However, the network analysis method can also be used in appropriate
circumstances with other networks such as Internet networks with "IP" sub-networks
interconnected by routers or gateways operating at level 3 of the OSI
Reference Model.As network monitoring systems become more and more sophisticated and
comprehensive, the network operator has an increasing problem identifying
significant data amongst the volumes of data on network operation provided by
such monitoring systems. This is particularly so where the network concerned
comprises several sub-networks with certain nodes acting as global servers across
all sub-networks as in such cases it is difficult to get a true picture of what is
really happening on each sub-network.It is an object of the present invention to provide a network analysis method that
facilitates an appreciation of operation of the network at a sub-network level.To this end, in one aspect the present invention provides a network analysis 
method that serves to identify nodes acting as local servers, that is, nodes that
predominantly deal with one particular sub-network. More particularly, in this
aspect the present invention provides a network analysis method for use in relation
to a network of the type comprising a plurality of sub-networks each with a
plurality of nodes, the method comprising the steps of:-
(1) monitoring the network to collect and store traffic data indicative of the
linkage between nodes as judged by traffic therebetween; and(2) processing the traffic data by removing traffic associated with
nodes identified as acting as global servers, and using the remaining traffic
to identify nodes acting as local servers.The preferential removal of the global server traffic effectively unmasks the local
servers enabling them to be identified.Step (2) of the method preferably involves examining the traffic data to identify
any candidate global server amongst said nodes where a candidate global server
is a node whose linkage to any of said sub-networks is less than a first
predetermined portion (generally 50%) of its total linkage to all nodes, and
where a said candidate global

A network analysis method for use in relation to a network of the type
comprising a plurality of sub-networks (X1-X4) each with a plurality of nodes (N), the method

comprising the step of:-

(1) monitoring the network to collect and store traffic data (22) indicative of the
linkage between nodes as judged by traffic therebetween;
(2) processing the traffic data and 
characterised by
 the step of (22) by removing traffic associated with
nodes identified as acting as global servers (N1-N3), and using the remaining traffic

to identify nodes acting as local servers (N4-N7).
A method according to Claim 1, wherein step (2) involves examining the
traffic data (22) to identify any candidate global server (N1-N3) amongst said nodes (N) where a

candidate global server is a node whose linkage to any of said sub-networks is less
than a first predetermined portion of its total linkage to all nodes, and


where a said candidate global server (N1-N3) is identified, identifying the candidate
global server with the highest total linkage, removing its associated traffic

from the traffic data (22), and returning to the start of step (2) to repeat the step
using the traffic data so modified;
where no such candidate global server is identified, examining the traffic
data (22) to identify any candidate local server (N4-N7) amongst said nodes where a

candidate local server is a node for which for the sub-network with the
highest linkage thereto, this linkage is equal to or greater than a second

predetermined portion of the total linkage of that candidate local server,
and


where a said candidate local server (N4-N7) is identified, identifying the
candidate local server with the highest linkage, recording this

candidate as a local server, removing its associated traffic from the 
traffic data (22), and returning to the start of step (2) to repeat the step

using the traffic data so modified;
where no said candidate local server is identified, exiting step (2).
A method according to Claim 2, wherein said first and second
predetermined portions are both a half.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
traffic data is stored as traffic elements (22) each providing an indication of traffic

between a pair of said nodes, modification of the traffic data to remove traffic
associated with a said server being effected by marking the relevant traffic

elements as currently disabled.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
linkage of a node (N) with other associated nodes is measured in terms of at least one

of the following:-

number of associated nodes;
number of frames involved in the traffic with the associated nodes;
number of bytes involved in the traffic with the associated nodes.
A method according to any one of the preceding Claims, wherein in step
(1) of Claim 1 the monitoring of the network is carried out in such a manner as

to enable role information to be gathered indicative of whether a node (N) is acting in
a server or client role in relation to individual traffic items associated therewith,

the identification of a node as a global or local server in step (2) being effected
without reference to traffic for which the node is acting as a client as indicated by

said role information. 
A method according to Claim 6, wherein said role information is derived
on the basis of the well known port status of the node end points associated with

traffic passed between a pair of nodes (N), one node of said pair being identified as
acting in a server role and the other node in a client role where the end point for

said one node is a well known port whilst the other end point is otherwise.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein for at
least one of the local servers (N5) identified in step (2) of claim 1, a determination is

made as to the optimum sub-network (X4) for this local server, said determination
involving notionally locating the local server (N5) concerned on each sub-network (X1-X4) in

turn and evaluating for each such location of the local server, a predetermined
optimal-location function that provides a measure of the traffic between sub-networks

that would be associated with the local server in its current notional
location, such determination further involving identifying as said optimum subnetwork

that sub-network (X4) for which evaluation of said function indicates a
minimum for said traffic between sub-networks.
A method according to Claim 8, wherein said optimum-location function
is a count of nodes that have linkage with the local server (N5) concerned and are

located on sub-networks other than the one corresponding to the said current
notional location of the local server.
A method according to Claim 8 or Claim 9, wherein for a said local server (N5)
whose said optimum sub-network (X4) has been determined, a determination is also

made as to whether, if this local server (N5) is located on its said optimum subnetwork
(X4), any of the nodes to which is has linkage as a server, should also be

moved to said optimum sub-network (X4); this determination involving testing for each
node whether the linkage between that node and the local server (N5) is 

half or more of the total linkage of that node.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein for the
group of local servers (N4-N7) identified in step (2) of Claim 1, each local server is taken

in turn in order of descending linkage and for each such server:-

(i) a respective workgroup (26) is created therefor unless the local server concerned
has already been allocated to another workgroup created in respect of a

said local server higher in said order,
(ii) if a said respective workgroup (26) has been created in (i) for the local server
concerned, then the server is allocated to that workgroup, and
(iii) any node whose linkage to the local server is at least half of
the total linkage of that node is allocated to the same workgroup as the

local server.
A method according to Claim 11, wherein for at least one said subnetwork
(X2) a determination is made whether it is worthwhile splitting the subnetwork

into two sub-networks, this determination involving:-

(a) pruning the or each workgroup that has been created in respect of a local
server (N6,N7) located on the sub-network of interest (X2), by removing from the

workgroup any node that is located on a different sub-network to the one
of interest, and any node whose inclusion in the workgroup relies directly

or indirectly on its association with a node located on a different
subnetwork to the one of interest;
(b) forming a respective further workgroup for each node of the sub-network
of interest (X2) where that node is not already in a workgroup associated with

the sub-network;
(c) merging the workgroups associated with the sub-network of interest until
only two such workgroups remain; and
(d) deciding whether it is worthwhile splitting the sub-network (X2) by comparing 
the amount of traffic between the two workgroups left remaining after step

(c) with the total traffic associated with each such workgroup.
A method according to Claim 12, wherein step (c) involves an iterative
process in which during each iteration, the workgroup with the smallest amount

of associated traffic is merged with the workgroup with which it has the greatest
linkage.
