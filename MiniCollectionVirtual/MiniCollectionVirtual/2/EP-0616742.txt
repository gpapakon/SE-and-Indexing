<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for increasing the capacity and quality of wireless communication between a plurality of remote users and a base station is disclosed. Using measurements from an array of receiving antennas at the base station, parameters of multiple signals transmitted to the base station from a plurality of users in the same channel are calculated and used to obtain the positions and velocities of the users. The locations and other related signal parameters are used to calculate appropriate spatial demultiplexing strategies, reconstructing the individual transmitted signals from the receiver measurements and reducing interference to acceptable levels. This heretofore unavailable location information is used in solving the hand-off problem. This information is also used to calculate an appropriate spatial multiplexing strategy for simultaneous transmission of signals to users in the same channel. This can be the same as or ditinct from the aforementioned receive channel. In combination, the transmit and receive systems establish multiple full-duplex links in the same channel by directively receiving and transmitting signals at the base stations only. This invention can also be implemented at the mobile sites to improve signal quality and to establish point-to-point communication links between multiple mobile users. Furthermore, implementation of both transmit and receive functions at the base station is not required. A receive-only system base station will still improve received signal quality and therefore capacity in addition to mitigating the hand-off problem.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SPATIAL DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe field of this invention relates generally to multiple access wireless information and communication networks and, in particular, to a method and apparatus for exploiting information collected by arrays of spatially distributed sensors to substantially mcrease the number and quality of communication channels in wireless networks by establishing spatially directive links capable of full-duplex operation in nonstationary environments without increasing the amount of allocated frequency spectrum. 

 BACKGROUNDWireless communication systems are generally composed of one or more local central sites, herein termed base stations, through which wireless transmitter/receivers gain access to a larger information network- The base stations service a local area wherein a number of wireless users, fixed or mobile, are located. The function of the base station is to relay messages to and from users all over the network- In cellular mobile systems, for example, this task is performed by relaying messages to and receiving signals from a Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO). A wireless user establishes a two-way (full-duplex) communication link with one or more other users also having some access to the network by first requesting access to the network through the local base station- This communication is accomplished in cellular mobile communications and wireless local area computer networks (LANs), for example, by suitably modulating electromagnetic waves-Conventional wireless communication systems require that users transmit signals in different frequency channels- use different coding schemes in the same frequency channels, or be transmitted in non-overlapping time intervals for the signals to be correctly received. One aspect of the present invention describes a method and apparatus for separating multiple messages in the same frequency, code, or time channel using the fact, that they are in different spatial channels- Hereinafter, the term channel will be used to denote any of the conventional channels (frequency, time, code) or any combination thereof. The term spatial channel refers to the new concept unique to the present invention.Wireless communication is becoming an increasingly common form of communication (D- Goodman, "Trends in Cellular and Cordless Communications," IEEE Communications Magazine, June 1991), and the demand for such service continues to grow- Examples include cellular mobile communication networks,
