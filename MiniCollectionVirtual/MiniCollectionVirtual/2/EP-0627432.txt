<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds having Formula I depicted below, 
 
where 
n is an integer of 1 or 2; R1 is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl or aryl-C1-C6-alkyl; R2 is hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl or hydroxy-substituted C1-C6-alkyl ; and X is -H, -CN, -COOH, -COOR3 or -CONR4R5, R3 being loweralkyl; R4 being hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl or aryl-C1-C6-alkyl; and R5 being hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl;  
which compounds are selective inhibitors of the reuptake of serotonin and as such are 
useful for the treatment of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply 
throughout the specification and the appended claims. The term C1-C6-alkyl shall mean a straight or branched alkyl group having 
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of said C1-C6-alkyl include methyl, ethyl, 
n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl and straight- and branched-chain  
 
pentyl and hexyl. The term aryl in each occurrence shall mean a phenyl group optionally 
mono-substitutedwitha C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, halogen, nitro or trifluoromethyl 
group. The term halogen shall mean fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical 
formula or name shall encompass all geometric, stereo, optical and tautomeric 
isomers where such isomers exist. EP-A-0 594 001 discloses pyrazolo(4,3-c)pyridines, a process for their preparation 
and their use as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. US-A-4 020 072 discloses 5-aminomethyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines which are 
useful as psychotropic agents. DE-A-26 17 157 discloses 4-amino derivatives of 2H-pyrazolo(3,4-b)pyridin-5-carboxylic 
acids and esters, which exhibit CNS depressant activity and can, 
therefore, be used as tranquilizer and anxiolytics. GB-A-1 447 672 discloses 4-amino derivatives of pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carboxamides, 
which exhibit CNS depressant activity and may be used as ataractic 
agents, and further as analgesic and hypotensive agents. DE-A-2 225 433 discloses aminopyrazolo(3,4-b)pyridin-5-ketones which show 
besides antiinflammatory also CNS depressant activity, and may, therefore, be used 
as tranquilizers and ataractic agents. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by utilizing one or more of 
the synthetic steps described below. Throughout the description of the synthetic steps, the notations n, X and R1 
through R5 shall have the respective meanings given above unless otherwise stated or 
indicated. 2,6-Difluoropyridine is allowed to react with
