<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the adjustment of a controllable, flow regulating device (42) for regulation of the flow of liquids or gases by means of an operating device (32). In this, there is a spatial distance between the device (42) and the operating device (32) and these two devices are not physically connected. According to the invention, the energy required for adjustment of the flow regulating device (42) is obtained via energy transfer from the physically separate operating device (32) into the appliance (33) with the flow regulating device (42). The flow regulating device (42) can be controlled only during the time of energy transfer. The device working by the method according to the invention comprises an appliance (33) with flow regulating device (42) and an external operating device (32) which permits the flow regulating device (42) to be controlled. The essential feature is the fact that the flow regulating device (42) is a multistable controllable flow regulating device.
