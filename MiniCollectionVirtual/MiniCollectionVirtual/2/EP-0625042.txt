<DESCRIPTION>
 Confectionery delivery system for pharmaceutically active substancesThe aim of the present invention is to propose a confectionery form of matrix suited to contain micro¬ capsules for controlled release of pharmacologically active substances, of fixed content, which is soluble in the mouth and readily swallowed without chewing, as well as the process for the preparation thereof.Since the microcapsules for controlled release of pharmacologically active substances are not resistant to the high pressures created in the tabletting machines, tablets containing microcapsules for controlled release of pharmaceutically active substances are rarely manu¬ factured.Thus, the most widespread form for the oral ad¬ ministration of microcapsules for controlled release of pharmaceutically active substances are the gelatin cap- sules.However, many patients and particularly children refuse to swallow a medicine in the form of a usual gelatin capsule available in the market.In these patients, the feeling that the capsule -is a foreign body that may make them choke neutralises the mechanism of swallowing.The need consequently exists for the creation of a system of a matrix that would permit the easy oral ad¬ ministration of microcapsules for controlled release of pharmaceutically active substances, which is soluble in the mou€h without chewing.Prior_State-of-the-ArtDE-A 336 216 describesa process for coating phar- maceutically active substances for the formation of mi¬ cro capsules which are resitant to the pressures created during tabletting, nevertheless, it imposes considerable limitations in the selection of materials used for saidSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 coating.FR-A 2011960 renders formulated pieces which in¬ clude microcapsules containing pharmaceutically active substances administered orally, nevertheless, it pre- sents the disadvantage that the mixture to be formula¬ ted is exposed to relatively high temperatures for con¬ siderable time, a fact which creates serious risks for alteration or for shortening of the shelf-life of var¬ ious thermolabile pharmaceutical substances. Patent Application EP-0 239983 describesa process which avoids the high temperatures employed in FR-A 2011960 buth which, despite the fact that it makes use of readily melted mixtures, likewise strains, from the thermal point of view, even though to a smaller extent, the pharmaceutically active substances.Patent Application EP-0 227603 grants a confec¬ tionery system for the administration of medicines by means of chewing but likewise strains, from

 Claims
1. Process for the preparation of a confectionery formulation consisting of well known per se microcap- sules for controlled release of pharmaceutically active substances enclosed within a matrix. , characterised in that in the vessel of its preparation, the pharmaceutically acceptable binding mixture of ice-cream substitute used for the formulation is liquid at a temperature of -1°C up to 0 C under which is effected, under appropriate stirring, the addition to the latter and the homogeneous dispersion of the provisionally water-proof microcapsules, in a precise predertmined ratio, and in that the composi- tion and viscosity are appropriate for its rapid solidi¬ fication within an appropriate equipment for production, kneading and formulation of ice-cream, with the simulta¬ neous enclosure, under pressure, within the mass of approximately 100% nitrogen by volume (volume/volume) or of some other inert gas. by final cooling to approxima¬ tely -20 C, for the creation of a formulation of ice-cream of a variety of geometrical or artistic shapes or colours, made up of elementary "trihasic particles" which are a mixture of a principal solid phase of ice-cream, a pos- sibly minimal liquid phase of a solution of sugar and milk salts, and an abudant gaseous nitrogen phase, as well as of the aforementioned microcapsules, which, when warm¬ ed inside the mouth, given the impression of a smooth pleasant texture and taste of ice-cream cream that melts in a very short time without being chewed, avoiding the risk of damage of the microcapsules caused by chewing or previous warming thereof during the production process of the confectionery formulation.
2. Process in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that, prior to their addition to the confectionery
SUBSTITUTESHEET 


 binding mixture, the microcapsules containing the pharmaceutically active substance are rendered provisionally water-proof inside a revolving special vessel used for the coating oftablets (coating-drum) by coating with a sufficient quantity of edible plant oil such as for instance peanut oil or sesame oil or olive oil or palm oil, etc., which is added at a very slow rate, in small portions, as a spray that is pro¬ duced under very high pressure, and subsequently by blowing a cool air at a temperature sufficiently lower than the melting point of the corresponding oil, in order to obtain the polishing of the microcapsules fol¬ lowing solidification of the oil, and in that they are immediately transferred into the vessel of the ice-cream production machine, under stirring for their mixing with the liquid cream at a temperature of approximately 0 C up to -1 C.
3. Process in accordance with claims 1 and 2 charac- terised in that, prior to their being rendered water¬ proof by means of vegetal oil and in order to complete their water-proofing, the microcapsules are polished eventually by means of a suitable layer of readily melt¬ ing mixture of synthetic waxes or other pharmaceutically acceptable hydrphobic materials whose melting point is below 30 c, such as for instance liquid paraffin or mix¬ ture thereof.
4. Process in accordance with claims 1 - 3 characterised in that air may be used instead of nitrogen or any other inert gas for the swelling of the formulation.
5. Process in accordance with claims 1 to 3 or 4 cha¬ racterised in that the formed pieces of various geome- trical or artistic shapes or colours and dimensions are coated with a fine layer of chocolate and/or caramel or
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


 wafer or other suitable confectionery coating or com¬ bination thereof.
6. Process in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the formed piece bears subdividing scores, such as those, for instance, borne on chocolates available in the market.
7. Process in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that the formed piece is a sandwich of microcapsules within two or more layers of ice-cream substitute hermetically packaged inside a thin-walled recipient consisting of a composite sheet with layers of paper, plastic and/or metal.
8. Process in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that the formed pieces are stored for a long time at approximately -40 C and for daily or weekly consumption at approximately -20 C. o o
9. New, stored at -18 C up to -40 C, formed confectionery, solid system for oral administration of well known per se microcapsules or microspherules for the controlled release of pharmaceutically active substances of all kinds in ac- cordance with any of claims 1 - 8, characterised in that its texture and taste are those of ice-cream and in that it is offered as a formed piece of the composition in¬ dicated below, richer or poorer in calories.
