<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims to achieve a two-sided clamp for 
manipulating heads of paper rolls. The clamp comprises 

an arm (14) having its one end attached to the wrist 
joint of a robot and the other end carrying two grasping 

means (11, 12) which are aligned parallel and outward 
facing to opposite directions. Each of the grasping 

means (11, 12) comprises a base plate and multiple 
resilient suction cups (13) which are mounted to the 

base plate. The grasping means (11, 12) are mounted to 
the arm (14) so that the clamping center point T1 of the 

first grasping means (12) is farther removed from the 
wrist joint (19) of the robot (2) in the direction of the 

longitudinal axis of the arm (14) than the clamping 
center point T2 of the second suction member (11). The 

grasping means (11, 12) are mounted in an 
asymmetrical manner to the arm (14). The asymmetrical 

structure of the clamp facilitates the two-sided structure 
of the clamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-sided clamp according to the preamble of 
claim 1 for placing heads on the ends of paper rolls. In the wrapping of paper rolls the inner heads are first placed onto the ends of 
each roll, after which a sufficient length of the wrapper is placed about the roll 
and then the overlaps of the wrapper are crimped over the rims of the inner 
heads. Conventionally using a hot-melt glue, the outer heads are then adhered to 
the ends of the roll, thus covering the crimped edge of the wrapper and the inner 
head. The inner head is usually relatively thick and thus capable of protecting the 
roll end against mechanical damage. The outer head can thus be thinner serving 
for the purpose of binding the wrapper at the roll ends and protecting the roll 
against humidity. Frequently, the coloring and printed pattern of the outer head 
are designed to give the roll a neat appearance. The heads can be placed on the roll ends in multiple different ways. Manual 
placement of the heads is the oldest method, and it is still suited for relatively 
small-capacity wrapping lines or applications not requiring an improved degree of 
automation. Here, the operator simply places the inner heads manually to the roll 
ends and the corresponding outer heads onto heated press platens, which next 
press the outer heads to adhere to the roll ends. The inner heads are held against 
the roll ends by means of separate retaining arms for the duration of the crimping 
of the wrapper overlaps against the roll ends. The adherence of the outer heads 
on the platens is in turn implemented with the help of a vacuum. Various kinds of automatic heading machines have long been in use and several 
different types of such equipment are known. A common feature for almost all 
automatic heading equipment is that, for each end of the roll, a separate apparatus 
with a head clamp is provided that serves for moving the head from the head pile 
to the roll end. In a prior-art heading machine, a rotatable arm is mounted on a 
vertical guide, said arm having at its end a rotatable vacuum clamp for grasping  
 
the heads. Such a heading machine is conventionally used in conjunction with 
different kinds of head storage shelves situated beside the heading machine. Using 
this machine, the heads are placed on the roll end so that the support arm of the 
clamp is transferred along the vertical guide to the level of the shelf containing 
the correct size of heads. Next, the support arm of the clamp and the heading 
machine

<CLAIMS>
A clamp for grasping/holding heads (9, 10) during the transfer of said heads 
from a head pile (1) to the ends of a roll (18), said clamp comprising: 


a body structure (14) suited for mounting to an actuator apparatus (2) 
of said clamp, and 
a first (12) and a second (11) grasping means, which are permanently 
fixed to said body structure and suited for grasping/holding heads on 

the clamp, said grasping means (11, 12) being fixed to said body 
structure (14) in a manner in which grasping elements (13) of said 

means are arranged facing outward in opposite directions and 
each 

grasping element forming a predetermined clamping center point (T1, 
T2), 
characterized
 in that 

the clamp has an asymmetrical construction wherein the normals 
passing through said clamping center points (T1, T2) of said first and 

second grasping means (11, 12) are displaced from each other. 
A clamp as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the body part 
of said clamp is an elongated arm (14) and the displacement between the normals 

(20, 21) passing through said clamping center points (T1, T2) is aligned essentially 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of said arm (14).
