<ABSTRACT>
A polyurethane suitable for producing leatherlike sheets, which is prepared by the reaction among a diol (A) having a tertiary 
amino group, a polymer diol (B) having the number-average molecular weight of 500 to 3,000 and selected from the group 

consisting of polyesters, polycarbonates, polylactones and polyethers, and an organic diisocyanate (C1) each in such an amount 
that the equivalent ratio of the NCO groups to the OH groups will range from 0.5 to 0.99 to thereby prepare an intermediate diol 

(D) substantially terminated by OH groups, followed by the reaction among the diol (D), a low-molecular-weight diol (E) and diphenylmethane 
4,4'-diisocyanate (C2); and a leatherlike sheet composed of the polyurethane and a fibrous base material, which 

is soft to the touch, excellent in durability, and dyeable with acid dyes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyurethane having
excellent dyeability and a leather-like sheet utilizing the
polyurethane. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a polyurethane having excellent mechanical
properties, durability and like properties and good
processability and being dyeable with acid dyes, and to a
leather-like sheet utilizing the polyurethane and being
dyeable with acid dyes.Polyurethanes have excellent mechanical properties.
Leather-like sheets utilizing polyurethane are used in
various applications. These sheets are obtained either by
permitting a fibrous base to be impregnated and/or applied
with a polyurethane solution, followed by conducting dry or
wet coagulation of the solution, or further applying a
surface coating layer of a polyurethane skin layer to a
fibrous base to which a polymer liquid has been applied and
solidified. However, conventional polyurethane resins have
no dyeable sites required for dyeing with acid dyes or
cationic dyes and have therefore been undyeable with these
dyes. Although the polyurethane resins are dyeable with
disperse dyes, the dyes can hardly be retained in the resins 
due to looseness of the amorphous structure of polyurethanes,
resulting in very poor color fastness. Thus, the
polyurethanes once dyed with disperse dyes readily undergo
color dropping off or fading away and have not been usable
for practical purposes.In order to improve the above drawback, introduction of
dyeable sites into polyurethane resins has been attempted.
It is known that use of a chain extender of a low molecular
weight compound having a tertiary nitrogen atom or piperazine
ring makes a polyurethane dyeable with acid dyes.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
55995/1973 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 16386 /1969
disclose that completion of reaction of unreacted isocyanate
groups by using a monofunctional alcohol or amine having in
the molecule thereof a tertiary or quaternary nitrogen atom
realizes production of a dyeable polyurethane.However, the monoufunctional alcohol or amine used in
the above process is introduced into the terminal of the
polyurethane molecules. Then, use of a large amount of the
alcohol or amine to increase the dyeability decreases the
molecular weight of the resulting polyurethane, resulting in
too low a viscosity of the polyurethane solution. As a
result, the polyurethane has poor processability and
mechanical properties. If the molecular weight of the
polyurethane is increased up to a level achieving
satisfacto
