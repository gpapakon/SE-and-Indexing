<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle tyre provided with a tread band (9) made of a low-carbon 

black blend, one or more conductive inserts (12) of an elastomeric 
material having a high carbon black content are provided, which 

inserts are incorporated in the tread band and extend in an annular 
configuration along the whole circumferential extension of the tread 

band. Each conductive insert (12) passes through the whole tread 
thickness and is exposed externally of the rolling surface (9a) of the 

tread band itself, acting by its opposite side (12b) in contact 
relationship on the belt (6), the carcass ply (2) or another tyre part 

having sufficient electric conductivity to enable the electrostatic 
charges stored by the vehicle on running to be discharged to the 

ground through the tyre via the conductive inserts themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antistatic tyre the tread band of
which has a low carbon black content, of the type comprising at least
one carcass ply anchored, at respective opposite edges thereof, to a
pair of bead cores arranged in corresponding beads defined along the
inner circumferential edges of said tyre; at least one belt layer
extending circumferentially about said carcass ply; a tread band
disposed circumferentially about the belt layer and externally
exhibiting a rolling surface designed to come into contact with the
ground.It is known that vehicle tyres in general must have, in addition to
usual roadholding and ride comfort features, also a certain degree of
electric conductivity so that the electrostatic charges inevitably
stored by the vehicle on running may be conveniently discharged to the
ground, at least within some limits.In this connection, there are several different regulations for
classifying the tyres depending on the electric resistivity they show
and/or fixing the maximum resistivity limits that the tyres must
exhibit based on the intended uses. By way of example, the German
regulation of the WIRTSCHAFTSVERBAND DER DEUTSCHEN KAUTSCHUKINDUSTRIE
E.V. (W.d.K. Leitlinie 110) classifies tyres into two different
classes, identifying in the first class tyres having an electric
resistance lower than 106 ohm, and in the second class tyres having an
electric resistance lower than 108 ohm. Still by way of example,
according to BSI (British Standards Institution) regulations BS
2050:1978 tyres used at the inside of hospitals must have an electric
resistance value lower than 104 ohm. Still in accordance with these
regulations, tyres used on industrial vehicles designed to carry
explosives must not have an electric resistance higher than 5x105 ohm.In tyres of earlier conception, for example those disclosed in GB
Patent No. 551 576, the necessary tyre conductivity was ensured by a
particularly conductive rubber strip extending from the radially outer
surface of the tread to the tyre bead, where it came into 
direct contact with the mounting rim located between the outermost
carcass ply and the outer surface of the tyre.Substantially the same solution is described also in DE-C-820 543.GB-A-544 757 teaches that an electrically conducting rubber cement,
when applied to specific portions of a pneumatic tyre, inside or
outside the carcass body, or even inserted in said body, will function
effectively in discharging static electricity.JP52-47202 teaches that, as an alternative to the
