<ABSTRACT>
A new set of surgical instruments is described which 
provides a movable constraint such that the instruments 

include a saw guide (5) which may be used in either a 
constrained or unconstrained fashion. The instruments 

have a movable restraint (16) which, in the down position 
provides a continuous surface with the remainder of the 

instrument for guiding a saw, and when in the up position 
provides a constrained slot for guiding the saw of a 

surgeon in making cuts in prosthesis implantation surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to instruments for performing
orthopaedic surgery, and in particular, to guides for
guiding saw blades in making cuts in orthopaedic joint
replacement.Many types of guide-like instruments are known for
orthopaedic surgery. In particular, fixed cutting guides
are applied to the exposed bone during knee surgery in
order to guide saw cuts of the bone in particular
predefined planes.Currently, not all devices available for aiming or guiding
an oscillating saw blade allow the surgeon to achieve a
flat, accurate cut unless certain forces are applied to
certain surfaces of a cutting block or guide. Devices
available with a capturing mechanism for saw blades that
will allow for precise bone cuts have fixed slots or
guides through which the saw blade passes and is firmly
and accurately guided into the correct plane. These
devices, although accurate, are generally larger and
heavier than devices that do not offer saw blade slots and
can actually obscure the surgeon's vision of the saw blade
while cutting. Other devices available allow the surgeon
to add on guide plates to a flat cutting guide. This is
done by assistant while the surgeon attempts to hold the
saw blade flat against the cutting surface. The most
skilled surgeon who chooses not to use captured cutting
guides or finds them cumbersome to use must have a set of
guides available to him without slots. This most often 
means increased instrument inventory and added cost to the
hospital as a set of unslotted instruments must be
maintained for such surgeons, while slotted instruments are
maintained for the remainder of the surgeons.EP-A-376657 is used as a basis for the preamble of claim 1.The purpose of this invention is to allow the orthopaedic
surgeon who desires to make precise bone cuts in the distal
femur, proximal tibia and patella to use a single set of
instruments which is not dependent on the style of surgery
that the surgeon performs.The instrument of the present invention is set out in Claim 1. An
orthopaedic surgeon using such an instrument is presented
with the option of using a capturing slot or no slot within
the same device without requiring the surgeon to perform the
cumbersome task of externally attaching saw guides. The
capturing mechanism is built into the cutting block in the
form of constraint means and is retractable. The surgeon
who chooses not to use the saw constraint means simply
leaves the constraint means in the retracted position. For
those surgeons who prefer captured saw blades, spring-actuated
or

<CLAIMS>
An instrument for orthopaedic surgery comprising:

a means for positioning said instrument in a fixed
predetermined position with respect to a bone to be cut;
a guide surface (5) for guiding a saw blade at a
predetermine orientation with respect to said bone; and
a movable constraint means (9) which, when in a first
position, is arranged to co-operate with said guide surface

(5) to constrain movement of a saw blade in a first
direction,

   characterised in that:
said constrain means (9) is moveable to a second
position wherein it forms part of said guide surface (5),

thereby permitting a saw blade to move in said first
direction.
The instrument of Claim 1, wherein said constraint
means (6) comprises:


a surface (11) which, when said constraint means (9)
is in said second position, is substantially coplanar with

said guide surface (5); and
a spaced constraint (17) which, when said constraint
means (9) is in said first position, is arranged to co-operate

with said guide surface (5) to restrict movement of
a saw blade in a direction perpendicular to said guide

surface (5).
The instrument of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein:

said constraint means (9) further has a second surface
in spaced parallel relationship with said first surface

(11);
said first surface (11) partially forms said guide
surface (5) when said constraint means (9) is in said first

position; and
said second surface partially forms said guide surface
(5) when said constraint means (9) is in said second

position.
The instrument of Claim 3, wherein said constraint

means (9) includes a pair of substantially parallel plates
(16 and 17) one of said plates (16) providing said first

surface (11) and the other of said plates (17) providing
said second surface.
The instrument of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein
said instrument includes a body (1) at least partially

defining an opening (7) for receiving a portion of said
constraint means (9) when said constraint means (9) is in

said second position.
