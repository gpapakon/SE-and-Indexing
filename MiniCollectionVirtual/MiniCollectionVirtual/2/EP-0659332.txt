<ABSTRACT>
Device for gathering and cutting forage and straw 
including a gathering unit that is adapted to lift the 

product from the field to make it available to a rotary 
feeder (8) provided with teeth (9,10) that are distributed 

in pairs and drag the product, which rests on a base surface 
(4); the device is characterized by a blade (21) which has a 

cutting motion, acts in the interspace between the two teeth 
(9,10) of each pair, and protrudes, at least in the active 

position, from a groove provided in the base surface (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for gathering 
and cutting forage and straw. It is known that currently there is a trend toward 
cutting the stalks of forage or straw, so as to reduce them 
to pieces measuring a few centimeters in length, when they 
are gathered from the field before introducing the product 
in the chamber of a press for forming bales or onto the 
loading platform of a self-loading trailer. The aim achieved with this cutting, if the product is 
reduced to cylindrical or prism-shaped bales, is a high 
compaction that helps to save storage space and provides 
optimum preservation conditions; said bales are furthermore 
constituted by a product that is already ready to be poured 
into mangers or fodder preparation mixers without having to 
undergo further treatments. This second advantage also applies to the product to be 
introduced in a self-loading trailer, for which it should 
also be noted that cutting facilitates optimum loading. The main systems currently used to cut forage 
constituted by grass, hay, or straw cause the product, 
pushed by appropriate conveyor elements, to pass in contact 
with fixed blades, but this produces a disadvantageous 
situation both because the cutting device absorbs a 
considerable amount of power, which is required to overcome 
the resistance that the fixed blades offer to the passage of 
the mass of product in a condition that is often on the 
brink of jamming, and because the cutting is actually 
produced by tearing the fibers, thus damaging the integrity 
of the product.  The aim of the present invention is therefore to 
provide a device for gathering and cutting forage and straw 
that requires low installed power levels for its operation 
and furthermore cuts the product in optimum conditions, so 
as to provide maximum protection of the characteristics of 
said product. The proposed aim is achieved by a device for gathering 
and cutting forage and straw, according to the invention, 
comprising a gathering unit that is adapted to lift the 
product from the field to make it available to a rotary 
feeder provided with teeth that are distributed in pairs and 
entrain the product, which rests on a base surface, 
characterized in that there is a blade which is provided 
with a cutting motion, acts in the interspace between the 
two teeth of each pair, and protrudes, at least in the 
active position, from a groove provided in the base surface. Further characteristics and advantages will become 
apparent from the description of some preferred but

<CLAIMS>
Device for gathering and cutting forage and straw, 
comprising a gathering unit that is adapted to lift the 

product from the field to make it available to a rotary 
feeder (8) provided with a plurality of teeth (9,10) that 

are distributed in pairs and entrain the product, which 
rests on a base surface (4), characterized in that there is 

at least one blade (21) which is provided with a cutting 
motion, each one of said at least one blade acts in the 

interspace between the two teeth (9,10) of each pair, and 
protrudes, at least in the active position, from a groove 

(4a) provided in the base surface. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said at least one blade is supported by flexible means (23) 

to lower them from the active position so as to be able to 
recover said position, said means (23) being adapted to move 

said at least one blade (21) from the active position, in 
which they protrude from the base surface, to an inactive 

position, in which said at least one blade is located at a 
level that lies below said surface. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the blades (21) are shaped 

like rotating disks. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the blades (21) are shaped 

like rotating disks with a sharp edge. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the blades (25) are shaped 

like rotating disks with sharp teeth (26). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, comprising two side walls (3,4) for supporting the 

base (4) surface and the rotary feeder (8), characterized in 
that it comprises, for each side wall, a lever (12) which is 

connected to actuation means (13), is pivoted to said side 
at one end (11), and is adapted to support, so that they are 

pivoted at the other end, the frame (16) of the gathering 

unit (17) and a lever (24) for connection to a motorized 
shaft that supports the rotating blades (21), is inserted, 

at its ends, in grooves (2a,3a) formed in the two side walls 
(2,3), and is supported by actuation cylinders (23). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the blades are provided so as 

to form reciprocating cutting edges.
