<ABSTRACT>
A surgical needle (1) for sutural treatment having a 
body (2) triangle or 

polygon in cross section includes a blunt needle 
point (P) with a plate or 

round end and at least two cutting edges (5B,5C) to prevent 
a health provider 

from hurting herself or himself by mistake even if the 
needle (1) contacts the 

tissues of the health provider and to provide a property that once the 
needle (1) enters the tissues the needle (1) passes through the 

tissues smoothly. 
A first face (4A) of the body (2) could be ground by a 

grinding apparatus (20) 
specially made for the surgical needle (1) to form a 

tapered slope and the 
cutting edges (5B,5C). Pressing a material piece of 
the 
needle in a V-shaped 

groove (11) forms second and third faces (4B,4C) and readily produces 
a high quality 

surgical needle (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical needle for a suture and, more
particularly, to a surgical needle having a triangular cross section at its
body and a grinding apparatus for manufacturing the surgical needle.
2. Description of Related ArtAs conventional surgical needles, known are needles such as
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication, No. Showa-62-23,457
and Japanese Patent Publication, No. Heisei-1-54,075.
JP-1195892 discloses a curved suture needle provided with two longitudinal
cutting edges. The needle disclosed has a sharp point.
Any of these surgical needles has a triangular cross section and a pointed body to
reduce resistance against penetration when passed through the tissues.Problems of infections among health providers and patients
involved in infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, AIDS, MRSA
(Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus), and whatever, are raised
as major social problems these days. Such infections may happen by way
of a fluid, such as blood or the like, as a carrier when a health provider, 
such as a doctor or the like, hurts herself or himself by mistake with the
medical instrument. Hence, a needle with a sharp point may hurt a health
provider by herself or himself, and the health provider must pay close
attention to handle the needle since in such situations the health provider
has to take tremendous risks of infection between them, so that the health
provider has to endure enormous mental pressure caused by such risks.It is an object of the invention to provide a safe surgical needle
hardly to hurt a health provider even if the provider handles it in a
wrong manner and thereby to solve the problems happening in
association with medical circumstances these days.The foregoing object is accomplished with a surgical needle having
a triangular cross section at a body and including a face tapered along a
longitudinal direction of the body, a pair of cutting edges provided at
opposite ends of the face in a transverse direction of the body. An edge
provided in opposition to the face is blunted so that the needle point
never enters into tissues unless a predetermined force or above is applied
thereto, thereby blunting a needle point to prevent a health provider
from being hurt by mistake. After pushed into tissues by a certain force,
the surgical needle passes through the tissues with the cutting edges
incising the tissues under reduced resistance against penetration of the
needle.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cutting 
edges are formed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surgical needle (1) having a polygonal cross
section at a body (2 or 2E) thereof, said surgical

needle comprising:

a first face (4A or 14A) tapered along a
longitudinal direction of said body (2 or 2E) so

that said body (2 or 2E) is of thinner thickness
on a tip side thereof than on the opposite side;

and
a pair of cutting edges (5B,5C or 15C,15D)
provided at opposite sides of said first face (4A)

or (14A) in a longitudinal direction of said body
(2 or 2E); and wherein either:


a) a blunt edge (5A) is provided in opposition to
said face (4A), said blunt edge (5A) expanding to

a needle point (P) so that said surgical needle
(1) has no sharp point; or
b) a second face (14B) is provided in opposition
to said first face (14A) and a needle point (P)

formed in a plate shape by and between said first
and second faces (14A, 14B),

with the proviso that when the needle shape is
described by option a) then the cross-section of

the body (2) is triangular.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein at said needle point (P) said cutting

edges (5B, 5C or 15B, 15C) are spaced apart.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein said cutting edges (5B, 5C or 15B, 15C)

meet at a point.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, wherein said first face (4A or 14A)

is ground in a transverse direction perpendicular
to said longitudinal direction.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 4, wherein said body (2 or 2E) has

curvature.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 4, wherein said body (2 or 2E) is

straight.
A surgical needle (1) as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 6, wherein said first face (4A or 14A)

is formed by grinding and other faces (4B, 4C or
14B) of the surgical needle (1) are formed by

press.

(1a) said surgical needle having a polygonal cross

section at said body (2), said apparatus (20)

comprising:

a grinder for grinding in a transverse direction
perpendicular to said longitudinal direction; and
