<ABSTRACT>
The semiconductor integrated circuit enjoys a
high performance and can be produced at a low production

cost and within a short time. A cell has an internal
circuit connection such that an output terminal (22) is

connected to a plurality of input terminals (19 to 21)
through source-drain paths of active devices (M13 to M16)

connected in the tree form, and gate electrodes of the
active devices (M13 to M16) are connected to other input

terminals (15 to 18). Two such cells having the same
internal circuit connection, the same disposition of the

internal circuit devices and the same disposition of the
input/output terminals are disposed on the same chip, and

mutually different logics can be accomplished by changing
the form of application of input signals from outside the

cells to the input terminals. A chip area of an
integrated circuit designed by CAD using a cell library

can be reduced and a high speed circuit operation can be
attained. The present invention provides remarkable

effect for improving performance of an ASIC, a microprocessor,
etc., and for reducing the cost of production.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device and a method of producing the 
same. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to integrated circuit devices such as an application 
specific I.C. (ASIC), a microprocessor, a micro-controller, 
a digital signal processor, etc., and a 
method of efficiently producing them. Systems such as gate arrays, standard cells, 
cell based ICs, etc., have been widely employed in the 
past to accomplish a large-scale logic circuit, in 
particular. A characteristic feature of these integrated 
circuits is that partial circuits referred to as "cells" 
are prepared in advance. The term "cell" means a small scale logic 
circuit such as NAND, NOR, etc., for which layout of a 
mask pattern has already been finished. Generally, the 
positions of input/output terminals and an operation 
speed are determined besides the mask layout. When information on this cell is gathered and 
registered to an auxiliary memory unit of a computer for 
computer aided design, it is referred to as a "cell 
library" (or sometimes "macrocell library", "macro 
library", "device library" and "standard cell library"). If such a cell library for so-called "CAD  
 
(Computer Aided Design)" is in advance prepared, an 
integrated circuit having an intended logic function can 
be accomplished by merely disposing the cells on a chip 
and connecting the terminals of the cells by wirings. 
Accordingly, the integrated circuit having the intended 
logic function can be fabricated within a short time 
because logic design can be carried out without taking a 
circuit operation on a transistor level and layout into 
consideration. A "pass transistor circuit" is another technology 
associated with the present invention. It is 
known that when the pass transistor circuits are used, 
logic such as 2-input AND, OR, exclusive-OR (XOR), etc., 
can be accomplished in a smaller area and at a higher 
speed than ordinary CMOS circuits by using the same 
internal circuit connection and changing the application 
forms of external 2-input signals and their inverted 
2-input signals (that is, two complementary input 
signals). A literature, J. H. Pasternak et al IEEE 
Circuits and Devices, July, 1993, pp. 23-28 and a 
literature K. Yano et al IEEE Journal of Solid-State 
Circuits, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 388-395 (1990) can be cited 
as the references relating to this pass transistor 
circuit. These references describe that in order to 
constitute 3-input OR, AND, XOR, etc., by using the means 
of this
