<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel immunoreagents
and more particularly to targeting radioactive immunoreagents
which find particular utility in therapeutic and diagnostic
imaging compositions and methods. The present invention
further relates to novel complexing agents.Prior to 1980, the targeting of tumor-bearing sites
by radioimmunoglobulin had been demonstrated by a number of
laboratories at different institutions (S.E. Order et al., "Use
of Isotopic Immunoglobulin in Therapy," Cancer Research 40,
3001-7 (August 1980)). By 1980 it was demonstrated that tumors
would concentrate radiolabeled-antibodies to tumor associated
antigens and that radiolabeled reagents employed allowed both
diagnostic imaging of tumors, e.g., by gamma camera imaging
(radioimmunoscintigraphy) and positron tomography, and
therapeutic treatment, i.e., reduction in tumor size by the
targeting radioactive immunoreagent.Early targeting with radiolabeled immunoreagents was
carried out with radioactive iodine. However, as noted by
Scheinberg et al, "Tumor Imaging with Radioactive Metal
Chelates Conjugated to Monoclonal Antibodies," Science 215, No.
19, 1511-13 (March 1982), iodine isotopes pose several
problems, particularly with respect to scanning of tumor
images. Of the three commonly available isotopic forms, only
123I has the appropriate emission characteristics for imaging
and a short enough half-life to be safely used diagnostically.
The gamma radiation of 125I is too weak for imaging. 131I has
often been used but is undesirable because of its long half-life 
and high energy gamma and cytotoxic beta radiations. 131I
has also been used therapeutically for large tumors, but
appears ineffective in the treatment of small tumors.
Moreover, rapid metabolism of radioiodinated antibodies allows
incorporation of the iodine into the thyroid and active
excretion of the iodine by the stomach and urinary tract. This
dispersion of the radioactive iodine hinders imaging of
specific tumors, since the tumors are hidden by background
radiation.In addition to tumor targeting with radioactive
antibodies for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic treatment,
similar targeting has been accomplished for diagnostic imaging
of infarcts, specifically, myocardial infarcts, using
antibodies to canine cardiac myosin [Khaw et al, "Myocardial
Infarct Imaging of Antibodies to Canine Cardiac Myosin Indium
- 111 - Diethylenetriamine Pentaacetic Acid," Science 209,
295-7 (July 1980)], and for imaging atherosclerosis by
targeting atherosclerotic plaques. The same
