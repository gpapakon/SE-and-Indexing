<ABSTRACT>
A system for detecting a fault in a power line (1) includes, in the power line (1), a first circuit (4) capable of attenuating signals within a first frequency band, which is centered on a first frequency, substantially more than it attenuates signals outside the first frequency band, and, a second circuit (5) connected to the power line (1) on one side of the first circuit (4), the second circuit (5) being capable of extracting signals within a second frequency band that includes the first frequency. The relative levels of two signals extracted by the second circuit (5), are detected and signalled, the two signals being at respective frequencies which the first circuit is capable of attenuating by different relative amounts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for detecting a fault in power lines. Electrical power lines which may, for example, 
operate at 400 kV at a frequency of 50 Hz, as in the case 
of the national grid in the United Kingdom, need to be 
protected and it is desirable that a section of the power 
line developing a fault is immediately isolated from the 
remainder of the system. It is important for a fault 
detection system to be able to distinguish between a 
fault inside the protected section, in which case the 
section should be immediately isolated, and a fault 
outside the protected section, in which case the section 
should not be isolated. It is known that high frequency signals are 
generated under fault conditions and there have already 
been proposals to use the high frequency signals as an 
indication of a fault condition. Such proposals have 
not, however, been entirely satisfactory. One such proposal is known from EP-A-318274, from which the preamble of present claims 1, 2, 14 and 15 have been derived and which 
discloses a method and an apparatus for detecting a fault 
in a power line. That document discloses apparatus 
comprising means for, and a method for, determining 
whether a fault has occurred forward or reverse of a 
predetermined point, by comparing the magnitude of high-frequency 
signals at the same frequency on either side of an 
attenuating circuit in the power line.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide 
improved methods and apparatus for detecting a fault in a 
power line. The invention provides a method of detecting a fault 
in a power line including the steps of: 
providing, in the power line, a first circuit 
capable of attenuating signals within a first frequency 
band, which frequency band is centred on a first 
frequency, substantially more than signals outside the 
first frequency band, providing a second circuit connected to the power 
line and being capable of extracting signals within a 
second frequency band that includes the first frequency, 
and detecting and signalling the relative levels of two 
signals extracted by the second circuit, the relative levels of which two 
signals, when a fault is detected in the power line, are 
used to ascertain in which direction relative to the 
first circuit the fault is, characterised in that the second circuit is connected to the power line on 
one side of the first circuit and the two signals are at 
respective frequencies one of which two signals is capable 
of being attenuated by the first circuit
