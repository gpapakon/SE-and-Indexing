<ABSTRACT>
Method for low-pressure casting in which use is made of a mould (5) intended for casting a component, a leaktight smelting furnace (1), a tube (4) immersed in a crucible (3) of the furnace (1) and emerging in the mould (5), a bell (35) covering over the mould (5), means for injecting a pressurised fluid into the furnace (1) and for creating a vacuum over the furnace and the bell, characterised in that it consists in forming a vacuum in the furnace and the bell then in injecting a gas into the furnace and in measuring the difference in pressure between the furnace and the mould, then the bell, in measuring the depth of the metal in the crucible at any moment and the temperature of the metal at the entry of the mould and in automatically controlling the furnace/mould or furnace/bell pressure difference, in observing the predetermined values by taking account of the depth of the metal in the crucible and the temperature of the metal on entry into the mould. The method applies essentially to the casting of components made from metal alloys, including aluminium and magnesium, to the impregnation of fibre preforms using a metal alloy, and to the casting of organic polymers.

A process of low pressure pouring into a mould under vacuum, more
particularly intended for the production of parts having thin portions, from a crucible

placed in a furnace, of the type comprising the steps of: communicating the mould
and the furnace under one vacuum; introducing the metal into the mould by

pressurising the furnace; once filling is complete, bringing the mould and the furnace
down to pressure values higher than, or equal to, the atmospheric pressure, the mould

pressure remaining higher than the furnace pressure; and maintaining these pressure
values during the cooling and solidification of the 
metal; and finally depressurising
the furnace to bring it back to the atmospheric pressure,

   characterised in that the variations of the metal velocity and pressure at any
point inside the mould are controlled from the origin to predetermined values based

on the amount of metal in the crucible at the origin and throughout the cycle.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the amount of metal is
taken as a function of the metal height in the crucible.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the
variations of the metal velocity and pressure at any point inside the mould are

controlled from the origin to predetermined values based on the temperature of the
metal at the mould inlet.
A process according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the
mould and the crucible are placed inside two separate chambers and in that both

chambers are brought to the same pressure or vacuum level, wherein said level can
be the atmospheric pressure level, then a pressure difference is created between the

two chambers so that the metal is introduced into the mould, a pressurisation is
established once filling is complete, and the two chambers are brought to final

pressure values and maintained at these values during solidification, then they are
depressurised.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
cooling and solidification of the metal is controlled by injection of liquid nitrogen at

predetermined locations into the mould.
A device for practising the process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
comprising a crucible (3) placed in a tight furnace (1a); a mould placed under a bell

(35), the furnace and the bell being connected to a vacuum pump (47) via pipes fitted
with isolating solenoid valves (37, 40); and communication means between the

furnace and the mould,
 
   characterised in that it further comprises means for continuously determining

the amount of metal, said means being coupled to a pilot device (15) that applies a
pressure profile inside the furnace in order to create the predetermined velocity and

pressure conditions inside the mould.
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the means for
determining the amount of metal in the crucible comprise a slewable lever (11)

carrying at its end a removable float (10) for positioning on the free surface of the
metal and fitted with a toothed sector (13) moving in contact with a gear mechanism

(14) driven by a motor, and connected to a rotation sensor associated to said pilot
device (15).
A device according to claim 6 or claim 7, characterised in that the
communications means between the furnace and the mould comprise a tube and a

nozzle forming an integral member, said nozzle being electrically heated and
controlled to have the predetermined temperature defined in the casting parameters

for the part.
A device according to claim 8, characterised in that the nozzle is fitted with
a sensor for detecting the passage of the metal, comprising a tube (60) closed by

means of a cap (61) on which the end of a thermocouple (62) is fastened, the tube
having one air inlet (63) and one air escape (65) for cooling the cap before a pouring

cycle is started so that it is maintained at a predetermined temperature.
A device according to claim 8, characterised in that the nozzle is fitted with
a chamber into which a protective gas is injected for protecting the metal in the tube

and fitted at its upper part with sealing rings cooled by a chamber with air circulation
located inside the upper flange of the nozzle.
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the
pilot device (15) performs the control by operating a proportional valve fitted on the

air inlet and analyses the data from the sensor in order to detect the passage of the
metal by the thermal shock produced on the cap carrying the thermocouple.
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 10, characterised in that, for
pouring magnesium alloys, the heating elements are placed in refractory steel tubes

having an internal volume which is at the atmospheric pressure or at a pressure
different from the furnace pressure and being dimensioned to withstand at 900 °C the

positive or negative pressures that exist in the furnace.
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 11, characterised in that the

products, capable of withstanding the aggression of CO
