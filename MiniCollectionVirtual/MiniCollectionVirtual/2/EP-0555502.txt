<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a positioning device 
in sewing machines for closing the toe of socks or the like. 

The device comprises a pair of laminae (2a,2b) which are 
arranged mutually adjacent so as to define, between them, a 

passage (3) in which a portion (11) of the sock, which is 
arranged proximate to the toe of the sock and is thinner at 

least with respect to a border (10) which delimits this 
portion on the sock body side, is inserted. The sock is 

arranged between the laminae so that one free end (12) of 
the toe to be closed protrudes from one side of the pair of 

laminae and so that the body (4a) of the sock protrudes from 
the opposite side. The device comprises tension application 

means (14a,14b) which can engage the free end of the toe and 
cooperate with the laminae in order to position the border, 

which delimits the thinner portion on the sock body side, 
against the side (23) of the laminae which is directed 

toward the sock body during the advancement of the sock 
along the passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positioning device 
in sewing machines for closing the toe of socks or the like, 
as defined in the preamble of the appended claim 1 and as 
disclosed for example in DE-A-2 420 167. As is known, socks, men's socks in particular, are 
generally manufactured with circular machines which form a 
semiworked tubular product which is shaped like a sock and 
is open at the toe. This product is then subjected to a 
finishing operation which consists in closing the toe by 
darning or by so-called "blind" mechanical sewing. In the darning operation, the loops at the open toe of 
the sock are arranged manually, one by one, on appropriate 
pins of the darning machine which are then affected by an 
extremely accurate sewing which joins the various loops to 
one another. Sewing performed with darning machines can be 
likened to the creation of a row of knitting whose loops 
join the loops of the toe of the sock. The finish obtained 
with the darning operation is very good, since the loop 
joining line is scarcely detectable not only visually but 
also to the touch. Although it provides a very good final result, darning 
has the problem that it requires relatively long execution 
times and thus significantly affects the costs of the 
finished product. Due to this reason, darned socks are the 
best-finished and most sought-after socks, but are also the 
most expensive. Finishing by blind sewing is considerably faster in 
execution, since the flaps of the open toe of the sock are 
merely arranged manually mutually adjacent and are fed to a 
sewing machine which joins them by means of one or more  
 
sewings. Naturally, blind sewing is not as precise as 
darning, and the degree of finish is significantly lower. However, finishing by blind sewing has the advantage, 
with respect to darning, that it requires significantly 
shorter execution times and thus allows to manufacture 
finished socks with considerably lower costs. Through the years, sewing machines for finishing socks 
have been the subject of various improvements aimed at 
providing better finish quality. These improvements have 
generally affected the sewing devices and the methods for 
performing the sewing, whereas the positioning of the sock 
on the machine has always been entrusted to the skill and 
experience of the operator. More particularly, sewing machines for finishing socks 
currently in use are provided, at their inlet, with a pair 
of laminae which are arranged mutually adjacent so as to 
define, between them, a

<CLAIMS>
Positioning device in sewing machines for closing 
the toe of socks or the like, comprising a pair of laminae 

(2a,2b) which are arranged mutually adjacent so as to 
define, between them, a passage (3) for the insertion of a 

portion (11) of a sock (4), arranged proximate to the toe to 
be closed, which is thinner at least than a border (10) 

which delimits said portion on the sock body (4a) side, in 
order to position said sock so that one free end (12) of the 

toe to be closed protrudes from one side of said pair of 
laminae and so that the body (4a) of the sock protrudes from 

the opposite side, characterized in that it comprises 
tension application means (14a,14b) which can engage said 

free end of the toe to gradually lift said free end of the 
toe away from the side of said laminae which is directed 

away from said sock body and cooperate with said laminae 
(2a,2b) in order to position said border (10), which 

delimits said thinner portion (11) on the sock body (4a) 
side, against the side (23) of said laminae which is 

directed toward said sock body (4a) during the advancement 
of the sock along said passage (3).  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said laminae (2a,2b) are co-planar at least proximate to 

said passage (3), said tension application means comprising 
a device fitted with clamps (14a,14b) which can move along 

an advancement direction which follows the extension of the 
passage (3) defined by said laminae (2a,2b), said clamp-fitted 

device facing the side of said laminae which supports 
said free end (12) of the toe of the sock, said advancement 

direction being inclined with respect to the plane of 
arrangement of said laminae in order to progressively space  

 
said clamps (14a,14b), which engage said free end of the toe 

of the sock, from the plane of arrangement of said laminae 
during advancement along said passage. 
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that said clamp-fitted device comprises a pair of chains 

(14a,14b) two arms of which face one another at said passage 
(3), each of said chains having links provided with teeth 

(17) which engage the teeth of the links of the other chain 
along the two mutually facing arms in order to engage the 

free end (11) of the toe of the sock inserted in said 
passage (3). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said chains (14a,14b) wind 

around two pairs of counter-rotating pinions 
(15a,15b,16a,16b) which are arranged in a plane which faces 

said laminae (2a,2b) and is inclined with respect to the 
plane of arrangement of said laminae. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 

claims, characterized in that it comprises means (19,20) for 
adjusting the inclination of said advancement direction of 

the clamp-fitted device with respect to the plane of 
arrangement of said laminae. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises a block (18) 

which supports said pinions (15a,15b,16a,16b) and is pivoted 
to said laminae about an axis (19) which is arranged 

transversely to said advancement direction (5) in order to 
allow oscillation for the adjustment of the inclination of 

said block (18) with respect to the plane of arrangement of 
said laminae (2a,2b), the inclination of said block being  

 
variable by means of a screw (20) which is associated with 

said block in a position which is spaced from its pivoting 
axis (19) and rests on an abutment (7) which is rigidly 

associated with said laminae (2a,2b). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at least one portion (23) of 

said laminae which delimits said passage (3), at said 
tension application means, extends for a certain portion 

away from said tension application means along said 
advancement direction (5). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises means (24-29) for 

adjusting the mutual distance of said laminae in order to
