<ABSTRACT>
A buckling beam test probe assembly for the electrical test of 
devices is provided having contact probes (4) made of a composite 

material (7,9) and a stripper plate (3) constructed so as to allow a 
controllable wiping of each contact probe on the surface (2) of the 

device to be tested. 
The assembly is designed for the maximum number of contact probes 
expected. Only those contact probe compartments are populated which are 

needed for testing the respective device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a test probe assembly
for the electrical test of devices. More particularly, the
present invention refers to test probe assemblies for testing
IC's having a very high contact density, i.e., a very high
number of contact points to be tested.For the electrical test on wafer level today mainly so called
needle or membrane cards are used. The needle cards consist
of a number of radially arranged resilient needles which
correspond to the test points on the IC to be contacted.
Contact on the IC is made by means of these needles.For each contact pattern of the IC pads the cards have to be
manufactured seperately. Depending on the number of needles,
different designs are necessary. If, e.g., about 300 needles
must be used to test a device, it is necessary to arrange
these needles in up to three levels, since only a specific
number of needles can be arranged in one ring. Adjusting the
needles in their three axes involves much manual work due to
an accuracy requirement of the needle tips of about 5 Âµm.
Additionally, the needles are very sensitive with respect to
damage and disadjustment, since they are not mechanically
guided over a relatively long distance.
Increasing contact density and contact quantity, required by
new IC generations, more and more limit the use of needle
cards. It is not possible to cover the whole area of a test
card with contact needles. The same applies for so called
membrane cards which are being developed at present. Although
it is possible to create ICs having a very dense arrangement
of contact pads, no adequate system for testing such ICs
exists at present.Commencing with the late 1980s, buckling beam test probe
assemblies have been developed. European patent 165331
describes a contact probe arrangement for electrically 
connecting a test system with the contact pads of a device to
be tested, where wires of electrically highly conductive,
resilient material are used as contact probes. These contact
probes are placed onto the contact pads of the device to be
tested and put under axial stress for achieving a low contact
resistance, with the probes buckling laterally. This lateral
buckling is advantageous since it provides a means to adapt
to the irregularities in the surface of the device to be
tested. The buckling contact probes adapt to different
heights of the contact pads.In US-A-4,901,013 there is described an apparatus for testing
of electrical circuits having a buckling beam probe assembly
with advantageous features that make it useful for

<CLAIMS>
A buckling beam test probe assembly for electrically
testing a device, provided with a plurality of contact

pads, comprising

current carrying electrically conductive contact probes
(4), each of said probes is made of a composite

material including an inner core (7) surrounded by an
outer sheath (9), said core is comprising a resilient

material and a plurality of fibers, said sheath is
comprising a highly electrical conductive material, and

said fibers are protruding from said core ;
a stack of perforated plates (1), wherein each of said
probes passes through one perforation in each of said

perforated plates; and
a stripper plate (3) positioned under said perforated
plates, said stripper plate is comprised of an upper

guiding channels in the lower section are offset with

respect to those in the upper section so that when an
axial force is applied to said probes passing through

said guiding channels said probes are deflected
laterally by an amount determined by said offset and by

the diameter of said channels, thereby providing each
