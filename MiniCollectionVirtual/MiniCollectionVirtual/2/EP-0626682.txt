<ABSTRACT>
In a record medium wherein information is recorded 
and/or erased by changing the optical state thermally by the 

irradiation with a laser beam or the like, a protection layer 
made from a material having a larger thermal conductivity than 

adjacent protection layers is used to decrease the temperature 
difference between the center and edges of a record mark on 

recording and/or erasing with a laser beam. By using the 
material having a larger thermal conductivity, the heat due 

to the irradiation with a laser beam or the like is diffused 
not only to the periphery of the substrate, but also to the 

plane of the substrate surely. Therefore, the temperature 
difference between the center and the edges in a mark on 

irradiation with the laser beam is decreased, and the recording/erasing 
characteristics and the power margin for erasing 

can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical record
medium which can record or erase information of a large
capacity at a high density with use of a laser beam or the
like.A write-once type disk is known as an optical record
memory, and it comprises a material which can transform from
the crystalline phase to the amorphous phase such as TeOx (0
< x < 2.0) having Te and TeO2 as main components. In such an
optical record memory, a data is written thermally by
irradiating the optical disk with a laser beam or the like.Further, a write erasable disk wherein information
can be recorded and erased repeatedly has also been used
practically as an optical record memory. Such a write
erasable disk can record information by changing a mark point
in a record thin film to the amorphous state with a laser beam
to heat, melt and cool rapidly the record thin film, while it
can erase information by changing a mark point in the record
thin film to the crystalline state with a laser beam to heat
and cool gradually the record thin film. Materials which can 
transform reversibly between the crystalline phase and the
amorphous state are used for such a record thin film, and they
include a chalcogenide material Ge15Te81S2 by S. R. Ovshinsky
and the like, and As2S3, As2Se3, Sb2Se3 and the like which are
combinations of a chalcogen element with another element in
group V such as As or in group IV such as Ge in the periodic
table. An optical disk can be produced by forming such a
record thin film on a substrate having grooves for guiding a
laser beam. In order to record or erase information in such
an optical disk with a laser beam, the record thin film is
crystallized at first. Then, the intensity of a laser beam
focussed at diameter of about 0.5 µm on the rotated disk is
modulated for irradiation in correspondence to information,
so that the temperature of a point irradiated with the laser
beam at a peak power is increased above the melting point of
the record thin film and is cooled rapidly. Thus, the
information is recorded as an amorphous mark. Further, the
temperature of a point irradiated at a bias peak power rises
above the crystallization temperature of the record thin film,
so that the information recorded previously can be erased or
an overwrite is possible.As explained above, the temperature of the record
thin film can be risen with a laser beam above the melting
point or above the crystallization point. Therefore, heat-resistant
dielectric layers are generally provided above and 
below the record thin film as
