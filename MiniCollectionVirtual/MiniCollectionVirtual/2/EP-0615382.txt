<ABSTRACT>
In order to reproduce auxiliary data containing important 
information easily and at high speed, auxiliary data are 

composed of data of fixed length assigned at the beginning of a block. 
In order to record the signal so that important 

information may be reproduced securely without increasing the 
recording rate, a dummy sync block is inserted immediately before a 

data sync block which contains important information 
defining or explaining the content of the 

signal to be recorded. To keep the error correction capability 
in normal play, moreover, the same sync block composition 

as that of the signal to be recorded is used for the auxiliary 
data. By assigning important information in plural sync blocks, 

reproduction is guaranteed securely also in the case of trick play.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus of recording
on a recording medium auxiliary data while recording
digital video signals and/or audio signals.When recording and reproducing video signal and audio
signal, it is necessary to simultaneously record and reproduce
auxiliary data for explaining what the signal is, aside
from the signal itself. The auxiliary data includes, for
example, the information telling whether the video signal is
of 50 Hz system or of 60 Hz system, the information of the
number of samples of audio signals assigned in a block
composed in synchronizing with the video signal, and other
information that, if once lost, makes it impossible to
reproduce the entire signal. As a conventional digital 
signal recording system, a digital audio tape-recording
system (DAT) for recording only audio signals may be listed.
In DAT, tracks formed on a magnetic tape are divided into
main areas for recording audio signals, and sub area 1 and
sub area 2 as regions for recording other information, by
means of IBG (inter block gap) which is a buffer region for
editing. The auxiliary data is divided and recorded into a
main ID which is a block address of main data block for
composing the main area, and sub ID of sub data which is a
block address of sub data block for composing the sub area.In such recording method, however, since the error
correction code for auxiliary data is set only for the one
lower in capacity than the error correction code for the
audio signal, the error correction capacity can be guaranteed
only by recording repeatedly. Besides, when the audio
signal and auxiliary data are recorded in different regions,
the necessary auxiliary data may be lost by mistake in the
case of editing or the like.Furthermore, when recording audio signals, auxiliary
data may be assigned in the block address, but when a video 
signal is recorded by employing a similar recording method,
since the quantity of information to be recorded is enormous,
it is difficult to heighten the recording rate further
by repeatedly recording into the block address. When recording
an audio signal, meanwhile, it is not necessary to
consider the output of data in trick play, but when a video
signal is recorded by employing a similar recording method,
a trick play is an indispensable function. The particularly
important data in auxiliary data in trick play must be
protected from scratch of magnetic tape, error due to long
burst, or synchronous block detection error.A method of recording audio and video data in one track
is
