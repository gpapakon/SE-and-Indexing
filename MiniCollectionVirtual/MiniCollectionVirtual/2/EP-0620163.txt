<ABSTRACT>
In a closure for an evaporating device onto which a bottle (60), container or the like can be screwed by means of a receiving part (12), the receiving part has a central opening (14) to pass a wick-shaped element or the like through. The receiving part forms a bottom (16) on which tooth-like projections (18) are arranged in a distributed manner. A closure part (30) inserted into the receiving part has an internal thread which has on its outer surface catch elements which can be brought into engagement with the projections of the receiving part. Provided between the receiving part and the closure part is a spring device which prestresses the receiving part and the closure part with axial spacing from one another. The closure part is provided with a central opening (32) which fixes an annular edge (34). Teeth (35) directed towards the centre of the closure part are moulded onto the annular edge. Formed on the bottom of the receiving part is an annular flange (24) extending concentrically relative to the axis of the receiving part. The teeth of the closure part and the annular flange form the spring device.
