NOVEL SUBSTITUTED OXONICOTINATES, THEIR USE
AS PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS AND PLANT GROWTH
 REGULATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM
 This invention concerns novel substituted oxonicotinates and their use as plant growth regulators, particularly as chemical sterilants for producing hybrid seeds of monocotyledonous crop plants, for plant breeding purposes or for the agricultural production of ergot; also concerned are plant growth regulating compositions.


 The use of chemical sterilants for the production of new cereal grains is a rapidly expanding technology.


Cereal grain such as maize, wheat, rice, rye, barley, millet, sorghum, triticale and various   monocotyledbnous    forage crops are the main areas where research has been undertaken to improve both the productivity and the food value of these crops. The utilization of chemical hybridization agents in this research makes possible the nyhridization of cereal grain crops on economical scale. Patents which pertain to this technology include U.S. Patent Nos. 3,761,240, 3,838,155 and 3,5Z6,814 which disclose N-aryl-2-oxonicotinates as male sterilants and plant growth regulators. Also   U;S.    Patent
Nos. 4,115,101, 4,051,142 and German Offen. 2,830,700 disclose the use of N-aryl-4-oxonicotinate and
N-aryl-6-oxonicotinates as male sterilants.


 A. Selva and A. Gennaro describe in Organic Mass
Spectrometry, Vol.ll, pp 117-120 (1976) the mass spectrometry data for the compound 2-phenyl-6-methyl-3carbethoxy-4-pyridone. No biological activity is disclosed for this compound.


 Balogh et al., J.Het.Chem., i7, 359 (1980), disclose the synthesis of various 5-substituted (including  5-phenyl)   1-alkyl-4-oxo-1 , 4-dihydri-3-pyridine    carboxylic acid derivatives for   antimicronial    studies.


 R. Johnstone et al., Aust. J.Chem. 11, 562 (1958) (Chem. Abs., 53, 5310d (1957)) disclose l-methyl6-phenyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxylic acid as a decarboxylation product of a quinolone compound.


 T. Kametani et   al.,.J.      Het.    Chem. 14, 477 (1977) disclose the synthesis of various 1,4-dihydro-4oxonicotinic acid derivatives, some of which bear a 6-phenyl group, which compounds have antibacterial properties.


 Wick et al., Ger. Offen. 2,901,868 (Chem.Abs., 91 , 211273h (1979) disclose 4-pyridone-3-carboxylic acid derivatives, for example, the 6-phenyl derivative thereof, which possess bactericidal and central nervous system   stimulant    properties.
