<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAMINES IN THE TREATMENT OF ARRHYTHMIAThis invention relates to a novel treatment and in particular to a novel treatment for arrhythmia and to certain novel compounds and compositions used in such treatment .Antiarrhythmic drugs have been grouped according to the pattern of electrophysiological effects they produce and/or their presumed mechanism of action. A classification in four groups has been originally proposed by Naughan Williams in 1970. At the molecular level, class I compounds act on Νa+ currents; class II compounds possess b-adrenoceptor blocking activity; class III drugs block K+ channels; and class IN drugs target Ca++ channels.European Patent Application, Publication Number 0233762 discloses compounds of formula (I) therein which are stated to have cardiovascular activity, including use in the treatment of angina. It has now surprisingly been discovered that certain compounds of formula (I) of EP0233762 show potential as antiarrhythmic agents: This antiarrhythmic activity is considered to be associated with an increase in the QT interval.Certain of the compounds of formula (I) surprisingly evidenced a prolongation of the cardiac action potential and are therefore considered to show particular promise as class HI antiarrhythmic agents.Most surprisingly however, certain of the compounds of formula (I) of EP0233762 demonstrated both class III and class IV activity, the class IN activity providing the compounds with a self limiting increase of the cardiac cell action potential duration. These compounds therefore show an improved profile over pure class HI agents, having less proarrhythmic potential, and also a lack of cardiodepressive activity in ischaemic myocardium. These compounds are also considered to be effective against atrial fibrillation and flutter.One compound in particular demonstrates such dual activity, this is the compound of Example 50 of EP-A-8603765 named as (Ν-[3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl]- N-S-pST'^- S^-dimethoxypheny^-ethyl-N'-methylaminolpropy -N'-^ nitrobenzamide, (also referred to herein as 'Compound I').Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of arrhythmia in human or non-human mammals, which method comprises the administration of an effective, non-toxic amount of a compound of formula (I):R,-N— A— N— B— R4(I) 

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, wherein Ri and R are independently phenyl optionally substituted by one, two or three of halogen, C1-4 alkoxy, C1-4 alkyl, cyano,
