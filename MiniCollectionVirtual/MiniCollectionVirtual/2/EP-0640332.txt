<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a package for containing a wound dressing, 
the package comprising a first web and a second web 

hermetically sealed together around their peripheries, the 
inside of the package being sterile, wherein the first and 

second webs include transparent areas which can be 
superimposed and wherein the internal surface of one of the 

transparent areas is receptive to marking. 
Alternatively, the first web comprises at least two layers 
which are releasably held together; the inner and outer 

layers of the first web are transparent; and the outer 
surface of the outer layer of the first web is receptive to 

marking. 
There is also provided a method for recording the area of a 
wound which comprises: providing a package as described 

above; opening the package; folding one web onto the other 
web so that the outer surfaces of the webs are in contact 

and the transparent areas are superimposed; placing the 
folded package on the wound with the markable surface remote 

from the wound; and marking on the markable surface an 
outline of the wound. 
Alternatively, the method comprises: providing an 
alternative wound dressing package as described above; 

opening the package; placing the first web on the wound with 
the markable surface remote from the wound; and marking on 

the markable area an outline of the wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package for a wound
dressing and to a method for measuring the area of a wound.In order to treat wounds, such as cuts, surgical incisions,
ulcers and burns, it is generally necessary to apply a
dressing to the wound. The dressing serves a number of
purposes, one of which is to reduce the risk of the wound
becoming infected.In order to ensure that the dressing itself does not cause
wound infection, dressings are generally provided in
packaging impermeable to microbes. The dressing and package
are sterilised after sealing the package. After
transportation to the point of use of the dressing, the
inside of the package will still be sterile but the outside
of the package will have become contaminated.It is desirable to be able to monitor the progress of the
wound healing process. For instance, the need for wound
measurement is referred to in Clinica, 559, 17, 1993. One
of the easiest ways to do this is to record details of the
wound from time to time. The record may be a picture of the
shape of the wound, an estimate of its diameter or an
estimate of its area. Each time a record of the wound is
made, a note needs to be placed in the patient's record so
that a physician can determine whether the wound healing
process is progressing at a satisfactory rate.There are presently available a number of devices which can
be used to provide a record of a wound. However, these all
suffer from various disadvantages.A wound measurer was made available by the monthly
publication Professional Nurse. The wound measurer
comprises a sheet of transparent plastic having marked on
one edge a scale in centimeters and in the middle a series 
of concentric circles of indicated diameter. In order to
use this measurer, it is necessary for the user to cleanse
one surface to render it sterile. The measurer is then
placed with the sterile surface on the wound and an estimate
of the diameter of the wound is made. This is then manually
entered in the patient's record.It is disadvantageous to have to cleanse the measurer each
time it is used. Also the measurer does not give any idea
of the shape of the wound and cannot be placed in the
patient's record without being cleansed again.A wound grid has been used in clinical trials. This
comprises a sheet of transparent polyvinyl chloride having
a grid of 1 cm squares marked on it. The sheet may also
have marked on it areas for recording the patient's name and
the date the measurement took place. The sheet is provided
in sterile form in a package. In use, the

<CLAIMS>
A package for containing a wound dressing, the package
comprising a first web(1) and a second web(2) hermetically

sealed together around their peripheries, the inside of the
package being sterile, characterized in that the first and

second webs(1,2) include transparent areas which can be
superimposed and wherein the internal surface of one of the

transparent areas is receptive to marking.
A package for containing a wound dressing, the package
comprising a first web(20) and a second web(21) hermetically

sealed together around their peripheries, the inside of the
package being sterile, characterized in that the first web

comprises at least two layers (20a,20b) which are releasably
held together; the inner and outer layers(20a,20b) of the

first web(20) include transparent areas; and the outer
surface of the outer layer of the first web(20) is receptive

to marking.
The package of claim 1 wherein the first and second
webs(1,2) are formed form a single sheet of material.
The package of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the first
and second webs(1,2,20,21) are made from separate sheets of

the same or different materials.
The package of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the
markable area is at least as large in area as the dressing

to be contained in the package.
The package of claim 1 or any claim dependent thereon
wherein both the first and second webs(1,2) are completely

transparent, except for any product or use information which
may be printed on them.
The package of claim 1 or any claim dependent thereon
wherein one or both of the webs(1,2) are opaque or printed

around the periphery and have a transparent window. 
The package of claim 2 or any claim dependent thereon
wherein the two layers(20a,20b) in the first web(20) are

held together by electrostatic forces.
The package of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
markable area has printed on it a grid pattern.
The package of any one of claims 1 to 9 wherein the
web including the markable area has printed on or around the

by the user.
The package of any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the
webs(1,2,20,21) are made from sterilisable plastics.
