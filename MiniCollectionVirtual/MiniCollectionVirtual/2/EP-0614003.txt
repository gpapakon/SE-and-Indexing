<ABSTRACT>
During the transition from overrun after overrun cut-off and vice versa, injection is not stopped and resumed abruptly but is stopped and resumed to each cylinder selectively in accordance with masking patterns stored in a memory. This gives gentle transitions and no torque jumps occur.

Method for controlling the fuel supply to an 
internal combustion engine (10) 


with a plurality of cylinders (Z1-Z4) and successive 
injections into the cylinders in a predetermined 

sequence in the overrun operation range, 
operating parameters (DKW,n) of the internal 
combustion engine being detected and the beginning 

and end of overrun operation being detected when 
these operating parameters meet particular 

conditions, 
the fuel supply to the cylinders (Z1-Z4) being 
reduced in accordance with a selectable function 

when overrun begins and being released again in 
accordance with a selectable function at the end of 

overrun, 
once overrun operation has been detected the 
in
jections for individual cylinders (Z1-Z4) being 
suppressed in a predetermined sequence and 
once the end of overrun has been detected the 
injections for individual cylinders (Z1-Z4) 

restarting in another predetermined sequence, 
the sequences being determined by a temporal 
sequence of individual masking patterns (A-P) stored 

in a memory of an electronic control device (20), 
 
characterized in that when a change in the operating 

state of the internal combustion engine (10) occurs 
during the processing of a sequence of masking patterns 

(A-P), the current masking pattern (A-P) is not continued 
to the end but, instead, once the change in the operating  

 
state has been detected, the current masking pattern 

(A-P) and the sequence of masking patterns (A-P) are then 
run through backwards. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the masking patterns (A-P) are determined as a 

function of the respective speed (n) applied or of the 
speed gradient of the internal combustion engine (10). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the masking patterns (A-P) are determined as a 

function of the respective throttle-valve angle (DKW) 
applied or of its gradient. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the processing of a sequence of masking patterns 

(A-P) is started independently of the cylinder numbering 
(Z1-Z2) when the criteria for overrun detection or the 

end of overrun are met.
