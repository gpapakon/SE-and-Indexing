<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a management network with
at least one managing system and at least one managed system for
telecom or open systems, in which said managed system includes
physical and/or logical resources, which by the managing system
are considered and managed as managed objects in the form of data
images of the resources, and in which the managing system for its
operations directed towards the managed system utilizes an information
model of the managed system, which includes a description
of all managed objects adapted to the mode of operation of
the managing system.With a "management network with at least one managing system
and at least one managed system" is meant that the management
network can include at least one managing system which can manage
one or more managed systems, which likewise can form part of the
management network.With an open system is meant a system of the kind, which is
defined in Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
for CCITT Applications, Rec. X.123.To perform management activities in a management domain
there must be at least one manager which is responsible for the
management of the resources. A resource is something which includes
concepts and ability of the domain. An example of a domain
is a telecom network, where the resources are switches, trunks
etc. and management units are e.g. operator tools and managing
systems for the network.For operation of telephone networks each individual company
has used a number of different systems for operation and
maintenance. CCITT has developed a standard model for operation 
and maintenance. CCITT has developed a standard model for
operation and maintenance in telephone networks, called TMN
(Telecommunication Management Networks). The basic principle
of TMN is to indicate an organised network structure, which
admits connection of various managing systems to telecom
equipment. This is achieved by use of standardised protocols
and interfaces. The telephone companies and other operators
will require that future telecom networks are adapted to TMN.CCITT has a recommendation for this under developement,
the M.3000-serie.TMN considers all network nodes as network elements (NE).
These network elements are made as telephone switches and
transmission or transport network products.The functional structure of TMN comprises
management functions (OSF, Operations Support Functions),
which manage application programmes available for
users, such as management functions for "Business Management"
and service and network
