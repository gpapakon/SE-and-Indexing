<ABSTRACT>
The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or copolymer thereof 
used to produce one-piece intraocular lenses is modified 

by a compression molding process to produce a much tougher 
material with improved mechanical properties. The process 

takes material in rod form and compresses into lens 
blanks. The molded lens blanks receive little or no 

compression strain in the center 4 mm optic zone. The 
compression is limited to the periphery region outside the 

center 4 mm zone. The intraocular lens fabricated from 
the molded lens blank exhibits greatly increased haptic 

mechanical properties and resistance to breakage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved intraocular lens for
implantation in the eye following removal of the natural
lens during cataract surgery. More specifically, it
relates to a compression molding process for manufacturing
an intraocular lens in which the supporting haptics
exhibit an increased resistance to breakage during
manipulation.The filamentary haptic of an intraocular lens is designed
to facilitate insertion of the lens into the eye and to
provide stable fixation of the implanted lens to prevent
the lens from decentering. The filamentary haptic is
attached to and extends outwardly from the periphery of
the optical lens body. Most intraocular lenses have two
haptics displayed at positions 180Â° apart from each other
on the optic lens body.Intraocular lenses are typically of two types: the three-piece
lens where two haptics are mechanically fixed to the
lens optic, and the one-piece lens where the haptics and
optic are made as a single unit.It is critical that the haptic of the lens exhibits
significant resistance to breakage during use. Although
certain haptic materials such as polypropylene used in
construction of a three-piece lens offer acceptable
resistance to breakage, other conventionally used haptic
materials such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) are
brittle and frequently prone to breakage. This problem
becomes especially acute when the haptics are lathe cut 
from a single lens blank to prepare a one-piece lens with
integrally attached haptics. The problem of haptic
breakage is a serious one, and efforts have been made to
provide the haptics with an increased resistance to
breakage.Several thermoplastic forming techniques have been used to
induce orientation in the material to impart enhanced
mechanical properties in PMMA intraocular lens haptics.
One such effort is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,169,569,
showing an intraocular lens according to preamble of claim 1.
This patent describes preparing intraocular lenses with
haptics exhibiting greater ductility and fatigue
resistance. The PMMA sheet plastic is modified by means
of blowing the sheet into a hemispherical bubble followed
by forming into a flattened circular portion.A second effort is disclosed in European Patent
Application 0 438 043 A2. The PMMA material is modified
by multi-axis stretching to produce haptics with increased
tensile strength, flexibility and resiliency.Another previous method of making intraocular lenses was
through a compression molding process which introduced
deformation, and thus material orientation,
