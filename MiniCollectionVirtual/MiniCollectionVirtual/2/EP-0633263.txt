<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a thiophene derivative. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a process for producing a
thiophene derivative useful for an intermediate of biotin
(vitamin H).There has been known heretofore a process for
producing a thiophene as expressed by the general formula
(2):

as disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) No. Sho
61-151194. This process uses palladium oxide as a palladium
catalyst.However, the above process has a disadvantage of
requiring a great amount of the expensive palladium catalyst
for the production of the compounds expressed by the general
formula (2) owing to a low catalytic activity in the process. Chem. Abs. 81: 152223k discloses the preparation of
alkylthiophane derivatives by catalytically reducing
alkylidenethiophanes with e.g. palladium oxide (PdO).FR-A-2 358 407 discloses a process for the preparation of
thiophene derivaties by catalytically hydrogenating a compound
of formulae (II)

or (III)

by using as a catalyst i.a an organic solvent-soluble palladium
compound in an organic solvent. An object of the present invention is to provide a
process for producing a thiophene derivative (2)
advantageous in industry in that the amount of the expensive
palladium catalyst to be used can be reduced to a great
extent.That is, the present invention provides a process
for producing a thiophene derivative expressed by the
general formula (2):

wherein R1 and R2 represent independently hydrogen, an alkyl
group, a phenyl group which may be substituted with a C1 to C6
alkyl group, C1 to C6 alkoxy group or halogen atom, an acyl
group selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl and valeryl, an
alkenylmethyl group, or a benzyl group which may be substituted
with a C1 to C6 alkyl group, C1 to C6 alkoxy group or halogen
atom, Y represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur
atom, and Z represents an alkyl group having a carboxyl
group or an alkoxy group at terminal, comprising
catalytically reducing a compound having the general formula
(1) : 

wherein R1, R2, Y, and Z are as defined above, with hydrogen
in a solvent mixture of at least one alcohol and water
using a palladium catalyst soluble in said alcohol.Furthermore, the present invention provides a
process for producing a thiophene derivative expressed by
the general formula (2) comprising catalytically reducing a
compound having the general formula (1) with hydrogeh
using a palladium catalyst soluble in said alcohol
in a solvent mixture of at least one alcohol and water,
and then
