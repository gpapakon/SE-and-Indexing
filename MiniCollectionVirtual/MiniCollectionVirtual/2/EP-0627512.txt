<ABSTRACT>
The oscillating member formed by the heald frame (7) is associated with elastic means (15, 15') which act in an opposing manner on the said frame (7) so as to tend to return the latter into its substantially middle position.

<CLAIMS>
Mechanism for weaving machine, of the type comprising, for the
alternative control of a yarn or a group of yarns, at least one member (7) which

is positively animated by a desmodromic oscillating movement by means of a
bar (5) connecting two levers (3, 3') for manoeuvring said member,

characterized in that the oscillating member (7) is associated with elastic means
(15, 15') which act in antagonistic manner on said member (7), a connecting rod

(12) articulated about a fixed pin (13) being controlled in displacement by said
bar, while said elastic means (15, 15') exert on said connecting rod a return

force which tends to return said connecting rod and said member into a
substantially median position.
Mechanism according to Claim 1, characterized in that there are
associated with the elastic means (15, 15') adjusting means (17, 17') arranged

to allow the variation, on the one hand, of the intensity of the antagonistic
return forces and, on the other hand, of the point of static equilibrium of the

oscillating member.
Mechanism according to either one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in
that the elastic means are in the form of two elastic assemblies (15, 15')

arranged on either side of an element (12) connected thereto.
