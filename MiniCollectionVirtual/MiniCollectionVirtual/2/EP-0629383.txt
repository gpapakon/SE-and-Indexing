Dental turbine drive having a rotor (3)
mounted in a housing (2) between two ball bearings (5,

6), which rotor in known manner has means for receiving
a processing tool (9) and which, with the housing (2)

and the rotor-side front sides of the ball bearings,
forms a turbine chamber (14), which on the one hand is

connected to a supply channel (11) and on the other
hand to a return air channel (19) for a driving medium,

characterized in that the turbine chamber (14) between
the tool-side front side of the rotor (3), the housing

(2) and the rotor-side front side of the tool-side ball
bearing (6) forms an exit chamber (17) which is larger

than the gap (16) which is formed on the front side of
the rotor directed away from the tool receptacle

between the rotor, the housing (2) and the front side
of the ball bearing (5) directed away from the tool

receptacle, whereby the exit chamber (17) encloses an
exit channel (18) which extends axially close to the

tool-side rotor shaft section (4a), and in that the
return air channel (19) leads away from the exit

chamber (17) or the exit channel (18).
Turbine drive according to claim 1,
characterized in that the return air channel (19) opens

into the exit channel (18) directly adjacent to the
rotor bearing (6) near the tool and directly adjacent

to the rotor shaft section (4a).
Turbine drive according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the exit channel (18) is

constructed as an annular channel which concentrically
surrounds the tool-side rotor shaft section (4a).
Turbine drive according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that in the exit chamber closing

means (22) are present which close the opening (20) of
the return air channel (19) in the slowing-down phase

of the rotor (3) after the interruption of the supply 
of propelling air and open it again after the

interruption is stopped.
Turbine drive according to claim 1,
characterized in that the rotor shaft (4) in the region

near the tool has on the circumference control surfaces
(21) which are formed in such a way that with rotation

of the rotor (3) an outwardly directed air flow is
generated.
Turbine drive according to claim 5,
characterized in that the control surfaces (21) are

arranged on the rotor shaft (4) on both sides of the
bearing (6) near the tool.
Turbine drive according to claim 4,
characterized in that the closing and opening of the

means (22) takes place automatically in dependence upon
the supply of compressed air.
Turbine drive according to claim 7,
characterized in that elastic means (22) are provided.
Turbine drive according to claim 8,
characterized in that in the exit chamber (17) a spring

washer (22) is arranged concentrically to the turbine
shaft (4), which spring washer with its one (external

or internal) annular wall surface is fastened to the
rotor shaft (4) or to the housing (2) and with its

other annular wall surface seals or unseals the opening
(20).
Turbine drive according to claim 9,
characterized in that the spring washer (22) is

constructed and arranged in such a way that its annular
wall surface (22a) sealing or unsealing the opening

(20) comes to rest on the front surface of the rotor
(3) in the sense of a braking of the rotor when the

supply of propelling air is interrupted.
