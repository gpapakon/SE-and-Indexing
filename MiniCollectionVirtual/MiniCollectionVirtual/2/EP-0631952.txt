<ABSTRACT>
The magazine device (10) has at least two magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18). A conveyor device (26) having grippers (30) arranged in succession leads over these magazine shafts. During a specific timespan, a transport member (34) in each case extracts products (36) in succession from one of the magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18) and leads these to a respective gripper (30) running past. After a specific timespan, the products (36) are extracted from another magazine shaft (12, 14, 16, 18) by means of a transport member (34) assigned to the latter. The products (36) are cards or merchandise samples which are inserted or glued into printed matter at the further-processing station (38). Uninterrupted operation along with a high processing capacity is possible by means of this device.

A device for the feeding of products, such as cards and goods samples,
which are intended to be inserted or glued into printed products, to a further

processing site, with a magazine device (10) which has at least two magazine
shafts (12, 14, 16, 18, 90) intended to receive a stack (58) of products (36), a

conveying device (26) which leads over the magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18, 90)
arranged one behind the other, viewed in conveying direction (F) of the

conveying device (26), and to the further processing site (38) and has a plurality
of individually controllable grippers (30) arranged one behind the other on a

traction member (28) driven in a circulating manner, which grippers (30) are
intended, with the magazine device (10), to take over a product (36) and

transport it to the further processing site (38), for each magazine shaft (12, 14,
16, 18, 90) with a transport member (34) connected with a drive, which transport

member (34) is movable from a reception position (62) with a delivery site (56)
of the respective magazine shaft (12, 14, 16, 18, 90) into a transfer position (62')

with the path of motion of the grippers (30) and then back again, in order to
pick up in the reception position (62) the respectively outermost product (36) of

the stack (58), remove this from the stack (58) and introduce it into the jaw (40)
of a gripper (30), pushing means (68) associated with the magazine shafts (12,

14, 16, 18, 90), in order to push the stack (58) in the direction of the delivery
site (56), so that the outermost product (36) is situated in each case at the

delivery site (56), and with a control device (54) controlling the grippers (30)
and the transport members (34), characterised in that the control device (54)

controls the receiving of the products (36) alternately during a time span
respectively from one of the stack shafts (12, 14, 16, 18, 90).
The device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the jaws (40) of
the grippers (30) on moving past the magazine device (10) are aligned

with respect to the conveying direction F toward the rear and preferably pointed 
obliquely downward, and the transport members (34) are moved from the

reception position (62) into the transfer position (62') in a direction which has
one component in conveying direction F and one component from the magazine

device (10) towards the conveying device (26).
The device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the pushing
means (68) each have a pushing element (78) intended for engagement into the

magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18, 90) and movable along it, which pushing element
(78) is intended to engage behind th
e product (36) of the stack (58) furthest
away from the delivery position (56) and to align to the delivery position (56)

the stack (58) with the stack end facing the delivery position (56).
The device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the pushing
element (78) is connected with a running nut (76) which sits on a spindle (72)

running approximately parallel to the longitudinal direction of the magazine
shaft (12, 14, 16, 18, 90) and connected with a drive motor (74).
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18, 90), for filling with a new stack (58), are able to

be brought from an operating position (24), in which their delivery site (56) is in
the receiving position (62), into a filling position (24') in which the magazine

shalt (12, 14, 16, 18, 90) is freely accessible.
The device according to Claim 5, characterised in that the magazine
device (10) has at least two magazine units (88) with several magazine shafts

(90) rotatable about rotation axes (92), in which the magazine shafts (90) of
each magazine unit (88) are able to be brought in succession into the operating

position (24).
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
longitudinal direction of the magazine shafts (12, 14, 16, 18) runs transversely to

a horizontal plane, preferably in vertical direction or in a direction inclined
toward the rear, in which the delivery site (56) of the magazine shaft (12, 14, 16,

18) is staggered with respect to a vertical through the end of the magazine shaft
(12, 14, 16, 18) away from the delivery site (56) contrary to the conveying

direction F.
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
conveying device (26) runs in a straight line and substantially in horizontal

direction over the magazine device (10).
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
transport members (34) each have a suction head (60) temporarily connected

with a vacuum source, which suction head (60) is intended, in the receiving
position (62), to pick up the respective product (36) on the flat face facing away

from the stack (58) and securing the product (36) until in the transfer position
(62') the corresponding gripper (30) is transferred into its closed position.
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the
dimension of the products (36), measured in the direction of movement of the

transport member (34), is smaller than or equal to the centre-to-centre distance
of two successive grippers (30).
The device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised by a product
delivery unit (112) which has a box-like container (100) and a stack (58) of
