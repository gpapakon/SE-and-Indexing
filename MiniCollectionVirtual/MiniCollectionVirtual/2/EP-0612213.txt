<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNERGISTIC HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONSThis invention relates to a new herbicidal composition having synergistic activity comprising a mixture of 2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxb-4-(2-propyny1)- 2H-l,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]perhydxoimidazo[l,5-a]pyridin- 1,3-one and another selective herbicide and its use for combating weeds in crops.The herbicidal activity of 2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-(2-propγnyl)-2H-l,4-benzoxazin~6-yl]perhydro- imidazo[l,5-a]pyridin-l,3-one is already known(EP 311 135) . This compound has the following chemical structure (I)It has now been found that herbicidal compositions which comprise, as active components, a mixture of 2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-(2-propynyl)- 2H-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]perhydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridin- 1,3-one and a herbicide selected from the group consisting of glyphosate (II) , sulfometuron-methyl (III) , imazapyr (IV), 2,4-D (V), dicamba (VI), diuron (VII), oxyfluorfen (VIII) , glufosinate-ammonium (IX) , amitrole (X) and sethoxydim (XI) as well as metribuzin (XII) , linuron (XIII) , acifluorfen (XIV) , lactofen (XV) , fomesafen (XVI) , pendimethalin (XVII) , alachlor (XVIII) , metolachlor (XIX) , trifluralin (XX) , chlorimuron-ethyl (XXI) , imazaguin 

 (XXII) and imazethapyr (XXIII) , broaden the spectrum of weeds that can be controlled and show an increase in herbicidal activity in comparison with the individual components without losing the selectivity properties in agricultural crops.Glyphosate is the common name for N-(phosphonomethyl)- glycine; sulfometuron-methyl is the common name or methyl 2-(416-dimethylpyridin-2-ylcarbamoylsulfa oyl)benzoate; imazapyr is the common name for 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5- oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-nicotinic acid; 2,4-D is the common name for 2-(4-chloro-2-methyl- phenoxy)acetic acid; dicamba is the common name for 3,6 dichloro-2-methoxy- benzoic acid; diuron is the common name for 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,l- dimethylurea; oxyfluorfen is the common name for 2-chloro- α,α,o:-trifluoro-p-tolyl 3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenyl ether; glufosinate ammonium is the common name for ammonium 4-[hydroxy(methyl)phosphinoyl]-DL-homoalaninate; amitrole is the common name for lH-l,2,4-triazol-3- ylamine; sethoxydim is the common name for (±)-(EZ)-2-(l- ethoxyiminobutyl)-5-[2-(ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy- cyclohex-2-enon ; metribuzin is the common name for 4-amino-6-tert.-butyl- 4,5-dihydro-3-methylthio-l,2,4-triazin-5-one; linuron is the common name for 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)- 1-methoxy-l-methylurea; acifluorfen is the common name for 5-[2-chloro-4-
