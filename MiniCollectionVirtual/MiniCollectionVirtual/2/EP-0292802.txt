<ABSTRACT>
It is possible by synthesis of a DNA single strand with a hairpin structure at one or both ends, filling in to give the double strand and opening or elimination of the hairpin structure(s) to obtain even very long double-stranded DNA fragments or genes. It is also possible to attach mutagenic primers to the single strand and thus to carry out site-specific mutagenesis. Furthermore, the preparation of highly labelled DNA sequences is possible in the filling-in reaction.

Claims for the following Contracting States : AT, BE, CH, DE, FR, GB, GR, IT, LI, LU, NL, SE
A process for the preparation of double-stranded 
DNA, which comprises synthesis of a DNA single 

strand with a hairpin structure at one end or at 
both ends, filling-in of the complementary nucleotides, 

and opening or cleavage-off of the hairpin 
structure(s). 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein there is 
provision, adjacent to the hairpin structure, of one 

or more recognition site(s) for a restriction 
enzyme, using which it is possible to cleave off the 

hairpin structure. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
hairpin structure is opened with a nuclease specific 

for single strands. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the single-stranded DNA is 

hybridized with a mutagenic primer, and a site-specific 
mutagenesis is carried out. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein labeled nucleotides are used 

when filling in to give the double strand. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, which starts from the oligonucleotide 1  

 
(Table 1). 
Oligonucleotide 1 (Table 1). 
DNA sequence III (Table 4). 
Claims for the following Contracting State : ES
A process for the preparation of double-stranded 
DNA, which comprises synthesis of a DNA single 

strand with a hairpin structure at one end or at 
both ends, filling-in of the complementary nucleotides, 

and opening or cleavage-off of the hairpin 
structure(s). 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein there is 
provision, adjacent to the hairpin structure, of one 

or more recognition site(s) for a restriction 

enzyme, using which it is possible to cleave off the 
hairpin structure. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
hairpin structure is opened with a nuclease specific 

for single strands. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the single-stranded DNA is 

hybridised with a mutagenic primer, and a site-specific 
mutagenesis is carried out. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein labeled nucleotides are used 

when filling in to give the double strand. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, which starts from the oligonucleotide 1 

(Table 1).
