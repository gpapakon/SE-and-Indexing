<ABSTRACT>
The anti-slip chain described has a tread system made up of lengths of chain (2, 3) and chain-free zones which, when the vehicle wheel (1) fitted with the chain passes over them, produce changes in the distance between the road surface and the axis of rotation of the wheel. In order to avoid resonance effects, the tread-system sections, each comprising a length of chain (2, 3) and a chain-free zone, which follow each other round as the wheel turns, are configured differently from each other so that the time taken for the wheel to pass over a section varies.

<CLAIMS>
Antiskid chain for vehicle wheels, which has a 
tread system comprising track crosspieces, whose track 

portions oriented essentially in the circumferential 
direction of the wheel are connected outside the tread 

surface of the vehicle wheel, by connecting pieces 
oriented essentially transversely to the circumferential 

direction of the wheel, to side fastenings in such a 
manner that, as the vehicle wheel fitted with said chain 

rotates, changes occur in the distance between the 
roadway surface and the axis of rotation of the vehicle 

wheel, characterized in that the lengths of the track 
portions (5, 6) of the track crosspieces (2, 3) following 

one another in each case in the circumferential direction 
of the wheel are unequal in magnitude. 
Antiskid chain according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the track portions (5, 6) of the 

track crosspieces (2, 3) have at least three different 
lengths. 
Antiskid chain according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that track crosspieces (2, 3) having 

track portions (5, 6) of unequal lengths are distributed 
in an irregular sequence over the circumference of the 

wheel.
