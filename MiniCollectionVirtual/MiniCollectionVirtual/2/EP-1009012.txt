<ABSTRACT>
The electric lamp has a base, a transparent bulb and at least one light arrangement enclosed by the bulb. The base has a metal holder part in which the bulb is fixed and an annular metal carrier sleeve (14b) anchored in a plastic part containing the electrical connections. The base has a curved flat pressure spring (100) in contact with the sleeve's inner wall that engages an opening in the sleeve. The sleeve has two inwardly angled lugs (14d) engaged with the spring ends (104d). The spring is mounted between the lugs with a force fit.

<CLAIMS>
Electric lamp having a lamp cap, a transparent
lamp bulb (10), and having at least one luminous means

(11) surrounded by the lamp bulb (10), in which

the lamp cap has a metal holder part (14a) in
which the lamp bulb (10) is fixed,
the lamp cap has an annular metal carrier sleeve
(14b) connected to the holder part (14a), and a

plastic cap part (15) which is provided with the
electric connections (16, 17) of the lamp and in

which the carrier sleeve (14b) is anchored, and
the lamp cap has a pressing-on spring (100)
constructed as a cambered leaf spring which bears

against the inner wall of the carrier sleeve (14b)
and reaches through a cut-out in the annular

carrier sleeve (14b),

   
characterized in that
the annular carrier sleeve (14b) has two inwardly
angled lugs (14d) which are crossed in each case

with one end (104, 105) of the leaf spring (100),
and
the leaf spring (100) is arranged with a clamping
fit between the inwardly angled lugs (14d).
Electric lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 each leaf spring end (104, 105) is
equipped with at least two teeth (104a, 105a)

between which the respective, inwardly angled lug
(14d) of the carrier sleeve (14b) is arranged. 
Electric lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the angled lugs (14d) respectively form an
acute angle with the carrier sleeve (14b), each

leaf spring end (104, 105) being arranged in the
region of the acute angle between the

corresponding angled lug (14d) and the carrier
sleeve wall.
Electric lamp according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the leaf spring (100)

has a V-shaped section (101) which reaches through
the cut-out in the carrier sleeve (14b)
has two U-shaped sections (102, 103) between which
the V-shaped section (101) is arranged, the

U-shaped sections (102, 103) in each case forming
a limb of the V-shaped section (101) with one end

(104, 105) of the leaf spring (100).
Electric lamp according to Claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the leaf spring (100) bears against the
inner wall of the carrier sleeve (14b) in the

transition regions between the V-shaped section
(101) and the U-shaped sections (102, 103).
Electric lamp according to Claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the leaf spring (100) bears against the
inner wall of the carrier sleeve (14b) in the

transition regions between the U-shaped sections
(102, 103) and the respective leaf spring end

(104, 105).
Electric lamp according to Claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the connecting region (101a) between the
two V-limbs (101) is rounded off.
