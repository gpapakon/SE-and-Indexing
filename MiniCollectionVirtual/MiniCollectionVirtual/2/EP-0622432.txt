<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a novel latex saturant for porous 
backings and porous sheets, especially for paper backings used in pressure 

sensitive adhesive tapes. The saturant includes a latex an elastomer base 
compounded with both tackifying resin and filler. The elastomer base may be 

either an acrylate or a rubber, such as carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber. 
Paper incorporating the saturant of the invention provides a backing that retains 

flexibility, tensile and elongation, and gives an improved drape or hand. 
Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes which employ the compounded saturated 

backing show good adhesion with aging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel compounded latex saturant for porous 
backings, and to porous sheets, adhesive tapes and adhesive sheets which utilize 
the saturant. Paper backings are widely used in many adhesive tapes. However, 
paper may delaminate at the thicknesses most commonly used for such tapes 
(3.5 to 8 mils). Accordingly, the paper is strengthened by impregnation with a 
polymeric saturant such as styrene-butadiene or acrylic latex. In general, the 
saturant binds or welds the paper fibers together, so that the paper will not split 
or the fibers pull loose under the force exerted by the adhesive when the tape is 
unwound from a roll or removed from surfaces. Impregnants commonly used for saturating and unifying paper backings 
have traditionally been of two types as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,503,495 
(Gustafson). The first type is essentially a fluxed blend of broken down natural 
or synthetic rubber, tackifier resin, and zinc oxide. Such saturants are typically 
applied by dissolving the elastomer and other saturant components in a 
hydrocarbon solvent, immersing a porous backing in the liquid saturant, 
removing the excess liquid, and drying the backing to remove the solvent. 
Examples of solvent-based compounded saturants are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 2,410,078 (Kellgren), U.S. Patent No. 2,444,830 (Kellgren), and U.S. 
Patent No. 3,240,579 (Ahlbrecht). The second type of saturant is a synthetic rubbery polymer applied either 
as a solution in an organic solvent or as an aqueous dispersion or latex, such as 
a rubbery butadiene-acrylonitrile polymer, a rubbery acrylate polymer, rubbery 
styrene butadiene polymer or rubbery styrene butadiene-acrylonitrile polymer. 
Because of the environmental and safety considerations associated with the use 
of solvents, most commercial saturants are currently coated out of water. 
Examples of water-based latex saturants suitable for use in tape backings are  
 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,961,348 (Finnegan), U.S. Patent No. 3,256,234 
(Miller), and U.S. Patent No. 3,324,006 (Arcangeli). Several references teach the use of filler in the saturant formulation. 
For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,026,241 (Hechtman) teaches a saturated fiber 
product comprising a web of loosely bonded fibers saturated with a composition 
containing a copolymer having carboxylic acid groups or salts thereof. Several 
additives may be employed in the saturant formulation, including salts of heavy 
metals, antioxidants, sensitizing agents, and fillers such as clay,
