<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
to a cassette for heat transfer sheet. US-A-4496955 discloses a cassette in which a web of thermally
transferable material is bi-directionally movable between a supply reel and a take
up reel housed in the cassette.JP-A-59 196 283 discloses a cassette housing an ink ribbon wherein a core
body is stuck to the leading end of the ink ribbon by a single surface sticky tape.EP-A-75672 discloses a ribbon structure of a typewriter wherein the leader
and trailer are formed by adhering over the inked side of the ribbon a thin adhesive
faced tape or foil, and wherein the tape or foil is provided with a region of
adhesive engagement for attachment to supply and take-up spools. The heat transfer sheet can
be used generally in a state of its being wound around
bobbins, but it becomes important in operation to house
such heat transfer sheet so that it can be mounted on and
dismounted from a printer in a simple manner.The cassette of the present invention for
this purpose is adapted to house a delivery roll for the
heat transfer sheet and a take-up roll and is formed from
a plastic containing a lubricant. For example, by the
use of a cassette in which at least one of the cassette
body and lid which are plastic molded products and the
bobbins comprises a plastic containing a lubricant,
generation of dust can be prevented, whereby white dropout
of the printed image formed by a printer can be
prevented as much as possible to contribute to formation
of a clear image. The delivery roll and the take-up roll of the heat
transfer sheet wound on the bobbins is subjected to
moisture barrier packaging after or before assembled in a
cassette. Also, if necessary, a cushioning material may
be employed. After such moisture barrier packaging, the
package may be placed in a box by itself or together with
a packaged image-receiving sheet (moisture barrier
packaged, if necessary).The cassette used generally has a sectional shape of
spectacles or otherwise of the letter S. When a cassette
as described above is not used, the delivery roll and the
take-up roll are packaged for moistureproofness with the
use of a cushioning material and mounted on a heat-sensitive
printer.When the heat transfer sheet is wound on a delivery
roll, the terminal end is first fixed by adhesion to the
winding core of the delivery roll by a double adhesive
coated tape
as set out in the appended claim.
As the method for adhesion fixing, although
both surfaces can be caused to adhere firmly with a
strong adhesive tape so that the heat

<CLAIMS>
A cassette for heat transfer sheet comprising:

a cassette case having a display means on the outer surface
thereof;
a delivery roll and a take-up roll of a heat transfer sheet,
said delivery and take-up rolls being capable of housing in said

cassette case, said cassette being formed at least partially of
a plastic containing a lubricant;

   said delivery roll having a winding core, and the terminal
end of said heat transfer sheet being secured by adhesion to the

winding core of said delivery roll by a double-coated tacky tape
in such a manner that the adhesive force between said heat

transfer sheet and said tacky tape is greater than that between
said winding core and said tacky tape.
