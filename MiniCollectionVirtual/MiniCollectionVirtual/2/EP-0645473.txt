<ABSTRACT>
Quaternary ammonium salt having at least one alkyl 
group of 10 to 20 in carbon number is added to a chemical 

conversion solution to be at least 20 ppm in concentration, 
and a chemical conversion coating is formed on a surface of 

a metal can with this chemical conversion solution. After 
the chemical conversion coating is formed on the surface of 

the metal can with the chemical conversion solution, a 
surface treatment solution containing quaternary ammonium 

salt having at least one alkyl group of 10 to 20 in carbon 
number is applied to the surface of the metal can provided 

with the chemical conversion coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemical conversion 
method of forming a chemical conversion coating on the 
surface of a metal can with a chemical conversion solution, 
and a surface treatment method for a metal can. Metal cans include a two-piece can consisting of a bottomed 
cylindrical barrel and a top plate, and a three-piece 
can consisting of a bottomless cylindrical barrel, a base 
plate and a top plate. The barrels of such metal cans are 
generally formed by metal plates, which are successively 
treated in order of preliminary degreasing, degreasing, 
rinsing, chemical conversion, rinsing, drying and coating 
after forming. A number of can barrels are carried along a 
laterally wide line at a high speed and subjected to, treatment 
through the forming step to the drying step, while the 
width of the line is reduced between the drying step and the 
coating step so that the can barrels as gathered are carried 
one by one along the narrowed line. In the coating step, 
the can barrels which are carried one by one are successively 
subjected to printing or coating on the outer surfaces  
 
thereof. When the width of the line is reduced as described above. the can barrels as 
gathered come into contanct or collide with each other. Particularly when 
barrels of aluminum cans having high surface roughness and a high friction 
coefficent in general are carried at an extremely high speed and gathered 
together, mobility thereof is so deteriorated that the can barrels are 
collapsed or broken due to mutual contact or collision, or sprung out from 
the conveyer. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 64-85292 (1989) discloses a technique 
of employing a water-soluble material such as ethylene oxide addition alcohol 
phosphate, ethylene oxide addition alcohol or ethylene oxide addition 
fatty acid as a surface treatment agent, applying the same to the outer 
surfaces of metal cans by spraying or the like for reducing the friction coefficients 
of the outer surfaces, thereby improving mobility of the cans. On the other hand, each of Japanese Patent Laying-Open Nos. 3-207766 
(1991) and 4-66671 (1992) discloses a technique of employing a surface 
treatment solution of pH 4 to 6 consisting of polystyrene resin, orthophosphoric 
acid or condensed phosphoric acid and water and applying the same 
to the surfaces of can barrels thereby improving sliding quality of the same. 
Specifically, JP-A-4-66671 discloses an aqueous surface treating solution 
containing 1-30 g/l phosphate ions, 0.1-10 g/l condensed phosphate 
ion
