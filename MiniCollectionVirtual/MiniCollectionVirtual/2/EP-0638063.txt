<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for decolorizing 
polyalkylene polyamines. Polyalkylene polyamines are well known commercial 
compounds having a variety of uses. The end use of these 
compounds influences the amount of color which is desirable 
in the product to be sold. Methods to purify and thereby 
reduce color of polyalkylene polyamines is thus very 
important for both a producer and an end user. US-A-3,723,529 to Pitts et al., dated March 27, 1973, 
sets forth such a method. The disclosed process entails 
passing polyethylene polyamines through a carbon bed and 
then distilling the effluent. Pitts et al. explain that 
treatment with only carbon failed to decolorize the 
polyamines at temperatures of at least 190°C and, in fact, 
led to more highly colored products in some cases. Since 
distillation processes are energy intensive, however, a 
process which facilitates removal of color in polyalkylene 
polyamines without such a step is highly desirable. This invention, in one respect, is a process for 
decolorizing polyalkylene polyamines, which comprises 
contacting one or more polyalkylene polyamines having an 
average molecular weight of greater than 200 and less than 
1000 with carbon at a temperature greater than or equal to 
100°C and less than or equal to 300°C under conditions 
effective to reduce the color rating of the one or more 
polyalkylene polyamines and in the absence of a second 
decolorization step. The one or more polyalkylene polyamines that can be 
decolorized according to the process of the present 
invention are well-known compounds. It is preferred to  
 
employ a polyalkylene polyamine, or a mixture of two or 
more polyalkylene polyamines, having an average molecular 
weight of greater than 225, more preferably greater than 
250; less than 800, more preferably less than 300. 
Suitable polyalkylene polyamines can be linear, branched, 
cyclic, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable 
polyalkylene polyamines include ethylenediamine, triethylenetetramine, 
tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, 
hexaethyleneheptamine, heptaethyleneoctamine, 
piperazine, aminoethylpiperazine, propylenediamine, 
butylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 
diethylenetriamine, dipropylenetriamine, 
dibutylenetriamine, bis(pentamethylene)triamine, 
bis(hexamethylene)triamine, tripropylenetetramine, 
tris(hexamethylene)tetramine, tetrapropylenepentamine, 
tetrabutylenepentamine, tetrakis(pentamethylene)pentamine, 
tetrakis(hexamethylene)pentamine,
