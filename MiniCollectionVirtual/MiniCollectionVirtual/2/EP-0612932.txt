(12) linked by cable (13a, 13b), the carrier and carried elements 
each having at least two anchoring points for the cable disposed in 

the vicinity of the apexes of a polygon with n apexes, the cable 
being alternately anchored to a point (140a, 140b) of the carrier 

element (11) and to a point (141, 141') of the carried element (12), 
and being oriented on the anchoring points (140a) of at least a first 

(11) of the said elements in a direction transverse overall to the 
radial direction (23a, 23b), characterised in that there is used as 

the carrier or carried element a modular element (11a, 11b) 
including, on the one hand, individual anchoring modules (11a, 11b) 

and, on the other hand, assembly means (15, 17, 21) for these, and in 
that: 


in a first so-called "anchoring" phase, the cable is anchored, on 

the one hand, in each of said anchoring modules of the modular 
element and, on the other, in the other element, and 
in a second phase, the modular element is assembled. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said 
modular element (11) is chosen as the first element. 
Process according to either one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the said cable is subdivided into as many cable strands (13a, 

13b) as there are anchoring modules, each cable strand being 
associated with one anchoring module. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that, in the first phase, during a first step, the cable is first 

anchored in a plurality of pre-anchoring devices (26a, 26b, 92, 92'), 
in order to form as many cable loops as there are anchoring modules.  

 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that at least one of the said carrier and carried elements is at 

least partially manufactured by moulding, this moulding taking place 
the during the said anchoring phase. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the said carrier and carried elements are, at least partially, 

manufactured by moulding, this moulding taking place during the said 
anchoring phase. 
Process according to either one of Claim 5 or 6, taken in 
combination with Claim 4, characterised in that, in the anchoring 

phase, the loops made in the first step are positioned in the mould 
used to effect the said moulding. 
Process according to either one of Claim 5 or 6, taken in 
combination with Claim 3, characterised in that, in the anchoring 

phase, a loop is formed with each of the said cable strands, and this 
is then positioned in the mould used for the said moulding. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 8, characterised in 
that the mould used for the said moulding is provided with guiding 

means intended to hold the cable during the moulding operation. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 8, characterised in 
that, for the moulding operation, a mould is used having as many 

moulding zones as there are parts to be moulded, and a space able to 
accommodate the thickness of the cable when the mould is closed. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 10, characterised in 
that, for the said moulding, moulding means are used which permit the 

simultaneous moulding of each of the parts to be moulded. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 11, characterised in 
that each moulding zone has at least two passages adapted to receive 

the cable, when the mould is closed, each of these passages being 
associated with a sealing joint.  

 
Process according to Claim 12, characterised in that, as a 
sealing joint, an elastomer block is used which is adapted to fit, at 

least partially, around the cable. 
Process according to Claim 13, characterised in that the fitting 
of the joint around the cable results from an elastic deformation 

thereof during the closing of the mould, prior to the actual moulding 
operation. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 14, characterised in

cavities for the parts to be moulded, the mould has a sharp edge 

similar in shape to that of the directrix of the cylindrical surface 
of the said surfaces (91, 95), but with substantially smaller
