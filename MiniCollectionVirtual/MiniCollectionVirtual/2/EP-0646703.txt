<ABSTRACT>
A power train has an engine (1), such as a multi-valve, double 
overhead camshaft engine, which is equipped with a mechanical 

supercharger (20) and an intercooler (22), and a transmission (31) 
operationally 

coupled to the engine (1). The engine, which is adapted to provide 
the maximum output according to the maximum volume of supercharge 

of the mechanical supercharger (20), has an intake valve closing time 
retarded more than 65 degrees of a crank angle after bottom dead 

center on an intake stroke and a maximum speed for the maximum 
output of less than 6,000 rpm., and the transmission (31) provides in 

its highest gear the power train with a total reduction ratio in 
a relatively small range between 2.1 and 2.8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power train having a 
multi-valve double overhead camshaft (DOHC) engine equipped with 
a mechanical supercharger and a transmission. In order to increase the amount of air to be forced, under 
pressure, into an engine and thereby to increase engine output 
torque, engines are typically equipped with superchargers. In 
addition, there have been known what are called mirror cycle 
engines in which closing of intake valves is retarded greatly 
after bottom dead center so as to make effective compression 
ratio smaller than expansion ratio, thereby reducing the work of 
compression and reducing pumping loss. In recent years, the idea 
has been proposed of using this kind of method in engines 
equipped with superchargers and intercoolers with the aim of 
controlling knocking and boosting engine output torque. Such a 
Miller cycle engine is known, for instance, in Japanese 
Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 63 - 51121. In the engine described in the above-mentioned publication, 
which has double overhead camshafts and is equipped with a 
supercharger and an intercooler provided in an intake passage, 
the time at which intake valves close is retarded later than 70Â° 
after bottom dead center. With this engine, a reduction in 
effective compression ratio provides the effect of lowering the 
temperature at top dead center of compression stroke, so that  
 
knocking and temperature rise of exhaust gases are controlled and 
under these controlled conditions, the supercharging volumetric 
efficiency is increased and engine output torque is effectively 
increased. Engine output is transferred to wheels of the vehicle via a 
power transfer device, including a transmission and a reduction 
gear, which is constituent elements of a power train as well as 
an engine. Power trains installed in conventional passenger cars 
and the like, even if they includes supercharged engines, have 
overall gear ratios of about 3.15 for the highest gears i.e. at 
the smallest gear ratios, of transmissions, while having the 
maximum speed of no less than 6,500 rpm. for a maximum engine 
output. In DOHC engines, in particular, because the DOHC 
mechanisms provide improved valve lifting performance at high 
speeds, the engines have increased maximum speeds so as to attain 
horsepower. The conventional power trains of this kind achieve high 
engine output and, however, provide poor fuel economy and room 
for improvement in terms of noise, reliability and the like. It is an object of the present
