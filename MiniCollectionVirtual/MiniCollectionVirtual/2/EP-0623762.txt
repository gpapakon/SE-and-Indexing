<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a pneumatically actuated disc brake which has a brake calliper (2) which surrounds a brake disc (1) and on one side of which is arranged an application device (3) with a swivel-mounted rotary lever (4), the lever arm (4a) of which is in articulated engagement with the push rod (47,48) of a pneumatic cylinder (40) via a ball-and-socket bearing (50,51) and which acts via an eccentric (6) on a cross member (7) which is guided so as to be displaceable relative to the brake disc (1) and when the pneumatic cylinder (40) is supplied with compressed air and the rotary lever (4) is correspondingly swivelled presses a brake shoe (10) arranged at its brake-disc end against the brake disc (1). In order to obtain optimum efficiency and good service properties, the proposal is to arrange, between the ball (50) and the socket (51) of the ball-and-socket bearing (50,51), a sliding bearing (52), the pressurised sliding surface of which is composed of at least 70% by volume of polyvinylidene fluoride, at least 10% by volume of polytetrafluoroethylene and lead as the remainder.
