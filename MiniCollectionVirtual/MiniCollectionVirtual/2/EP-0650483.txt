<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed
to non-psychoactive derivatives of tetrahydrocannabinol,
which exhibit anti-inflammatory, analgesic
and leukocyte antiadhesion activities. The invention
covers novel derivatives of (3R,4R)-Δ6-tetrahydrocannabinol-7-oic
acids [hereinafter referred
to as (3R,4R)-Δ6-THC-7-oic acid], as well as
pharmaceutical compositions containing the (3R,4R)-Δ6-THC-7-oic
acid derivatives. The invention further
covers the use of the novel derivatives and
pharmaceutical compositions as therapeutic agents in
the treatment of pain and tissue inflammation.Δ1-Tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], depicted in
Formula I under alternate numbering systems, is the
major psychoactive constituent of marijuana.
 
In addition to mood-altering effects, THC has been
reported to exhibit other activities, some of which
may have therapeutic value. The potential therapeutic
value of THC has led to a search for related compounds
which, while devoid of psychoactive effects, retain
the activities of potential medicinal value.Previous work with Δ6-Tetrahydrocannabinol
[(3R,4R) 6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol,
hereinafter referred
to as Δ6-THC], depicted in Formula II, has indicated
that derivatives of this compound may prove clinically
useful. The 7-carboxy derivative of Δ6-THC [Δ6-THC-7-oic
acid] has been reported to be a non-psychoactive,
potent antagonist to endogenous platelet activating
factor and, thus, a useful treatment for PAF-induced
disorders, such as asthma, systemic anaphylaxis, and
septic shock. (U.S. Patent No. 4,973,603, issued
November 27, 1990 to Sumner Burstein). Another
derivative, (3S,4S)-7-hydroxy-Δ6-THC-1,1-dimethylheptyl,
has been reported to possess analgesic
and anti-emetic activities. (U.S. Patent No.
4,876,276).The present invention is generally directed
to non-psychoactive derivatives of Δ6-THC-7-oic acid,
which have been shown to be potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory
agents and to possess leukocyte
antiadhesion activities. The invention is further
related to the use of these derivatives as therapeutic
agents in the treatment of pain and tissue
inflammation, especially that associated with long-term
illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis.Figure 1. Synthetic scheme for Δ6-THC-7-oic
acid derivatives.Figure 2. Time course effect of
pretreatment with Compound 3a on arachidonic acid-induced
paw edema. Times shown are intervals between
the oral administration of Compound 3a (0.05 mg/kg)
and the injection of arachidonic acid (1.0 mg/paw).
