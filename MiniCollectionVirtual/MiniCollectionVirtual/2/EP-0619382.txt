<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hard sintered tools 
and manufacturing methods thereof, and more specifically, 
to highly strong and resistant to abrasion and heat, 
sintered tools and a manufacturing method thereof. Conventionally, techniques using sintered diamond as 
a tool material have been known. One example of such 
technique using sintered diamond for tool material is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 63-185859. 
Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 63-185859 discloses 
sintered diamond having its surface coated with diamond. 
Thus coating the sintered diamond with diamond prevents 
cracks from being generated and a tool material having 
high resistance to abrasion can be provided. The sintered diamond disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 63-185859 is however encountered with the 
following disadvantage. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 63-185859 uses SiC, 
metal, or the like as a binding material for the sintered 
diamond. The strength of the resultant sintered diamond 
is enhaunced by using a metal such as cobalt (Co) for the  
 
binding material rather than SiC. It would therefore be 
desirable to use a metal such as Co as a binding material 
for sintered diamond. In Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 63-185859, when a 
metal is used as a binding material for sintered diamond, 
the metal on the surface of the sintered diamond is 
removed using aqua regia. The metal of the binding 
material is therefore left inside the sintered diamond. 
Accordingly, the sintered diamond contains a relatively 
large amount of metal components of binding material 
inside thereof. Thus containing a relatively large amount of binding 
material-derived metal inside, the heat resistance of the 
sintered diamond deteriorates in heat resistance. More 
specifically, when the sintered diamond is exposed to a 
high temperature in producing vapor-synthesized diamond, 
for example, the sintered diamond is likely to 
deteriorate. In view of such issue of heat resistance, the 
inventors disclose in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 64-21076 
an application of the structure of sintered diamond 
and a diamond layer coating the diamond to a bonding tool 
which is a abrasive-resisting tool. The hard heat 
resisting sintered diamond disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 64-21076 can be used as a general cutting  
 
tool. The present invention is directed to great 
improvement of performance compared to conventional 
techniques by further optimizing the structure. It is an object of the invention to provide a
