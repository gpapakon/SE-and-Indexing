<ABSTRACT>
A document shredder has a cabinet-type base (4c, 4d) and a hood-type top (4) covering the cutting rollers (1, 2), which top has a feed channel (5) for shredded material tapering conically towards the roller nip (3), and in which top the upper limiting edge (K1) of the channel (K), viewed in vertical projection (VP), is laterally offset (a) relative to the roller nip (3). In this construction, the channel wall (6a) starting from the upper side (4a) of the top (4) and containing the front channel limiting edge (K1) is formed by a lug strip (6) constituting a separate component.

Document shredder with cabinet-like substructure (4c, 4d) and a hoodlike
attachment (4), which covers the cutting rollers (1, 2) and has a cut stock feed channel (5)

conically tapering towards the roller intake gap (3) and in which the upper boundary edge
(K
1
) of the channel (K) lies laterally offset (a) relative to the cutting roller intake gap (3) as
seen in vertical projection (VP), characterised thereby that the channel (K), which is

funnel-shaped in its cross-section, has an initially approximately horizontal course from the
cut stock feed gap (5) to its underside (K
2
) and opens curvilinearly into the largely vertically
directed roller intake gap (3), and the channel wall (6c), which goes out from the upper

side (4a) of the attachment (4) and comprises the forward channel boundary edge (K
1
), is
formed by a cap strip (6) representing a separate component.
Document shredder according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the cap strip
(6) is constructed as a removable component insertable into a corresponding recess (7) of

the housing upper part (4) and fixable therein.
Document shredder according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the cap strip
(6) comprises elements (6a and 6b) for the plugging or clipping into the hoodlike

attachment (4) and runs all round flushly relative to the upper side (4a) of the latter (4).
Document shredder according to claim 3, characterised by additional fixing screws

(8) for connection in seating-fast manner of the cap strip (6) to a corresponding flange (4b)
or the like in the interior of the attachment (4).
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised by arrangement of the photocell (11a, 11b) or of a corresponding sensor or

the like, which starts the cutting mechanism (1, 2) in the case of feed of material, in the
lower region of the feed channel (K) near the roller intake gap (3).
Document shredder according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the elements
of the photocell (11a and 11b) are inserted in sleeves (13 and 14) of feed channel (K) and

flange (4b) and the cap strip (6) is provided in the region of the photocell (11b) with a
recess (12).
