<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vibrating table (10) for vibrating a material, in particular concrete, which is to be compacted. The vibrating table has its main plane arranged essentially horizontally in operation and it furthermore bears a mould (22) containing the material to be compacted, and is mounted on the driven (exciter) shaft (40) which bears at least one unbalance (42) in order to generate an exciter force. According to the invention, provision is made for the exciter shaft (40) to be arranged perpendicularly and for the table (10) to be mounted in a manner such that in the main plane it has two degrees of freedom standing perpendicularly one above the other (X, Y direction), but in the direction of gravity is mounted essentially rigidly. Furthermore, provision is alternatively made, according to the invention, for four exciter shafts to be arranged rotationally symmetrical with respect to one another. In this arrangement, the four exciter shafts are preferably each connected to their own three-phase asynchronous motor. One of the motors operates as the control drive, the necessary phase displacement of the other three exciter shafts being realised by corresponding control of the other three motors, which are designed as follow-up motors. Provision is made, according to the invention, for the vibrating table (10) to be mounted on at least three, preferably four single-value bearings (14) which permit a vibrating motion in the main plane but suppress any perpendicular vibrations. The single-value bearings preferably comprise tension elements which can be wire cables or tension rods. It is preferred if the bearings of the vibrating table according to the invention and the exciter shafts as well as the drives necessary therefor are arranged in a pit (20) recessed into a factory floor (18) so that the vibrating table according to the invention runs essentially flush with the factory floor (18).
