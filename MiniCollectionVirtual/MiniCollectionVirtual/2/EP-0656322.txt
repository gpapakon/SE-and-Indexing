<ABSTRACT>
Purification system for eliminating impurities from fluids stored in at least one collection vessel by treatment with ozone. Downstream of the collection vessel (11, 16) is arranged a reactor (14) which can be charged with ozone (27) in which the fluids (12) to be purified (cleaned up) can be treated with ozone (27). A measurement and control instrument (37) controlling the amount of ozone necessary for the ozone treatment and a reduced-pressure feed (23) for feeding the fluids (12) are assigned to the reactor (14). The contaminated fluids (12) can be fed to a nitrifying unit (41) or to a filter system (40).

Apparatus for the common removal of impurities from both
liquid and gaseous fluids by treatment with ozone in a reactor,

containing

a suction chamber (11) for the gaseous fluid, downstream of
which is arranged a heat exchanger (13), downstream of which the

reactor (14) is arranged, the heat exchanger (13) containing a
condenser (48) for converting the gaseous fluid into various

states of aggregation and a separate feed pipe (17, 18) to the
reactor (14) for each state of aggregation,
a reservoir (16) for the liquid fluid, with which a pump (19)
in an ascending pipe (20), which is connected to a partial

vacuum supply (23) in the reservoir (16) and, via a main pipe
(21), to the lower region of the reservoir (16), is associated,

and separate suction pipes (24, 25) from the surface and the
base of the reservoir (16) which are connected to both

thereactor (14) and, via the ascending pipe (20), again to the
reservoir (16),
a partial vacuum pipe (33) connecting the gas chamber (34)
above the liquid surface in the reactor to the partial vacuum

supply (23),
an ascending pipe (31) which is arranged in the reactor and in
which a pump (32) and a partial vacuum supply (30), which is

connected via an ozone pipe (29) to the ozoniser (28), are
installed,
and a measuring and regulating device (37) controlling the
amount of ozone.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the
partial vacuum supplies (23, 30) are venturi nozzles.
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that an irrigation installation (57) increasing the air humidity

and the oxygen content of the purified fluid is arranged
downstream of the reactor (14a).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the
irrigation installation (57) is connected via a feed pipe (56)

to at least one container (42a, 42b).
Apparatus according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in
that the irrigation installation (57) comprises several series-arranged

interconnected containers (42a, 42b), the containers
(42a, 42b) are arranged in the form of a cascade, the fluid is

conveyed from a reservoir (16) to the first container (42a) and,
after passing through the container cascade (42a, 42b), is

returned to the reservoir (16).
Apparatus according to claims 3 to 5, characterised in that
the containers (42a, 42b) are planted with green plants.
Process for the common removal of impurities from both
liquid and gaseous fluids by treatment with ozone by means of an

apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the gas to be purified,
from the suction chamber, is first condensed in the heat

exchanger and the liquid phase (condensate) and gaseous phase
(residual gas) so obtained are transferred separately into

the reactor, and the liquid to be purified is conveyed from the
reservoir into the reactor, the partial vacuum required for

transporting the fluids being generated by means of the partial
vacuum supply arranged in the reservoir, and wherein ozone is

sucked from the ozoniser and into the reactor by means of a
partial vacuum generated at the partial vacuum supply in the

reactor, the amount of ozone required for the ozone treatment
being controlled by means of a measuring and regulating device 

in accordance with a nominal value that is to be fixed
beforehand and that results from reaction-specific parameters.
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that the
purified fluid runs through a downstream, cascade-form series of

containers.
