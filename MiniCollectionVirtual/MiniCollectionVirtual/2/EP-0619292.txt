<ABSTRACT>
Highly esterified alkoxylated polyol fat substitutes are obtained by a two-step 
process in which a partially esterified product is obtained by reacting epoxide, aliphatic 

polyol and triglyceride in the presence of an alkali metal or alkaline earth and then the 
product is contacted with a fatty acid to form the highly esterified material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for obtaining highly
esterified alkoxylated polyol compositions useful as reduced
calorie fat substitutes from naturally occurring triglycerides
such as fats and oils.A wide variety of substances have been proposed for use as
fat substitutes in food compositions. The chemical structures of
such substances are selected such that they are more resistant to
breakdown by the metabolic processes of the human digestive
system which normally occur upon ingestion of conventional
triglyceride lipids. Because of their increased resistance to
digestion and absorption, the number of calories per gram
available from the fat substitutes is considerably reduced as
compared to common vegetable oils, animal fats, and other lipids.
The use of such substances thus enables the preparation of
reduced calorie food compositions useful in the control of body
weight.U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,613 describes one class of particularly
useful fat substitutes wherein a polyol such as glycerin is
alkoxylated with an epoxide such as propylene oxide and then
esterified with any of a number of fatty acids or fatty acid
equivalents to form an esterified alkoxylated polyol. Generally 
speaking, it is desirable to accomplish nearly complete
esterification (i.e., to react at least 90% of the hydroxyl
groups of the alkoxylated polyol intermediate with fatty acid).
These substances have the physical and organoleptic properties of
conventional triglyceride lipids, yet are significantly lower in
available (absorbed) calories than edible oils owing to their
pronounced resistance towards pancreatic lipase enzymatic
hydrolysis. The thermal and oxidative stability of the
esterified alkoxylated polyols renders them especially suitable
for use in the preparation of reduced calorie food compositions
requiring exposure to high temperatures.The methods developed to date for the preparation of
esterified alkoxylated polyol fat substitutes of this type have
largely required multi-step procedures when a naturally occurring
triglyceride is to be utilized as the source of the long chain
acyl groups incorporated into the esterified alkoxylated polyol.
The triglyceride is first hydrolytically split into glycerin
(which may be employed as the polyol component) and a mixture of
fatty acids. The fatty acids (after separation from the
glycerin) may be used directly without further modification as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,329. Alternatively, the fatty
acids prior to use in an esterification reaction with an
alkoxylated polyol may
