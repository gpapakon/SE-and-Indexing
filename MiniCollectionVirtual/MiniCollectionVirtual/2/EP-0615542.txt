<ABSTRACT>
Liquid laundry detergent compositions containing anionic or nonionic surfactant, citric acid or a water-soluble salt thereof, proteolytic enzyme, cellulase, and a mixture of 1,2 propane diol and boric acid or its derivative. The compositions are prepared by adding the diol and boric acid before adding the citric acid/salt to the composition. This order of addition improves the stability of the cellulase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid laundry detergent 
compositions containing anionic or nonionic surfactant, citric 
acid or a water-soluble salt thereof, proteolytic enzyme, 
cellulase, 1,2 propane diol (hereinafter also referred to as diol) 
and boric acid or its derivative (hereinafter also referred to as 
boric acid). The compositions are prepared by adding the diol and 
boric acid to the composition before adding the citric acid/salt 
to the composition. This order of addition improves the stability 
of the cellulase in the presence of the proteolytic enzyme. A commonly encountered problem with protease-containing 
liquid detergents is the degradation of other enzymes in the 
composition by the proteolytic enzyme. The stability of the other 
enzyme upon storage and its performance can be impaired by the 
proteolytic enzyme. Boric acid and boronic acids are known to reversibly inhibit 
proteolytic enzymes. A discussion of the inhibition of one serine 
protease, subtilisin, by boronic acid is provided in Philipp, M. 
and Bender, M.L., "Kinetics of Subtilisin and Thiolsubtilisin", 
Molecular & Cellular Biochemistry, vol. 51, pp. 5-32 (1983). One class of boronic acid, peptide boronic acid, is discussed 
as an inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, especially in 
pharmaceuticals, in European Patent Application 0 293 881, Kettner 
et al., published December 7, 1988. In liquid detergents built with citric acid or a 
water-soluble salt thereof, boric acid appears to complex with the 
citric acid/salt. It is believed that this adversely affects 
boric acid's function as a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor. The 
proteolytic enzyme then is free to degrade cellulase in the 
composition, rendering it less effective. The extent to which the 
citric acid/salt complexes with a boric acid derivative is  
 
believed to be a function of the type of derivative employed in 
the composition. The effectiveness of boric acid as a proteolytic enzyme 
inhibitor can be increased by the addition of 1,2 propane diol. 
Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that a 
predominantly 1:1 molar boric/diol complex is formed which is 
capable of binding with the active site (serine) on the 
proteolytic enzyme and inhibiting it. However, it has been found that the addition of boric acid to 
liquid detergents containing citric acid/salt and 1,2 propane diol 
does not significantly improve cellulase stability in the presence 
of protease unless the boric acid and diol are added to the 
composition prior to the citric
