<ABSTRACT>
A carry indicating circuit selectively generates a carry-in 
signal indicating whether the addition of a first plurality 

of bits results in a carry. A first carry chain circuit 
selectively generates a first carry-out signal indicating 

whether the addition of a second plurality of bits together 
with a carry from the addition of the first plurality of bits 

results in a carry, and a second carry chain circuit 
selectively generates a second carry-out signal indicating 

whether the addition of the second plurality of bits without a 
carry from the addition of the first plurality of bits results 

in a carry. Selection circuitry, coupled to the carry 
indicating circuit and to the first and second carry chain 

circuits, selects either the first carry-out signal or the 
second carry-out signal in response to the carry-in signal. 

The first and second carry chain circuits and/or the selection 
circuitry each includes a first transistor connected to a 

second transistor so that the first and second transistors may 
be initially biased in a nonconducting state when a first node 

is at a first voltage potential and a second node is at a 
second voltage potential, the first voltage potential being 

different from the second voltage potential. Altering 
circuitry is provided for altering the voltage potential at 

the first and second nodes for causing the first and second 
transistors to be in a conducting state and for accelerating 

the voltage at the first and second nodes to final voltage 
potentials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adders for binary numbers and, 
more particularly, to a carry chain adder using regenerative 
push-pull differential logic. Traditional adders for binary numbers typically add bit 
pairs sequentially from the least significant bit position to 
the most significant bit position. Sequential operation is 
usually necessary because each addition must take into account 
the possibility of a carry from the previous addition. 
Consequently, addition of large numbers often takes an 
excessively log time. Carry chain adders are frequently used to quickly add two 
binary numbers without the performance penalty inherent with 
traditional serial adders. Carry chain adders add subsets of 
bits at a time, typically one byte of each input number, and 
each byte addition is performed in parallel with the other 
byte additions. Of course, each byte addition, in order to be 
correct, must take into account the possibility of a carry 
from the previous byte addition in the series. To accommodate 
the possibility of a carry from the previous byte addition in 
the series, two parallel additions are performed for each byte 
of the input numbers. One addition assumes that a carry will 
be generated from the previous byte addition in the series, 
and the other addition assumes no carry will be generated from 
the previous byte addition in the series. By the time the two 
additions are complete, the existence or nonexistence of a 
carry from the previous set of additions will be known, and 
that information may be used by byte carry select circuitry to 
select the correct result from among the two parallel 
additions.  Some carry chain adders employ static logic elements 
which require switching serially connected transistors in 
order to bring about the desired logic state. This limits the 
speed at which the circuit may operate and consumes excessive 
power as some transistors attempt to counteract current flow 
through other transistors in a crowbar configuration. Other 
carry chain adders use dynamic logic connected in series, but 
self-loading of the serially connected logic elements limits 
the number of dynamic logic elements which may be connected 
together. For a more detailed discussion of the problems 
encountered when using known static and dynamic logic 
elements, refer to copending U.S. patent application serial 
no. 08/121,136 filed September 14, 1993 entitled "CMOS Circuit
