<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport unit of a ground-level transport system with rails and current conductors let into depressions in the ground or floor in order to supply the drive power and with at least two drive wheels and at least two current collector slider arms which interact with the current conductors, and at least two guide elements which slide in a recessed channel which describes the travel path and are connected to the chassis of the said transport unit, provided with at least one centrally arranged drive wheel (36) which is mounted in a bearing assembly (53) which can be rotated about a vertical swivel axis (x) and with a horizontal shaft unit (D) which extends in the direction of travel, can be disconnected from the chassis (40) of the transport unit (30), can be pivoted about the swivel axis (x) and on which the bearing assembly (53) with the drive motor (38) and a transmission unit (39) which is connected between the said drive motor (38) and the drive wheel (36) is mounted, and also with a slide frame (44) to which the shaft unit (D) is connected and which is held by means of guide flanges on each side in slide guides (54) which are mounted on the chassis (40), and can be released from the said chassis (40) and moved forward out of the chassis.

travel way and with 
c. at least one driving wheel (36), centrally arranged and 
lodged in a bearing unit (53) slewable around a vertical 

guiding axis (x), 
 
   characterized 


d. by a horizontal pole assembly (D) extending into the direction 
of motion, separable from the chassis (40) of the  

 
transport unit (30) and slewable around the guiding axis 

(x), to which have been secured the bearing unit (53) with 
the driving motor (38) and a gearbox (39) to be found between 

this motor and the driving wheel (36), and further 
e. by a slide frame (44) to which the pole assembly (D) has 
been linked, and this frame is held in slide guides (54),

the guiding flanges arranged at both sides, is detachable 

from this chassis (40) and movable ahead from the latter. 
Transport unit according to claim 1, characterized in
 
   that the pole assembly (D) extends ahead in the direction 

of motion, and is held by a strap (48). 
Transport unit according to claim 1, characterized in
 
   that a part of the pole assembly (D) extends to the rear, 

contrary to the direction of motion. 
Transport unit according to claim 3, characterized in
 
   that the pole assembly (D) has been linked to the slide 

frame (44) by means of a live ring or a ball bearing slowing 
rim (45). 
Transport unit according to claim 1, characterized in
 
   that in the sphere of the end of one or both poles (37) at 

least one slewable guiding element (31), engaging the travel 
way channel (15) and designed as an oblong slider, has been 

arranged at a pole head (46).  
 
Transport unit according to claim 5, characterized in
 
   that the guiding element (31) can be slewed and/or 

laterally adjusted by means of a remote-controllable drive (47). 
Transport unit according to claim 5, characterized in
 
   that the pole head (46) can be shifted on a strap (48) in a 

sliding manner opposite to the action of a spring, out of its 
home position. 
Transport unit according to claim 7, characterized in
 
   that the strap (48) shows a circular tube profile and that 

the spring action is due to a coil spring (49). 
Transport unit according to claim 5, characterized in
 
   that the pole head (46) has been equipped with a proximity 

sensor (50) releasing a control signal prior to colliding with 
an obstacle. 
Transport unit according to claim 1, characterized in
 
   that at least two non-driven support wheels have been 

provided, arranged at a certain lateral distance from the driving 
wheel (36) and lodged at both sides within the sphere of the 

lateral limit (41) of the chassis (40) pertaining to the transport 
unit (30). 
Transport unit according to claim 1, characterized in
 
   that within the sphere of the lateral limit (41) of the
