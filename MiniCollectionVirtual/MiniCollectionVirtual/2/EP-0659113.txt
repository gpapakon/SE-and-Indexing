<ABSTRACT>
A novel method of molding an article includes providing a mould with a vent of a pre-determined size such that, due to the difference in viscosities, gases to be vented from the mold may easily pass through the vent while the material to be molded cannot quickly pass through the vent. In fact, the vent is designed such that the material to be molded which enters the vent; does not exit the end of the vent. In the most preferred embodiment, the vent is in the form of a thin ribbon-like groove so that the material to be molded which does enter the vent forms a thin ribbon of extruded material which need not be removed prior to a finish cover being applied to the molded article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel mold for producing 
foamed articles. Specifically, an aspect of the present invention relates 
to an improved mold including a vent capable of providing necessary 
venting of the mold while minimizing extrusion of raw material into the 
vent, thus reducing wastage. In its most preferred embodiment, the 
present invention also eliminates the requirement to remove the extruded 
raw material from the molded article prior to application of a finish (e.g. 
trim) cover. The present invention also relates to a novel method of 
molding articles which reduces wastage resulting from raw material 
being extruded into the vent during venting of the mold. In its most 
preferred embodiment, the method reduces or eliminates the requirement 
to remove the extruded material prior to application of a finish cover. Many articles are manufactured by placing a raw material 
into a cavity in a mold wherein the raw material undergoes a physical 
change (e.g. it expands or foams) and the article produced thus acquires 
the shape of the cavity. In particular, this technique is commonly 
employed for producing foamed articles made from polymeric foams 
such as polyurethane foam, latex (e.g. natural and styrene-butadiene 
rubber) foam and the like. For example, automotive seats are commonly manufactured 
from polyurethane cushions which are molded to shape and then covered 
with a vinyl, cloth or leather finish cover. Polyurethane foams are 
somewhat unique in that foaming and at least a portion of the 
polymerization process occur simultaneously. Thus, in the production  
 
of polyurethane foam using, for example, a conventional cold foam 
technique, a typical formulation comprises: 
1. Polyol 2. Water 3. Tetramethyl ethane diamine 4. Dimethyl ethanol amine 5. Polyisocyanate  
The mixture is dispensed into a mold using a suitable mixing head, after 
which the mold is then closed to permit the expanding mass within it to 
be molded. Accordingly, it is convenient generally to refer to the 
mixture initially dispensed into the mold as "a liquid foamable polymeric 
composition" or, in this case, "a liquid foamable polyurethane 
composition". As the composition expands in the mold, polymerization 
occurs and the polymer so formed becomes solidified. When molding a liquid foamable polymeric composition to 
form articles such as polyurethane foam articles, it is conventional to use 
a clam-shell mold comprising a bottom mold and a top mold which, 
when closed, define a mold cavity. The mold is

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing an article (420) in a mold (400) comprising an upper mold (408) 
and a lower mold (404) defining a mold cavity (412) the process comprising the steps of: 


dispensing a liquid foamable polymeric composition into the mold cavity (412); 
allowing the liquid foamable polymeric composition to expand to 
substantially fill the mold cavity (412); and 
venting gases in the mold cavity (412) through at least one vent (416) in the mold (400) to 
allow the gases to exit from the mold (400), the size of each vent (416) being selected such that 

movement of the liquid foamable polymeric composition into the vent (416) is restricted to 
substantially prevent exit thereof from the vent (416). 
The method of claim 1, wherein said at least one vent (416) is located at the 
part-line between said upper mold (408) and said lower mold (404). 
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the size of each 
vent (416) comprises a thickness of from about 0.050 mm (0.002 inches) to about 0.765 mm (0.030 inches). 
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein each vent (416) is 
substantially rectangular in cross-section and said liquid foamable polymeric material 

entering said vent (416) results in a ribbon (424) of polymeric material attached to said article.
