<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fluorinated polymers or copolymers 
in the form of moulded articles having improved mechanical 
and surface properties. The polymers according to the 
invention contain a reinforcing filler based on glass, 
asbestos, silicates in general, carbon, aromatic polyamides, 
in the form of powders or fibres. Said reinforcing fillers 
are pretreated with fluoropolyethers having functional end 
groups, which impart improved mechanical properties and 
improved surface characteristics compared with the 
reinforcing fillers known in the art. The fillers treated 
according to the present invention remain perfectly dispersed 
in the polymer and, thus, during mechanical treatment, 
prevent the separation thereof in heterogeneous areas, which 
would impair the mechanical and surface properties.  
 US-A-4,036,807 relates to silanes and siloxanes having one or 
more unsaturated fluorocarbon substituents therein. Said compounds 
may be used, among others, for the treatment of glass 
fillers in the manufacture of filled granular grades of fluorocarbon 
polymers. Particularly, according to said document 
correspondingly treated fillers can be employed in a certain 
aqueous agglomeration method to produce free flowing filled 
particles from poorly flowing polymer. US-A-3,950,588 describes substrates or articles having surfaces 
with silanol-reactive groups, e.g. glassware, which are 
coated with hydrolyzable di-silyl poly(perfluorooxyalkylene) 
compounds to provide said substrates or articles with a durable, 
oil and water repellent, abrasion resistant polysiloxane 
coating or film.  
 It is well-known that, in order to improve the mechanical 
and surface characteristics of fluorinated polymers, these 
are reinforced with fillers, in particular, glass fibres 
treated with organic compounds, so as to increase the 
compatibility of such fibres with polymers such as, for 
example, polytetrafluoroethylene. According to US-A- 3 787 281, the glass fibre treatment is 
carried out by means of a hydrolizable non-fluorinated 
siloxane compound containing an amine end group. According to GB-A-1 250 798, both siloxane compounds and 
alkoxy-titanium compounds are utilized for the surface 
treatment of reinforcing materials such as glass fibres or 
metal powders. The compounds utilized for said treatment 
do not contain fluorine. Examples thereof are, in particular, 
Ti-tetrabutylate, 3-aminopropyl-triethoxy-silane and  
 
phenylmethyl-polysiloxane. The articles obtained from the polymers which have been
