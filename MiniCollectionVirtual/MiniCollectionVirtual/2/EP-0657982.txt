<ABSTRACT>
A battery use system for a battery-driven portable 
electronic equipment includes a first battery (1) chargeable and 

serving as a direct power supply source, a second battery (2) 
parallelly connected to the first battery through a switch (3), 

a voltage detection circuit (4) for detecting an output voltage 
from the first battery, a consumption current detection 

circuit (5) for detecting the state of the consumption current 
of the portable electronic equipment, and a switch control 

circuit (6) for controlling open and close of the switch in 
accordance with an output from the voltage detection circuit 

and an output from the consumption current detection 
circuit. The switch is closed to charge the first battery 

by the second battery when the output voltage from the first 
battery becomes smaller than a predetermined value, and at 

the same time, the consumption current is sufficiently 
small.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery
system for a portable electronic equipment and, more
particularly, to a battery system capable of prolonging
a use time of a battery-driven portable electronic equipment.Conventionally, as a power supply battery used in a
portable electronic equipment, a nickel-cadmium battery
having high safety and a low internal resistance, a
nickel-hydrogen battery having a larger capacity, or the
like is often used. However, to use the electronic equipment
for a longer time, the capacity of the power supply
needs to be increased. For this purpose, a battery back-up
system by a primary battery as in the first prior art (to be
described later), multi-stage series connection as in the
second prior art, or a lithium-ion battery having a larger
capacity as in the third prior art is used.More specifically, in the first prior art, as shown
in Fig. 1, a secondary battery 100 is parallel connected
between a power supply input terminal 7 and a ground
terminal 8 of an electronic equipment 110 through a diode
28. A primary battery 31 is also parallel connected 
between the terminals 7 and 8 through a charge preventing
diode 29 and a resistor 30. Normally, the secondary battery
100 applies a power supply voltage to the electronic
equipment 110 while no power is supplied from the primary
battery 31 because of the function of the resistor 30.
Additionally, because of the function of the charge preventing
diode 29, the primary battery 31 is not charged by the
secondary battery 100. When the power supply from the
secondary battery 100 is stopped, the power supply for the
electronic equipment 110 is backed up by the primary battery
31.In the second prior art, as shown in Fig. 2, a
number of power supply batteries are connected in series
with each other to constitute a secondary battery 32. This
secondary battery 32 is set to a desired voltage through a
regulator 33 and parallel connected to an electronic
equipment 110, thereby increasing the capacity of the power
supply.In the third prior art, as shown in Fig. 3, a
lithium-ion battery 13 whose large capacity is receiving a
great deal of attention today is parallel connected to an
electronic equipment 110.Note that, in the present invention, an unchargeable
battery which is discarded after consumption is defined as
a primary battery, and a chargeable battery is defined as a 
secondary battery.The above prior arts have the following problems.That is, in the first prior art, since the primary
battery 31 is used, this battery is wastefully
