<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disinfectant
compositions, particularly disinfectant compositions for
fabric.The invention has been developed primarily for use
as a disinfectant composition for heavily soiled and wet
household fabrics and will be described hereinafter with
reference to this application. However, it will be
appreciated that the invention is not limited to this
particular field of use.The disinfection and deodorizing of heavily soiled
and wet household fabrics is difficult for many reasons
and is exacerbated by prolonged periods of wetness.
Prolonged periods of wetness regularly occur due to such
events as water leakage, broken water mains, storm
damage and natural flooding disasters. Flooding due to 
natural disasters can represent a worst case scenario
because carpets and fabrics are also soiled by mud and
other debris which require extensive cleaning and
disinfection to achieve restoration of fabric.In the past, biocides have been employed to
disinfect and deodorize wet household fabrics but most
fibres employed in household fabric adsorb biocides.
Accordingly, the fabric itself can inactivate many
common biocidal molecules and render disinfection and
deodorization ineffective over a large area of fabric.
In an attempt to overcome this problem the concentration
of active biocide has, in the past, been increased to
overcome the loss of biocide by adsorption or a biocide,
minimally reactive to fibres, is utilized to minimize
the loss of biocide by adsorption.However, many such fibres are also known to adsorb
significant quantities of water, when wet, and the water
adsorbed is known to alter the concentration of active
biocides whether applied in high or low concentrations.
The resultant dilution of biocide concentration levels
significantly reduces biocide activity and the dilution
effect can be even more significant when the biocides
form part of a cleaning agent with surfactants,
disinfectants and deodorants.Ideally, an effective fabric disinfectant and
deodorant should be capable of removing spots and stains
encountered on most household fabrics and the effect of 
wet fabric can therefore reduce the efficiency of a
cleaning agent formulated from the said disinfectants,
deodorants and surfactants.Another factor affecting the efficiency of biocides
and cleaning agents incorporating biocides is that
wetness of fabric, particularly in soft floor coverings,
is often accompanied by the growth of microbes, mould
and bacterial spores often already resident in the
fabric before the fabric is
