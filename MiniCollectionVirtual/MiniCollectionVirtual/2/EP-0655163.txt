<ABSTRACT>
In a hinged case for disk-shaped objects, in particular compact disks, with a base (14) and a cover (1) which is connected with the base (14) through a hinged connnection created using a pin (8) protruding through a recess (20), with overlapping walls (3, 5; 17, 19), and with a plate support (24) that is inserted between base (14) and cover (1), has an extension piece (24) over the hinged connection and is secured against getting lifted off the base, the invention prevents an improper separation of base (14) and cover (1) in that the recess (20) is made open to the edge (22) of the wall (17) in which it is situated, that the pin (8) protrudes through the recess (20) and has a flange (9) at its free end, the diameter of which is greater than that of the recess (20), and that the plate support (24) fits against the flange (9) on the open side of the recess (20) and thus blocks the pin (8) from coming out of the recess (20).

A hinged case for disk-shaped objects, in particular 
compact disks, with a base (14) and a lid (1), which is 

hingedly connected to the base (14) via a hinge connection 
in overlapping walls (3, 5; 17, 19) formed by means of a 

bolt (8) projecting into a recess (20), and with a support 
plate (24), which is inserted between the base (14) and lid 

(1), projects with a shoulder (29) over the hinge connection 
and is secured against lifting from the base, characterised 

in that the recess (20) is open towards the edge (22) of the 
wall (17) comprising said recess, the bolt (8) projects 

through the recess (20) and at its free end comprises a 
flange (9), whose diameter is greater than that of the 

recess (20) and the support plate (24) rests against the 
flange (9) on the open side of the recess (20), and thus 

blocks the exit of the bolt (8) from the recess (20). 
A hinged case according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the opening of the recess (20) is directed towards the 

nearby edge (16) of the base (14) and lid (1). 
A hinged case according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the recess (20) is somewhat larger than a semi-circle 

with an internal diameter corresponding to the 
external diameter of the bolt (8), so that the bolt Can be 

snapped into the recess (20). 
A hinged case according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the opening is formed by edges (23) 

arranged in the shape of a funnel. 
A hinged case according to claim 4, characterised in 
that a line of symmetry of the edges (23) of the opening is 

inclined towards the nearby edge (16) of the base (14) and 
lid (1).  

 
A hinged case according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the hinge connection is identically 

constructed on opposing sides of the case. 
A hinged case according to one of claims 1 to 6; 
characterised in that the support plat
e (24) rests against 
the flange (9) of at least one bolt (8) with at least one 

wall part (30) lying parallel to the walls (3, 5; 17, 19) 
provided with bolt (8) and recess (20). 
A hinged case according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the wall part (30) of the support plate (24) comprises 

a rounded recess (32). 
A hinged case according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the rounded recess (32) has a curvature corresponding 

to the diameter of the flange (9).
