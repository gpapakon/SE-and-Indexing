<ABSTRACT>
An antiplaque oral composition such as a gel, paste or mouthrinse which is 

comprised of a vehicle having incorporated therein as the antiplaque agent an 
effective amount of an antibacterial salicylanilide compound and a surfactant 

mixture of an anionic surfactant, a polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block 
copolymer and a taurate salt, the pH of the composition being adjusted to a pH 

of at least 8.0. An antibacterial-enhancing agent such as an anionic polymeric 
polycarboxylate which enhances the delivery of the salicylanilide compound to 

and retention on oral tissue surfaces is optionally incorporated in the 
composition to improve the efficacy of the salicylanilide compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antibacterial, antiplaque oral composition. 
More particularly, it relates to an oral composition containing a substantially 
water insoluble salicylanilide antibacterial agent effective to inhibit plaque and 
more particularly to an oral composition containing a halogenated 
salicylanilide antibacterial agent wherein the oral composition exhibits a 
reduced tendency to undergo phase separation and exhibits improved 
antiplaque efficacy. Dental plaque is a soft deposit which forms on teeth as opposed to 
calculus which is a hard calcified deposit on teeth. Unlike calculus, plaque 
may form on any part of the tooth surface, particularly including at the gingival 
margin. Besides being unsightly, it is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis. Salicylanilide compounds have been identified by the art to be effective 
antiseptics against microorganisms prevalent in dental plaque. For example 
U.S. Patents 4,287,191, 4,358,443 and U.S. 4,939,132 disclose that certain 
salicylanilide compounds such as 5-acylsalicylanilides, 5-alkyl salicylanilides 
and 5-alkylsulfonyl salicylanilides are highly effective against bacteria 
prevalent in plaque, including S. mutans. U.S. 5,154,917, 5,145,667, and  
 
4,749,562 disclose that halogenated salicylanilide compounds are effective 
antiplaque agents. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to include salicylanilide compounds in 
oral compositions such as toothpastes, gels and mouthrinses. However the 
salicylanilide compounds are water insoluble and extremely hydrophobic and 
are incompatible with most conventional oral compositions which are aqueous 
based formulations containing anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl 
sulfate. It has therefore been observed that when aqueous based oral 
compositions are prepared using a salicylanilide antibacterial agent such as a 
5-acylsalicylanilide, there is a tendency for the oral composition to be unstable 
and separate into two distinct phases either liquid/solid portions or liquid/liquid 
portions, rendering the oral composition undesirable for use by consumers. 
When attempts are made to formulate stable oral care products with the 
salicylanilide compound using a variety of nonionic surfactants it has been 
determined that the antibacterial efficacy of the compound is compromised. There is therefore a need in the art to provide oral compositions 
containing salicylanilide compounds effective for antiplaque activity wherein 
phase separation of the dentifrice is substantially avoided without
