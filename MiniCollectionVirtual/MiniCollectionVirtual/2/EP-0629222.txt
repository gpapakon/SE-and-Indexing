<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing carbon blacks comprised of mixing an oxidant, primary fuel, and carbon black feedstock to form carbon black particles and aggregates, passing the mixture through a reactor, cooling, separating, and recovering the carbon black product. The improvement comprises the addition of a secondary oxidant-containing stream to the reactor such that the secondary oxidant stream does not interfere with the formation of the carbon black particles and aggregates in the reactor. Also disclosed are new carbon black products defined by the following parameters: 35 m

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new process for
producing furnace carbon blacks and a class of new and novel
furnace carbon blacks which are suitable for various
applications and particularly well suited for use in rubber or
plastic compositions.Carbon blacks are generally produced in a furnace-type
reactor by pyrolyzing a hydrocarbon feedstock with hot
combustion gases to produce combustion products containing
particulate carbon black. A variety of methods for producing
carbon blacks are generally known.In one type of a furnace carbon black reactor, such as
shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,401,020 to Kester et al., or U.S.
Patent No. 2,785,964 to Pollock, hereinafter "Kester" and
"Pollock" respectively, a fuel, preferably hydrocarbonaceous,
and an oxidant, preferably air, are injected into a first zone
and react to form hot combustion gases. A hydrocarbon feedstock
in either gaseous, vapor or liquid form is also injected into
the first zone whereupon pyrolysis of the hydrocarbon feedstock
commences. In this instance, pyrolysis refers to the thermal
decomposition of a hydrocarbon. The resulting combustion gas
mixture, in which pyrolysis is occurring, then passes into a
reaction zone where completion of the carbon black forming 
reactions occurs.In another type of furnace black reactor, a liquid or
gaseous fuel is reacted with an oxidant, preferably air, in the
first zone to form hot combustion gases. These hot combustion
gases pass from the first zone, downstream though the reactor,
into a reaction zone and beyond. To produce carbon black, a
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock is injected at one or more points
into the path of the hot combustion gas stream. The
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock may be liquid, gas or vapor, and may
be the same or different from the fuel utilized to form the
combustion gas stream. Generally the hydrocarbonaceous
feedstock is a hydrocarbon oil or natural gas. However, other
hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks such as acetylene are known in the
art. The first (or combustion) zone and the reaction zone may
be divided by a choke, or zone of restricted diameter, which is
smaller in cross section than the combustion zone or the
reaction zone. The feedstock may be injected into the path of
the hot combustion gases upstream of, downstream of, and/or in
the restricted diameter zone. Furnace carbon black reactors of
this type are generally described in U.S. Patent Reissue No.
28,974 and U.S. Patent No. 3,922,355.In both types of processes and reactors described above,
and in other generally known reactors

A process for producing carbon blacks comprising:

a) reacting an oxidant, primary fuel, and carbon black feedstock in a
reactor to form an effluent composed of carbon black and

combustion gases;
b) injecting a stream containing additional oxidant into the reactor at a
location after which the carbon black particles and aggregates ave

been formed;
c) passing the effluent through the reactor;
d) cooling, separating, and recovering the carbon black product.

into the reactor at a location where the temperature of the effluent in the

reactor is between 982°C (1800°F) and 1482°C (2700°F), and in an
amount sufficient to raise the effluent temperature by a minimum amount

depending on residence time of the carbon black in the reactor after
oxidant-containing stream addition as defined by:


ΔT
