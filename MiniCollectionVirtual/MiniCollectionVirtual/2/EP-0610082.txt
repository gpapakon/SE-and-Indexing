<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-terminal
nonlinear device. Such a device may be used, for
instance, in a liquid crystal display apparatus, as a
switching element.In recent years, liquid crystal display
apparatuses have been widely used in various fields,
such as an audio visual (AV) field and an office automation
(OA) field. In particular, products of the low
end are equipped with twisted nematic (TN), or super
twisted nematic (STN) passive type liquid crystal
display apparatuses, and products of high quality are
equipped with active matrix type liquid crystal display
apparatuses using thin film transistors (TFTs) which
are three-terminal nonlinear devices.The active matrix liquid crystal display
apparatus is superior to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for
its characteristics of color reproducibility, saving
space, light weight, and low power. Due to such characteristics,
applications thereof have been rapidly
developed. However, in the case of using the TFTs as
switching elements, from 6 to 8 times or more fabrication
processes of a thin film and a photolithography
process are required for forming the TFTs, so increasing
the manufacturing costs. On the other hand, the
liquid crystal display apparatus using two-terminal
nonlinear devices as the switching elements is superior
to the liquid crystal display apparatus using the TFTs 
for its savings in cost, and superior to a liquid
crystal display apparatus of a passive type for its
display quality. Thus, the liquid crystal display
apparatus using the two-terminal nonlinear devices has
been rapidly developed.As the above-mentioned two-terminal nonlinear
device, two-terminal nonlinear devices of a Schottky
diode type, a varistor type, and an MIM (metal-insulator-metal)
type have conventionally been known. In
recent years, two-terminal nonlinear devices of a D2R
(double diode plus reset) type and an organic ferroelectric
thin film type have been widely studied.
However, only the MIM and D2R two-terminal nonlinear
devices are in practical use. The MIM two-terminal
nonlinear device (hereinafter, referred to as "the MIM
device") includes upper and lower electrodes interposing
an insulator therebetween. For example, the MIM
device disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
Nos. 61-32673 and 61-32674, and USP No. 4,413,883 is
explained. The lower electrode is formed of a thin Ta
film on a substrate or a base coating film formed
thereon. The insulator is formed by the anodization of
the surface of the lower electrode. In this case, the
insulator is a Ta2O5 layer.
