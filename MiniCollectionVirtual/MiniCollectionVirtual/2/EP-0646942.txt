<ABSTRACT>
An amalgam (32) is accurately placed and 
retained in an optimized location in the exhaust tube (20) 

of an electrodeless SEF lamp (10) for operation at a 
mercury vapor pressure in the optimum range from 

approximately four to seven millitorr by forming a 
dimple (22) in the exhaust tube (20) and using a dose locating 

member (30) to locate and retain the amalgam (32) on the side of 
the dimple (22) away from the core of the lamp (10) after 

filling the lamp (10). As an alternative, two dimples (22a,22b) may 
be situated on opposite sides of the exhaust tube (20) for 

performing the same function as, but with less depth 
than, the single dimple (22). In another alternative 

embodiment, first and second dimple configurations (40',42') are 
formed in the exhaust tube (20) after tip-off thereof, each 

dimple configuration (40',42') including either one or two 
dimples (40a',40b',42a',42b'). The second dimple configuration (42') 

is spaced 
apart from the first dimple configuration (40') along the 

length of the exhaust tube (20). In this way, the amalgam (32) 
may be initially positioned farther from the tip-off 

region (24), thereby avoiding problems during tipping off 
of the exhaust tube (20), such as loss of mercury from the 

lamp (10), or quenching of the tip which could cause stress 
cracks. After tip-off, the second dimple 

configuration (42') allows for placement of the amalgam (32) 
closer to, or preferably in contact with, the tip of 

the sealed exhaust tube (20), i.e., the coolest location in 
the exhaust tube (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
fluorescent lamps and, more particularly, to accurate 
placement and retention of an amalgam in a solenoidal 
electric field fluorescent discharge lamp for 
optimally controlling mercury vapor pressure therein, 
which amalgam placement and retention do not interfere 
with lamp processing and furthermore are maintained 
during lamp operation, regardless of lamp orientation. The optimum mercury vapor pressure for 
production of 253.7 nm (2537 Å) radiation to excite a phosphor 
coating in a fluorescent lamp is approximately six 
millitorr, corresponding to a mercury reservoir 
temperature of approximately 40°C. Conventional 
tubular fluorescent lamps operate at a power density 
(i.e., typically measured as power input per phosphor 
area) and in a fixture configured to ensure operation 
of the lamp at or about a mercury vapor pressure of 0.80 Pa 
(six millitorr) (typically in a range from approximately  
 
0.53 to 0.93 N/m2 (4 to 7 millitorr)); that is, the lamp and 
fixture are designed such that the coldest spot of the 
fluorescent lamp is approximately 40°C. Compact 
fluorescent lamps, however, including electrodeless 
solenoidal electric field (SEF) fluorescent discharge 
lamps, operate at higher power densities with the cold 
spot temperature typically exceeding 50°C. As a 
result, the mercury vapor pressure is higher than the 
optimum four to seven millitorr range, and the 
luminous output of the lamp is decreased. One approach to controlling the mercury 
vapor pressure in an SEF lamp is to use an alloy 
capable of absorbing mercury from its gaseous phase in 
varying amounts, depending upon temperature 
,conditions. Alloys capable of forming amalgams with 
mercury have been found to be particularly useful. 
The mercury vapor pressure of such an amalgam at a 
given temperature is lower than the mercury vapor 
pressure of pure liquid mercury. Unfortunately, accurate placement and 
retention of an amalgam to achieve a mercury vapor 
pressure in the optimum range in an SEF lamp are 
difficult. For stable long-term operation, the 
amalgam should be placed and retained in a relatively 
cool location with minimal temperature variation. Of 
course, to achieve the desired beneficial effects of 
an amalgam in an SEF lamp, the amalgam should maintain 
its composition and location during lamp processing 
and manufacturing steps as well as during lamp 
operation. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an 
SEF lamp having a properly constituted amalgam that is 
accurately
