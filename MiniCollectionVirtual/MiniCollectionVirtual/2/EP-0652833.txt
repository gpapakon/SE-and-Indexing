<ABSTRACT>
A paint film includes an extruded clear coat layer (14), a liner layer (12) releasably attached to the outer surface of the clear coat layer to assist in injection molding of the paint film to a substrate, a color layer (16) on the other side of the clear coat layer from the liner layer, a reinforcing layer (18) on the other side of the color layer from the clear coat layer, and an optional bonding layer (20) on the other side of the reinforcing layer from the color layer. The paint film may be applied by injection molding methods including applying a paint film to a deeply-drawn injection molded part during molding without the use of preformed inserts. Slides may be used to provide undercut surfaces on the part that are covered by paint film. Contiguous pieces of different paint films may be applied to a substrate during molding and paint film may be applied to opposite surfaces of a substrate during molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PAINT FILM AND METHODS FOR ITS MANUFACTUREBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe invention relates to paint films used in surfacing objects such as exterior automobile parts. The invention also relates to methods of manufacturing and applying such paint films to a substrate.Description of the Related Art Exterior automobile body panels, trim components, and similar parts have traditionally been spray painted to provide the desired appearance and surface protection. The resulting paint coatings typically provide chemical resistance to automobile fluids, abrasion resistance and weatherability (i.e., they do not undergo ultraviolet degradation) .In recent years, it has been proposed to provide exterior surface paint coatings by prefabricating free-standing multi-layer films that are adhered to the surfaces of the parts, and there has been some commercial use of these films on certain exterior automobile parts. Such free-standing films avoid the environmental problems associated with evaporating paint solvents and eliminate the need for additional paint facilities and the equipment, ovens, sludge disposal, and emission control systems associated therewith. The use of such free-standing films also permits integration of part manufacture and surface finishing, improvements in appearance (e.g., avoiding coating problems, crazing, and adhesion 

problems that can exist with paint) , and the use of substrate materials that are difficult to paint.Examples of such paint films are described in Johnson et al . U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,589 and in Ellison et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,931,324; 4,943,680; and 4,810,540. The paint films of these patents each include an outer clear coat layer and a pigmented layer formed by casting on a carrier layer and a bonding layer thereunder to attach to a substrate. The Johnson et al. paint film also had a reinforcing layer between the pigmented layer and the bonding layer. Johnson et al. mention applying the paint film to a substrate by vacuum application, thermo-pressure forming and injection molding. The Ellison et al . patents describe adhering the paint film to a supporting substrate by known laminating or bonding techniques such as thermofor ing.The application of a paint film to a part or object while the part is being injection molded is advantageous because a separate laminating step or other application method is not required. The film can be placed between the mold sections in its natural flat(planar) shape and formed and bonded to the contour of the part during
