<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device.Various constructions for achieving electrical
connection to semiconductor integrated circuits are
described in JP-A-1 145 842 and JP-A-63 255 953.A dynamic RAM may have its memory circuit divided
into blocks to improve the processing speed.FIG. 23 is a structural diagram of a dynamic RAM
chip with the memory circuit divided into blocks, and
FIG. 24 is a diagram of the equivalent circuit of the RAM
chip.As shown in FIG. 23, a plurality of memory circuit
blocks MB1 to MB4 are provided in a semiconductor chip
1. Power supplies are needed to operate the memory
circuit blocks MB1 to MB4. Conventionally, one high-potential
power supply pad 2 and one low-potential
power supply pad 3 are provided at the boundary of the
chip 1, with a high-potential power line 4 and a low-potential
power line 5 respectively connected to the
pads 2 and 3. Those power lines 4 and 5 are connected
to the memory circuit blocks MB1 to MB4 to provide a low
potential VSS and a high potential VCC required for
their operation.This structure, in the equivalent circuit shown in
FIG. 24, has resistor elements 6-1 to 6-4 connected in
parallel between the power lines 4 and 5, each resistor
element having a series circuit of a switch and a load.
The combined resistance in the parallel circuit in this 
memory circuit varies depending on the ON/OFF status of
each switch or the ON/OFF status of each of the memory
circuit blocks MB1-MB4, causing a variation in supply
voltage.It is apparent that the integration of the memory
circuit blocks MB1-MB4 will be improved and the sensitivities
of the elements constituting the memory circuit
will be improved accordingly. Even a slight
variation in supply voltage may therefore cause the
memory circuit blocks MB1-MB4 to malfunction.To overcome such a shortcoming, the present inventors
attempted to divide the power supply for each
memory circuit block.In the attempt, a single memory circuit block in
the equivalent circuit is simply connected in series
between the power lines, thus overcoming the problem of
the parallel connection to cause a variation in combined
resistance. A variation in supply voltage could therefore
be suppressed.The provision of a power supply for each memory
circuit block however increases the number of pads. The
increasing number of pads inevitably increases the
number of leads (number of pins), which requires that
the package for a semiconductor chip should be enlarged.
The larger package means the enlargement of the semiconductor
