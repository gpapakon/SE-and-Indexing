<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
digital oscilloscope with using a color plane display 
device and to a data display method in such a digital 
oscilloscope. More specifically, the present invention 
is directed to a digital oscilloscope with using a color 
dot matrix plane display device and also to a data 
display method performed in such a digital oscilloscope. Oscilloscopes have been widely utilized to 
observe waveforms, and therefore are very useful in 
research/development, production, maintenance, and repair 
works. As is well known in this technical field, a 
cathode-ray tube (CRT) has been conventionally employed 
as the display device of this oscilloscope. For instance, such conventional oscilloscopes 
have been proposed in which the color CRT is employed, or 
the color LCD shutter is provided in front on the CRT 
(see JP-A-53-84789, JP-A-54-8566, JP-U-58-14171). When 
such oscilloscopes are employed, the waveforms can be 
displayed with different color representations in the 
respective display channels, which can provide very easy 
waveform observations. However, generally speaking, cathode-ray tubes  
 
necessarily require relatively long lengths from screen 
surfaces up to electron guns, as compared with the screen 
sizes. Accordingly this fact may impede compactness of 
the conventional oscilloscopes. On the other hand, the compact/light weight 
digital oscilloscopes have been proposed with employment 
of the liquid crystal displays (LCD). These conventional 
digital oscilloscopes use the monochromatic LCDs. For 
instance, JP-A-4-143664 discloses such a digital 
oscilloscope with using the active matrix type LCD as the 
display device. This prior art proposes that the switch 
elements for driving the pixel electrode group are 
fabricated by way of the silicon single crystal thin-film 
layer in the device, and such an LCD usable in the 
oscilloscope is manufactured. As previously explained, the color representation 
of signal waveforms cannot be apparently realized by 
employing the monochromatic LCD exclusively utilized in 
the oscilloscope. To perform a color representation of 
waveform data, either an LCD for a computer display 
screen (so-called "office automation type LCD") is 
employed, or a so-termed audio/visual type color dot 
matrix type plane display device is employed. However, 
although in the office automation type LCD, a designation 
of color can be made in correspondence with the waveform 
display position, there are many drawbacks. That is, 
since one pixel is
