<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for cleaning the exhaust gases from internal combustion engines, especially diesel engines, comprises a monolithic body having longitudinally extending, open throughchannels coated with a surface-enlarging washcoat layer which contains one or more catalytically active precious metals. In order to reduce the tendency of the catalyst to oxidise and absorb (be enriched with) sulphur dioxide, the washcoat layer of the catalyst is based on silicon carbide and is substantially free from aluminium oxide. A method for preparing the catalyst, the use of the catalyst, as well as an exhaust gas cleaning system and a motor vehicle equipped with the catalyst, are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for cleaning 
exhaust gases from internal combustion engines, especially 
diesel engines. The catalyst comprises a monolithic body 
having longitudinally extending, open throughchannels 
coated with a surface-enlarging washcoat layer which is 
based on silicon carbide and one or more catalytically 
active precious metals. The invention also concerns a 
method for preparing the catalyst, the use of the 
catalyst, as well as an exhaust gas cleaning system and a 
motor vehicle equipped with the catalyst. Exhaust gases from diesel engines contain large 
amounts of soot particles, largely consisting of hydrocarbons, 
sulphuric acid and water in varying proportions, 
as well as residues from lubricating oil and engine wear. 
Usually, the exhaust gases also contain sulphur dioxide. 
Many systems for cleaning diesel exhaust gases have a 
particle filter, which increases the pressure drop in the 
exhaust system. In addition, fairly complicated techniques 
are needed to avoid clogging of the filter. Exhaust gas cleaning systems with no particle filter 
require the presence of a catalyst able to oxidise the 
hydrocarbon compounds in the particles to carbon dioxide. 
As is well-known, use can be made of a catalyst in the 
form of a monolithic body having throughchannels whose 
walls are coated with a surface-enlarging washcoat layer 
which is formed of or based on aluminium oxide and is 
impregnated with precious metals, e.g. platinum and/or 
palladium. However, such a catalyst also oxidises a 
substantial amount of the sulphur dioxide to sulphur 
trioxide, which is more corrosive as well as more harmful 
to the environment. At low temperatures, sulphur dioxide 
and sulphur trioxide may, in addition, be absorbed by the 
catalyst, to be desorbed later on when the temperature of 
the exhaust gases rises. When the temperature of the 
catalyst increases rapidly, the amount of sulphur dioxide  
 
and sulphur trioxide desorbed may be considerable. Among 
other things, this manifests itself as an increase in 
the emission of particles from the catalyst. A further 
problem arises when inorganic residues of lubricating oil 
additives, such as compounds of phosphorus, zinc, calcium, 
magnesium and sulphur, are present in the exhaust gases 
and are enriched in the catalyst, thereby considerably 
reducing the catalytic activity in course of time. EP-B-0 432 534 discloses a monolithic catalyst for 
cleaning diesel exhaust gases. This catalyst has a surface-enlarging 
layer containing
