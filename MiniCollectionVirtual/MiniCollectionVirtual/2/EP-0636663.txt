<ABSTRACT>
The curable compositions of this invention 
comprise a blend of an organic fluorinated rubber, a 

non-fluorinated diorganopolysiloxane gum and a 
fluorosilicone oil containing silicon-bonded 

perfluoroalkylethyl radicals wherein the perfluoroalkyl 
portion of the radicals contain at least 4 carbon atom. 

These compositions are characterized by an excellent 
compatibility between the organic rubber and the 

diorganopolysiloxane gum, and yield cured elastomers 
with excellent physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blends of a 
fluorinated organic rubber and an organosiloxane 
rubber. Organic fluorinated rubbers exhibit excellent 
heat resistance, oil resistance, weather resistance, 
and mechanical strength, making them useful in those 
fields where such properties are critical. A 
disadvantage of these rubbers is their poor, 
low-temperature flexibility. To overcome this problem, 
fluorinated organic rubbers, also referred to as 
fluororubbers, have been blended with organosiloxane 
rubbers, also referred to as silicone rubbers, which 
exhibit excellent low-temperature properties. The inherently poor compatibility between 
fluororubber and silicone rubber makes it extremely 
difficult to mix these two rubbers into a homogeneous 
mixture. In addition, the processability of the 
resulting mixture is very poor. Numerous methods have been proposed for 
preparing homogeneous fluororubber/silicone rubber 
mixtures. For example, JP-A 49-81444 [81,444/1974] 
teaches addition of acid acceptors such as magnesium 
oxide during blending of fluororubbers with silicone 
rubbers. However, the magnesium oxide can induce 
depolymerization of the silicone rubber, and prevent 
the final cured rubber molding from exhibiting good 
physical properties. JP-A 4-180930 [180,930/1992] discloses 
blending of fluororubbers with silicone rubbers in the 
presence of a diorganopolysiloxane containing at both 
terminal positions the I(CF₂)mCONHC₃H₆- group wherein m 
is an integer with a value of zero to 4. This 
ingredient improves the compatibility between the two 
types of rubbers. The disadvantage of this approach is  
 
its cost, because synthesis of diorganopolysiloxane is 
extremely difficult. Another disadvantage is the 
reduced heat stability of the final cured rubber 
molding. As a result of extensive research, we have 
found that the addition of a particular class of 
fluorosilicone oils will compatibilize an organic 
fluororubber with a gum type silicone rubber, thereby 
producing a homogeneous, cured rubber molding with 
excellent physical properties is thereby produced. Suitable fluorosilicone oil comprise liquid 
polyorganosiloxane wherein each of the silicon atoms is 
bonded to a perfluoroalkylethyl radical containing at 
least four fluorinated carbon atoms. Such oils provide 
excellent compatibility between organic fluororubbers 
and high consistency polyorganosiloxanes. The present invention provides a blended 
rubber composition comprising:
