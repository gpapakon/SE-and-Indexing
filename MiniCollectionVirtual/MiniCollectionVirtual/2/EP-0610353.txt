Pressure regulation device for a hydraulic system 
comprising at least one generator (30) of fluid under 

pressure, a hydraulic actuator (28) and a reservoir (32) 
of fluid under low pressure, and including an electro-valve 

controlled by a computer and comprising in a casing 
(8) an electrical coil (10) and a sliding magnetic core 

(12) controlling a slide valve (16) sliding in a bore 
provided in a body (18), the slide valve (16) determining 

two chambers (22, 36) arranged on either side of the 
slide valve (16) in the bore, the slide valve comprising 

a hydraulic chamber (40) communicating with the hydraulic 
actuator (28) and determining a reaction force adding 

itself to the force produced by the coil (10), against a 
prestressed resilient means (20), characterized in that 

the chamber (40) is delimited by a bore (41) made in the 
slide valve (16), an end part (43a) of a sleeve (43), a 

rod (42) and a cup (60) for leaktightness between the rod 
(42) and the bore (41) of the slide valve (16). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a radial drilling (44) causes the chamber (40) to 

communicate with a groove (34) provided at the periphery 
of the slide valve (16). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the sleeve (43) bears against a wall (27) of the 

casing (8) or against a part (46) integral with the 
casing (8). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the sleeve (43) slides in a substantially leaktight 

manner in the bore (41) of the slide valve (16) and 
slidably receives in substantially leaktight manner the 

rod (42). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the reaction force is exerted on the annular surface 

(S) of the end (43a) of the sleeve (43). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that a spring (64) for return of a ball valve (50, 52) is 

arranged between the cup (60) and a step (66) of the rod  
 

(42). 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the cup (60) is retained by a pin (56) passing 

through radial apertures (54) in the slide valve (16). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the ball (50) of the ball valve (50, 52) is contained 

in a slightly floating manner in a recess (48) at 
one end of the rod (42).
