<ABSTRACT>
In an electronic position encoder (or other panel 
control) of the type having a shaft-retracted position for 

storage and a shaft-extended position for adjustment, an 
anti-backlash coupling substantially eliminates backlash 

between a rotor and a shaft. The anti-backlash coupling 
includes a first wedge member(108) fixedly coupled to the 

shaft (102) and a second wedge member (208) fixedly coupled 
to the rotor (204). The second wedge member (208) is 

adapted to mate with the first wedge member (108) when the 
shaft (102) is in the extended position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of panel control, in particular of rotary position
encoders for electronic instruments, and more specifically,
to rotary position encoders of the type having a shaft-retracted
position for storage and a shaft-extended position
for adjustment.Position encoders are used in a variety of
applications for electronic instruments. A position encoder
converts a rotary motion caused by a user turning a knob to
a varying electrical signal which can be used to adjust an
operational parameter of an electronic instrument. For
example, a position encoder may be used to adjust the volume
in an automobile audio system.In one type of rotary position encoder, the encoder
shaft is movable longitudinally or axially between a
retracted position and an extended position. In the
retracted position, the encoder shaft may be stored such
that it extends only slightly from the front panel of an
instrument. In the extended position, the shaft moves
longitudinally out from the panel for ease of adjustment.A spring loaded toggle system allows the shaft to
move between the two positions by simply depressing the end
of the shaft. The capability of providing both rotary and
longitudinal movement is achieved by keying the shape of the
shaft and the rotor plate within the encoder so that the
rotor will turn with the shaft while permitting the shaft to
move freely through the rotor in an axial or longitudinal
direction.In order to accommodate both rotary coupling and
longitudinal movement while accounting for manufacturing
tolerances, a minimum amount of "clearance" or imprecision
must be present between the size of the keyed opening in the
rotor and the size of the keyed shaft. This imprecision
results in what is known in the industry as "backlash" in
the rotary coupling between the shaft and the rotor. This 
is undesirable in most applications either because of the
need for positional accuracy or the perceived lack of
quality in the tactile feel of the device.DE-A-1 750 181 describes a a rotary control having a
control knob mounted on a shaft. The distal end of the shaft
carries a toothed member which is capable of engaging a
complementary toothed member. The shaft is moveable to
operate a current control switch.US-A-4 866 219 describes an encoder and switch assembly
including a first module containing contact and rotor
elements of an electrical encoder and a second module that
contains a switch. The modules are axially aligned and
joined together in tandem. The encoder and switch are
actuated by a

An apparatus for eliminating backlash in a panel control
of the type having a shaft-retracted position for storage

and a shaft-extended position for adjustment,

wherein the panel control includes a keyed shaft (102) and a
similarly keyed rotor (204) mounted on said shaft (102) such

that the rotor (204) rotates with the shaft while allowing
free longitudinal translation of the shaft through the

rotor, the apparatus comprising:

a first wedge means (108) fixedly coupled to said shaft
(102); and
a second wedge means (208) fixedly coupled to said rotor
(204) and adapted to mate with said first wedge means (108)

when the shaft (102) is in the extended position,
wherein mating of said first and second wedge means
(108,208) substantially eliminates rotational backlash

between said rotor and said shaft.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein:

one of said first and second wedge means (108,208)
comprises a first annulus having at least one outwardly

tapering extension which extends longitudinally toward the
rotor (204), substantially parallel to the shaft (102); and
the other of said wedge means (108,208) comprises a
second annulus having at least one inwardly tapering recess

configured and arranged to mate with said at least one
outwardly tapering extension of said first wedge means.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said second
wedge means is an integral part of the rotor (204).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein one of said
first and second wedge means (108,208) comprises two

outwardly tapering extensions disposed approximately 180°

apart on said first annulus, and the other of said wedge
means (108,208) comprises two inwardly tapering recesses 

disposed approximately 180° apart on said second annulus.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims comprising sense means (206,106) for sensing the

position of said rotor (204) and allowing electrical
detection thereof.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
further comprising:


a spring (118) configured and arranged to urge said first
wedge means into engagement with said second wedge means;

and
selective retention means (110,116) for alternately
restraining said spring (118) to maintain said shaft (102)

in the retracted position and allowing said spring (118) to
urge said first wedge means into engagement with said second

wedge means.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein said rotor
(204) comprises a substantially circular shaped disc having

a pattern (606,608,610) of conductive material disposed on
one side thereof, and wherein said sense means comprises a

plurality of conductive contact springs (206) held in ohmic
contact with said pattern of conductive material.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said keyed shaft (102) comprises a substantially

circular cross-section with two flat, substantially parallel
sides, and wherein said rotor (204) has a substantially

similar shaped opening.
