<ABSTRACT>
Described is an improved asbestos-free fiber reinforced 
material especially for use in the manufacture of gaskets, 

and the like, comprising (a) an elastomeric binder material 
and (b) acrylic fibers with a small diameter of up to about 

12 µm, and a minimum aspect ratio in the 20-50 range, so that 
the flexibility and the strength of the gaskets, shock 

mountings, timing belts, sealants, and the like made from 
such materials is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to asbestos-free acrylic fiber
reinforced material, especially useful for the production of
gaskets and the like.Asbestos fiber-containing articles such as gaskets, brake
linings, pneumatic tires, conveyor belts, timing belts, power
transmission couplings, shock absorbers, sealants, paints,
and the like, are well-known and have achieved significant
commercial success. Unfortunately, recent medical evidence
indicates that asbestos fibers can cause health hazards,
particularly when inhaled. These health hazard problems of
asbestos fibers are well-known also, and accordingly, the
industry has been searching for replacement compositions for
forming gaskets, and the like, which do not contain asbestos
fibers, but yet achieve substantially the same physical and
chemical properties.Acrylic fibers have been added to organic thermosetting
plastic matrices to improve one or more properties of the
matrices. For example, DeMaria and Relmond in
US-A-4,352,852, assigned to the same assignee as the instant
application, show that from about 10 to about 90 weight
percent of an acrylonitrile polymer fiber having a straight
tenacity of at least about 5.0 grams per 0.11 tex (denier),
reinforces thermosetting resins, such as polyesters and
peroxide curatives, much better than the widely used glass
fibers. The required tenacity is obtained by post stretching
a conventional wet spun acrylonitrile polymer fiber in steam
under pressure to obtain a higher than normal tenacity. The
fibers used are of conventional diameter, i.e., they are
"normal denier" fibers, having a diameter of about 20 µm
i.e., greater than about 12 µm. Greenman, et al, in US-A-4,423,109, describe fiber reinforced
rubber gasket materials, in which one of the fiber materials
can comprise glass fibers, and another can comprise
polyacrylics, e.g., polyacrylonitrile fibers. No preference
is stated or disclosed as between glass, on the one hand, or
polyacrylics, on the other, and nothing is suggested that
would teach using fibers with diameters in the "microdenier"
range, i.e., those less than 12 µm in diameter, and
especially from about 5 to about 10 µm in diameter.Many other proposals have been put forth to replace asbestos
fibers in a variety of end uses. Mention can be made, for
example of U.K. Patent No. 1,179,569 (tires); EPO Patent
Publication No. 0 511 838 (marine couplings and timing
belts); Research Disclosure No. RD 276096A (4/10/87) and
US-A-4,820,585 (sealants and coatings); and US-A- 4,330,442,
4,387,178, 4,423,109, and
