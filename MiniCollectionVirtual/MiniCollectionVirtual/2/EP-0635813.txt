<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a method of evaluating the flow of traffic of road vehicles, by an acoustic technique. The method consists:   . in defining analysis intervals of predetermined duration (Ti) in the course of which the sound signal is picked up, . in determining, for each of the analysis intervals, on the one hand, the difference between the maximum (Lmax) and minimum (Lmin) levels of the sound signal so as to determine a first acoustic indicator (P1) corresponding to the dynamic range of the signal and, on the other hand, a level (Lp) of the sound signal which is reached during a predetermined fraction of the duration (Ti) of the interval in question, for the purpose of defining a second acoustic indicator (P2) corresponding to the presence of vehicles on the roadway, . and in comparing the acoustic indicators (P1, P2) previously defined with datum values, so as to evaluate the state of the flow of the traffic.
