<ABSTRACT>
A kit is provided for creating simulated photographic prints using xerographic 
imaging. The kit comprsises a transparent substrate (25) suitable for having a reverse reading 

toner image fused thereto and a reflective backing sheet (116), the latter of which is coated 
with a heat activatable adhesive material for bonding the latter to the former. The kit further 

includes a rigid surface of tempered glass (100) upon which the transparent substrate (25) is 
supported during bonding. An abhesive member (120) is provided for covering the 

transparent substrate (25) during the process of making prints.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for producing continuous 
tone images with near photographic print qualities using xerography. In the practice of conventional xerography, it is the general procedure to form 
electrostatic latent images on a xerographic surface by first uniformly charging a charge 
retentive surface such as a photoreceptor. The charged area is selectively dissipated in 
accordance with a pattern of activating radiation corresponding to original images. The 
selective dissipation of the charge leaves a latent charge pattern on the imaging surface 
corresponding to the areas not exposed by radiation. This charge pattern is made visible by developing it with toner by passing the 
photoreceptor past one or more developer housings. In monochromatic imaging, the toner is 
generally comprises black thermoplastic powder particles which adhere to the charge pattern 
by electrostatic attraction. The developed image is then fixed to the imaging surface or is 
transferred to a receiving substrate such as plain paper to which it is fixed by suitable fusing 
techniques. Recently, there has been a great deal of effort directed to the development of color 
copiers/printers which utilize the xerographic process. Such efforts have resulted in the recent 
introduction of the Xerox™ 5775™ copier/printer and the Fuji XeroxA-Color 635 machine. The quality of color xerographic images on paper has approached the quality of color 
photographic prints. However, color xerographic prints fall short because they do not have the 
uniform gloss, dynamic range or brilliance typical of photographic prints. Nor do xerographic 
prints have the feel of photographic prints because the paper usually used is too lightweight 
and too limp. Typically the surface of color toner images is irregular, therefore, rather rough or 
lumpy. The behavior of incident white light vis-a-vis such color images is believed to be as 
follows: Some of the white light incident on the substrate carrying the color toner images 
specularly reflects off the substrate. Some of the light goes down into the paper, scatters around and comes back out in 
various directions, some through the toner and some not. Because the toner surface is rough or irregular some of the light incident thereon is 
reflected off the toner in various directions. Some of the light incident on the irregular toner surfaces passes through the toner 
into the paper and comes back out in various directions. White light becomes colored due to selective
