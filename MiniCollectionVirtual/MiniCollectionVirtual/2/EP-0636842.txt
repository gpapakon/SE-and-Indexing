<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for eliminating
humidity particularly from laundry.As known, in the last years there has been a widespread use
of implements for rapidly drying the laundry especially
during the winter or in rooms with no heating system and/or
located in areas with a high humidity level.These implements usually comprise an electric resistance
adapted to heat the surrounding air and a blower adapted to
blow the air heated by the resistance into the room where
the laundry is hung.These implements often require sliding plastic sheets
covering the laundry for preventing the dispersion of heat
and for concentrating the heat in the area where the drying
operation must be performed.It is easily understood that the conventional apparatus for
drying the laundry increases the room temperature and causes
the evaporation of the water contained in the laundry. The
evaporated water is dispersed in the room increasing the
humidity level of the room air.Consequently, because of the above, the laundry dries slower
and the air which is again aspirated by the apparatus will
eventually irreparably damage the apparatus.JP-A-02085623 and/or DE-A-3034168 and/or GB-A-2252401 disclose
a device for eliminating humidity which comprises means for dehumidifying
the air and means for heating the dehumified air at a selected temperature
as disclosed in the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. The above patents do
not teach a condenser and an evaporator both arranged in a container case
having at least one aperture for providing a thermal divide as claimed in
the characterizing part of claim 1.The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the above
described inconveniences of the prior art by providing a 
device for eliminating humidity, particularly from laundry,
which device may also function as a dehumidifier adapted to
eliminate the humidity from the room where it is installed.Within the above aim, an important object of the invention
is to provide a device for eliminating humidity,
particularly from laundry, which may operate without any
type of problem, whether mechanical or electrical, in rooms
with a very high humidity level or in rooms with very low
temperature or vice versa.A further object of the invention to provide a device for
eliminating humidity, particularly from laundry, having a
high flexibility of use being usable as a simple thermofan
for heating a room, as a dehumidifier for eliminating the
humidity from the room, or as a laundry drier, acting, in
this last case, at the same time as a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device for eliminating humidity, particularly from laundry, comprising a
body (2) having inside in combination a means (3) for dehumidifying the

air and means (4) for heating said dehumidified air at a selected
temperature, said means (3) for dehumidifying the air comprising a

compressor (5) for compressing a gas, at least one condenser (6) for
condensing said gas, a laminating member (7) for said gas, at least one

evaporator (8), at least one ventilator (9) for sucking air to be dehumidified
from a first aperture (10) of said body, said aperture being arranged in front

of said evaporator, and for delivering air from a second aperture (11), of
said body, arranged in front of said condenser and said ventilator, and a

tank (13) for collecting condensate produced by said evaporator,
characterized in that said condenser and said evaporator are both of the

same type with flaps and being rigidly connected to one another and being
both arranged in a container case (14) having on its lateral sides (15) at

least one aperture (16) for providing a thermal divide adapted to prevent

heat transfer from said condenser to said evaporator so that said condenser
and said evaporator are spaced apart one from the other of a selected

distance and are so arranged in said case as to allow the simultaneous
expanding of the tubes and the simultaneous welding of their curves (18)

and pins (19) during their assembly into said case.
Device, according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises switching means (30, 31, 32) for switching

the rotation direction of said ventilator for sucking air
from said second aperture and for delivering air from said

first aperture.
Device, according to claim 2, characterized in that said
air sucked from said second aperture is heated by said

condenser and hits said evaporator for defrosting said
evaporator.
Device, according to claim 2, characterized in that said
switching means comprises a switch (30), of the rotation of

said ventilator, said switch being activated by a probe (31)
arranged on that evaporator and/or on the inlet of said

compressor and/or on said first aperture.
Device, according to claim 4, characterized in that said
switch is activated by a timer (32) for selected time

intervals.
Device, according to claim 1, characterized in
that said heating means (4) of said air are arranged between

said condenser and said ventilator. 
Device, according to claim 1, characterized in that said
ventilator has a rotation speed variable according to which

of said means for dehumidifying or said means for heating
have been activated.
