<ABSTRACT>
A display device is presented for a computer system having a system 
unit (5), a data entry device (110), and a communication link (140) for 

transferring data signals between the data entry device (110) and the 
system unit (5). The display device has a display screen. A drive circuit 

(134) is provided for generating an image on the display screen in 
response to an input video signal (R,G,B,H,V) from the system unit 

(5). Detector means (133) permits detection of data signals travelling 
between the data entry device (110) and the system unit (5) on the 

communication link (140). 
When no data signals have been detected for a predetermined length of 
time, a control circuit (131) at least partially disables the drive 

circuit (134), thus reducing power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display with power management 
means responsive to a data entry to a host computer system. Conventional computer systems generally include a computer system 
unit, a visual display unit for displaying computer data generated in the 
computer system unit, and a keyboard for entering data to the computer 
system unit. In some conventional computer systems, power management in 
the display is provided by detection of keyboard activity in the system 
unit. If the operator leaves such a computer system unattended for a 
period of time, the system unit instructs the display to operate in a 
standby mode in which the brightness and/or the size of the image 
displayed is reduced. The system unit instructs the display to restore 
the brightness and/or size of the image displayed on detection of the 
next keyboard entry made by the operator. In other conventional computer 
systems, such power management cannot be provided in the display because 
the system unit has no way of communicating instructions to the display. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided 
a display device for a computer system having a system unit, a data entry 
device, and a communication link for transferring data signals between 
the data entry device and the system unit, the display device comprising: 
a display screen; a drive circuit for generating an image on the display 
screen in response to an input video signal from the system unit; and 
detector means for detecting data signals travelling between the data 
entry device and the system unit on the communication link. Preferably, the communication link of the computer system includes 
a communication cable, and the detector means comprises a sensor for 
receiving at least a portion of the cable to detect data signals 
travelling along the cable. The sensor can comprise an electromagnetic 
sense coil through which the cable can be passed. Alternatively, the 
sensor can comprise a hall effect probe for mounting against a side of 
the cable. In a preferred embodiment of he present invention, the display 
device comprises first attachment means for connection to the data entry  
 
device, second attachment means for connection to the system unit; and 
coupling means for connecting the first attachment means to the second 
attachment means to complete the communication link between the data 
entry device and the system unit. The detector means can be connected to 
the coupling means. The first attachment means can comprise a
