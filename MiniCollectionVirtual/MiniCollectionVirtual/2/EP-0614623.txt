<ABSTRACT>
A toe-cap for a safety shoe or boot is disclosed. In order 
to provide a toe-cap which is light and has sufficient strength, 

the toe-cap is made of a composite material comprising a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin (7) and at least one wire mesh 

(4) having a size of 7 to 200 meshes and embedded in the fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin. In a preferred embodiment, the 

fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin comprises a long-fiber 
reinforced thermoplastic layer (1) having reinforcing long 

fibers (5) incorporated therein and a short-fiber reinforced 
thermoplastic layer (2) having reinforcing short fibers (6) 

incorporated therein, and the wire mesh (4) is embedded in the 
short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic layer (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toe-cap or boxtoe for use in 
safety foot wear such as shoes and boots (hereinafter referred 
to collectively as "shoe") to reinforce structurally the toe of 
a shoe and enhance the safety of the shoe. Heretofore, the toe-caps of safety shoes made of steel have 
been exclusively accepted for actual use because of appreciation 
of the extreme importance of the strength of the uppers of 
safety shoes for protection of the wearer's toes against 
accidental heavy impact. The safety shoes which use toe-caps made of steel, however, 
entail the problem of handicapping the wearer's mobility by an 
inevitable increase of weight of the safety shoes owing to the 
use of steel as the material for the toe-caps. Recently, for 
the sake of decreasing the weights of safety shoes, toe-caps 
having plastic layers superposed one each on both sides of a 
steel core member thereof have been proposed in published 
Japanese Utility Model Application, KOKAI (Early Publication) 
No. SHO 64-32609, for example. The toe-caps having plastic layers superposed on a steel 
core member thereof, however, possibly fail to accomplish their 
object as a manufactured article because they are liable to 
entail interfacial separation between the steel core member and 
the plastic layers. Further, since these toe-caps are made of 
steel, their manufacture turns out to be a troublesome work. 
Moreover, the toe-caps have a large weight because their core  
 
members are made of steel. EP-A-0 507 322 discloses a toe-cap for safety foot wear 
comprising a fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin layer 
reinforced with a metallic random mat. In view of the problem encountered by the prior art as 
described above, the present invention aims to provide a toe-cap 
for a safety shoe which is light and so strong as to resist 
compression. More specifically, the present invention aims to 
provide a novel light toe-cap for a safety shoe which passes the 
standard for toe-caps for safety shoes [Japanese Industrial 
Standard (JIS) T 8101 "Safety Leather Shoes, Type S"]. These objects are attained by the toe-cap or boxtoe 
according to the present invention. According to the present 
invention, it is suggested that in a toe-cap for a safety foot 
wear having a domed shape adapted to lie over the toes of the 
wearer and an open end to receive the toes, the toe-cap is 
formed of a composite material comprising a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin and at least one wire mesh or woven metallic 
wire having a size of 7 to 200 meshes and
