<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a disposable article and, more 
particularly, to a growth adjustable disposable absorbent 
article. Currently, disposable absorbent articles find widespread use 
in infant and child care and have generally replaced reusable 
cloth absorbent articles. A typical disposable absorbent 
article generally comprises a composite structure including a 
topsheet, a backsheet, and an absorbent between the topsheet 
and backsheet. These articles usually include some type of 
fastening system for fitting the article onto the wearer. Although current disposable baby diapers have been generally 
accepted by the public, these diapers still have need of 
improvement in specific areas. For example, mothers of 
newborns between the age of zero and generally about four 
months are aware of the irritation that current disposable 
diapers cause with the umbilical cord during the first month 
of the newborn's existence. Naturally, any irritation of the 
umbilical cord is a discomfort to the newborn and of anxious 
concern to the mother. Another serious concern to mothers is 
the tenderness of the newborn's skin and, thus, its 
sensitivity to even slight pressures or rubbing actions that 
can cause irritation and red marking. With current diapers, 
this irritation or pressure is caused by leg elastics that 
press the diaper tightly against the newborn's skin to 
prevent urine leakage. It also can occur at the waist area 
where the back ears of the diaper are adhesively attached 
tightly to the front section of the diaper. Thus, it can be 
appreciated that current diapers do not provide an optimum 
absorbent article for newborn babies.  In addition to concerns for the newborn's healing umbilical 
cord area and tender, sensitive skin is the relatively rapid 
growth of the newborn between the time when he or she is born 
to approximately the age of four months. During this time, 
the newborn will grow in length and weight from about six 
pounds to about fifteen pounds, thus posing a problem to the 
mother, since the diaper the mother was first using was sized 
for the baby at birth, while the next size diaper may not be 
appropriate to a newborn during this rapid growth stage. 
Thus, it would be desirable to have a diaper exclusively 
designed for a newborn, between the age of zero and about 
four months, that provides adjustability in size to 
accommodate this rapid growth. This object is solved by the growth adjustable absorbent 
article of any one of independent claims 1, 11 or 14. Further
