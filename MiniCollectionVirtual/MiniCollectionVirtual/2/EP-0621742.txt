<ABSTRACT>
The housing consists of an upper part which comprises three separate cover caps (3, 8), the two lateral cover caps (8) being held by one lock each. The lock consists in each case of two lateral holding channels (24) which have a perpendicularly running groove (23) on the central cover cap, into which groove a perpendicular rib (22) engages on the inside of the longitudinal side wall (14) of the lateral cover cap (8). In addition, a central holding tongue (25) is attached to the top area (10) of the lateral cover cap (8), in the horizontal groove (26) of which central holding tongue a rib (27) engages on the outside of the narrow side wall (21) of the central cover cap (3).

<CLAIMS>
Housing for an electric lamp ballast having the
following features:


the housing has an essentially cuboidal shape with
a rectangular base face and is assembled from a

bottom part and a top part,
the bottom part of the housing comprises a base
plate (1) and a circumferential edge (2),
the top part of the housing is assembled from three
separate blanking caps (3, 7, 8), it being the case

that
the middle blanking cap (3) comprises a covering
surface (4) and four side walls (5, 6) and surrounds

the ballast, and
two blanking caps (7, 8) arranged to the side of the
middle blanking cap (3) respectively comprise a

covering surface (9, 10) and three side walls (11,
12, 13; 14, 15, 16) and surround the electric terminals,

characterized in that the lateral blanking caps (7, 8)
are held in each case by a locking device which is

assembled from the following parts:

two lateral retaining lugs (24) which project beyond
the ends of the two longitudinal side walls (5, 6)

of the middle blanking cap (3) and have on the
outside a vertically extending groove (23) in which

a rib (22), likewise extending vertically, engages
in the inside on the longitudinal side walls (11,

13; 14, 16) of the lateral blanking caps (7, 8), and
a middle retaining lug (25) which is attached to the
covering surface (10) of the lateral blanking caps 

(8) and faces the narrow side wall (21) of the
middle blanking cap, having a horizontally extending

groove (26) in which a horizontally extending rib
(27) engages on the outside on the narrow side wall

(21) of the middle blanking cap (3).
Housing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the covering surfaces (4, 9, 10) of the middle

blanking cap (3) and of the lateral blanking caps (7, 8)
in each case have mutually abutting indentations (17, 18;

19, 20) in the middle at their neighbouring ends.
Housing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the vertically extending groove (23) of the retaining

lugs (24) is widened at its upper end in the direction
of the lateral blanking caps (8).
Housing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that in the inside on their two longitudinal side walls

(14) the lateral blanking caps (8) additionally each have
a projecting retaining lug (29) with a rib (30), the rib

engaging in a groove (31) in the longitudinal-side edge
(2) of the bottom part.
