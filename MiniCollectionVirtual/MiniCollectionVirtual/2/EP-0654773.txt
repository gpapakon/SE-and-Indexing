<ABSTRACT>
A signal acquisition device is proposed which contains a sensor arrangement (24) having at least one sensor (10) and an evaluation circuit (25) which is spatially separate from the sensor arrangement (24). There is located between the sensor arrangement (24) and the evaluation circuit (25) a connecting line (22) via which the power which is required by the sensor arrangement (24) is supplied and the signal transmission to the evaluation circuit (25) takes place. The sensor arrangement (24) contains a signal-converting device (17) which converts an analog signal (11) output by the sensor (10) into a corresponding digital signal (18) having a predetermined pulse duty ratio (mark-to-space factor) and/or a predetermined frequency which serves to control a current sink (19). The current sink (19) modulates the current flowing in the connecting line (22) by establishing two discrete different values.

Signal acquisition device having an evaluation
circuit (25) and having a sensor arrangement (24) which

is set off from the evaluation circuit (25) and
contains at least one sensor (10), having a line (22)

which connects the evaluation circuit (25) and the
sensor arrangement (24) and which is provided for

supplying power to the sensor arrangement (23) and for
transmitting signals, having a current sink (19) which

is connected to the connecting line (22), the sensor
arrangement (24) containing a signal shaper (17) which

converts an analogue signal (11), made available by the
sensor (10), into a digital signal (18) with a variable

pulse-duty factor and/or variable frequency, which
signal (11) is fed to the current sink (11) which

switches the current flowing in the connecting line
(24) on and off in accordance with the digital signal

(18), characterized in that the evaluation circuit (25)
controls an electric motor (40) via an output stage

circuit (28), and in that the current flowing in the
connecting line (22) determines the ratio of turn-on

time to the turn-off time of a transistor of the output
stage circuit (28), as a result of which the transistor

switches the motor current on and off.
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sensor (10) provided is a

temperature sensor.
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the connecting line (22) is 

connected to an evaluation resistor (39) which is
arranged in the evaluation circuit (25) and at which a

voltage drop, corresponding to the current flowing in
the connecting line (22), occurs.
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the connecting line (22) is

connected to a current mirror circuit which is arranged
in the evaluation circuit (25) and outputs a voltage

which corresponds to the current flowing in the
connecting line (22).
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the current sink (19) which is

arranged in the sensor arrangement (24) is designed as
a current source circuit which allows an impressed

current to flow independently of the potential
occurring in the connecting line (22).
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the current sink (19) contains a

voltage limiter diode (21) which limits the potential
occurring in the connecting line (22) to a predefined,

lower value.

characterized in that both the evaluation circuit (25)

with the output stage circuit (28) and the electric
motor (40) are accommodated in a common housing (42).

and 2, characterized in that the sensor arrangement

(24) is in thermal contact with a part (41) whose
temperature is to be sensed, and in that the electric

motor (40) drives a fan (43).
Signal acquisition device according to Claim 8,
characterized by use in a motor vehicle.
