<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for removing fiber waste from the 
knitting instrumentalities of a circular knitting 

machine (10) including an air jet (41) for blowing a high 
velocity stream of air thereonto, means mounting the 

air jet for rotation coaxially with the rotary cylinder (14) 
of the circular knitting machine, drive means 

independent of the drive of the circular knitting 
machine (10) for rotating the air jet (41) in one direction for a 

predetermined distance or time interval and for then 
reversing the direction of rotation for a predetermined 

distance or time interval, and air supply means which 
supplies compressed air to the air jet (41) while 

accommodating the different directions of rotation 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to circular
knitting machines and more particularly to apparatus
for removing fiber waste, such as dust, lint and the
like, from the knitting instrumentalities of a circular
knitting machine.The high speed operation of circular knitting
machines can generate considerable fiber waste, such as
dust, lint and/or flock, from the yarns being knitted
to form the fabric. Such fiber waste tends to
accumulate on the knitting machine parts, particularly
on the knitting section thereof, e.g. yarn carriers,
cylinder, dial or sinker cap and the needles and/or
sinkers. Unless quickly removed, such fiber waste can
be knit into the fabric which will substantially reduce
the quality thereof and can cause damage to the
knitting instrumentalities, e.g. needle breakage.Various types of cleaning devices for such
circular knitting machines have been proposed. The
most common of these devices include air blowing
nozzles for directing high velocity streams of air
against the knitting instrumentalities. Examples of
such cleaning devices are disclosed in United States 
Patent Nos. 4,691,536 and 5,201,793 owned by the
assignee of this application.These known devices usually provide for
rotation of the air nozzles or air jets in the same or
opposite direction to the direction of rotation of the
needle cylinder of the circular knitting machine.
While generally effective for removing fiber waste from
the knitting instrumentalities, such cleaning devices
provide for rotation of the air nozzles or air jets by
incorporating the driving means therefor into the
driving mechanism of the circular knitting machine at
the time of manufacture of the knitting machine or by a
major modification of the circular knitting machine.
Once installed, such cleaning devices are very
difficult to service and/or repair where such service
or repair requires demounting and remounting the same.
Also, the inclusion of such prior cleaning devices is
very difficult, time consuming and expensive.With the foregoing in mind, it is an object
of this invention to provide apparatus for removing
fiber waste which may be easily installed on either new
or existing machines and which obviates the
disadvantages and deficiencies of prior cleaning
devices. This object is achieved by an apparatus for removing fiber waste from knitting
instrumentalities of a circular knitting machine, comprising an air jet for blowing a high
velocity stream of air onto the knitting instrumentalities of a circular knitting machine
to blow fiber waste therefrom,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (20) for removing fiber waste from knitting instrumentalities of a
circular knitting machine (10) said apparatus (20) being capable of being easily

installed on new or existing circular knitting machines (10) with only minor
modification, if any, being required of the circular knitting machine (10), said

apparatus comprising:

an air jet (42) for blowing a high velocity stream of air onto the knitting
instrumentalities of a circular knitting machine (10) to blow fiber waste therefrom,
means (21-25, 40, 41) mounting said air jet (42) for rotation above and relative
to the knitting instrumentalities,
drive means (26, 30-36) for rotating said air jet (42), and
means (43-48) for connecting said air jet (42) to a source of compressed air
while accomodating rotation of said air jet (42) relative to the knitting

instrumentalities,

said apparatus (20) 
being characterized in that
 said drive means (26, 30-36) for
rotating said air jet (42) are independent of the drive means of the circular knitting

machine (10).
Apparatus (20) according to claim 1 wherein said drive means (26, 30-36)
rotates said air jet (42) first in one direction for a predetermined distance or time

interval and then reverses the direction of rotation for a predetermined distance or
time interval.
Apparatus (20) according to claim 1 wherein said drive means (26, 30-36)
comprises a reversible motor (32) connected to said air jet mounting means (21-25,

40, 41) for rotating said air jet (42), a reversing switch (33) connected to said motor
(32) for reversing said motor (32) each time said switch (33) is actuated, and

actuating means (34-36) carried by said air jet mounting means (21-25, 40, 41) for 
actuating said switch (33) upon rotation of said air jet (42) for a predetermined

distance in either direction.
Apparatus (20) according to claim 1 wherein said air jet mounting means (21-25,
40, 41) comprises a carrier ring member (25) mounted for coaxial rotation above

the rotary cylinder (14) of the circular knitting machine (10) and having said air jet
(42) carried thereby and depending outwardly and downwardly therefrom.
Apparatus (20) according to claim 4 wherein said means (43-48) for
connecting said air jet (42) to a source of compressed air comprises an air supply

pipe (46) connected at one end to and movable with said air jet (42) and connected at
its other end to a compressed air source, and intermediate its ends being arranged in

coils or convolutions which unwind and rewind upon rotation of said air jet (42) in
opposite directions.
Apparatus (20) according to claim 5 wherein said air supply pipe (46) has its
intermediate portion arranged in spiral coils or convolutions.
Apparatus (20) according to claim 5 wherein said air supply pipe (46) has its
intermediate portion arranged in helical coils or convolutions.
Apparatus (50) according to claim 4 wherein one end portion of an air supply
pipe (65) winds about the periphery of said carrier ring member (51) upon rotation in

one direction and unwinds therefrom upon rotation in the other direction, and wherein
the other end portion is wound about a storage reel (67) from which it unwinds and

rewinds upon rotation of said carrier ring member (51).
Apparatus (50) according to claim 8 wherein said storage reel (67) includes
coil spring means (76) which is tightened by unwinding of said air supply pipe (65)

from said reel (67) and rewinds said air supply pipe (65) onto said reel (67) when the
direction of rotation reverses.
