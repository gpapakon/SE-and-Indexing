<ABSTRACT>
In a debit card (10) having international standardisation of the outer dimensions and of the position of the contact surface of an implanted semiconductor chip, the semiconductor chip being arranged on a plug-in part (14) which is essentially smaller in its dimensions with respect to the debit card, which plug-in part (14) is mounted exchangeably in a clamped position in a recess (13) arranged in the debit card (10), the recess (13) in the debit card (10) being arranged in such a manner that the debit card (10) with the plug-in part (14) locked therein remains usable for further debit card applications and, if necessary, the plug-in part (14) itself can be used as an independent minichip-card in essentially smaller terminal devices, to improve the clamping position of the plug-in part in the debit card it is provided that, for compensation of tolerances, at least one limiting edge of the recess (13) arranged in the debit card (10) is provided with a resilient clamping configuration (33) for accommodating the plug-in part (14).

<CLAIMS>
Authorisation card (10) with international
standardisation of the external dimensions and the

position of the contact surface of an implanted
semiconductor chip, wherein the semiconductor chip is

disposed on a push-in part (14) of substantially
smaller dimensions than the authorisation card, which

push-in part (14) is held in a recess (13), which is
disposed in the authorisation card (10), with a clamp

fit and such that it can be interchanged, wherein the
recess (13) is disposed in the authorisation card (10)

such that the authorisation card (10) with the push-in
part (14) engaged therein remains usable for other

card applications and the actual push-in part (14) may
optionally be inserted as an independent mini-chip

card in substantially smaller terminal devices,

characterised in that at least one boundary edge of
the recess (13) disposed in the authorisation card

(10) to accommodate the push-in part (14) is provided
with a resilient clamping formation (33) for tolerance

compensation.
Authorisation card according to claim 1, characterised
in that two boundary edges of the recess (13) are

provided with a resilient clamping formation (33).
Authorisation card according to claim 2, characterised
in that all the boundary edges of the recess (13)

comprise a resilient clamping formation (33).
Authorisation card according to claim 2, characterised
in that one of two mutually opposite boundary edges of

the recess (13) in each case comprises a resilient
clamping formation (33).
Authorisation card according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the boundary edges of the recess

(13) are formed so as to extend in undulatory fashion 
with a sequence of elevations (30) and depressions

(31), and that a hole (32) in the authorisation card
(10) is associated with each elevation (30) and

disposed at a perpendicular spacing therefrom so as to
form a resilient web (33).
Authorisation card according to claim 5, characterised
in that the webs (33) are approximately two to five

tenths of a millimetre wide.
Authorisation card according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the recess (13) in the

authorisation card (10) is closed on one side by means
of a cover (20).
Authorisation card according to claim 7, characterised
in that the cover (20) consists of a film which

overlays the authorisation card on the associated
side.
Authorisation card according to claim 7, characterised
in that the recess (13) in the authorisation
 card (10)
is milled out while leaving a bottom surface acting as

a cover (20) for the recess (13).
Authorisation card according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the authorisation card (10)

comprises two recesses (13), which are aligned
relative to the mutually opposite slide-in edges (12),

to accommodate two push-in parts (14).
