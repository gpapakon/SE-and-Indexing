<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot comprising a shell (1) and an upper (3) hinged on to the shell. This upper consists of a first part (5) forming a stirrup (6) which extends around and above the heel, and a second part (7) which surrounds at least the back of the leg. These two parts can be made integral in rotation by connection means consisting of a catch (ratchet mechanism) (9) hinged on to the second part so that it can be supported by the stirrup (6). In certain embodiments, the catch also allows the upper to be locked on to the shell in the downhill position.

<CLAIMS>
A ski boot comprising a shell (1) intended to 
surround the foot and the heel and a shaft (3; 3') 

articulated on the shell and consisting of two parts, 
namely a first part (5; 15; 25) forming a stirrup (6; 16; 

19) extending around and above the heel and a second part 
(7; 18) surrounding at least the rear of the leg, these two 

parts being able to be fixed to each other with respect to 
rotation by connecting means, at least in the closed 

position of the shaft, characterized in that the said connecting 
means consist of a catch (9; 14; 17; 22) articulated on 

the rear of the second part of the shaft so as to be able 
to bear on the stirrup. 
The ski boot as claimed in claim 1, the shaft of 
which is equipped, at the rear, with means of locking in 

the downhill position, these means comprising firstly a 
stop (12) formed on the shell and secondly a catch 

articulated on the second part of the shaft, characterized 
in that the catch for locking the shaft on the shell is the 

same as the catch (14; 17; 22) fixing the two parts of the 
shaft together. 
The ski boot as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the stirrup (16) lies above the stop (12) on the shell 

and the catch (17) has two beaks (17a, 17b) situated at different 
distances from the axis of the catch, one (17a) of these 

beaks bearing against the upper edge of the stirrup and the 
other beak (17b) bearing against the stop (12) on the shell 

so that, when the catch pivots away from its locked 
position, the catch first of all moves away from the stop 

on the shell, and then from the stirrup. 
The ski boot as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the end (14a; 22a) of the catch (14; 22) has a thickness 

such that in the locked position it bears both against the stop 
(12) on the shell and against the upper edge of the stirrup 

(6; 19), so that when pivoting away from its locked 
position it first moves away from the stop on the shell and 

then from the upper edge of the stirrup.
