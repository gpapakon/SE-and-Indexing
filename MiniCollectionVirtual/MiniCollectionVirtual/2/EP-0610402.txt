<ABSTRACT>
A composite stiffness layer (11) is provided in segments (11A, 11B, 11C) and the orientation of the reinforcing fibers in adjacent segments is dissimilar (17). A damping layer (15) may be integral with a stiffness layer, adhered to a stiffness layer, or sandwiched between stiffness layers. Multiple layer composite structures may be formed as tubes, plates, beams or other forms with improved damping proportions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite
structures. It is particularly directed to multiple
layer composite structures, and provides a multi segment
construction with significantly improved damping
properties.The control of vibrations
in composite structures is an important area of research
in aerospace, automotive and other industries. For
example, spacecraft vibrations initiated by attitude
adjusting thrusters, motors and thermally induced
stresses inhibit accurate aiming of antennas and other
equipment carried by the craft. Such vibrations can
cause severe damage to the craft and its associated
equipment. Fatigue failure of structural components can
occur at stresses well below static load limits.Composite materials have been used to construct
a wide variety of structural elements, including tubes,
enclosures, beams, plates and irregular shapes. Objects
as diverse as rocket motor housings and sporting goods,
notably skis, archery arrows, vaulting poles and tennis
rackets have been structured from composite materials.
While composite constructions have offered many
significant advantages, such as excellent strength and
stiffness properties, together with light weight, the
poor vibration damping properties of such constructions
have been of concern. The article "Understanding
Vibration Measurements," George F. Lang, Sound and
Vibration, March, 1976, p. 26, presents a generally
accepted mathematical treatment of the vibration of
mechanical structures under environmental loading. This
treatment applies generally to composite structures, and
is incorporated by reference for purposes of this
disclosure for its explanation of the amplification
factor Q and its relationship to the viscous damping 
factor Î¾. The "loss ratio" referred to in this
disclosure is twice the viscous damping factor as defined
by Lang.A technique known as "constrained layer
damping" has been relied upon to add damping properties
to existing structures. According to this technique,
damping material, typically a viscoelastic material, is
applied to the surface of a composite structure, such as
an airplane wing. The damping material is sandwiched
between the composite surface and a rigid layer, such as
a thin aluminum sheet. This approach has generally been
remedial in character and is accomplished at the
sacrifice of other considerations, such as weight,
aesthetics and ideal surface configuration. It is known
that laminated beams composed of alternating layers of
elastic and viscoelastic materials can dissipate
vibratory energy while
