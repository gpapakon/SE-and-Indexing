<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Known measurement methods and measuring arrangements have the disadvantage that the measurement of the phase change in the interference signals which is necessary for determining the measured distance is performed with a resolution of at most approximately 1/10 of the total wavelength. However, this resolution comes nowhere near the resolution which can be achieved using other methods. Moreover, because of the ignorance of the wavelength no relative measurements can be carried out following an absolute measurement. 2.2 This disadvantage is overcome in the measurement method according to the invention owing to the fact that at the ends of each measurement cycle the air wavelength of the laser beam is controlled to a specific wavelength value by means of an additionally provided control interferometer having a control section which is shorter than the measurement section and thereafter the air wavelength is continuously tuned within a specific wavelength interval and controlled to the final value by means of the control interferometer. The phase change in the interference signal is continuously detected during the wavelength modulation. A simple mathematical relationship can be used to determine the measurement section from the measured wavelengths and the phase shift. Relating the measurement uncertainty of this method to that of the conventional interferometers can be achieved by using a further laser having at least one further discrete wavelength by generating a beat wavelength, which must be greater than the measurement uncertainty owing to the continuous tuning of the wavelength. It is possible, furthermore, to use this method to carry out relative measurements following an absolute measurement. 2.3. The measurement method and the laser interferometer arrangement are suitable, in particular, for absolute distance measurements.
