<ABSTRACT>
A method of imparting improved conditioning 
properties to hair comprising treating the hair with a 

clear conditioning composition comprising an amidoamine 
salt, said amidoamine salt comprising an amidoamine 

compound having the general structural formula: 

neutralized with a suitable acid, wherein R₁ is a fatty 
acid chain having about 11 to about 21 carbon atoms, R₂ 

is an alkylene group having two to about four carbon 
atoms, R₃ is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or a 

hydroxyalkylene group having one to about three carbon 
atoms, R₄ is methyl, ethyl or a hydroxyalkylene group 

having one to about three carbon atoms, and Y is a 
heterocyclic nitrogen-containing moiety, like 

morpholine or pyridine; and a silicone compound having 
at least one quaternary ammonium moiety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clear
conditioning composition and to a method of treating
hair that imparts improved conditioning properties to
hair. The resulting clear,
conditioning composition can be applied to the hair
from an aqueous solution or spray, a conditioner
formulation, a hair color or other similar hair
treatment product, over a pH range of 4 to
7, to improve both the wet stage and the dry stage
properties of the hair.Most individuals buy and use a hair shampoo for
its cleansing properties. In addition to having clean
hair, a consumer also desires sufficiently-conditioned
hair that holds a preset configuration. However, hair
shampoos generally are formulated with highly effective
anionic surfactants that primarily clean as opposed to
conditioning in the hair. Anionic surfactants not only
remove the dirt and soil from the hair, but also remove
sebum naturally present on the surface of the hair
fibers. Therefore, the desirable cleansing properties
of anionic surfactants also leave the hair in a
cosmetically-unsatisfactory condition. Shampoos also
do not detangle wet hair and do not impart residual
conditioning benefits to dry hair, such as
manageability or styleability of hair sets.In general, shampoo compositions containing
anionic surfactants, or nonionic surfactants or
amphoteric surfactants, leave hair with an undesirable
harsh, dull and dry touch, or feel, usually called 
"creak", after the hair is shampooed and then rinsed
with water. Furthermore, thoroughly cleansed hair also
is extremely difficult to comb, in either the wet or
the dry state, because the individual hair fibers tend
to snarl, kink, and interlock with each other. In
addition, incompletely dried hair, such as hair dried
with a towel, has poor brushing properties, and after
complete drying, the hair does not set well. The
combing or brushing property of dry hair remains poor,
and the hair has undesirable electrostatic properties
in a low humidity atmosphere that causes the hair to
"fly away", thereby further reducing the brushing
properties of the hair.The unsatisfactory combing or brushing property of
hair immediately after shampooing, or during trimming
treatments after shampooing, also causes hair damage,
such as split ends or hair breakage. In addition, the
natural luster and resiliency of the hair is reduced.
The overall unsatisfactory condition of shampooed hair
often necessitates a subsequent post-shampoo treatment
of the hair with a conditioning composition to improve
these undesirable physical
