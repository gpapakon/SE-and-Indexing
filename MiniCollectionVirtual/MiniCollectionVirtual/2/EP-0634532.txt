<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a sealing arrangement (10) on a structural member (11), in particular shaped concrete part, having at least one compensation body (21) which contains at least one inner cavity (22) with a filling (24) consisting of a non-compressible material. The filling (24) can be moved in all directions by a slight exterior pressure, sets increasingly with a greater exterior pressure, and forms a rigid, non-deformable core under high pressure. The compensation body (21) is worked into the material of the structural member (11), in particular concreted therein, when said member is shaped.

concrete, fibre concrete or similar, e.g. a road or yard

wall or outside wall element, pipe, advancing pipe, fuel
trap or similar, with at least one equalising member -

active as sealing member, if required - which contains at
least one inner cavity with a filling made of non-compressible

material and which is already cemented into
the material of the structural member as a ring part during

forming of the structural member, characterised in that a
compression seal (30; 230) integral to the at least one

equalising member (21; 221) in the form of a sealing ring
adjoins it at least on one side as an extension, said

compression seal being cemented into the structural member

structural member (211).
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(221) is worked into the region of a face (246) of the
structural member (211) running inwards in horizontal

direction and/or a face (247) thereof running outwards.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) is worked in on the lower end of the structural
member (11; 211), in particular in the bell-shaped portion

or bushing of a tubbing ring.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) has at least one anchoring part (18; 218) which
is worked in, in particular cemented in, during working

into the material of the structural member (11; 211).
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that on its outside (17; 217), which is

not worked in, the at least one equalising member (21; 221)
has at least one deformable sealing lip (26; 226) which is

integral with the equalising member (21; 221).
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) is constructed in the manner of a flexible tube. 
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) is formed from a closed ring part (41; 241) and
forms ring faces with its outside.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) is formed from individual elements preferably
placed at equal distances from one another, viewed in

circumferential direction, e.g. is formed from at least
three symmetrically placed individual elements.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) has walls made of deformable material, e.g.
rubber or plastic.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the at least one equalising member

(21; 221) is dimensioned to have a diameter at least
slightly smaller than a shaping ring part (140) and before

working into the structural member (11; 211) is held on the
ring part (140) with pre-stressing and simultaneous

sealing.
Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that the compression seal (30; 230)

extends in the region of the inner face (48; 248), e.g.

Sealing arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the compression seal (30; 230)

particular a concrete part, which at least supports the
