<ABSTRACT>
A hydropneumatic positioning device comprises a tubular 
container (10). A hollow piston rod (18) is guided through one 

end of the tubular container (10). A piston (22) is connected with the 
piston rod (18) within a cavity (12) of the tubular container. The 

piston (22) divides the cavity (12) into two working chambers (12A,12B). The 
working chambers (12A,12B) contain a liquid. Adjacent one of the working 

chambers (12B), namely the working chamber remote from the 
piston rod (18), a compensating chamber (26) is provided. This compensating 

chamber (26) contains a pressurized gas and is separated 
from the adjacent working chamber by a floating separating 

wall (28). A flow passage (24A to 24E) extends through the piston (22) between 
the two working chambers (12A,12B). A valve (30) is allocated to the flow 

passage (24A to 24E). The valve (30) can be opened by an actuating rod 
(32) extending through an axial bore (34) of the hollow piston rod (18). The 

actuating rod (32) extends beyond an outer end of the piston rod (18). An 
actuating signal transformer (11) is fastened to the outer end of 

the piston rod (18). The signal transformer (11) is constructed as a 
hydraulic press with a liquid chamber (44) or as an electromagnetic 

coil (168A) with an armature (168B), an input piston (56), and 
an output piston (48). The output piston (48) acts onto the outer end (36) 

of the actuating rod (32) and the input piston (56) can be actuated 
manually.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a method for supplementing a positioning device for
hydraulic or electric actuation in response to respective requirements of
various cases of application, said positioning device comprising as basic
components a housing unit having an axis, a piston rod axially extending
inwards and outwards of said housing unit, a piston unit connected to said
piston rod within said housing unit, said piston rod and said piston unit
forming a piston-piston rod unit, said piston unit separating two working
chambers from each other within said housing unit, said working chambers
containing a fluid, said working chambers being interconnected by a fluid
passage, said fluid passage being selectively closable and openable by
valve means allocated to said fluid passage, said valve means being
actuable by actuating rod means guided through an axial actuating rod
guiding bore allocated to a respective one of said housing unit and said
piston-piston rod unit.Positioning devices such as blockable gas springs and hydropneumatic
springs are widely used, e.g. for height adjustment of tables and chairs. For
blocking and unblocking such positioning devices a valve is provided
between two fluid-filled working chambers of the positioning device. The
valve is frequently operated through a rod or pin extending beyond a piston
rod or a housing of the positioning device. The requirements as to the
actuation of this actuating rod are different depending on the various
constructions of which the positioning device forms a part. Sometimes a
remote actuation is desired, sometimes a direct actuation of the piston rod
is possible, sometimes a long actuation path is acceptable and a low
actuation force is required. In other situations a high actuation force is
available and a short actuation path is required.From German patent 1 554 478 a gas spring is known with a cylinder and
a piston rod extending inwards and outwards of the cylinder. A piston is 
connected with the piston rod within the cylinder. The piston separates the
cavity within the cylinder into two working chambers which are both filled
with a pressurized gas. A flow passage is provided for selectively
connecting and separating the two working chambers from each other. This
flow passage extends across the piston. A valve member is provided within
an axial bore of the piston rod. For selectively opening and closing the flow
passage an actuating piston is provided adjacent the outer end of the piston
red within the bore thereof. A liquid filling is provided
