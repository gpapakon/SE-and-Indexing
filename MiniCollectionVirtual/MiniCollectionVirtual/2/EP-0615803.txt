<ABSTRACT>
A deformed ultra fine grain is comprised of a 
spherical body and a tail-like projection projecting 

from the surface of the spherical body. The tail-like 
projection exhibits a separating effect on the adjacent 

deformed ultra fine grains and therefore, aggregation of 
the ultra fine grains is avoided. Bulk quantities of 

the deformed ultra fine grains are produced by 
evaporating a metal by a plasma are in a controlled 

atmosphere having a gas that combines with the material 
of the spherical body to form the tail-like projection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to deformed ultra 
fine grains and processes for producing same in bulk. There are various conventionally known types of 
ultra fine grains (for example, see Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-open Nos. 38505/90 and 294417/90). However, all of the prior art ultra fine grains are 
spherical in shape and hence, they are liable to become 
aggregated and, if the ultra fine grains are used, for 
example, as a catalyst element for conversion of an 
exhaust gas from an automobile engine, a sufficient 
catalytic activity cannot be obtained. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a deformed ultra fine grain which 
is formed into a non-spherical shape and avoids 
aggregation. To achieve the above object, according to the 
present invention, there is provided a deformed ultra 
fine grain comprising a spherical body, and a tail-like 
projection extending from the surface of the spherical 
body.  With the above configuration, the tail-like 
projection exhibits a separating effect on the adjacent 
deformed ultra fine grains, thereby avoiding aggregation 
of the deformed ultra fine grains. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a producing process which can easily provide for 
producing bulk quantities of deformed ultra fine grains 
of the type described above. To achieve the above objects, according to the 
present invention, there is provided a process for 
producing a bulk of deformed ultra fine grains each 
comprised of a spherical body of metal and a tail-like 
projection of ceramic projecting from a surface of the 
spherical body, comprising the steps of: melting a 
metal blank by plasma arc in a controlled atmosphere 
including a gas contributing to the formation of the 
ceramic, thereby forming a large number of spherical 
metal droplets by the clustering of evaporated 
particles; and precipitating and growing the ceramic by 
a reaction of the metal element with the gas on the 
surfaces of the spherical metal droplets. With the above process, the mass production in bulk 
quantities of deformed ultra fine grains each comprised 
of the spherical body of the metal and the tail-like 
projection of the ceramic can be easily produced at a 
single melting step. The above and other objects, features and 
advantages of the invention will become apparent from  
 
the following description of preferred embodiments, 
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a deformed ultra 
fine grain; Fig. 2A to 2E are
