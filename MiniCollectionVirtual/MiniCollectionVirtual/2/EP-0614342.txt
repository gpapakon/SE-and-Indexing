<ABSTRACT>
A closure prosthesis and transcatheter delivery system are disclosed, wherein the closure prosthesis seals across an opening of a fluid passageway within a living body. The closure prosthesis is a flexible disk (10) including a flexible ring (12) and diaphragm (14) having a plurality of hollow flexible wire segments (18) attached thereto. Delivery of the closure prosthesis is accomplished using a hollow sheath (26) and a pusher catheter (28) slidable within the sheath, wherein filaments are looped through the wire segments to releasably connect the disk to the pusher catheter. The disk is resiliently compressed within the sheath and, upon release therefrom, the disk resiliently expands into a larger, unrestrained shape. Tension applied to the filaments resiliently bends the wire segments so that they may be drawn through the opening of the defect. Upon releasing the filaments from the disk, the wire segements resiliently expand to trap the disk in place to seal across the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to closure prostheses
which might find application for transcatheter placement
within the heart to close congenital and operative
cardiovascular defects.Examples of such cardiovascular defects include those
which result in an abnormal opening in the cardiovascular
system and permit deleterious shunting of blood thereacross,
such as atrial and ventricle septum defects and patent ductus
arteriosus. To minimize the risk of mortality associated
with surgery, transcatheter techniques have been developed to
introduce closure devices for sealing such defects. One
example of such a device is described in Blake, U.S. Patent
No. 4,007,743. Blake discloses a pair of umbrella-like
closure devices which include resilient ring sections to
automatically open the struts of the umbrella as the devices
are pushed out of their respective catheters. King et al.,
U.S. Patent No. 3,874,388 upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based,
similarly discloses a pair of
umbrella-like closure devices which interconnect after
placement to seal across a defect.These and other such devices rely on the caudal and
cranial ends of the device being larger than the opening of
the defect itself to physically trap the device across the
opening. To accommodate transcatheter delivery techniques,
the resulting device configurations have become unduly
mechanical in nature, often including multiple components or
requiring sequential delivery. Also, many of these devices
require assembly across the defect after delivery, thereby 
increasing the complexity of the transcatheter equipment and
delivery process.A need therefore exists for an improved closure device.
Such a device would be of a compact, unitary construction,
therefore permitting the device to be delivered intact using
transcatheter techniques. Also, such a device would be
delivered from a sheath or catheter in a one-step procedure,
rather than requiring sequential delivery. Similarly, such a
device would be manually controlled after delivery to ensure
proper placement and sealing across the defect. Preferably,
the device would also be self-centering to facilitate proper
delivery and placement across the defect. The invention provides a flexible closure prosthesis and
transcatheter delivery system for sealing an opening with
a diameter in a fluid passageway within a living body,
comprising:
a hollow sheath sized to fit through the opening and
having a proximal end; a pusher catheter slidable within said sheath;at least one filament slidably connected to
