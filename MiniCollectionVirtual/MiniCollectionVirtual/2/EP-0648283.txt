<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a component made of an intermetallic compound of titanium and aluminium or alloys of such intermetallic compounds with alloying components as a raw material and with diffused aluminium coating of the raw material. The component has, between the raw material and the diffused aluminium coating, a closed region close to the surface with a recrystallisation structure. To that end the component is cold-formed or melted in a region close to the surface and then annealed at recrystallisation temperature, after which a diffused aluminium coating is applied to the recrystallised region. The invention is used for components of motive power units, especially those in the hot gas line.

A component comprising an intermetallic compound of 
titanium and aluminium or alloys of such intermetallic 

compounds with alloying additives as a base material and 
with aluminium diffusion coating of the base material, 

characterised in that the component has a closed zone with 
a recrystallisation structure near the surface between the 

base material and the diffused aluminium coating. 
A component according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the intermetallic compound is TiAl. 
A component according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the intermetallic compound is an alloy of 50 to 95 vol.% 

TiAl and 5 to 50 vol.% Ti
3
Al. 
A component according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the intermetallic compound contains 

up to 4 atom % alloying additives. 
A component according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the alloying additives comprise 

niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten or vanadium or 
mixtures of the same. 
A component according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the depth of the zone is at least 0.1 Âµm. 
A method of manufacturing a component according to any 
one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a zone near the 

surface of the component is cold-formed or melted and 
subsequently annealed at recrystallisation temperature and,  

 
finally, a diffused aluminium coating is applied to the 

recrystallised zone. 
A method according to claim 7, characterised in that 
superficial cold-forming is carried out by shot-peening or 

mechanical processing of the surface regions of the 
component to be recrystallised. 
A method according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that 
recrystallisation and aluminium diffusion coating are carried 

out by means of a heat cycle, the superficially cold-formed 
component first being heated to the recrystallisation 

temperature in an aluminium diffusion coating installation 
and, after recrystallisation has taken place, the temperature 

being regulated for aluminium diffusion coating and 
aluminium-containing donor gas simultaneously being 

supplied. 
A method according to any one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterised in that the heat cycle takes place using 

protective gas or under reduced pressure until the 
aluminium-containing donor gas is supplied. 
A method according to any one of claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that aluminium diffusion coating is carried 

out by means of a powder packing method and, to 
generate a donor gas, an aluminium donor of the ternary 

alloy Ti/Al/C is used.
