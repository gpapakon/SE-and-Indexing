<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to smoking articles and 
has as an objective the provision of improved smoking 
articles. The subject invention provides smoking article filter 
rod comprising as filtration material moisture 
disintegrative paper. Should the filter rod comprise 
wrapper means, then preferably the wrapper means is 
readily degradable. The subject invention further provides a smoking 
article comprising a smoking material rod and a filter, 
said filter comprising as filtration material moisture 
disintegrative paper. Preferably, any other components of 
the filter are readily degradable. It is also preferable 
that the smoking material rod is readily degradable and 
that the means interattaching the smoking material rod and 
the filter is readily degradable. Filter rod according to the subject invention can be 
made using a filter rod making machine conventional for 
the making of paper filters, a Decouflé such machine for 
example. The moisture disintegrative paper must be strong 
enough for web feed to the rod maker without an undue 
incidence of paper breakage. According to a proposed test for paper 
disintegration, a sample piece of the paper of an area of 
500 cm² is placed in 250ml of water in a one litre  
 
laboratory measuring cylinder. The mouth of the cylinder 
is sealed, following which the paper sample is subjected 
to mechanical agitation by virtue of the fact that the 
cylinder is inverted and then restored to its initial 
orientation. The paper sample is then observed. This 
invertion/restoration operation is repeated until it is 
observed that the paper sample has disintegrated to such 
an extent that all of the remaining pieces of paper are of 
an area of 1 cm² or less. The number of 
invertion/restoration operations that have been necessary 
to bring about this result is recorded as being a moisture 
disintegration index. For use as moisture disintegrative filtration 
material for the purposes of the subject invention paper 
should be of a moisture disintegration index value, as 
determined by the just detailed test method, not exceeding 
about 20. Preferably, the index should not exceed about 15 
and more preferably the index should not exceed about 10. 
More preferably still, the index should not exceed about 
7, or even about 5. It has been determined, by use of the above detailed 
test method, that a typical moisture disintegration index 
value for a conventional paper for use as filtration 
material in a smoking article filter is in a range not 
lower than about 25 to
