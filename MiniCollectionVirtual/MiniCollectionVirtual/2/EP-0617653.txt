<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cup control apparatus (10) for applying and releasing vacuum in a vacuum cup (12) includes a venturi passage (16) for inducing a vacuum within the vacuum cup (12) upon the flow of pressurized air therethrough. Another air flow passage (44) extends through the housing (14) for injecting a flow of air under pressure to the vacuum cup (12) to relieve the vacuum therein. A sensor (90) senses the vacuum level attained in the vacuum cup (12). A feedback signal is sent by the control apparatus (10) to the external controller (80) as an indication that a predetermined, selectible vacuum level has been achieved. The control apparatus (10) is responsive to the sensor (90) and signals from an external controller (80) for applying vacuum to the vacuum cup (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
vacuum cups and, more specifically, to a vacuum control apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1 for applying and releasing a 
vacuum from a vacuum cup. Vacuum cups are commonly employed as workpiece 
gripping elements to engage and transport a workpiece in 
a manufacturing operation, to load and unload sheet metal 
parts into and from a die, or to carry a part, such as an 
automobile windshield, to the vehicle to which it is to 
be installed. Such vacuum cups employ a control apparatus 
which uses a venturi passage in a body which is connected 
to a source of air under pressure. Air flow through the 
venturi passage induces a subatmospheric pressure in the 
throat of the venturi and in a passage connecting the 
venturi throat to the interior of the vacuum cup which 
will induce a vacuum within the cup when the cup engages 
a workpiece surface. In earlier versions of such vacuum 
cup control apparatus, it was necessary to constantly 
maintain the flow of air through the venturi passage in 
order to maintain the vacuum in the cup because the air 
withdrawn from the cup flowed into the venturi passage 
and to the discharge vent at the end of this passage. 
Upon cessation of the air flow, air at atmospheric 
pressure was free to flow in a reverse direction through 
the discharge vent, the venturi passage and into the 
vacuum cup to dissipate the vacuum therein. Efforts to address this problem led to the use 
of one-way check valves between the venturi and the 
vacuum cup to seal the vacuum in the vacuum cup upon  
 
cessation of air flow through the venturi. This enabled 
the vacuum cup to securely maintain a grip on a workpiece 
after air flow through the venturi was stopped. Another problem with previously devised vacuum 
cups deals with the quick release of the vacuum from the 
cup to release the workpiece at the conclusion of the 
handling operation. The passage from the discharge vent 
to the vacuum cup is a relatively restricted passage and 
the rate of air flow through this passage would diminish 
substantially as the pressure differential between the 
negative pressure within the cup and atmospheric pressure 
approached equalization. Further, even when the vacuum 
was turned "off", the suction remaining between the 
vacuum cup and the workpiece could be sufficient to cause 
the vacuum cup to remain attached to the workpiece and 
thereby prevent or make uncertain the release of the 
workpiece from the vacuum cup. Efforts to overcome this problem
