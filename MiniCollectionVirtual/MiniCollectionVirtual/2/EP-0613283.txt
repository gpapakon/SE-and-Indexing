<ABSTRACT>
An image input apparatus includes an illumination unit to produce a 
quantity of light to illuminate a transmitting original and a support unit 

operable to allow the quantity of light to be scanned and to support and 
move the transmitting original. Additionally, the image input apparatus 

includes a reading unit to read light which is received by or passed through 
the transmitting original.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image input apparatuses used to
process images formed on films and the like through use of transmitted
illumination.Image input apparatuses are well known. In fact, many image input
apparatuses are configured in a manner to include illumination units to
illuminate and to guide illuminating light towards a "transmitting original."
Moreover, such image input apparatuses often include scanning units
comprising carriages which provide support structures to support the
transmitting original during processing. Additionally, projection units are
often used as reading units for imaging transmitted light on a line sensor
(e.g., a charged coupled device or "CCD").Typically, the light illuminated from an illumination unit is condensed
into a linear form on the transmitting original, and after transmission through
the original, is imaged on a CCD. The transmitted light is read a line at a
time to produce a sequence of data (e.g., digital data related to the
transmitting original). After a line has been read, a scanning unit performs a
movement of a line, thereby changing the position of the transmitting 
original, and reading is again performed. By repeating this kind of reading
and movement over a series of times, the scanning of an image surface is
successfully performed.A typical image input apparatus which contains the structure and
performs as described above, is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication 3-145881 (JP-A-3-145881). In JP-A-3-145881, there is
proposed a well-known optical reading unit. More particularly, the optical
reading unit comprises a support body with a film insertion aperture formed
on the surface of the support body for the insertion of a film. The film acts
as a transmitting original. The optical reading unit also includes a conveyor
device for freely conveying the film from the film insertion aperture in a
direction towards the interior of the optical reading unit. Movement is
carried out in a reciprocating manner. Additionally, at least one portion of
the optical reading unit has an optical axis which is transverse to the
conveying direction of the conveyor device.In terms of the problems associated with typical image reading
apparatuses and optical reading apparatuses, such apparatuses typically
require a carriage to support and move a film disposed on a conveyor means
which moves along a fixed shaft. As such, a focus adjustment in the optical
axis direction of the light which the film transmitted or reflected is
impossible. Accordingly,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image input apparatus comprising:

an illumination unit (27) to emit a quantity of
light to illuminate a transmitting original, the

transmitting original allowing light to pass
therethrough;
a reading unit (33) to read light reflected
from or passed through the transmitting original;
a holder (15, 16) holding the original;
an imaging optical system (31, 32) to image the
light passed through the original;
a guide mechanism to guide the holder to move the
original in a plane approximately parallel to the

surface of the original;
a driver unit (11) to drive the holder across the
guide mechanism; and
a regulation unit (8, 23) to regulate an imaging
state of the imaging optical system, characterised in

that the guide mechanism includes a pair of linear
guide members (17), wherein the pair of linear guide

members are formed below the holder and support the
holder, and in that the regulation unit performs said

regulation by moving the guide mechanism including the
pair of linear guide members, in a direction

approximately perpendicular to the surface of the 
original, the regulation unit including an eccentric

shaft (23), wherein respective first ends of the pair
of linear guide members connect to the eccentric

shaft.
An image apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further
comprising:


a toothed rack (16a) connected to said holder;
a rotationally driven pinion gear (14a), said
pinion gear engaging said rack to move
 the holder in
a first direction perpendicular to an optical axis of

the light; and
a second regulation unit (16b) to regulate the
movement of said rack, to limit the movement of the

rack in a second direction
parallel to the optical axis of the light

as the light illuminates the transmitting original,
and to guide the movement in the first direction.
The image input apparatus according to claim 2,
wherein said apparatus further comprises a fixing unit

to positionally fix said illumination unit and to
positionally fix said reading unit.
An image input apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
further comprising: 


a compression unit (18) to elastically sandwich
and compress a first side and a second side of the

transmitting original in said holder so that the
original is approximately centrally supported in said

holder and in the direction of an optical axis of the
light as the light illuminates the transmitting

original.
