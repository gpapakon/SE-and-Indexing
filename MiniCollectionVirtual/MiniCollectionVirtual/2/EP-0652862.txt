<ABSTRACT>
A process for the alkali hydrolysis of an amido ester to the corresponding amido acid is disclosed. The process is characterized by the steps of: A) hydrolyzing, in an aqueous alkaline media, an amido ester represented by formula (I), wherein R is selected from C1-20 alkyl, R1 is selected from C2-14 alkylene and C2-14 alkenylene, and R2 is selected from hydrogen and alkyl, aryl and aralkyl groups containing 1-10 carbon atoms, and R3 is selected from C1-8 alkyl; with at least one equivalent of an alkali metal salt per mole of amido ester at 20-160  C to produce an amido acid salt; and B) acidifying the amido acid salt with at least 1.0 equivalents of a strong acid, per mole of amido acid salt at, 20-160  C to produce an amido acid. The process gives a high yield and a good selectivity for the amido acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of amido acids 
by hydrolysis of amido esters and to a process for drying such amido 
acids. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of amido acids of the formula III from amido alkyl esters: 
 
wherein R is selected from C1-20 alkyl; R1 is selected from C2-14 
alkylene and C2-14 alkenylene; and R2 is selected from hydrogen and 
alkyl, aryl and aralkyl groups containing 1-10 carbon atoms. Such amido acids and a method for their preparation are known from 
European patent application 0 445 096. In the process of this patent 
application, these amido acids are prepared by the hydrolysis of the 
amido monoalkyl ester under conditions which avoid transition metal 
contamination of the amido acids. The hydrolysis process is described 
as being conventional. While the patent application does not give 
further details, one can conclude that by conventional is meant an 
acid hydrolysis process since acid hydrolysis is the industrially 
preferred method to produce pure acids and in this application an 
analogous process, namely hydrolysis of diamide by-products of the 
reaction to produce the monoalkyl ester, is carried out with an 
inorganic acid. Hydrolysis under alkaline conditions is nowhere 
suggested. Production of the amido acids by acid hydrolysis resulted in a low 
selectivity for the amido acid and, therefore, substantial quantities 
of undesirable by-products. The formation of these by-products not 
only reduced the yield of the desired amido acid, but also gave  
 
problems in the purification of the amido acid. It was found that this 
problem could be reduced by continuously removing alkanol from the 
reactor during the hydrolysis reaction, but such alkanol removal 
proved to be impractical for large-scale production. In addition, problems were encountered when drying the amido peracids, 
particularly when scaling-up the production process. A drying process 
such as that disclosed in DE 35 39 036, i.e. vacuum drying at 30°C is 
unsuitable for large scale continuous production due to limitations on 
throughput rate as well as the requirement for an extremely large 
drying apparatus. Accordingly, an alternative process was sought which provides a higher 
selectivity to the desired amido acid and which does not require the 
continuous removal of alkanol from the reactor. In addition, an 
alternative drying method was sought which could be used in large-scale 
production. These and other objects of the
