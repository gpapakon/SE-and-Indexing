<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for segmenting images composed of textures on the basis of digital signals representing the said images and by characterising each texture with the aid of parameters which are representative thereof and decomposition of each image into regions associated with the various textures, comprising, for the said texture characterisation, a sub-unit (100) for directional morphological filtering and a sub-unit (200) for determining texture parameters, as well as, at the output thereof, a sub-unit for segmenting into regions, by the so-called watershed extraction technique applied to a texture parameter image subdivided into blocks of specified size. A sequencing stage provides the various control signals for the said sub-units. Application: image processing, data compression.

A device for segmenting textured images on the basis of digital signals
which are representative of said images by characterization of each texture by means of

representative parameters and by decomposition of each image into regions associated with
different textures, said device comprising:


(A) for said characterization of the texture, a sub-assembly (100) for
directional morphological filtering, followed by a sub-assembly (200) for determining the

texture parameters;
(B) at the output of said sub-assembly for determining the parameters, a sub-assembly
(300) for segmentation into regions by means of the technique of extracting

watershed lines in a texture parameter image subdivided into blocks of a given size;
(C) a sequencing stage (600) for furnishing the different control signals of
said sub-assemblies;

said device being 
characterized in that
:

(A) said directional morphological filtering sub-assembly (100) comprises:

(a) a first memory (10) for storing the digital signals which are
representative of the image to be segmented;
(b) at the output of this first memory, a first four-position switch (5)
followed by a parallel arrangement of four directional morphological filtering circuits (11,

12, 13, 14);
(c) a second memory (20) for storing the four successively filtered
images obtained;
(d) a subtracter (25) and, at its output, a third memory (30) for
storing the four images of the residues successively obtained from the difference between

the original image and each of the four filtered images;
(B) said sub-assembly (200) for determining the texture parameters
comprises:


(e) a circuit (35) for integrating the images of the residues; 
(f) at the output of said circuit, a second four-position switch (36)
followed by four parallel branches each comprising a series arrangement of a fourth

memory for storing the image of the texture characteristics associated with the
corresponding filtering operation, a circuit for spatial sub-sampling of this image, a circuit

for computing the morphological gradient, and a fifth memory for storing said gradient;
(g) an adder (59) for the output signal of said fifth memories;
(h) a sixth memory (60) for storing the global gradient present at the
output of said adder
A segmentation device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it
comprises, at the output of the segmentation sub-assembly, a sub-assembly (500) for

sharpening the contours by repeating the extractions of the watershed lines for subdivisions
of the image into blocks of a smaller size, and this in an iterative way until the resolution of

a pixel is reached.
