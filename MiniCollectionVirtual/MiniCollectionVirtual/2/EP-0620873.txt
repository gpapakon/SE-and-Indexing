<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wraparound fabric sleeves of interlaced 
fibrous materials, the sleeves being preferably formed by a 
weaving process. More particularly, the invention relates to 
wraparound sleeves having a closure device and even more 
specifically to wraparound sleeves for the protection of 
elongated articles, such as cables wherein the sleeves are 
intended to provide protection from the effects of abrasion or 
heat as well as to maintain the elongated articles in a neatly 
bundled arrangement so that they are not damaged by moving 
machinery parts or the like. The use of flexible sleeves for the protection of cables, hoses 
and other elongated articles for the purposes above noted is well 
known. In addition, it is well known to secure the marginal 
edges of the sleeving material together by means of zipper type 
fastener elements. A product for this purpose is a sleeve formed 
of braided monofilament secured together by a zipper type 
fastener element. Such sleeving is sold by The Bentley-Harris  
 
Manufacturing Company under the trademark EXPANDO ZIP and is 
widely used in automotive as well as other applications, for 
example, for bundling cables and hose and the like in an 
automobile or truck engine compartment. Other types of sleeving 
available from The Bentley-Harris Manufacturing Company are 
woven, knitted or braided from materials such as monofilaments 
of engineered plastic materials, glass fibre, wire and bulky 
yarns and combinations thereof, depending upon the requirements 
of the particular application. In addition, other means of 
fastening sleeves of the type disclosed are known in the art. In 
addition to the use of zipper type fasteners, these include 
tongue and groove type elongated flexible plastic fasteners, 
VELCROâ„¢ hook and loop brand type tapes exposed along the 
marginal edges of the sleeving material (known from 
US-A-4791236), tape wraps and wire or tape ties. Despite the 
availability of the foregoing, the need exists for a simply 
reliable, relatively low cost system, for closure of a sleeve 
which will accommodate variations in the diameter of a bundle of 
elongated articles, such as cables having connectors intermediate 
their length, while allowing for cable breakouts at points where 
a cable is required to be connected to a particular instrument 
or item of equipment. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a ribbon or 
a web for the formation of a wraparound sleeve for protecting 
elongated articles, said web being comprised of a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A web (10) for the formation of a wraparound sleeve 
for protecting elongated articles, said web being 

comprised of a monofilament material (11, 12) and provided 
with an array of individual hook type fastener means (15) 

disposed along one marginal edge; characterised in that a 
bulky multifilament yarn (13) is interlaced with said 

monofilament material, said bulky multifilament yarn having 
portions exposed on the surface of said web in spaced 

relationship to said hook type fastener elements (15), said 
hook type fastener means including hook type fastener 

elements interengageable with the filaments of said bulky 
multifilament yarn (13) to secure said web in surrounding 

relationship to said elongated articles. 
A web according to claim 1 characterised in that said bulky 
multifilament warp yarn (13) is exposed on the inner and 

the outer surface of said sleeve for joinder by the hook 
type fastener means alternatively with the inner web 

surface or with the outer web surface. 
A web according to claim 1 characterised in that said hook 
type fastener means (15) comprises fastener hook tape (16) 

secured along said one marginal edge of said web. 
A web according to claim 3 further characterised by the 
inclusion of a row of bulky warp yarn (13) interlaced with 

said monofilament ends (11, 12) along the first marginal 
edge with the yarn surface exposed on the surface opposite 

to the surface carrying the fastener hook tape. 
A web according to claim 4 characterised in that said row 
of bulky warp yarn comprises a plurality of individual 

multifilament warp yarns.  
 
A web according to claim 5 further characterised by the 
inclusion of at least one additional row of multifilament 

warp yarn (20) spaced inwardly from said first named row of 
multifilament warp yarns (13). 
A web according to claim 2 further characterised by the 
inclusion of at least one row of bulky monofilament warp 

yarns spaced inwardly from the bulky monofilament warp yarn 
interlaced along said second marginal edge. 
A web according to claim 7 wherein said web is a braided 
web. 
A web according to claim 7 wherein said sleeve is a knitted 
web. 
A web according to claim 7 wherein said web is a woven web. 
A web according to claim 1 characterised in that said web 
is a woven web having monofilament weft, the hook type 

fastener means comprising hooks (22) formed integrally with 
the ends of the monofilament weft yarns exposed at the 

first marginal edge of the web. 
A web according to claim 4, characterised in that said web 
is wound into a roll form, the fastener means of 

said fastener hook tape and the said yarn surface along 
saied first marginal edge being relatively positioned for 

interengagement whereby the web resists unrolling. 
A web according to any of claims 1 to 12 in the form of a 
sleeve for the protection of elongated 

substrates, wherein said sleeve is comprised of interlaced 
filamentary material and is characterised in that one 

marginal edge is comprised of a band of bulky multifilament 
warp yarn (13) exposed on both the inner and the outer 

surface of said sleeve and hook type fasteners (15, 16, 22) 
extending along the opposite marginal edge of said sleeve,  

 
said hook type fasteners being interengageable with the 

bulky yarn (13) for closure of the sleeve around the 
elongate
d substrates. 
A web in the form of a sleeve according to claim 13, 
characterised in that said sleeve has a second band of 

bulky yarn extended on the marginal edge having said hook 
type fasteners on the surface of the sleeve opposite to the 

surface having the fasteners, the sleeve being wound into 
a compact roll form with the hook type fasteners 

(15) and bulky yarn (13) yieldably holding the sleeve in 
said roll form. 
A web according to claim 1 characterised in that said bulky 
multifilament yarn extends in the fill (weft) direction. 
A web according to claim 1 characterised in that said bulky 
multifilament warp yarn is exposed in a band extending 

lengthwise yarn of said second marginal edge on the inner 
and the outer surface of said sleeve for joinder by the
