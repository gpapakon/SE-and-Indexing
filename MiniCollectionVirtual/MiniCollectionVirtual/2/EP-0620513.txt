<ABSTRACT>
A balanced voltage-to-current converter has two cells (24A; 24B). Each 
cell has a first input terminal (6A; 6B) coupled to a first current source (4A; 4B) 
via
 a 
diode-connected first transistor (T1A; T1B) and to an output terminal (18A; 18B) 
via
 
the main current path of a third transistor (T3A; T3B), and a second input terminal 

(10A; 10B) coupled to a second current source (14A; 14B) 
via
 the main current path of 
a second transistor (T2A; T2B). The control electrode of the third transistor (T3A; 

T3B) is connected to the node (8A; 8B) between the second current source (14A; 14B) 
and the second transistor (T2A; T2B). The first input terminal of one of cell is 

connected to the second input terminal of the other cell and 
vice versa
. The quiescent 
current through the third transistor (T3A; T3B) is controlled by a differential amplifier 

(40A; 40B) which compares the voltage difference between the control electrode and the 
first main electrode of the third transistor (T3A; T3B) with a reference voltage (44A; 

44B) which is representative of the current through the third transistor (T3A; T3B). The 
output signals of the differential amplifiers (40A; 40B) are summed in an adder (50) and 

are applied to control inputs (54A; 54B) of the second current sources (14A; 14B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a voltage-to-current converter comprising a first 
cell, which cell comprises: a first input terminal, a second input terminal and an output 
terminal, a first current source, a first transistor having a first main electrode, a second 
main electrode and a control electrode, having a main current path defined by the first 
and the second main electrode of the first transistor and coupled to the first current 
source in a first node for the passage of a first current to be supplied by the first current 
source, and having a junction defined by the first main electrode and the control 
electrode of the first transistor and connected in a forward direction between the first 
node and the first input terminal, a second current source, a second transistor of a first 
conductivity type, having a first main electrode connected to the second input terminal, 
a control electrode connected to the first node, and a second main electrode coupled to 
the second current source in a second node, and a third transistor of the first 
conductivity type, having a first main electrode connected to the first input terminal, a 
control electrode connected to the second node, and a second main electrode coupled to 
the output terminal. Such a voltage-to-current converter is known from United States Patent 
4,574,233. When an input voltage source is connected to the first input terminal via a 
conversion resistor this will produce an input current from the first input terminal to the 
output terminal via the third transistor. The second input terminal is connected to the 
first supply terminal, which acts as a reference voltage source. The input current begins 
to flow as soon as the voltage of the input voltage source has become smaller than the 
reference voltage of the reference voltage source. This known converter has a 
substantially linear transmission from the first input terminal to the output terminal but 
operates only for one current direction of the input current. This problem can be solved 
by duplicating the known converter as a first cell and a second cell, one cell having its 
second input terminal connected to the first input terminal of the other cell. However, 
this gives rise to a problem with the quiescent-current setting of the third transistor in 
each of the two cells. As a result of tolerances the quiescent current is not only  
 
indeterminate but the quiescent current of the third transistor in one cell also flows 
through the conversion resistor of the other cell and vice
