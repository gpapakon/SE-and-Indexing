<ABSTRACT>
An induction cooking plate (1) is proposed which makes it possible to use suitable cooking vessels (20) which have base areas of different shapes and sizes. A plurality of cooking vessels (20) can also be heated simultaneously on one cooking plate (1). A plurality of cooking plates (1) according to the invention form an actual cooking zone (3) which is suitable, in addition to household kitchens, in particular also for canteen kitchens. As a result, controlling the cooking power can be simplified to a large extent and reduced to an on/off switch which is combined with a current limitation for each cooking plate (1).

<CLAIMS>
Induction hob (1) for inductively heating cooking
vessels (21, 22, 23), comprising a magnetically permeable

cover and at least one cooking area (3) having a coil
(10) which is arranged under the cover and parallel

thereto and which comprises a bundle of a plurality of
thin wires (13) which are wound in the form of a spiral

in one layer in a rectangular shape about a rectangular
centre, characterized in that the rectangular centre

forms a rectangular air gap (11), whose length is a
multiple of its width, in such a way that a plurality of

cooking vessels (21, 22, 23) can be arranged along the
length of the air gap (11) and the width of the air gap

(11) is such that a cooking vessel can completely cover
the width.
Induction hob (1) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the coil (10) forms a rectangle whose

length corresponds at least to twice its width.
Induction hob (1) according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the length of the coil (10) corresponds

approximately to the width of the hob (1).
Induction hob (1) according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the coil (10) can be controlled

by an on/off switch and a current limiter.
Induction hob according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that a plurality of cooking areas (3)

are arranged next to one another under a common cover,
and in that each of the coils (10) of these cooking areas

(3) is provided with an on/off switch and a current
limiter, each current limiter being preset to a different

predetermined value as a power limiter.
