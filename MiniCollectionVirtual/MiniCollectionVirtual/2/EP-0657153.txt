<ABSTRACT>
A disposable diaper (1) of pants type has front and rear bodies (5, 6) 
bonded to each other by a series of welded zones (10) along transversely 

opposite sides of front and rear waist sections. The welded zones (10) are at least 
partially defined by patterns of V-shape or patterns of V-shape being devoid of a 

sharp point, both laid down transversely of the diaper, or patterns of an arc 
opening transversely of the diaper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable diaper,
more particularly to pants-type disposable diaper.It is well known for pants-type disposable diapers
comprising heat-weldable top- and backsheets to seal
front and rear bodies to each other by means of heat
welding along transversely opposite sides of front and rear
waist sections. For example, EP-A-0 531 666 (& JP-A-05 0 15 551),
of which the applicant is the
same as the applicant of the present application, discloses
a sealing technique for pants-type diapers, by which a
series of intermittent rectangular welded zones each having
a long side extending in parallel to a waist line of the
diaper are longitudinally arranged along each lateral side
of the front and rear waist sections utilizing an
ultrasonic welding. Use of this technique enables the
diaper put on a wearer to be easily stripped off merely
tearing off the diaper along the sealed side edges of the
diaper. This technique is advantageous also in that the
interior of the diaper is always maintained in good 
communication with the exterior of the diaper and thereby
a diaper of high air-permeability is obtained.Tearing off tends to take place along a peripheral edge
of each welded zone as the diaper is torn off. The sheets
usually used to form the diaper comprise a thin nonwoven
fabric or a plastic film of a relatively small weight per
unit area and a correspondingly low tear strength, since,
after the sheets have been welded to each other, the welded
zone exhibits a tear strength higher than that exhibited by
the nonwelded zone and a tearing force is concentrated
along a boundary between the welded zone and the nonwelded
zone. Consequently, there is an apprehension that a tear
might progress circumferentially, i.e., transversely into
the front and/or rear bodies as the diaper is torn off
along the long side of each rectangular welded zone,
instead of being torn longitudinally of the diaper. Such
undesirable phenomenon will readily occur particularly when
both the top- and backsheets have a tear strength in the transverse
direction significantly lower than a tear strength in the
longitudinal direction. Unless the diaper is torn off in the
longitudinal direction, it will be impossible to
relieve the wearer from the diaper as quickly as possible.Accordingly, a principal object of the invention to 
solve the problem as has been mentioned above by providing
a diaper with welded zones at least partially defined by
patterns each having contours diverging transversely of the
diaper so that the diaper

<CLAIMS>
A disposable diaper comprising a liquid-permeable topsheet (2), a liquid-impermeable
backsheet (3) and a liquid-absorbent core (4) sandwiched between

said sheets (2, 3) which are heat-weldable, and forming front and rear bodies (5,
6), said front and rear bodies (5, 6) providing front and rear waist sections having

transversely opposite side portions defined by portions extending outwards from
transversely opposite side edges of said liquid-absorbent core (4), said front and

rear bodies (5,6) being sealed to each other along said side portions by a series
of intermittent welded zones (10) arranged longitudinally along the respective side

portions, characterized in that said welded zones (10) are at least partially defined
by patterns (19) each having an outer contour formed substantially in a V-shape

laid down transversely of the diaper or an arc shape opening transversely of said
diaper.
A disposable diaper according to claim 1, wherein said outer contour is
devoid of the sharp point of the V-shape.
A disposable diaper according to claim 1 or 2, including elastic members
(13, 14) provided along peripheries of the waist and leg openings (11, 12) of the

diaper and wherein said welded zones (10) are provided between the lowermost
one of the elastic members (13) provided along the peripheries of the waist-opening

(11) and the uppermost one of the elastic members (14) provided along
the peripheries of the leg-openings (12).
A disposable diaper according to claim 3, wherein said welded zones (10)
include further patterns (17, 18) intermittently provided between the elastic

members (13, 14).
A disposable diaper according to claim 4, wherein said further patterns (17,
18) are each substantially rectangular in shape.
