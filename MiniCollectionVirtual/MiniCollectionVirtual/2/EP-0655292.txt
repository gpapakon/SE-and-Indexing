<ABSTRACT>
When carrying out multi-spot welding, the electric welding circuits (3.1 ... 3.16) are activated in such a way that successive welding intervals (I1 and I2 or I2 and I3 ..., respectively) partly overlap, i.e. by more than 0% and less than 100%. This permits a graduation with reduced maximum power input when welding wire grids and the like. Excessive deformation of the cross-wire (1) to be welded in the case of narrow-mesh wire grids can thus be avoided.

Process for performing multi-spot 
welding, in particular for operating a grid 

welding machine, wherein various points are welded 
at welding intervals (I
1
, ..., I
16
) which are 
staggered as regards time by means of a plurality 

of welding currents which are controlled 
separately, characterised in that the staggering 

is selected such that welding intervals which 
follow one another in time overlap partly, ie. by 

more than 0% and less than 100%, in each case, for 
the purpose of minimising the mechanical 

deformation of the workpiece. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the welding intervals are 

staggered in such a manner that they overlap by at 
least 50%. 
Application of the process according to 
Claim 1 or 2 for welding a transverse wire (1) to 

longitudinal wires (2.1, 2.2, ...), wherein points 
which are adjacent as regards location are also 

welded at welding intervals (I
1
, I
2
, ...) which 
follow one another in time.  

 
Application according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the staggering runs from one 

end of the transverse wire (1) to the other or 
from the middle to both ends. 
Application according to Claim 3 or 4 for 
welding structural steel mats of a mesh size of 

100 mm or less. 
Grid welding machine for performing the 
process according to Claims 1 to 5, having fixed 

first electrodes (3.1, 3.2, ...) and movably 
mounted opposite bridge electrodes (4.1, 4.2, ...) 

characterised by a control device (7) which is 
formed such that welding intervals of welding 

current circuits which are staggered behind one 
another overlap partially, ie. by more than 0% and 

less than 100%, as regards time. 
Grid welding machine according to Claim 
6, characterised in that welding intervals which 

follow one another as regards time overlap by at 
least two thirds. 
Grid welding machine according to Claim 6 
or 7, characterised in that the control circuit 

(7) can be switched over to block welding.  
 
Grid welding machine according to one of 
Claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the control 

circuit (7) is formed such that the welding 

current circuits are cascaded from the middle of 
the transverse wire (1) to the two ends or from 

one end to the other. 
Grid welding machine according to one of 
Claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the welding 

current circuits are formed as alternating current 
circuits.
