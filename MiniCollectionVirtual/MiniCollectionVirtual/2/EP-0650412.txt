<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer printing receiver sheet which comprises a substrate having a dye-receiving surface on one side and a backcoat on the other side wherein the backcoat comprises a sulphonated polyester and preferably a cellulosic polymer and an electrically conductive particulate material. The receiver is suitable for use in applications in which writability and adhesion of for example aqueous based gums to the backcoat are desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal transfer printing (TTP) 
receiver sheet and especially to a TTP receiver sheet having a 
backcoat which possesses improved properties. Thermal transfer printing is a printing process in which a dye is 
caused, by thermal stimuli, to transfer from a dye sheet to a receiver 
sheet. In such processes, the dye sheet and receiver sheet are placed 
in intimate contact, the thermal stimuli are applied to the dye sheet 
and the dye sheet and receiver sheet are then separated. By applying 
the thermal stimuli to pre-determined areas in the dye-sheet, the dye 
is selectively transferred to the receiver to form the desired image. EP-A-272400 discloses a dye sheet bearing a 
subbing layer on its reverse side, said subbing layer 
comprising a sulphonated polyester. The subbing layer 
provides improved adhesion of an anti-slipping layer to the 
base sheet of the dye sheet.  
 Receiver sheets conventionally comprise a substrate with a 
dye-receiving polar surface on one side, into which a dye is thermally 
transferable and retainable. Where the substrate is itself polar and 
capable of receiving a dye, the dye may be transferred directly to a 
surface of the substrate. However receiver sheets typically comprise 
a substrate supporting a receiver layer specifically tailored to 
receive the dye. Receiver sheets may also comprise a backcoat on the opposite 
surface to the dye-receiving surface which is typically employed to 
impart desirable characteristics to the sheet to improve both 
processing of the sheet during application of the TTP image and the 
end use properties of the sheet depending on the particular 
application of the sheet. In many applications, for example for use as post cards and 
greetings cards, it is a requirement that the backcoat be capable of 
receiving drafting marks from for example pencils and inks, both 
aqueous and solvent based. Other characteristics which the backcoat 
should desirably possess when employed in such applications include a 
good resistance to smudging of the applied drafting marks and an 
ability to accept aqueous based adhesives, for example to allow 
adherence of a postage stamp to the sheet. Hitherto, receiver sheets for use in such applications have been 
deficient in certain respects due to the combination of properties 
which it is desired that such a receiver sheet should possess.  
 However, we have now devised a receiver sheet which has a 
backcoat having an improved combination of characteristics which make 
the sheet
