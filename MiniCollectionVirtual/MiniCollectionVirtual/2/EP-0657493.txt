<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of an article, including a stage of surface treatment of at least a portion of the article in the substantial absence of oxygen; the surface of the article which is to be treated consists of a material which includes at least one polyolefin and which includes less than 5 mg of oxygen per kg (not taking into account possible additives).

<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of an article, comprising a surface
treatment step of at least part of the article in the substantial absence of oxygen,

characterized in that the surface layer of the article which is to be treated consists
of a material which comprises at least one polyolefin and which contains less

than 5 mg of oxygen per kg, independently of the oxygen which may be
contained in the optional additives incorporated into this material.
Process according to Claim 1, in which the article is a hollow body.
Process according to Claim 2, in which the hollow body is a fuel tank.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the
polyolefin is high-density polyethylene.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the
surface treatment is a fluorination treatment.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, according to which the
material constituting the surface layer consists essentially of polyolefin.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, additionally
comprising a prior step of processing of the article.
Process according to Claim 7, in which the prior processing step
consists of an extrusion blow-moulding step.
Process according to Claim 7 or 8, in which the processing step is
performed in the substantial absence of oxygen.
Process according to one of Claims 7 to 9, additionally comprising a
step of conditioning of the material comprising the polyolefin before its processing

and the surface treatment of the article.
Use of a material comprising at least one polyolefin and containing
less than 5 mg of oxygen per kg, independently of the oxygen which may be

contained in the optional additives incorporated into this material, for the
manufacture of an article at least part of the surface layer of which is intended to be

treated in the substantial absence of oxygen. 
Article at least part of which is intended to be surface treated in the
substantial absence of oxygen, characterized in that the surface layer which is to be

treated consists of a material which comprises at least one polyolefin and contains
less than 5 mg of oxygen per kg, independently of the oxygen which may be

contained in the optional additives incorporated into this material.
Fuel tank consisting essentially of high density polyethylene which
has undergone a surface fluorination treatment, characterized in that its

permeability after a "slosh test" does not exceed 0.2 gram CARB.
