<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a matrix type
display apparatus, i.e. a passive matrix type display
apparatus to be driven by simultaneously selecting a
plurality of row electrodes and using signals transformed
by an orthogonal function. In particular, the present
invention relates to a display apparatus showing a change
of the light transmittance when a voltage applied to the
intersection of a lateral electrode and a longitudinal
electrode arranged in a matrix form, i.e. a row electrode
and a column electrode, exceeds a threshold value.A conventional technique will be described by taking
a liquid crystal display apparatus as an example. A data
electrode is referred to as a column electrode and a
scanning electrode is referred to as a row electrode.
There have been known the following systems in driving a
passive matrix type liquid crystal display panel
comprising an Nr number of row electrodes and an Mc
number of column electrodes. One of the systems is a so-called 
successive line scanning method wherein a group of
pixel signals corresponding to pixels on an arbitrary
line of row electrodes are applied to column electrodes,
and at the same time, row electrode selection voltages
are applied to the row electrodes to thereby select
pixels, and the light transmittance of each of the pixels
selected is changed; and the above-mentioned operation is
effected to scan the Nr number of row electrodes for each
of the electrodes. The other system is known as a multi-line
selection and driving system wherein a plurality of
row electrodes are simultaneously selected by using an
orthogonal transformation and composite signals
corresponding to the selected electrodes, which are
subjected to orthogonal transformation, are applied to
column electrodes.In the liquid crystal display apparatus, the light
transmittance of a pixel has a threshold characteristic
which relies on the effective value of a voltage applied
to the pixel. In the above-mentioned driving method, it
has been known that the condition to obtain the ratio of
the maximum and minimum values of light transmittance,
i.e. the largest contrast ratio can be expressed by
formula (1) (reference document: Scanning Limitations of
Liquid-Crystal-Displays, IEEE Transactions on Electron
Devices, vol. ED-21, No. 2, February 1974, pp146-155 by
Paul M. Alt, Peter Pleshko):
Vr/Vc = Nr 1/2Under the condition of the formula (1), the ratio of
the effective value Von of a pixel voltage which provides
the maximum (or the minimum) light transmittance to the
effective value
