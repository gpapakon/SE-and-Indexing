<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel thermoplastic
resin composition which is used in the production of a molded article
by injection molding and extrusion molding.In general, a polyphenylene ether has excellent properties
such as heat resistance, hot water resistance, dimensional stability,
and mechanical and electrical properties, while it has some drawbacks
such as poor moldability due to high melt viscosity, low chemical
resistance and low heat impact resistance.As a composition which improves the moldability by decreasing
the melt viscosity while maintaining other good properties
of the polyphenylene ether, there is known a composition comprising
the polyphenylene ether and a polystyrene resin. However, the chemical
resistance is not improved.Since polyolefin is excellent in moldability, toughness,
water resistance and chemical resistance, has a low specific gravity
and is cheap, it is widely used as a raw material of various molded
articles, a film or a sheet.However, the polyolefin is insufficient in heat resistance,
stiffness, impact resistance, coating properties or adhesion,
or should be improved in such properties. This prevent new application
of the polyolefin. In particular, improvement of the heat resistance
and the impact resistance is highly desired. In view of the above circumstances, it may be expected
that a wide variety of new applications could be found if the polyphenylene
ether and the polyolefin were compounded to give a resin
composition having the good properties of the both polymers and
improved moldability and impact resistance.However, practically, the polyphenylene ether and the
polyolefin have poor compatibility with each other even if they are
compounded, so that, in a molded article produced by the injection
molding, the polyphenylene ether and the polyolefin are phase separated,
and the article has extremely poor appearance and deteriorated
mechanical properties and cannot be used practically.To improve the compatibility between the polyphenylene
ether and a propylene polymer, for example, EP-A-329 423 discloses
the use of a propylene polymer to which a styrene monomer is graft
polymerized in combination with the polyphenylene ether.EP-A-329 423 discloses that a composition having good
heat resistance and mechanical properties is obtained by compounding
the propylene polymer to which styrene or a mixture of styrene
and a monomer copolymerizable with styrene is grafted or a rubber
in the polyphenylene ether. JP-A-173137/1990
discloses a resin composition comprising
