<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic hysteresis clutch comprises a rotor (70) 
supporting a ferromagnetic hysteresis material (80,81,82,83) and a rotary 

magnetic inductor (58) capable of inducing a magnetic field 
in the ferromagnetic hysteresis. The magnetic inductor (58) 

and the ferromagnetic hysteresis material preferably define 
a radial air gap (78). The magnetic hysteresis clutch is 

designed so that an increase in the magnetization losses in 
the ferromagnetic material, which accompanies an increase 

in the slip between magnetic inductor (58) and the 
ferromagnetic hysteresis (80,81,82,83), leads to a reversible increase in 

the temperature of the ferromagnetic hysteresis material, 
and thereby to a reversible decrease in magnetization of 

the ferromagnetic material which is sufficient to bring 
about a desired decrease in the transmitted torque. Thus it 

is possible to provide a magnetic hysteresis clutch in 
which the transmitted torque reversibly decreases when the 

slip increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic hysteresis 
clutch. Such a clutch comprises in particular a rotor supporting a 
ferromagnetic hysteresis material and a rotary magnetic 
inductor which induces a magnetic field in the hysteresis 
ferromagnetic material of the rotor. The magnetic inductor 
and the hysteresis magnetic material are arranged with an 
air gap between the two, so as to allow relative rotation 
of one with respect to the other. The coupling between the 
magnetic inductor and the magnetic armature takes place by 
magnetization and demagnetization of the ferromagnetic 
hysteresis material which is in relative rotation with 
respect to the magnetic field. These magnetic hysteresis clutches are used to transmit a 
torque from an input shaft of the clutch to an output shaft 
of the clutch in the case where there are significant 
differences between the speed of rotation of the input 
shaft and the speed of rotation of the output shaft of the 
clutch. A typical application of these magnetic hysteresis 
clutches is found in a reeling-in/reeling-out device 
delivering a reeling-in torque and a braking torque during 
reeling-out. In such a device, the input shaft of the 
clutch is coupled to the drive motor which has a nearly 
constant speed of rotation. The output shaft of the clutch 
is coupled to a reeling-in/reeling-out drum. The speed of 
rotation of the reeling-in/reeling-out drum passes through  
 
zero and changes sense, whereas the speed of rotation of 
the motor is substantially constant. If the maximum speed 
of rotation of the output shaft of the clutch represents 
50% of the speed of rotation of the input shaft of the 
clutch, both during the reeling-out operation and during 
the reeling-in operation, the slip between the magnetic 
inductor and the magnetic armature of the clutch increases 
by 200% between the reeling-in operation and the reeling-out 
operation. This is because, during the reeling-in 
operation, the output shaft of the clutch rotates in the 
same direction as the input shaft, whereas, during the 
reeling-out operation, the output shaft of the clutch 
rotates in the opposite direction to that of the input 
shaft. In a conventional magnetic hysteresis clutch, the torque 
transmitted increases with the slip between the magnetic 
inductor and the magnetic armature. This phenomenon is due 
to the fact that the magnetic field rotating with respect 
to the magnetic armature generates eddy currents in the 
latter which increase the coupling between the magnetic 
inductor
