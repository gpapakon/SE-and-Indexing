<DESCRIPTION>
 AC TO DC AND DC POWERED BATTERY RECLAIMER AND AINTAINERFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates in general to battery maintenance and more particularly/ to a voltage power source powered battery reclaiming/ maintaining and current charging for liquid electrolyte and jell electrolyte supplied batteries.A characteristic of liquid electrolyte type batteries particularly lead acid batteries is that chemical compound deposits slowly build up on the plates to partially or entirely cover, and displace the normal plate surfaces. Low current recharging is inadequate in that it cannot/ as such/ sufficiently remove such deposits that with the passage of time crystallize and choke the battery plates by interfering blockage of electrolyte movement. Through the years many people have tried to dislodge these deposits, by "Fast Charging" and high current pulse charging approches that generally ultimately overheat and warp the lead plates in a lead acid battery. When this occurs a battery may still appear to have taken a charge and even the electrolyte may check as being correct but the battery does not hold the charge as the plates are effectively shorted. The transfer between metal (lead) electrodes and ions in a solution is not instantaneous. Thus, there is a series of sufficiently fast rise time voltage pulses to voltage levels above the theoretical cell voltage in close to instantaneous voltage. This causes a skin effect over the entire lead plate surfaces and the lead sulfation that is built up on plate surfaces will be released, going back into the solution. Batteries using other electrolytes also face reclaiming/ maintenance and charging problems that need to be successfully addressed. 

 It is therefore/ a principle object of this invention to provide a voltage power source powered combination reclaiming/ maintaining and charging circuit for batteries. Another object is to provide such a combination reclaiming/ and maintaining circuit capable of removing current blocking deposits from battery plates.A further object is to prevent overheating and warpage of plates in a battery when charging efforts are made to dislodge deposits from battery plates, and to prevent explosion of batteries with overheating.Still another object is to significantly extend the useful life service life and reliability of batteries at reasonable cost. Features of the invention useful in accomplishing the above objects include/ in AC to DC and DC powered battery reclaimer and maintainer units, a voltage power source that supplies
