<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polyolefines with improved adhesivity, especially to cyanacrylate adhesives. An improvement in adhesion to such adhesives is obtained by incorporated polymerisation initiators, especially sterically inhibited bases like diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene(DBU) and 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]
-non-5-ene(DBN). The invention also relates to a process for improving the adhesivity of polyolefines in which polymerisation initiators like DBU or DBN are incorporated during extrusion or injection, for example.
