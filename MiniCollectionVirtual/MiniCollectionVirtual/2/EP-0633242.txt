<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heptanoate 
derivative represented by the following general formula 
(I), which can be useful as an intermediate for producing 
an anti-hypercholesterolemic agent, which has an 
inhibitory effect on, for instance, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA 
reductase (hereinafter referred to as HMG-CoA 
Reductase): 
wherein R¹ and R² are independently a hydrogen atom or a 
protective group for hydroxyl group, or R¹ and R² taken 
together constitute a protective group for hydroxyl 
groups; and R³ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group which may 
be substituted , or an aromatic hydrocarbon group. Compounds having as a substituent an (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid moiety which is bonded thereto 
at the 7-position thereof, which are hereinafter referred 
to as 7-position-substituted (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic  
 
acid compounds, serve as HMG-CoA Reductase 
inhibitors. Many methods of synthesizing such 7-position-substituted 
(E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid 
compounds, including the methods of synthesizing optical 
active compounds thereof, have been reported. The substituent at the 7-position of the (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid moiety of the above-mentioned 
7-position-substituted (E)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid 
compounds (hereinafter referred to the 7-position 
substituent) is a key substituent for the generation of 
the inhibitory activity against the HMG-CoA Reductase. 
Examples of such a 7-position substituent include an 
aromatic group, heterocyclic group, and a substituted 
vinyl group. Methods of introducing the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic 
acid unit into this 7-position substituent can be roughly 
classified into the following three methods: 
(I) A method of introducing a C3 carbon chain into 
the 7-position substituent, followed by the introduction 
of a C4 carbon chain. 
This method includes, for instance, the following 
specific methods: 
(I-1) A method of introducing as the C4 carbon 
chain a β-keto ester (J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 170, J. 
Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 5752). (I-2) A method of introducing as the C4 carbon  
 
chain a C2 carbon chain for asymmetric induction, 
followed by the introduction of a C2 carbon chain 
(Tetrahedron Lett, 1984, 25, 5031). (I-3) A method of introducing as the C4 carbon 
chain an optical active C4 carbon chain which is derived 
from isoascorbic acid through complicated steps 
(Tetrahedron Lett, 1985, 26, 2951). (II) A method of introducing a C1 carbon chain into 
the 7-position substituent structure, followed by the 
introduction
