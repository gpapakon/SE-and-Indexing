<ABSTRACT>
The invention features a coupler (59) that is 
substantially disposed around an armature (70), and is 

constructed to provide an axial force-transmitting 
relationship between a carrier (72) and the armature (70) for 

blocking and unblocking the passage of fluids between the 
first and second passages. The force-transmitting 

relationship is characterized by the carrier (72) being 
capable of axial movement relative to the armature (70), while 

the carrier (72) substantially following the motion of the 
armature (70) for both blocking and unblocking the passage of 

fluids between the first and second passages. The 
coupler (58) includes coaxially nested coupling and blocking 

springs (82,98) that provide equal spring forces and are removed 
from the direct passage of fluid between the first and 

second fluid passages (24,26). The solenoid is reversible in 
orientation such that the electrical connectors (49) can be 

situated on either the manifold face, or 180° on the 
opposite face.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of fluids using solenoid-actuated valves.Solenoid-actuated valves operate by supplying a known quantity of current through
a solenoid that generates a magnetic field. The magnetic field attracts a movable internal
element of the valve that selectively blocks or unblocks the flow of fluid through the valve.
These valves are intended to operate accurately and efficiently to produce a controlled fluid
flow between two or more fluid flow passages.Conventional valve designs typically have a spring for one valve seat, typically
normally open, sufficient in force to seal against a required pressure, and a second spring
for the opposite valve seat, typically normally closed, sufficient in force to both seal against
a required pressure and to overcome the force of the opposite (normally open) spring.
Typically, the normally closed spring must provide more force than the normally open
spring This requires stronger and perhaps heavier springs, as well as a larger solenoid to
overcome the force of the larger normally closed spring.Typical valves that employ internal springs also have one or both springs located
in the path of fluid flow, therefore the media that the valve controls can act to wear or
corrode the springs Other valves generally isolate the springs from the active flow path
with a diaphragm or protective barrier.There are many applications for fluid control valves in for example, the medical,
chemical and semiconductor industries, such as, in chemical analysis, filtration, pumping
systems, and gas delivery equipment The cost associated with each cubic metre of
building space has made it highly advantageous to reduce the size of the equipment
employed in these industries.The present invention provides a solenoid-actuated valve comprising: 
   a solenoid having an axially-extending solenoid cavity; a valve body having
a first fluid passage, a second fluid passage, and a valve seat between the first and second
fluid passages; an armature positioned within the solenoid cavity, the armature being at
least in part axially movable within the solenoid cavity; a carrier for blocking and
unblocking the passage of fluids between the first and second fluid passages; a closing
spring coupled between the valve body and the armature; and a coupling spring coupled
between the carrier and the armature, the coupling spring providing an axial force-transmitting
relationship between the carrier and the armature for blocking and unblocking
the passage of fluids between the first and
