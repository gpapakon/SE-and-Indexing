<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cement compositions which 
contain a shrinkage reducing amount of synergistic combination of 
a monoether of the formula R1O(AO)n H wherein A is a C2-C4 alkylene 
group or a combination of C2-C4 alkylene groups, n is 1-10, and R1 
is a C1-C10 alkyl or cycloalkyl group, together with 
a dihydroxy compound of the formula HO(AO)nH 
where A is as above described and n is 1-8. An important disadvantage of cement mortar and concrete is the 
tendency to shrink and crack upon setting and drying. U.S. Patent 4,547,223 and published Japanese Application 59-128240 
address this problem and suggest the use of compounds of the 
general formula: 
RO(AO)nH 
in which R represents a C1-7 alkyl or C5-6 cycloalkyl radical, A 
represents one or more C2-3 alkylene radicals, and n is 1-10 as 
shrinkage reducing additives for cement. U.S. Patent 5,174,820 suggests reducing the dry shrinkage of 
cement by the addition thereto of terminal alkyletherified or  
 
terminal alkylesterified compounds of polymers having -C2H5O- 
and/or -C3H6O- as a repetitive unit. Japan Patent Application No. 58-60293 suggests reducing dry 
shrinkage of cement by the addition thereto of compounds of the 
formula: 
R1OXmYnR2 
where R1 and R2 represent aliphatics, alicyclics or aromatics 
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, X represents -CH2CH20-, Y represents 
-CH(CH3)CH2O-, m and n are 1 or greater, and m + n is 1 to 15. Ostrikov, et al., Kolloidnyi Zhumal, Vol. 27, pp 82-86 (1965) 
suggests the addition of anhydrous glycerin to cement. U.S. Patent 5,181,961 relates to the use of compounds of the 
formula ROH where R is an alkyl group having 4 to 6 carbon atoms or 
a cycloalkyl group having 5 to 6 carbon atoms as shrink reducing 
cement additives. The patent mentions that other shrinkage-reducing 
agents may be jointly used. Canadian Patent 967,321 suggests the use of polyoxyalkylene 
glycols, esters, ethers and mixtures to reduce foaming in 
cementitious mixtures and the like. Despite the efforts of prior workers, the problem of shrinkage 
and crack formation in the drying and setting of cement 
compositions remains a serious problem. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found 
that dry shrinkage and cracking of cement compositions can be 
significantly reduced by incorporating in the cement composition an  
 
effective amount of a synergistic additive combination of a 
component having the formula R1O(AO)nH wherein A is a C2-C4 
alkylene group or a combination of C2-C4 alkylene groups, n is 1-10, 
and R1
