<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an oil absorbent natural polymer in
the preparation of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as a carrier for drugs,
additives, binders and pigments. More particularly, this invention relates to
the use of highly absorbent starch that has been spray dried in the presence of
a latent gas and that is in the form of minute spheres having an open hollow
cavity.Many of the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, or
agricultural chemicals are oils, semisolid fats, or oil soluble compounds.
Conventional cosmetics, for example, may contain vegetable, animal and mineral
oils, fats, waxes, esters, coloring agents, fragrances, preservatives,
antioxidants, and sunscreens, all of which may be oils or oil soluble. Likewise,
in the field of pharmaceuticals, many active ingredients, such as drugs and
vitamins, are oils or are oil soluble. Historically, starch, talc, carbonates,
and kaolin have been used either as essential ingredients or as charges or
fillers in combination with the oils or oil soluble actives for pharmaceutical
and cosmetic preparations. In the agricultural field, herbicides and pesticides
are routinely combined with dry-form carriers to convert to powders for ease of
handling and depositing.The ease and efficiency of dry-form carriers makes this a preferred method
of delivery for many compounds. Nevertheless, the actual physical combination
of powdered and oil soluble ingredients is difficult to achieve cleanly and
uniformly, and the blend often results in a composition that is not homogeneous
and that is difficult to handle. In a cosmetic preparation, the result can be
an oily or sticky cosmetic that lacks an acceptable skin feel. In a
pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical preparation, the lack of homogeneity
correlates to a deficiency in the uniformity of dose.Blending oils, semisolid fats, or oil soluble ingredients with powders is
typically accomplished by mechanically mixing the ingredients together with
impellers or by a combination of spraying the oily ingredients onto powders that 
are simultaneously being tumbled and mixed with impellers. Spraying techniques
frequently take place under conditions of elevated temperatures and pressure,
conditions that can lead to loss or degradation of the oily active ingredient.Therefore, there is still a need for a means of blending oils, semisolid
fats, or oil soluble ingredients with powdered ingredients that is mechanically
clean and efficient and that results in a homogeneous distribution of the oily
ingredients

<CLAIMS>
A method of homogeneously delivering an oil or an oil soluble substance
into a cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition comprising:


blending the oil or oil soluble substance onto a polymer derived from a
starch, dextrin, or gum that has been solubilized and then spray dried in the

presence of a latent gas to achieve a bulk density of about 0.1g/cm
3
 and a surface
area of between 1-2 m
2
/gram and that results in the formation of minute spheres
having an open hollow cavity and ranging in size up to about 120 microns until the

oil or oil soluble substance is adsorbed onto the polymer, and
introducing the polymer with adsorbed oil or oil soluble substance into the
cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition.
The method according to claim 1 in which the oil or oil soluble substance
is blended into the polymer at a level up to about four times the weight of the

polymer.
A method of sustaining release of an oil or oil soluble active ingredient
in a cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition comprising delivering to the cosmetic

or pharmaceutical composition the oil or oil soluble ingredient adsorbed onto a
polymer derived from a starch, dextrin, or gum that has been solubilized and then

spray dried in the presence of a latent gas to achieve a bulk density of about
0.1g/cm
3
 and a surface area of between 1-2 m
2
/gram and that results in the formation
of minute spheres having an open hollow cavity and ranging in size up to about 120

microns wherein the oil or oil soluble substance desorbs from the polymer over time.
A composition for use in cosmetics or pharmaceuticals comprising a polymer
derived from a starch, dextrin, or gum that has been solubilized and then spray

dried in the presence of a latent gas to achieve a bulk density of about 0.1g/cm
3

and a surface area of between 1-2 m
2
/gram and that results in the formation of
minute spheres having an open hollow cavity and ranging in size up to about 120

microns onto which has been adsorbed an oil or an oil soluble active ingredient. 
The composition according to claim 4 in which the active ingredient is
selected from the group consisting of dyes, pigments, pharmaceutical drugs,

herbicides, pesticides, insect repellants, sunscreens, fragrances, vitamins, castor
oil, lanolin alcohols, paraffin oils, and silicon oils.
The composition according to claim 4 in which the active ingredient is
adsorbed onto the polymer at a level up to about four times the weight of the

polymer.
A composition containing an oil or oil soluble cosmetically or
pharmaceutically active ingredient adsorbed onto a polymer derived from a starch,

dextrin, or gum that has been solubilized and then spray dried in the presence of
a latent gas to achieve a bulk density of about 0.1g/cm
3
 and a surface area of
between 1-2 m
2
/gram and that results in the formation of minute spheres having an
open hollow cavity and ranging in size up to about 120 microns.
The composition according to claim 7 in which the active ingredient is
selected from the group consisting of dyes, pigments, pharmaceutical drugs,

herbicides, pesticides, insect repellants, sunscreens, fragrances, vitamins, castor
oil, lanolin alcohols, paraffin oils, and silicon oils.
