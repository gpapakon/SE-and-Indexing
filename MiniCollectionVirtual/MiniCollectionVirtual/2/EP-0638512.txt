<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a carrying device to be coupled to a vertically 
adjustable support of a fork-lift truck or the like for picking up two 

containers placed one on top of the other. Coupling means (16-23) arranged 
in pairs, one above the other, which are pivotally connected to the frame 

(8) of the carrying device, are disposed in such a manner that an insert end 
(21) of each pair of coupling means can be inserted into a coupling piece 

(4) which is provided near the upper side of the lower of the two containers 
placed one on top of the other, and that an insert end (25) of the other 

coupling means of the pair in question can be inserted into a coupling piece 
(4') which is located near the aforesaid coupling piece (4) of the lower 

container and which is provided at the bottom side of the upper of the two 
containers placed one on top of the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a carrying device to be coupled 
to an adjustable support of a fork-lift truck or the like for picking up 
two containers placed one on top of the other, said containers near their 
corner points being provided with coupling pieces, which have openings 
into which coupling means connected to the frame of the carrying device 
can be inserted, said coupling means being arranged in pairs, in such a 
manner that an insert end of each pair of coupling means can be inserted 
into a coupling piece which is provided near the upper side of the lower 
of the two containers placed one on top of the other, and that an insert 
end of the other coupling means of the pair in question can be inserted 
into a coupling piece which is located near the aforesaid coupling piece 
of the lower container and which is provided at the bottom side of the 
upper of the two containers placed one on top of the other. In order to obtain a good understanding of the problems 
underlying the present invention the known state of the art will be 
explained first with reference to the accompanying Figures 1 - 6, wherein: 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a 
conventional container. Figure 2 is a diagrammatic side view of a part of a 
frame of a carrying device with a container coupled thereto, with a first 
embodiment of a coupling means for coupling the container to the frame 
of the carrying device. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a second 
embodiment of a coupling means. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic illustration of a third 
embodiment of means for coupling a container to a frame of the carrying 
device. Figure 5 is a diagrammatic plan view of a part of a 
frame of a carrying device comprising a further embodiment of coupling 
means. Figure 6 is a diagrammatic sectional view of coupling 
pieces located one above the other of two containers placed one on top 
of the other, in combination with the frame shown in Figure 5. As is shown in Figure 1, a conventional parallelepiped 
container 1 has two side surfaces 2 extending parallel to each other, two 
end surfaces 2' extending perpendicularly to said side surfaces 2, an upper 
surface 3 and a bottom surface (not shown in Figure 1) extending parallel 
to said upper surface 3. Generally the length of a side surface 2 is 
greater than the width of an end surface 2'. Furthermore coupling pieces 
4 are conventionally provided in the corner points of the container, said 
coupling pieces in three surfaces extending perpendicularly to each other 
being
