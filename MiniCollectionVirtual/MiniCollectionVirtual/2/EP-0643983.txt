<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a device for generating an 
adjustable an resisting force for body building machines, 

characterised by a lever pivoted by means of horizontal 
pins to the supporting structure of the machine, the same 

being fitted with a sliding and arrestable mass along the 
lever, one of whose ends is fitted with attachments for the 

mechanical devices used to transmit the muscular force that 
the athlete transmits on the handles or the foot board of 

the machine, to the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application concerns a device for body 
building machines that generates an adjustable resisting 
force on the same. It has today become very common to use body building 
machines for physical fitness training. Although the 
structure and operation of these machines may be different, 
they are all characterised by a power unit that generates 
an adjustable resisting load that the athlete must balance 
with the power of his own muscles. In the great majority of cases, this power unit consists of 
a series of metal prismatic blocks, generally called 
"weights", housed and sliding along two upright bars having 
a circular cross-section, that traverse the entire pile of 
weights at two symmetrically opposite points with respect 
to the barycentre of each weight. The weight selecting device generally consists of a 
vertical bar subject to the direct or indirect lifting 
force applied by the athlete, which is fitted into the hole  
 
at the centre of each weight; said bar being characterised 
by a series of transverse through holes having equidistant 
horizontal axes in which the plug for selecting the weight 
is fitted. In other words, the body builder may select the number of 
weights to lift, according to physical effort he wants to 
exert, simply by sliding the plug into one of the holes of 
the above vertical bars; naturally the lower the hole 
selected, the greater will be the number of weights to be 
lifted. In the more modern machines, the power unit consists of one 
or more pneumatic jacks on whose piston the muscular force 
of the athlete is unloaded, generally by means of lever 
mechanisms; in this type of machine the resistance created 
by the piston may be adjusted by varying the air pressure 
in the jack. The purpose of this invention is to design a new device for 
generating an adjustable resisting force for body building 
machines. The device according to the invention consists of a lever 
on which a sliding mass is fitted, whose weight generates, 
with respect to the pivoting point of the lever, a moment 
of resistance whose force is directly proportional to the 
distance between the pivot and the barycentre of the mass. One of the two ends of said lever being fitted with 
attachments for the mechanical devices (such as cables, 
chains or levers) generally used to transmit the muscular  
 
force that the athlete exerts on the handles or foot board 
of the machine, to the power unit. The device according to the invention is fundamentally 
characterised by a lever, having a fixed

<CLAIMS>
1) A device for generating an adjustable resisting force 
for body building machines characterised by a lever pivoted 

by means of horizontal pins to the supporting frame of the 
machine, the same being fitted with a sliding and 

arrestable mass along the lever, one of whose ends is 
fitted with attachments for the mechanical devices used to 

transmit the muscular force that the athlete transmits on 
the handles or the foot board of the machine, to the lever. 
2) A device for generating an adjustable resisting force 
for body building machines, according to the previous 

claim, characterised in its preferred embodiment, by a 
lever (1) consisting of a parallel pair of longitudinal 

bars (1a) joined by means of transverse bridges (1b) and 
supporting at the bottom two circular supporting and guide 

bars (5) for a cylindrical drum (6) fitted with two 
opposing support couplings (6a) fitted and sliding on the 

above bars (5); the drum (6) being made to slide by means 
of an actuator fixed externally to an anchoring plate (8) 

fixed over the back of the pair of bars (1a). 
3) A device for generating an adjustable resisting force 
for body building machines, according to the previous 

claims, characterised in that the drum (6) actuator 
consists of an electrical motor (7) having relevant 

reduction gear that rotates a threaded shaft (9) fitted 
into the drum (6) with which this shaft is coupled 

helicoidally. 
4) A device for generating an adjustable resisting force 
for body building machines, according to claims 1 and 2, 

characterised in that the drum (6) actuator consists of a 
pneumatic jack.
