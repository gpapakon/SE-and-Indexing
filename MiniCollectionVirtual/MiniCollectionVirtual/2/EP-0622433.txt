<ABSTRACT>
A composition, particularly suitable for use as a one-part aqueous 
laminating construction adhesive composition, comprising an adhesive 

copolymer consisting essentially of a vinyl ester/ethylene copolymer 

comprising a copolymerized carboxylic acid monomer, said vinyl 
ester/ethylene copolymer having a glass transition temperature from 0°C to 

about - 15°C, wherein said copolymerized carboxylic acid is neutralized with 
from 1% to 10% of a nonvolatile base, by weight based on said vinyl 

ester/ethylene copolymer weight. 
A method for producing the composition is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laminating construction adhesive compositions 
with improved performance. Major portions of the laminating adhesives industry such as, for example, the 
construction adhesives industry require a laminating adhesive to permanently 
bond films and foils including plastic films such as, for example, plasticized 
polyvinyl chloride films and cellulosic foils such as, for example, decorative 
(printed) paper foils to construction substrates. Construction substrates include 
porous substrates such as, for example, particle board, plywood, hardboard, 
pressboard, chipboard, fiberboard, and strandboard. Present adhesives cannot achieve a useful balance of high temperature and 
ambient temperature property performance in a one-part adhesive composition. 
In a one-part adhesive composition, a relatively hard copolymer will deliver 
adequate high temperature performance; however, ambient temperature 
performance may be inadequate. Adding a plasticizer to a relatively hard 
copolymer improves the ambient temperature adhesive performance but only 
with attrition in high temperature adhesive performance. One solution to this problem is to employ a two-part adhesive composition in 
which at least one reactive copolymer is mixed with a second reactive agent, 
which may be low in molecular weight or polymeric. Such two-part systems are 
problematic in terms of handling, expense, and stability of the admixed 
composition. US-A-4,694,056 discloses an aqueous pressure sensitive adhesive containing a 
copolymer of an alkyl acrylate or vinyl ester, or both, an acid functional 
comonomer, and a polyfunctional copolymerizable monomer.  
 US-A-5,100,944 discloses a water-borne packaging and converting adhesive which 
contains 10-98 parts dispersion of a vinyl acetate homo-/co-/ter-polymer, 2-30 
parts by weight of plasticizer, and 1-20 parts by weight of ethylene glycol diacetate 
(EGDA) as the sole organic solvent. US-A-4,540,739 discloses aqueous based 
pressure sensitive adhesives which incorporate a latex which contains from 
about 0.5 to about 40 weight percent of a C3-9 ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic 
acid, the latex having been neutralized to a pH of equal to or greater than about 6 
with an alkali metal hydroxide or salt. The present invention seeks to overcome the problems associated with the prior 
art. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a composition, 
particularly suitable for use as a one-part aqueous laminating construction 
adhesive composition,
