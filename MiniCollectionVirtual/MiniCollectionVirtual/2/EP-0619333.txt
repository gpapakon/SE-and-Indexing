<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for coating metals, preferably copper or copper alloys, in particular for the production of circuit boards, in which the surfaces to be coated are brought into contact with a solution containing a monomeric nitrogen compound or a mixture of these compounds, and a surface compound is formed on the metal by electrochemical reaction.

Method of coating metals, wherein the surface to be
coated is brought into contact with a solution containing

a monomeric nitrogen compound, selected from the group of
compounds imidazole, benzimidazole, triazole,

benzotriazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole,
benzothiazole, indole, adenine, purine, chinoline,

pyrazine, chinazoline, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine,
indazole, creatinine, phenazine and derivatives thereof, as

well as cupferron and benzamidine, or mixtures of these
compounds, and a surface compound is formed on the metal by

electrochemical reaction.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the metal ions required for forming the surface layer are

produced wholly or partially by anodic dissolution.
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that an electric voltage between the

surface to be coated and a second electrode, which is to be
immersed in a bath with the solution containing the

monomeric nitrogen compounds, is applied or set at least
temporarily, so that an electric current flows between the

surface to be coated and the second electrode.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the voltage is set in such a manner

that the surface to be coated is polarised as the anode,
and the second electrode is polarised as the cathode.
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the metal surface to be coated is

brought into electrical contact with the second metal
surface in the solution containing the monomeric nitrogen

compounds, the type of metal for the second metal surface
being adapted to the type of metal for the metal surface to 

be coated in such a manner that the metal for the surface
to be coated is less noble than the metal for the second

metal surface.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5 for use in
printed circuit board technology.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6 for
producing layers which are employed as etching resist.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the coating is completely removed

from the metal surface by a treatment in acidic aqueous
solution.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised by the following process steps:


(a) producing a negative image on a printed circuit
board with an akalinely removable resist on at least one

side of the printed circuit board;
(b) immersing the printed circuit board in an acidic
solution containing the monomeric nitrogen compounds, an

electric voltage being applied at least temporarily between
the metal surfaces of the printed circuit board and a

second electrode, which is immersed in the solution
containing the monomeric nitrogen compounds and polarised

as the cathode relative to the printed circuit board, or
said electrode being automatically set because of the type

of the metals;
(c) if necessary, rinsing-off the excess solution;
(d) if necessary, drying or tempering the printed
circuit board;
(e) selectively removing the akalinely removable resist
from the printed circuit board surface by immersion in an

alkaline solution, so that the copper faces situated
therebelow are exposed; and 
(f) removing the exposed copper faces by an alkaline
etching process.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the monomeric nitrogen compounds

selected are those which are soluble in acidic aqueous
solution and insoluble in alkaline aqueous solution.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that cyclic compounds, which are

substituted with an unbranched, linear or branched alkyl
chain having at least three carbon atoms and/or having an

aromatic residue are employed as monomeric nitrogen
compounds directly or via alkyl c
hains and/or with amino
groups directly or via alkyl chains.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the monomeric nitrogen compounds are

used in a concentration of between 0.001 g/l solution and
400 g/l solution.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that solubilising alcohols, organic and/or

inorganic acids, additions for pH stabilising purposes, or
respectively aliphatic amines, are also added to the

solution containing the monomeric nitrogen compounds.
