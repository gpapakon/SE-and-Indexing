<DESCRIPTION>
SURFACTANTT is invention relates to a surfactant, a method of making it, a dispersion containing the surfactant and a dispersed sol id, a polymer composition that comprises the surfactant and a plasticiser, a method for making the dispersion, a dispersible sol id comprising the surfactant, and a product coated with material comprising the discontinuous phase of the dispersion.According to a first aspect of the invention, a surfactant is characterised by a plural ity of add i i on-copo I y er chains, on each chain an average of at least 0.5 adsorptive or chemi sorpt i ve groups and at least one monovalent polyether residue; and between the chains at least one divalent polyether residue.The terms "adsorptive" and "chemisorpt i ve" herein indicate that the chains of the surfactant are capable of adsorption or che i sorpt i on to the surface of a phase other than that which is or comprises the surfactant.The balance of the relative proportions of the chains and the residue is such that the surfactant has sufficient solubi l ity as such or as a salt in a l iquid to exert surface activity, either in that I i qu i d or on the surface of a sol id to which it is appl ied by way of such a solution. Whereas it is bel ieved that the surfactant is mainly a two-dimensional molecule, it may be at least partly three-dimensional , provided that it has sufficient solubi l ity.A particular embodiment of the surfactant of the present invention is characterised by the fol lowing features:(a) a plural ity n of add i t i on—copo I ymer chains;(b) on at least n-2 chains, at least one, especial ly 3-10, optional ly sal ified carboxyl ic acid groups and at least two carboxyi ic ester groups;(c) at least one, especial ly 2—6 of the carbox i ic ester groups in each chain having as its alcohol residue a monovalent polyether residue; and 

Cd) at least one other of the carboxyi ic ester groups in each chain having as its alcohol residue a divalent polyether residue, a further end of which is the alcohol residue of the carboxyi ic ester group of another of said addi t ion—copo I ymer chains; and (e) optional ly a carbox i ic ester group having as its alcohol residue a monovalent hybrocarby I residue, e.g.Cι-20 hydrocarby I .The add i ion—copo I ymer chains may consist of (i) carboxy I —carry i ng uni s present as acid or ester in features (b) - (d) and (ϊϊ) other units.The carboxy I -carryi ng units may be for example Cmeth)acr I i c units, but are preferably 1 ,2—d ϊcarboxy I i c units such as ma I eic units.
