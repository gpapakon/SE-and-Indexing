<ABSTRACT>
The stencil printing device of the present 
invention comprises a mixing unit (63) for receiving the 

first liquid from the first liquid storage container 
and the second liquid from the second liquid storage 

container, and producing printing ink by mixing the two 
liquids, a printing ink supply passage (49) for conducting 

the printing ink produced by the mixing unit to an ink 
squeegee unit (47) of a printing drum, ink amount sensor (57) for 

detecting the amount of the printing ink in the ink 
squeegee unit, and ink supply control unit (89) for 

controlling the amount of the printing ink that is 
supplied from the mixing unit to the ink squeegee unit 

according to the amount of printing ink detected by the 
ink amount sensor. Thus, a relatively large number of 

prints can be made with each bottle of printing ink so 
that the frequency of replacing the ink bottle may be 

reduced. Additionally, stable stencil printing can be 
carried out by receiving printing ink having prescribed 

consistency and other desirable properties irrespective 
of the age of the printing ink or the surrounding 

temperature without requiring any human intervention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil printing 
device, and in particular to a stencil printing device for 
carrying out stencil printing by using a printing ink 
consisting of a mixture of a first liquid and a second liquid. It is known that the conventional ink supply control 
device for a stencil machine as disclosed in DE-A-4,215,923 
controls the supply of an ink reservoir provided in a printing 
drum, but the printing ink used in stencil printing devices in 
most cases consists of W/O type emulsion ink having an 
appropriate consistency. Such a printing ink is typically 
produced in a factory by mixing and emulsifying oil and water 
containing dye (pigment) by using a mixer, and is commercially 
available in ink bottles. Since the effective part of the 
printing ink is limited to the oil component of such an 
emulsified ink, a bottle of printing ink tends to be consumed 
by printing a limited number of prints, and it is necessary to 
replace the ink bottle more often than desired. It is known that emulsion printing ink tends to undergo 
some changes in its property and to separate into oil and 
water in time. Printing ink which has separated into oil and 
water and is thus made uneven in its properties loses its 
original consistency (viscosity), and may lose its suitability 
as printing ink for stencil printing. Therefore, there is a 
certain service life in the emulsion printing ink packaged in 
an ink container. Furthermore, most printing inks for stencil printing such 
as emulsion inks and oil inks are subjected to changes in 
their consistency depending on the surrounding temperature, 
and it is necessary to adjust the contents of the printing ink 
depending on the season of the year for keeping the 
consistency or  
 
viscosity at an appropriate level irrespective of the 
surrounding temperature. In view of such problems of the prior art, a primary 
object of the present invention is to provide a stencil 
printing device which allows relatively large number of prints 
to be made with each bottle of printing ink so that the 
frequency of replacing the ink bottle may be reduced. A second object of the present invention is to provide a 
stencil printing device which allows stable stencil printing 
to be carried out by receiving printing ink having prescribed 
consistency and other desirable properties irrespective of the 
age of the printing ink or the surrounding temperature. A third object of the present invention is to provide a 
stencil printing device which allows uniform print
