<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the invention, apparatus for cleaving optical fiber 
utilizes a pair of displaceable clamping surfaces to rotate the fiber about its axis 

before the cleaving step. Specifically, the apparatus comprises first holding means 
for securing the fiber against rotation at a first longitudinal position, a pair of 

displaceable clamping surfaces for clamping the fiber at a second position, and 
means for relatively displacing the surfaces to rotate the fiber. Cleaving means 

applied to the fiber between the first and second position effects cleavage with a 
tilted endface substantially free of subsurface damage and contaminants. A 

significant advantage of this apparatus is that it can angle cleave a single fiber or 
simultaneously cleave a plurality of fibers in a multi-fiber ribbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for cleaving optical fiber and, in 
particular, to improved apparatus for cleaving fiber to produce a tilted (angled) 
endface suitable for low reflection optical joints. As high performance optical fiber communications systems are 
increasingly deployed, methods and apparatus for interconnecting fibers and for 
connecting fibers to optoelectronic devices assume increasing practical importance. 
For example, it is important to be able to cleave an optical fiber in such a fashion that 
the endface is tilted with respect to the fiber axis at an angle in excess of about 5° 
and is relatively free of subsurface damage and contamination. A tilted endface is 
needed in order to redirect reflected light that would otherwise be reflected back to 
the source. Joints made with tilted endface fibers can direct reflected light out of the 
transmission path. At the same time the tilted endfaces must be free of subsurface 
damage and contaminants to avoid deterioration of the optical signal being 
transmitted. A useful approach to cleaving fiber and making such non-reflecting 
joints is disclosed in applicants' United States Patent No. 5,048,908 issued 
September 17, 1991. The '908 patent discloses that tilted optical fiber endfaces 
useful in low-reflection optical fiber joints can be produced by cleaving, provided the 
fiber is rotated through an appropriate twist angle. The '908 patent describes apparatus for such cleaving comprising 
holding means for clamping the fiber, a collet for rotatably holding the fiber, and 
second holding means for clamping the fiber in position and optionally applying a 
tensile force in the range 50-300 grams. After the fiber is rotated, a conventional 
cleaving tool is brought into contact with the fiber producing the desired tilted 
endface. The '908 apparatus is well suited for cleaving a single fiber. However, 
since the '908 invention, multi-fiber ribbon consisting of two or more closely-spaced 
fibers is being used in an increasing number of applications. It would be difficult 
and tedious to use the '908 apparatus one-by-one with the individual strands of a 
multi-fiber ribbon. Accordingly, there is a need for improved apparatus for angle 
cleaving one or more optical fibers.  Apparatus for cleaving optical fiber utilizes a pair of displaceable 
clamping surfaces to rotate the fiber about its axis before the cleaving step. 
Specifically, the apparatus comprises first holding means for securing the fiber 
against rotation at a first
