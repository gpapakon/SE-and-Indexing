<ABSTRACT>
A veterinary composition in form of sustained release 
microcapsules containing erythromycin thiocyanate as 

active ingredient is disclosed, said composition being 
suitable for preventing and/or treating diarrhea or 

abortion, infections caused by gram-positive cocci and 
rods, anaerobic infections, rickettsial and chalamydial 

infections, mycoplasma infections and particularly swine 
dysentery. In the use, said composition is mixed with 

standard feedstuff in a ratio of 100/200 g per 100 kg 
(quintal) feedstuff. A process for preparing said 

composition is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a veterinary
composition in microencapsulated form useful for
preventing and/or treating diarrhea or abortion,
infections caused by gram-positive cocci and rods,
anaerobic infections, rickettsial and chlamydial
infections, and mycoplasma infections. More particularly
it relates to a composition in form of sustained release
microcapsules to treat and prevent swine dysentery and
containing erythromycin thiocyanate as active ingredient
as well as a feedstuff containing said composition and a
process for preparing the same.It is known that with swine dysentery a common,
important mucohemorrhagic diarrheal and exudative
disease is meant, which occurs in most swine-producing
countries. A spirochete, Treponema hyodysenteriae, is
the only agent involved in the transmission of swine
dysentery, but other anaerobic bacteria that are
normally present in the colon of pigs are necessary in
addition to T. hyodysenteriae to produce the disease in
gnotobiotic pigs.The disease is transmitted by ingestion of fecal
material from affected or clinically normal swine
carrying T. hyodysenteriae. New outbreaks in herds from
which the disease was previously absent usually follow
the introduction of new stock. Once the disease has
entered a herd, it usually spreads slowly at first,
requiring close contact between pigs or the movement of
relatively large amounts of infective feces. It may take
several weeks or months to build up to a high morbidity.
It remains permanently endemic and is difficult to
eradicate.Any age of pig is susceptible but the incidence is 
highest between 15 and 17 kg. The incubation period is
usually 7 to 14 days, but it may be considerably longer.
In field cases the death losses in weanling pigs may be
as high as 30% and the morbidity over 90% but in most
cases the mortality is low and the morbidity about 25 to
50%.The first evidence of the disease in most herds is the
appearance of yellow-to-gray, soft feces combined with a
slight reduction in appetite. As the disease progresses
the feces may become watery, contain blood, mucus and a
whitish mucofibrinous exudate, with staining of the
perineal region; this leads to dehydration, weakness,
emaciation, rough coat, incoordination and creased
thirst. The body temperature may rise however this is
not consistent. The diffuse lesions are confined to the
cecum, spiral colon, and rectum. In early stages, the
affected mucosa is covered with a layer of transparent
or gray mucus, often with suspended flecks of blood.
