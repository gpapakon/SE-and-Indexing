<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an information processing apparatus capable of storing therein 
modifier information such as an underline, a correction of contents, etc. with respect to 

fixed and stored information. A microcomputer (12) effects processing corresponding 
to an input and outputs information indicative of the result of processing therefrom. An 

optical magnetic recording and reproducing device (8) records the information 
indicative of the result of processing, which has been outputted from the 

microcomputer, on a read/write area of a hybrid disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
processing apparatus in the technical
field of a portable personal data base, for example.As a conventional information processing
apparatus, there is known one having a structure shown
in FIG. 21. In FIG. 21, a CPU 54 controls operations of
respective components. A keyboard 50 inputs indications
for operations to be executed by a user. A ROM 56 has
programs stored therein, for causing the CPU 54 to
effect operations corresponding to the indications for
the operations. A RAM 58 is used as a work area at the
time of execution of the programs. An input/output
interface 60 effects the transfer of various data
between an external peripheral device and the CPU 54.
The CPU 54, the ROM 56, the RAM 58 and the input/output
interface 60 constructs a microcomputer 52.A CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read Only Memory) type
reader (CD-ROM drive) 66 reads data recorded on a CD-ROM
medium in response to an instruction or indication 
issued from the CPU 54 and transfers it to the CPU 54.
An LCD driver 62 serves so as to display display data
outputted from the CPU 54 on an LCD 64 and displays the
data read from the CD-ROM drive 66 thereon. A CD-ROM
read from the CD-ROM drive is normally of a data base
including various information such as characters,
graphic forms, voices, etc.Since the CD-ROM has been used as the recording
medium for the data base, new information cannot be
written into the recording medium. Accordingly, the
aforementioned conventional information processing
apparatus are accompanied by the following problems.
1. A function for recording handwritings or
holographs equivalent or corresponding to an
┌underline┘ made by a red pen or the like, a ┌mark┘
made by a marker pen, etc., and symbols, both of which
have been represented on a normal paper medium, cannot
not be realized. Further, the holographs and the
symbols cannot not be stored so as to correspond to the
contents of the data base.2. Even if the above ┌underline┘ and ┌mark┘
are temporarily stored within the RAM used as the work
area, information about the ┌underline┘ and ┌mark┘ is
normally erased simultaneously with the ejection of the 
CD-ROM, thus causing inconvenience that the
┌underline┘ and the ┌mark┘ are not left behind as
they are even if the CD-ROM is loaded into the
information processing apparatus again.3. The following A, B and C cannot be effected
on the data base:
A. Modification of contentsB. Change in outward appearance at the time of
visual representation
   (change in font size, color, style of

<CLAIMS>
An information processing apparatus comprising:

inputting means (10,30) for inputting of information from an operator by handwriting;
processing means (12) for effecting processing on the handwritten information input
by the operator and for outputting holograph information corresponding to the

handwritten information; and
recording and reproducing means (8) for recording information on and reproducing
the information from a disc recording medium (804) having a read-only area with

predetermined information recorded thereon in advance and a read/write area for
storing therein the holograph information.
An information processing apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, further comprising
displaying means (24) for displaying the information indicative of said result of

processing thereon.
An information processing apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said inputting
means (10) outputs modifier information with respect to the information recorded on the

read-only area of said disc recording medium (804) to said processing means.
