<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to indene derivatives and 
antimicrobial agents containing such indene derivatives 
as active components. It has been known that etiolated Adlay (species of Job's 
tears, Coix lachryma-Jobi) seedlings have antimicrobial 
activities, whether in a dried form, as a squeezed juice 
or as an extract. As examples of compound having this 
kind of antimicrobial activity, Japanese Patent 
Publications Tokkai 2-270825 and 3-240473 have suggested 
monoglycerides of stearic acid and palmitic acid, as 
well as their derivatives. It is an object of the present invention to provide new 
indene derivatives which are isolated from etiolated 
seedlings of Adlay and show superior antimicrobial 
activities. The present inventors have discovered, as a result of 
their diligent investigations into the antimicrobial 
activities exhibited by etiolated Adlay seedlings in a 
dried form, as a squeezed juice or as an extract, that 
new indene derivatives can be isolated if etiolated  
 
Adlay seedlings are processed in a certain specified 
manner. This invention relates to new indene derivatives shown 
by Formulae (1) and (2) shown below, as well as 
antimicrobial agents containing such indene derivatives 
as their active component: 
A process for obtaining the indene derivatives as shown 
by Formulas (1) and (2) is described next. First, 
etiolated Adlay seedlings are obtained by causing Adlay 
seeds to germinate in a dark environment, as will be 
described in detail below by way of examples. Examples 
of Adlay which may be used according to the present 
invention include local varieties such as Tokuda, 
Nakazato, Okayama and Kuroishi, but the invention is not 
limited by the use of any particular kind. As for the 
process itself, use may be made of any usual method of 
obtaining etiolated seedlings by germinating in the 
dark. For example, Adlay seeds may be germinated in the 
dark for 4-8 days at 25Â°C. Nearly the entirety of 
etiolated seedlings of Adlay thus obtained can be used 
for the purpose of this invention. Next, the etiolated Adlay seedlings thus obtained, or 
what may be obtained therefrom by grinding, 
freeze-drying or pulverizing, are subjected to an 
extraction process by using a lower alkanol e.g. 
methanol or ethanol. Next, the extract thus obtained is 
subjected to a liquid-liquid partition extraction 
process by using a combination of methanol or ethanol 
and chloroform. After a chloroform layer is separated, 
another liquid-liquid partition process is carried out 
by using a combination

An indene derivative shown by Formula (1) given 
below: 


An indene derivative shown by Formula (2) given 
below: 


An antimicrobial agent having the indene derivative 
of claim 1 or claim 2 as an active component.  

 
A method of isolating indene derivatives of claim 1 
and claim 2, said method comprising the steps of: 


obtaining an extract from etiolated Adlay 
seedlings; 
subjecting said extract to a first liquid-liquid 
partition extraction process and thereafter separating a 

liquid layer to obtain a residue; 
subjecting said residue to a second liquid-liquid 
partition extraction process to thereby obtain a simple 

lipid; and 
subjecting said simple lipid to repeated 
chromatographic separation processes to thereby separate 

compounds by different retention times thereof. 
The method of claim 4 wherein said etiolated Adlay 
seedlings are ground, freeze-dried or pulverized. 
The method of claim 4 or claim 5, wherein said 
first liquid-liquid partition extraction process is 

carried out by using either a combination of methanol 
and chloroform or a combination of ethanol and 

chloroform, and said liquid layer comprises chloroform. 
The method of claim 6 wherein said second 
liquid-liquid partition extraction process is carried  

 
out by using a combination of separated chloroform from 

said liquid layer and acetone and said acetone is 
removed after said liquid-liquid partition extraction 

process. 
The method of any of claims 4 to 7, wherein said 
chromatographical separation processes are carried out 

at least in part by chromatography using mobile phases 
with polarities. 
The method of any of claims 4 to 7 wherein said 
chromatographic separation processes are carried out by 

a combination of gel permeation chromatography and HPLC 
by using mobile phases with different polarities.
