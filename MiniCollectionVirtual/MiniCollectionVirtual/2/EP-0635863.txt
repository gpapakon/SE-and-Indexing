<ABSTRACT>
A deformation produced by heat when a G1 grid is welded can be 
suppressed. A U-shaped slit (34) is formed on an outer peripheral wall 

(31) of a G1 grid (12). A spot-welding portion (X) is set to an end 
edge of a joint portion of the U-shaped slit (34) and this spot-welding 

portion (X) is spot-welded to a retainer (22) of a cathode (21) by a 
laser beam. In the G1 grid (12), the deformation produced by heat upon 

welding is absorbed by the surrounding portions of the slit (34). 
Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the opposing surface opposing 

a G2 grid (13) from being expanded by heat. Thus, the spacing between 
the electrodes can be maintained to be a proper one and the angles of 

the electron beam emitting apertures can be maintained at proper ones. 
Therefore, it becomes possible to prevent the characteristic of the 

electron gun and the resolution of the cathode ray tube from being 
deteriorated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electron gun for use with a cathode
ray tube.Heretofore, in a cathode ray tube (CRT), three electron beams E
are emitted from a unipotential electron gun 10, shown in FIG. 1 of the
accompanying drawings, for example, to impinge on a three-primary color
phosphor screen formed on the surface of the cathode ray tube to
display a predetermined color. FIG. 1 shows an example of such
conventional unipotential electron gun 10. Because the three-primary
color phosphor screen is divided to provide very small phosphor screen
parts, if the electron beams E are not impinged upon the phosphor
screen at the precise positions, a mis-registration occurs so that a
color is not displayed correctly. Therefore, the three electron beams
E should be accurately emitted from predetermined positions of the
electron gun 10.As shown in FIG. 1, the electron gun 10 comprises a support pin
11, a G1 grid (first grid) 12 through G5 grid (fifth grid) 17 and a
convergence plate (deflection plate) 18. The respective assembly parts
11 through 18 are spaced apart with proper spacings. Long glass
beadings 20 are secured to pins 19 projected from respective side
walls, whereby the respective assembly parts 11 through 18 are properly
positioned and then fixed with predetermined spacings.In order to accurately emit the electron beams E from the
predetermined positions of the electron gun 10, the respective grids 12
to 17 should be assembled with a highly accurate relative positional
relationship.The G1 grid 12 houses therein a cathode 21 as shown in FIG. 2.
The cathode 21 has a retainer 22 fitted into a very small clearance
produced between it and an outer peripheral wall 31 of the G1 grid 12.
The outer peripheral wall 31 of the G1 grid 12 is spot-welded at its
four spot-welding points X to the retainer 22 by some suitable welding
means, such as laser beam or the like, as shown in FIGS. 3A, 3B.A ceramic disk 23 (see FIG. 2) is fitted and secured into the
retainer 22. The ceramic disk 23 includes thereon three cathode
sleeves 24 for emitting the electron beams E and three guide pins 25
for supporting the cathode sleeves 24. Each of the cathode sleeves 24 
is fixed to the guide pin 25 by means of a V-tab having a V-letter wire
(not shown).In the conventional electron gun 10, the outer peripheral portion
31 of the G1 grid 12 is spot-welded to the retainer 22 by a laser beam
and the surrounding portion of the spot-welding portion is heated by a
large quantity of heat generated upon spot-welding so that an opposing
