<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved IR 
transmitting fibers and, more particularly, to the use of oxide 
and heavy-metal containing glass fibers for coupling with a 
mid-infrared laser for medical laser surgical applications. Laser microsurgery and coronary angioplasty require 
precise removal of tissue without thermally damaging the 
surrounding tissues. Such medical/surgical lasers require 
using a wavelength in the mid-infrared wavelength region, i.e. 
between about 1.0 and 3.0 µm (microns), which is the wavelength 
range most strongly absorbed by animal tissue. As the 2.94 µm 
(micron) wavelength of the Er:Yag laser is the most well-absorbed 
by animal tissue and the tissue absorption coefficient (α = 
1000cm-1) is the highest with the Er:Yag laser, this laser is 
preferred for many surgical procedures (see "Laser Evolution", 
Nov. 1991). To efficiently use the power delivered by the 
Er:Yag laser, a ruggedized infrared (IR) optical fiber which 
transmits at 2.94 µm (microns) must be used. Coupled to the output 
of the laser beam, the IR fiber can deliver the power to ablate 
tissues. Infrared transmitting zirconium fluoride based 
glasses such as ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF-PbF2 (see Esterowitz et 
al, "Angioplasty With a Laser and Fiber Optics at 2-94µm") have 
emerged as the materials of choice for the IR transmitting 
fiber because their optical transmission between 2.5 µm (microns) to 
5.0 µm (microns) exceeds 90 percent, as shown in Fig. 1. Similarly, 
fluoride glass fibers exhibit optical losses as low as 0.06 
dB/m at 2.94 µm (microns). This is equivalent to a transmission of 
over 90 per cent in a 30.5 cm long fiber. A flexible fiber 
hand-piece with a minimum length of about 15.24 cm and a 
desirable length of 30.5 cm or greater can be made adaptable to 
many laser delivery systems.  
 However, the zirconium fluoride based glass fibers 
have a drawback in that they are capable of carrying only very 
low power. Investigations recently carried out have shown the 
following: a 300 µm (micron) core fluoride glass fiber, when 
coupled to an Er:Yag laser operating with an output power of 
180 mJ at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, could transmit around 135 
mJ or 1.35 watts but failed after only two minutes. As the 
laser output power increased, the fiber damage occurred much 
faster. Fiber damage always occurred at the fiber input end 
face or along the fiber length resulting in a localized melt-down 
of the glass followed by power rupture. As a result, 
zirconium fluoride based glass fibers have
