<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel thermolysin-like
neutral metallo-proteases and to use thereof, more
specifically in the production of benzyloxycarbonyl-α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine
methyl ester.Thermolysin is a useful enzyme which is commercially
available and used in a wide variety of fields, for example
in detergent compositions, in food processing and in cosmetic
formulations. It is further used in the synthesis of
benzyloxycarbonyl-α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester
(hereinafter referred to briefly as Z-APM), which is a
precursor of aspartame, an artificial sweetener.Thermolysin was first found in the culture broth of
Bacillusthermoproteolyticus (Endo, S. (1962) J. Fermentation
Tech., 40, 346-353) and a number of investigations have been
conducted thereon. Thus, for instance, its amino acid
sequence (Titani, K., et al., (1972) Nature New Biol., 238,
35-37) and the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme
(Holmes, M.A. and Matthews, B.W., (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 160.,
623-639) have been elucidated. Meanwhile, the protease gene
was cloned from Bacillusthermoproteolyticus (EP-A-0418625)
and the amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme as deduced
frcm the nucleotide sequence of said gene was found to be 
different from the original primary structure as indicated by
Titani in two positions. Thus, it was reported that the 37th
(from the amino terminal) amino acid residue of the mature
enzyme is not aspartic acid but asparagine and the 119th one
is not glutamic acid but glutamine. This amino acid sequence
is identical with that coded by nprM, one of the protease
genes cloned from Bacillusstearothermophilus (Kubo, M., et
al., (1988) Journal of General Microbiology 134, 1883-1892).Therefore, in the present specification, the
protease coded by this nprM gene or the gene from Bacillus
thermoproteolyticus is referred to as "wild type thermolysin-like
neutral metallo-protease".Alteration of specific activity and stability of
thermolysin-like neutral metallo-protease has very recently
been reported (Kubo M., et al., (1992) Applied and
Environmental Microbiology, 58, 3779-3783). In this article
various mutants have been described which differ in one or
more amino acid residues in the primary structure, especially
at positions 93, 110, 114, 115, 136, 137, 143, 151, 157, 193,
211, 217 and 221. But in this reference, the activity was
measured only by casein digestion method. None of these
mutants, however, did show any substantially improved activity
in relation to Z-APM synthesis or digestion. It now (as
