<ABSTRACT>
A system for associating application or system information with 
data files according to data file attributes. The system employs an 

Automatic Classification Selection (ACS) filter (28) having an ordered 
sequence of rule-based declarations, each of which specifies a range of 

values for selected data file attributes. Each rule-based declaration 
includes specifications for data file attributes, any of which can be 

specified using wild-cards. Each data file is tested against the ordered 
declarations and the first declaration that matches the data file 

attributes is enabled to assign a classification to that data file. 
Because the ACS filter is declarative, it may be easily modified without 

programming expertise. Because any data file can be quickly sieved 
through the ACS filter, the data file class linkages need not be stored 

and thus are always dynamically updated in response to changes in data 
file attributes over time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to computer-implemented data 
processing file management systems and, more specifically, to an 
Automatic Class Selection (ACS) system employing a declarative ACS 
filter. Many useful data file storage management techniques are known in 
the art. In particular, file classification schemes for associating 
selected data files to particular storage groups and management classes 
are necessary for the efficient management of large database systems such 
as the Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) Systems Managed Storage (SMS) 
system introduced by International Business Machines Corporation. In the MVS/SMS, data file management includes routines for 
Automatic Class Selection (ACS) based on data file attributes. These ACS 
routines are used to determine the SMS classes and storage groups for 
data sets in a SMS complex. This procedure automates and centralizes the 
determination of SMS classes and storage groups and also facilitates the 
conversion of data files to a SMS environment. Unfortunately, these ACS routines are procedural programming 
language specifications that must be executed to link or assign a 
management or storage class to a data file. The assigned classes are 
then stored in a database for later reference by the SMS system. This 
has several disadvantages. First, there is no provision for 
automatically updating the class assignments in response to changes in 
data file characteristics over time. Secondly, the procedure requires 
both the classification selection step and a database reference step 
which is inefficient. Finally, the ACS routine cannot be modified 
without resorting to programming expertise that may not be available to 
all users. The MVS/SMS ACS routines may be appreciated with reference to 
U.S. Patent 5,018,060., and to MVS/ESA Storage Administration Reference, 
Version 3, Release 1, Chapter 8: "Defining ACS Routines", pp. 59-62, 
International Business Machines Corp. (SC 26-4514), Armonk, NY. Other practitioners have proposed file management systems that 
provide similar data file attribute linking systems. For instance, the 
Personally Safe'n'Sound (PSNS) tool in the Operating System/2 (OS/2) 
Tools Repository provides a rule-based backup system that associates  
 
backup attributes with data files using wild-card specifications for 
directory paths and file names only. Although this provides some 
automation of the data file backup process, it offers no provision to 
accommodate attributes other than name and path or changes in data file

A method for classifying data files in a computer system having 
means for storing a plurality of data files each having one or more file 

attributes, comprising the steps of: 
   establishing at least one Automatic Class Selection (ACS) filter in 

said storage means wherein said ACS filter includes an ordered plurality 
of rule declarations each specifying a range of values for a plurality of 

said file attributes and at least one file management class; 
   testing in sequence each said rule declaration for coincidence with 

the file attributes of a first said data file until identification of the 
first said rule declaration that coincides with said first data file 

attributes; and 
   assigning to said first data file the file management class 

specified in said first coincident rule declaration. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said file attributes include 
a plurality of file identifiers and a plurality of file characteristics 

and wherein each said rule declaration specifies a value for at least one 
of said plurality of file characteristics. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 or 2 wherein said assigning 
step includes the step of: 

storing said assigned file management classification in said storage 
means. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein said 
plurality of file identifiers includes a file name, a file directory and 

a file storage group. 
A method as claimed in any of Claims 2 to 4 wherein said plurality 
of file characteristics includes a file size designation and one or more 

file type designations. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein said 
assigned file management class refers to an executable ACS procedure. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein said 
file attributes include a plurality of file identifiers and a plurality 

of file characteristics and wherein each said rule declaration specifies 
a value for at least one of said plurality of file characteristics.

data file a management class specified in said first coincident rule 
declaration. 
A computer system as claimed in Claim 8 wherein said file
