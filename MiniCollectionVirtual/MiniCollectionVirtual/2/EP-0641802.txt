Method of treating cellulose to activate it for subsequent chemical
reactions by bringing the cellulose into contact with liquid ammonia

under a pressure which is increased with respect to atmospheric pressure
in a pressure vessel and subsequent depressurisation by rapid reduction

of the pressure to atmospheric pressure, wherein

pulp with a content of Î±-cellulose of at least 92% by mass is used,
the ammonia is allowed to act on the pulp at room temperature or
at a temperature higher than room temperature,
after the depressurisation the ammonia still remaining in the
pressure vessel is removed down to a minimum content of 2 to

4% by weight, with respect to the mass of pulp, at which the
activated state achieved by the action of the ammonia is still

retained

and
the remaining ammonia still necessary for the maintenance of the
activated state is finally replaced by another swelling or inclusion

agent.
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that a quantitative ratio 
of ammonia to pulp of 6 mass units of ammonia to 10 mass units of pulp

to 10 mass units of ammonia to 10 mass units of pulp is selected.
Method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the removal of
the ammonia remaining in the pressure vessel after the depressurisation -

down to its minimum content for the maintenance of the activated state -
is effected by suction, pumping away, discharging under pressure or by

warming the content of the pressure vessel to a temperature which
corresponds at least to the room temperature.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
water, steam, superheated steam, an ether, an epoxide, a glycol, a

hydrocarbon, an inert gas or carbon dioxide is used as the other swelling
or inclusion agent.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
the gaseous ammonia escaping during the depressurisation is collected

and recompressed to form liquid ammonia.
