<ABSTRACT>
An electropneumatic converter controlled by solenoid valves (1,4), 
in 

which said solenoid valves (1,4) are connected respectively to the feed 
pressure (3) and to atmosphere (5), each via a pressure regulator (22,27) 

controlled by a differential pressure measurement device (23,28) 
connected 

across the relative solenoid valve (1,4), so as to maintain a constant 
pressure difference across said solenoid valves (1,4); preferred 

embodiments are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electropneumatic converter with 
solenoid valve control which by imposing a constant minimum 
pressure difference across each of the two control solenoid valves 
not only results in an evident considerable reduction in the 
energy required for operating said solenoid valves but also 
results in a substantially linear variation in converter output 
pressure with solenoid valve opening time, independently of feed 
pressure variations and the value of the converter output 
pressure, besides maintaining the dead times of said solenoid 
valves always constant with consequent improvement in control 
precision and repeatability, in particular for small solenoid 
valve opening times. As is well known, the pneumatic actuators of process valves are 
controlled by electropneumatic converters able to modulate their 
output pressure on the basis of electrical command signals. 
Various types of electropneumatic converters are already known in 
the state of the art. In one of said known types, namely the type controlled by solenoid 
valves, a loading solenoid valve connected to the feed pressure 
and an unloading solenoid valve connected to atmosphere regulate  
 
the pressure within a capacitive chamber connected to them in 
series. Said capacitive chamber pressure is then used to control 
a booster unit which is connected to said feed pressure, its 
purpose being to amplify the output flow rate from the converter 
to the extent necessary for controlling the connected actuators. 
Finally, to prevent the large movements of the moving element of 
said booster being able to vary the volume of said capacitive 
chamber with consequent undesirable variation in the pressure of 
this latter, a pressure repeater consisting substantially of a 
separation membrane, a restriction and a nozzle-plate system is 
interposed between said chamber and said booster. Such a known converter has however the serious drawback that the 
output pressure signal does not vary linearly with the actuation 
or opening time of the solenoid valves in that it depends strongly 
on both the feed pressure and the value of the output pressure. 
This dependency means that the solenoid valves have to operate 
several times in order, by successive approximations, to achieve 
the required output pressure, with consequent considerable energy 
consumption. Said drawbacks substantially derive from the fact 
that the pressure difference across the two solenoid valves varies 
depending on the converter operating conditions. This

An electropneumatic converter with solenoid valve control, 
comprising two solenoid valves for loading and respectively 

unloading a capacitive chamber arranged in series with said 
solenoid valves and correspondingly connected by these to the feed 

pressure and to atmosphere, said capacitive chamber being 
connected in series with a pressure repeater consisting 

substantially of a membrane separating said capacitive chamber 
from a repetitive pressure chamber which is connected to the 

feed pressure via a restriction and to atmosphere via a nozzle-plate 
system, the pressure of said repetitive chamber being used 

to control the moving element of a booster unit modulating the 
output chamber pressure by means of a spring-loaded valving member 

connecting said output chamber pressure either to the feed pressure 
in the loading phase or to atmosphere in the unloading phase, characterised in that 

said loading and unloading solenoid valves are connected respectively to the feed 
pressure and to atmosphere each via a pressure regulator 

controlled by a differential pressure measurement device connected 
across the relative solenoid valve such as to maintain the 

pressure difference across said solenoid valve constant. 
An electropneumatic converter with solenoid valve control 
as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said pressure 

regulators and said differential pressure measurement devices for 
said loading and unloading solenoid valves are formed respectively 

by the actual pressure repeater, the repetitive pressure chamber 
of which is connected to the outlet of said unloading solenoid 

valve, in which chamber a spring is made to act on the separation  
 

membrane in the sense of urging it towards the capacitive pressure 
chamber, and by the actual booster, the moving element of which is 

biased by a second spring towards the output chamber which is 
connected to the inlet of the loading solenoid valve. 
An electropneumatic converter with solenoid valve control 
as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 

said second spring is preloaded with the load necessary to obtain 
a pressure difference between the output chamber and the control 

chamber which is double that which the other spring determines 
between the capacitive chamber and the repetitive chamber. 
An electropneumatic converter with solenoid valve control 
as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 

said restriction in the pressure repeater is connected to said 
converter output chamber, feed to the repeater being ensured by 

modulating the said converter feed valving member.
