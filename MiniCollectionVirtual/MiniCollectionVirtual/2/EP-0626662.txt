<ABSTRACT>
In order to solve the problems related to the disclosing of the algorithms for transcoding secret codes into chip cards, especially prepayment-type chip cards, there is provision to limit the possible number of authentifications by the number of prepaid units contained in the card. It is shown that in this case this number, generally small, for example about a hundred units, limits the number of attempts which a fraudster can make to attempt to fathom the mysteries of the secret encipherment algorithm.

<CLAIMS>
A chip card, in particular a telephone card,
provided with a means for limiting the number of

authentications that can be run with this chip and a
means for running an authentication routine consisting in

transcoding a series of bits or random number with the
aid of a secret code received from a chip card reader on

an input of the chip and in transmitting said transcoded
random number back to the reader, said limiting means

comprising:

a register, the number of changes of state of
which is limited, the state thereof being representative

of the degree of usage of the card and changing as the
card is used,
a first cabled logic circuit (10) for authorising
a first authentication to be run when voltage is applied

to the chip or after a reset to zero command, said
pseudo-identification, corresponding to a characteristic

random number, being always the same,
a second cabled logic circuit (15) for detecting
a change of state of the register during usage of the

card,
and a third cabled circuit (18-19), referred to as
a validation circuit, to authorise subsequent execution

of an authentication corresponding to a different random
number from the characteristic random number only if the

second circuit indicates that the state of the register
has changed.
A chip as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the register is a counter (6) provided with read-only

memory cells.
A chip as claimed in one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the first and the second cabled

logic circuit have a flip-flop RS and in that the
validation circuit has an OR or NOR gate connected at the

output of these two flip-flops.
A chip as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that the bits of the characteristic random number are

identical to one another, preferably being one, and in
that the first logic circuit has an AND gate receiving

these bits ("random number") and a receiving signal
("random zone") for these bits, this AND gate being

connected at the input of the flip-flop RS of the second
logic circuit.
A chip as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the register is a counter for

prepaid units, the number of which is limited, of a
telephone chip card.
