<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyolefin
packaging material and, more
particularly, to a polyolefin packaging material for drug
packaging which is free or substantially free of the risk
of its reacting with and adversely affecting the drug
packaged therewith.Packaging materials for packing various drugs or
medicinal chemicals, including antibiotics, either in
dosage forms or as bulk substances, are required to be
heat-sealable and flexible as well as free of plasticizer
and other additives that may exert adverse influences on
the drugs. From these viewpoints, polyolefin films, in
particular linear low-density polyethylene (hereinafter
referred to "LLDPE") films have generally been used.
However, certain kinds of drugs, in particular cephem, β-lactam,
carbapenem, aminoglycoside, polypeptide, macrolide
antibiotics and the like, may interact with the above-mentioned
polyolefin films, though to slight extents, thus 
producing objectionable reaction products. The formation
of such reaction products detracts from drug purity and/or
causes turbidity of solutions on the occasion of
dissolution or reconstitution. It is possible that the
reaction products adversely affect patients. Therefore,
glass vials have exclusively been used in storing such
antibiotics as mentioned above while film packaging has
been avoided in such cases.In recent years, a method has been developed in
the United States of America according to which a unit
dose of an antibiotic is placed in a flexible container
made of a polyolefin, in place of a glass vial, so that
the antibiotic may be dissolved and administered with
greater convenience (cf. e.g. Japanese Patent Publication
No. H03-33337). Even in that case, however, no regard has
been paid to the formation of reaction products resulting
from contact of the container with the drug, hence
decreases in potency and/or unsatisfactory dissolution may
unfavorably result with the lapse of time. For preventing
such potency decreases, it is necessary to store the drug-containing
flexible container in a cold place. Even in a
frozen state, interactions between the drug and the
container cannot be inhibited, however. Thus, the above
method is not fully satisfactory from the handling
standpoint. Recently, in particular, the so-called kit,
which is a combination of a drug container such as
mentioned above and a container for a solvent, has been a
favorite subject of research and development. From the
viewpoint of implementation of such kits as well, the
problem of interaction between the container

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a polyolefin packaging material in which the polyolefin
does not contain more than 150 ppm of substances containing 12 to 26 carbon

atoms, the method comprising treating a polyolefin using a vent-type extruder at a
resin temperature of 150-300°C and a reduced pressure of not more than 133 kPa

(100 torr) without using any stripping agents, and then forming the thus treated
polyolefin into a film or sheet.
Method according to claim 1 wherein a linear low-density polyethylene is treated.
Method according to claim 2 comprising the treatment of linear low-density
polyethylene at a resin temperature of 170 to 230°C and a reduced pressure of not

more than 13 kPa (10 torr).
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 optionally containing the step of
forming the film or sheet to a multi-layer structure, at least the innermost layer

thereof being made of the polyolefin obtainable by the process according to any one
of claims 1 to 3.
A container for drug packaging as molded using the polyolefin packaging material
obtainable by the method according to any one of claims 1 to 4.
Use of the polyolefin packaging material obtainable by the method according to
any one of claims 1 to 4 for packaging drugs.
Use according to claim 6 wherein the drug is an antibiotic.
