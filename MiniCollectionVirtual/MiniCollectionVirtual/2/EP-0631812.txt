<ABSTRACT>
To accelerate the decrease in pressure on emptying a pressurised space (5), on the wall (1) of this is mounted an outlet valve (9) and a module (10) for control thereof. By means of two pressure accumulators (19, 20) and throttles (17, 18) upstream of these, the module (10) generates, from the air pressure p in the pressurised space (5) a control signal, proportional to its rate of change dp/dt for opening the valve (9). The accelerated pressure decrease achievable by this device which can move with the pressurised space (5) and operates autonomously permits an increase in the number of press cycles and thus the yield per hour of pneumatic fruit presses which can be retrofitted inexpensively with this.

Process for accelerating the exchange of air or gas as the pressure medium when
evacuating a pressure chamber (5), characterised in that evacuation is effected not

only by means of an outlet arrangement (7, 26), but also partially by means of at
least one controllable valve (9) mounted on the wall (1) of the pressure chamber

(5) and movable together therewith, that the valve (9) is controlled by a control
module (10) mounted on the wall (1) of the pressure chamber (5) and also

movable together therewith and that the control module (10) is supplied
autonomously with energy by means of a line connection (11) to the pressure

medium in the interior of the pressure chamber (5) and is controlled directly by
means of the line connection (11) to the pressure medium without using further

aids as a function of the magnitude and the variation of the pressure of the
pressure medium in the interior of the pressure chamber (5) with time.
Process according to claim 1, in which the pressure chamber (5) is part of a means
for separating liquid and solid substances with a rotatably mounted pressing

container (1) which is divided into a pressure chamber (5) and a pressing chamber
(6) by means of a flexible membrane (4), the pressure chamber (5) having an inlet

arrangement (7) for the pressure medium and the pressing chamber (6) having an
outlet arrangement (8) for the liquid substances to be separated off and separation

being effected by means of at least one pressing cycle and a loosening cycle for
loosening the solid substances, characterised in that the controllable valve (9) is

held closed by the control module (10) at the beginning of the pressing cycle (29)
as the pressure in the pressure chamber (5) increases, is opened at the end of the

pressing cycle (29) when the drop in pressure exceeds a threshold value (A) and is
closed again when a minimum pressure is reached.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure medium in the
interior of the pressure chamber (5) acts directly on the control module (10).
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that the control module (10) is
operated 
exclusively by the energy of the pressure medium. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the magnitude and the variation
of the pressure of the pressure medium in the interior of the pressure chamber (5)

with time are fed to the control module by means of electric signals and these
signals are processed in the control module by means of electrical components.
Pressure chamber (5) with a means for accelerating the exchange of air or gas as
the pressure medium when evacuating the pressure chamber (5) by means of an

outlet arrangement (7, 26), characterised by at least one controllable valve (9)
mounted on the wall (1) of the pressure chamber, movable together therewith and

connecting the pressure chamber (5) to the surrounding atmosphere and by a
control module (10) for controlling the valve (9) mounted on the wall (1) of the

pressure chamber (5) and also movable together therewith, the control module
(10) being operatively connected to the pressure medium in the interior of the

pressure chamber (5) by means of a line connection (11) for energy supply and
control.
Pressure chamber according to claim 6, characterised in that the valve (9) is a
spring-loaded flap valve and that the control module (10) is assembled from a first

pneumatically operated 2-way valve (13) with two control ports (21, 22), two
pressure tanks (19, 20) connected, on the one hand, by means of respective

throttles (17, 18) with through openings of different sizes to the pressure medium
in the interior of the pressure chamber (5) and, on the other hand, to respective

control ports (21, 22) of the first 2-way valve (13), and a second 2-way valve (14)
to which the pressure medium of the pressure chamber (5) can be connected

through from the first 2-way valve (13) by means of a line (11) and which in turn
connects this pressure medium through to the control input (15) of the flap valve

(9) only when a minimum pressure (p(min)) is exceeded.
Pressure chamber according to claim 7, characterised in that the through-connection
threshold of the minimum pressure at the second 2-way valve (14) is

adjustable. 
Pressure chamber according to claim 6, characterised in that the control module
includes a differential element which generates an output signal when the drop in

pressure within the pressure chamber exceeds a threshold value, thereby opening
the controllable valve by means of a 2-way valve with the aid of a supply pressure

source independent of the pressure within the pressure chamber.
Pressure chamber according to claim 9, characterised in that the pressure of the
supply pressure source is fed by means of a rotating inlet to the controllable valve

movable together with the pressure chamber.
Pressure chamber according to claim 6, characterised by a plurality of controllable
valves mounted on the wall of the pressure chamber, movable together therewith

and connecting the pressure chamber to the surrounding atmosphere.
Pressure chamber according to one of claims 6-11, characterised in that the
controllable valves mounted on the wall of the pressure chamber, movable together

therewith and connecting the pressure chamber to the surrounding atmosphere are
provided on the surrounding atmosphere side with sound absorbers.
Pressure chamber according to one of claims 6-11, characterised in that the at least
one controllable valve (9) mounted on the wall (1) of the pressure chamber (5),

movable together therewith and connecting the pressure chamber (5) to the
surrounding atmosphere and the control module (10) for controlling the valve (9)

mounted on the wall (1) of the pressure chamber (5) and also movable together
therewith are arranged at least partially in the interior of the pressure chamber (5).
