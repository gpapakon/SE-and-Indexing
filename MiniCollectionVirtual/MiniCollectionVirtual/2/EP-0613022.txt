Sensitivity time control (STC) data for an airborne 
weather radar system is provided as a function of aircraft 

altitude and radar system antenna tilt angle to normalize 
radar return signals at high as well as low aircraft 

altitudes. In one form of the invention the STC data is 
used to adjust the gain of a signal applied to a radar 

system received by a system antenna and in another form of 
the invention the STC data is used to establish a desired 

threshold for said signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to airborne weather
radar systems and, more particularly, to systems of the type
described with aircraft altitude and antenna tilt angle
dependent sensitivity time control for normalizing return
signals from a target at high as well as low altitudes.For airborne weather radar systems, the level of return
signals from a target is a function of target range. As the
range increases, the level of the return signals is reduced.
Sensitivity time control (STC) is a well known means for
controlling the radar system receiver gain as a function of
time, which is equivalent to range, in order to normalize
the level of return signals from targets at different
ranges.For airborne weather radar systems with beam filling
targets, the return signal levels are proportional to the
inverse of the range squared. As a result, normally six dB
per octave has been an accepted and specified STC slope. In
this regard, reference is made to the publication RTCA
DO-173, Minimum Operational Performance Standards For
Airborne Weather And Ground Mapping Pulse Radars.Weather cells, i.e. thunderstorms and the like, have
high reflectivity at low altitudes due to rain droplets in
the weather cells resulting in high return signal levels.
At higher altitudes, the water content in the weather cells
is in the form of ice with much lower reflectivity resulting
in low return signal levels. The crossover altitude between
high and low reflectivity has been found to be within twenty
and twenty-five thousand feet. When an aircraft is flying
above these altitudes, the radar beam reacts to both low and
high reflectivity of the weather cells. As a result, the
return signal levels do not follow the aforementioned 
nominal six dB per octave slope. Thus, if an airborne
weather radar system uses the nominal six dB per octave
slope for STC, the system excessively attenuates return
signals from close-in (high altitude) targets. This problem
has been analyzed and described in an article entitled
"Comparison of Airborne and Ground Based Weather Radars" by
Lester P. Merritt, published in December, 1969 by the
National Severe Storms Laboratory, ESSA, U.S. Department of
Commerce. The present invention obviates this problem by
normalizing return signal levels for high as well as low
aircraft altitudes. WO92/22831 describes an airborne weather radar system which compensates
for the attenuation of return signals resulting from precipitation using a
correction curve that includes a segment for negligible self attenuation caused
by a
