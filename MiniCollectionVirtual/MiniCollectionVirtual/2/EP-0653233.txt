<ABSTRACT>
Plant for separating light (low-density) matter and/or suspended matter (settleable solids, sediments) from waste water. Above the feed line (1, 12) to the separator is arranged a collection vessel (6) acting as a buffer which can be charged or emptied via the pump (7) with appropriate setting of the valves (3, 9, 11). To avoid separation in the collection vessel (6), the contents can be circulated by pumping with valves (3, 11) closed and valve (9) open.
