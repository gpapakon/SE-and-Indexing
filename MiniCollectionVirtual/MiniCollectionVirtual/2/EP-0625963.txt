<DESCRIPTION>
It has long been known that acetylene, given its 
thermodynamic characteristics, which make it unstable 
under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, 
is stored and sold in cylinders, dissolved in special 
solvents, usually acetone or dimethylformamide: Use is 
made of the high solubility of the said gas in the 
abovementioned solvents, which allow it to be handled 
very safely. Acetone or dimethylformamide or solvents with 
analogous properties are normally absorbed on porous 
masses having a monolithic structure, which completely 
fill the acetylene cylinder. One of the principal functions 
of the porous mass consists in preventing 
possible strikeback of flames which may develop 
downstream from the cylinder, and to block, from the 
outset, acetylene decomposition phenomena inside the 
actual cylinder, initiated by external causes such as 
localised overheating or others. It is therefore particularly important that such 
filling materials should not exhibit empty spaces, 
cavities or interstices which might initiate dangerous 
decomposition phenomena. On the other hand, however, 
the materials must possess high porosity to facilitate 
the absorption and the subsequent release of the acetylene 
when it is being used. The material must furthermore 
be incombustible, inert towards acetylene and its 
solvents, and light-weight, and must possess special 
strength properties which make it virtually 
unalterable, namely not prone to fissuring and disintegrating  
 
to powder over the course of years. Very good results have been obtained with masses 
having a silico-calcium composition, forming the subject 
of various patents, with the addition of binders, 
asbestos being particularly preferred, which impart to 
the whole a support skeleton with the twofold purpose 
of improving the strength and plasticity of the final 
mass and of maintaining the various constituents in 
suspension in the fluid mixture, from the stage of 
preparation of the mixture through to the stage of 
setting in the subsequent oven-baking stage. Certain recent patents (EP 56,645; EP 64,916; 
EP 262,031; USP 4,970,246) propose replacing the 
asbestos (which is known to have toxic properties) with 
other fibres, with or without addition of suspending 
agents and thickeners necessary to maintain uniform 
fibre distribution and to avoid sedimentation of the 
solids prior to oven-setting. The present invention relates to the preparation 
of a porous mass of silico-calcium composition, free 
from asbestos and containing inorganic

<CLAIMS>
Monolithic porous mass free from asbestos, for 
filling acetylene cylinders, the mass being based on 

calcium silicate obtained from lime and crystalline 
quartz powder and containing a binder consisting of 

inorganic synthetic fibres based on carbon in a content 
less than or equal to 12% by weight relative to the dry 

mass and optionally vermiculite in an amount less than 20% 
by weight relative to the dry mass, with the optional 

addition of one or more dispersing and densifying 
agents, characterized in that said inorganic synthetic 

fibres based on carbon possess hydrophilic properties 
and have a rough surface. 
Porous mass according to Claim 1, in which the 
densifying agent is attapulgite, in an amount of at 

most 13% by weight. 
Process for the preparation of the porous mass 
according to Claims 1-2, characterized by the following 

stages: 

a) treatment of calcium oxide with water at a 
temperature of from 20 to 60°C; 
b) addition of inorganic synthetic fibres based on 
carbon, followed by homogenisation; 
c) optional addition of a dispersing and densifying 
agent; 
d) addition of crystalline quartz powder; 
e) baking of the mass at 180°C; and 
f) drying at 280°C, 
 
in which stages b), c) and d) can also be carried out  

 
in different sequences. 
Process according to Claim 3, in which the ratio of 
calcium oxide to crystalline quartz powder is between 

1:1 and 1:1.3, the ratio of crystalline quartz powder 
to vermiculite is between 1:0.5 and 1:0.09 and the 

ratio of attapulgite to crystalline quartz powder is 
1:2.6.
