<ABSTRACT>
A sealing structure for a panel-mounted electrical 
connector seals fixed and detachable connector housings (2, 

4). A waterproof seal (20) has a double seal structure 
including inner and outer peripheral side sealing portions 

(21, 22) surrounding a mounting hole (6) of a panel (5) in 
which the connector is fitted, for sealing a gap between the 

detachable connector housing (4) and the outer face of the 
panel 4. The sealing structure further includes a subseal 

(25) sealing a gap between a hood (3) of the fixed connector 
housing (2) and the detachable connector housing (4) in the 

inner peripheral side of the waterproof seal (20). When 
water flows through a gap between the mounting hole (6) and 

the hood (3) from the inside of the panel (5), the subseal 
(25) prevents the water from invading a gap between the hood 

(3) and the detachable connector housing (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 
panel-mounted electrical connector fitted in a mounting hole 
formed in a panel and comprising a sealing structure. Figs. 7 to 9 illustrate a conventional sealing 
structure for providing waterproof between a mounting hole 
136 formed in a panel 135 and a panel-mounted electrical 
connector 130 fitted in the mounting hole 136. The panel-mounted 
connector 130 having the shown sealing structure 
comprises a fixed connector housing 131 with a hood 132 and 
a detachable connector housing 133 fitted in the hood 132. 
In the mounting of the fixed connector housing 131, the hood 
132 of the fixed connector housing 131 is fitted into the 
mounting hole 136 from the inside of the panel 135 or from 
the left-hand side as viewed in Fig. 7. A locking piece 134 
is then engaged with the edge of the mounting hole 136. On 
the other hand, the detachable connector housing 133 is 
fitted into the hood 132 from the outside of the panel 135 
or from the right-hand side as viewed in Fig. 7. The 
detachable connector housing 133 is then fixed by a bolt 138 
with a grommet 137 covering an opening of the hood 132. A seal 140 is integrally formed along the outer 
periphery of the grommet 137 and is disposed annularly along 
the peripheral edge of the mounting hole 136. The seal 140 
has an angular section so as to be pointed toward the panel 
135, as shown in Fig. 8. The seal 140 is pressed against an 
outside seal face 139 of the panel 135 upon attachment of  
 
the detachable connector housing 133 to the fixed connector 
housing 131, whereupon the seal 140 is closely adhered to 
the seal face 139 with elastic deformation. Thus, since the 
whole peripheral edge of the mounting hole 136 is surrounded 
by the seal 140, the outer periphery of the detachable 
connector housing 133 is isolated from the seal face 139. 
Consequently, water or the like can be prevented from 
invading the inside of the panel 135 from the outside 
thereof through a gap between the mounting hole 136 and the 
panel-mounted connector 130. The above-described sealing structure poses the 
following problems. When the seal 140 is closely adhered to 
the panel 135, the pointed distal end of the seal 140 first 
undergoes the elastic deformation and finally, the whole 
seal elastically deforms. Since the seal 140 has the 
angular section, the elastic deformation thereof is 
unstable. Accordingly, there is a possibility that the 
elastic deformation of the seal 140 is not uniform 
throughout an annular path along which the seal 140
