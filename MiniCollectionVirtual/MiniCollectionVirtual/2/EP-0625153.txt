Isoindolinone derivative of formula: 

 
in racemic form or in the form of its enantiomers, as 

well as its salts. 
Process for preparing the product according to 
Claim 1 in racemic form, characterized in that the 

hydration of a product of formula: 

 
in racemic form, is carried out in the presence of an 

acid in an aqueous-organic medium. 
Process for preparing the enantiomers of the 
product according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

separation of the constituents of the racemic product 
according to Claim 1 is carried out by high-performance 

liquid chromatography on a silica column coated with 
cellulose triphenylcarbamate.  

 
Process for preparing the enantiomers of the 
product according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

constituents of the racemic product of formula: 

 
are separated by high-performance liquid chromatography 

on a modified Pirkle-type phase and then each of the 
enantiomers thus obtained is hydrated. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the modified Pirkle type phase is defined by the 

structure: 

 
in which the symbols R, which are identical or different, 

and R₁, which are identical or different, represent alkyl 
radicals containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, G₁ represents 

an electron-attracting group and n represents an integer 
between 3 and 13 inclusive. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the modified Pirkle-type phase is defined by the 

structure:  
 


 
in which one of the symbols R represents an alkyl radical 

containing 7 to 10 carbon atoms and the other two 
represent an alkyl radical containing 1 or 2 carbon 

atoms, the symbols R₁ are identical and represent a 
methyl or ethyl radical, G₁ represents a benzoyl radical 

optionally substituted by one or more nitro radicals and 
n is equal to 10. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the modified Pirkle phase is defined by the 

structure: 

The modified Pirkle-type phase as defined according 
to one of Claims 5, 6 or 7. 
Pharmaceutical composition characterized in that 
it contains at least one product according to Claim 1 in 

racemic form or in the form of its enantiomers in combination 
with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable inert 

or therapeutically active diluents or adjuvants.
