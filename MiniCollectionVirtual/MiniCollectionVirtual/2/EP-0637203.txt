<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved means for regulating the immune response, for ameliorating effects of stress, and for avoiding untoward effects of chemotherapy or exposure to irradiation by administration of androstenediol (AED) and androstenetriol (AET). The improved means of regulating immune response can be utilized in treating infectious diseases and immune diseases such as diabetes and chronic fatigue syndrome, both diseases now considered to be immune response related syndromes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improved means for
regulating the immune response, for ameliorating effects
of stress, and for avoiding untoward effects of chemotherapy
or exposure to irradiation by administration of androstenediol
(AED) and androstenetriol (AET). The improved
means of regulating immune response can be utilized in
treating infectious diseases and immune diseases such as
diabetes and chronic fatigue syndrome, both diseases now
considered to be immune response related syndromes.In vertebrates the development of host protection
against pathogens requires a selective host immune response
that involves the mobilization of the humoral
and/or cellular mediated immune responses. Several factors
adversely affect the body's protective response
capability by causing prolonged immuno-suppression or
"down-regulation" of the immune system. It is, in reality,
more appropriate to speak of "mal-regulation" or
"deregulation" of the immune system than of "down-regulation"
since the result is a failure to protect the body
from assault. Immuno-suppression provides an opportunity
for pathogens to grow in the host. It does not matter
what causes the primary insult to immunity. The resulting
inability to muster the appropriate immune response has
the same effect. Among the many different causes of
immuno-suppression are viral, bacterial, fungal, yeast and
parasitic infections, chemotherapy, irradiation, severe
stress, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes mellitus and
some forms of steroid therapy.It has long been known that patients receiving steroid
hormones of adrenocortical origin at pharmacologically 
appropriate doses show increased incidence of infectious
disease. A.S. Fauci, immunolo.rev.65, 133-155
(1982); and J.E. Parillo and A.S. Fauci, Annual Review of
Pharmacology and Toxicology19, 179-201 (1979). Dehydroepiandrosterone,
also known as 3-β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one
or dehydroiso-androsterone (referred to hereinafter as
DHEA), is a 17-ketosteroid which is quantitatively one of
the major adrenocortical steroid hormones found in mammals.

(1976); K. Diem and C. Lentner, GeigyScientificTables
(1975). (Although DHEA appears to serve as an intermediary
in gonadal steroid synthesis, the primary physiological
function of DHEA has not been fully understood. It has
been known, however, that levels of this hormone begin to
decline in the second decade of life, reaching 5% of the
original level in the elderly.)Clinically, DHEA has been used systemically and/or
