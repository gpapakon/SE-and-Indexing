<ABSTRACT>
A percutaneously administrable base composition which facilitates the percutaneous absorption of drugs and is remarkably 

reduced in the irritancy against the skin. The composition comprises 10-60 wt. % of lower alcohol, 10-50 wt. % of humectant, 
10-70 wt. % of water, 0.1-15 wt. % of abirritant and 0.1-15 wt. % of absorption promoter. A drug composition is prepared by 

adding to the above composition various active ingredients such as antitussive, expectorant, skeletal muscle relaxant, antivertiginous 
drug, narcotic, drug for the circulatory system, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a percutaneously
administrable base composition which increases
percutaneous absorption of a drug and has a low irritation
against skin, and a drug composition prepared therefrom.As conventional drug administration methods oral
administration, rectal administration, intracutaneous administration,
and intravenous administration are generally
known. Especially oral administration is popularly adopted
among others. Oral administration has been defective in
that the liver is susceptible to primary metabolism after
absorption of the drug, and a higher blood concentration of
drug than the necessary level is observed temporarily after
oral administration. Furthermore, many cases of gastrointestinal
trouble, feeling of vomiting, anorexia and other
side effects are reported.Recently, therefore, with a view to solving these
defects of oral administration, the method of percutaneous
administration is attracting the general attention as permitting
absorption of a drug safely and continuously.
Efforts have been made to develop external-use drugs for
this purpose, and some products have already been put to the
market.In the drugs for such percutaneous administration,
however, percutaneous absorption of the drug is still on a
low level in many cases, and the object seems to be far from 
fully being achieved.More particularly, normal skin has originally a
barrier function of preventing ingression of a xenobiotic
substance into the body. A base alone used for ordinary
percutaneous administration cannot therefore ensure sufficient
percutaneous absorption of effective ingredients
blended therein. It is therefore necessary to make contrivances
to improve percutaneous absorption of a drug by controlling
the barrier function of the horny substance layer
of skin. For this purpose, blending of a material known as
percutaneous absorption promoter into the base is generally
attempted. For example, there have been proposed dimethyl
acetamide combined with ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or
myristyl alcohol as an absorption promoter in combination
with a lower alkylamide (U.S. Patent No. 3,472,931), a
combination of 2-pyrrolidone, an appropriate oil, and a
straight-chain fatty acid with ester of alcohol (U.S. Patent
No. 4,017,641), and a combination of an alcohol having
a carbon number of from 7 to 20, an aliphatic hydrocarbon
having a carbon number of from 5 to 30, an alcohol ester of
aliphatic carboxylic acid having a carbon number of from 19
to 26, mono- or di-ether having a carbon number of
