<ABSTRACT>
A pasta cooker (10) which includes an open water tank (12) shaped 
to receive pasta for cooking, a heater (44) for boiling water in the 

tank, a trough (58) positioned to receive and collect starch foam from 
an upper surface of the water in tank, and a drain (78) for draining 

water from the trough and tank, the drain including a screen box (76) 
for filtering pasta particles and starch foam from drained water to 

prevent clogging of drains downstream of the screen box. The 
trough (58) is coextensive with a front upper edge of the water tank, 

and the cooker (10) includes a water fill valve which is actuatable to 
fill the tank such that a small amount of water continuously washes 

over from the tank into the trough during the cooking of pasta, 
thereby conveying starch foam floating on the upper surface of the 

water of the tank to the trough. The screen box (76) includes a 
removable drawer having perforated sides and positioned to receive 

the water and starch foam drained the from the trough and tank. 
The drawer is positioned within a housing shaped to collect water 

flowing through the drawer, and to receive water which overflows 
from the drawer in the event that the drawer becomes completely 

clogged. The screen box (78) includes a downwardly and rearwardly 
sloping floor (156) to direct drained water toward a rear opening (194) 

connected to a conventional drain pipe (196). The pasta cooker 
preferably includes a second tank, also draining into a screen box, 

for washing cooked pasta. The second tank also includes a flexible 
spray nozzle for cleaning both tanks and washing cooked pasta.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cooking devices, and
more particularly, devices designed for boiling pasta in a
commercial environment.Traditionally, the commercial preparation of pasta
involved the boiling of pasta in large pots on a gas stove, or
alternately, the boiling of pasta in large pans on a gas stove, the
pans including apparatus for tilting the pan to pour out its
contents. However, with the advent of high-volume commercial food
establishments which serve pasta, there is need for devices which
are designed exclusively for boiling pasta on a continuous and
high-volume basis.An initial attempt at developing such a device consisted
of the conversion of a deep fat fryer. With that device, the tank
for holding cooking oil was converted into a water holding tank,
and pasta was placed in baskets positioned within the tank and
cooked while the water in the tank was boiled.Such converted devices possess inherent disadvantages.
For example, as a result of the continuous cooking of pasta, the
water in the tank quickly became clogged with starch foam, making
it difficult to observe the cooking of the pasta, and increasing
the amount of time required for cleaning. Further, the tank drains
tended to become clogged easily with starch foam and pasta
particles, which become extremely sticky when deposited on metal
surfaces, such as the stainless steel of the drain openings.Accordingly, there is a need for a pasta cooker which is
capable of preparing pasta on a high-volume basis in which the 
problems of starch foam and drain clogging are minimized.Patent specification EP-A-0513817 discloses a pasta
cooking apparatus comprising a tank for holding water and
an overflow weir located adjacent the tank to define a
maximum water level in the tank at which point water flows
from the tank by gravity into a waste drain arrangement.
The tank also includes heating means for heating the water
therein and means for adding water to the tank under
pressure. The arrangement also includes level detecting
means which are adapted to detect a water level which is
below the level of the overflow weir and means responsive
to said level detecting means adapted to add water to the
tank so that the tank can be automatically filled so that
the water level may be maintained at a predetermined level.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided an apparatus for cooking pasta comprising
a boiling tank, means for heating water in said boiling
tank, a trough communicating with said boiling tank, and
means to add
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cooking pasta comprising a boiling
tank (12), means (32,34,36) for heating water in said

boiling tank (12), a trough (58) communicating with said
boiling tank (12), and means (92) to add water to said

boiling tank, characterised in that said trough (58) is
positioned adjacent an upper edge of said tank (12) and

having a downwardly sloping wall (60) such that pasta
starch is continually and automatically removed from the

boiling tank (12) and the apparatus further comprising
screen means (76) for receiving and capturing pasta starch

entrained in water received by said trough (58).
An apparatus according to Claim 1, further
comprising drain means (64) for removing starch foam and

water from said trough means.
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein said means (92) to add water includes means for

continuously filling said tank (12) with water such
that an upper surface of said water in said tank (12)

is substantially co-extensive with an upper edge of said
trough (58), whereby starch foam floating on said

upper surface continuously washes into said trough
(58).
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, further comprising means (80) for draining said

tank (12), said draining means (80) being connected
to direct water from said tank (12) to said screen

means (76). 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, wherein said
screen means (76) includes a screen connected to said

trough (12) to receive water therefrom.
An apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein
