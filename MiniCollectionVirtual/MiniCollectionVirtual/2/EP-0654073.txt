<ABSTRACT>
A composition comprising a hydroxyoxime together with the reaction product of an alkyl substituted cyclic anhydride and a hydrophilic compound containing hydroxyl and/or amino groups, a process which comprises treating at least part of the surface of a metal with the composition, a metal coated with the composition, and a lubricant composition comprising the composition and an oil or a grease. The reaction product of the alkyl cyclic anhydride may be the reaction product of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride and ethanolamine. The hydroxyoxime may be 2-hydroxy-5-nonylbenzaldoxime or 2-hydroxy-5-nonylacetophenoneoxime. The composition may be used to inhibit corrosion of metals, particularly iron.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITION AND USEThis invention relates to a new composition, and the use of such a composition to inhibit the corrosion of metals, especial ly when incorporated into oi Is and greases, and thus to a process which comprises treating least part of the surface of a metal with the composition, a metal coated with the composition, and a lubricant composition comprising the composition and an oi I or a grease.In our publ i shed European Patent App I i cat i on No 247728"υ there is disclosed a composition comprising an optional ly substituted hydroxyoxime and an anhydride containing a long alkyl chain. The composition may be incorporated into an oi I for the protection of metal surfaces against corrosion, and under most conditions, the composition provides extremely good'5 protection of the metal surface against corrosion. However, when moisture is present the efficacy of the composition can be severely impaired, and the βnt i -corrosi ve properties imparted to the metal surface can be unacceptable.The composition disclosed in EP 247728 can also be 0 incorporated in to greases for the lubrication of metal surfaces which are in sl iding or frictional contact. In most instances such grease formulations provide excel lent antiwear characteristics on those metal surfaces. However^ in the presence of moisture, the grease has been found to destructure 25 under certain circumstances and the lubricating characteristic of the grease is lost thus resulting in greater wear and/or corrosion of ^ he metal surfaces.We have now found that improved corrosion inhibition and greater resistance to moisture can be obtained u ing a mixture30 of a hydroxyoxime compound together with the reaction product of a substituted cycl ic anhydride and an organic moiety containing ami no and/or hydroxyl groups.35 

 That such compositions have been found effective is surprising, since in most cases the individual components of the composition have been found to exhibit I ittle, if any, ant i -corros i on properties, when incorporated into to an oi l and app I i ed to a metal surface.According to the present invention, there is provided a compos i t i on compr i s i ng a) a surface—act i ve anhydride derivative of the general formu I a IX-Y-(Z), (I )where i nX represents a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group containing from 8 to 500 carbon atoms;Y represents a succinic anhydride residue or an aromatic anhydride residue carried terminal ly on the group X; each Z independently represents an organic group carrying an oxygen, sulphur or
