<DESCRIPTION>
A hydrogenation catalyst, and a method for its preparation and use, in particular for hydrogenation and/o^ hydrogenolysis of carbohydrates and polyhydric alcoholsThe present invention relates to methods for hydrogenation of carbohydrates and hydrogenolysis of higher polyhydric alcohols, and to a new hydrogenation catalyst which is useful in particular for producing lower polyhydric alcohols from renewable materials, such as in particular carbohydrates and higher polyhydric alcohols.In the present description, the term "higher polyhydric alcohols" means products such as sorbitol , mannitol and xylitol derived from catalytic hydrogenation of carbohydrates (and in particular of glucose, fructose and their mixtures) .The term "lower polyhydric alcohols" means polyalcohols having a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and a maximum of 3 hydroxyl groups, in particular ethanediol, propylene glycol, butanediol and glycerol.The invention also relates to a method for preparing the new catalyst.U.S. 2,868,847 describes a method for catalytic hydrogenation of mono- and disaccharides for producing polyhydroxyl alcohols, in particular sorbitol, and proposes replacing the known platinum and palladium- based catalysts used for this method, by a ruthenium 

catalyst or by a metallic catalyst based on ruthenium and platinum or palladium.U.S. 4,476,331 describes a method for producing lower polyhydric alcohols comprising a first stage of hydrogenation of carbohydrates with production of higher polyhydric alcohols and a second stage in which the higher polyhydric alcohols are subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of a ruthenium-based catalyst which is pre-sulphurised or is sulphurised in use by addition of sulphurised compounds to the reactive medium. Sulphurisation of the ruthenium-based catalyst is necessary in order to limit the hydrogenolysis reaction which would otherwise lead to the formation of highly hydrogenated compounds (hydrocarbons, and in particular methane).The main object of the present invention is to provide a method for hydrogenolysis of higher polyhydric alcohols which has a high selectivity towards the production of lower polyhydric alcohols, thus keeping to a minimum the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons which constitute an undesirable product.For this purpose an object of the present invention is a new metallic catalyst on an inert support, characterised in that it comprises the following relative to the (anhydrous) weight of the catalyst: 

a) 0.5 to 5 weight % ruthenium; b) 1 to 10 weight % of a metal
