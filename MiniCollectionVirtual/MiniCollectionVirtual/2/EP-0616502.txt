<ABSTRACT>
A coffee dispensing and brewing apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention comprises components for dispensing a predetermined amount of coffee to a brew basket (121), the components including a hopper (28) for holding a supply of coffee beans and an auger device (48) communicating with the hopper for portioning coffee beans in a predetermined amount to a coffee grinder (96). The apparatus further includes a brew basket holding assembly (122) for releasably holding the brew brasket (121) in a region adjacent a passageway (126) to the grinder and a hot water making and delivery system for distributing a predetermined volume of hot water from a hot water holding tank (102) to the region during a brewing cycle. The grinder motor (94) has a right angle power transmission (98) that couples the motor to the grinder (96) with the motor being located below the grinder and adjacent a vertical side of the holding tank (102).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coffee dispenser and brewer
apparatus and, more particularly, to a multi-hopper coffee
dispenser and brewer apparatus with a coffee portioning component
capable of delivering various types and amounts of coffee to a
brew basket and a hot water delivery component capable of
distributing corresponding volumes of hot water to the brew
basket and a control system therefor.Coffee dispensing and brewing systems are found in many
forms providing many functions. Some systems provide for the
automatic brewing of ground coffee packaged in a predetermined
quantity manually placed in a brewing chamber. A predetermined
volume of hot water is delivered to the brewing chamber once a
start switch is closed to initiate the brewing cycle.Still other systems meter predetermined portions of ground
coffee from a hopper to the brewing chamber followed by a
delivery of a predetermined volume of hot water to the chamber.
Such systems typically use a slide valve arrangement to meter the
ground coffee to the brewing chamber. More sophisticated systems
of this type may employ multi-hopper arrangements with each
hopper containing a different type of ground coffee and allows
the user to chose the kind of coffee to be brewed. Other systems
allow the user to manually control the amount of ground coffee
and volume of hot water delivered to the brewing chamber.Still another coffee dispensing and brewing system finding
increasing acceptance with households, restaurants and the
vending machinery industry combines a coffee portioner, grinder
and brewer into an integrated system. A major reason for the
popularity of this type of system is due to the increasing 
sophistication of the coffee consumer who dictates that brewed
coffee be as fresh as possible, thus requiring the grinding of
the beans be as close as possible in time and location to the
brewer. Additionally, it is desirable that the coffee be
measured accurately from throw to throw to provide a consistency
to the brewed beverage.Finally, any combination grinder brewer should be able to
accommodate different coffee beverages, e.g., caffeinated and
decaffeinated beverages, and the use of specially treated and/or
flavored coffee. Flavored coffee is often permeated with
substances, sticky to handle, which may gum up the interior
working parts of the coffee transporting and/or grinding
components of the apparatus.To provide a system that permits combining the features
mentioned above into a single unit, however, is not an easy task.

<CLAIMS>
A coffee dispensing and brewing apparatus having a
coffee delivery and brewing cycle, said apparatus (10) including

a hopper (12) for holding coffee, a brew basket (121) for receiving
coffee and hot water, means (48, 56, 246, 248, 250, 252)

communicating with said hopper (12) for portioning coffee in
predetermined amounts and delivering said predetermined amount

to said brew basket (121), hot water means (102, 288, 290, 292,
294) for delivering a predetermined amount of hot water to a hot

water distributor (120a, 124, 126) positioned above said brew
basket (121) to distribute hot water over coffee grounds positioned

in said brew basket (121), and control means (201, 272,
274) including a start cycle button (92) for generating a signal

to initiate the coffee delivery and brewing cycle, said control
means initiating said cycle when said control switch is placed

in the start position, said portioning means (48, 56, 246, 248,
250, 252) responsive to said signal for initiating portioning

and delivering of said coffee and said hot water distributing
means responsive to said signal for thereafter delivering and

distributing hot water to said brew basket (121),

   
characterized
 by said brew basket (121) being removable
from said apparatus and adapted to being manually filled with

coffee and returned to said apparatus, and

   by having a brew only means (82, 282) for selectively
interrupting said signal to said portioning means, said signal

being interrupted when said brew only means (82) is activated
and said start switch (92) is placed in the start position,

thereby rendering said portioning means (48, 56, 246, 248, 250,
252) inactive during said cycle and only hot water is delivered

to said hot water distributor (120a, 124, 126) and distributed
to said brew basket (121) and thereafter passing through said

brew basket (121) manually filled with coffee. 
The apparatus of claim 1 in which there are a
plurality of hoppers (28).
The apparatus of claim 2 in which said hoppers
(28) hold coffee beans, said portioning device further comprising 

a means (48, 56) for transporting coffee from a selected
one of said hoppers (28) and a grinder (96) for receiving coffee

beans from said transporting means (48, 56) grinding said beans
into ground coffee and delivering said ground coffee to said

brew basket (12).
The apparatus of claim 3 in which said transporting
means is a plurality of auger elements (48) and motors (56)

for driving said augers (48), each of said auger elements (48)
associated with one of said hoppers (28).
