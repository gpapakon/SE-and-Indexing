<ABSTRACT>
A conjugate of at least two binding sites which bind specifically to the analyte-specific binding region of the receptor which is used for detection in a test, where the binding sites are linked by at least one soluble carrier substance, and the conjugate is the product of a synthetic or recombinant preparation, dissolved in an aqueous solution in an accurately known quantity, is particularly suitable as stable calibrator in a test for detecting an analyte.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a liquid-stable calibrator in a test for the detection of an analyte,

characterized in that
 said calibrator is a conjugate composed in each case of at
least two identical binding sites which bind to two different receptors that

bind specifically to the analyte-specific binding region of the said receptors
which are used for detection in the test, wherein the binding sites are linked

by at least one soluble carrier substance and the conjugate is a product of a
synthetic or recombinant production and the amount used is exactly known.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a peptide, a
peptide derivative or a peptide mimetic is used as the binding site.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the peptide has
a length of at least four amino acids or the peptide derivative or the peptide

mimetic has a length corresponding to at least four amino acids.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the peptide has
a length of 4 - 20 amino acids or the peptide derivative or the peptide

mimetic has a length corresponding to 4 - 20 amino acids.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 4, 
characterized in that

the conjugate contains 2 - 50 binding sites.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 5, 
characterized in that

the binding sites bind specifically to an analyte-specific paratope of an
antibody or of an antibody fragment that is used as a receptor in the test.
Use of a calibrator as claimed in one of the claims 1 - 6, 
characterized in that

the aqueous solution additionally contains other auxiliary substances such as
buffers and stabilizers. 
Use of a calibrator as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it comprises at
least two different peptides selected from a group of peptides having the

amino acid sequence of the sequence protocols SEQ ID NO. 1 - 10 as binding
sites in a test for the detection of troponin T.
Method for the detection of an analyte in a sample by binding the analyte to
at least two specific receptors and detecting the complex that is formed as a

measure of the content of analyte in the sample, 
characterized in that
a) in a first step a known amount of a conjugate comprising in each case at
least two identical binding sites which bind to two different receptors

that specifically bind to the analyte-specific binding region of the said
receptors which are used for detection in the test wherein the binding

sites are linked by at least one soluble carrier substance and the
conjugate which is a product of a synthetic or recombinant production,

is bound to the analyte-specific receptors instead of the sample,
b) the complex formed between the conjugate and receptor is determined,
c) the result of the measurement from step b) is used to plot a calibration
curve,
d) the analyte is detected in the sample and the analyte concentration is
determined by comparing the measured signal with the calibration

curve obtained from c).
Liquid-stable synthetic calibrator for use in a test for detecting an analyte,

characterized in that
 it contains a conjugate comprising at least two identical
binding sites which bind specifically to a first receptor and at least two

identical binding sites which bind specifically to a second receptor wherein
the binding sites are linked by at least one soluble carrier substance and the

conjugate is a product of a synthetic or recombinant production wherein the
two receptors do not compete or do not significantly compete for the same

binding site.
