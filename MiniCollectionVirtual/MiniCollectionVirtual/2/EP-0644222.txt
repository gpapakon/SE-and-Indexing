<ABSTRACT>
Organopolysiloxanes containing at least one terminal and/or pendant group of the formula 
<

>
 and at least one acrylate group bonded to this group via a bridge, obtainable by hydrosilylation of organopolysiloxanes containing at least one SiH group by means of compounds containing at least two acrylate groups, in equimolar amounts at temperatures of from 60 to 130 DEG C in the presence of rhodium catalysts. The rhodium catalysts cause a 1,2-addition to take place in an addition reaction of polyacrylates with hydrosiloxanes.

<CLAIMS>
Organopolysiloxanes having terminally and/or
laterally at least one group of the formula



and/or


and, attached to this group by way of a bridging link, at
least one acrylate group, obtainable by hydrosilylation

of organopolysiloxanes having at least one SiH group with
compounds having at least two acrylate groups in equimolar

amounts at temperatures from 60 to 130Â°C in the
presence of rhodium catalysts.
Organopolysiloxanes according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the hydrosilylation is carried out with

hydridopolysiloxanes of the general formula

 
in which the radicals


R

are identical or different and are alkyl radicals
having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or phenyl radicals, but

at least 90% of the radicals R
1
 are methyl radicals,

and the radicals

R
2
have the meaning of the radicals R
1
 or are hydrogens,
but at least one radical R
2
 is a hydrogen,

and the indices

a
have an average value from 0 to 100 and
b
have an average value from 0 to 5.
Organopolysiloxanes according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that, as compounds containing acrylate

groups, esters of acrylic acid with dihydric to hexahydric
aliphatic straight-chain or branched alcohols are

reacted in an addition reaction with the SiH group(s) of
the organopolysiloxane.
Organopolysiloxanes according to Claim 3, characterized
in that, as compounds containing acrylate groups,

1,6-hexanediol acrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate,
tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol

diacrylate, glycerol triacrylate, trimethylolpropane
triacrylate or pentaerythritol tetraacrylate are reacted

in an addition reaction with the organopolysiloxane.

the preceding claims, characterized in that the hydrosilylation

is carried out in the presence of rhodium
catalysts which are selected from the group consisting of
