<ABSTRACT>
Permanent coupling between an output shaft (1) and an input shaft, consisting of a coupling element (2) which consists of a cup-shaped part (3) and a shaft stub (4) with a pinion (5), the shaft stub being connected integrally to the base of the cup and extending the latter axially. In this arrangement, the end of the inner contour of the cup-shaped part (3) is provided with a conical taper, a circumferentially conical sleeve (6) is pushed onto the output shaft (1) and the cup-shaped part (3) is connected to the output shaft (1) by thermal joining.

A permanent coupling between a drive shaft (1) and a 
driven shaft, which at its end facing the drive shaft (1) 

comprises a cylindrically constructed hollow shaft-like 
coupling element (2) and in which a circumferentially 

conical sleeve (6) is secured to the drive shaft (1) by 
clamping, characterised by the following features: 


a) the coupling element (2) comprises a cup-shaped part (3) 
and a shaft stump (4) connected to the base of the cup-shaped 

part, 
b) the open end of the inner contour of the cup-shaped part 
(3) is bevelled conically in order to receive the sleeve 

(6), 
c) for adapting the coupling to different outer shaft 
diameters, the sleeve (6) comprises a central bore which is 

adapted to said outer diameter in each case, whilst the 
outer cone of the sleeve remains unchanged. 
A permanent coupling according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the cup-shaped part (3) is connected 

to the drive shaft (1) by thermal joining with the 
interposition of the conical sleeve (6).
