<ABSTRACT>
The vibration control device is equipped in the rotating 
machine in which a primary yoke (11) is provided within a hollow 

space of a secondary yoke (12) so that the secondary yoke rotates 
about a shaft (1) inserted through the primary yoke. The 

vibration control device (10) comprises a plurality of 
electromagnet portions (11₁-11₈,13₁-13₈) arranged 

around a 
peripheral surface of the primary yoke, a pair of sensors (14x,14y) 

and a control portion (15). As the electromagnet portions, 
there are at least provided a pair of first and second 

(13₃,13₄,13₇,13₈) 
electromagnet portions and another pair of third and fourth 

(13₁,13₂,13₅,13₆) 
electro
magnet portions. The first electromagnet portion 
(13₃,13₄) is 

arranged opposite to the second electromagnet portion 
(13₇,13₈) with 

respect to an X-axis direction, while the third electromagnet 
portion (13₁,13₂) is arranged opposite to the fourth 

electromagnet portion (13₅,13₆) 
with respect to a Y-axis direction. One sensor (14x) detects a 

positional displacement between the primary (11) and secondary yokes 
(12) with respect to the X-axis direction, while another sensor (14y) 

detects a positional displacement between the primary (11) and 
secondary yokes (12) with respect to the Y-axis direction. Herein, 

the positional displacement detected by one sensor (14x) is controlled 
to be reduced by controlling electric currents supplied to the 

first (13₃,13₄) and second electromagnet (13₇,13₈) 
portions, while the positional 

displacement detected by another sensor (14y) is controlled to be 
reduced by controlling electric currents supplied to the third 

(13₁,13₂) 
and fourth (13₅,13₆) electromagnet portions. By 

electromagnetically 
controlling the positional displacement between the primary (11) and 

secondary yokes (12) with respect to each of the axial directions, the 
vibration of the shaft (1) is eventually reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration control device
which is suitable for use in a rotating machine such as a high-speed
motor employed in textile machinery and the like.FIG. 1 is a sectional view illustrating a mechanical
structure of a high-speed motor which has a general construction
of the motor conventionally known and is especially used in
textile machines.The motor shown in FIG. 1 is a so-called outer-rotor motor,
in which a roller 2 having a hollow-cylinder-like shape rotates
about a shaft 1 whose both ends are securely fixed. The
roller 2 is mounted on the shaft 1 by means of bearings 3 at
both sides thereof such that the roller 2 can freely rotate about
the shaft 1.A rotor core 5 is attached to an interior surface of the
roller 2 through a magnet 4, while a stator core 6 is attached to
the shaft 1 to face the rotor core 5 across an air gap.
Upon the receipt of electric currents carried from a cable 7
which is introduced to the stator core 6 through a hollow portion
of the shaft 1, a rotating magnetic field is produced around the
stator core 6.In short, the above-mentioned magnet 4, the rotor core 5 and
the stator core 6 are assembled together to form a synchronous
induction motor. Instead of the synchronous induction motor, it
is possible to employ an induction motor. In the synchronous
induction motor described above, the roller 2 rotates about the
shaft 1. By pressing a bobbin winder against a peripheral face 
of the roller 2 which is rotating about the shaft 1, yarn is
wound up.Thus, the peripheral velocity of the rotating roller 2,
is roughly proportional to the winding speed of the
yarn.It is desired to raise the
winding speed of the yarn for an improvement of the productivity
in the textile industries. For this reason, a higher peripheral
velocity is required for the roller 2. For example, the
peripheral velocity of 6,000 [m/min] or so is required for the
roller 2. In order to achieve such high peripheral velocity,
there are provided two methods as follows:
1 ○ to enlarge an outer diameter of the roller 2;
and2 ○ to increase the number of revolution of the
roller 2.The first method raises a new problem in that the size
of the roller 2 must be enlarged as well as another problem that
a higher precision is required for the bearing 3 to
respond to an increase of the weight of the roller 2.Therefore, the second method is conventionally employed. In
addition, in this method the diameter of the shaft 1 is reduced as well. Thus,
it is possible to use a bearing which has a smaller
