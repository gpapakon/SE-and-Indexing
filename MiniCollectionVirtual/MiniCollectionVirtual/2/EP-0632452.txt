<ABSTRACT>
A tape cartridge of the two-way system includes 
large-sized and small-sized tape cartridges each housing a 

memory element having a set of terminals for electric connection 
with corresponding terminals in a video tape player. The 

level at which the terminals of the memory element in the 
large-sized tape cartridge are installed and the level at which 

the terminals of the memory element in the small-sized tape 
cartridge are installed are defined at the same level spaced 

from a longitudinal mid center line of the length of magnetic 
tape intermediate of the width thereof or a reference plane in 

which a reel support lies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a two-way
system comprising a large-sized tape cartridge and a small-sized
tape cartridge each including a reeled length of magnetic
recording tape of the same width and employing the same data
memory element.A tape cartridge such as, for example, a 8-mm video
tape cartridge or a VHS video tape cartridge, in which a memory
element for storage of such data associated with recording as
recording mode, recorded voice data and/or preset parameters
has been well known in the art. Such a tape cartridge is
disclosed in, for example, the Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications
JP-A-63-166085, published July 7, 1988, and JP-A-63-164085,
published July 9, 1988. According to these patent
publications, terminals of the memory element are exposed to
the outside of the cartridge casing so that, when the tape
cartridge is loaded in a video tape player, the terminals of
the memory element can be automatically connected electrically
with corresponding terminals disposed in the video tape player. These tape cartridges and the arrangement of the
terminals or the memory element are only designed for
one specific size of the cartridge. The problem how to
arrange the memory element for different sized
cartridges is not addressed.The patents US-A-4 743 984 reflecting the preamble of claim 1 and JP-A-61 094 287 disclose
tape cartridges of different sizes namely in length and width
having information carrier elements located between the two
wheels and the front side of the cartridge. The information
carrier elements are arranged such that the information
carrier elements are located at the same position in a plane
normal to the axis of rotation of the wheels for all sizes
of cartridges. The information is read out with optical
detection means sensing probes of a sensing mechanism.As a tape cartridge for use with this type of video tape
player, a two-way system has been suggested which includes
a small-sized tape cartridge which is designed so compact as
to 
enable it to be used outdoors, and a large-sized tape cartridge
of a stay-at-home model for long-time use at home.In the large-sized and small-sized tape cartridges of
the two-way system, since the length of magnetic recording tape
of the same width is employed to secure a compatibility, the
both are generally set to have an equal thickness.However, in terms of the physical strength of the
casing and securement of closure of reel holes, it is preferred
that the large-sized tape cartridge is set to have a greater
thickness than that of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A two-way system including a large-sized tape cartridge
(C1) and a small-sized tape cartridge (C2),

each tape cartridge (C1,C2) comprising a substantially
rectangular box-like casing (1A;1B) including

a pair of reels (3,3) housed therein, a length of
magnetic tape (2) having opposite ends anchored to

the respective reels (3,3) and an information carrier
element housed therein, said casing (1A;1B) also

including a front wall, a rear wall opposite to the
front wall and opposite side walls lying perpendicular

to any one of the front and rear walls, wherein
the heightwise dimensions of the casings (lA;lB)

being different from each other while the lengths of
magnetic tape (2) have respective widths equal to

each other, and each information carrier element
comprising a memory element (25) having a set of

terminals (26), said memory element (25) being accommodated
within the casing (1A;1B) with the set of

terminals (26) exposed to the outside of the casing
(1A;1B),
characterized in that

border lines of said memory element (25) are located
at a heightwise location spaced a predetermined distance

from the level at which a longitudinal mid-center
line (X) of the length of magnetic tape (2)

which runs between the reels (3,3) lies or from the
level (Y) at which a surface of a reel support (Z)

which supports any one of the reels (3) from below
lies, so that the position of the memory element

(25) is defined in a heightwise position, wherein 
said predetermined distances of the memory elements

(25) are equal to each other.
The two-way system as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the casing (1A;1B) has an opening (29) defined

therein through which the set of terminals (26) of
the memory element (25) are exposed to the outside,

said opening (29) having a width, as measured in a
direction widthwise of the cartridge (1A;1B) which

is smaller than the width of the memory element
(25).
The two-way system as claimed in one of claims 1 or
2, wherein the set of terminals (26) of the memory

element (25) in the casing (1A;1B) are exposed to
the outside of the casing (1A;1B) in part through

one of adjoining wall faces of the casing (1A;1B)
and in part through the other of adjoining wall faces

of the casing (1A;1B).
The two-way system as claimed in one of claims 1-3,
further comprising elastic means (30;31) housed

within the casing (1A;1B) for biasing the memory
element (25) towards an opening (29) defined in the

casing (1A;1B).
