<ABSTRACT>
In a Li/LiMn2O4 secondary element of the "rocking chair cells" type (SWING system), the positive electrode is a metal-mesh-reinforced rolling electrode and the negative electrode is formed by impregnation of a nickel foam with a paste consisting of lithium-intercalating graphite. Such electrodes are produced to be 3 to 4 times thicker than thin-film electrodes which are inserted into wound cells and are produced using the doctor-blade technique, for which reason they are particularly suitable for the construction of prismatic cells. By prerolling the nickel foam, which is still empty, to specific thicknesses, the surface capacity of the negative electrode can be matched to that of the positive roller electrode. After subsequent rolling of the impregnated nickel foam, an optimum energy density and a load capacity of the electrode are achieved with a porosity of 50 to 60%.
