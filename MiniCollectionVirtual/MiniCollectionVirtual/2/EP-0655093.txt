<ABSTRACT>
In a process and with a device for magazining cans, filled cans removed from the magazine are replaced by empty cans. To load on or remove the cans, the magazine is moved. An empty space for a can, an empty can or a full can is advanced to a can-gripper. The device as per the invention is a carriage (10) with a magazine. Empty and/or full cans (1, 2) are arranged on the carriage in such a way that the empty cans (1) are placed at one end of the carriage (10). The full cans are placed at the other end of the carriage (10).

occupied between the full and the empty cans on the magazine, a can-conveying

carriage is positioned on the magazine, an empty can is delivered
from the carriage to the magazine on the vacant can stand, a f ull

can is delivered from the magazine to the vehicle, and the magazine is
displaced by one can division in the direction of the stands for the empty

cans, so that a vacant can stand is again present on the magazine at the
ori
ginal position relative to the can-conveying carriage.

 a can-conveying
carriage with a vacant can stand and an empty can is positioned on the

magazine, a full can is delivered from the magazine to the carriage, the
magazine or the can-conveying carriage is displaced by one can stand,

so that the empty can of the can-conveying carriage is opposite the can
stand just emptied on the magazine, the empty can is delivered to the

magazine from the can-conveying carriage, and the magazine is displaced
when necessary by one can division again contrary to the previously

displaced direction thereof (Figs. 7a to 7c).
