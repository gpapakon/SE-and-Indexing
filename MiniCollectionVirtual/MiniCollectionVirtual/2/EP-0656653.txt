<ABSTRACT>
Shallow junctions n- and p-channel field effect transistors are formed 
with a single ion implant into a conformal tungsten silicide layer (e.g., 13). 

Although phosphorus and boron are implanted into the same silicide regions, the 
phosphorus prevents the boron from outdiffusing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of field effect transistors and 
particularly to such transistors formed by dopant diffusion from a silicide layer. As integrated circuits have become more complex, the individual 
devices, such as field effect transistors, forming the integrated circuits have become 
smaller and more closely spaced to each other. Simple shrinkage of device 
dimensions was not sufficient to permit the increased complexity of the new circuits; 
new processing technologies and innovative devices were also required. An example will illustrate the point. The source and drain regions of the 
field effect transistor must be separately electrically contacted. This is frequently 
done by depositing a dielectric layer over the transistor, patterning the dielectric 
layer to form windows which expose portions of the source/drain regions, and then 
depositing metal in the windows. A typical metal is aluminum. However, aluminum 
tends to diffuse or spike into the silicon substrate. Such diffusion is undesirable. 
Diffusion barrier layers are deposited to prevent such spiking. Deposition of the 
barrier layer material into windows frequently results in poor coverage near the 
bottoms of the windows. Of course, the dielectric windows must be accurately 
positioned with respect to the source/drain regions. An innovative design which decreases the alignment accuracy required 
for the dielectric windows is described in United States Patents 4,844,776 and 
4,922,311 issued to K.-H. Lee, C.-Y. Lu and D Yaney. These patents describe both a 
device and a method for making the device which is termed a folded extended 
window field effect transistor and is commonly referred to by the acronym 
FEWMOS. In an exemplary embodiment, a layer of a conducting material, such as 
TiN, is blanket deposited after transistor elements, including an insulating layer on 
top of the gate electrode, are formed. The conducting layer is patterned to form 
window or landing pads which cover at least portions of the source/drain regions. 
The window pads may be larger than the source/drain regions provided that they do 
not contact each other on top of the gate electrode; they may also extend onto the 
field oxide regions adjacent the source/drain regions. The window pads act as etch 
stop layers when the windows in the dielectric are etched thereby preventing etching 
into the source/drain regions.  Dopants must be put into the substrate to form the source/drain regions. 
This is frequently done by ion implantation.

A method of making an integrated circuit comprising at least one n-channel 
field effect transistor and at least one p-channel transistor comprising the 

steps of: 
   forming regions (e.g., 3, 5) of first and second conductivity types in a 

substrate; 
   fabricating gate structures (e.g., 9, 11) of at least one first and at least 

one second field effect transistors; at least one of said at least one first and at least 
one of said at least one second field effect transistors being in said regions (e.g., 3, 5)

said dopant implant layer on the said regions (e.g., 3, 5) of first and second 

conductivity types;
