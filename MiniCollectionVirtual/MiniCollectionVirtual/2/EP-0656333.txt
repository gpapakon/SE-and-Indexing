<ABSTRACT>
A polysaccharide derivative is immobilized on a carrier such as silicagel by cross-linking only the derivatives 
with each other by using a polyfunctional cross-linking agent. The optical isomer separating agent thus obtained is 

excellent in solvent resistance and is most suitable for use in optical resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separating
agent for optical isomers and a process for producing
the same. More particularly, it relates to a
separating agent, which is obtained by crosslinking
polysaccharide derivative molecules exclusively among
themselves on a support and useful as an optical
resolution reagent for racemic modifications, and a
process for producing the same.It is known that a column packing composed of
silica gel having a polysaccharide derivative
supported thereon is useful as a separating agent for
optical isomers of a racemic modification (Y. Okamoto,
M. Kawashima and K. Hatada, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 106,
p.5357, 1984). However, such a separating agent is
poor in solvent resistance since it comprises silica
gel having a polysaccharide derivative which is
supported on the silica gel simply by coating alone. 
When the separating agent is used as a column packing
for liquid chromatography, therefore, some eluents
cannot be used.Accordingly, a separating agent which is composed
of a support having a polysaccharide derivative being
supported thereon and has an excellent solvent
resistance has been required.EP-A-0281951 discloses the use of optically active
polysaccharide derivatives insolubilized by crosslinking
for separating racemic mixtures.The present inventors have conducted extensive
studies on a separating agent whereby the above-mentioned
problems can be solved without deteriorating
the excellent characteristics of a polysaccharide
derivative and, as a result, completed the present
invention. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a
separating agent for optical isomers characterized by
being composed of a polysaccharide derivative which
has been immobilized on a support by crosslinking, on
said support, the polysaccharide derivative molecules
with the use of a polyfunctional crosslinking agent
which does not form a link between said support and
said polysaccharide derivative molecules (i.e. the
polysaccharide derivative molecules are crosslinked
exclusively among themselves), and wherein the surface
of said support has been inactivated prior to said
crosslinking reaction in order to prevent the surface
of said support from reacting with said crosslinking
agent.In a second aspect, the present invention provides a
process for producing a separating agent for optical
isomers as specified above characterized by crosslinking,
on a support, polysaccharide derivative molecules with
the use of a polyfunctional crosslinking agent which
does not form a link between said
