<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel estradiol 
derivative-alkylating agent conjugate with reduced hormonal 
activity, a process for preparing the conjugate, compounds 
useful for the preparation of the conjugate, and a growth 
inhibiting composition containing the conjugate or estradiol 
derivative. Among the conventional alkylating agents, although 
having a strong antitumor activity, there are many agents 
which fail to display their full medicinal effects. The 
primary reason is their limited dosage due to their 
undesirable side effects in medicinal use. A solution to 
this problem is to combine the alkylating agent with a 
carrier having a specific affinity for the site of tumor to 
form an alkylating agent-carrier conjugate. It is intended 
to let the alkylating agent accumulate specifically at the 
site of tumor so that the agent will exhibit its antitumor 
activity effectively while suppressing the occurrence of the 
undesirable side effects. Based on this conception, a proposal has been made on 
preparation of an estradiol-chlorambucil conjugate using 
estradiol as carrier and an antitumor agent containing the  
 
conjugate as principal constituent (Japanese Patent 
Publication (KOKOKU) No. 58-10397 (1983)). This antitumor 
agent specifically accumulates at the site of tumor and 
exhibits a strong antitumor activity. Further, it gives 
almost no significant influence to the normal cells. However, an antitumor agent is usually required to be 
administered over a long period of time, so that even a 
slight side effect which is quite insignificant in short-term 
administration may give rise to a serious problem in 
long-time administration of the such agent. Especially, 
accumulation of the slight side effect may be remarkable as 
the physical strength of the cancer patient is usually 
weakened. In the case of the estradiol-chlorambucil conjugate, in 
long-time administration thereof, there is observed in some 
cases development of the same symptoms as seen in 
administration of estrogen. The studies by the present inventors have disclosed 
that development of such symptoms is due to the action of 
estrogen which is released in small quantities from the 
estradiol-chlorambucil conjugate in the patient's body. It 
is thus considered that in long-time administration of this 
conjugate, estrogen released in small quantities therefrom 
is accumulated in some cases to such an extent as to induce 
its side effects. Further, the present inventors have found that when a 
specific substitutent, for
