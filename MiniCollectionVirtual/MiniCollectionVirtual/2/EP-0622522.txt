<ABSTRACT>
A stage valve with particular use in cementing a 
wellbore annulus above an inflatable packer located in 

a wellbore on a liner where the stage valve has 
pressure operated outer sleeve members (20,22) for opening a 

flow port (30) in the stage valve and an inner sleeve 
member (50) actuated by the trailing plug behind a liquid 

cement slurry to close the flow port whereupon spring 
members act on at least one of the outer sleeve 

members to close off the flow port on the exterior of 
the stage valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a valve apparatus and to methods for cementing a wellbore.In oil well completions, it is common to line the
borehole with a tubular metal liner and to cement the
annulus between the liner and the borehole by injecting a
liquid cement slurry under pressure through the bottom end
of the liner into the annulus between the liner and the
wellbore. The liquid slurry is moved up the annulus
between the liner and the wellbore under pressure and
subsequently sets up in the annulus to support the liner in
the well bore. There are limitations as to the length or
height of a column of cement which can be pumped into a
well annulus. Where the length of the liquid cement column
in an annulus is too long it is not uncommon to insert a
stage cementing collar along the length of the liner. In
this instance, a liquid cement slurry is first located
between the end of the liner, and the stage collar. Next,
the stage collar is opened and liquid cement slurry is
injected into the annulus located above the stage collar.
After cementing the upper annulus above the stage collar,
the stage collar is closed off to prevent a return flow of
the liquid slurry into the bore of the liner.In other completion techniques, an inflatable well
packer is disposed in a wellbore on a liner where an
inflation liquid is utilized to inflate an elastomer
element on the packer and where the elastomer element seals
off the annulus of the wellbore. In some instances, it is
desirable to have a stage valve above the inflatable packer 
so that cement can be introduced into the upper annulus
between the liner and the wellbore above the inflatable
packer.Stage valves require the ability to remain closed
during an initial operations and to be opened only at an
appropriate time and to be closed securely at the end of an
appropriate time. Stage valves typically include sliding
sleeves and latches for retaining the sleeves in one
position or another. The sleeves and latches can be
mechanically activated or hydraulically activated.
However, as with all downhole tools, it is always a problem
to determine whether or not a stage collar has safely and
reliably performed its function in the wellbore. It is
also a problem if the stage valve fails to remain closed.In most types of cementing operations it is also
common to leave cement in the liner which has to be drilled
out. Thus, if cementing can be accomplished without
leaving cement in the liner, there are substantial economic
benefits to the operator.U. S. Patent 4,655,286 issued April
