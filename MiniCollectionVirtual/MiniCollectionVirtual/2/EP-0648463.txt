A manufacturing method is described of a dish-washing machine basket. 
The main characteristic of the described method consists in the fact that 

the basket is obtained by joining a base section (1), realised by way of 
expensive tools and being the same for all models of machine, and a 

variable additional part (2,3), being different according to the model

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a basket for a dish-washing machine 
and to a manufacturing method thereof. It is known that dish-washing machines normally use two extractable 
dish holding baskets. Said baskets are usually realised starting from a net of large metallic 
wires welded perpendicularly to each other so as to form a rectangle; 
the four edges of the rectangle are then folded upwards in order to form 
the side walls of the basket. The baskets are then completed by welding so as to join the four side 
walls together. If necessary the basket is completed by welding where appropriate 
other pieces of wire for the realisation of partitions or supports for the 
dishes; finally the basket is finished by covering in a known way the 
metallic wires with a layer of suitable plastic material. Baskets obtained in this way are quite functional, even though the 
addition of certain possibilities could be useful, such as a container for 
small articles, such as coffee spoons, that could otherwise slide through 
spaces in the netting; moreover these are not very attractive and are all 
practically of the same appearance; on the other hand differentiating 
them passing from one model or a line of models requires variants in 
the tools used (those actually used for manufacturing such baskets are  
 
very expensive). The aim of the present invention is that of indicating how it is possible 
to realise a basket for dish-washing machines and a method for it's 
manufacture that, even with contained costs, allows for a greater 
possibility of aesthetic and/or functional design and simplifies the 
diversification of models. For reaching such aims the present invention has as it's subject a 
method of manufacture of a basket for a dish-washing machine, 
characterised in that the basket is obtained by joining a base section, 
realised with expensive tools being the same for all models of machine, 
and a variable additional part, being different according to the model or 
line of models, the likes of which is realised without the necessity of 
expensive tools. In particular the present invention has as it's subject a basket for dish-washing 
machines, realised with metallic net, characterised in that said 
basket provides a frontal section in a plastic material for improving the 
aesthetics and/or the functioning of the said basket. Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention shall 
result in being clear from the following description and annexed 
drawings, supplied purely as an explanatory and

<CLAIMS>
Manufacturing method of a basket for a dish-washing machine, 
characterised in that the basket is obtained by joining a base section (1), 

realised by way of expensive tools and being the same for all models of 
machine, and a variable additional part (2,3), different according to the 

model or line of models, which is realised without the necessity of 
expensive tools. 
Basket for dish-washing machine, realised according to the method of 
claim 1, characterised in that said basket (1) has a part realised in 

metallic net and a frontal section (2) realised in a plastic material for 
improving the aesthetics and/or functioning of the basket itself. 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claim 2, characterised 
in that said basket (1) has a rear head (3) in a plastic material. 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that said frontal section (2) provides a handle (6) and 

that said handle (6) is realised by practising a slot or projection on said 
frontal section (2). 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that said frontal section (2) provides a container (7) for 

small objects, in particular tea spoons, said container (7) being in 
particular realised in the internal part of said frontal section (2). 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that said frontal section (2) and/or said rear head (3) 

provide apertures for the passage of water so as not to obstruct the flow 
of such water during the washing of the dishes. 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that for reducing the cost of such basket (1), and/or for 

facilitating the assembly, in the application area of said frontal section 
(2) and/or said rear head (3), the metallic structure is reduced (fig. 2). 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that said frontal sec
tion (2) and/or said rear head (3) 
are snap fitted to said basket (1). 
Basket for dish-washing machine, according to claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that said frontal section (2) and/or said rear head (3) 

comprise sliding wheels (8) and in particular said wheels result in being 
partially hidden from view (fig. 7). 
Manufacturing method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said variable additional part (2,3), is realised in a plastic material. 
Manufacturing method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said variable additional part (2,3), is realised in a metallic material. 
Manufacturing method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said variable additional part (2,3), has ornamental or commercial 

motives being specific to one or more models. 
Basket for dish-washing machine realised utilising the 
manufacturing method according to one or more of the previous claims.
