<ABSTRACT>
A drive is proposed which serves to adjust components, such as e.g. vehicle seats, sliding roofs, sliding windows etc., which belong to a motor vehicle. The positioning drive comprises an electrical drive motor and a transmission which is assigned downstream thereof and whose power output element is operatively connected to a component of a motor vehicle which is to be adjusted. A particularly lightweight and cost-effective positioning drive is obtained if the transmission has a multi-component housing which is manufactured from plastic and in whose wall at least one transmission component which transmits the actuation movement and is produced from plastic is directly mounted without the arrangement of special bearing elements.

<CLAIMS>
Seat adjustment device having an electric drive
motor (12) and a worm gear (18) which is connected

downstream of the latter and whose gear worm (56) meshes
with a worm wheel (54) which consists of plastic and is

coupled to an output element (20) which is operationally
connected to a component (22) to be adjusted on a motor

vehicle seat, and having a multipartite gearbox housing
(28) and in whose wall the worm wheel (36) transmitting

the actuating movement is radially mounted directly and
without the arrangement of special bearing elements, as

is the gear worm,

the worm wheel (54) of the worm gear being constructed

   as a threaded sleeve (36), which is produced from
plastic, with an internal nut thread (52), and

the output element being constructed as a spindle
(20) which is fixed in terms of rotation and

longitudinally displaceable and which can be
screwed with its screw thread (60) through the nut

thread (52), 
characterized in that
 the gearbox
housing is produced from plastic and the gear worm

(56) consists of a carbon fibre filled plastic and
is rotatably mounted directly in the wall of the

gearbox housing.
Actuator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the worm wheel (54) consists of a glass fibre
filled plastic.
Actuator according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the gearbox housing (30, 
32) is produced from a glass fibre filled plastic.
