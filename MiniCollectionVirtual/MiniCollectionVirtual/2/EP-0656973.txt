<ABSTRACT>
A method in which a plasma arc torch (16) is used to vitrify and remediate a site containing municipal waste (12), contaminated soils, resulting from a hazardous material deposit or spill, or contaminated buried objects. The process steps of a first preferred embodiment involve drilling a series of holes into the waste material mass at proper spacing, inserting and operating a plasma arc torch (16) in each drilled hole to pyrolize, remediate and vitrify the waste materials and allowing the melted materials to cool and harden. During the process, a gaseous by-product (36) is produced and collected in a hood which is attached to scrubbing and chemical cleaning apparatus (38). The resultant gases are commercially useful as fuel gas and the vitrified residue (14) is significantly smaller in volume than the original waste material volume, thus substantially extending the useful life of the landfill sites and ultimately providing a firm foundation for construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed relates to the field of
remediation and vitrification of waste materials including
soils containing hazardous materials and residential and
industrial waste as found in a landfill site.The present invention provides a method
adapted to apply a high temperature plasma arc flame to
remediate, vitrify and decontaminate various types of
waste.A first embodiment of the invention is concerned with
the need to increase the capacity and safety for disposing
of residential and industrial wastes. This problem
relates to public dumping facilities, generally known as
landfill sites. Everyone generates waste, and yet no one
wants to have a waste disposal site or a waste incinerator
nearby. The reasons for this public dislike of waste
disposal facilities ranges from airborne toxic hazards, to
leaching of dangerous chemicals into the groundwater, to
unpleasant odors and to reduction in real estate values.Despite this generally held dislike for landfills,
the need for more waste disposal capacity keeps growing.
We produce more waste each year and the existing landfills
are rapidly approaching the point of being filled to
capacity. The problem encompasses residential waste such
as bio-degradable and non-biodegradable garbage and
industrial waste including scrap materials, chemical
residues, sludge, mill tailings, and other forms of waste,
some of which may be hazardous, toxic or radioactive.
Common municipal solid waste is being generated at the 
rate of over 200 million tons per year. Over ninety
percent (90%) of this waste is deposited in landfills.
Efforts at recycling, while helpful, fall far short of
coping with the problem.A typical landfill contains a great variety of
materials, only a small number of which will decompose
naturally. A weight analysis of landfill components by
category indicates paper products (41%), glass and metal
(16.9%), plastics (6.5%), rubber and textiles (4.3%), yard
waste (17.9%), wood (3.7%) and food (7.9%).The process of incineration deals somewhat with the
capacity problem, but it simultaneously creates other
problems, such as pollution, odors, acid rain, depletion
of fuels, etc. Incineration, by its nature, is a
combustion process and, therefore, generates a number of
gaseous products which range from unpleasant to dangerous.Another serious contemporary problem addressed by a
second preferred embodiment is the accidental spilling or
intentional discarding of toxic or environmentally
hazardous materials comprising both organic and inorganic
contaminants. These

A method of treating waste material (12) in-situ, comprising the steps of:

a) forming a borehole (30) to a predetermined depth in said waste material (12);
b) inserting a plasma arc torch (16) into the borehole (30);
c) energising the plasma arc torch (16) to pyrolyse and vitrify waste material (12) in its
vicinity;
d) de-energising the plasma arc torch;
e) removing the plasma arc torch from the borehole; and
f) allowing said molten waste material to cool and solidify thereby to produce a vitrified
residue substantially less in volume than the waste matenal from which it was produced.
A method according to claim 1, wherein step (b) includes suspending the plasma
torch (16) at a location above and proximate the lower end of the borehole (30).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the waste material (12)
comprises dumped residential and industrial waste products.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said waste material (12)
compnses soil contaminated by toxic matenal dumped thereon.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the borehole (30) is formed to
a depth at least equal to the depth of the waste matenal (12).
A method according to any preceding claim, including the step of inserting a heat

A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the borehole (30) is formed as
an initial hole and the method further comprises the steps of lowering, operating, and

raising the torch (16) to determine from the initial hole the effective diameter of remediated
