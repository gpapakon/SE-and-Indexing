<ABSTRACT>
A multiple lever connector assembly includes a 
plurality of male and female connector housings (111, 114) 

accommodating terminals, a plurality of pairs of lever 
support shafts (119) each of which pairs protrude from side 

walls of each male connector housing (111) respectively, a 
plurality of operating levers (120) each having two bearing 

holes (121) into which the lever support shafts (119) of 
each male connector housing (111) are fitted, so that the 

operating levers (120) are rotatably mounted on the male 
connector housings (111) respectively, a plurality of cam 

action sections (116) formed on the female connector 
housings (114) respectively for displacing the male and 

female connector housings (111, 114) by the cam action of 
the operating levers (120) so that the male and female 

connector housings (111, 114) are mated together and 
unmated, and a coupling member (127) coupling the male 

connector housings (111) to one another so that they 
arranged side by side with a predetermined clearance between 

one of the side walls of each male connector housing (111) 
and one of the side walls of the adjacent male connector 

housing (111) opposite the one of the side walls of each 
first connector housing (111). The clearance is set so as 

to be smaller than a depth of fit between the lever support 
shafts (119) and the respective bearing holes (121) of the 

operating levers (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lever connector having an
operating lever which is operated so that male and female
connectors are mated together and unmated from each other
utilizing the principles of the lever, and more particularly
to a multiple lever connector assembly according to the preamble of
claim 1.A multiple lever connector assembly having a plurality
of connector housings integrally coupled to one another side
by side has recently been provided. For example, Fig. 8
shows a twin lever connector assembly. Two male connector
housings 1 are integrally coupled to each other so as to be
arranged right and left in parallel with each other. Each
male connector housing 1 has two lever support shafts 2
protruding from right-hand and left-hand side walls thereof
respectively. A gate-shaped operating lever 3 having two
cam grooves is rotatably mounted on the lever support shafts
2 of each male connector housing 1 so as to straddle the
same. Each male connector housing 1 has two outer walls
formed integrally therewith to be located outside both sides
of the operating lever 3 respectively. The outer walls 4
restrict the movement of the lever 3 so that it can be
prevented from being disconnected from the lever support
shafts 2 when rotatively moved.In the assembling of the above-described multiple lever
connector assembly, the operating lever 3 is mounted on the 
connector housing 1 by inserting the lever support shafts 2
into shaft holes 3a thereof respectively. Each leg of the
operating lever 3 is expanded outwardly by the length of
each lever support shaft 2 when the lever support shafts 2
of the connector housing 1 are inserted into the respective
shaft holes 3a. Accordingly, the outer walls 4 are pushed
by the respective legs of the operating lever 3 to be
thereby expanded outwardly.Since the outer walls 4 are located at both sides of
each male connector housing 1 in the above-described
conventional construction, the two male connector housings 1
are coupled together with a space allowing elastic
deformation of the two outer walls 4 therebetween.
Consequently, the lateral dimension of the multiple lever
connector assembly is increased, which poses a problem.The present invention has been made in view of the
above-described problem and an object of the present
invention is to provide a multiple lever connector assembly
wherein the overall lateral dimension of a plurality of
connector housings coupled to one another side by side can
be reduced.To achieve the object, the present invention provides a
multiple

A multiple lever connector assembly comprising

a plurality of first connector housings (111) each having opposite side walls,
a plurality of second connector housings (114) for mating with and unmating from the
first connector housings (111) respectively,
a plurality of pairs of terminals each of which pairs are disposed in the first and second
connector housings (111, 114) respectively and are electrically connected together

when the first and second connector housings (111, 114) are mated together,
a plurality of pairs of lever support shafts (119) each of which pairs protrude from the
side walls of each first connector housing (111) respectively,
a plurality of operating levers (120) each having two bearing holes (121) into which the
lever support shafts (119) of each first connector housing (111) are fitted, so that

the operating levers (120) are rotatably mounted on the first connector housings
(111), straddling the first connector housings (111), respectively, and
a plurality of cam action sections (116) provided on the second connector housings
(114) respectively for displacing the first and second connector housings (111,

114) by the cam action of the operating levers (120) in a first direction so that the
first and second connector housings (111, 114) are mated together and in a second

direction so that the first and second connector housings (111, 114) are unmated,

characterized by
a coupling member (127) coupling the first connector housings (111) to one another so
that the first connector housings (111) are arranged side by side with a

predetermined clearance between one side wall of a leg (120a) of one operating
lever (120) fitted to a first connector housing (111) and the side wall of a leg

(120a) of one operating lever (120) fitted to the adjacent first connector housing
(111) opposite said side wall of said other leg (120a), and
in that said clearance is set so as to be smaller than a depth of fit between the lever
support shafts (119) and the respective bearing holes (121) of the operating levers

(120), such that each lever is prevented from disconnecting from its respective
housing by the adjacent lever.
A multiple lever connector assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the
first connector housings (111) coupled to one another by the coupling member (127) so

as to be arranged side by side constitute an integral connector block (112) and that the
first connector housings (111) located at opposite sides of the connector block (112)
