<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus
and a method for reading a gel electrophoresis pattern
with high sensitivity to detection of the electrophoresis
pattern without requiring any expensive device
configuration such as a special laser light source, the
gel electrophoresis pattern being obtained by subjecting
a sample containing nucleic acids or protein acids to
electrophoresis in gel and separating the sample from the
gel material.Heretofore, techniques for analysis by means of
gel electrophoresis methods have been extensively utilized
for the fragmentation and for the analysis of structures
of protein acids and nucleic acids present as a polymer
in the body of an animal or plant. The gel electrophoresis
method has the advantage that a minute amount of a sample
can be analyzed in an appropriate manner so that in many
cases the gel electrophoresis method is utilized for
experiments in which a sample can be procured in a very
limited amount. Therefore, the analysis using the gel
electrophoresis method requires a very high sensitivity
to detection of the sample.In conventional techniques, a sample to be
analyzed is first labelled with a radioactive isotope, the
labelled sample is injected into a gel, and the resulting
gel material is subjected to electrophoresis. After the
gel electrophoresis, the gel is attached to an X-ray film 
or the like for exposure to X rays to be emitted from the
radioactive isotope labelled in the sample. After exposure
of the gel material containing the labelled sample to the
X-ray film or the like for a given period of time, the X-ray
film is then developed, and the exposed pattern
resulting from the radioactive isotope transcribed onto
the X-ray film is read as a gel electrophoresis pattern
in order to analyze the structures of the proteins or
nucleic acids of the sample.The radioactive isotopes, however, are so
hazardous that they should be handled and managed with
extreme care and with high security. Recently, techniques
for handling laser light and technologies of laser light
sources, optical sensors and signal processing have
greatly developed leading to the development of fluorescence
detecting methods for detecting an electrophoresis
pattern without requiring the use of such hazardous
radioactive isotopes. The fluorescence detecting methods
comprise labelling a sample with a fluorescent substance,
subjecting the sample to electrophoresis, exciting the
labelled fluorescent substance directly with a laser light
source, and detecting the resulting fluorescent pattern,
