<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rotary piston pump for conveying and/or metering liquid or pourable media. It consists of a pump casing (2) with a cylinder chamber (4) having a cylindrical inner periphery (6) into which open at least one inlet (8) and at least out outlet (10), and a rotary piston (20) rotating inside the cylinder chamber (4) which, together with at least one region of its outer peripheral surface (22) forms a seal with the inner peripheral surface (6) of the cylinder chamber (4) and is separated in regions from the inner peripheral surface (6) by a radial stroke distance. When the rotary piston rotates (arrow 70), an expanding working chamber (24) is formed in the region of the inlet (8) to draw the medium in and, on further rotation, contracts again in the region of the outlet to force the medium out. The working chamber (24) concerned is limited, at least during its increase or decrease in volume, by at least one separating slide (26) in front of the inlet (8) or behind the outlet (10) viewed in the direction of rotation. Said slide is moved to and fro (arrow 32) in the pump casing (2), as the rotary piston (20) rotates, in a substantially radial direction to the axis of rotation (34) in such a way that it forms a seal with the outer peripheral surface (22) of the rotary piston (20). The separating slide (26) is forcibly moved by means of a drive device (30) synchronised with the rotary piston (20).

Rotary piston pump for delivering flowable or pourable 
media, in particular liquid, pasty or granular media, comprising 

a pump housing (2) with a cylinder space (4) which has a 
cylindrical inner circumferential surface (6) and into which 

there open at least one inlet (8) and at least one outlet (10), 
and also a rotary piston (20) which is mounted inside the 

cylinder space (4) so as to be rotationally drivable about an 
axis of rotation (34) coaxial with the said cylinder space and 

has an outer circumferential surface (22), the radial distance 
from the axis of rotation (34) of which varies over the 

circumference in such a way that the rotary piston (20) 
cooperates, by at least one region of the outer circumferential 

surface (22), sealingly with the inner circumferential surface 
(6) of the cylinder space (4) and in certain regions is spaced 

from the inner circumferential surface (6) by a stroke distance 

radial to the axis of rotation (34), so that on rotation of the 
rotary piston (20) a working chamber (24), increasing in volume, 

is formed in each case in the region of the inlet (8) in order 
to draw in the medium to be delivered, which working chamber then 

decreases again in volume, after continued rotation, in the 
region of the outlet (10) in order to force out the medium, the 

respective working chamber (24) being bounded, at least during 
its volume increase and decrease, by at least one separating 

slide (26) which, seen in the direction of rotation, is arranged 
before the inlet (8) and after the outlet (10) and on rotation 

of the rotary piston (20) is displaced to and fro in the pump 
housing (2) in the substantially radial direction with respect 

to the axis of rotation (34) in such a way that it always 
cooperates, by its surface (28) facing the rotary piston (20), 

sealingly with the outer circumferential surface (22) of the 
rotary piston (20), the displacement of the separating slide (26) 

being effected in constrained fashion by means of a drive device 
(30) synchronised with the rotary piston (20), characterised in
