<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of 1,8-diacetoxy-3-carboxyanthraquinone, also known as Diacerein
(I)

Diacerein is a compound possessing antiarthritic activity,
available under various trademarks, e.g. ArtrodarR (The Merck Index,
11th Ed., 1989, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahaway, N.J., USA, 2939).French Pat. No. 2,508,798-B1 and Belgian Pat. No. 875,945 disclose
the preparation of diacerein via dissolution of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone-3-carboxylic
acid in excess acetic anhydride, in the
presence of sulphuric acid as a catalyst.1.8-Dihydroxy-anthraquinone-3-carboxylic acid occurs either free or
as a glucoside in several plants, e.g. in Senna leaves. It is also
prepared from chrysophanic acid diacetate (The Merck Index, 11th
Ed., 1989, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahaway, N.J., USA, 8175 and 2263) and
by oxidating of the corresponding 3-hydroxymethyl derivative, i.e.
1.8-dihydroxy-3-hydroxymethylanthraquinone (aloe-emodin), with
chromic anhydride ("Sostanze formaceutiche", a translation into 
Italian and revision by R. Longo, OEMF, Milano, 1988, p. 596 of
"Pharmazeutische Wirkstoffe, Synthesen, Patente, Anwendungen", A.
Kleemann, J. Engel, George Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart-New York, 1982-1987).However, the diacerein obtained by means of the processes of the
prior art contains - as a by-product - considerable amounts of the
aforesaid aloe-emodin derivative, which has mutagenic activity even
in amounts as low as 70 ppm.EP-A-520,414 describes the synthesis of diacerein via oxidation of a
rhein-9-anthrone-8-glucoside derivative, hydrolysis of the glucose
residue and acetylation.The synthesis is followed by purification from aloe-emodin by means
of liquid-liquid partitioning between an organic phase and an
aqueous phase having pH 6.5-7.5, from which diacerein is recovered
by acidification, and optionally by crystallization from ethyl
lactate.Therefore, the need for a process producing diacerein in high
yields and especially free from said impurities was deeply felt.The Applicant has found a new process for the preparation of 1,8-diacetoxy-3-carboxyanthraquinone,
which can be advantageously used
instead of the methods already known.Said process comprises:
a) acetylation of aloin (II): 

by treatment with an acetylating agent in an appropriate diluent to
obtain an acetylated product as per formula (III) 
b) treatment of acetylated product (III) with an oxidizing agent to
give raw diacerein;c) purification of raw Diacerein,
wherein purification of raw diacerein is carried out by means of at
least
