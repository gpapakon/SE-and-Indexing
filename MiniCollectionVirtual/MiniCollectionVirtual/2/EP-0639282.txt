<ABSTRACT>
Described is a glasses frame with side arms which are connected to the lens mounting by hinges by means of which they can be moved from a position of rest in which they are folded against the lens mounting out into a position of wear. The invention calls for the hinges to be made up of two parts, each part having a bearing pin and, coaxial with the pin, a bushing. When aligned with each other, the two hinge parts can be coupled together by moving them along the bearing-pin axis to form a hinge and, when coupled together, can be secured in place by locking elements. The hinge parts are rotationally symmetrical and can be coupled together to form hinge elements when rotated with respect to each other. In an extreme case the minimum number of parts necessary to form a hinge can be reduced to a single type of part. This is particularly the case when the locking elements are integral with the hinge parts.
