<ABSTRACT>
An automatic guided vehicle (1) is devoid of a 
floor and includes a substantially C-shaped body (10) defining 

a space (11) surrounded or closed from three directions including 
forward and backward directions of the vehicle (1), two hook 

units (5) disposed side by side at a bottom portion of the space 
(11) and each having one hook (50) horizontally movable back and 

forth in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle body (11), and an actuating unit (6) disposed on a portion 

of the vehicle body (11) for engaging and disengaging the hook 
(50) and a carriage. The vehicle thus constructed is able to 

transfer the carriage and a freight within a small or limited 
space, thus reducing the transportaion cost and the time of freight 

transfer operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic guided
vehicle that can automatically move between a freight transfer
station and a freight loading station on the floor of a factory,
warehouse or the like. More particularly, this invention
relates to such an automatic guided vehicle which is capable
of automatically performing loading and unloading operation
of a carriage at predetermined positions on a running passage
which is slightly larger in width than the vehicle width.The most common freight-transport vehicle of the
type having a freight transfer device for delivering freights
is a forklift. The forklift of the type concerned is usually
operated by an operator boarding thereon. In recent years,
with the spread of unmanned or automatically operated transport
vehicle, the freight transfer device has been automated.
One example of such unmanned or automatic transport vehicle
is called an automatic fork traverse (AFT). The AFT is operated
to move, without an operator aboard, between a freight-stocker
entrance and exit and a freight transfer station,
for transporting a freight, and automatically perform loading
and unloading operation by inserting and removing a fork from
one side of a freight which is placed at a predetermined level. The automatic transport vehicle described above is
constructed to handle and transport the freight alone. Another
known automatic transport vehicle is an automatic guided vehicle
(AGV) that can automatically transfer a carriage either alone
or together with a freight. The conventional AGVs are generally
separated into a trailer type and a side-fork type depending
on the system used therein for transporting the carriage.In the trailer-type carriage transport system, the
rear end of a vehicle body is coupled with the front end of a
carriage or trailer via an automatic joint. Due to such joint
structure, the behavior of the carriage being trailed is unstable,
so the vehicle passage must be wide enough to provide a room for
accommodating the irregular movement of the carriage. Furthermore,
it is very difficult to transfer the carriage from the AGV to
a transfer station. This difficulty is not the only technical
problem to be solved but leads to a substantial increase in the
cost of transportation.The side-fork type carriage transport system requires
a lift unit provided for hoisting a carriage and moving it with
wheels of the carriage kept in a floating condition relative to
the floor or the ground surface. The lift unit includes a lift
mechanism which tends to increase the

An automatic guided vehicle (1) for transporting
a carriage (3) either alone or together with a freight,

characterized in that said vehicle is devoid of a floor
includes a substantially C-shaped vehicle body (10) defining

a space (11) for receiving the carriage (3) and the freight
therein, with the carriage (3) and the freight surrounded by

said C-shaped vehicle body (10) from three directions,
at least

one hook unit (5) disposed at a bottom portion of said space (11)

and including a hook (50) horizontally movable back and forth
in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of said

vehicle (1), and actuating means (6) disposed on a portion of
said vehicle body (10) for locking and releasing said hook (50)

and the carriage (3).
An automatic guided vehicle (1) according to
claim 1, wherein said hook unit (5) includes a guide rod (51)

pivoted at one end to a portion of said vehicle body (10), a
pair of belt-driving rollers (52) supported on opposite ends

of said guide rod (51), and an endless belt (53) trained around
said belt-driving rollers (52), said hook (50) being attached

to a portion of said endless belt (53).
An automatic guided vehicle (1) according to claim
2, wherein said actuating means (6) includes a rocking mechanism

(61-69) for vertically oscillating said guide rod (51) about
said pivoted one end.
