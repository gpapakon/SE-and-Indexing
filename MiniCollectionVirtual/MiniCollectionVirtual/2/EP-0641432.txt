<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for examining objects by irradiating
them with radiation and analysing the transmitted or emitted radiation. The invention
also relates to a method and apparatus for classifying diamonds.Normally, apparatus for examining objects using radiation comprises a source, which
may be a laser of a particular wavelength or a broad-band illuminator such as a tungsten
lamp, means for controllably exposing the object to the radiation and means for
collecting radiation transmitted or emitted by the object. The transmitted or emitted
radiation may be filtered to exclude the illuminating wavelength or to transmit a single
wavelength of interest, the radiation passed by the filter being passed to a detector.Such an apparatus may be used for examining diamonds, the information obtained
depending on the wavelength of radiation studied.GB-A-2182785 discloses an infra-red spectrometer of the type where an infra-red beam
is passed through a sample and a reference sample rapidly in succession. This requires
the use of a complicated optical set up, including a quadrangle mirror element with
precise dimensions, and four deflection mirrors. Feed motions and high precision
guides are also required. The sample to be analysed must be compared to the reference
sample which is also placed in the apparatus.WO-A-9116617 discloses a method and apparatus for classifying an object. In one
embodiment the object is irradiated with stimulating radiation and the emission or
luminescence of the object is examined. It is preferred to use a laser that will cause
Raman activation in the visible spectrum. The Raman emission is of a different
wavelength to the incident radiation and is compared to a reference wavelength very
close to the Raman emission wavelength. In a second embodiment, transmission of
visible light is measured at the wavelength of a small absorption feature characteristic of
the object and at one or more reference wavelengths very close to the characteristic 
wavelength. In both embodiments a rocking or rotating filter is used to change the
wavelength being examined from the one of interest to the reference wavelength(s). In
the second embodiment, in order to compensate for variations in the spectral distribution
of the light source, either multiple observations are made and statistically analysed or
the light source is sampled using a fibre optic.It is desired to provide a method and apparatus for examining objects in which the
intensity of the irradiating radiation may be
