<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for machining and forming transcurrent openings in fibre-reinforced composite materials. Openings with damage-free edges can be formed with high precision by positioning a rotating grinding tool (5) in a preformed hole (3). In conjunction with this the material is arranged in such a way that the axis of rotation (7) of the grinding tool (5) is essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fibres at the edge of the hole. The opening is machined and formed by causing the grinding tool (5) on the one hand to rotate about its own axis (7) and on the other hand to describe an orbital motion relative to the edge of the hole. Any damage/defects (4) caused in the course of preforming are removed in this way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for machining and
forming a through opening in a fibre-reinforced
composite material starting from a preformed hole.Polymer composite materials have been known since the
1950s. These materials are composed of a protective and
consolidating polymer, either thermoplastic or thermosetting
resin plastic, usually referred to as the matrix,
and fibres (e.g. glass, carbon or aramide fibres), which
may be regarded as reinforcing material. The fibres may be
continuous and oriented in certain directions, or may be
relatively short and arranged at random in the matrix.
Composites with continuous and oriented fibres give
products with superior mechanical characteristics to
conventional polymer and metallic materials, in particular
with regard to their weight-related strength and rigidity.
Composites with shorter fibres find applications where
their characteristics are subject to rather lower
requirements. One inhibiting factor for the increased use
of composite materials is the absence of effective methods
of cutting machining. The physical and chemical properties
of composite materials mean that familiar machining methods
cannot be applied generally with successful results.Composite materials for practical applications often
contain holes for various purposes. The holes may be
required, for example, to accommodate wiring or to permit 
assembly or inspection. One particularly important category
of hole is bolt holes. Structures for practical
applications are often built up from components which have
been joined together to produce a finished product. The
purpose of the joint is to transmit the load from one part
of the structure to another. A common method of joining is
the bolted joint in which the load is transmitted via
either shearing forces or tensile forces in the bolt. The
strength of a bolted joint is influenced to a considerable
degree by the quality and accuracy of the holes. Reference
can be made here to three particular problem areas which
can arise in conjunction with making holes in polymer
composite materials:When machining laminated composite materials, the risk is
present of the layers separating (delaminating) due to the
low interlaminar strength. Extensive delamination damage
can reduce the strength of the material.The heat release during machining can cause the matrix to
soften and to block the tool, making further machining
impossible. In order to achieve good hole quality,
therefore, effective cooling of the tool/hole edge is
required, and the cut

Method for forming a through opening in a fibre-reinforced composite material
(1), said method starting with preforming a first hole (3), 
characterized in that

at least one rotatable grinding tool (5) with a wear-resistant outer working
surface (6) and with a diameter considerably smaller than that of said first hole

(3) is positioned in said hole, and in that said hole (3) is machined and formed
by causing the grinding tool (5) on the one hand to rotate about its own axis (7)

and on the other hand to describe a translation motion relative to the edge of
the hole (3), and in that the fibre-reinforced material (1) is positioned in such a

way that the axis of rotation (7) of the grinding tool (5) lies essentially
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fibres at the edge of the hole

(3), and in that the size/geometry of the finished opening differs significantly
compared with said first hole (3), in conjunction with which the radial extent of

any damage/defects (4) caused when making said preformed hole (3) define a
lower limit for the quantity of material to be removed by grinding machining.
Method in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said translatory
motion is a rotational motion.
Method in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the rotating
grinding tool (5) is used both for the preforming of the first hole (3) and for the

final forming of the opening.
