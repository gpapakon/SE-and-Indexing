<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device according to the 
preamble of claim 1. It thus deals with pinpoint delivery of 
micro-quantities of pharmaceutical compositions such as 
collagenase to a predetermined location on the outer hard 
coat of the eye, resulting in increased permeability at that 
location. The device is useful in the treatment of glaucoma 
when applied to the limbus, by increasing outflow facility. 
When treating other ocular disorders, the device may be used 
at other locations of the sclera to enhance penetration into 
the eye of periocularly administered drugs. A device of the generic type is disclosed in US-A-4135514. 
The device is comprised of a wall surrounding a 
compartment and forming a micro-container as a means for 
containing a useful agent such as a pharmaceutical drug. The 
micro-container has a bore for releasing the agent. The wall 
is comprised in at least a part of a material permeable to 
eye fluid and impermeable to the agent. A layer of a pattern 
rate controlling material that erodes in a selected 
environment for changing the release rate pattern of the 
device is carried on the semipermeable wall distant from the 
compartment. The agent is soluble in the eye fluid and 
exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient across the 
semipermeable wall against eye fluid, or the agent has 
limited solubility and is admixed with an osmotically 
effective solute soluble in eye fluid that exhibits an 
osmotic pressure gradient across the semipermeable wall 
against eye fluid. In operation, the agent is released from 
the device at different release rate patterns by the pattern 
rate controlling material eroding at a controlled rate to 
increase the amount of eye fluid available to the  
 
semipermeable wall for imbibition, which eye fluid is imbibed 
through the wall into the compartment producing a solution of 
the soluble agent or a solution of the osmotically effective 
solute containing the agent which is released through the 
bore to the exterior of the device at a rate controlled by 
the permeability of the semipermeable wall and the osmotic 
pressure gradient across the wall of the device. Collagen is the major constituent of the tissues forming 
the eye coat (Collagenase, Mandel, I. "Collagenase comes of 
age", p.1, Gordon and Breech, Science Publishers, Inc. 1972). 
Enzymes such as collagenase, which degrade collagen, are of 
importance in controlling conditions involving this collagen-rich 
tissue. The use of enzymes in the medical field is well known. 
For example,

<CLAIMS>
A device (1, 11, 31, 41) for pinpoint application of micro-quantities 
of a pharmaceutical composition to a 
preselected 
portion of the outer hard coat of the eye,
 
the device comprising a micro-container (6, 16, 36, 45) 

with a pharmaceutical composition delivery bore (5, 15) with an 
aperture, the device being characterized by fixation means for 

reversibly adhering of said micro-container to the outer 
hard coat of the eye adjacent to the preselected portion 

thereof, wherein the aperture of the pharmaceutical 
composition delivery bore (5, 15) is adapted to contact the 

preselected portion of the outer hard coat of the eye so as 
to expose only the preselected portion thereof to the 

pharmaceutical composition. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the micro-container 
(6, 16, 36, 45) and fixation means comprise a single unit. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the fixation means 
is separable from the micro-container (6, 16, 36, 45). 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the micro-container 
(6, 16, 36, 45) comprises a cylinder with a bore about 0.5 

to 1.5 mm. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the micro-container 
(6, 16, 36, 45) has a volume of about 0.2 mm
3
 to about 1.5 
mm
3
. 
A device accordint to claim 1, wherein the micro-container 
(6, 16, 36, 45) comprises a removable stopper (48) which 

enables filling the micro-container while it is in the 
state of adherence to the eye surface. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the thickness of a 
micro-container wall at its aperture is between 0.1 mm to 

0.25 mm.
