<ABSTRACT>
In an in-line color picture tube, the length L of the 
focussing electrode (12) constituting the main lens of the 

electron gun is at least two times of the diameter D of the 
main lens and the focussing electrode (12) consists of a 

first electrode (121), a second electrode (122), and a third 
electrode (123). The electron gun has a correction electron 

for forming a quadrupole lens in at least one of the opposing 
ends of the first electrode (121) and the second electrode 

(122) and the opposing ends of the second electrode (122) and 
the third electrode (123) and a voltage which varies in 

synchronization with the deflection current is applied to the 
fist electrode (121) and the third electrode (123), 

respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the shape of
electrodes constituting the main lens of the electron
gun of a color picture tube and to voltage application
to each of the electrodes.Fig. 1 is a plan view of a color picture tube
provided with an electron gun having the conventional
structure. A phosphor screen 3 on which stripes of
phosphors in three colors are alternately coated is
supported on the inner wall of a face plate 2 of a
glass vacuum envelope 1. Central axes 16, 17, and 18
of cathodes 6, 7, and 8 coincide with the central axes
of the apertures of a G1 electrode 9, a G2 electrode
10, a focussing electrode 12 constituting a main lens
and a shield cup 14 which correspond to the respective
cathodes and are arranged almost in parallel with each
other on the common plane. Although the central axis
of the center aperture of an accelerating electrode 13
which is another electrode constituting the main lens
coincides with the aforementioned central axis 17,
central axes 19 and 20 of the side apertures do not
coincide with the central axes 16 and 18 which 
correspond to them respectively and are slightly
displaced outside. Three electron beams emanated from
each cathode enter the main lens along the central
axes 16, 17, and 18, respectively. A focussing
voltage of about 5 to 10 kV is applied to the
focussing electrode 12 and an accelerating voltage of
about 20 to 30 kV is applied to the accelerating
electrode 13 so as to provide the same potentials as
those of the shield cup 14 and a conductive coating 5
installed inside the glass vacuum envelope. The center
apertures of the focussing and accelerating electrodes
are coaxial with each other, so that the main lens
which is formed at the center is rotationally
symmetrical and the center beam is focussed by the
main lens and goes straight on the path along the
axis. On the other hand, the central axes of the side
apertures of both the electrodes are displaced from
each other, so that a rotationally asymmetrical main
lenses are formed on both sides. As a result, side
beams pass through the part dislocated from the
central axis of the lens toward the center beam in the
diverging lens area formed on the accelerating
electrode side in the main lens area and are applied
with the converging force toward the central beam as
well as focussing action by the main lens. In this 
way, the three electron beams converge so as to
overlap each other at an aperture of a shadow mask 4
as well as focus. An operation for converging three
beams in this way is called static
