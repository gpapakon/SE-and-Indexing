<ABSTRACT>
A non-gelling water-soluble sugar beet fibre having serum 
cholesterol-lowering properties is obtained from sugar beet 

or sugar beet pulp by extraction with water at temperatures 
above 70°C, preferably above 90°C, more preferably 95-100°C. 

Preferably, the starting material is sugar beet pulp from 
which the sugar has already been extracted in a conventional 

sugar extraction process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a method for preparing a novel type 
of soluble fibre derived from sugar beet. Recently, an increase in dietary fibre intake has been 
recommended for the British population. Over recent years, 
the proportion of soluble fibre has decreased in the 
population diet, whilst the insoluble fibre proportion has 
increased. Various suggestions have been made to introduce dietary 
fibre into the diet of humans, but none has found widespread 
acceptance. Soluble fibre in the diet is most usually supplemented by 
means of oat bran or of breakfast cereals enriched with oat 
bran. Many people find such bran-enriched products 
distasteful and a majority of the population cannot be 
expected to consume such bran-enriched diets over the long 
term.  One source of fibre is the sugar beet. The principal use of 
sugar beet fibre is currently in animal feedstuffs. The 
crude pulp is very distasteful to people and therefore 
cannot be used as human food. Of the purified, soluble beet 
fibres, beet pectin has probably attracted most attention. 
Beet pectin is designated a "pectin" because it contains 
galacturonic acid, but it has acetate ester groups attached 
to the polygalacturonic acid and for this reason it does not 
gel, or at least not in a manner satisfactory to the food 
industry. As a food product, therefore, beet pectin has not 
yet found any substantial application. Commercial preparations of dietary fibre from sugar beet 
pulp are known. The product sold as Fibrex™ by a subsidiary 
of the Swedish Sugar Company is an example of such a 
preparation. Another example is the product sold as 
Duofiber™ by the American Crystal Sugar Company. These 
preparations suffer the limited acceptance of pure fibre 
products and have low palatability. The present applicant 
sold a whole beet fibre product as Beta-Fibre™, which has 
been successful in the health food market. Water-soluble beet fibre is also found in beet molasses, the 
liquor remaining after sugar has been extracted from sugar 
beet. Beet molasses contains sugar, soluble fibre and a 
miscellany of other by-products of sugar extraction, for 
example nitrogen compounds. Two thirds of the solids 
consist of sugar and, because soluble polysaccharide is  
 
adhesive, readily clogging the extraction equipment, the 
soluble polysaccharide content is deliberately kept to a 
minimum (usually less than 1% by weight although levels as 
high as 1.56% have been reported). Beet molasses is 
suitable for feeding to livestock, but is unpalatable to 
human
