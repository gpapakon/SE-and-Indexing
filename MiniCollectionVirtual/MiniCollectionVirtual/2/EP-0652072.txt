<ABSTRACT>
A tin-lead alloy solder is provided which 
exhibits high joint strength under conditions which are 

likely to induce fatigue fracture. The tin-lead alloy 
solder comprises 15-80 wt. % lead, 0.1-5 wt. % silver, 

0.1-10 wt. % antimony, and 0.0005-0.3 phosphorus, the 
balance being tin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tin-lead alloy 
solders. Tin-lead alloy solders, which are meltable at 
low temperatures, have long been used as handy material 
for a wide range of applications. Improved tin-lead 
alloy solders have been proposed which are each composed 
mainly of tin and lead, with a third metal ingredient 
added for characteristic improvement. Such tin-lead 
alloys are described in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. 40-25885, 45-2093, 55-18505, 57-39880, 
49-21028, and 49-23986; and Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open Nos. 48-97752, 51-54056, 54-72738, 56-144893, 
60-166191, 61-82994, 61-269998, 61-115692, 3-32487, 3-106591, 
3-204193, 3-204194, 4-333392, 54-72738, 59-70490, 
57-160594, 63-313689, 53-113245, and 58-218394. Of these 
prior art disclosures, Japanese Patent Publication No. 
57-39880 discloses a tin-lead alloy solder having 
phosphorus incorporated therein, but there is no other 
which teaches the use of phosphorus as such. Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 57-39880 discloses a tin-silver 
alloy solder containing cadmium which is suitable for use  
 
in soldering electronic parts having gold and/or silver 
films formed thereon. Cadmium loading may increase 
surface oxidation of melted solder and lower the 
wettability, as well as the spreadability, of the solder. 
It is reported that phosphorus will inhibit surface 
oxidation of melted solder, improve solder wettability, 
and prevent any such defect as may otherwise arise from 
oxide being caught in the solder melt when solidified, 
thereby to inhibit any decrease in mechanical strength. Recently, with good advance in the practice of 
high density mounting, as in surface mounting, soldering 
has been required to meet demanding conditions such that 
the solder is exposed to heat and stress. In such 
situation, conventional solders of the tin-lead alloy 
type are often found to be insufficient to provide the 
required joint strength. Especially, for soldering with 
respect to automotive printed boards and heating-part 
packaged boards, development has been desired of a solder 
which can exhibit highly reliable performance under 
conditions which are likely to induce fatigue fracture. The present invention provides a tin-lead alloy 
solder which is composed essentially of 15-80 wt. % lead, 
0.1-5 wt. % silver, 0.1-10 wt. %, and 0.0005-0.3 wt. % 
phosphorus, the balance being tin. In the present invention, the use of phosphorus  
 
in combination with silver and antimony is particularly 
effective for
