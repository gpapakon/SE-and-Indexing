<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A known device with a drive in the form of an electric motor has movable electric leads. The arrangement of a potentiometer involves difficulties in terms of construction. 2.2 In the new device, these difficulties have been solved by virtue of the fact that the mechanism comprises a segment lever (18) pivoted by the electric motor (17) and having a slotted guide track (16) and further comprises a pivoted lever (9) rigidly connected to the throttle valve shaft (3) and a toggle lever (10) which is fastened pivotably to the pivoted lever, the toggle lever (10) resting on the one hand, by means of a guide journal (15), against the slotted guide track (16) and, on the other hand, engaging by means of a toothed segment (11) in a complementary toothed segment (12) of an arbitrarily adjustable actuating lever (13) or of a toothed-segment lever (14) connected to the latter. 2.3 The new device allows idling-charge control/regulation without a reaction at an accelerator pedal etc.
