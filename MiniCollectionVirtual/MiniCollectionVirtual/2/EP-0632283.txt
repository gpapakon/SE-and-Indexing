<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining at least one operating 
parameter to determine the operating condition of a polyphase 

electric motor system comprises sensing the instantaneous 
current signal and the instantaneous voltage signal as a 

function of time for more than one electrical phase of the 
motor. The sensed current signals and the sensed voltage 

signals are both amplitude demodulated and phase demodulated 
to provide amplitude demodulated current and voltage signals 

as a function of time and phase demodulated current and 
voltage signals as a function of time. The resulting 

amplitude and phase demodulated signals are used to determine 
one or more of the following electrical parameters as a 

function of time: total real power, real power per phase, 
total reactive power, reactive power per phase, total apparent 

power, apparent power per phase, overall power factor, power 
factor per phase, electrical impedance per phase, and 

electrical balance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the measurement 
and analysis of the currents, voltages, power factors, and 
powers (real, reactive, and apparent), of polyphase motor 
systems and more particularly to an improved method and 
apparatus for enhancing the accuracy and usefulness of these 
measurements, often in conjunction with concurrent mechanical 
measurements, enabling problems with the motors and the 
equipment they drive to be diagnosed more definitively so that 
repairs can be limited to only what requires repair. Motors, particularly electrical motors, play a key 
role in industry. Such motors are used to drive fans, pumps, 
compressors, valves, and many other machines. It is 
potentially very costly to allow a significant problem to go 
on unnoticed in either the motor or the motor driven machine. 
It is also costly and very time consuming to attempt to repair 
a nonexistent problem. With present less definitive methods, 
these costly situations often occur. Thus there is a need for 
an improved diagnostic method and apparatus as described in 
the invention for use with motors and motor driven machines. Present conventional techniques have been developed 
to monitor such motor systems. One such commonly used 
conventional technique involves analyzing the signature 
developed from a single motor current probe in order to 
ascertain motor fault conditions. However, there are 
shortcomings associated with this and other standard motor 
monitoring techniques which prevent optimal motor analysis. A first problem with conventional current probe 
technology for motor system analysis is that current and 
voltage envelopes are generally estimated using inexact 
demodulation techniques such as rms to D.C. conversion or  
 
rectification, followed by low-pass filtering. These signal 
processing methods exhibit a slow response to rapidly changing 
current or voltage signals since they rely heavily on low-pass 
filtering. This reliance results in an inaccurate response to 
highly dynamic current features such as inrush current. A second problem with such conventional technology 
for motor analysis is non-linearity in the current probes, 
especially at the lower part of their detection range. This 
problem is often dealt with by specifying a lesser accuracy at 
low currents, changing the specification from percent reading 
to percent full scale, or simply not specifying the accuracy 
over a portion of the detection range. A third problem with such conventional technology is 
the distorting influence of
