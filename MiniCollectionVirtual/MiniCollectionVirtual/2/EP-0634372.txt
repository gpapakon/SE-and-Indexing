<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing an optical fiber in which 
the deviation of a cutoff wavelength from a design value 

can be minimized. It is found that, upon diameter 
reduction of a porous core glass body by heat treatment, 

when the diameter reduction ratio is set to a value larger 
than 0.90, a "spike" in the refractive index distribution 

curve of a core can be prevented, and the deviation of the 
cutoff wavelength from the design value can be minimized. 

Therefore, there is provided a method comprising the 
first step of depositing fine SiO₂ particles and fine GeO₂ 

particles, which are produced by a core formation burner (31), 
to grow a porous core glass body (21) from a distal end of a 

rotating starting rod (16) in an axial direction, the second 
step of performing diameter reduction by heating the 

grown porous core glass body by heating means (33) while 
growing the porous core glass body, and the third step of 

depositing fine SiO₂ particles produced by a cladding 
formation burner (32) to form a porous cladding glass layer on 

an outer surface of the diameter-reduced porous core 
glass body while performing growing and diameter 

reduction of the porous core glass body, wherein an outer 
diameter of the porous core glass body after the second 

step of performing diameter reduction is larger than 0.90 
times an outer diameter before diameter reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a single-mode optical fiber preform and,
more particularly, to a method used to manufacture a
glass preform constituted by a core material consisting
of SiO2 containing GeO2 and a cladding material consisting
of high-purity SiO2.According to a known method of manufacturing a
single-mode optical fiber preform, fine particles of GeO2
and SiO2 are produced by a core burner while fine SiO2
particles are produced by a cladding burner, and a porous
cladding glass layer is formed, by the cladding burner,
on the surface of a porous core glass body formed by the
core burner. Techniques disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 63-74931 and 1-153548 (corresponding to
U.S. Patent No. 4,944,783) are known to obtain a graded
index core portion in a transparent glass preform
obtained by vitrifying the completed porous preform or an
optical fiber obtained by spinning the transparent glass
preform.According to the techniques in these applications, 
when a porous core glass body is formed into a rod by
oxy-hydrogen flame, and a porous cladding glass layer is
deposited on the outer surface of the rod-like porous
core glass body by the oxy-hydrogen flame, the forepart
of a portion where the porous cladding glass layer is
deposited, i.e., the surface of the porous core glass
body between the deposition position of fine cladding
particles and the deposition position of fine core
particles is heated to reduce the diameter. The
above-mentioned U.S. Patent discloses that, with this
method, GeO2 in the porous core glass body is prevented
from moving into the porous cladding glass layer when the
preform is vitrified, thereby achieving the graded index
distribution between the core and the cladding.In a single-mode optical fiber, so-called dispersion
characteristics are required to be good. "Dispersion"
means that the waveform of a light pulse expands with time
while the light pulse propagates in the optical fiber. In
an ideal single-mode optical fiber, so-called mode
dispersion becomes zero. For this reason, it is
important to obtain a graded index core.On the other hand, a cutoff wavelength λc of the
optical fiber is a wavelength at the boundary where the
single-mode optical fiber changes to a multi-mode optical
fiber. The cutoff wavelength is a value inherent to an
optical fiber. If an optical fiber is a single-mode 
optical fiber with respect to a wavelength λ1 of signal
light to be propagated, the wavelength λ1 of the signal
light must be longer than the cutoff
