<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for recovering zinc 
from dust, and more particularly to a method for recovering zinc 
from dust containig iron as a main component. Since a dust recovered in steel works has a high iron content, 
the dust is efficiently utilized as an iron source. However, some 
of the dust contain zinc. When such zinc containing dust is charged 
into a blast furnace, the normal operation of the blast furnace may 
be hindered. Accordingly, a dust containing zinc at an excessive 
amount can not be used as a raw material for the blast furnace. For example, a blast furnace dust collected by a dust catcher 
of the blast furnace contains approximately 0.1 to 3 wt.% of zinc 
coming from iron ore, and a converter dust collected by a dust 
collector contains approximately 0.1 to 3 wt.% of zinc coming from 
galvanized steel sheets or the like which were charged to the 
converter as a scrap. When theese dusts are charged to the blast 
furnace, the zinc components are reduced to metallic zinc, and the 
metallic zinc is melted to vaporize because it has a low boiling 
point. The melting point of metallic zinc is 420°C and the boiling 
point is 920 °C. The vapor of metallic zinc ascends in the blast furnace along 
with the reducing gas, and it is cooled while ascending. A part of  
 
the metallic zinc vapor is discharged to outside of the blast 
furnace with the gas (reducing gas) of the blast furnace. However, 
the rest of the metallic zinc vapor adheres to the furnace wall 
surface in a form of liquid or solid before reaching the top of the 
furnace. If the metallic zinc adheres to the furnace wall surface 
and if it grows on the wall surface, then the gas permeability 
within the furnace is decreased and the operating condition of the 
furnace becomes abnormal. To prevent the furnace operation from 
such a bad state, currently the zinc content of the burden charging 
into the blast furnace is controlled not to exceed 0.2 kg per ton 
of hot metal. Accordingly, the application of the dust containing 
zinc is performed after removing zinc. A conventional method for removing zinc from a zinc containing 
dust and for recovering it is disclosed in unexamined Japanese 
patent publication No. 144437/1983. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
disclosed method. The reference number 40 denotes a hopper holding 
zinc containing dust, 44 denotes a mixer car holding a high 
temperature hot metal 62, 48 denotes a wet separator having a water 
tank for dust collecting. The reference number 41 denotes an 
oxygen
