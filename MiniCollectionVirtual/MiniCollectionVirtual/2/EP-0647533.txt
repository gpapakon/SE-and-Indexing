<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses heat-sensitive stencil paper and a production method thereof. Since no adhesive is 
used in this paper, the permeability to printing ink is not affected, and thus high-quality prints are obtained. The 

elimination of the use of adhesive prevents the decrease in resistance to ink, the adhesion to a thermal head, and 
emission of toxicious chlorine and improves the stability of film coating and productivity. This stencil paper is 

obtained by thermally bonding a polyester film and a porous support comprising a polyester fiber and co-stretching 
them, and the peel strength between the film and the porous support is at least 1 g/cm. Accordingly, prints obtained 

by stencil printing have very high quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-sensitive
mimeograph stencil and a process for producing it,
which is processed by a pulsatory irradiation such as
flash irradiation, infrared irradiation or laser beam, or
by contact with a thermal head, and which is subjected to
rotary press printing or litho printing. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a heat-sensitive
mimeograph stencil which does not employ an
adhesive and which is excellent in clarity of image and
in film-forming property, as well as to a process for
producing it.Heat-sensitive mimeograph stencils (hereinafter
referred to as "stencils" for short) are known which
comprise a thermoplastic film such as an acrylonitrile-based
film, polyester film or vinylidene chloride film
and a porous support such as a tissue paper
mainly comprising natural fibers or synthetic fibers, a
non-woven fabric or a woven fabric, which is adhered to
the above-mentioned thermoplastic film. For example,
JP-A-51-002512 discloses a stencil comprising an acrylonitrile-based film and an
ink-permeable support adhered to the film; JP-A-51-002513 
discloses a stencil comprising an oriented polyethylene
terephthalate film and an ink-permeable support adhered
to the film; and JP-A-57-182495 discloses a stencil comprising a
polyester film and a porous tissue paper or a mesh sheet
adhered to the film. Furthermore, JP-A-02-107488 discloses a stencil
comprising a thermoplastic film and a non-woven fabric
mainly comprising synthetic fibers, which is adhered to
the thermoplastic film.However, these stencils are not necessarily
satisfactory in the clarity of their printed image. Although
there may be various reasons for this, one of the major
causes is the formation of so called white spots (the phenomenon that
white defects are formed in an area painted black).
One of the causes of this phenomenon is that even when
the film constituting the stencil is melted to form
through openings, if adhesive adhering the film with
the support exists in the opened area, the permeation of
the printing ink is inhibited by the adhesive and the
points which constitute an image line on a printing paper
cannot be formed.Thus, in order to promote the printing quality and
clarity of the printed image, it is necessary to use as
little as possible of the adhesive.In response to this requirement, various proposals
have been made. For example, 
JP-A-58-147396 discloses a stencil
comprising a net-like adhesive layer between a porous
tissue paper and a synthetic resin film; and JP-A-04-232790
