<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a method of imaging arteries distinctly from veins using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in combination with intravenous administration of a magnetic resonance contrast agent. The contrast agent is intravenously injected in such a way that the arterial contrast concentration is substantially higher than the venous and background tissue concentration for a sufficiently long period of time to acquire the magnetic resonance image. The injection site of the contrast agent is chosen such that it is in a vein which is remote from the artery of interest. The magnetic resonance contrast agent may be intravenously infused at a variable infusion rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of magnetic
resonance angiography to detect
arterial diseases and injuries. Arterial diseases and
injuries are common and often have severe consequences
including death. Imaging arteries serves to detect and
characterize arterial disease before these consequences
occur.A conventional method of arterial imaging includes
inserting a catheter into the artery of interest (the artery
under study) and injecting radiographic contrast, for
example, an iodinated contrast, while taking radiographs of
the artery. Radiographs are commonly referred to as X-rays.
In this technique, the contrast remains in the arteries for
a few seconds during which the arteries appear distinct from
both the veins and background tissue in the radiographs.Although a catheter-based contrast arteriography
technique generally provides high quality arterial images,
there is a risk of arterial injury or damage by the catheter
and its insertion. There may be thrombosis, dissection,
embolization, perforation or other injury to the artery
itself. Furthermore, such a technique may result in a
stroke, loss of a limb, infarction or other injury to the
tissue supplied by the artery. In addition, hemorrhage at
the catheter insertion or perforation sites may require
blood transfusions. Moreover, kidney failure and brain
injury may result from the toxic effects of the X-ray
contrast. More recent techniques of arterial imaging are based
upon detecting the motion of the blood within the arteries
and/or veins. These techniques involve employing magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to image moving blood distinct from
stationary background tissues. (See, e.g., Potchen, et al.,
eds., "Magnetic Resonance Angiography/Concepts and
Applications", Mosby, St. Louis, 1993).
Such techniques do not
necessitate catheter insertion into the artery. These
techniques are commonly known as 2D time-of-flight, 3D time-of-flight,
MOTSA, magnitude contrast, phase contrast, and
spin echo black blood imaging.With pre-saturation pulses it is possible to primarily
image blood flowing in one direction. Since arteries and
veins generally flow in opposite directions, these pre-saturation
pulses allow preferential visualization of the
arteries or the veins. Because these techniques depend upon
blood motion, the images are degraded in patients who have
arterial diseases which decrease or disturb normal blood
flow. Such types of arterial diseases that decrease or
disturb normal blood flow include aneurysms, arterial
stenoses, arterial occlusions, low
