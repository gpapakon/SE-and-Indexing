<ABSTRACT>
A first invention relates to an IC card (1) provided with a card base (3) having the front and back sides; electromagnetic 
stripes (7) arranged on the back side of the substrate, and capable of storing information; and a module (5) incorporating a semi-conductor 

circuit device having connecting terminals (5-1) arranged on a given area on the front side of the base (3) so as to connect 
the card (1) with external equipement, wherein the end (5a) of the module (5) is arranged in the direction perpendicular to 

the electromagnetic stripes (7). With the structure described above, it is possible to reduce the step on the base (3) in the vicinity of 
the upper part of the module (5), thus relaxing the stress exerted on this part. Further, according to a second invention, the card 

(1) has a structure such that the end (5b) gradually becomes thinner. The step in the vicinity of the upper part of the module (5) is 
further smaller, so that the stress exerted on the part is relaxed. Furthermore, according to a third invention, a part of the end (5b) 

has a cuspidated shape, and the module (5) is so shaped that the leading end (5c) of the end (5b) is cuspidal. Hence, the step in 
the vicinity of the upper part of the base (3) is smaller, thus enabling the stress exerted on the part to be relaxed. The invention 

provides an IC card having a high durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an IC card with a built-in 
semiconductor integrated circuit device, particularly 
to a structure of an IC card having a front surface on 
which ready access terminals are provided for connecting 
to an external device and a reverse surface on which a 
magnetic body line (magnetic stripe) is provided for 
storing information therein. An IC card comprises a central processing unit (CPU) and 
a memory circuit which are respectively built in a card. 
That is, the IC card is a kind of computer. Accordingly, 
the IC card can be applied to a variety of purposes. To make the IC card generalize, the standardization of 
the IC card is now under progress internationally 
according to a standard of an International Organization 
for Standardization (hereinafter referred to as an ISO) 
and in Japan according to a standard of a Japanese 
Industrial Standard (hereinafter referred to as a JIS). For example, according to ISO7816-1, ISO7816-2 
(corresponding to JISX6303) a distance A ranging from an 
upper end 101 of an IC card 100 to an upper side of ready 
access terminals 103-1, 103-2 (a side nearest to the 
upper end 101 among sides defining terminals) of an IC 
chip module 103 is set to be 19.23mm in maximum as  
 
illustrated in Figure 11. According to an ISO7811-5 (corresponding to JISX6302) a 
distance B ranging from the upper end 101 of the IC card 
100 to a base of a third track 105a of a magnetic stripe 
105 is prescribed to be 15.32mm at minimum and 15.82mm at 
maximum as illustrated in Figure 12. Figure 13 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a main 
portion of the IC card provided with a magnetic stripe 
which meets the standard as set forth above (which is so-called 
JIS-I type IC card in Japan). A positional 
relation between the IC chip module 103 and the magnetic 
stripe 105 can be easily understood from Figure 13. In this case, a distance C ranging from the upper end 101 
of the IC card to a base of the magnetic stripe 105 comes 
to 16.82mm which is the sum of the distance B ranging 
from the upper end 101 to the base of the third track 
105a, i.e. 15.82mm in maximum and a 1mm margin for 
covering errors. Since the distance A ranging from the 
upper end 101 to the upper sides of the ready access 
terminals 103-1, 103-2 is 19.23mm in maximum, a distance 
D ranging from the upper end 101 to the upper side of the 
IC chip module 103 comes to 18.23mm which is the 
difference between the distance A and a 1mm margin to be 
involved in manufacturing the module.
