<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical cell and electrode assembly in 
which an alkali metal anode 1 and a cathode assembly 50 

are wound together in a unidirectional winding having 
substantially straight sides such that the winding will 

fit into a prismatic cell. The anode 1 and cathode 50 
are arranged in the winding to provide for even 

utilization of reactive material during cell discharge 
by placing cathode and anode material in close proximity 

throughout the electrode assembly in the proportions in 
which they are utilized. The winding also contributes 

to even utilization of reactive material by employing 
multiple tabs 70,72 on the cathode assembly 50 to ensure 

that cathode material is evenly utilized throughout the 
electrode assembly during cell discharge and also so 

that connections to the tabs are readily made.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrochemical cells having
an alkaline metal anode and particularly, but not exclusively,
to a primary lithium electrochemical cell adapted for high
reliability and high rates of current discharge.Implantable cardiac defibrillators are used to treat
patients suffering from ventricular fibrillation, a chaotic
heart rhythm that can quickly result in death if not
corrected. In operation, the defibrillator device
continuously monitors the electrical activity of the heart of
the patient, detects ventricular fibrillation, and in
response to that detection, delivers appropriate shocks to
restore a normal heart rhythm. Shocks as large as 30-35
joules may be needed. Shocks are delivered from capacitors
capable of providing that energy to the patient in a fraction
of a second. In order to provide timely therapy to the
patient after the detection of ventricular fibrillation, it
is necessary to charge the capacitors with the required
amount of energy in only a few seconds. Thus, the power
source must have a high rate capability to provide the
necessary charge to the capacitors, it must also possess low
self-discharge in order to have a useful life of many months,
and it must be highly reliable to provide an urgently needed
therapy whenever necessary. In addition, since cardiac
defibrillators are implanted, the battery must be able to
supply energy from a minimum packaged volume.One battery suitable for defibrillator use is disclosed
in U.S. Patent 4,830,940 to Keister et al. As disclosed therein, the
anode material of the battery is lithium and the reactive
cathode material is silver vanadium oxide. The anode is
constructed in a serpentine-like fashion with cathode plates
inserted between each of the convolutions thereof on both
sides thereof. The electrolyte for a lithium battery or cell
is a liquid organic type which comprises a lithium salt and
an organic solvent. Both the anode and the cathode plates are 
encapsulated in an electrically insulative separator
material. However, a disadvantage of this battery design is
that the serpentine anode is not efficiently used since anode
material at the bends is.not faced by cathode material and is
therefore not fully utilized. An improvement which addresses
this problem is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,147,737 to Post et
al, in which the active material on the serpentine-type
electrode is positioned so that the sections of the
serpentine-like structure which do not face cathode plates do
not contain anode active material. However, the serpentine
