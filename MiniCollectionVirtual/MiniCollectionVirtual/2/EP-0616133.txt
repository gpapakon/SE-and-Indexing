<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pumping machine utilizing
expansion energy of compressed air and a cylinder for the pumping
machine.As regards water pumping, there has heretofore been known
so-called storage pumps which comprise valve means and a piston
reciprocating therebetween and which deliver water in one direction
by utilizing the reciprocating motion of the piston to perform water
pumping.However, since these conventional storage pumps deliver water
only in one direction by the reciprocating motion of the piston, they
require a large amount of energy because of frictional resistance to
the piston and resistance to the movement of the water.The present inventor has succeeded in enabling sufficient water
pumping with extremely low energy consumption, not by simply causing
only water to move in one direction, but by bringing air into
coexistence with water attendantly upon movement of the water,
compressing the air, and then releasing the air from the pressure to
generate expansion force simultaneously with discharge of the water
to be pumped up.It is an object of the present invention to provide a pumping
machine enabling such highly efficient water pumping and a cylinder 
preferably used in the pumping machine.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a power
generator system using them. In particular, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a highly efficient and energy saving
pumping machine and a power generator system utilizing the same by
re-pressurizing returned air having a residual pressure into
compressed air for supplying to the above-mentioned cylinder.The present invention includes a pumping machine which comprises
valve means comprising a plurality of check valves and having
double-layer structure that vertically move by delivery of
compressed air, and air intakes for introducing external air in mid
course of the reciprocating motion of the valve means, wherein
external air is sucked in mid course of the reciprocating motion of
the valve means as well as water to be pumped, then the air sucked in
is compressed, and a water flow flowing only in one direction is
generated by expansion force obtained at the time of releasing the
air from pressure to appropriate for water pumping force.According to the present invention, there is provided a cylinder
for the pumping machine comprising:
a cylindrical hollow body formed with a first through-hole at its
mid portion and second and third through-holes in the vicinities of
its ends,a cylindrical hollow member
