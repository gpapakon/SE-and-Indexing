<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical assembly 
comprising a holder (1) and an optical element (3). The 

holder has an inner wall (9) on which a plurality of parallel 
ribs (11) are formed. The optical element has an outer wall 

(7), a plurality of gaps (13) being formed between this outer 
wall and the ribs. The optical element is connected to the 

holder by means of an adhesive which is applied exclusively 
in said gaps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical assembly with an 
optical axis, comprising a holder with an interior space 
bounded by an inner wall and an optical element mounted in 
said holder and having an outer wall, an adhesive being 
applied between the inner wall of the holder and the outer 
wall of the optical element. Such optical assemblies are known from EP 0090218 
(herewith incorporated by reference). The known assemblies 
each comprise an optical component, such as a round mirror or 
a lens, and a holder which forms part of an optical 
apparatus. The holder has a cylindrical bore in which the 
optical component is mounted, a cylindrical gap being formed 
between the inner wall of the holder and the outer wall of 
the optical component in the bore. This gap is wholly or 
partly filled with an adhesive agent such as a glue. Optical assemblies are employed in optical 
apparatuses, such as for example optical disc players. In 
such apparatuses it is important that the various optical 
elements are correctly positioned relative to each other. For 
the manufacturing process it is therefore essential that the 
optical elements in the optical assemblies are situated at 
the correct predetermined locations and in the correct 
position relative to the holder. Important in this respect is 
the positional accuracy in the direction of the optical axis 
(Z-direction) of the optical assembly, in the direction of 
two axes which extend perpendicularly to the optical axis and 
to each other (X-direction and Y-direction), and in the 
directions of rotation about the last-mentioned axes. In one of the assemblies disclosed in EP 0090218 the 
adhesive is applied in the form of an annular adhesive layer, 
the layer also adhering to a wall portion of the holder which 
extends in a plane which is oriented transversely of the 
optical axis. However, this construction has the disadvantage  
 
that, as it cures, shrinkage of the applied adhesive is 
inevitable and gives rise to impermissible displacements of 
the optical component in the Z-direction. Moreover, the 
likelihood of the optical component being tilted about the X- and 
Y-axes as a result of shrinkage stresses in the adhesive 
layer is substantial. The above positioning problem can be 
mitigated to some extent by reducing the thickness of the 
adhesive layer in the Z-direction but the required strength 
and stability of the adhesive bond distinctly limit this 
possibility. A suitable choice of the adhesive may also 
reduce said problem, but completely eliminating
