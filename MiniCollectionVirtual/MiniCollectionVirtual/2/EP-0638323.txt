<ABSTRACT>
The medical device comprises a protective cap (15; 16) which sits on a shoulder (17; 18). The protective cap is fixed on the shoulder by a seal (20; 22). This seal comprises a composition that has been applied in the free-flowing state onto the regions adjoining the two parts and has been cured thereon, preferably a hot melt adhesive. When the protective cap is removed for the first time, the seal breaks with a snapping noise. Breaking of this seal is visible. The seal (20; 22) is simple and quick to apply. It does not require any structural modifications of the medical device or the protective cap. The opening force required for removal of the protective cap is not significantly increased.
