A newspaper conveyor has an endless conveyor chain (1) running along a conveyor (3) with a plurality of newspaper grips (7) in rows. Their movable clamp (11) may be set in two opening positions, a first one in which the movable clamp (11) is held open against the closing force of a spring (20) by a cam control curve (28) and a second in which the movable clamp (11) is self-lockingly held open by friction by the leaf spring (20).

base (9, 9') of the supporting part (8, 8') and via a 
second leg (22, 22') at least on the bearing part (17, 17') 

of the movable gripper jaw (11, 11'). 
Newspaper conveyor according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the bearing part (17, 17') of the movable gripper jaw 

(11, 11') is provided with a bearing surface (23, 23') for

curved convexly about a bend axis parallel to the pivot 
axis (13, 13'). 
Newspaper conveyor according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the curvature of the bearing surface (23, 23') 

relative to the pivot axis (13, 13') is designed in such a 
manner that the second leg (22, 22') of the leaf spring 

(20, 20') springs in increasingly in the direction of the 
first leg (21, 21') as the opening angle of the movable 

gripper jaw (16, 16') increases. 
Newspaper conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the second leg (22, 22') of the leaf 

spring (20, 20') is provided at its end with a stop bar 
(24, 24') directed towards the first leg (21, 21'). 
Newspaper conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the opening angle (W1) of the movable 

gripper jaw (11, 11') in the first opening position is 
smaller than its opening angle (W2) in the second opening 

position.  
 
Newspaper conveyor according to claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that the second leg (22, 22') of the leaf 

spring (20, 20') is elastically deformable when the movable 
gripper jaw (11, 11') passes from the first opening 

position into the second opening position, with the stop 
bar (24, 24') coming to bear against the first leg (21, 

21') in order to increase the friction between the bearing 
surface (23, 23') and the second leg (22, 22'). 
Newspaper conveyor according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the bearing region of the bearing surface (23, 23') of 

the movable gripper jaw (11, 11') on the second leg (22, 
22') of the leaf spring (20, 20') is displaced in the 

direction of the base (34, 34') of the leaf spring (20, 
20') when the gripper jaw (11, 11') moves into the second 

opening position. 
Newspaper conveyor according to one of claims 2 to 9,
