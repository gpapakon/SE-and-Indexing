<ABSTRACT>
A securing clip 32 is used to secure a lock barrel 24 in 
a vehicle door. The barrel 24 is inserted through an 

aperture in the door and the clip 32 is then put on the 
back of the barrel and rotated to perform a locking 

function. The securing clip has two portions, one of 
which 36 rotates to perform the locking so that lugs 46 

on this portion engage under shoulders 48 on the lock 
barrel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a securing clip for securing a 
lock barrel to a vehicle door and an arrangement including such a securing clip. Vehicle door lock barrels and the surrounding area of the 
vehicle door are targets for thieves. Thieves may try to 
force the lock barrel out of the vehicle door, or they may 
try to pierce the door skin to obtain direct access to the 
door latch operating cables and rods inside the door. United States patent number 2 312 643 describes an 
arrangement for securing a lock barrel to a door, the 
arrangement comprising a lock barrel having a head, a 
shank, and radially extending shoulders around the shank, 
the cross-sectional area of the head being larger than 
that of the shank so that the shank and the shoulders can 
pass through an aperture in a door through which the head 
cannot pass. The arrangement includes a security clip according to the preamble of claim 1, 
which has a first portion adapted to fit over the shank 
and to engage non-rotatably therewith, and a second 
portion also adapted to fit over the shank but able to 
rotate relative to the shank, the second portion having 
radially inwardly directed lugs which can be rotated to 
engage behind shoulders on the lock barrel. United States patent number 4 823 571 discloses a similar 
arrangement, in which the shank of the lock barrel is 
provided with a screw thread, and the second portion is 
a nut which is used to retain the lock barrel in the door. It is an object of the invention to make it more difficult 
for thieves to defeat the door lock system. According the present invention there is provided a 
securing clip for securing a lock barrel to a vehicle  
 
door, the clip comprising a first portion adapted to fit 
over the shank of a lock barrel and to engage non-rotatably 
therewith, and a second portion also adapted to 
fit over the shank but able to rotate relative to the 
shank, the second portion having radially inwardly 
directed lugs which can be rotated to engage behind the 
shoulders on the lock barrel, characterised in that the 
first and second portions are interengageable to form a 
single security clip, and axially extending arms on the 
first portion engage in circumferentially extending slots 
in the second portion so that the possible rotation of the 
second portion relative to the first is limited by the 
length of the slots. Preferably the radially inwardly directed lugs extend 
axially as well as radially and are tapered in a 
circumferential direction so that as the second portion

<CLAIMS>
A securing clip for securing a lock barrel to a 
vehicle door, the clip comprising a first portion (34) 

adapted to fit over the shank (26) of a lock barrel and 
to engage non-rotatably therewith, and a second portion 

(36) also adapted to fit over the shank but able to rotate 
relative to the shank, the second portion having radially 

inwardly directed lugs (46) which can be rotated to engage 
behind shoulders (48) on the lock barrel (24), 

characterised in that the first and second portions 
(34,36) are interengageable to form a single security clip 

(32) by means of axially extending arms (40) on the first portion 
(34) which engage in circumferentially extending slots (42) in 

the second portion so that the possible rotation of the 
second portion relative to the first is limited by the 

length of the slots. 
A clip as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the radially 
inwardly directed lugs (46) extend axially as well as 

radially and are tapered in a circumferential direction 
so that as the second portion (36) is rotated with the 

clip positioned around a lock barrel, the lugs perform a 
camming action against shoulders (48) of the lock barrel 

to pull the head (28) of the lock barrel (24) against the 
surface of the door. 
A clip as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the 

second portion (36) is dished so that, in use, its outer 
periphery is spaced away from the inner surface of the 

door skin. 
A clip as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
first and second portions (34,36) are made of spring 

steel.  
 
A clip as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
slots (42) include notches (54) into which the arms (40) 

can fit at the end of the rotational movement, thus 
preventing accidental rotation of one component relative 

to the other in an unintended direction. 
An arrangement for securing a lock barrel to a 
vehicle door (12), the arrangement comprising a lock 

barrel (24) having a head (28), a shank (26) and radially 
extending shoulders (30,48) around the shank, the cross-sectional 

area of the head being larger than that of the 
shank so that the shank and shoulders can pass through an 

aperture (16) in a door through which the head cannot 
pass, the arrangement also including a security clip (32) 

which has a first portion (34) adapted to fit over the 
shank (26) and to engage non-rotatably therewith, and a 

second portion (36) also adapted to fit over the shank but 
able to rotate relative to the shank, the second portion 

having radially inwardly directed lugs (46) which can be 
rotated to engage behind the shoulders (48) on the lock 

barrel (24), characterised in that the first and second 
portions (34,36) are interengageable to form a single security clip (32) by means of axially 

extending arms (40) on the first portion (34) which engage in 
circumferentially extending slots (42) in the second 

portion so that the possible rotation of the second 
portion relative to the first is limited by the length of 

the slots. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the 
second portion (36) has a circular periphery of diameter 

substantially larger than that of the lock barrel head 
(28). 
A vehicle door with a lock barrel secured to the 
door, wherein the door has an outer skin (12) in which the 

lock barrel (24) is mounted, the outer skin being pierced  
 

by a non-round hole (16) the shape of which is 
complementary to a non-round formation (30) formed on the 

lock barrel shank below the head, and wherein the lock 
barrel is secured to the door by a clip (32) as claimed 

in any one of Claims 1 to 5. 
A vehicle door as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the 
first portion (34) of the securing clip has a 

complementarily shaped aperture so that it can be held 
against rotation by engagement on the shaped part of the 

lock barrel.
