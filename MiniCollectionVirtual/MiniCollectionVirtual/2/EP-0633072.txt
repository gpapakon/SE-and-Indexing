<ABSTRACT>
In a cleaning apparatus for drains or pipes with a housing (1) having a water connection (5) for a water hose, a turbine wheel (10) is arranged close to the rear side (4) of the housing (1) to form a hydraulic motor. A gear unit (12) is located between the turbine wheel (10) and the cutting spindle (3). The gear unit (12) is sealed off from the fed water, connects the turbine wheel (10) to the cutting spindle (3) and reduces the speed of the turbine wheel (10). The cutting spindle (3) is thereby able to work with sufficiently high torque for the cleaning.
