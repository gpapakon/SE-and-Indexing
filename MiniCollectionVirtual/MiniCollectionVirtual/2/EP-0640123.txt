<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides fermentation vessels (10) comprising at least one fermentation zone, each of said zones being divided into two or more compartments by transverse baffles (16) each containing bypass means (17, 18) to permit passage of medium from the inlet (19) of the zone to an outlet (20) longitudinally spaced therefrom, a substantially vertical partition (11) being provided which divides the said zone from the region of said inlet to the region of said outlet into two channels connectd by gaps above and below said partition along its length and gas inlet means (25) being situated at the bottom of the said zone and on one side of the partition so that, in operation, influx of gas causes fermentation medium to flow transversely around the partition in the flow path defined by the two channels and the gaps above and below the partition while also moving longitudinally through the compartments of the said zone, means being provided to permit recycling of at least part of the effluent. These vessels are suitable for scale up. The invention further provides fermentation methods using such vessels wherein stirring is effected by cyclical movement of the medium therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIOREACTOR SYSTEMThis invention r._-u-.T-.es tc bioreactors (fermentation vessels) and to as--. r..---lies of such vessels.In general, biorea.r rs are vessels designed to permit growth of microorπ.nnisms or other cells therein and to digest the substrate medium in which the cells are suspended. In continuous fermentation, such vessels permit passage of medium containing the cells through the vessel and continuous collection of the digested medium. In one type of continuous fermentation, the vessel is elongated and the r.edium passes in plug flow or an approximation thereto, so that back and forward mixing are minimized and at any point along the length of the vessel, the medium is essentially under batch fermentation conditions and undergoes the required fermentation in the time taken to traverse the length of the tank.However, it is highly beneficial for the suspended cells to maintain constant contact with the medium and to avoid settling out under gravity. Furthermore, it has been found that traditional cylindrical fermentation vessels, such as tanks cr vats are difficult to scale up to capacities of several thousand cubic metres since the change in geometry rfectε the biological environment within the vessel. Also it is frequently necessary to aerate the system with a stream of air bubbles which generates turbulence and causes mixing that are in conflict with ideal plug flow. These problems can be overcome by use cr a long split channel bioreactor, for example of the typ- -.escribed in our International patent application No. PCT-ΕP 1, 01322 , published under number WO92/01779, in which a tank is longitudinally divided by a vertical panel in which medium moving longitudinally through the tank is also caused to move cyclically around 

approximation of plu flow.We have now surprisingly found that the incorporation of transverse baffles into such a vessel such that by pass means --re provided tc permit the medium to pass longit dinally through the vessel whilst also cyclically movincr tround the panel not only improves the plug flow but permits efficient scale up.According tc the present invention we provide a fermentation vessel comprising at least one fermentation zone, each cf said zones being divided into two or more compai'tments by transverse baffles each containing bypass means to permit passage of medium from the inlet of the zone tc an outlet longitudinally spaced therefrom, a substantially vertical partition being provided which divides the said zone from the region of said inlet to the

Claims
1. A fermentation vessel comprising at least one fermentation zone, each of said zones being divided into two or more compartments by transverse baffles each containing bypass means to permit passage of medium from the inlet of the zone to an outlet longitudinally spaced therefrom, a substantially vertical partition being provided which divides the said zone from the region of said inlet to the region of said outlet into two channels connected by gaps above and below said partition along its length and gas inlet means being situated at the bottom of the said zone and on one side of the partition so that, in operation, influx of gas causes fermentation medium to flow transversely around the partition in the flow path defined by the two channels and the gaps above and below the partition while also moving longitudinally through the compartments of the said zone, means being provided to permit recycling of at least part of the effluent.
2. A vessel as claimed in claim 1 wherein the by-pass means comprise apertures within the baffles.
3. A vessel as claimed in claim 2 wherein the apertures are alternately positioned in adjacent baffles either towards the top of the baffle, or towards the bottom of the baffle.
4. A vessel as claimed in any one of the previous claims wherein the ratio of the height to breadth is in the range 3:1 to 10:1.
5. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the gas inlet means is a sparger in each compartment located on one side of the longitudinal 


partition.
6. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims v/hich is sealed and in which means are provided to withdraw any effluent gas.
7. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which means are provided to apply at least a partial vacuum.
8. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims provided with heating and/or cooling means.
9. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in v/hich the outlet is connected to separation means to concentrate solids in the effluent and/or clarify the effluent.
10. A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a dividing wall having by-pass means separates the compartments into two groups, one on each side of the wall so that longitudinal flow of medium is through the compartments on one side of said wall followed by passage through the by-pass means in said dividing wall and longitudinal flow in the reverse direction through the compartments on the other side of the dividing wall, and wherein inlet and outlet are brought into juxtaposition.
11. A vessel as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 wherein the compartments are arranged in tiers wherein longitudinal flow of medium in an upper tier is followed by overflow to the tier below in which longitudinal flow is in the reverse direction.
12. An assembly of vessels as claimed in claim 1 connected in parallel. 


13. An assembly as claimed in claim 12 wherein the vessels share dividing walls and having a common gas space between the liquid level and the lid.
14. An assembly of vessels as claimed in claim 1 connected in series.
15. A method of fermentation in which a fermentation medium is introduced into the inlet of a fermentation vessel as defined in claim 1 and passes to the outlet thereof while gas from the gas inlet means of said fermentation vessel causes the medium to move cyclically in a substantially perpendicular plane with respect to the base of the fermentor.
16. A method as claimed in claim 15 in which the medium comprises solid particles maintained in suspension by transverse cycling around the substantially vertical partition.
17. A method as

 claimed in claim 15 or claim 16 wherein the medium comprises microorganisms or plant or animal cells.
