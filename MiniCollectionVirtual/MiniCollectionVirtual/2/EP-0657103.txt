<ABSTRACT>
Ubidecarenone is used for treating meat, fish or processed 
food made from meat or fish in order to maintain the freshness 

thereof. The freshness is also maintained by giving 
ubidecarenone to an animal being bred for the production of 

meat or fish. Furthermore, ubidecarenone has growth-promoting 
effect on animals, when administered to them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for maintaining
the freshness, and particularly the color, of meat, fish or
processed foods made from meat or fish.Meat of livestock and some fish are of a bright red color
when fresh, but the color changes to brown or gray with time.
Thus, discoloration of meat is an important indication of
aging, and consumers usually select meat or fish based on color
as a guide to quality. Japanese consumers pay in particular
attention to the color of raw fish because they often serve it
in a raw state. They also pay much attention to the color of
raw meat. The discoloration of meat and fish is predominantly
caused by oxidation of haem pigments. The haem pigments
contained in meat include myoglobin in myofibril and hemoglobin
in erythrocytes of residual blood. It has been attempted to
maintain the color of meat, fish, and processed foods made of
meat or fish by the use of additives, but the use of additives
in the past has been insufficiently effective or has had safety
problems.Aging of meat is indicated by the following phenomena :(1)
fading caused by oxidation of haem pigments, (2) spoilage by
oxidation of lipids, (3) rotting by microorganisms, (4) losses
by dripping and (5) changes in texture. Various methods for
suppressing aging of meat have been investigated.
Particularly, in recent years, purchases of food have been
decreasing in quantity due to smaller families, and furthermore
people desire faster and simpler cooking. Accordingly, it is
becoming more common for meat or fish to be sold in small packs
and in the form of slices, but sliced meat is more susceptible
to aging, particularly fading, than is a block of meat. Thus,
the need exists for an effective method for suppressing aging
of meat, fish and processed foods, thereby maintaining the
freshness thereof.One known method for preventing aging of meat, for 
example, is to prevent oxidation of oils and fats contained in
meat or fish by using an antioxidant to suppress spoilage
caused by lipid oxidation. Vitamin C, natural vitamin E, and
erythorbic acid can be used as an antioxidant for fresh meat or
fish in Japan; but they are not sufficient to maintain
freshness, particularly color. Also, antioxidants such as
butylhydroxy toluene (BHT) and butylhydroxy anisole (BHA) have
been used for oils and fats used in processing, but it was
reported that BHT and BHA are carcinogenic (Ito et. al J. Matl.
Cancer Inst. 70, 343) and their use is prohibited by
administrative guidance.Also, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and

Use of ubidecarenone for treating meat, fish, or processed food made
from meat or fish in order to maintain the freshness of the meat, fish, or

processed food by preventing the muscles of meat or fish from discoloration
due to oxidation of haem pigments contained in the muscles.
Use according to claim 1, wherein ubidecarenone is used in the form
of a
n aqueous solution or emulsion of ubidecarenone.
Use according to claim 2, wherein said solution or emulsion further
comprises at least one selected from vitamin E and vitamin C.
Use according to claim 2 or 3, wherein treatment with the aqueous
solution or emulsion of ubidecarenone is conducted by dipping, spraying

or injection using a meat injector.
Use according to anyone of claims 2 to 4, wherein ubidecarenone is
present in a concentration of 5-200 ppm in the aqueous solution or emulsion.
Use of ubidecarenone for giving to an animal in order to produce meat
or fish which maintains the freshness thereof by preventing the muscles of

meat or fish from discoloration due to oxidation of haem pigments contained
in the muscles.
Use according to claim 6, wherein ubidecarenone is given by providing
the animal with feed containing ubidecarenone as a feed additive.
Use according to claim 7, wherein the feed contains 5-200 ppm as
ubidecarenone.
Use according to claims 7 or 8, wherein the feed further comprises at
least one selected from vitamin E and vitamin C. 
Use according to anyone of claims 6 to 9. wherein ubidecarenone is
used in the form of a purified product.
Use according to anyone of claims 7 to 9, wherein ubidecarenone is
used in the form of microorganisms containing ubidecarenone.
