<ABSTRACT>
Electrical connecting member for two male blade terminals, of the type produced from a sheet of metal having good electrical conductivity and provided with a degree of elasticity, this sheet of metal being folded in order to exhibit a conduit having a rectangular cross-section with a web (6) (37), two flanges (7 and 8) (38, 39) and an upper (ceiling) wall (17, 17a, 40), the upper wall (17, 17a, 40) including, facing inwards, an elastic strip (14, 14a) (35, 35a), whereas the web (6, 37) comprises, facing inwards, an elastic blade terminal (9, 42), the said member exhibiting two channels (28, 29, 56, 58) each of which is intended to receive a male blade element (25, 26, 57, 59), the channels opening one on one side and the other on the opposite side, characterised in that the elastic blade terminal (9, 42) with which the web (6, 37) is provided is cut out in the said web (6, 37) and suitably bent (arched) in order to extend on the inside, substantially parallel to the latter, the corresponding channel being made between the said blade terminal (9, 42) and the said web (6, 37).

An electrical connecting member for two male tabs, 
produced from a strip of metal which is a good conductor 

of electricity, endowed with a certain elasticity and 
bent to have a conduit having a rectangular section with 

a core (37), two flanks (38, 39) and a top wall (40), the 
top wall (40) comprising, towards the interior, an 

elastic strip (35, 35a), whereas the core (37) comprises, 
towards the interior, an elastic tab (42), the said 

member having two channels (56, 58) each intended to 
receive a male tab (57, 59), one of the channels opening 

on one side and the other on the other side,
characterised in that
 the elastic tab (42) with which the 
core (37) is provided is stamped into the said core (37) 

and suitably bent to extend to the interior, 
substantially parallel to the latter, the corresponding 

channel being provided between the said elastic tab (42) 
and the said core (37) whereas the elastic strip (35, 

35a) of the top wall (40) is formed by two extensions of 
the latter on the side of the channel (56) opposite that 

provided between the elastic tab (42) stamped into the 
core (37) and the latter, and which are bent towards the 

interior of the conduit to form a first hairpin part (44) 
and a second hairpin part (45), the free ends bearing 

against the inner face of the said top wall (40). 
An electrical connecting member for two male tabs, 
according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the free end (42a) of the elastic 
tab (42) is bent on the side opposite the core (37).  

 
An electrical connecting member for two male tabs, 
according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the top wall (40), on the side 
opposite its end provided with elastic strips, has a stop 

(48) extending towards the core (37) and to the right of 
the free end (42a) of the elastic tab (42). 
An electrical connecting member for two male tabs, 
according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 on its free edge the top wall (40) 
comprises a lug (52), whereas the corresponding flank 

(38) is provided, firstly, with a flap (50) intended to 
be bent against the outer face of the said top wall (40) 

and, secondly, with a slot (51) intended to receive the 
said lug (52). 
An electrical connecting member for two male tabs, 
according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 in the vicinity of its free edge 
the top wall (40) has a pressed part (54) with which the 

flap (50) comes to cooperate.
