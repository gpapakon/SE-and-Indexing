<CLAIMS>
A device for preventing damage to production means having 
rotating cylinders, preferably blanket cylinders of web-fed 

rotary printing machines, resulting from broken webs, preferably 
printed paper webs, using direction-switched clutches, the web 

wrapping partly round a rotatably mounted web-guiding roller (9), 
and pressure-contact rollers (12) being provided in order to 

press the web against the web-guiding roller (9), characterized 
in that the web-guiding roller (9) is arranged such that it may 

be driven temporarily in the set running direction of the web by 
means of a direction-switched clutch (24; 26, 27, 28, 29). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that a sprag 
arrangement (26, 27, 28, 29) having a driving part (driver star) 

(26), an output ring (27) and a plurality of clamp rollers (28) 
is provided as the direction-switched clutch (24). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the direction-switched clutch is arranged in the interior of the 

hollow web-guiding roller (9). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the driving part (26) is arranged form-fittingly on a shaft (11). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, 
during the normal operating condition of the production means (7, 

8; 4, 6), the driving part (26) of the direction-switched clutch 
(24) arranged in the interior of the web-guiding roller (9) may 

be driven in each case at a speed which is slower than the 
particular speed of the web-guiding roller (9). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the speed of the driving part (26) of the direction-switched 

clutch (26, 27, 28, 29) is between 0.2 and 1.5% slower than the 
speed of the web-guiding roller (9).  

 
A device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the driving part (26) is driven from the drive of the cylinders 

(7, 8). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the driving part (26) is driven by means or a speed-regulated 

motor. 
A device according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 
the driving part (26) is arranged in connecting manner by means 

of clamp rollers (28) and an output ring connected force-fittingly 
and form-fittingly to the internal diameter of the web-guiding 

roller (9). 
A device according to Claim 9, characterized in that the 
hollow web-guiding roller (9) is provided as an output ring (26). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
a torque-switched clutch (21) is provided between the drive (11) 

of the driving part (26) and a power-driven drive on the drive 
(11).
