<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a thin film transistor having 
reduced off-current leakage includes the steps of forming a TFT body 

with a channel region disposed between a source electrode and a 
drain electrode and then passivating the exposed portion of the 

channel region. The passivation includes the steps of wet etching the 
exposed portions of the channel region in an hydrofluoric acid etchant 

for a first selected etch time; dry etching the exposed channel region 
in a reactive ion etching procedure for a second selected etch time; 

wet etching the channel region again with hydrofluoric add for a third 
selected etch time; and then treating the channel region with a 

cleansing agent, such as photoresist stripper; and annealing the 
exposed portion of the channel region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of thin-film field
effect transistors, and in particular to a method of treating the channel
region of the transistor so as to reduce off-current leakage.In solid state electronic devices thin film field effect
transistors (TFTs) are commonly used as switches. In particular, in
imaging and display devices, a TFT is commonly associated with
each pixel to enable a respective electrical signal to be coupled to or
from each individual pixel. One of the important performance factors
of the TFT is low off-current, or leakage; low leakage is desirable so
that the display or imager exhibits low noise, and so that an imager
has a linear response to incident light. Off-current refers to the
leakage current between the source and drain electrodes with the
gate electrode voltage a few volts or more below the threshold
voltage, that is the voltage at which the transistor starts to conduct
significantly.Imager and display arrays are typically fabricated on
large substrates on which many components, including TFTs, address
lines, and devices such as photosensors, are formed through the
deposition and patterning of layers of conductive, semiconductive,
and insulative materials. The TFT fabrication process involves
several patterning steps to produce the desired arrangement of a
channel region between a source and a drain electrode with the
desired arrangement of semiconductive material disposed between
the electrodes and over the gate electrode. The condition of the 
channel region of a TFT after this fabrication process can effect the
off-current of the device. Common passivation techniques, such as
the deposition of a dielectric layer over the channel region of the TFT
after it has been fabricated, have not provided reproducibly low off-current
leakage results. Another approach to passivation is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,704,783 of Possin et al. (Possin '783)
corresponding to the preamble of claim 1,
which
patent is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
The passivation process of Possin
'783 includes removing a portion of the semiconductor material at the
bottom of the channel region gap, plasma etching the region,
exposing the region to monoethanolamine solution, rinsing with
distilled water, and air baking prior to depositing a dielectric material
passivation coating. As reported in Possin '783, this passivation
method advantageously reduced off-current leakage in TFTs to a
nominal value of about 1 picoampere (as compared with about 50
picoamperes in a TFT
