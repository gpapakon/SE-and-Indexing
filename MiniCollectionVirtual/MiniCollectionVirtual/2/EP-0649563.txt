<ABSTRACT>
A vent-safe protector (40) for a telecommunications gas tube (12) includes two electrodes (16, 55) (61, 63) separated by a non-linear resistive material (45). Each electrode is connected to a gas tube protector terminal (16, 18) to provide an alternate discharge path if the gas tube (12) fails. The non-linear resistive material (45) is substantially non-conductive when the electrical potential between the electrodes is less than the material's breakdown voltage VB. Above that voltage it becomes conductive and supports a plasma discharge therethrough, effecting a sudden increase in conductivity between the electrodes for discharging high energy potentials with a plasma voltage foldback functionally analogous to the foldback behavior of the gas tube protector.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS TUBE VENT-SAFE DEVICEBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to the telecommunications industry, and more particularly to backup devices for gas tube protectors. Gas tube protectors are used to protect telecommunications equipment from electrical interference or damage resulting from high voltage lightning pulses. A gas contained in the tubes ionizes at high voltages to divert such pulses to ground. The tubes also maintain a limited sustained ionization in the presence of a continuing high current overload, such as from an accidental power line crossover. To assure the performance of such tubes in the rare event that the ionizable gas vents from the tube, and to add protection in the case of overheat failure during sustained over-current conditions, prevailing industry practice is to require so- called "vent-safe" and "fail-safe" mechanisms along with the basic gas tube protector itself. (The term "vent-safe" now commonly refers to backup over-voltage protection if the gas "vents" or is lost to the atmosphere. The term "fail-safe" now commonly refers to thermal overload protection, although the term taken literally cloaks this connotation.) Fail-safe protection is now commonly afforded by a fusible metallic or plastic material that, when heated due to the energy from the current overload, yields to a biased shorting member to provide a permanent current shunt around the gas tube. Vent-safe protection is usually provided by an air-gap in the external structure of the device. The air-gap is carefully dimensioned to require a firing potential considerably above the normal firing potential of the gas tube itself, so that a properly functioning gas tube will prevent the air-gap from firing. This is important since an over-voltage pulse usually fires harmlessly through a properly functioning gas tube, but may damage the air-gap (which is intended only as a safety backup). Such air-gaps are typically 

designed to fire at about twice the design firing voltage of the gas gap. An example of such a device may be found, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,212,047 (Napiorkowski, issued July 8, 1980).Unfortunately, it has been found that air-gap vent-safe protection schemes can become unreliable. Telecommunications installations are intended to remain serviceable, without attention or maintenance, for decades. Understandably, environmental conditions often cause the electrical characteristics of these air-gaps to become unstable over such long periods of time. For example, penetration of moisture
