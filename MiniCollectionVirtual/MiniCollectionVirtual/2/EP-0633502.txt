<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pattern
formation material used in the formation of a desired
pattern on a substrate in the production of a
semiconductor device. More particularly, it is concerned
with a material for the formation of a pattern that has a
particularly large exposure latitude and is less likely
to cause a dimensional change with a change in exposing
energy.Various chemical amplification resists are known in
the art. In this type of resist, a pattern is formed by
irradiating the resist with an active beam to produce an
acid, (heat-)decomposing or (heat-)crosslinking a polymer
in the presence of the resultant acid as a catalyst to
cause a change in solubility of the polymer. These
chemical amplification resists are described in, for
example, E. Reichmanis, S.A. MacDomald, T. Iwayanagi, ACS
Symp. Ser., 412, 25-112 (1989). They are known to have
relatively good sensitivity and resolution.It is also known to form a pattern by a method
which comprises combining a material capable of producing
an acid upon heating with a material capable of producing
a base upon irradiation with an active beam, effecting
heating after irradiation to heat-crosslink a polymer in
its unexposed portion in the presence of an acid produced
by the heating with the resultant acid in the polymer in
its exposed portion being neutralized with a base
produced by irradiation to inhibit heat-crosslinking
caused by the acid in the exposed portion. This resist
is described as a resist having a particularly high
sensitivity in, for example, S. Matuszczak et al, J.
Mater. Chem., 1, 1045 (1991).On the other hand, apart from the above-described
chemical amplification resists, a resist comprising a
photosensitive composition and, added thereto, a 
photochromic dye, such as spiropyran, is also known in
the art.For example, a proposal has been made on a method
wherein a photochromic dye having a sensitizing
capability or a photochromic dye having a desensitizing
capability is added to a resist to modify the sensitivity
(see Japanese Patent Publication No. 32662/1986).
Further examples of the above-described type of resist
include a resist material comprising a positive-working
resist and spiropyran added thereto for the purpose of
making it possible to form any of a positive-working
pattern or a negative-working pattern (see Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 35130/1981) and a photoresist having
improved adhesion to a substrate and resolution and
comprising a combination of a negative-working resist for
an electron beam with a
