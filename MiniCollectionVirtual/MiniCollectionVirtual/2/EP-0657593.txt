<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a planar and three-dimensional connecting system for connecting tension or compression bars in wood and steel construction work. The system comprises an anchor nut (10, 20) with a centrally arranged, stepped bore (12) for receiving a hexagon socket screw (14) which interacts with an internal thread in the end surface of a first structural part, and further comprises two plane-parallel side plates (24) which are arranged symmetrically and parallel with respect to the centre axis of the anchor nut (10, 20) and are connected, on the one hand, to the anchor nut (10, 20) and, on the other hand, either directly to the second structural part or to at least one second anchor nut (10, 20). The second anchor nut may likewise receive a hexagon socket screw (14), which interacts with an internal thread in the end surface of the second constructional part. As a junction point in planar systems, the connection system permits fully variable directions of the tension members, with the result that individual prefabrication of the junction points can be dispensed with.
