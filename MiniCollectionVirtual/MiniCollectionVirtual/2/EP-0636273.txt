<ABSTRACT>
A magnetorheological fluid composition comprising magnetosolid particles, magnetosoft particles, a stabilizer, and a carrying fluid comprising an aromatic alcohol, a vinyl ether, and an organic solvent or diluent carrier such as kerosene, in proportions sufficient to provide substantially no agglomeration or sedimentation of magnetic particles over temperatures of from about -50 to 120  DEG C. The composition can be made by preparing a carrying fluid comprising a vinyl ether, an aromatic alcohol and kerosene; preparing a first carrying fluid composition comprising magnetosoft particles, a stabilizer and a first sample of the carrying fluid; preparing a second carrying fluid composition comprising magnetosolid particles and a second sample of the carrying fluid; and admixing the first carrying fluid composition and the second carrying fluid composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetorheological 
fluids, and more particularly to fluids containing a 
suspension of material which will change the fluid 
properties when acted on by a magnetic field, and methods 
for making such fluids. Fluids containing magnetic material are known 
in the art. Such fluids are designed to change viscosity 
or other fluid properties upon application of a magnetic 
field to the fluid. Typical uses of known magnetic fluid 
compositions have included shock absorbers, clutches, and 
actuating modules. However, prior art fluids have 
suffered from several disadvantages. Prior art fluids 
generally are not useful over a wide range of 
temperature. Known magnetic fluids also have suffered 
from instability of the magnetic particles in suspension. 
Such instability can include settling of the particles 
over time due to gravitational forces and/or 
agglomeration of the particles in the fluid suspension. Shtarkman, U.S. Patent No. 4,992,190, describes 
a fluid responsive to a magnetic field comprising 
magnetizable particulate, silica gel as a dispersant and 
a vehicle. Shtarkman discloses a fluid composition 
comprising 20% by weight of silicone oil and 80% by 
weight of a mixture of carboxyl iron (99% by weight) and 
pre-dried silica gel (1% by weight). Shtarkman discloses 
that such a fluid is useful as the dampening fluid in a  
 
shock absorber. Shtarkman discloses that reduced magnetic 
particles can have an insulation coating (such as iron 
oxide) to prevent particle-to-particle contact, eddy 
currents or dielectric leakage. Fluids such as those described by Shtarkman 
have limited commercial applicability. The silicone oil 
vehicle is a poor lubricant, particularly on steel 
surfaces, and must be combined with lubricants and 
mineral oils to overcome this disadvantage. Moreover, the 
high compressibility of silicone oils is undesirable 
since it increases the time for system response to a 
magnetic field. Additionally, the silicone oils do not 
dissolve surfactants easily, precluding the use of non-organic 
stabilizers. Chagnon, U.S. Patent No. 4,356,098, describes a 
ferrofluid composition comprising a colloidal dispersion 
of finely-divided particles in a liquid silicone-oil 
carrier and a dispersing amount of a surfactant which 
comprises a silicone-oil surfactant containing a 
functional group which forms a chemical bond with the 
surface of the particles and a tail group which is 
soluble in the silicone-oil carrier. Fluids such as those 
disclosed by Chagnon suffer
