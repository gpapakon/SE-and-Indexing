<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a solid electrolytic 
capacitor using a conductive polymer as an electrolyte, 
which capacitor has superior capacitor characteristics, in 
particular, frequency characteristics and reliability 
characteristics under conditions of high temperature and 
high humidity. In recent years, as electrical equipment has been 
made digital, capacitors are also required to have a large 
capacity with compactness in size and also a low impedance 
at high frequency regions. Capacitors used at high 
frequency regions have hitherto included plastic film 
capacitors, mica capacitors, and laminated ceramic 
capacitors. These capacitors, however, necessarily have a 
large size and hence can be made to have a large capacity 
with difficulty. The laminated ceramic capacitors have 
also the disadvantage that the temperature characteristics 
may become poor as the capacitor is made more compact and 
made to have a larger capacity, resulting in a very high  
 
cost. On the other hand, those known as capacitors of a 
large capacity type include aluminum dry electrolytic 
capacitors, and aluminum or tantalum solid electrolytic 
capacitors. These capacitors can achieve a large capacity 
since the anode oxide film that serves as a dielectric can 
be made very thin, but, on the other hand, are required to 
be provided with an electrolyte between the oxide film and 
cathode for the purpose of repairing damage. In the 
aluminum conductive composition, when used, anode and 
cathode aluminum foils applied with etching are wound up 
interposing a separator and the separator is impregnated 
with a liquid electrolyte. Hence, they have the 
disadvantages such that a decrease of electrostatic 
capacity or increase of loss (tan δ) may increasingly 
occur with time because of leakage, evaporation or the 
like of the liquid electrolyte, and at the same time 
the high frequency characteristics and low temperature 
characteristics may become extremely poor because of 
the ion conductivity of the electrolyte. In the aluminum or tantalum solid electrolytic 
capacitors, manganese dioxide is used as a solid 
electrolyte so that the disadvantages in the above 
aluminum dry electrolytic capacitors can be better 
eliminated. This solid electrolyte is obtained by  
 
immersing an anode element in an aqueous manganese nitrate 
solution, followed by thermal decomposition at a 
temperature of from 250 to 350°C. In the case of this 
capacitor, the electrolyte is solid, and therefore can be 
free from the
