<ABSTRACT>
A system and method, including a mobile system, for the 
remediation of soil containing waste and carbonaceous 

material, especially for the remediation of a mixture of 
lead-contaminated soil and waste lead-acid battery casings, 

includes a plasma arc furnace (18) unit having a plasma arc torch 
which operates at a sufficiently elevated temperature to (i) 

convert part of the mixture into a combustible gas, (ii) 
volatilize contaminants such as lead which are present in the 

mixture and entrain the volatilized contaminants as a vapor in 
the combustible gas, and (iii) vitrify the soil, whereby 

contaminants that were present in the mixture are 
substantially removed therefrom. An internal combustion 

engine-driven generator (102a-102c) supplies the plasma arc furnace (18) 
with electrical power and receives combustible gas from the plasma 

arc furnace as a fuel source in order to drive the generator. 
The various units of the system may be mounted for mobility 

(e.g. on truck beds, rail cars or the like) to permit 
transportation to a landfill in need of remediation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process and 
system for the remediation of soil containing waste material. The present invention is especially well suited to the 
remediation of soil which is contaminated with lead and/or 
casings of lead-acid batteries and is primarily described 
herein with reference to that application. It may also 
usefully be employed in the remediation of landfill materials 
generally, for example in the remediation of landfills in 
which waste materials, such as waste paper and/or paperboard 
products, various metals, hydrocarbon fuels and/or chemical 
feedstocks, plastics materials or the like, are mixed with 
landfill soil. The safe treatment and disposal of all waste materials is 
demanded in most developed nations. In this regard, there is 
a growing demand on industry by environmentalists and 
government agencies to alleviate potentially toxic and/or 
contaminated waste disposal sites that were employed for many 
years prior to the public's heightened environmental concerns 
and the enactment of environmental legislation. For example, a number of now defunct lead-acid battery 
recycling sites were operated where lead was reclaimed from 
spent lead-acid batteries. At most such lead-acid battery 
recycling sites, the primary operation consisted of breaking 
the battery case, draining the spent acid, and separating from 
the battery cases the commercially valuable lead to be 
recycled. The broken battery cases, which were usually formed  
 
of a non-recyclable, hardened rubber material known as 
"ebonite", were of no commercial value and were thus typically 
discarded as landfill waste. However, it is now known that 
these discarded battery cases in landfills nonetheless were 
contaminated with sufficient quantities of lead that could 
detrimentally affect the environment. Various techniques have been proposed for the remediation 
of landfills containing lead-contaminated waste lead-acid 
battery casings. For example, The U.S. Bureau of Mines has 
proposed a chemical reclamation process for waste lead-acid 
battery casings whereby battery casing particles are 
carbonized by treatment in a sodium or ammonium carbonate 
solution followed by acid washing with nitric acetic or 
flurosilicic acids. See, "The Hazardous Waste Consultant", 
September/October 1991, pages 1.22-1.24. EP-A-0395397 describes known incineration processes, 
e.g. in which landfill material is burned along with other 
combustible material, typically municipal garbage, or a 
system in which the

A system for the remediation of soil containing waste 
material comprising: 


a plasma arc furnace (18) having a plasma arc torch 
(18d) which operates at a sufficiently elevated temperature to 

(i) convert the waste into a combustible gas, (ii) volatilize 
the waste material and entrain it as a vapor in the 

combustible gas, and (iii) vitrify the soil, whereby waste 
material is substantially removed therefrom, and further 

comprising combustion apparatus (104a-c) to receive and 
combust the combustible gas from said plasma arc furnace (18);
 
   characterised in that the combustion apparatus (104a-c) 

comprises one or more internal combustion engine-driven 
generators (102a-c) for supplying said plasma arc furnace (18) 

with electrical power. 
A system as in claim 1, further comprising a source of 
secondary fuel gas (110) which is supplied to said combustion 

apparatus (102a-c) as a supplemental fuel together with said 
combustible gas generated by said plasma arc furnace. 
A system as in claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising 
a solids filtration unit (106) interposed between said plasma 

arc furnace and said combustion apparatus (104a-c). 
A system as in any preceding claim, further 
comprising a soil preparation unit (124) which includes a soil 

drier for soil to be fed to said plasma arc furnace unit (18).  
 
A system as in any preceding claim, further 
comprising a slag processing unit (126) for processing the 

vitrified soil discharged from the plasma arc furnace unit 
(18). 
A system as in claim 5, wherein said slag processing 
unit (126) includes a crusher for comminuting the vitrified 

soil. 
A system as in claim 6, wherein said slag processing
