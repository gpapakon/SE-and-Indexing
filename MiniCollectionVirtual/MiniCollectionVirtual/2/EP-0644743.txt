<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a procedure to maintain an otherwise whole tooth, from which the nerve has been removed by carrying out a procedure which includes inserting a thin flexible post (11), preferably formed of a light-transmitting, physiologically inert material, to the full depth of a prepared relatively narrow tooth nerve canal (8), which has previously been sealed at its bottom with gutta percha (12). The post is then surrounded by a film of a composite-filler or sealant (16), which is preferably light-curable, cotating the post while supporting and sealing the walls of the canal. The post is sufficiently flexible as to be able to follow the curvature of the canal, which may retain a slight natural curvature. The composite filler or sealant is then cured, preferably by an optical radiation carried through the preferably transparent post.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a dental post which is formed of a
relatively soft and plastic polymer, and which is
light-transmitting, and can provide centering for the
forming of a bracing filler to reinforce internally the
walls of pulpless roots while providing for access to the
canal in endodontic retreatment procedures.It is well known art in the dental field to remove
an injured nerve, and fill the root apex with gutta percha,
preparatory to other reconstructive procedures, including
filling the canal with a hard cement material. It is also
common, where the coronal part of the tooth is missing or
severely damaged, to grind away the diseased remaining upper
surface of the tooth so as to provide an appropriate form
for a dental prosthesis to be anchored to the tooth via a
cast metal anchor extending into the widened root canal.
Such dental anchors are generally cemented into the bore
hole, or may be held by screw-threads, and in some cases the
anchors are provided with textured or undulating lateral
surfaces to further assist in securing the anchor to the
cement. It has been found, however, that the strength of
the repaired tooth, or the security of the dental
prosthesis, may be compromised by a severely enlarged canal,
with thin remaining walls; in such condition the root may
not be sufficiently strong to support a prosthesis, even
where the root was firmly anchored in the jaw bone.Presently, such problems when found in roots with
flared and wide canals and with thin, unsupported walls,
require further widening and reshaping of the canal to form
a continuous straight internal surface, and then filling the
space with custom shaped cast metal posts with an extending
core foundation above the root for attaching a coronal
replacement. However, the difficulties created by the bulky 
metal post surrounded by thin walled roots are often the
cause of split roots requiring the extracting of its
fragments and a replacement with costlier implants and
prosthetic devices. Another objection and difficulty with
metal cast posts, is the unavoidable metal shadow
transmitted through the thin root walls and their
surrounding soft tissues, which is an impairment to
achieving esthetic results, especially in the visible
anterior (front) teeth. Further, such individually
fashioned cast posts add additional cost, and require a
greater number of costly office visits by the patient.It was also known to use pins, or posts, formed
from polymeric plastics, for the formation of dental
fixtures, for example, by casting by

<CLAIMS>
A dental tool post for reinforcing an obturated tooth and root, the post being formed
of a physiologically inert, optically transmitting polymeric material, characterised in that the

dental tool post (11) comprises a substantially cylindrical shank portion (13) with an inwardly
tapering, or convergent, first end (15), and in that the post is formed of a flexible polymeric

material, sufficiently flexible to follow the natural curvature of the natural root canal.
The tool post of Claim 1, wherein the convergent first end (15) of the post includes
a transverse cross-section having a diameter not greater than the diameter of a natural root

canal.
The tool post of Claim 1, wherein the tool post further comprises an internal
circumferential surface defining a channel extending substantially axially longitudinally

through the post, and a relatively movable rod (17) extending into and through the axial
channel and beyond the convergent first end, the central rod being an optical fiber material.
The tool post of Claim 3, further comprising a reflective, non-transmitting surface
formed on the first end of the optical rod (17).
The tool post of any preceding Claim, wherein the tool post further comprises
transverse grooves (19) formed on the circumferential surface of the shank portion.
