<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to an adjustable periurethral tensor which consists of a 
one-piece element which does not require additional fittings that would bring about 

leakages. This enables the withdrawal and introduction of serum without additional 
surgical intervention and permits ideal control of the pressure on the urethra, thus 

aiding the sphincter to close. 
The tensor consists of a supporting plate (3) having medical grade silicon layers and 
an inner reinforcement (4) made from polyester fibers such as Dacron
(R)
. A hole (5), 
fastening pins (6) and an inflatable envelope (8) are provided in the supporting plate 

(3). The plate (3) is connected to a valve (9) through a connecting pipe (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an adjustable periurethral tensor. In the prior art, the solution envisaged for patients with sphincter functional problems 
was the use of an artificial sphincter comprised of an assembly made of several 
parts connected to one another. The most common example is a bag having 
predetermined sizes which is disposed around the sphincter. On filling same by 
means of a pump normally located in the scrotum or vagina, the bag shall be filled 
wih physiological serum, which will constrict the sphincter. Said device poses several problems such as the bending of the connecting pipe 
between the constricting bag and the pump and the loss of initial serum due to the 
natural porosity of silicon, a material which is usually used and which cannot be 
replaced as it would require further surgery. Additionally, in view of the great number of fittable parts, there may occur leakages 
and flaws in the numerous connections. Another serious problem detected is the 
tissue necrosis due to the overpressure exerted on the urethra. In the prior art, a process is known for injecting Teflon(R). (beads), collagen or other 
materials with the aim of artificially producing an obstruction. Said process has 
several drawbacks, namely, the difficulty in obtaining precision at the stage of 
injecting such materials; the impossibility of removing them subsequently even when 
it is not a surgical process, or regulating the intensity of the thus produced 
obstruction, as owing to the fact that an empirically determined amount of such 
materials is injected it is impossible to foresee with accuracy the final result of the 
obstruction. The object of the present invention is to solve the problems of the art by providing a 
one-piece periurethral tensor which shall prevent any leakages. Another object is to provide the tensor with a valve for allowing the withdrawal and 
injecting of physiological serum or any other suitable means, enabling a pressure 
control without the need of further surgery. Another object is to provide a tensor which contrary to the ones in the current art that 
only allow for the sphincter to open and close, can help the sphincter to close, and  
 
enable to use it in patients lacking partial or total voluntary muscle control, for 
instance, paraplegics, patients with congenital or old age incontinence. Anoher object is to provide a tensor which enables a precise control even in patients 
lacking total voluntary muscle control, wherein the patient himself may use the 
catheter

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable periurethral tensor (1) having a valve (9) for inserting and removing 
fluid and a connecting pipe (2) for conveying fluid, wherein the tensor is 

comprised of a supporting plate (3) having a hole (5) in an end thereof and a 
plurality of fastening pins (6) on its other end, the supporting plate (3) being 

provided with an inflatable envelope (8) on the opposite face of the pins (6), 
which envelope extends through a portion of the plate (3). 
A tensor according to claim 1°, wherein the envelope (8) receives fluid through a 
valve (9) and pipe (2), the pipe (2) being connected to the plate (3) by a fitting 

(2a) and to the valve (9) by a connection (2b). 
A tensor according to claim 1°, wherein the valve (9) is provided with an outer 
casing (10) and a core which define a reservoir suitable for receiving the fluid 

which is to be transferred to the envelope (8). 
A tensor according to claim 1°, wherein each of the fastening pins (6) is provided 
with a step (7) for fitting in the hole (5), the fitting of the pins (6) in the hole (5) 

being variable due to the tensor adjustment. 
A tensor according to claim 1°, wherein the plate (3) is provided with layers of an 
inert flexible material having an inner reinforcement (4) made of polyester fibres 

such as Dacron(R).. 
A tensor according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5° wherein the tensor (1) is fully made 
from an inert flexible material, preferably a medical grade silicon.
