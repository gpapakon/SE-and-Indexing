<ABSTRACT>
Grooved block (1) which can be pivoted into grooves of profiled bars or the like, said grooves being undercut in a T-shaped manner, and exhibits an essentially wedge-shaped cross-section having a wedge vertex line (1') which, in the pivoted-in state, is directed towards the profile groove base and bears thereon with a clamping location (6), and further exhibits a threaded bore (3) running perpendicularly to said wedge vertex line. In order to provide a grooved block (1), of the generic type mentioned in the introduction, which can be produced in a simpler and less expensive manner, said groove block is designed such that it has a plastic resilient bracket arm (5) which extends longitudinally in the region of its wedge vertex line (1') and exhibits, at its free, resiliently compliant end (5'), the clamping location (6) which bears on the profile groove base.

<CLAIMS>
Tenon block, which can be inserted into grooves (7), which are undercut in a
T-shaped manner, of profiled bars (8) or the like, having a substantially wedge-shaped

cross-section, having a spring bracket arm (5) which consists of synthetic
material, is formed by a longitudinal slot (4), extends in the longitudinal direction

of the tenon block and comprises a clamping site (6), and having a screw-threaded
bore (3), which extends in a perpendicular manner with respect to the

longitudinal slot (4), characterised in that the spring bracket arm (5) is disposed
in the region of a wedge apex line (1') of the tenon block, which can be pivoted

into the groove, and said spring bracket arm comprises (5) [sic] on its free,

resiliently flexible end (5') the clamping site, and that the screw-threaded bore (3)
is disposed outside a region (1a) which is formed by the longitudinal slot (4).
Tenon block according to claim 1, characterised in that the clamping site (6)
consists of a clamping knob which is integrally formed on the lower side on the

free end (5') of the synthetic material spring bracket arm (5).
Tenon block according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it comprises a
synthetic material base part (1) which has a wedge-shaped cross-section and

which is divided approximately in half in the longitudinal direction, comprises on
the one side the fork region (1a), which is provided with the longitudinal slot (4) in

order to form the spring bracket arm (5), and comprises on the other side a bore
receiving region (1b) which is provided with a metallic insert bushing (2) which

contains the screw-threaded bore (3).
Tenon block according to claim 3, characterised in that the synthetic material
base part (1) is provided in its bore receiving region (1b) with a through-going

receiving bore (9), which contains the metallic insert bushing (2), and said base
part is provided with a flat recess which is disposed above said receiving bore

and on which lies the metallic insert bushing (2) which is provided with a
corresponding edge flange (2'). 
Tenon block according to claim 4, characterised in that projections (11, 12),
which prevent any rotational movement, are integrally formed on the upper side

of the synthetic material base part (1) on both sides of the metallic insert bushing
(2) which contains the screw-threaded bore (3).
Tenon block according to claim 5, characterised in that the edge flange (2'),
which is provided on the metallic insert bushing (2), is formed with a rectangular

contour and clamping edges are provided on the edges (11', 12'), facing said
edge flange, of the projections (11, 12), which prevent any rotational movement,

of the base part (1), said clamping edges engaging over the corresponding
edges of the edge flange (2') so as to perform a slight clamping function.
