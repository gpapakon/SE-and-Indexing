<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic light-sensitive emulsion is 
disclosed. The photographic material comprises a support and a 

silver halide emulsion layer provided on the support, and at 
least 30 % of the total projection area of the silver halide 

grains contained in the silver halide emulsion layer is 
occupied by that of tabular silver halide grains having an 

aspect ratio of not less than 2; and the support comprises 
polyethylene-2-6-naphthalate and has a thickness of 70 µm to 

120 µm. The photographic material is inhibited in the 
formation of roller mark in an automatic processor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a black and white silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material of high sensitivity
which has little pressure fogging and which has few roller
marks even in hardening-free high temperature rapid
processing.In the field of medical photographic light-sensitive
materials, in particular, high sensitivity and high image
quality are essential requirements of patient disease
diagnosis.It is known to use tabular silver halide grains to
achieve high sensitivity and high image quality. Tabular
grains offer advantages such as improved spectral
sensitization efficiency and improved image granularity and
sharpness, and are disclosed, for instance, in British Patent 
No. 2,112,157 and US Patent Nos. 4,439,520, 4,433,048,
4,414,310 and 4,434,226.However, tabular silver halide grains are faulty in that
fogging is likely when they are compressed. As means of
overcoming this drawback, some methods have been proposed in
which silver halide grains are prepared having a core of
higher iodine content or incorporating a latex. However, the
former approach does not offer a perfect solution because of
pressure desensitization, resulting in nothing more than a
balance between mutually opposite features called pressure
blackening and pressure desensitization. The latter approach
has drawbacks such as deterioration of the driability of the
light-sensitive material upon processing because of the
increased amount of binder.Also, methods of eliminating the hardening in the course
of processing are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter referred to as Japanese
Patent O.P.I. Publication) Nos. 111933/1983 and 206750/1988,
in which tabular silver halide grains are used at a
hydrophilic colloid layer swelling rate below 200%. In fact,
the driability improves and the degree of hardening can be
lowered when tabular grains are used at a hydrophilic colloid
layer swelling rate of not higher than 200%. However,
hardener-free processing results in an extremely increased
number of roller marks, or roller pressure traces occurring in
the developer, so that no satisfactory results are obtained 
solely by reducing the light-sensitive material swelling
rate below 200%.JP-2089045 discloses a silver halide light sensitive
material comprising a polyester film substrate and silver
halide emulsion layers. JP-61205137 discloses a biaxially
oriented polyester film for eletrophotographic materials
which is prepared by coating a polyester film with a
coating agent containing
