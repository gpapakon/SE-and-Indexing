<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns fiber optic 
system phase modulators and, more particularly, 
arrangements for accommodating such phase modulation of 
electromagnetic waves traveling therein in changing 
conditions. Fiber optic gyroscopes are an attractive means 
with which to sense rotation of an object supporting 
such a gyroscope. Such gyroscopes can be made quite 
small and can be constructed to withstand considerable 
mechanical shock, temperature change, and other 
environmental extremes. Due to the absence of moving 
parts, they can be nearly maintenance free, and they 
have the potential of becoming economical in cost. They 
can also be sensitive to low rotation rates that can be 
a problem in other kinds of optical gyroscopes. A fiber optic gyroscope has a coiled optical 
fiber wound on a core and about the axis thereof around 
which rotation is to be sensed. The optical fiber is 
typical of a length of 100 to 2,000 meters, or so, and 
is part of a closed optical path in which an 
electromagnetic wave, or light wave, is introduced and 
split into a pair of such waves to propagate in opposite 
directions through the coil to both ultimately impinge 
on a photodetector. Rotation about the sensing axis of 
the core, or the coiled optical fiber, provides an 
effective optical path length increase in one rotational 
direction and an optical path length decrease in the 
other rotational direction for one of these waves. The 
opposite result occurs for rotation in the other 
direction. Such path length differences between the  
 
waves introduce a phase shift between these waves for 
either rotation direction, i.e. the well-known Sagnac 
effect. The use of a coiled optical fiber is desirable 
because the amount of phase difference shift due to 
rotation, and so the output signal, depends on the 
length of the entire optical path through the coil 
traversed by the two electromagnetic waves travelling in 
opposed direction, and so a large phase difference can 
be obtained in the long optical fiber but in the 
relatively small volume taken by it as a result of being 
coiled. The output current from the photodetector 
system photodiode, in response to the opposite direction 
traveling electromagnetic waves impinging thereon after 
passing through the coiled optical fiber, follows a 
raised cosine function. That is, the output current 
depends on the cosine of the phase difference between 
these two waves. Since a cosine function is an even 
function, such an output function gives no indication as 
to the
