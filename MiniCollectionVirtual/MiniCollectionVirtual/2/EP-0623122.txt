<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel benzopyran and other 
benzo-fused leukotriene B4 (LTB4) antagonists, to 
pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and 
to a method of using such compounds as LTB4 antagonists. The compounds of this invention inhibit the action of 
LTB4 and are therefore useful in the treatment of LTB4 
induced illnesses such as inflammatory disorders including 
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, psoriasis and other skin disorders such as eczema, 
erythma, pruritis and acne, stroke and other forms of 
reperfusion injury, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases, 
asthma, and other conditions where marked neutrophil 
infiltration occurs. Leukotriene B4 antagonists are disclosed in European 
patent publications 276 064 and 292 977 which refer to 
diphenylethers, benzophenones, and other compounds 
containing two phenyl groups, and 7-(3-alkoxy-4-alkanoylphenoxy)alkoxy 
benzopyran derivatives, respectively. European patent publication no 0404440 and US patent 
5059609 describe certain substituted tetralin and chroman 
derivatives and related compounds as leukotriene antagonists 
and 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors, useful in the treatment 
of asthma, arthritis and related diseases. Tet. Letters, 1980, 21, 2069-2072 describes a process for 
the regeoselective lithiation of II-arene chromium 
tricarbonyl complexes to yield various tetrahydronaphthalene 
derivatives. No biological activity is mentioned.  
 According to the invention, it was found that the 
following compounds of formula I have LTB4 antagonistic 
properties: 
 
wherein A is O, CH2, S, NH, or N(C1-C6 alkyl) ; n is O, 1 or 2; 
R1 is a substituent at position b or c as follows: 
carboxy; cis or trans -(CH2)m-CR4=CR5-CO2H;  
 
 
wherein m is 0, 1 or 2, R' is carboxy, 
tetrazolyl or CH2OH, and X is O, CH2, S, NH or N(C1-C6 alkyl); 
-(CH2)mCR4R5R6 wherein m is as defined above; R4 and R5 are 
hydrogen or each independently are C1-C6 alkyl, or are taken 
together with the carbons to which they are attached to form 
C3-C7 cycloalkyl; R6 is hydroxyl, carboxy, tetrazolyl, or - 
CONR7R8 wherein R7 and R8 are hydrogen or each independently 
are C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C4 perfluoroalkyl, C1-C6 alkylsulfinyl, 
phenylsulfinyl, C1-C6 alkylsulfonyl, phenylsulfonyl, R9-substituted 
phenyl or hydroxy, except that R7 and R8 cannot 
be both hydroxy, or R7 is hydrogen and R8 is 4-hydroxybutyl, 
or R7 and R8 is (CH2)4; R2, R9,R15, and R16 are hydrogen or each 
independently are one or any two of the following: fluoro,
