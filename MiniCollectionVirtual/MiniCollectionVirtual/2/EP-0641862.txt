presence of an enzyme source which is derived from a 
microorganism belonging to the genus 
Dactylosporangium
 or 

Amycolatopsis

into trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline
, a divalent iron ion 
and 2-ketoglutaric acid, in an aqueous medium, and the 

produced trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline is collected from the 
aqueous medium. Also provided is a novel enzyme L-proline-4-hydroxylase,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline. Trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline
is useful as a starting compound for medicines and an
additive to foods. The present invention also relates to a
novel enzyme capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of L-proline
at the 4-position of L-proline. The novel enzyme is
used in the above-mentioned process.There have heretofore been known microbiological
processes of producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline as follows:
1) A method of producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline from
4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric acid using microorganisms belonging to
the genus Escherichia (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent
Application No. 266995/91),2) A method of producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline
using fungi (EP 0547898 A2), and3) A method of producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline by
enzymatically hydroxylating L-proline using microorganisms
belonging to the genus Streptomyces (J. Biol. Chem., 254, 6684
- 6690, 1979; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 120, 45 - 51,
1984).Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 66 no. 524 80 p & Arch. Biochem. Biophys., Vol. 118(1) 1967, pp 231-240 discloses proline hydroxylase from animal tissues which catalyses the reaction of peptidyl proline to peptidylhydroxyproline.The methods are not suitable in the industrially
application because in the first method, 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric
acid is expensive and the productivity of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline
is extremely low; in the second method the
productivity of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline is extremely low,
and in the third method, the enzymatic activity is so weak
that the final product could not be detected without using a
radioactive compound.Heretofore, an enzyme capable of catalyzing the 
hydroxylation of L-proline into trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline
(hereinafter referred to as L-proline-4-hydroxylase) has not
been isolated. A process for producing trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline,
using an enzyme source which is isolated from a
microorganism belonging to the genus Dactylosporangium or
Amycolatopsis and which catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-proline
into trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, has not been known.
Although there was a paper reporting that L-proline-4-hydroxylase
was isolated from a microorganism belonging to the
genus Streptomyces (Tetrahedron Letters, 34, 7489 - 7492,
1993), the report is silent about steps for isolating the
enzyme, the enzyme purity, the physicochemical properties of
the enzyme, etc.The object of the present invention is to provide an
efficient process for the production of
