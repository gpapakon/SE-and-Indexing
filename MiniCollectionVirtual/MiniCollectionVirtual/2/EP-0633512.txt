<ABSTRACT>
In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus 
having an image carrier (12) for forming an electrostatic 

latent image thereon, a charging device has a charging 
member (10) facing the image carrier and spaced apart 

therefrom by a predetermined gap (G), and a power source 
(20) for applying a predetermined voltage to the charging 

member. The charging member comprises a conductive support 
(14), and a conductive fibrous member (16) affixed to the 

surface of the conductive support which faces the image 
carrier. The conductive fibrous member may be formed of 

a treated nonwoven fabric, a regularly woven webbing, or 
electrically implanted bristles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
image forming apparatus having an image carrier for forming
an electrostatic latent image thereon and, more particularly,
to a charging device for charging the image carrier.Electrophotographic copiers, laser printers and
facsimile machines belong to a family of electrophotographic
image forming apparatuses having an image carrier in the
form of a photoconductive drum or a photoconductive belt.
Electrophotographic methods for this type of image forming
apparatus include an indirect electrophotographic method
which charges the surface of the image carrier uniformly,
exposes the charged surface to image data, e.g., a reflection
from an original document to form an electrostatic latent
image thereon, develops the latent image by a toner or similar
developer, transfers the resulting toner image to a plain
paper or similar recording medium, and then fixes the toner
image on the medium by heat and pressure. A direct
electrophotographic method is another conventional
electrophotographic method and uses a recording medium 
itself as an image carrier. This kind of method charges the
surface of the medium uniformly and then sequentially
executes the exposing, developing and fixing steps with the
medium. In any case, the electrophotographic method charges
the surface of the image carrier uniformly at the beginning of
image formation.To charge the surface of the image carrier uniformly, as
stated above, various kinds of charging devices are available
and may generally be classified into devices using corona
discharge, devices using a brush, and devices using a roller. A
corona discharge type charging device deposits a charge on
the surface of the image carrier with one or more wires for
corona discharge. Specifically, this type of device has a
shield having an opening facing the image carrier, and one or
more tungsten wires or gold-plated tungsten wires disposed
in the shield. A high voltage of 4 kV to 7 kV in absolute value
is applied to the wires to effect corona discharge. Among
this type of charging devices, a scorotron charger is provided
with a grid electrode between the wires and the image carrier
in order to promote uniform and stable charging.On the other hand, a brush type charging device has a
conductive brush connected to a power source and made of
metal or conductive resin. The brush is held in contact with
the image carrier for charging the surface of the image
carrier. This type of device differs from the corona discharge 
type device in that it
