<DESCRIPTION>
 A CLEANSING AND STERILIZATION MECHANISM Bac crround of the Invention:This invention relates generally to cleansing and sterilization of items and more particularly to the cleansin and sterilization of items through the use of ozone.Although this invention has tremendous applications to variety of items to be cleaned including but not limited to, dental tools, surgical instruments, implants, etc., for an understanding of the problems associated with cleansing and sterilization, the following discussion focusses on the cleansing and sterilization of contact lenses.The success or tragic failure of contact lens wear is ultimately determined by the care and aseptic handling of the lenses. With over seventeen million contact lens wearers in the United States spending two billion dollars on contact len supplies, a simple one step cleaning and sterilizing process is sought. Both hard and soft lenses currently need daily, o in the case of extended wear contacts, weekly cleaning and antiseptic treatment. By their very nature, being in close relationship with the wearer for extended periods of time, contact lenses are susceptible to both: buildups of protein and lipids from the wearer; and also from contamination from microorganisms. Either of these, buildup or contamination, can have debilitating affects such as reduced vision, scarring of the eye, and even blindness.Hydrophilic contact lenses, being soft and composed mainly of water, have made the problem of cleaning even more difficult. Physical pressure on the hydrophilic lense may cause rips; strong disinfectants become lodged within the bod of hydrophilic lense itself and then irritate the wearer's ey causing an ulcer.Without a good cleaning process, both the hard and soft contact lense is susceptible to a wide variety of contaminating microorganisms including: Acanthamoeba,Pseudomonas organisms, Alcaligenes faecalis, staph, Aureus, and Enterobacter aerogenes.
