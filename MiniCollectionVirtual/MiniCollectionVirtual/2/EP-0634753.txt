<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a locking assembly (14) for locking in 
place an upper support plate (12) above a typical nuclear fuel bundle. 

The locking assembly (14) includes several different components, 
including one rotatable member (28) that is movable between a first 

position for locking the support plate (12) in place and an unlocked 
position for releasing the support plate (12) so that it can be removed 

from the guide tubes (10) in the fuel bundle assembly. The rotatable 
member (28) is resiliently maintained at its locked and released 

positions, and the entire locking assembly (14) is an integral unit 
without any loose part regardless of the position of the rotatable 

member (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
locking assembly for permitting easy removal of 
fuel rods from a nuclear power reactor bundle 
according to the introductory part of claim 1 or 2. There are several types of nuclear reactors used 
to generate power, one of which is the pressurized water 
reactor (PWR). In a PWR the reactor core contains an array 
of fuel bundles or assemblies comprised of fuel rods 
containing uranium. PWR units in the United States generally operate 
for approximately 12 to 18 months after which the plant is 
routinely shut down for refueling so that all systems and 
components can be checked to ensure safety and reliability. 
Occasionally, fuel will fail during the 12 to 18 months of 
power operation. Fuel is considered failed when a fuel rod 
wall is breached and radioactive isotopes are released into 
the water which cools the fuel during power operation. 
Failure can result in a number of ways, such as debris in 
the cooling water fretting the fuel rod in a localized area, 
or flaws introduced during fuel fabrication. In the past, a small percentage of failed fuel was 
acceptable, but, recently, emphasis has been placed on 
eliminating the continued operation of any known failed 
fuel. When fuel fails, radioactive isotopes are released 
into the coolant water and should the level of these  
 
radioactive isotopes indicate that there is failed fuel, 
such failed fuel should be promptly removed. Rather than remove an entire fuel assembly from 
further operation, a more economical solution is to replace 
only the failed fuel rods with structurally sound 
replacement rods and return the assembly back to operation. 
The fuel rods are replaced by disconnecting an upper support 
plate or upper end fitting from guide tubes forming part of 
the fuel assembly, thereby allowing the fuel rods to be 
removed. The replacement or removal of failed fuel rods 
occurs during the outage when time to perform such work is 
limited, and, therefore, a need exists for fuel assembly 
features which allow replacement to be performed as quickly 
as possible. Early fuel assembly designs did not provide a 
means for replacement since some failed fuel was acceptable. 
However, as emphasis was placed on removal of failed fuel, 
designs were developed to allow replacement. For example, Long et al U.S. Patent No. 4,064,004 
discloses an assembly mechanism which permits the upper 
support plate to be removed from guide tubes and which 
includes a pair of cooperating movable members, one of which 
is operable to

second locking portion is fixed to said base portion (18) and 
including a projection (26) extending outwardly therefrom, 

said first locking portion (28) being disposed intermediate 
said projection (26) and said support plate (12) and being  

 
rotatable between a first position at which said slot (32) 

therein is openly aligend with said slot (24) in said support 
plate (12) to permit said support plate (12) to pass over 

said projection (26) for removal, and a second position at 
which said slot (32) therein is out of alignment with said 

slot (24) in said support plate (12) and said body portion is 
disposed between said projections (26) and said suppport 

plate (12) to prevent removal of said support plate (12) over
