<ABSTRACT>
System for fitting a set of rings in receiving grooves carried by a piston head of a combustion engine, in which a means for bringing up and centring the set of rings is associated with a device (58) for radially deforming and for holding these rings in fitted sliding supports (21, 22, 23) in parallel planes of the grooves for receiving the rings, characterised in that a sliding support (21) carries slideways (55) for guiding separating inserts (shims, spacers) (57) of two laminar rings (52, 53), a means (60) for controlling the movement of the said inserts (57) with respect to the side wall of a laminar ring and an axial stop (59) of the side wall of the said ring which can move between its bearing position on the inserts (57) and its stop position on the sliding support (21).
