<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cartridge filters for use in filter 
systems designed to remove solid particles or dust from large 
volumes of gases, including air, in which they are suspended, such 
as industrial sweepers, bag houses, plenum type dust collectors, 
and the like. Filtration systems which employ cartridge filters employ a 
porous filter material through which the gaseous medium passes, the 
solids being retained on the upstream surface of the filter medium 
as the gases pass through. The separated solids build up on the 
upstream side of the filter medium with time and must be removed 
before the thickness of the accumulated solids layer causes 
excessive pressure drop. In current practice, the filter cake is 
dislodged from the filter elements by means of a pulse of 
compressed air admitted to the filter element, a reverse air flow, 
or a shaker mechanism. The filter medium flexes under the force of 
the air pulse to dislodge the filter cake and the flow of gases 
being filtered is maintained while such flexing and dislodging is 
taking place. Cartridge filters generally have a folded or pleated filter 
medium arranged cylindrically around a perforated cylindrical 
supporting member or tube. The supporting tubes and filter medium 
are adhered to end caps which prevent leakage around the filter 
medium and provide support for the filter medium. For the most part, felts and fabrics have been used as the 
filter media with the addition of paper and other nonwoven 
backings. Cartridges of these types typically pack pleats very 
close together, e.g. 7-12 pleats per inch, for two reasons: (1) to  
 
maximize filter media surface area, and (2) to improve physical 
strength of the thin filter media where each pleat is unsupported 
to the cartridge during operation and cleaning. An example is found in USP 4,878,930 to Manniso, et al . which 
uses an expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane 
laminated to a felt or fabric and which is supported by a wire 
backing. The pleat spacing is greater than typically used with 
other filter media due to the fact that ePTFE membranes are more 
easily cleaned. On the cleaning cycle, it is important to leave 
enough space to allow dust (dirt, product, etc.) to exit the pleat 
space. This is the reason why ePTFE membrane filter cartridges are 
ruggedly supported, to allow the spacing for efficient cleaning 
while supporting the relatively open pleat that could not be 
supported by conventional means. It was, therefore, felt that a 
lightweight media

<CLAIMS>
A pleated filter cartridge consisting essentially of: 

a) a perforated support tube, 
b) a pleated filter medium around said tube, comprising a 
laminate of a nonwoven or felt backing and an expanded porous 

polytetrafluoroethylene, 
c) end caps into which the ends of the filter medium, and 
the tube is sealed, 
 
   characterized in that the pleated filter medium has less than 

seven pleats per inch (2.75 pleats per cm). 
The cartridge of Claim 1 wherein the cartridge can withstand a 
grain loading of at least 2 grains per cubic foot (4.5 mg per 

liter).
