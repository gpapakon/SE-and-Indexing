<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle operated remote control access system (C) for obtaining access to a controlled environment using the headlight system (32) of a vehicle having a high beam operation and a low beam operation. The remote control access system (C) comprises a switching sensor circuit (44, 52, 50, 48, 56) for detecting a sequence of switching from a low beam to a high beam operation or from a high beam to a low beam operation of the vehicle. Two or more of these switching sequences may be employed in the present invention. A timing means (62) is provided with the circuit (44, 52, 50, 48, 56) in order to determine if a switching sequence from a low beam operation and then from a high beam operation back to a low beam operation, and possibly with a second sequence of back to high beam and then low beam operation, occurred within a predetermined time interval. If the one or more required switching sequence did occur in this time interval, then the remote control system (C) is energized to open a gate or a door. If the switching from the low beam to the high beam and back to the low beam did not occur within the predetermined time interval then no energization of the remote control system (C) will occur and the system resets to neutral.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to certain new and 
useful improvements in vehicle operated remote control 
systems and more particularly, to vehicle operated remote 
control systems which utilize the headlight system of a 
vehicle having a high beam and a low beam operation by 
switching therebetween. Remote access opening, such as garage door and gate 
opening from automotive vehicles has become very popular 
and various remote access systems are now in widespread 
use. Most of the conventional remote control access 
systems utilize a garage door or a gate opener which is 
controlled by a radio frequency beam emitted from a 
transmitter located within the vehicle, see e.g. US-A-4 496 942. Essentially all of the conventional remote control 
access systems now in use employ a hand-held remote control 
transmitter which is operated to cause the opening or 
closing of the garage door or gate when the vehicle is 
located within proximity to the opener. One of the significant problems with the present 
commercially available remote control access systems is the 
fact that a hand-held transmitter is required for accessing 
the gate or door. Frequently, these hand-held remote 
control units are either clipped to a sun visor of the 
vehicle or stored in the glove compartment or otherwise 
placed in some other unobtrusive location. However, in 
many cases they are misplaced and the user of the remote 
control system must then conduct a search of his or her 
vehicle in order to locate the hand-held transmitter. In addition to the foregoing, there is the ever 
present problem of theft of the remote control transmitter. 
Since the remote control transmitter is, in effect, a key, 
theft of this device would enable a thief to obtain access  
 
to the controlled area. If the thief or potential thief 
knows of the location of the controlled access area, then 
such thief could on occasion lift the transmitter from the 
vehicle and use the same on a subsequent occasion. It would be desirable to provide a remote control 
system which enables access to a controlled area and which 
is not visible from the exterior of the vehicle and also 
cannot be readily removed from a vehicle. Further, US-A-2 914 709 discloses the use of headlights 
from a vehicle incident upon photoelectric sensors in a 
garage and which thereby causes actuation of the garage 
door opener to open or close the garage door when the 
lights of the car are turned on and off at a rapid 
rate or in a coded sequence. Photoelectric systems of the prior art
