<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels flowing through a magnetically permeable fuel feed line (delivery line, supply line) by means of a magnetic field which is applied to the fuel with the aid of an external means of magnetisation, and to a device for carrying out this method. For the purpose of optimal reduction of the fuel consumption, even in the case of different operating conditions, in the said method it is proposed according to the invention to apply to the fuel an electromagnetic alternating field having a periodically variable field strength and whose frequency is selected taking account of the flow velocity of the fuel. It is possible in this case for the frequency of the alternating field to be varied continuously within a frequency range between two limiting frequency values. As a result, matching of the frequency to the flow velocity is achieved even when the latter varies during operation. Instead of this, it is even more favourable to measure the instantaneous flow velocity of the fuel and, as a function of this, respectively to set the most favourable frequency, which is preferably stored and interrogated, and to control or regulate it. In the said device, it is proposed according to the invention for the purpose of carrying out this method to provide the magnet coil (field coil) surrounding the fuel feed line with an adequate length and to provide a supply source which feeds said coil with an alternating current (preferably approximately rectangular) of suitable variable frequency.
