<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed towards a flow-guiding apparatus, equipped with several guide blades, for centrifugal pumps which have to deliver liquids containing admixtures. A flow-guiding apparatus (7) working free of obstruction and in a low-loss manner is characterised according to the invention by the combination of the following features which applies to each guide blade (8):   a) the guide-blade nose (10) is well rounded off, the ratio of the rounding-off radius (r) to the width (b) of the guide blade (8) in the inlet area of the flow-guiding apparatus (7) being 0.15 to 0.5; b) the setting angle ( alpha s) of the guide blade (8) in the inlet area of the flow-guiding apparatus (7) corresponds to the direction of the tangent (11) to the path curve (12) of a fluid particle in the delivery liquid; c) the pressure side (13) of the guide blade (8) is set steeper than the suction side (14) by such an amount that the liquid always flows against the guide blade (8) in partial load.

Guide apparatus (7), fitted with a plurality of 
guide blades (8), for centrifugal pumps which have to 

pump liquids containing admixtures, characterized by the 
combination of the following features which holds for 

each guide blade (8): 

a) the guide blade nose (10) is strongly rounded, the 
ratio of the rounding radius (r) to the width (b) of the 

guide blade (8) being 0.15 to 0.5 in the inlet region of 
the guide apparatus (7); 
b) the setting angle (α
S
) of the guide blade (8) in the 
inlet region of the guide apparatus (7) corresponds to 

the direction of the tangent (11) to the trajectory (12) 
of a fluid particle in the pumped liquid after it has 

left the impeller (5) of the centrifugal pump and before 
it has entered the guide apparatus (7), and 
c) the pressure side (13) of the guide blade (8) is set 
steeper than the suction side (14) to such an extent that 

the guide blade (8) always has an incident flow at part 
load. 
Guide apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the setting angle α
S
≤20°, and the 
angle α
D
 measured on the pressure side of the guide blade 
is ≥50°. 
Submersible motor pump of pipe duct design, 
having a guide apparatus according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the pump housing (6) comprises a 
guide apparatus (7) which is designed as a support member 

and in which the pumped medium flowing radially out of 
the impeller (5) of the centrifugal pump (1) is deflected  

 
in the axial direction.
