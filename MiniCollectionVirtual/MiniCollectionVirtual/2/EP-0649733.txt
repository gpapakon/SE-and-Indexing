<ABSTRACT>
A correcting apparatus for slide bottom dead point position 
of mechanical press which is capable of automatically correcting 

the slide bottom dead point position rapidly and accurately even 
during the operation of the mechanical press with the die-height 

adjusting screw mechanism being fixed. 
The correcting apparatus of the present invention comprises 
a hollow cylindrical member which is disposed between a slide 

and a die-height adjusting screw mechanism and which can be 
reverted or contracted along the axis thereof, a bottom dead 

point position setting means, a bottom dead point position 
detecting means for detecting a slide bottom dead point position 

with respect to the slide, contraction force applying means 
which supply contraction force to the hollow cylindrical member 

so that the hollow cylindrical member can be reverted or 
contracted, and correction control means which control the 

driving of the contraction force applying means to revert or 
contract the hollow cylindrical member in order to correct the 

slide bottom dead point position so that a detected bottom dead 
point position coincides with a set bottom dead point position.

<DESCRIPTION>
Mechanical presses produce heat during their operation. As
a result, the temperatures of respective parts increase and if
the mechanical press is stopped, the temperature thereof drops
to the ambient temperature because of the radiation of heat.
However, the degrees of the rise and drop of the temperatures
thereof differ depending on the respective components
constituting the mechanical press. Thus, differences of the
temperatures are produced among the respective parts so that
differences in the amount of heat expansion occur among the
respective parts because of the differences of the temperatures.
The position of the bottom dead point of the slide is changed
because of the differences in the amount of heat expansion.
Consequently, the die height of the mechanical press is changed.
The change of the die height adversely affects the accuracy of
parts which are produced by the press. The present invention
relates to means for minimizing the change of the die height
or the change of the bottom dead point of the slide in order to
obtain highly accurate parts.The following methods for minimizing the change of the
bottom dead point of the slide have been proposed.
a) A method for splashing oil of a predetermined temperature on 
connecting rods in which the change of the temperature is large
(Japanese Patent Publication No.1-30569) has been proposed.
According to this method, it is difficult to maintain the
position of the bottom dead point of the slide accurately when
the mechanical press is operated with changes in the amount of
generated heat, for example, when the press speed is
changed or when the cycle of operation startup/stop and the
duration time are changed.b) A method has been proposed in which a stopper block is
disposed between the slide and the bed so that they correspond to
each other and in which the stopper block is hit each time when
the bottom dead point is reached in order to restrict the
position of the bottom dead point (Japanese Patent Publication
No.1-55056). According to this method, although the position of
the bottom dead point can be restricted accurately if the
elasticity of the stopper block is high, the changes of load
applied to the mechanical press because of the high elasticity
increase so that the mechanical press may be damaged. If the
elasticity of the stopper block is low, it is not possible to
control the position of the bottom dead point accurately.c) A method for determining the position of the bottom dead
point at a constant position using a die-height adjusting
