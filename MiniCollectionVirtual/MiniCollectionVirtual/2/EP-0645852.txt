<ABSTRACT>
A boardlock for holding a socket (2) to a circuit 
board (8) comprises an integral body including a main 

beam (12), a socket retention section (14) adapted to 
self-retain to the socket, and a circuit board retention 

section (16) engageable in a hole in the circuit board. 
The circuit board retention section is substantially 

flat and, together with at least the main beam, defines 
a plane. The circuit board retention section includes a 

pair of spaced apart legs (22) extending in the plane 
from the main beam to a common remote end defined by a 

tie bar (35). The legs are dimensioned to extend beyond 
an exit of the hole (6) at a far side of the circuit 

board. Portions of the legs (26) are divergently angled 
as they extend to a widest dimension of the circuit 

board retention section. The widest dimension is chosen 
to be wider than a widest dimension of the hole exit in 

the circuit board, and to be spaced from the main beam 
by a distance greater than a thickness of the circuit 

board at a periphery of the hole exit. Further portions 
of the legs (28) are convergently angled as they extend 

from the widest dimension to the remote end (35). The 

structural arrangement of the circuit board retention 
section makes it compliant substantially exclusively in 

the direction of the plane, and the divergently angled 
leg portions are spring biased against the periphery of 

the hole exit through a range of board thickness and 
hole diameter variations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to the field of devices for 
removably securing an electrical connector to a circuit 
board. Single in-line memory module (SIMM) sockets are 
well-known devices for interconnecting printed circuit 
boards (PCB's). The SIMM sockets have an elongated 
channel and a plurality of electrical contacts extending 
into the channel along its length. An edge of one PCB 
(the daughterboard) is insertable into the channel, 
whereby circuit edge pads of the daughterboard are 
engaged by the contacts of the SIMM socket. The 
contacts have leads which extend below a bottom surface 
of the SIMM socket for electrical connection with 
circuit paths on a mating PCB (the motherboard). Such 
electrical connection may be by lead posts which extend 
through plated through-holes in the motherboard, or by 
surface mount leads which engage and are connected to 
contact pads on the motherboard in a soldering 
operation. With either through-hole or surface mount 
leads, alignment of the leads with their respective 
circuit paths on the motherboard is critical. A SIMM socket is typically retained to the 
motherboard by one or more plastic retention posts which 
are integral with and extend from a bottom of the 
socket. These retention posts are dimensioned to 
resiliently engage in holes in the motherboard. Due to 
the inability of circuit board manufacturers to maintain 
close tolerances on circuit board thickness and hole 
diameter, it is difficult to consistently achieve secure 
retention and precise alignment of the SIMM socket on 
the PCB. This is particularly a problem with SIMM 
sockets having surface mount contacts, because the leads 
of these contacts must be in abutting engagement with 
their respective contact pads on the motherboard in 
order that the leads can be soldered to the contact  
 
pads. If the circuit board thickness and hole diameter 
are not held to close tolerances, the SIMM socket may be 
loosely held on the circuit board. A particular problem arises in the case of SIMM 
sockets having through-hole leads which are wave 
soldered to the motherboard. The motherboard is heated 
on the underside away from the socket and, because of 
thermal expansion, the board pulls away from the socket 
creating a gap between the board and the socket. The 
solder freezes while this relative condition exists and, 
when the board cools and returns to thermal equilibrium, 
the board imparts a bow in the socket such that a gap is 
created between a central portion of the socket and the 
board. What is
