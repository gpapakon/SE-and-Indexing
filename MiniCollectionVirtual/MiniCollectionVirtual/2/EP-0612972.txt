<ABSTRACT>
This is designed to avoid the errors in measurement 
arising from the use of gauges or classical feeler gauges 

when these are made of steel, ceramic materials or 
tungsten carbide, given the different expansion 

coefficients of these materials in comparison with those 
of aluminium parts or shapes when substantial ambient 

temperature changes occur in the work area. The system 
consists of the use of gauges, standard feeler gauges or 

any other measuring device manufactured using the same 
type of material as that which is to be measured, that 

is, aluminium or an aluminium alloy, such that this 
offers the same coefficient of expansion. It is also 

planned to subject the said measuring devices, or at 
least their working surfaces or those which make contact 

with others, to a hardening process, such as anodizing or 
hard chroniumplating, for example, to gain perfect 

flatness and avoid wear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a new system of 
measurement, especially designed for use in the 
manufacture of aluminium parts, and therefore especially 
useful in workshops where this material is used and where 
the tolerances permitted are minimum, such as the 
aeronautical, space, missile defense etc. sectors, the 
purpose of the system being to improve the conditions of 
measurement under any ambient temperature conditions. The invention also refers to the standards of 
measurement which are obtained by the said system. The measure or measurement as an operation or set of 
operations by which a quantitative determination of 
physical magnitude is attained through comparison with 
predefined magnitudes used as standards, or by the usage 
of calibrated instruments, aims to achieve results in the 
form of numerical values showing the relation between the 
magnitude under examination and the standard adopted as 
a unit. Within the several types of measurement according to 
how this is carried out, direct or relative measurements 
are taken and compared with values that must be measured 
against a standard (or a copy of the same).  In relation to the type of measurement that has to 
be undertaken, and to the end of the same, different 
types of measurement are used, calibrated instruments 
being of great importance in this field in current 
practice, which even though they are convenient and exact 
for many uses, cannot generally be used for measurements 
requiring great exactitude, for which methods involving 
substitution or opposition are necessary. The method of substitution involves subjecting a 
measuring instrument a value equal to that which is to be 
measured, and the value of which is known beforehand (a 
sample) and then measuring the value under scrutiny such 
that by comparing the effects arising from the 
measurement under scrutiny the value of this last is 
obtained. This method is equivalent to repetition of 
instrument calibration for each measurement to be taken. Respecting the method of measurement by opposition 
or zero, this in general terms consists of introducing an 
object of standard size in the appropriate device 
together with the magnitude under scrutiny, such that 
their affects mutually cancel each other out and the 
scale on the measuring instrument shows zero. This is 
therefore a highly precise method and it is much used in 
laboratories. If in its general description the operation of 
measurement seems to be conceptually uncomplicated, in 
practice great difficulties are

<CLAIMS>
1st.- A system of measurement for aluminium parts, 
based on the use of classic gauges, standard gauges or 

similar measuring instruments, which is essentially 
characterized by consisting of using aluminium or 

aluminium alloys as raw material for the fabrication of 
such measuring instruments, such that in relation to the 

part to be measured desired tolerances are not affected 
in a negative manner by the different coefficient of 

expansion of the standard gauge and the part to be 
measured in reaction to possible changes in the ambient 

temperature of the workplace, it also being planned that 
the working surfaces of the said measuring devices are, 

following their manufacture, to be subjected to hardening 
by any appropriate chemical - physical method to obtain 

the optimum flatness of these surfaces together with a 
high resistance to wear, thereby prolonging their useful 

lives. 
2nd.- Standards to be used in measurement obtained 
by the system described in the 1st claim, essentially 

characterized by the fact that, independently of their 
configuration or size, they are of the same or similar 

nature to the parts to be machined, in this case 
aluminium or an aluminium alloy, with working surfaces, 

or those which make contact with others, that have been 
hardened.
