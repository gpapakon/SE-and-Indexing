<ABSTRACT>
A precursor comprising a metal 2-ethylhexanoate in a xylenes solvent is applied (P7) to an integrated circuit wafer (1, 20, 50). The wafer is baked (P9) to dry the precursor, annealed (P11) to form a layered superlattice material (12, 30, 60) on the wafer, then the integrated circuit (70) is completed. If the metal is titanium, the precursor comprises titanium 2-methoxyethoxide having at least a portion of its 2-methoxyethoxide ligands replaced by 2-ethylhexanoate. If the metal is a highly electropositive element, the solvent comprises 2-methoxyethanol. If the metal is lead, bismuth, thallium, or antinomy, 1 % to 75 % excess metal is included in the precursor to account for evaporation of the oxide during baking and annealing. The process provides ferroelectric devices having extremely low fatigue and high dielectric constant devices that do not degrade easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention in general relates to the fabrication of layered superlattice
materials, and more particularly to fabrication processes that provide low fatigue
ferroelectric and reliable high dielectric constant integrated circuit devices that are
unusually resistant to degradation.In 1959 G.A. Smolenskii, V.A. Isupov, and A.I. Agranovskaya discovered a
new class of ferroelectric materials which they recognized had a layered perovskite
structure. See Chapter 15 of the book, Ferroelectrics and Related Materials, ISSN
0275-9608, (V.3 of the series Ferroelectrics and Related Phenomena, 1984) edited
by G. A. Smolenskii, especially sections 15.3 -15.7. These and other related
materials have recently been recognized as "layered superlattice" materials by the
present inventors. See copending PCT application Serial No. PCT/US92/10627,
which is incorporated herein by reference.Up to now, these layered superlattice materials have not been considered as
being suitable use in integrated circuits or ferroelectric memories, nor have they
been recognized as useful high dielectric constant materials. An attempt has been
made to use two of the layered ferroelectric materials, bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12)
and barium magnesium fluoride in a switching memory application as a gate on a
transistor. See "A New Ferroelectric Memory Device, Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor
Transistor", by Shu-Yau Wu, IEEE Transactions On Electron
Devices, August 1974, pp. 499- 504, which relates to the Bi4Ti3O12 device, and the
article "Integrated Ferroelectrics" by J.F. Scott, C.A. Paz De Araujo, and L.D.
McMillian in Condensed Matter News, Vol. 1, No. 3, 1992, pp. 16- 20, which article
is not prior art to this disclosure; However, Section IIB of the article discusses
experiments with ferroelectric field effect transistors (FEFETs), the exact date of
which experiments is not presently known to the inventors. Both these attempts
failed: In the case of the Bi4Ti3O12 device, the ON state decayed logarithmically after
only two hours, and in the case of the BaMgF4 device, both states decayed
exponentially after a few minutes. See "Memory Retention And Switching Behavior
Of Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor Transistors", by S. Y. Wu, Ferroelectrics, 1976
Vol. 11, pp. 379 -383. It is believed that a key reason why none of the layered superlattice materials
have been successfully used in a ferroelectric, high dielectric constant, or other
practical application is that the processes of preparing the materials and fabricating
devices from the materials
