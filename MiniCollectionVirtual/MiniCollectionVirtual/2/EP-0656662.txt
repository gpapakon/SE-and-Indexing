<ABSTRACT>
A bidirectional current blocking lateral MOSFET 
including a source and a drain which are not shorted to a 

substrate, and voltages that are applied to the source and 
drain are both higher than the voltage at which the body 

is maintained (for an N-channel MOSFET) or lower than the 
voltage at which the body is maintained (for a P-channel 

MOSFET). The on-resistance of the MOSFET is improved by 
decreasing the conductance of the epi region and disposing 

a thin threshold adjust layer on the surface of the 

substrate between the oxide layer and a channel of the 
body region separating the source and drain regions. An 

optional second punchthrough preventing implant is 
disposed on the substrate surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to and incorporates by
reference the subject matter of European Application No. 94 309 140.5
together with the subject matter of US application nos.
08/159,900 and 08/219,586 from which that European
Application claims priority and copies of which are filed
herewith, and is also related to and incorporates by
reference the subject matter of European Application no. 94 308 841.9
together with the subject matter of US application no.
08/160,560 from which that European Application claims
priority and of which a copy is filed herewith. Both of
these related European applications are filed on the same day
as this application.This invention relates to a bidirectional current
blocking MOSFET and in particular to a bidirectional current
blocking MOSFET with improved on-resistance and a method for
improving the on-resistance of a bidirectional current
blocking MOSFET.Users of battery-powered devices such as notebook
computers require that the devices be usable for long periods
of time between battery recharges. This requirement has led
to cascaded battery arrangements, in which a primary battery,
a secondary battery, etc., are connected to the device in
succession. Frequently an AC/DC converter is also provided
to allow the user to 
conserve battery power when the user is near a source of AC
power. A connection for an external backup battery may also
be provided.A known arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 1 wherein a
primary battery B1 and a secondary battery B2 are connected
via switches S1 and S2, respectively, to a load L, which
could be a DC/DC converter supplying, for example, a notebook
computer. The supply connections are made through a bus
which is designated B, which is maintained at a voltage Vbus.Also connected to bus B is an AC/DC converter C3 which
supplies power through a switch S3. The voltage supplied by
primary battery B1 is designated V1, the voltage supplied by
secondary battery B2 is designated V2, and the voltage
supplied by AC/DC converter C3 is designated V3. A backup
battery B4 is also connected to bus B.In the operation of this multiple battery arrangement,
only one of switches S1, S2 and S3 would normally be closed.
The remaining switches would be open. When power is supplied
to the bus B by primary battery B1, for example, switch S1 is
closed and switches S2 and S3 are open.As the power sources are switched in and out, the
voltage across switches S1, S2, and S3 can vary both in
magnitude and direction. This is illustrated in Figs. 2A-2C.
As shown in Fig. 2A,

<CLAIMS>
A method of using a power MOSFET to switch a power
supply current in a conduction path between a power

source and a load, wherein a variable voltage imposed on
said conduction path causes the current to flow

bidirectionally in either a first direction or a second
direction at different times, the MOSFET comprising:


a semiconductor substrate (711) of a first
conductivity type having a first doping

concentration level;
an epitaxial layer (712) of the first
conductivity type formed on said semiconductor

substrate, said epitaxial layer having a second
doping concentration level less than said first

doping concentration level; and

   a plurality of cells, each cell comprising:

first and second regions (722, 732) of a second
conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity

type formed in said epitaxial layer, said first and
second regions being separated by a channel region

(713), neither of said first and second regions
being shorted to said epitaxial layer;
a threshold implant layer (740) of the first
conductivity type formed at a surface of said

epitaxial layer, said threshold implant layer having 
a third doping concentration greater than said

second doping concentration;
a gate oxide layer (750) over said epitaxial
layer; and
a gate (760) over said gate oxide layer;

the method comprising:

connecting said substrate to ground potential;
connecting said first and second regions in each of
said cells into said conduction path;
establishing a voltage of said gate at a level above
said threshold voltage so as to allow said current to

flow in said conductive path in either of said first and
second directions; and
establishing a voltage of said gate at a level below
said threshold voltage so as to block said current from

flowing in said conductive path in either of said first
and second directions.
The method of claim 1 wherein the threshold implant
layer has a thickness of about 0.5 µm and a doping

concentration of the first conductivity type of
approximately 10

The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said power MOSFET
further comprises a punchthrough implant layer of the 

first conductivity type, said punchthrough implant layer
having a doping concentration at a fourth concentration

level less than said third concentration level but
greater than said second concentration level, said

punchthrough implant layer extending into said epitaxial
layer to a depth greater than said threshold implant

layer.
The method of any one of claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein
said gate oxide layer has a thickness which is

substantially a minimum thickness needed to support said
gate drive voltage.
