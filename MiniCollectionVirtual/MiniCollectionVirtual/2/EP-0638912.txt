<ABSTRACT>
The primary winding and part of the magnetic circuit 
of an automobile battery charging transformer are mounted in 

a separable inductive charge coupler (16) which is insertable 
into and removable from an inductive charge receptacle slot 

in the automobile adjacent the transformer secondary winding 
and magnetic structure. When the inductive charge coupler (16) 

is in place and is energized, the primary winding energizes 
the secondary winding to permit charging of the batteries on 

the automobile. The inductive charge coupler (16) is cooled 
by a fluid passage (26 - 32) therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical transformer 
comprising 
a transformer secondary inductive charge receptacle 
including secondary electrical windings and magnetically 
conductive material forming a portion of a magnetic circuit, 
and an inductive charge coupler for 
insertion into a slot in said transformer 
secondary inductive charge receptable, 
said inductive charge coupler having magnetic material thereon 
for completing the magnetic circuit when said inductive charge 
coupler is inserted into said secondary inductive charge 
receptacle slot, said inductive charge coupler having a primary 
electrical winding thereon so that when said inductive charge 
coupler is in its secondary inductive charge receptacle slot, 
energization of said primary winding causes energization of 
said secondary structure, said inductive charge coupler being 
removable from said slot in said secondary winding, said 
inductive charge coupler and said secondary structure being 
separable. The present invention relates further to an automotive 
vehicle having a slot therein and having electric transformer 
secondary structure adjacent said slot, including a secondary 
electrical winding and a magnetic core forming a portion of 
a magnetic circuit, an inductive charge coupler for insertion 
into said slot, said inductive charge coupler having a primary 
electrical winding therein and a primary magnetic core for

coupler is in said slot, said inductive charge coupler being 
connected to a fixed power source for energization of said 
primary coil so that electric power is transferred to automobile. Such an electrical transformer and such an automotive 
vehicle are known from EP-A-0 552 737.  
 In charging the batteries of automobiles, a 
transformer primary inductive charge coupler is inserted 
into the transformer secondary inductive charge receptacle 
on the automobile, which then charges the batteries 
of the automobile. The primary inductive charge 
coupler is cooled to cool the transformer for increased 
performance and so that the transformer coupler is not 
too hot when removed. In order to reduce air pollution, there is a 
modern trend toward electrically powered automobiles. 
These electrically powered automobiles have rechargeable 
batteries therein. The power of the batteries is used 
to propel the automobile and to provide for other power 
needs thereof. The design of such a vehicle is a 
careful balance between payload, performance, range
