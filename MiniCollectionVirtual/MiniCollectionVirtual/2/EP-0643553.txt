<ABSTRACT>
Device for removal of sediment particles from the water in a cultivating tank (1), where a cylindrical outlet (3), connected to an outlet tube (22) is located on the vertical axis of symmetry of the tank (1). Means (19), e.g. a plate (19), forming a slot (15) is located against the upper edge of an annular chamber (8). The annular chamber (8) is located around the outlet (3), and has an outlet tube (12) for particle-enriched water. For use in a cultivating tank having a flat bottom, the chamber (7) may have a slant section (24) from the bottom (6) of the tank, diverging inwardly against the annular chamber (8). The device may also be used for separate monitoring of a zonal divided tank (1). The concentrated particle flow in the outlet tube (12) is individually monitored in a monitoring unit (28), connected to means for controlling feeding, water provision and oxygen provision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for removal of sediment particles from the water in a basin or tank for cultivating
aquatic organisms, according to the introductory part of claim 1.Previously known cultivating plants have a small degree of separation of sediment particles from the water outlet.
Presently, a lot of work is being done on a number of different solutions for screening or filtering particles from the outlet
water. This is expensive due to the great volume of outlet water.Most existing cultivating plants are incorrectly dimensioned if self-purification of the tank and outlet system is to be
acheived. Purification of tanks and transport of particles in the outlet system is dependent on manual brushing and
abrupt draining of the tanks. This means that the plants for separation of particles are being subjected to maximal
hydraulic load and particle load at the same time, and consequently the plants should be dimensioned for this shock
treatment.In this kind of cultivation tank, the body of water rotates through the vertical axis of symmetry in the center of the
tank. The flow conditions are established by use of the inlet and outlet arrangement for water supply and draining of the
tank.The water supply is located in the tank wall and the inlet comprises at least one underwater jet having a flow direction
adapted to the desired flow pattern in the tankThe outlet from the tank is located centrally in the bottom of the basin on the vertical axis of symmetry of the tank.
The outlet arrangement may be of different geometrical shapes; plane drainage or tower drainage with outlet in the top
and/or distributed along the tower. The outlet arrangement should be dimensioned so that there will be established a
combinition of a forced and free vortex (Rankine's combined vortex). The outlet vortex represents a substantial contribution
to the flow pattern that is desired in the tank and simultanously is an important factor in the flow patterns internally
in the particle trap according to present invention.The flow conditions that are established in the tank can be separated in a primary and secondary system. The primary
flow rotates the body of water about the vertical axis of symmetry and is established using the inlet and outlet
arrangement. The secondary flow has an angular direction of 90 Â° relatively to the primary flow, and is approximately
1/5 - 1/10 of the primary flow. The secondary flow comes into existence due to friction in the boundaries between the
body of water and the bottom and the
