<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers comprising from 5 to 50 % by weight of one or more glycidyl esters of saturated aliphatic C4-C30-monocarboxylic acids containing a tertiary or quaternary  alpha -carbon atom and from 95 to 5 % by weight of at least two olefinically unsaturated, copolymerisable monomers, of which at least one contains at least one carboxyl group. The copolymers are characterised by an OH number of from 50 to 250 mg of KOH/g, a solution viscosity of from 15 to 2000 mPa s (50 % strength solution at 23 DEG C), a mean molecular weight (weight average Mw) of less than 8600 g/mol and a nonuniformity of less than 3.4. The copolymers according to the invention are particularly suitable as binder components for high-solids coating compositions.
