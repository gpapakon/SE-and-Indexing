<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a welded pipe with high dimensional accuracy on a production line for the welded pipe, wherein a 
metal web having a predetermined width is continuously roll-formed and welded, and more particularly for bending the end portions 

of the metal web with high accuracy, and a forming stand therefor. A pair of top and bottom forming horizontal rolls or a 
forming horizontal roll, each split into two segments in the metal web width direction, can be each adjusted in position in the 

widthwise direction, and further, each split top roll segment has a construction capable of turning about and being fixed on a 
shaft disposed in the vertical direction. Further, in order to maximize the effect of the present invention, the direction of turning 

and the angle of turning are restricted. With the above-described arrangement, edge bending can be performed without impairing 
the accuracy in the wall thickness of the material to be formed, and further, common use of rolls for forming metal webs into 

pipes with different diameters is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a forming method
and forming stand according to the preambles of claims 1 and 8 respectively,
for forming welded pipes to accurate
dimensions in a welded pipe manufacturing line on which a
metallic strip of a predetermined width is continuously
formed by rolls and welded by the electric resistance
welding method or other welding methods.In general, in a manufacturing process in which
welded pipes such as electric resistance welded pipes are
manufactured, a metallic strip of a predetermined width is
continuously supplied to a group of forming rolls including
a plurality of breakdown rolls, side rolls and fin-pass
rolls, and then the formed metallic strip is subjected to
welding such as high frequency welding in which squeeze
rolls are used.According to this method, welded pipes are
continuously manufactured. Therefore, this method is
greatly advantageous in that the manufacturing efficiency is
improved and the cost is reduced. Accordingly, this method
is widely used when mechanical structure pipes, boiler
pipes, oil well pipes and other various pipes are
manufactured. Recently, there is a demand for applying this
method to the manufacture of thin wall pipes, thick wall
pipes and high tensile strength pipes. Further, there is a
strong demand for manufacturing pipes of high quality and
high accuracy.However, when these thin wall pipes, thick wall
pipes and high tensile strength pipes are formed by the
conventional pipe manufacturing method, the profiles of
these pipes are defective. In
the initial process of edge forming in which a pair of 
breakdown rolls composed of upper and lower rolls are used,
the edge portions of a work piece are insufficiently bent.In order to solve the above problem, a "W-bend
method", in which the middle portion of a work piece is bent
at a curvature opposite to that of
the edge forming process,
has
come into pfactical use. The effect of this method is
introduced, for example, on page 519 of the proceedings of a
plastic working lecture meeting (held in spring of 1985)
published by the Plastic Working Society.According to the method disclosed in Japanese
unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-44217, two rolls
are used for the horizontal lower caliber roll
applied to the edge forming roll stand, and the inclination
angles of the two rolls are capable of being adjusted with
respect to the metallic strip advancing direction, so that
the edge portions of both thick and thin wall metallic
strips are sufficiently bent.In the process for
