<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic piano (1), an electronic sound producing 
system (3) and a controlling system (2) form a keyboard 

instrument for selectively producing acoustic sounds and 
electronically synthesized sounds, and the controlling 

system has a catcher stopper (2c) for restricting rotations 
of catchers before hammer heads strike sets of strings in 

the electronic sound producing mode, thereby giving the 
unique piano key-touch to a player without mixing noise 

with the synthesized sounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keyboard instrument and,
more particularly, to a keyboard instrument selectively
entering into an acoustic sound mode and a silence mode.A piano given a unique touch to a player, and an
electronic keyboard synthesizer does not exactly imitates
the unique key-touch, and an attempt was made on a
compromise between a piano and an electronic synthesizer.The compromise or the piano-like musical instrument
has key action mechanisms coupled between the keyboard and
the hammer assemblies and a tone generator system, and
sounds are synthesized by the tone generator system.
However, the key action mechanisms drives the hammer
assemblies for striking the strings, and gives the unique
key-touch to the player.However, when a hammer strikes the strings, the
strings vibrate, and produce an acoustic sound. The
acoustic sound is mixed with the synthesized sound, and an
audience feels the mixed sounds strange.One of the piano-like keyboard instruments is 
disclosed in Japanese Publication of Examined Patent
Application (Kokoku) No. 1-30155, and teaches how to
decrease the loudness of the acoustic sounds. According to
the Japanese Publication of Examined Application, a damper
mechanism originally incorporated in the piano is brought
into contact with the strings, and the damper mechanism
restricts the vibrations on the struck strings.Another muting mechanism incorporated in a grand
piano is disclosed in Japanese Publication of Unexamined
Utility Model Application (Kokai) No. 51-67732, and the
muting mechanism restricts a hammer motion by means of a
resilient member. According to the Japanese Publication of
Unexamined Utility Model Application, the hammer
concurrently strikes the resilient member and the
associated strings, and the impact is split between the
resilient member and the strings. As a result, the
strings weakly vibrate, and the sound is lessened.The prior art piano-like keyboard instruments can
decrease the loudness of acoustic sounds. However, the
prior art piano-like keyboard instruments can not perfectly
eliminate the acoustic sounds from electrically synthesized
sounds.If the resilient member is moved to a closer position 
to the home position of the hammer, the hammer strikes the
resilient member only, and the acoustic sound is not
produced. However, the resilient member closer to the home
position does not allow the jack to escape from the butt,
and the key action mechanism can not give the unique key
touch to the player.If the hammer is removed, the strings never vibrate,
and
