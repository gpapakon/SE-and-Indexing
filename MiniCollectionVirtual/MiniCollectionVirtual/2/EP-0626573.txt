<ABSTRACT>
A thermocouple vacuum gauge includes a first 
thermocouple element (14) spaced below a second 

thermocouple element (16). The two thermocouple 
elements are electrically connected in series in a 

back-to-back manner by connecting together their 
respective negative ends. A pulse generator (50) 

supplies a pulsing on-off current only to the first 
thermocouple element (14). During the off intervals, a 

switch (44) connects the positive ends of both 
thermocouple elements to a voltage measuring and 

comparing circuit (42) which measures a thermally 
generated voltage signal between the positive ends of 

the thermocouple elements and compares the measured 
voltage signal to a reference signal. The result of 

the comparison is used to vary the output current of 
the pulse generator so as to supply an amount of 

current to the first thermocouple element sufficient to 
cause the measured voltage signal to approach the 

reference signal. The amount of current supplied 
sufficient to cause the measured voltage signal to 

approach the reference signal is proportional to the 
amount of pressure or vacuum in an enclosure in which 

the thermocouples of the vacuum gauge are placed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermocouple apparatus to measure
pressures under partial vacuum and more particularly to an apparatus
sensitive to pressures over a wider range. The invention is described in the
context of a thermocouple vacuum gauge.Thermocouple vacuum gauges are known in the art. Typically,
such gauges employ one or more thermocouples in a circuit configuration.A thermocouple is, itself, an electric circuit consisting of a pair
of wires of dissimilar metals joined together at one end (the sensing or
measuring junction, also called the hot junction) and terminated at their other
end in such a manner that the terminals (reference junction or cold junction)
are both at the same and known temperature (reference temperature). Leads
are connected from the reference junction to some sort of load resistance
(e.g., an indicating meter or the input impedance of other readout or signal-conditioning
equipment) to complete the thermocouple circuit. Both these
connecting leads can be of copper or some other metals dissimilar from the
metals joined at the sensing junction.Due to the thermoelectric effect (Seebeck effect), a current is
caused to flow through the circuit whenever the sensing junction and the 
reference junction are at different temperatures. The electromotive force
(thermoelectric EMF) which causes current to flow through the circuit is
dependent in its magnitude on the sensing junction wire materials, as well as
on the temperature difference between the two junctions.Thermocouple vacuum gauges are widely used as vacuum
measuring devices in the pressure range of 0.133 to 133 Pa (10-3 to 1 torr). The term "vacuum"
which strictly speaking implies the unrealizable ideal of space entirely devoid
of matter, is used in a relative sense to denote gas pressure below the normal
atmospheric pressure of about 105 Pa (760 torr). The degree or quality of the vacuum
attained is indicated by the total pressure of the residual gases in the vessel
which is pumped. By standard conventional terminology, a coarse or rough
vacuum has a pressure range from about 105 to 133 Pa (760 to 1 torr), a medium vacuum has a
pressure range from 133 to 0.133 Pa (1 to 10-3 torr), a high vacuum has a pressure range from
0.133 to 1.33 x 10-5 Pa (10-3 to 10-7 torr), a very high vacuum has a pressure range from 1.33 x 10-5 to 1.33 x 10-7 Pa (10-7 to 10-9
torr), and an ultrahigh vacuum has pressures smaller than 1.33 x 10-7 Pa (10-9 torr).In a typical thermocouple vacuum gauge, a thermocouple is
heated either directly (e.g., by
