<ABSTRACT>
A brake system for a motor vehicle is described in which a front/rear brake pressure distribution is undertaken as a function of the load. The brake pressure distribution is further optimised in that in addition the gradient of the brake pressure build-up, preferably on the rear axle, is also varied, so that the rear wheel brake pressure rises more slowly when the vehicle is less heavily laden.

<CLAIMS>
Method of operating a brake system for a motor
vehicle, in which a brake signal generated by the

driver is converted into different required brake
pressure control signals for the wheels of the wheel

axles, these required brake pressure control signals
being load-dependent, and in which the corresponding

brake pressures at the brakes are fed in by means of
these required brake pressure control signals,

characterized in that additionally the time gradient of
the rise in pressure (Δp/Δt) can be influenced for the

rear axle and is altered as a function of the load, the
rear axle brake pressure rising more slowly in the case

of a smaller load than in the case of a larger load.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the change in gradient takes place by changing the

pulse width and/or frequency of an activation pulse
sequence for a feed valve.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the change in gradient takes place by changing the

flow cross-section.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the change in gradient takes place by means of a

force-controlled metering device.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the change in the gradients takes

place as a function of one or more wheel or axle loads.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the change in gradient takes 

place as a function of dynamic vehicle and/or brake
data.
