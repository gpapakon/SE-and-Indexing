<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of
protective antigens by recombinant DNA technology for
use as anthelmintic agents and as protective immunogens
in the control of diseases caused by helminth parasites.Helminth parasites are responsible for a wide range
of diseases and infestations of domestic animals which,
leading as they do to loss of production and even animal
mortality, are of considerable economic importance.
Thus for example, the blood feeding nematode Haemonchus
infects the lining of the gastrointestinal tract of
ruminants, causing anaemia and weight loss and if
untreated frequently leads to death. Animals infected
with the related non-blood feeding nematode Ostertagia
similarly fail to thrive and may die if untreated.
Other genera of helminths of economic importance include
Trichostrongylus and Nematodirus which cause enteritis
in various animals, and trematodes.Problems are also caused by nematodes such as
hookworms (eg. Necator, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria and
Bunostomum spp) and flukes (eg. Fasciola, Paramphistomum
and Dicrocoelium) and their relatives which in addition
to ruminants and domestic pets, also infect humans,
frequently with fatal results.Control of helminth parasites presently relies
primarily on the use of anthelmintic drugs combined with
pasture management. Such techniques have a number of
drawbacks however - frequent administration of drugs and
pasture management are often not practical, and drug-resistant
helminth strains are becoming increasingly
widespread. There is therefore a need in this field for an
effective anti-helminth vaccine and many efforts have
been concentrated in this area in recent years.
However, as yet there are no commercially available
molecular or sub-unit vaccines for the major helminth
species, particularly for the gastrointestinal nematodes
of ruminants, such as Haemonchus and Ostertagia.Most promising results to date have been obtained
with novel proteins isolated from Haemonchus, which have
potential as protective antigens not only against
Haemonchus but also against a range of other helminths.
In particular the protein doublet H11OD, found at the
luminal surface of the intestine of H.contortus has been
shown to confer protective immunity against haemonchosis
in sheep.H11OD from H.contortus has an approximate molecular
weight of 110 kilodaltons (kd) under reducing and non-reducing
conditions, as defined by SDS-PAGE, and is
described in W088/00835 and W090/11086. The term
"H11OD" as used herein refers to the protein doublet
H110D as
