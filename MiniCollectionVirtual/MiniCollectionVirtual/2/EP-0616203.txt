<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder pressure sensor of the type 
measuring flexure of a first wall relative to a second 

wall along a response axis and used in an internal 
combustion engine is characterised by linear response 

over a relatively wide range of preload forces. 
Various sensor engagements provide for minimal 

transmutation of forces along the response axis to any 
other direction, thereby improving linearity of 

response, durability and serviceability of the 
pressure sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder 
pressure sensor for an internal combustion engine. It is known in the field relating to 
internal combustion engines to utilise cylinder 
pressure sensors for monitoring and controlling 
various processes, among them being combustion knock, 
misfire and associated combustion dilution and 
combustion phasing. This invention relates to cylinder pressure 
sensors and more particularly to non-intrusive 
pressure sensors having no direct contact with the 
harsh environment of a cylinder. Non-intrusive 
pressure sensors measuring combustion pressure remote 
from direct contact with combustion are known which 
take various applications. Some applications include 
trapped force ring arrangements such as a 
piezoelectric annulus between cylinder head bolts and 
an engine block or alternatively between a spark plug 
seat and spark plug. Other non-intrusive pressure 
sensors include probe type and annular insert type 
which respond to flexure of a first wall defining in 
part a cylinder relative to a second rigid wall in an 
engine head. The latter mentioned types of 
non-intrusive pressure sensors, embodiments of which 
are set out in US Patent Nos. 4,601,196 and 4,969,352, 
improve upon signal quality shortfalls of the former 
mentioned types and are preferred among alternatives. Some advantages of the preferred probe type 
and annular insert type pressure sensors over other 
non-intrusive pressure sensors include reduced dynamic 
phase lag, relative insensitivity to extraneous loads, 
lower operating temperature and other advantages due 
to their placement in proximity to the cylinder. While the preferred non-intrusive pressure 
sensors present substantial improvements to the field  
 
of cylinder pressure sensing, further improvements can 
be made. For example, a certain degree of non-linear 
response and gain variation from pressure sensor to 
pressure sensor are present with the preferred related 
art pressure sensors. These undesirable 
characteristics tend to be exacerbated when the sensor 
structural material has a modulus of elasticity and 
yield strength of limited magnitude -- such as is 
characteristic of aluminium and alloys thereof. This 
presents practical problems since modern combustion 
engines commonly have cylinder heads of aluminium 
alloys and, for reasons of matching thermal expansion 
characteristics of the pressure sensor thereto, the 
sensor structural material is preferably similar. Further, preferred non-intrusive pressure 
sensors may tend
