<ABSTRACT>
A supporting device for a wire comb comprises a support surface (18) and a plurality of support members (22) extending from said support surface (18) in spaced array, over each of which support members a looped portion of the comb, between adjacent fingers thereof, may be engaged to enable the comb to be supported from the supporting device in a cantilever manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to comb 
binders as are used for binding together a stack of sheets of (e.g.) paper provided 
adjacent to one side edge with a series of uniformly-spaced binding apertures. The conventional comb for a binder comprises a plurality of fingers 
connected together and arranged in spaced longitudinal array, the fingers each 
extending generally in a plane extending at right angles to a longitudinal axis, and 
adopting or being capable of adopting a somewhat arcuate disposition whereby, 
when the fingers are located through the binding apertures of a stack of sheets, 
the fingers enclose or may enclose the side edge of the stack allowing the sheets 
of paper of the stack to be opened as a book. One conventional comb binder is of plastics material, and comprises 
a spine from which the fingers extend, the fingers at rest adopting a coiled 
configuration and being straightened to allow insertion of the fingers into the 
binding apertures of the stack of sheets in a binding operation, and upon release 
coiling around the edge of the stack. Another conventional comb binder is manufactured from a material 
such as wire, and comprises a basal line from which the fingers extend generally 
in the form of hooks, being initially in a configuration in which there is an 
opening between each finger and the basal line whereby the fingers may be 
inserted through the binding apertures, the fingers being capable of being non-resiliently 
deformed to close the opening and to encircle the edge of the stack of 
sheets through the apertures to allow the sheets of paper to be opened as a book. 
One such comb binder is described in GB-B-1460444. While plastic combs of the kind described in the last preceding 
paragraph but one are more generally used, the non-resiliently deformable combs 
described in the last preceding paragraph have the advantage that they are 
capable of providing the bound stack with a great degree of opening capability for  
 
the sheets which are bound, particularly allowing an opening which approaches 
360째, as compared with the plastics comb, in which the opening is restricted to 
about 310째, and the present invention is concerned particularly with such combs, 
particularly where the hook portions are provided by parallel portions of wire 
joined together by a bridge at the front end of the book. For convenience of reference such non-resiliently deformable combs 
will hereinafter be referred to as wire combs, wire being the most commonly used 
material

<CLAIMS>
A supporting device for a wire comb comprising a support surface (18) 
and a plurality of support members (22) extending from said support surface (18) 

in spaced array, over each of which support members a looped portion of the 
comb, between adjacent fingers thereof, may be engaged to enable the comb to 

be supported from the supporting device in a cantilever manner. 
A device according to Claim 1 wherein the support surface 18 is 
inclined at an angle between 15째 and 70째 to the vertical. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 and 2 wherein each supporting 
member (22) comprises an upper portion (26) which is spaced a short distance 

from the supporting surface (18). 
A device according to Claim 3 wherein a seating surface (24,28) is 
provided on which the base portion of the comb may be seated. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
upper portions (26) are uniformly spaced. 
A device according to Claim 5 wherein the spacing of the upper 
portion is on centres of 16.9mm. 
A device according to Claim 5 wherein the spacing of the upper 
portions (26) is based on 33.8mm centres. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims forming part of 
a machine by which the comb may be deformed to clamp a stack of sheets in 

bound configuration.  
 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims comprising a 
plurality of spaced, upwardly-open slots (29) into each of which a looped portion 

of the comb may be engaged, engagement of the looped portion (a) with a wall 
of the slot and (b) with the support surface providing said cantilever support for 

the comb.
