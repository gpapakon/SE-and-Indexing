<ABSTRACT>
A method of co-hydrolyzing silanes of the formulas 
HSi(OR)₃ and Si(OR)₄ to form a soluble resinous 

co-hydrolysate is disclosed. The method comprises 
hydrolyzing the silanes with water in an acidified oxygen 

containing polar organic solvent. The invention also relates 
to the soluble co-hydrolysates formed thereby as well as the 

method of using the co-hydrolysates to provide coatings on 
various substrates, including electronic devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
co-hydrolyzing silanes of the formulas HSi(OR)3 and Si(OR)4 
to form soluble resinous co-hydrolysates. Additionally, the 
invention relates to soluble co-hydrolysates formed thereby 
and a method of using said co-hydrolysates to provide 
coatings on various substrates, including electronic devices. It is known in the prior art that organotrialkoxysilanes 
dissolved in a solvent are readily hydrolyzed by 
water in an acidic environment. See, Eaborn, "Organosilicon 
Compounds", Butterworth's Scientific Publications, London 
(1960), p 301. The resultant hydrolysates, however, can be 
unstable and often condense upon formation to yield insoluble 
organopolysiloxane gels. Similar hydrolysis and condensation reactions are 
known to occur in hydridosilanes (silanes with an Si-H bond) 
with organoxy functional groups. The Si-H bonds of these 
silanes, however, are susceptible to cleavage resulting in 
the production of insoluble gels. For instance, Muller in 
Chem Tech 2 (1950), p 7-13 & 41-49, discloses that the 
hydrolysis of triethoxysilane to silanetriol in an alcohol 
results in the production of an insoluble gel. Levene, U.S. Patent No. 3,811,918, teaches the 
formation of a gel resistant glass precursor composition 
which may be heated to form a protective glass coating. The 
coating composition is formed by a partially hydrolyzing a 
silicon alkoxide in a solvent, reacting the partial 
hydrolysate with an aqueous solution of a metal oxide forming 
compound, hydrolyzing this solution with additional water and 
then adding an acid to form a stable, gel-free solution.  
 Hayes, U.S. Patent No. 4,395,563, describes a 
method of hydrolyzing an alkoxysilane by mixing the alkoxysilane 
with a stoichiometric excess of water and an acid 
catalyst. The resultant hydrolysis mixture is then 
neutralized and the hydrolysis products separated. Both 
Levene and Hayes do not teach, suggest nor infer the co-hydrolysis 
of silanes. EP 443 760 discloses a method of hydrolysing 
hydridosilane to form a hydrolysate comprising forming a 
mixture comprising a hydridosilane of the formula HSi(OR)3 
wherein each R is independently an organic group which when 
bonded to silicon through an oxygen atom forms a hydrolysable 
substituent, an oxygen-containing polar organic solvent, 
water and an acid and facilitating hydrolysis for a time 
sufficient to hydrolyse or partially hydrolyse said 
hydridosilane. We have unexpectedly found that the process of the 
present invention provides a method
