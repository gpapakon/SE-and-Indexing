<ABSTRACT>
The electrophoretic separator (10) comprises: an array of subcompartments (12) with two electrode compartments (30, 32) on either side of the array, each subcompartment has an inlet port (11) and a collection port (13); a buffer reservoir; a throughput pump (68) for supplying buffer from the buffer reservoir to each inlet port; a sample pump for supplying sample to the inlet port(s) of one or more subcompartments; a fraction pump (70) for withdrawing an even fractional portion of the fluid flow pumped out of each of the collection ports; and a centering withdrawal pump (80) for withdrawing an additional portion of the fluid flow out of one of exit ports adjacent to one of the electrode compartments. The fraction pump and centering withdrawal pump create a counterflow gradient in the subcompartments.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICAL SEPARATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD OF COUNTERFLOW GRADIENT FOCUSINGBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to an apparatus for conducting separation of biological materials, such as peptides, proteins, cells, cell organelles, cell membranes, viruses, and organic and inorganic compounds or all metal ions from a mixture. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for batch or continuous- flow electrophoretic separation of ionic molecules by zone electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, counterflow gradient focusing or by electrodialysis.Electrophoresis is an analytical and preparative tool which can separate components of a mixture on the basis of their ionic charge and mass. A mixture of ionic species is exposed to an applied voltage field, which causes the ions to migrate toward the oppositely charged electrode at a rate which depends on their electrophoretic mobility, which in turn depends on charge, mass and symmetry as well as other parameters. Different modalities of electrophoresis, e.g., zone, isoelectric focusing, isotachophoresis, moving boundary can be utilized in various instruments that are classified by the method selected to minimize convective mixing: 1) free fluid methods which use thin film, shear, capillaries, or compartmentation; or 2) supported fluid methods which use density gradient gels or other matrices. The present method is free fluid compartmentation.Zone electrophoresis is the separation carried out in the presence of a homogenous buffer, in which sample components separate according to their mobility. No steady state is achieved, and migration continues with gradual broadening of the sample zones due to diffusion and other effects.Isoelectric focusing (IEF) is a variant based upon the fact that most biomaterials are amphoteric in nature, i.e., are positively charges in an acidic environment and negatively charged in a basic environment. At a particular pH value, called the isoelectric point (pi) , the biomaterials acquire a 

zero net charge due to the balance of positive and negative charges. When such amphoteric materials are exposed to an applied electrical field, in a medium exhibiting a pH gradient, they will migrate toward the pH region of their pi and become immobilized or focused in a steady state at that pH region.Electrophoretic separation in multi-compartment electrolyzers has been known since 1912 (Ikeda et al, U.S. Patent No. 1,015,891) when it was introduced for preparative scale protein fractionation.
