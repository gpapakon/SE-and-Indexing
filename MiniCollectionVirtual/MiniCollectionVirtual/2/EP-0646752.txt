<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a control system for a heating appliance heated with fuel, especially a water heater, having a mixing device for the fuel/air mixture fed to the burner and a controller which is provided in the exhaust gas duct with a measurement sensor which influences the fuel/air ratio (the air ratio) with the effect of minimising exhaust gas losses. It is proposed that the measurement sensor (14, 16) should be constructed to respond to CO or NOx in the exhaust gas and should detect the volume contents of these exhaust components, and that the controller (18) should be designed so as to control the fuel/air ratio (the air ratio) with the effect of observing, or dropping below to the smallest possible extent, the admissible limit values of CO or NOx. As a result a safety margin with respect to at least one of the exhaust gas components CO or NOx is dispensed with and as a result the loss of exhaust gas or the emission of noxious substances from the combustion is kept as small as possible.
