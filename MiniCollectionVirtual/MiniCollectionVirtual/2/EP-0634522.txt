<ABSTRACT>
A disc for defibering or refining paper pulp according to the invention includes a grinding surface which has a large number of ribs (9-12) separated by grooves (13-15). The disc body (8) consists of a first material such as stainless steel or cast iron, ensuring the general mechanical robustness of the disc in use. The upper part of the ribs (9-12) consists of a layer (16-19) of an abrasion-resistant material based on tungsten carbide particles bonded in a metal alloy whose melting and weldability characteristics are appropriate for refurbishing with a laser on the disc body (8). The ribs (9-12) are successively refurbished by scanning with a laser beam and a nozzle for spraying powder, in one or a number of runs.

Paper pulp defibering or refining plate comprising a plate 
body (8) having a comminuting surface having a large number of ridges (1, 

5, 9-12) separated by grooves (13-15), wherein : 

the plate body (8) is made of a first material adapted to provide the 
general mechanical strength of the plate in use, 
the upper part of the ridges (9-12) is a layer (16-19) of composite 
material comprising hard abrasion resistant material grains, 
 
characterized in that: 


the layer (16-19) of composite material forming the upper part of the 
ridges (9-12) is based on hard abrasion resistant material powder bound in 

a brazing metal alloy whose melting and brazing characteristics are 
appropriate to laser resurfacing of the first material forming the plate 

body (8). 
Defibering or refining plate according to claim 1 
characterized in that the plate body (8), the lower part (20-23) of the 

ridges (9-12) and the bottom of the grooves (24-26) are made of cast iron. 
Defibering or refining plate according to claim 1 
characterized in that the plate body (8), the lower part of the ridges 

(20-23) and the bottom of the grooves (24-26) are made of stainless steel. 
Defibering or refining plate according to any one of claims 
1 to 3 characterized in that the composite material forming the upper 

layer (16-19) of the ridges (9-12) comprises grains of tungsten carbide 
bound in a brazing metal alloy based on nickel, chromium, silicon, iron 

and boron. 
Defibering or refining plate according to claim 4 
characterized in that the percentage by weight of tungsten carbide 

contained in the composite material is between 50% and 70%. 
Defibering or refining plate according to claim 4 or claim 5 
characterized in that the tungsten carbide is in the form of substantially 

spherical grains of tungsten carbide. 
Method of manufacturing a paper pulp defibering or refining 
plate, the plate comprising a plate body (8) in a first material adapted 

to provide the general mechanical strength of the plate in use, the plate 
body comprising a comminuting surface having a large number of ridges (1, 

5, 9-12) separated by grooves (13-15), the method comprising a stage of 
laser resurfacing of the upper surfaces of the ridges (9-12) using a laser  

 
(27) directing a laser beam (28) onto an impact area (32) scanned along 

the upper surfaces of the ridges to be resurfaced and associated with a 
powder spray nozzle (33) directing onto the impact area (32) of the laser 

beam (28) a powder containing hard abrasion resistant material grains, the 
laser beam (28) having an intensity sufficient to melt the surface of the 

first material,
 
characterized in that the powder contains also a brazing metal alloy 

adapted to be melted by the laser beam (28) and to be brazed to said first 
material, adhering to the grains forming the hard abrasion resistant 

material powder, and in that the laser beam (28) has an intensity 
sufficient to melt the brazing metal alloy powder in the area of impact 

(32). 
Method according to claim 7 characterized in that a ridge is 
resurfaced in a plurality of successive passes during which the impact 

area (32) of a laser beam (28) and of the powder is moved along the entire 
length of the ridge, in alternate directions, the laser beam (28) being 

focused on each pass in an impact area (32) slightly greater than the 
width of the ridge, the motion of the laser beam (28) relative to the 

plate body (8) being reversed beyond the ends of the ridge. 
Method according to claim 7 or claim 8 characterized in that 
masks (49) of a material which reflects the laser beam (28) are used in 

areas (48) where the resurfacing is to be interrupted. 
Method according to claim 7 or claim 8 characterized in 
that masks (49) of a material absorbing the laser beam (28) and adapted to 

break down when heated are used in areas (48) where the resurfacing is to 
be interrupted. 
Method according to any one of claims 7 to 10 characterized 
in that a powder spray nozzle (33) coaxial with the laser beam (28) is 

used to impart to the powder a helical motion coaxial with the laser beam 
(28) and to concentrate the area of impact of the powder on the area of 

impact (32) of the laser beam (28) on the ridge to be resurfaced. 
Method according to any one of claims 7 to 11 characterized 
in that the size of the resurfacing area is adjusted by varying the area 

of impact (32) of the laser beam (28) by varying the distance of the focus 
(F) of the laser beam (28) relative to the surface (8) to be resurfaced.
