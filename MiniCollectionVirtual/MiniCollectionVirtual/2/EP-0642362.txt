<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel bone-bonding gel-derived
titania-based coatings. The invention also includes
processes for the preparation of such coatings and their
uses as surgical implants.Titanium and its alloys are extensively used in
reconstruction surgery as dental and orthopaedic implants
because of their excellent biocompatibility with bone
tissue (P.I. Brånemark, J. Prosthetic Dent. 50:399-410,
1983; D.I. Bardos, D. Williams (ed), Concise Encyclopedia
of Medical & Dental Materials, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1990,
pp 360-365; R. van Noort, J. Mater. Sci. 22:3801-3811,
1987). This can be explained by the unique characteristics
of titanium-bone interface. The extremely slow growth of
titanium oxide was observed during the implantation. The
TiOH groups within the hydrated oxide layer were considered
to be involved in the events leading to osseointegration of
the titanium implants (P. Tengwall & I Lundström, Clinical
Materials 9:115-134, 1992). The calcium and phosphorous
groups were identified in the few nanometer thick oxide
layer (D. Mcqueen et al, Clinical application of
Biomaterials, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, 1982, pp.
167-177). Although titanium implants could be fixed in bone
bed through osseointegration by using appropriate surgical
techniques, the fixation proceeds slowly and depends
largely on surgery (L. Sennerby, PhD thesis, University of
Gotenburg, Gotenburg, Sweden, 1991). To enhance the bonding
process and improve the bonding strength, the
plasma-sprayed coatings of apatite, more particularly
hydroxyapatite, were developed and approved for clinical
application (K. de Groot, J. Ceram. Soc. Japan 99:943-953,
1991). However, from a technical point of view, plasma
spraying is cumbersome and essentially complex, because
apatite powder is chemically unstable at elevated
temperatures. Implants can chemically bond to bone through apatite
because bone mineral is hydroxyapatite. These bone-bonding
implants could be wholly apatite ceramic or coated with
apatite using specific techniques such as plasma spray
coating process. Furthermore, apatite can also be used as a
bioactive phase in some composites to make them bond to
bone (K. Verheyen, Resorbable materials with bone bonding
ability, PhD thesis, Leiden University, Holland, 1993). In
contrast to those apatite-based materials, bioactive
glasses and glass-ceramics develop apatite layer onto their
surfaces after implantation within bone tissue (L. L.
Hench, Bioceramics: from concept to clinics, J. Am. Ceram.
Soc. 74:1487-510, 1991; T. Kokubo,
