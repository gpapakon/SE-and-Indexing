<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns liquid crystal polymer (LCP) materials and
method for preparing same.LCP's are known and are used in the electro-optical device industry, for
example, in optical storage devices, in non-linear optical devices and in
pyroelectric devices, see for example, GB 2146787 A and Makromol Chem, 186
2639-2647, 1985.One known type of LCP consists of a polymeric backbone to which are
attached pendant side chains which have a chemical structure that is
mesogenic, i.e. that induces liquid crystalline character, these being
known as side chain liquid crystal polymers. Work in this field has
identified a large number of side chain structures which are suitable, see
for example GB 2146787 A. For some purposes it is desirable that the LCP
shows a smectic C (Sc) or chiral smectic C (Sc*) liquid crystal phase. and
a particularly preferred side chain for achieving this is one which
contains a laterally fluorinated biphenyl or terphenyl system. Liquid crystal polyacrylates are known, Polymer Communications, 24,
364-365, 1988, having a polyacrylate backbone, eg. polymethacrylate, with
pendent side chains, ie. of general structure:
Where (CH2)m-X is the side chain and R is hydrogen or alkyl in the case of
polyalkylacrylates, being methyl in polymethacrylates.European Patent Application No. 0 357 850 Al discusses compositions of
co-polymers containing monomers based on a di-ester of itaconic acid.According to the present invention there is provided a LCP material
based on di-esters of itaconic acid having improved liquid crystal
properties over known polyacrylates of similar structure, having a general
formula I;
Where R1 and R2 may or may not be the same and have the following general structure:

may be independently selected from
p = 2-14;q = 0 or 1;r = 1 or 2;s = 1 or 2;X = O, CO2, O2C, CH2;Y = C2H4, O, CO2, O2C;
excluding X=O and X = CH2 when A = phenyl, r=s=1, Y=CO2, O2C and q=1.The general method of preparation of LCP's of formula I is by polymerisation of a
compound of general structure:
Wherein R1 and R2 have the general structure defined above. 4-cyano-4'-hydroxybiphenyl was stirred at room temperature with
11-bromoundecanoic acid and trifluoroacetic anhydride in dichloromethane
for 24 hours. Purification of the product was achieved by
recrystallisation from IMS.The purified product of step 1 was stirred at room temperature with
itaconic acid and sodium hydride in hexamethyl phosphoramide for 24 hours.
The solution was acidified and separated into ether. The product was
purified by
