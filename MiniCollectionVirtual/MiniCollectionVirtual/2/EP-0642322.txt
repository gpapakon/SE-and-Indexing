<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for the cosmetical treatment of the human body through removal of the adipose tissue masses by means of the combined effect of the infiltration of a diluent solution and the application of a fluidizing perturbation within the adipose tissue (A), so as to enable the subsequent extraction thereof. The fluidizing perturbation is generated by the emission of electromagnetic waves by means of a pair of electrodes, at least one of which is directly associated to a tubular perforator (9, 10) through which the diluent solution is infiltrated and/or the fluidized adipose tissue is extracted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to cosmetical treatments of 
the human body, and is more particularly concerned with an 
apparatus for the removal of masses of adipose or fatty 
tissue according to the preamble of claim 1. A system for the removal of masses of adipose or fatty 
tissue, comprising a fluidizing step by means of the combined 
effect of infiltration of a diluent solution and application 
of a fluidizing perturbation within the adipose tissue, and a 
step of extraction of the fluidized adipose tissue, is 
disclosed, for example, in Italian magazine "Salve", No. 2 
February 1992, RCS Rizzoli Periodici. This known system, the 
final purpose of which is to produce (according to EP-A-0418979) 
autologous collagene from the human adipose tissue, 
contemplates for removal of the adipose tissue firstly the 
surgical cut of the body area to be treated, subsequently the 
introduction through the cut of a cannula for the 
infiltration of an anaesthetic and diluting solution, and 
then the insertion of a probe-lancet provided with a 
piezoelectric transducer for the generation of ultra-sounds. 
The ultra-sounds produce high frequency mechanical 
vibrations, and thus shock waves which impact the molecules 
of the endo-cellular substances thus causing the crushing of 
the adipocites. A cellular emulsion is then produced, 
constituted by the contents of the fatty cells fragments, by 
inter-cellular substances and by the preliminarly injected 
solution. These substances are subsequently removed by means 
of a "squeezing" action, whereby the liquified fat is drawn  
 
outside the surgical cuts by squeezing, energetically 
massaging the treated part by means of a roller device. This system has a series of drawbacks: firstly, it involves a 
real surgical operation, with the need of subsequent suture 
of the cuts and consequent dressings, as well as stay in 
hospital. Secondly, for these very reasons, the treatment can 
be only performed locally, and repetition thereof in 
different areas of the body can be made only after a certain 
period of time. Last but not least, the treatment requires 
the intervention of a specialized surgeon and of a medical 
staff. EP-A-0331313 and WO-A-91/12774 are also directed to soft 
tissue aspiration, employing in the first case ultrasonic 
vibration and in the second case laser energy. Namely, EP-A-0331313 
relates to an apparatus as defined in the preamble of 
claim 1. The fluidizing perturbation is carried out by means 
of an ultrasonic aspirating probe. The probe is 
ultras
