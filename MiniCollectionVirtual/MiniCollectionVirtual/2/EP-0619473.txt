<ABSTRACT>
A vortex flowmeter includes a body (10) having a flow 
passage (11), a vortex generator (12) in the flow passage 

(11), and a first wing (15) and a second wing (16) in the 
passage downstream of the generator (12). The vortex 

generator (12) generates a standing transverse wave (20). A 
circuit (22, 25) utilizing sensors (18, 19) in wings (15, 16) 

is provided for first determining an operational phase 
difference, Δ
m
 between the signals representing movement of 
the first and second wings (15, 16). A microprocessor (22) 

then determines a corrected vortex frequency, f
corr
, in 
response to a ratio of a predetermined calibration phase 

difference Δ
c
 to the measured phase difference Δ
m
.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a meter for measuring fluid
flow by detecting Karman vortices. In particular, the
invention is an improved vortex flowmeter that compensates
for changes in the Strouhal Number, dimensional changes of a
bluff body, or for measurement error associated with
conditions in a pipe which distort the fluid velocity
profile.The accuracy of vortex flowmeters depends in part on
using a proper value for the Strouhal Number, Ns. The
Strouhal Number is a non-dimensional flow number that is
related to the stability of fluid flow when an obstruction is
placed in the flow. Once the Strouhal Number is determined
or calibrated for a particular vortex flowmeter, it typically
remains constant when the meter operates. This means that
the Strouhal Number can usually be pre-determined before
installation without sacrificing flowmeter accuracy.
However, the Strouhal Number changes substantially at very
high (i.e. 2,000,000) or very low (i.e. 20,000) Reynold's
Number, Re. It also makes an apparent change when piping
conditions are altered from ideal conditions, which is
illustrated by small errors in measurement. In these
circumstances, or any other circumstances where the Strouhal
Number changes after installation, a vortex flowmeter might
not be accurate.The accuracy of vortex flowmeters also depends in part
on using the proper characteristic dimension for an
obstruction (i.e., a bluff body) placed in the flow path. As
vortex flowmeters operate over time, these obstructions tend
to erode and their characteristic dimension changes. In
time, this causes vortex flowmeters to be inaccurate.In addition, the accuracy of an ordinary vortex
flowmeters depends on the velocity profile of the fluid as it
approaches and impinges on the bluff body. For vortex 
flowmeters to be accurate, it is usually required that the
velocity profile be fully developed. Certain portions of
piping such as elbow or expanders distort a velocity profile.
Therefore, ordinary vortex flowmeter should be installed only
after many pipe diameters of straight pipe. This can be a
burdensome requirement. Especially since velocity profiles
can be distorted not only after pipe bends, but also when
internal pipe diameters are mismatched at pipe joints, or
even when the friction factor of pipe walls changes.In general, the operation of vortex flowmeters is well
known. An elongated obstruction, called a bluff body, is
placed transverse to the direction of fluid flow within a
conduit and generates vortices in its wake. The vortices are
induced by
