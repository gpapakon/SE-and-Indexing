<ABSTRACT>
Surface and near surface hardened medical implants are
provided. These implants are fabricated from titanium alloys that

contain an amount of zirconium sufficient to permit the formation of
a significant amount of zirconium oxide at the surface of the implant

to cause surface hardening. Further, the zirconium-containing
titanium alloy implants are characterized in having an alloy core with

an oxygen-rich layer surrounding the core, and a surface layer,
overlying the oxygen-rich layer, including mixed oxides of the metals

present in the alloy. A zirconium-rich interface may sometimes be
present between the oxygen-rich layer and the mixed-oxide surface

layer. The method of producing these surface hardened implants
includes the steps of heating the implant in an oxygen containing

environment at a temperature sufficient to allow oxygen to diffuse to
and react with the implant surface and near surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surface hardened
zirconium-containing titanium medical implants, and in particular
such hardened implants where the surface and near surface region
is comprised of a mixed-oxide surface layer and an underlying near-surface-oxygen-rich
solution layer. A zirconium-rich interface
develops, in some instances, between the mixed oxide layer and the
oxygen-rich solution. In particular, these surface hardened
zirconium-containing titanium implants may be produced by an
elevated temperature process which permits the diffusion of oxygen
into the near surface of the implants. This invention is especially
useful for medical implants but is also useful for other applications
in which improvement in wear resistance of titanium alloys is
beneficial.Titanium alloys are used extensively in medical implants such
as hip joint prostheses, knee joint prostheses, spinal implants, bone
plate systems, intramedullary nails, dental implants, cardiovascular
implants, ear-nose-and-throat implants, etc., due to their high
strength, low modulus, excellent biocompatibility and corrosion
resistance. However, a major disadvantage of titanium alloys is
their susceptibility to wear and galling.Minimizing wear debris generated by orthopedic devices,
such as hip joint and knee joint prostheses, is an issue of concern in
orthopedics. Wear debris generated by orthopedic devices has
been associated with a phenomenon called "osteolysis," a term
used to describe death of bone cells. This can lead to premature
loosening of an orthopedic implant from surrounding bone and
subsequent failure of the device.Titanium alloys are also susceptible to a phenomenon called
"galling," essentially the sticking together of mating titanium parts
which move against each other leading to high friction and wear.Numerous methods have been proposed for increasing the
surface hardness and reducing the wear and galling of titanium 
alloys. Ceramic coatings, such as titanium nitride, have been
deposited on these alloys by processes such as physical vapor
deposition and chemical vapor deposition (see, for example,
Hintermann, U.S. patent 4,687,487). However, these ceramic
coatings are much harder and stiffer than the base alloy substrate
so that there is an abrupt mismatch in the stiffness of the coating
and the substrate at the interface between the two. The elastic
modulus (stiffness) of a titanium nitride coating is typically about
400 GPa while that of most titanium alloys is about 65 to 130 GPa.
This modulus mismatch leads to undesirable
