<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the transfer of user data in packet format in a digital cellular radio system comprising at least one organization channel common to all mobile stations (MS) for sending pages, connection requests, and channel assignements, so as to establish an actual connection on another channel. In the invention, the user data is transferred in packet format from the mobile stations (MS) to the base station (BTS1-BTS4) in modified paging messages which are sent on the organization channel interleaved with normal paging messages but will not result in a normal connection establishment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to packet data transfer in
a digital cellular radio system.Advanced digital cellular systems typically
offer a circuit-switched data channel for data
applications. As is well-known, circuit-switched
connections are very heavy to establish. In addition,
at least one traffic channel of the system capacity
has to be allocated to the circuit-switched connection
until the connection is released. For these reasons,
circuit-switched data connections are suitable mainly
for applications which continuously require a transfer
capacity of one transfer channel of the system for
relatively long periods of time. Allocation of a
circuit-switched channel for the transfer is a typical
example of applications suitable for the system.Many data applications involve a low, randomly
occurring transfer demand and a need to keep the
(virtual) transfer connection open continuously. A
circuit-switched connection is not suitable for such
purposes as the resources of the cellular system are
reserved unreasonably, and the implementation of a
service would therefore become too expensive.Advanced digital cellular systems also comprise
a short message service. A short message may be used
in data services for the transfer of small amounts of
data. In the GSM system, for instance, sending a short
message is similar to a conventional call set-up procedure,
i.e. it is a very heavy signalling event. The
applicability of short messages in the establishment
of economical data connections is therefore limited. There are prior art packet-switched radio
systems implemented for data applications. Such
systems require separate network investments for data
connections. As the modern cellular systems as such
comprise functions useful for data applications, it is
advantageous to aim at utilizing these functions in
providing economical data connections.EP-A-0332818 discloses a packet-switched cellular
system comprising a cellular switch and base sites for
providing packet-switched data services to cellular
mobile stations. Base sites are coupled to the cellular
switch by T1 span lines which are coupled to the
landline telephone network. All the slots in the span
lines are clear channels containing no trunk signalling
information, one time slot in each direction being
dedicated for common channel signalling. Multiple data
calls are assigned to each packet-mode radio channel to
conserve the radio channel spectrum.EP-A-0332825 discloses a cellular data telephone
system including a data control unit and a buffer for
storing transmit

Method for the transfer of user data in
packet format in a digital cellular radio system comprising

base stations (BTS1-BTS4) for radio communication with
mobile radio stations (MS), each one of the base stations

comprising at least one organization channel (CCCH) shared by
all of the mobile radio stations (MS) for sending pages

from the base station (BTS) to the mobile stations, for
sending connection requests from the mobile stations

to the base station, and for sending channel assignments
to the mobile stations so as to establish an

actual connection on another channel, 
characterized

by

generating modified paging messages which will
not result in a normal connection establishment;
adding user data in packet format to said modified
messages; and
sending said modified messages on the organization
channel (CCCH) interleaved with normal paging messages.

comprises a message type identifier different from

that of a normal paging message, and a data area added
for user data to the end of the normal paging message.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that said at least one organization
channel of the base station comprises a first

control channel (PCH) for sending pages from the base station
to the mobile stations; a second control channel (RACH)

for transmitting connection request messages from the
mobile stations to the base station; and a third control

channel (AGCH) for sending acknowledgement messages from
the base station to the mobile radio stations.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the transfer of packet data

from the base station to a mobile station comprises

a) sending a packet message containing user data
on the first control channel (PCH) to the mobile radio

station;
b) sending a response message as an acknowledgement
on the second control channel (RACH) to the

base station; and
c) repeating steps a) and b) for each data
packet to be transferred.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized

in that the cellular radio

the first control channel is a Paging channel (PCH), the
second control channel is a Random Access channel (RACH); and

the third control channel is an Access Grant channel (AGCH).
Method according to any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized

in that the cellular radio
system is the digital GSM mobile radio system, and

that the modified paging message is formed from the
Paging Request message.
Mobile station for a digital cellular radio
