<ABSTRACT>
In the purification of crude tetrachlorophthalic anhydride containing 
hexachlorobenzene as impurities, this invention relates to purification 

by decomposition in which crude tetrachlorophthalic anhydride is 
contacted with chlorine gas in fuming sulfuric acid or sulfuric 

anhydride in the presence of iodine or iodine trichloride to decompose 
the impurities and remove them or purification by washing in which 

hexachlorobenzene is separated by washing with a chlorinated solvent. 
This invention also relates to a process for purifying crude 

tetrachlorophthalic anhydride containing iodotrichlorophthalic 
anhydrides as impurities by applying a radical reaction treatment in a 

chlorinated solvent to convert iodotrichlorophthalic anhydrides to 
tetrachloro
phthalic anhydride. Moreover, it relates to high-purity 
tetrachlorophthalic anhydride containing 10 ppm or less of 

hexachlorobenzene. With the process of this invention, it is possible to 
recover high-purity tetrachlorophthalic anhydride with extremely low 

contents of impurities readily in high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a purifying process for obtaining high-purity 
tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, and, particularly, to a process 
for purifying crude tetrachlorophthalic anhydride which contains harmful 
hexachlorobenzene and/or unwanted iodotrichlorophthalic anhydrides as 
impurities and yielding high-purity tetrachlorophthalic anhydride with 
the contents of these impurities reduced as much as possible. In 
particular, this invention relates to a process for obtaining high-purity tetrachlorophthalic 
anhydride with an extremely low content of hexachlorobenzene. Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride finds a wide variety of uses such as 
raw materials for perione dyes and quinophthalone dyes which are useful 
for coloring resins, raw materials for isoindolinone pigments and 
phthalocyanine pigments which are useful for coatings and printing inks 
and flame retardants for multipurpose synthetic resins such as 
polyesters, polyurethanes and polyols. The following processes are known mainly for the manufacture of  
 
tetrachlorophthalic anhydride: a vapor-phase chlorination process in 
which phthalic anhydride is contacted with chlorine gas in the vapor 
phase [Japan Tokkyo Koho No. Sho 38-25,365 (1963), Japan Kokai Tokkyo 
Koho No. Sho 60-161,974 (1985) and Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho No. Sho 62-185,082 
(1987)]; a liquid-phase chlorination process in which phthalic 
anhydride is contacted with chlorine gas in a solvent [Japan Kokai 
Tokkyo Koho No. 61-118,378 (1986) and West German Patent No. 
1,934,174]; and a chlorination process in which naphthalene is contacted 
with chlorine gas in a solvent [Walter, Monatsh. Chem. Vol. 64, p 287 
(1934), West Germany]. Of the processes cited above, a manufacturing process based on the 
vapor-phase process inevitably produces a variety of chlorinated 
byproducts in the course of reaction and, as described in the cited 
literature, some of such byproducts mainly consist of polychlorobenzenes 
which are regarded harmful to the human body as exemplified by 
hexachlorobenzene (HCB). In consequence, whenever tetrachlorophthalic anhydride containing the 
aforesaid byproducts as impurities is used directly as additives to 
synthetic resins, for example, as flame retardants or as intermediates 
for the manufacture of dyes and pigments, the final commercial products 
such as resins, dyes and pigments become contaminated with these 
byproducts. The contaminated products are restricted in usage under a 
variety of official regulations and, particularly in the fields related 
to
