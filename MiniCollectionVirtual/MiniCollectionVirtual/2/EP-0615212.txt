<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing mail pieces at high speed uses upstream 
and downstream processing stations. A mail piece is presented to an 

upstream processing station for processing. While the mail piece 
is at the upstream processing station, processing means is activated 

at the downstream processing station. After completion of processing 
of the mail piece at the upstream station, the mail piece is advanced 

to the downstream station while the processing means therein remain 
activated to thereby reduce the processing time at the downstream 

station. Moreover, the speed of advance to the downstream station is 
adjusted in accordance with the size or thickness of the mail piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of processing mailpieces at high speed, see US-A-3 877 531 or GB-A-2 195
312, for example.Automatic mailing machines typically include imprinting systems, such as postage meters where the information
imprinted on the envelope or other sheet-like medium is attributable to a variable parameter of the medium, for example
imprinting a postage value indicia on an envelope wherein the postage value is based on the weight of the envelope.In the mail processing field, it is desirable for a system operator to be able to deliver to mail processing equipment
a batch of "mixed mail," that is, a batch comprised of a large number of envelopes of varying dimensions, and
variable thickness or weight. The ability of a mail processing system to process a large variety of mixed mail eliminates
the need for the system operator to perform a preliminary step of presorting the mail. It is further desirable for mail
processing equipment to be able to weigh the individual envelopes and affix the appropriate postage value indicia in
accordance with the envelope weight. It is generally considered advantageous if the mail processing equipment can
imprint quality indicia upon envelopes varying in thickness from that of a postcard to approximately three-quarters
(3/4) of an inch, i.e. 19 mm.It is known a provide mail processing equipment comprised of a feeder for singularly delivering envelope in series
to a transport assembly. The transport assembly deposits the envelope on a scale for weighing. After a sufficient time
to assure a true scale reading of the envelope weight, commonly referred to as "weigh on the pause," the transport
assembly again assumes control over the envelope and delivers the envelope to a so-called mailing machine. Such a
mailing machine Is most commonly comprised of an integral transport assembly and attached rotary print drum type
postage meter. The mailing machine transport assembly assumes speed control over the envelope, performing any
necessary speed adjustments to the envelope required to match the envelope traversing speed with the imprinting
speed of the postage mater print drum to promote a quality indicia print It is known for the postage meter to include
a value setting mechanism and to adjust the postage meter printing mechanism for printing of the appropriate postage
rate on the approaching envelope according to the envelope weight as determined by the scale. Reference is, made
to commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 3,877,531 which describes in greater detail a

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing mixed mail pieces of varying thickness and size
at high speed, comprising the steps of:


(a) providing upstream and downstream processing stations
(15,17,19,21,23);
(b) presenting a mail piece to an upstream processing station for
processing;
(c) while the mail piece is at the upstream processing station,
activating processing means at the downstream processing station;
(d) after completion of processing of the mail piece at the upstream
station, advancing the mail piece to the downstream station while the processing

means therein remain activated to thereby reduce the processing time at the
downstream station; and 
characterized by
(e) adjusting the speed of transport to the downstream station in
accordance with the size or thickness of the mail piece.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the upstream station (19) performs flap
sealing and the downstream station (27, 35) performs indicia printing.
A method for processing mixed mail pieces of varying thickness and size
at high speed, in a mailing machine which includes a mail piece flow path,

comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing in the mail piece flow path processing stations (17, 19,
21, 25, 27, 35) for singulating, sealing, weighing and printing;
(b) subjecting the mail pieces to a singulation at a singulating station
(17);
(c) while the mail piece is still at the singulating station, activating the
sealing station (19, 21);
(d) after completion of processing of the mail piece at the singulating
station, advancing the mail piece to the station for sealing while the processing

means therein remain activated to thereby reduce the processing time at the
sealing station;
(e) while the mail piece is at the sealing station for sealing, activating
processing means at the weighing station (23, 25);
(f) after completion of processing of the mail piece at the sealing
station, advancing the mail piece to the weighing station while the processing

means therein remain activated to thereby reduce the processing time at the
weighing station;
(g) while the mail piece is undergoing weighing, activating processing
means (27, 35) for performing the printing function;
(h) after completion of weighing of the mail piece, subjecting the mail
piece to printing while the processing means therein remain activated to thereby

reduce the printing time;
(i) while the mail piece is undergoing printing, activating means (33)
for removing the printed mail piece from the printing station;
(j) after completion of printing, subjecting the printed mail piece to the
removing means; and
(k) adjusting the transport velocity of the operating station at which the
mail piece 
is located in accordance with the size or thickness of the mail piece.
