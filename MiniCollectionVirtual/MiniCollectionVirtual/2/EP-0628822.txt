<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to systems and
methods for analyzing solutions such as blood samples,
and more specifically, to such systems and methods that
analyze blood samples by detecting and quantifying
agglutinates formed in those samples in response to
immunological reactions. Even more particularly, the
invention relates to an automated system and method for
analyzing blood samples in this way.Immunological agglutination reactions are used
for identifying various kinds of blood types and for
detecting various kinds of antibodies and antigens in
blood samples and other aqueous solutions. In a
conventional procedure, a sample of red blood cells is
mixed with serum or plasma in test tubes or microplates,
and the mixture may then be incubated and centrifuged.
Various reactions either occur or do not occur depending
on, for example, the blood type of the red blood cells
or whether certain antibodies are present in the blood
sample. Typically, these reactions manifest themselves
as clumps of cells or particles with antigens or
antibodies on their surfaces, referred to as
agglutinates. Thus, the absence of any such clumps
indicates that no reaction has occurred; and the
presence of such clumps indicates that a reaction has
occurred, with the size and amount of such clumps being
a quantitative indicator of the level or concentration
in the sample, or an indicator of the reaction strength,
affinity of the complex for which the blood sample was tested. Recently, a new agglutination test method
--referred to as column agglutination technology, or
CAT-- has been developed. Column Agglutination
Technology may be defined as the analysis of blood and
blood products utilizing filtration as a means of
separating agglutinated, precipitated, absorbed or
adsorbed particulate components from non-reactive
components for immunoassay applications. In this
method, gel or glass bead microparticles are contained
within a small column, referred to as a microcolumn. A
reagent such as anti-A is dispensed in a diluent in the
microcolumn and test red blood cells are placed in a
reaction chamber above the column. The column, which is
typically one of a multitude of columns formed in a
transparent cassette, is centrifuged. The centrifuging
accelerates the reaction, if any, between the reagent
and the blood cells, and also urges any cells toward the
bottom of the column. The glass beads or gel in the
microcolumn act as a filter, however, and resist or
impede downward movement of the particles in the column.
As a result, the
