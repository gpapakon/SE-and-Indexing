 FOR ATION OF COLLOIDAL METAL DISPERSIONS USING AMINODEXTRANS AS REDUCTANTS AND PROTECTIVE AGENTSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to a method for the preparation of stable colloidal metal particles having a crosslinked polysaccharide coating with functional groups attached thereto. More specifically, the invention is directed to a method for preparing selected colloidal metal particles, using an aminodextran as both the metal ion reductant and the protective coating agent for the colloidal particles produced, the aminodextran coated on the particles being stabilized by use of crosslinking agents.BACKGROUND ART Metal ions in solution are attracted to the vicinity of functionalized polymer molecules. The reduction of the metal ions to metal(O) atoms creates a condition of supersaturation with respect to metal(O) atoms at a given polymer site. Consequently, the nucleation of metal particles proceeds in the local domain of the individual polymer molecules. Steric repulsion between different polymer-metal domains keeps the domains separated while attractive forces between the polymer's functional groups and metal atoms on a particle keeps the particle in a single domain. The net effect is the immobilization of metallic nuclei by individual polymer molecules and the prevention of w*=*„ metal(O) particle growth by coagulation, i.e., nuclei from different polymer molecules are prevented from migrating and coagulating to form larger particles.While polymer molecules may prevent metal(O) particle growth by coagulation, particle growth can occur by the diffusion of metal ions to the vicinity of the metal(O) particle nuclei. The growth of the particles is terminated when the solution is depleted 

of metal ions capable of migration. The metal(O) particles that are formed are uniform in size and shape. Further information on homogeneous precipita¬ tion, may be found in A.E. Nielsen, "Kinetics of Precipitation" (McMillan, New York 1964); E. Matijevic, Accts. Chem. Res., 14: 22 (1981); and T. Sugimoto, Adv. Coll. Interface Sci., 25: 65-108 (1987).Colloidal dispersions of different metals have been prepared through a judicious choice of polymer, metal ion, reducing agent, the selective concentrations of the various ingredients and the temperature at which the reactions are carried out. Simple alcohols such as methanol or ethanol have been used as both solvent and reductant in the presence of a protecting polymer such as PVA (polyvinyl acetate). Polyols, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol have been
