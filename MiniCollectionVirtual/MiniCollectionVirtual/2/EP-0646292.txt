<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an electrically conductive sealing compound for a set of contacts for sparking plugs which is arranged between the terminal and ignition sides of a central electrode, the sealing compound containing essentially a meltable glass component and a powdered electrically conductive component. The electrically conductive component of the sealing compound consists solely of graphite and represents 10 to 30 vol. % in relation to the powdered components of the sealing compound.

<CLAIMS>
Electrically conducting sealing compound for a 
spark plug for sealing in between a terminal-side section 

and a spark-side section of a centre electrode, which 
sealing compound essentially contains a fusible glass 

component and a powdered, electrically conducting component, 
characterized in that the electrically conducting 

component contains graphite which is, at least almost, 
free of soot crystal structures, the soot being present 

in the graphite at most as an impurity. 
Sealing compound according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the graphite is free of soot crystal structures. 
Sealing compound according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the graphite is used in an amount 

of 10 to 30% by volume, based on the powdered components 
contained in the sealing compound. 
Sealing compound according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the graphite is used in an amount of 18 to 

22% by volume, based on the powdered components contained 
in the sealing compound. 
Sealing compound according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the graphite has a mean grain 

size of 20 to 50 µm. 
Sealing compound according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the graphite has a grain size of 30 to 

40 µm, and in that the proportion of the mean grain size 
below 10 µm is 
<
 5% and the proportion of the grain size 
above 96 µm is 
<
 10%. 
Sealing compound according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the sealing compound on 
the terminal-side centre electrode (13) forms a terminal-side 

contact core (15) and on the spark-side centre 
electrode (14) forms a spark-side contact core (16), and 

in that the height, measured in the axial direction of 
the centre electrode (13, 14), of the terminal-side 

contact core (15) is greater than the height of the 
spark-side contact core (16). 
Sealing compound according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that a resistance core (17) is arranged 

between the terminal-side contact core (15) and the 
spark-side contact core (16), and in that the spacing 

between that end face of the spark-side centre electrode 
(14) which is on the sealing side and the resistance core 

(17) is at least 0.5 and the spacing between that end 
face of the terminal-side centre electrode (13) which is 

on the sealing side and the resistance core (17) is at 
least 2 millimetres.
