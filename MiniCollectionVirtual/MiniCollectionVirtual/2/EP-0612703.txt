<ABSTRACT>
The process for the manufacture of carbonaceous articles comprises a stage a) of manufacture of raw carbonaceous articles obtained typically by forming a mixture of carbonaceous powder and of a binder, a stage b) of curing of the said raw carbonaceous articles, and is characterised in that, to carry out the curing stage b), on the one hand the said raw carbonaceous articles are placed in a furnace with electrical heating and the said temperature rise is produced under circulation of a nonoxidative gaseous atmosphere in order to lower locally the partial pressure of volatile products and, on the other hand, the mechanical stresses of the said raw carbonaceous articles are relieved before the departure of the volatile products during the curing.

A process for manufacturing carbonaceous pieces comprising a step a) for
manufacturing crude carbonaceous pieces which are typically obtained by

heat shaping a mixture of carbonaceous powder and a bonding agent, followed by a
cooling operation, at ambient temperature, of said carbonaceous pieces shaped,

a step b) for firing said crude carbonaceous pieces in a furnace, comprising
a temperature rise of said crude carbonaceous pieces from ambient temperature

to a temperature which can exceed 800°c, bringing about the departure of
volatile products (debonding) in such a way that fired carbonaceous pieces are

obtained which have no volatile products, characterised in that in order to
increase the speed of said temperature increase in firing step b),


1) said crude carbonaceous pieces are first of all placed (without any heating
filler) in an electrical heating furnace and
2) a heating speed is then selected for said pieces up to 200°C prior to any
significant departure of said volatile products (
<
 10% of the volatile
products) as a function of the speed of said cooling process in step a), an

increase to said heating speed corresponding to a reduction in the cooling
speed in step a), in such a way that the stresses resulting from step a) are

freed, and
3) said temperature increase is carried out by circulating a non-oxidising
gaseous atmosphere (gaseous sweeping flow) around said crude carbonaceous

pieces, by locally reducing the partial pressure of the volatile products.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein an electrical resistance or
induction heating furnace is used.
A process according to Claim 2 in which in order to promote the
elimination of volatile products contained in said crude carbonaceous products

said non-oxidising gaseous atmosphere circulates at the surface of said
carbonaceous pieces (pieces not surrounded by protective powder) with a

gaseous front which advances at least at the speed of 0.5 cm/min and
preferably between 5 cm/min and 30 cm/min.
A process according to Claim 3, in which said non-oxidising gaseous
atmosphere is selected, preferably from nitrogen, argon and helium. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 in which the mechanical
stresses are freed prior to the departure of said volatile product
s by
selecting a heating speed for said crude carbonaceous pieces which is less

than 100°C/h up to a temperature of 200°C, and which becomes lower as the
cooling speed of the crude carbonaceous pieces increases in step a).
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 in which the speed of
said temperature increase is governed by the flux of volatile products which

are set free, in such a way that a given flux is obtained.
A process according to Claim 6 in which said given flux is kept between
5 and 65% by weight of the total mass of volatile products / h.
A process according to Claim 7 in which said given flux is preferably
kept between 20 and 40% by weight of the total mass of the volatile product / h.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8 in which the ratio of
"mass of volatile products / mass of gas in said non-oxidising atmosphere" is

kept to less than 3 and to preferably less than 1 in the gaseous atmosphere
surrounding the pieces to be fired during the firing operation.
A process according to Claim 9 in which in order to limit the
consumption of said gas in the way which is strictly necessary the flow of

said gas is governed by the volatilization speed of the volatile products, in
such a way that said ratio maintains a value which is basically constant and

close to 1 throughout the firing phase.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10 comprising a step d)
for densification of the crude carbonaceous pieces through chemical deposition

in vapour phase (CDVP), which step is carried out in said same furnace by the
cracking of a gas with a high carbon content (methane or natural gas) at

reduced pressure at temperatures of between 800 and 1200°C, in such a way that
dense carbonaceous pieces are obtained.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 11 comprising a step c)
for graphiting said crude carbonaceous pieces (which have been densified, or 

not, by CDVP), which step is carried out in said same furnace, without any
heating filler, in a non-oxidising atmosphere (atmosphere typically of

nitrogen or argon at atmospheric pressure or at reduced pressure under vacuum)
surrounding said crude carbonaceous pieces, bringing said crude carbonaceous

pieces to a temperature of at least 2300°C at a increase speed of between
400°C/h and 1900°C, preferably close to 800°C/h.
A process according to Claim 12 in which said graphiting step c) is
followed by a densification step in such a way that the operation for cooling

a graphited piece is used to further densify it in said same furnace.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 13 in which said furnace
is provided with means which make it possible to regulate the amount of

heating energy provided and to pilot control the temperature of said
carbonaceous pieces (crude or fired, graphited or not, dense or otherwise),

and means for controlling said gaseous sweeping flux, in such a way as to
control the type, pressure and flow of the gaseous atmosphere surrounding said

carbonaceous pieces, and to thus be able to carry out steps b) and possibly
step c) and/or step d) of said process automatically in accordance with given

requirements.
A process according to Claim 14 in which said furnace is provided with
means which make it possible to measure the flux of volatile products which

are freed and means for making said gaseous sweeping flux and said heating
energy supplied be governed by said flux in such a way that the flux of

volatile products set free is kept at a given value (amount of volatile
products which are set free per hour).
A process according to Claim 14 in which said furnace is provided with
means which make it possible for a temperature curve to be memorised as a

function of the given time (in particular, increase speed), obtained from
initial tests, and for providing pilot control of said temperature of said

carbonaceous pieces along said temperature curve, in such a way that the real
temperature of said carbonaceous pieces follows said temperature curve with

the passage of time.
