<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to modified acrylonitrile polymers which absorb metal ions and are obtainable by   a) reaction of an acrylonitrile polymer with hydroxylamine or a derivative thereof or with a mixture of hydroxylamine and a derivative thereof, and b) treatment of the product from step a) with an oxidant (oxidizing agent).   The modified acrylonitrile polymer can be employed, in particular, for the purification of water or effluent polluted with heavy-metal ions.
