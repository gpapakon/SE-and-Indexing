<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a prior art control system which establishes reference braking torques for the driven wheels of a motor vehicle. The smaller of the torques is used to regulate an engine braking torque and the remaining braking torques are applied by brake-pressure control.

Method for setting target braking torques M
set1
 
and M
set2
 at the driven wheels of a motor vehicle, 
characterized in that the smaller target braking torque 

(M
set1
 or M
set2
) is used to set an engine braking torque of 
an appropriate magnitude and in that the residual braking 

torques M
R1
 and M
R2
 are produced by the application of 
braking pressure. 
Method for setting target braking torques (M
set1
 
and M
set2
) at the driven wheels of a motor vehicle, 
characterized in that the smallest of the target braking 

torques M
setmin
 is selected, in that, by means of an 
engine control, an engine torque 


M
eng
 = 2 * KM
setmin
/i + i * 
ges
 * bx/r 
 
is set, i being the product of the gear transmission 

ratio and the transmission ratio of the differential, 
ges
 
being the sum of the moments of inertia of the engine and 

the gearbox, bx being the vehicle deceleration, r being 
the radius of the wheel and K being a variable between 0 

and 1 and becoming smaller with increasing admission 
pressure, and in that the residual torques M
set1
-M
setmin
 
and M
set2
-M
setmin
 are converted into appropriate braking 
pressures P1 and P2.
