<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to catalysts for the preparation of bis-para-aminocyclohexylmethane by hydrogenation of methylenedianiline, ruthenium or rhodium being applied to a support in an amount of from 0.05 to 8% by weight, preferably 0.2 to 3% by weight in a layer thickness of from 5 to 150  mu m, preferably 10 to 80  mu m, which support comprises a calcined and superficially rehydrated transitional alumina, this alumina giving, in a suspension of 10 g in 300 ml of water at 25 DEG C after 60 min, at least an equilibrium pH of 8.2 and, after addition of 10 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid to this suspension, at least a pH still of 6.0 after 30 minutes. Particularly suitable supports predominantly comprise hydrargillite or bayerite. To achieve the values required, the support can be furnished with an additional coating. The invention further describes a process for producing the catalyst and use therefore.

<CLAIMS>
A catalyst for preparing bis-para-aminocyclohexylmethane 
by hydrogenation of methylenedianiline, 

characterized in that ruthenium or rhodium in an 
amount of from 0.05 to 8 % by weight, preferably 

from 0.2 to 3 % by weight, is applied with a layer 
thickness of from 5 to 150 µm, preferably from 10 

to 80 µm, to a support comprising a calcined and 
surface-rehydrated transition alumina, a 

suspension of 10 g of this uncoated alumina in 300 
ml of water at 25°C having an equilibrium pH of at 

least 8.2 after 60 minutes and still having a pH 
of at least 6.0 30 minutes after addition of 10 ml 

of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid to it. 
A catalyst according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the support has an internal BET surface area 

of at least 70 m
2
/g and an open porosity of at 
least 0.1 ml/g. 
A catalyst according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the rehydrated alumina phase 

comprises predominantly hydrargillite or bayerite. 
A catalyst according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the support has a very rough 

surface with peak-to-valley heights of from 50 to 
200 µm. 
A catalyst according to claim 1, characterized in 
that alumina supports having lower equilibrium pH 

values are provided with a surface coating of 
oxides and/or hydroxides of aluminium, iron, 

yttrium or the lanthanides to achieve the required 
values.  

 
A catalyst according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the support has a BET surface area of at 

least 3 m
2
/g, an open porosity of at least 0.04 
ml/g and a peak-to-valley height of the surface of 

at least 50 µm. 
A process for preparing a catalyst according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the support, while 

being circulated at a temperature of at least 
80°C, is sprayed with a dilute ruthenium nitrosyl 

nitrate solution and is subsequently dried. 
A process according to claim 7, characterized in 
that subsequent to drying a further reduction is 

carried out in hydrogen at a pressure of at least 
30 kPa (0.3 bar) at temperatures from 70 to 400°C, 

preferably from 140 to 250°C. 
Use of a catalyst according to any of claims 1 to 
6 for hydrogenating methylenedianiline to bis-para-aminocyclohexylmethane 

at a temperature from 
140 to 220°C and a pressure from 6 to 40 MPa (60 

to 400 bar).
