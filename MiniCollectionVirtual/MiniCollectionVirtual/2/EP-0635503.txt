<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain new 
spiroheterocyclic compounds having fungicidal properties, 
processes for the preparation of these compounds, fungicidal 
compositions containing the compounds and the use of the 
compounds as fungicides for the control of phytopathogenic 
fungi. In EP 281842, EP 349247, EP 413223 and WO 92/16518 
fungicidal spiroheterocyclic compounds have been described. 
These known compounds contain a substituted cyclohexyl ring 
in spiro conjunction with a substituted heterocyclic five or 
six membered ring. The substituents of the cyclohexyl ring 
are usually (substituted) (branched) alkyl or phenyl groups. 
The substituents of the heterocyclic ring are usually 
(substituted) (cyclo)alkyl- or dialkyl-amino-methyl or 
dialkyl-amino-polymethyl groups, including alkylene-amino-methyl 
or alkylene-amino-polymethyl groups. It has now been found that certain new 
spiroheterocyclic compounds show excellent fungicidal 
activity against certain phytopathogenic fungi, for instance 
against Plasmoporaviticola, Botrytiscinera, Erysiphegraminis, 
Pseudocercosporellaherpotrichoides, Rhizoctoniasolani, 
Venturiainaequalis and Alternariasolani. The present invention therefore relates to compounds of 
the general formula I 
or an acid-addition salt thereof, in which 
R¹ or each R¹
 
independently represents an optionally substituted 
alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkoxy, 
cycloalkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, aralkyl, aryl or aryloxy 
group, or R¹ or each R¹, together with the ring to which 
they are attached, represents an optionally substituted 
polycyclic hydrocarbyl group, R²represents a hydrogen atom or a C₁₋₄ alkyl group, R³represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group or an 
optionally substituted alkoxy or acyloxy group, R⁴ and R⁵each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an 
optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, 
cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, tricycloalkyl, 
alkoxyalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, haloaralkyl, a 
4- to 6- member heterocyclyl, tetrahydrofurfuryl or 
dioxolanyl group, or R⁴ and R⁵ together represent an 
optionally substituted, saturated or unsaturated carbon 
chain which may optionally contain one or more oxygen 
atoms and which may optionally be aryl- or cycloalkyl-fused, mrepresents zero or an integer from 1 to 6, and prepresents zero or an integer from 1 to 3. The invention especially relates to compounds of the 
general formula I in which any alkyl part of any of the 
groups R¹ to R⁵ contains up to 12 carbon atoms, preferably up 
to 10 carbon atoms,
