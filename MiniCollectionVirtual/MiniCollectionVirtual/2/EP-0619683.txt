<ABSTRACT>
First or second terminals can be connected to a communication installation and provide signalling information in the form of stimuli or messages which can be transmitted at times which can be defined by the terminal or which are transmitted to the communication installation when retrieved by the latter. For signalling-related communication with the second terminals, a terminal signalling arbiter A provided in the communication installation has a retrieval (inquiry, polling) device ABF for the cyclic retrieval of messages and a shift register memory SS for temporary storage of the messages, no more than one message being stored per terminal in each retrieval cycle. The messages temporarily stored in the shift register memory and the stimuli stored in stimulus memories for each cycle are removed by a low-priority arbitration program module under the control of an operating system.

<CLAIMS>
Program-controlled communications installation
for the optional connection of terminals, of which

first terminals provide signalling information in the
form of events which can be transmitted to the

communications installation at instants which can be
determined by the terminal, and of which second

terminals provide signalling information in the form of
messages which are communicated to the communications

installation upon call-up by the latter;

having a terminal signalling arbiter (A) for the
second terminals,


which has an interrogation device (ABF) for the
cycle-by-cycle call-up of messages, in such a way

that all the second terminals are successively
interrogated once per cycle, and
which has a shift memory (SS) for buffer-storing
messages, not more than one message being provided

for storage per terminal,
and also having a programmable digital processing
unit which is used for the central control of the

communications installation,

for which processing unit processing prescriptions
are provided, assigned to events and/or messages

which have been communicated or have been
triggered internally, and are stored in a system

memory (SSP) in the form of program modules
designated by the events and/or messages, and 
which processing unit has at least one system
processor (UP), to which the program modules can

be allocated for execution in a priority-controlled
manner under the control of an

operating system (BS), in which case the operating
system


can put a high-priority event protection program
module into execution readiness in the case of

arriving events,

which event protection program module is used to
record the events that have arrived in event

memories which are individually assigned to the
source of a respective event, and
by which event protection program module an
internal event can be triggered which causes the

operating system
to put a low-priority arbitration program module
into execution readiness,


which arbitration program module is used in each
case to read out the messages buffer-stored in the

shift memory per cycle and to remove a respective
event from the event memories, thereby causing the

operating system to put into execution readiness
the program module which is respectively

designated by a message and/or event and the
priority of which is arranged between that of the

event protection program module and that of the
arbitration program module.
Program-controlled communications installation
according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that
 the terminal signalling arbiter (A) has an
output shift memory (ASS), in which information can be

stored which is provided for outputting to second
terminals.
Program-controlled communications installation
according to Claim 2, 
characterized

in that
 the terminal signalling arbiter (A) can
transmit the information to the second terminals in

waiting phases of the interrogation device (ABF), which 
arise on account of a limited holding capacity of the

shift memory (SS).
