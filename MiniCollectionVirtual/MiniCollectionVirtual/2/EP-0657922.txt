<ABSTRACT>
For manufacturing a packaged semiconductor 
device, a lead frame (8) with an electrically insulating 

strip member (70) and a semiconductor chip (4) is placed 
in a molding unit having upper and lower dies (11a,11b). 

The upper and lower dies (11a,11b) have recessed areas (a,b) 
for determining a size of a cavity of the molding 

unit different from each other, the size of the cavity 
being measured in a direction perpendicular to a 

clamping motion direction of the dies (11a,11b). The lead frame (8) 
is positioned so that a surface of each lead (5) with the 

insulating strip (70) member applied thereto is contacted 
with one (11a) of the upper and lower dies having a 

larger recessed area and a molding line (ML) of the 
molding unit intersects the insulating strip member 

(70). The molding unit is closed to clamp the lead 
frame (8) to depress and thrust into spaces between adjacent 

leads that part of the strip member (70) which is outside the 
molding line and to form the cavity of the molding unit. 

By injecting a molding material into the cavity, a 
molding package (2) is provided encapsulating the 

semiconductor chip and a portion of each lead. The 
packaged semiconductor device (1) has a flanged side 

surface (S3) with an insulating strip (7) provided 
between a step (SS) of the flanged side surface and 

intermediate portions (Li) of the leads (5) which are 
between first portions (L1) of the leads encapsulated in 

the molding package (2) and second portions (L2) of the 
leads protruding from the flanged side surface. An 

insulating filler (7') is provided in spaces between 
those parts of the second portions of the leads which 

outwardly adjoin the intermediate portions of the leads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaged
semiconductor device and techniques for manufacturing
same and in particular to techniques useful when applied
to an LSI package having numerous pins or a small pin
arrangement pitch such as a QFP (Quad Flat Package).Dam bars are disposed in a lead frame used for
fabricating an LSI package. A dam bar is a member
disposed in an intermediate portion of each lead of the
lead frame so as to couple leads adjacent to each other
and has a function to prevent molten resin injected into
a molding unit from flowing out to the exterior of the
molding unit through spaces between different leads,
when a semiconductor chip mounted on the lead frame is
molded with resin. It has further a function to act as
a supporting member for preventing deformation of the
leads. The dam bars are cut away by means of a cutting
tool such as a press, etc., after the semiconductor chip
has been molded with resin.However, recently, for lead frames used for
fabricating LSI packages involving numerous pins, since
an increase in the number of pins or leads and a
decrease in the pin arrangement pitch are advanced
rapidly, it becomes more and more difficult to cut the
dam bars by means of a press. Therefore, in lieu of a lead frame in which
dam bars and leads are formed in one body from a metal
plate, so-called tape dam techniques have been proposed
(JP-A-58-28841, published on February 19, 1983) in which
a thin insulating tape is applied to a lead frame having
no dam bars, and the tape is pressed between different
leads in a resin molding operation to use the pressed
parts of the insulating tape as dam bars. According to
these tape dam techniques, since the tape is made of an
insulating material, dam cut after the resin molding is
unnecessary and thus it is possible to increase the
number of pins or leads and to decrease the pin
arrangement pitch.Techniques similar to the tape dam techniques
are disclosed also in U.S. Patent no. 5,525,547 issued on June 11,
1996, U.S. Patent No. 5,106,784 issued on April
21, 1992, and in JP-A-5-136310 published on June 1, 1993.JP-A-2-45961 published February 15, 1990 discloses a packaged
semiconductor device in which the molding package has
a stepped side surface, to protect the leads from stress.The present invention is based on knowledge of
the inventors thereof which will be described with
respect to Figs. 1 and 2. Therefore, the structures
themselves indicated in Figs. 1 and 2 are not known.
