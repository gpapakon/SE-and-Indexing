<ABSTRACT>
A multicolor liquid ink jet print head including a print 
head body containing liquid ink and having a nozzle 

assembly and electrical connections to the nozzle 
assembly. The print head body defines passageways to 

couple the ink from ink chambers (17-19) in the print 
head body to the nozzle assembly. The disclosed print 

head body contains three ink chambers for inks of three 
different colors, each of which is connected by a 

separate pathway in the print head body to a separate 
section of the nozzle assembly. The ink flow channels 

of the print head body are designed to assure total 
isolation of each color of ink from each of the other 

colors. The print head body includes sidewalls and a 
bottom, with the bottom of the print head body defining 

three exit ports (36-38) communicating with the nozzle 
assembly. One of the exit ports (37) communicates 

directly with an opening in the bottom of one of the ink 
chambers. Each of the other two exit ports communicates 

with a different crossflow channel (47,48) in the bottom 
of the print head body which in turn communicates with 

an opening (41,43) in the bottom of a different one of 
the ink chambers. The crossflow channels are formed in 

molding the print head body to extend to the exterior of 
the print head body, and each crossflow channel is 

sealed with a plug (56,57) to prevent leakage of ink 
from the crossflow channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ink jet print heads 
and more particularly concerns multicolor ink jet print 
heads in which the inks must be fed in isolation from 
one another to separate nozzles. In a monochrome ink jet print head, liquid ink is 
contained in the interior of a print head body, perhaps 
retained within a foam material. If the print head is 
arranged for operation so that the nozzle assembly is at 
the bottom of the print head, for example, an exit port 
is provided in the bottom of the print head body to 
allow ink to flow to the nozzle assembly. In the case 
of a thermal ink jet printer, the nozzle assembly 
includes a heater chip and nozzle plate which cooperate 
to form an ink supply area downstream of the exit port 
and channels running to individual nozzle openings for 
the emission of ink drops to effect printing. A multicolor ink jet print head contains a number of 
separate ink-containing chambers separated from one 
another by walls in a print head body. For example, a 
three color print head for cyan, magenta and yellow inks 
includes three separate ink chambers, each of which 
would typically include an individual foam element for 
the ink therein. It is an objective in multicolor print heads of this 
type to avoid any intermixing of the different colors of 
ink. In doing this, the ink flow design must 
accommodate close proximity of three separate exit ports 
from the print head body to three different sections or 
areas of a nozzle assembly. For reasons of nozzle 
assembly manufacture, it is preferred to have the three  
 
nozzle arrays for the three colors of ink closely 
adjacent one another using a single heater chip. In one known print head body fabrication technique, see e.g. EP-A-0 529 879, the 
bottom of the print head body is formed by ultrasonicly 
joining a plastic nose piece onto a plastic body part to 
form the bottom of the print head body. The various 
flow channels for the three colors of ink are formed 
cooperatively between the facing surfaces of the nose 
piece and the body. This type of assembly requires precise placement of the 
nose piece relative to the print head body and also runs 
the risk of leakage of ink at the ink flow 
passage-defining walls formed when the nose piece is 
bonded to the body part. It is a general objective of the present invention to 
provide a print head in which the print head body is 
more readily manufacturable and assures isolation of the 
different colors of ink. According to the invention there is provided an ink jet

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet print head body comprising sidewalls and 
a bottom defining an interior space, 

the bottom being formed in one piece with the sidewalls, an interior 
wall (14) dividing the interior space into first 

and second ink chambers (17,18), the bottom of the 
print head body being formed to define first and 

second ink exit ports (36,37), the bottom of the 
print head body being formed to also define a 

crossflow channel (47) communicating with the first 
ink exit port (36) and with an opening (41) in the 

bottom of the first ink chamber (17), the second 
exit port (37) communicating with an opening (42) 

in the bottom of the second ink chamber (18). 
The print head body of Claim 1 in which the 
crossflow channel (47) also communicates with the 

exterior of the print head body and further 
comprising a plug (56) in the crossflow channel 

sealing the channel from the exterior of the print 
head body. 
The print head body of Claim 1 or 2 which further 
comprises a second interior wall (16) defining a 

third ink chamber (19) and in which the bottom of 
the print head body further defines a second 

crossflow channel (48), a third ink exit port (38) 
and an opening (43) in the bottom of the third ink 

chamber, the second crossflow channel communicating 
with the opening in the bottom of the third ink 

chamber and with the third ink exit port. 
The print head body of Claim 3 in which the bottom 
of the print head body has a first portion (29) 

underlying the first, second and third ink chambers 
(17-19) and a second portion extending downwardly 

from the first portion, with the second portion of  
 

the bottom of the print head body including the 
first and second crossflow channels (47,48) and the 

first, second and third ink exit ports (36-38), 
with the openings (41,43) in the bottoms of the 

first and third ink chambers (17,19) extending 
generally downwardly from the ink chambers into 

communication with the first and second crossflow 
channels, respectively.
