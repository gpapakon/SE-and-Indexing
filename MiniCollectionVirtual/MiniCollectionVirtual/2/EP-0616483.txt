<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an electroacoustic transducer (1) having a diaphragm (5) and having a separating wall (24) lying behind the diaphragm (5), wall openings (25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, 30, 31, 32) which pass through the wall and are for making connections between a space (34) lying between the diaphragm (5) and one side (33) of the separating wall (24) and a space (36) lying on the other side (35) of the separating wall (24) being provided in this separating wall, and having a magnet system (16) arranged partly inside the space (36) lying on the other side (35) of the separating wall (24) and having a cover part (44) for rear covering of the space (36) lying on the other side (35) of the separating wall (24), the cover part (44) has a through-hole (45) with which the cover part (44) is put on an outer circumferential surface (46) of the magnet system (16) with acoustically sealed tolerance (no acoustically transmitting clearance).

An electroacoustic transducer (1) having a diaphragm (5) constructed to 
be capable of vibration parallel to a transducer axis (9), which transducer comprises a 

partition (24) facing the back (13) of the diaphragm, which partition substantially 
extends transversely of the transducer axis (9) and is traversed by at least one partition 

opening (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) to provide communication between a first 
space (34) situated between the diaphragm (5) and one side (33) of the partition (24) 

and a second space (36) situated at the other side (35) of the partition (24), the two 
spaces (34, 36) being partly bounded by a space-bounding part (3) of the transducer (1), 

and a magnet system (16) situated at least partly within the space (36) at the other side 
(35) of the partition (24) and having an outer circumferential surface (46) which extends 

in the direction of the transducer axis (9), and a closing member (44) arranged adjacent 
a portion (23) of the magnet system (16), which portion is remote from the partition 

(24), which closing member closes the space (36) situated at the other side (35) of the 
partition (24), characterized in that the closing member (44) has an opening (45) 

through which the portion (23) of the magnet system (16) remote from the partition (24) 
extends, in such a manner that an acoustically sealed fit of the closing member (44) on 

the outer circumferential surface (46) of the portion (23) of the magnet system (16) 
which is remote from the partition (24) is obtained, and the closing member (44) has a 

peripheral portion (47) surrounding the opening (45), by which the closing member (44) 
is connected to the space-bounding part (3) in an acoustically sealed and mechanically 

rigid manner. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the closing 
member (44) is connected to the outer circumferential surface (46) of the magnet system 

(16) only by means of a mechanical fit. 
A transducer as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the magnet 
system (16) is constituted by a pot-core magnet system having a circularly cylindrical 

outer circumferential surface (46), and the opening (45) of the closing member (44) is 
circular.
