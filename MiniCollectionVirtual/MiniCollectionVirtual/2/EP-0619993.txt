<ABSTRACT>
An improved phaco-surgical opthalmic lens nucleus 
fragmenting technique and instrument in which the nucleus 

fragmentation or "emulsification" is effected by the 
transverse back-and-forth rotary oscillation at ultrasonic 

frequencies and through a small angle, of a probe cutting 
needle or tip, while aspirating fragments through the 

hollow of the tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical implements and techniques, and more 
particularly such instruments and techniques as used in ophthalmic surgery. In certain ophthalmic techniques it is necessary to remove the nucleus and 
cortex of a lens. This technique is required most particularly for cataract 
operations. Currently the most advanced method of removal of the nucleus is by phaco-emulsification, 
(a technique disclosed in US Patent No 3,589,363 - Banko and 
Kelman, and also in Phaco-emulsification Surgery, Devine et al, Permagon 
Press, 1991, pages 1-5). 
US-A-3 589 363 discloses all the features of the preamble of claim 1. 
In this technique, a probe is used which comprises a 
hollow tip (needle) that is oscillated longitudinally by a transducer which is 
either a stack of metal plates (a magneto-strictive driver) or crystal  
 
(piezoelectric) or an acoustic vibrator (ultrasonic). A small incision is made in 
the cornea and the tip of the phaco-emulsifier is inserted through the incision 
into the capsular membrane which supports the cloudy lens. The tip is brought 
into contact with the nucleus and is oscillated at high acoustic and ultrasonic 
frequencies between 27 and 64 kHz with amplitude of between 50 and 60 
microns. The tip will break up the hard nucleus of the lens into tiny particles 
which can be sucked up or aspirated through the tip. This technique which is 
widely used is known as "small incision surgery" or "phaco surgery", and it 
enables saving the lens envelope or capsule, after the nucleus and surrounding 
cortex are removed, for the insertion of a plastic or other substitute or 
replacement lens. The technique does, however, have certain disadvantages. First, the 
longitudinal or normal hammering effect of the oscillating tip tends to move the 
nucleus away from the tip and in particular to push from the immediate vicinity 
of the tip the particles that are broken away from the nucleus. Thus a very 
strong vacuum (order of 100mm or more) is required both to hold the nucleus 
against the hammering tip and to suck such particles through the tip. Second, 
there is a danger that the tip itself or the particles broken up thereby may 
penetrate the capsule. This will cause complications during the operation as the 
jelly within the eye ball will tend to escape through an opening so made.  
 In accordance with the discovery underlying the present invention, by replacing 
the longitudinal normal hammering action with an oscillating lateral, arcuate or 
rotary cutting or fragmenting
