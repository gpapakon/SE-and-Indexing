<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a spacer rack for use in stacking wheel rims, the rack having several rim holders (2) made of plastic, each holder consisting of a circular spacer ring (3) and a positioning edge (5) extending upwards and downwards. Each rim holder (2) has an edge flange (6) which extends outwards beyond the positioning edge (5). Adjacent rim holders (2) are connected to each other by connectors (7) which overlap and are welded to the edge flanges (6).

<CLAIMS>
Spacing layer for stacking wheel rims, having several centring rings (2), each 
consisting of a spacer ring (3) and a centring rim (5) protruding upwards and 

downwards, several centring rings (2) lying in a common plane each being joined at their 
periphery to each other to form a lattice, characterized in that the spacer rings (3) are 

constructed in a circular shape and that the centring rings (2) are made of plastics. 
Spacing layer according to Claim 1, characterized in that the centring rings (2) 
have a flanged rim (6) projecting outwards over the centring rim (5) at several points on 

the periphery, at which rim they are joined to adjacent centring rings (2). 
Spacer layer according to Claim 2, characterized in that adjacent centring rings 
(2) are joined to each other by connecting pieces (7) overlapping the flanged rims (6). 
Spacer layer according to Claim 3, characterized in that the connecting pieces (7) 
are made of plastics and are welded to the centring rings (2). 
Spacer layer according to Claim 2, characterized in that the flanged rim (6) forms 
a hexagon and that all the centring rings (2) are joined to each other in a honeycomb-like 

arrangement to form a lattice. 
Spacer layer according to Claim 2, characterized in that the flanged rim (6) forms 
a square and that all the centring rings (2) are joined to each other in a rectangularly 

aligned arrangement to form a lattice. 
Spacer layer according to Claim 1, characterized in that several protective straps 
(9) extend inwards from the spacer layer ring (3). 
Spacer layer according to Claim 7, characterized in that the protective straps (9) 
are joined in each case flexibly to the spacer layer ring (3) via a foil hinge (10).
