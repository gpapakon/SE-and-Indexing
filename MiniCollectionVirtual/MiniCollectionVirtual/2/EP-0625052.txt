<ABSTRACT>
An expression vector for expressing a protein or polypeptide in a bacterium, which comprises a first DNA sequence encoding at least a secretion signal of a lipoprotein, and a second DNA sequence encoding a protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide heterologous to the bacterium which expresses the protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide. The bacterium expresses a fusion protein of a lipoprotein or lipoprotein segment and the protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide heterologous to the bacterium which expresses the protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide. Such expression vectors increase the immunogenicity of the protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide by enabling the protein or fragment thereof, or polypeptide or peptide to be expressed on the surface of the bacterium. Bacteria which may be transformed with the expression vector include mycobacteria such as BCG. The expression vectors of the present invention may be employed in the formation of live bacterial vaccines against Lyme disease wherein the bacteria express a surface protein of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BACTERIAL EXPRESSION VECTORS CONTAINING DNA ENCODING SECRETION SIGNALS OF LIPOPROTEINSThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 780, 261, filed October 21, 1991.This invention relates to expression vectors for expressing a protein in a bacterium, such as for example, a mycobacterium. More particularly, this invention relates to expression vectors for expressing and secreting proteins which are heterologous to the bacterium which expresses such proteins wherein such vectors further include DNA encoding at least the secretion signals of lipoproteins designed to achieve lipid acylation and surface expression of heterologous proteins.Certain mycobacteria represent major pathogens of man and animals. For example, tuberculosis is generally caused in humans by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and in cattle by Mycobacterium bpvis, which may also be transmitted to humans and other animals. Mycobacteria leprae is the causative agent of leprosy. M. tuberculosis and mycobacteria of the avium-intracellulare- scrofulaceum group (MAIS group) represent major opportunistic pathogens of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). M.pseudotuberculosis is a major pathogen of cattle.On the other hand, Bacille Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, an avirulent strain of M.bovis, is widely used in human vaccines, and in particular is used as a live vaccine, which is protective against tuberculosis. BCG is the only childhood vaccine which is currently given at birth, has a very low incidence of adverse effects, and can be used repeatedly in an individual. (eg., in multiple forms). In addition, BCG and other mycobacteria (eg., M. smegmatis) , employed in vaccines, have adjuvant properties among the best currently known and, therefore, stimulate a recipient's immune system to respond to antigens with great effectiveness. 

 It has been suggested by Jacobs, et. al, Nature, Vol. 327, No. 6122, pgs. 532-535 (June 11, 1987), that BCG could be used as a host for-the construction of recombinant vaccines. In other words, it was suggested to take an existing vaccine (in this case against tuberculosis) and expand its protective repertoire through the introduction of one or more genes from other pathogens.Transformation, the process whereby naked DNA is introduced into bacterial cells, has been carried out successfully in mycobacteria. Jacobs, et al (1987), as hereinabove cited, have described transformation of mycobacteria by electroporation. Electroportation can give from 10 to 10 transformants per μg of plasmid
