<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing a polymer 
predominating in terminal unsaturation by cationically polymerising 

a 1-olefin in the liquid phase at a temperature from -100 to +100°C 
in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising tin 

tetrachloride and a co-catalyst which is a source of cations and 
which is substantially free of organometallic compounds. The 

process is particularly suited to producing polybutenes having high 
vinylidene content which have high reactivity, especially towards 

forming maleic anhydride adducts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for cationic 
polymerisation of 1-olefins to an olefin polymer, and in particular 
to producing polyisobutenes which have a relative high degree of 
vinylidene groups. Isobutene is a typical example of a 1-olefin. Methods of 
polymerising 1-olefins, e.g. isobutenes whether pure or in an 
isomeric mixture as in a C₄ raffinate, using a Friedel-Crafts type 
catalyst are well-known. Typical of such catalysts are the halides 
of aluminium, iron, zinc, titanium, mercury and boron. These 
catalysts have also been used in conjunction with small amounts of 
co-catalysts such as water, alcohol, sulphur dioxide, carboxylic 
acids, mineral acids, ethers and alkyl halides to enhance catalyst 
activity. The reaction has been carried out in the liquid or 
gaseous phases, batchwise or continuously, at temperatures ranging 
from -100° to +100°C. It is also known that the polymerisation of 1-olefins e.g. 
isobutene using a Friedel-Crafts type catalyst is a cationic process 
which proceeds through formation of intermediate carbonium ions. The product of this reaction is generally a mixture of polymers 
which have the unsaturated linkage in the terminal or internal 
position within the polymer. Conventional cationic processes 
generally yield a polymer with a relatively high proportion of 
internal unsaturation compared with polymers having vinylidene 
groups. This is due to the "in situ" isomerisation of the 
unsaturated linkage to an internal position and is inherent in most  
 
cationic polymerisation processes. Internal unsaturation in olefin 
polymers is believed to be less desirable than terminal unsaturation 
of the vinylidene type because of the relatively lower chemical 
reactivity of internally unsaturated polymers when compared with 
polymers having vinylidene groups. This is especially true of the 
reactivity towards compounds such as maleic anhydride which forms an 
adduct with polyisobutene called polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride 
(PIBSA). These adducts are most valuable products and form the 
basis of the lubricating oil additives industry. Of the cationic polymerisation catalysts used hitherto those 
containing boron trifluoride are known for their tendency to 
isomerise the unsaturation in the polymer product to an unreactive 
internal position. For instance, Puskas, I. et al in Journal of 
Polymer Science, Symposium No. 56. pp 191-202 (1976) have reviewed 
the relative effects of catalysts such as boron trifluoride and 
complexes thereof with co-catalysts such
