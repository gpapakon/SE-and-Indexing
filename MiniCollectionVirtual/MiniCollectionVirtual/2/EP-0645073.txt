<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an electrode
structure for electroluminescent displays.Electroluminescent display panels (ELDs) offer
several advantages over older display technologies such as
cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and liquid crystal displays
(LCDs). Compared with CRTs, ELDs require less power,
provide a larger viewing angle, and are much thinner.
Compared with LCDs, ELDs have a larger viewing angle,
brighter display, do not require auxiliary lighting, and
can have a larger display area.Fig. 1 shows a typical prior art ELD. The ELD has a
glass panel 2, a plurality of transparent electrodes 4,
a first layer of a dielectric 16, a phosphor layer 18, a
second dielectric layer 20, and a plurality of metal
electrodes 22 perpendicular to the transparent electrodes
4. The transparent electrodes 4 are typically indium-tin
oxide (ITO) and the metal electrodes 22 are typically Al.
The dielectric layers 16, 20 act as capacitors to protect
the phosphor layer 18 from excessive currents. When an
electrical potential, such as about 200 V, is applied
between the transparent electrodes 4 and the metal
electrodes 22, electrons tunnel from one of the interfaces
between the dielectric layers 16, 20 and the phosphor 
layer 18 into the phosphor layer where they are rapidly
accelerated. The phosphor layer 18 typically comprises ZnS
doped with Mn. Electrons entering the phosphor layer 18
excite the Mn and the Mn emits photons. The photons pass
through the first dielectric layer 16, the transparent
electrodes 4, and the glass panel 2 to form a visible
image.Although current ELDs are satisfactory for some applications,
more advanced applications require brighter displays,
larger displays, or smaller displays. These applications
require electrodes with lower resistances than
available in current ELDs. The limiting factor in current
ELDs is the high resistance, about 10 ohms/square (Ω/▪), of
transparent electrodes made from ITO. Therefore, what is
needed in the industry are lower resistance transparent
electrodes for ELDs.In Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol 13, No.386, E-812, abstract
of JP-A-1 134895, 26.05.89, the provision of a metal
assist structure is disclosed which is formed over a portion
of the transparent electrode of an ELD and arranged
such that it is in electrical contact with the transparent
electrode.The present invention consists in an electroluminescent
display, comprising : a substrate with a transparent electrode
thereon, and a metal assist structure formed over a
portion of the transparent electrode and
