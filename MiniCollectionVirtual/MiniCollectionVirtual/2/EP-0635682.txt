<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boiler of the so-called 
combined type comprising a first gas-water heat 
exchanger for producing primary hot water for space heating, 
a primary water piping circuit (5) for circulation of said 
water extending between a respective inlet and outlet 
openings of the boiler, a second water-water heat exchanger 
for producing hot sanitary water, as well as valve means for 
diverting selectively said primary hot water to said second 
water-water heat exchanger or to said outlet opening. In the following description and claims, by the term 
boiler of the so-called combined type, is meant a boiler 
capable of delivering either hot water for space heating or 
primary water, or hot water for sanitary use. As is known, in the household boiler industry and in 
particular in the field of the so-called combined type 
boilers, one of the most difficult problems to solve is that 
of ensuring delivery of hot sanitary water at the desired 
temperature regardless of the amount of the withdrawal 
thereof. This problem is especially felt when the boiler is of 
the combined type with instantaneous production of sanitary 
water: indeed, if the thermal power of the burner is designed 
for small withdrawals, the boiler is not able to meet the 
large ones, while if designed for large withdrawals, the 
boiler loses considerably its efficiency and is not able to 
hold steady the temperature of the hot sanitary water (so-called 
"hunting"). In order to attenuate in some manner the negative 
effects of these phenomena, there have been proposed in the 
art the so-called accumulation boilers, in which a certain 
quantity of sanitary water ready for use is stored in a tank  
 
provided in the boiler body. Although basically meeting the purpose, the 
accumulation boilers developed in the art exhibit a series of 
shortcomings not easy to eliminate. A first shortcoming is correlated with the fact that, 
differently from boilers with instantaneous production of 
sanitary water, the accumulation boilers do not allow easy 
temperature control of the hot sanitary water, which can be 
achieved by varying the temperature of the water stored in 
the accumulation tank and, optionally, by mixing the latter 
with the cold water coming from the water mains. If on the one hand the thermal inertia of the 
accumulated sanitary water does not allow a rapid adaptation 
to the desired temperature in the absence of mixing, on the 
other hand an effective mixing of hot and cold water can be 
achieved only by providing
