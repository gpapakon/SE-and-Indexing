<ABSTRACT>
In this process, copper tube blanks hot-formed from cast rods are first cold-formed by drawing to an intermediate dimension. The internal surfaces of these intermediate tubes are then roughened and these roughened intermediate tubes are then heat treated at a temperature of from 350 DEG C to 650 DEG C while passing oxygen-containing protective gas into the interior of the tube. The intermediate tubes are then subjected to a medium hard/hard hardening drawing followed by a thermal treatment at a temperature of from 175 DEG C to 275 DEG C while passing an oxygen-containing gas mixture into the tube interior. This manufacturing process substantially reduces the copper ion release of hard/medium hard fitting tubes in the form of straight lengths of SF-Cu used for mains drinking water supply while retaining the same resistance to pit corrosion. The maximum copper ion solubility is about 1 mg/l for drinking water having a pH in the range from 6.5 to 9.0.

Method for manufacturing seamless drawn semi-hard/hard
installation pipes made of copper, whereby the

internal surfaces of the pipes are roughened,
characterised in that firstly pipe blanks hot-formed from

cast bars are cold-formed by drawing to an intermediate
size, whereupon the internal surfaces of these

intermediate pipes are roughened and then these roughened
intermediate pipes are annealed at a temperature of 350°C

to 650°C during which an inert gas containing oxygen is
introduced into the inside of the pipe, and in that after

this the intermediate pipes are subjected to a semi-hard/hard
hardening pass which is followed by a thermal

treatment with a temperature of 175°C to 275°C during
which a gas mixture containing oxygen is introduced into

the inside of the pipe.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the internal surfaces of the intermediate pipes are

roughened by blasting or pickling.
Method according to patent claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the annealing operation is carried

out with an inert gas atmosphere with an oxygen content
of 1% to 7% inside the pipe.
Method according to one of patent claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the annealing operation is carried

out at a temperature of approximately 650°C.
Method according to one of patent claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the thermal treatment taking place 

after the hardening pass is carried out at a temperature
of approximately 250°C.
Method according to one of patent claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that after the hardening pass the

internal surface of the pipes is degreased.
Method according to one of patent claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that a gas mixture with at least 20%

oxygen is used for the thermal treatment of the pipes
after the hardening pass.
Method according to one of patent claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the heating for the thermal

treatment is carried out by convection, electrical
induction or by conduction.
