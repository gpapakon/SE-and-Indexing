<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyphenylene ether
containing reactive end groups, to the process for its preparation,
and to the relevant polymeric compositions.More in particular, the present invention relates to a
polyphenylene ether containing reactive end groups of ether
type, to the process for its preparation and to the relevant
polymeric compositions.The polyphenylene ether resins (PPE), also known as
polyphenylene oxide resins, represent a well known family of
engineering polymers, characterized by excellent and balanced
physical-mechanical properties such as hydrolytic stability,
dimensional stability, tenacity, thermal resistance and dielectrical
properties.This combination of properties makes the polyphenylene
ether resins suitable for use in a variety of applications by
means of injection or extrusion molding techniques.In spite of these numerous possible commercial applications
of the polyphenylene ether resins, their utilization is
limited due to their poor processability mainly attributable
to the low fluidity in the molten state and to the narrow
range of workability which can cause some difficulties during
the extrusion and injection molding operations. A further drawback is that the polyphenylene ether resins
show a poor solvent resistance after molding and a low
resilience (IZOD),so that the use for certain applications
is further limited. In fact, it is known that these resins
swell or are soluble in acetone, toluene, halogenated
hydrocarbons and the like. For this reason they cannot be
used for those parts which may come into contact with an
organic solvent.On the other hand, it is known that the polyamides are
engineering polymers having good properties of resistance to
organic solvents, while they are lacking many other properties.
It is known, in fact, that the polyamides such as,
for example, Nylon 6 or 66, have a high moisture absorption,
a minor water resistance, a minor dimensional stability and a
low heat deformation temperature.For these reasons, polyphenylene ether and polyamide
resins are very different from each other and it may be expected
that a polymeric alloy obtained by the combination of these
two resins have interesting properties since the lacking properties
of one of the resins could be compensated by the properties
of the other resin.Japanese Patent Publication No. 997/1970 proposes a
polymeric composition consisting of a polyphenylene ether and
a polyamide for the purpose of improving the fluidability of
the polyphenylene ether. However, owing to the
