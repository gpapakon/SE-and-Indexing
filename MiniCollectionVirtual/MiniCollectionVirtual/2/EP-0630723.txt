<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are disclosed for controlling 
the motion of a machine system so as to cut individual lengths 

from a web having graphics on predetermined web positions and 
which allows the use of an inexpensive AC induction motor. An 

AC induction motor 
(42)
 has an output power shaft for imparting 
the motive force necessary to drive the machine system, such as 

a web feeding system. A sensor 
(29)
 is operatively coupled to 
the AC motor for determining the position of the motor during 

system operation. A controller 
(26)
 is operatively connected to 
the sensor and motor and forms a closed loop control circuit. 

The controller changes the feedback loop characteristics of the 
closed loop control circuit during a stop, hold or start 

condition of the motor. By adding an externally generated 
compensating signal to the input of the feedback loop, the 

controller also minimizes acceleration error. The controller 
also limits the value of a signal reaching the feedback loop of 

the control circuit to a given maximum value so as to eliminate 
any over-reaction of the system, while allowing a signal having 

less than a given threshold value to proceed unaffected to the 
feedback loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for 
controlling the motion of a machine system, and more particularly 
to controlling the motion of a machine system so as to cut 
individual lengths from a web having graphics on predetermined 
web positions and which allows the use of an inexpensive AC 
induction motor in a demanding servo application. High speed labeling of containers requires accurate 
feeding of a web of film material into a cutting mechanism where 
the web of film is cut into labels which are subsequently applied 
onto containers. In many labeling apparatus, the web is fed onto 
a cutting drum where the web aligns with a cut point defined by 
the drum for cutting the web into labels. The cut labels are 
then transferred to a label transport drum where the label moves 
into a container wrapping position to engage a container for wrap 
around labeling. During web feeding, it is essential that the web 
graphics align with predetermined positions along the path of 
travel so that the web is cut along areas defined by the web 
graphics to form cut labels. Typically, close control of web 
feed is maintained by the use of expensive differential 
transmissions which drive web engaging feed rolls. The position 
of the cutting drum or label transport drum are known throughout 
the labeling cycle by encoders operatively connected to a 
controller. The graphics on the web are sensed during web 
feeding and the transmissions are adjusted as necessary to ensure 
web feed cutting so that the labels are cut properly. Expensive 
servomotors have also been employed for web control in labeling 
machines. Both differential transmissions and servomotors are 
expensive and it would be more desirable to use inexpensive AC 
induction motors for driving feed rollers. However, the AC 
induction motors have slower reaction time than servo motors, and  
 
therefore, up until the present invention, servomotors were used 
because of the rapidly changing feed speeds during production. 
Additionally, the acceleration error in closed loop control 
systems heretofore made use of even servo motors less than 
optimum, making the use of AC induction motors even less 
desirable. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an apparatus and method for controlling the motion of a 
machine system by using an inexpensive AC induction motor in an 
application that ordinarily would require an expensive servo 
motor and controller. It is another object to provide an apparatus and method 
for eliminating or
