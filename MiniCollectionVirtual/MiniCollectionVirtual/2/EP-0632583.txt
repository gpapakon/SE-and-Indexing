<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-stable variable gain amplifier comprising a 
differential input stage (Q1,Q2) coupled to a first 

terminal (+Vc) of a voltage supply generator and to a 
second terminal (GND) of the voltage supply generator 

through first (M1) and second (M2) field-effect transistors 
whose gate terminals are connected into a first common 

control terminal (VG1). 
Connected to the differential stage are two bipolar 
transistors (Q3,Q4) which are also connected between the 

first terminal (+Vc), through two resistors (R3,R4), and 
the second (GND) of the voltage supply generator, through 

third (M3) and fourth (M4) field-effect transistors. 
The third and fourth transistors have gate terminals 
connected into a second common control terminal (VG2). The 

collector terminals of the bipolar transistors form output 
terminals (OUT+,OUT-) for the amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable gain amplifiers (VGA), 
and in particular to a VGA whose gain is dependent 
essentially on a control voltage and can be temperature 
stabilized. In many applications -- e.g. automatic gain control (AGC) 
systems in audio and TV apparatus -- the signals whose 
amplitudes may vary within a wide range need to be 
amplified so that an amplified signal with constant 
amplitude can be presented at the output. In such automatic gain controls as usually comprise at 
least one variable gain amplifier in a loop structure, a 
signal level detector, a control current generator driven 
by the signal level detector, and a stabilizing capacitor, 
it is indeed the variable gain amplifier that constitutes 
the most critical part of the arrangement. For a truly effective control of the gain, the dependence 
of the variable gain amplifier gain on control voltage 
should follow an exponential law and this dependence should 
remain stable as temperature varies. The most widely used arrangement in the art for 
implementing a variable gain amplifier is to cut down the 
gain of a balanced stage using a Gilbert multiplier in the 
manner shown in Figure 1. Such a variable gain amplifier is disclosed in patent document US-A-3 684 974. The signal to be amplified is applied to the input 
terminals of a differential stage which includes 
transistors Q1 and Q2. On the contrary, a control voltage Vc is applied to the 
input terminals of two differential structures Q3, Q4 and 
Q5, Q6 of a Gilbert multiplier, connected to the legs of 
the differential stage. Such control voltage determines the  
 
amplification gain of the signal that appears at the output 
terminals formed by one of the leg pair of each of the two 
differential structures. The problems brought about by this prior approach are the 
following: 
the gain dependence on the control voltage is not 
exponential but rather of the "hyperbolic tangent" type, 
and the noise introduced by the multiplying cell is high, and 
a common output mode adjusting circuit must be used.  In order to obtain an exponential type dependence from the 
control voltage for the amplifier gain, a complicated 
distortion of said control signal must be resorted, so that 
said exponential type dependence is difficult to stabilize 
versus temperature changes. Another known method to the skilled men for providing a 
variable gain amplifier is to use as gain control a field-effect 
transistor acting as a variable resistor, as shown 
in Figure 2. In such a case, the gain
