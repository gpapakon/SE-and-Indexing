<ABSTRACT>
Iron carbide (Fe3C) is produced from granulated sponge iron which has a maximum carbon content of 2 wt. % and is supplied from an iron ore reducing plant. The sponge iron is swirled with a gas containing carbon and a maximum 1.5 vol. % water in a fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 500 to 800  DEG C. A product is extracted from the reactor. The total iron content of said product is fixed at a minimum of 80 wt. % Fe3C. Preferably, methane or a gas containing methane is fed into the fluidized bed reactor as a gas containing carbon. A waste gas can be extracted from the top area of the fluidized bed reactor and hydrogen can be separated therefrom and at least partially directed into the reducing plant.

A process of producing iron carbide (FE
3
C) from granular sponge iron,
which with a carbon content of not more that 1 wt-% comes from an iron-ore

reduction plant in which it is treated in a fluidized bed as last reductions stage by
supplying reduction gas at temperatures in the range from 500 to 800°C, where

the reduction gas contains at least 90 vol-% hydrogen (calculated nitrogen-free),
where the granular sponge iron is conducted through a carburisation stage and

fluidized therein at temperatures in the range from 500 to 800°C with a gas
including methane, where the water content of the gas is not more than 1,5 vol- %, and where a product is withdrawn from the carburization step whose total

iron content is bound as FE
3
C for at least 80 wt-%, wherein the carburization
stage is formed as a circulating fluidized bed, comprising a fluidized bed reactor

(11), a separator (12) connected with the upper portion of the reactor for
separating solids and a solids return line (17), wherein the solids return line

connects the separator with the lower portion of the reactor, wherein per hour at
least five times the weight of solids, as compared to the solids content in the

reactor (11), is recirculated from the separator into the reactor, and wherein the
iron sponge is fluidized in the fluidized bed reactor at temperatures of 500 to

800°C with the gas including methane as fluidizing gas.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 from the upper
portion of the reactor an exhaust gas including solids is supplied to the

separator (12) and from the separator an exhaust gas (20) with an H
2
 content of
10 to 40 vol-%, calculated water-free is withdrawn, that from the hydrogen

containing exhaust gas hydrogen is separated and this hydrogen at least
partially is conducted into the reduction plant, and that methane is added to the

exhaust gas and that the exhaust gas is recirculated into the fluidized bed
reactor. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the pressure in
the fluidized bed reactor is 3 to 10 bar.
