<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid actuator for a fluid flow valve comprises a closure member (64) adapted to engage a fluid flow orifice (16), and includes a magnetic plunger (46) under the control of a solenoid, for moving the closure member (64) into or out of engagement with the orifice (16). To assist the opening of the valve, a diaphragm spring (66) aids the downward force upon plunger (46) at changeover, being deflected during the upward stroke of plunger (46) and held deflected until changeover. The solenoid plunger (46) is stable at either end of its travel to maintain the selected state of the valve, change of state to open or close orifice (16) being by means of a magnetic pulse generated by selenoid coil (43), the plunger (46) being latched at closure by permanent magnets (32, 34). The diaphragm spring (66) may form part of an assembly (62) including a membrane switch (70), responsive to the state of the valve, the assembly (62) fitting into the body of the closure member (64). Alternatively a reed switch responsive to magnetic flux may provide valve status indication. The use of a diaphragm spring to assist in valve opening, enables provision of an axially more compact, and electromagnetically more efficient actuator, able with appropriate intrinsic safety protection, to be enclosed within a gas meter housing to control an incoming gas supply under control of electronic switching circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to solenoid actuators, and
more particularly to solenoid actuators used for fluid flow
control.Solenoid actuators of the type in question are well known
in fluid flow control, where an orifice or aperture in a
fluid flow path is to be opened or closed by means of a
closure member such as a seal, plug, or the like, under the
control of an electric current.Such actuators commonly comprise a magnetic circuit wound
about by a flux-generating coil, with a plunger of magnetic
material moving under the influence of the flux in the
magnetic circuit, in response to current flow through the
coil. The plunger is mechanically coupled to the closure
means which opens or closes the aperture or orifice in the
fluid flow path as the plunger moves within the magnetic
circuit.Such actuators may incorporate a diaphragm spring or
springs, to provide an axial force, along the principal
axis of the plunger, additional to that which would be
exerted upon the plunger by the solenoid alone, to assist
in opening or closing of the aperture or orifice, and/or to
bias the valve to an open or closed position. The diaphragm
springs may also serve the purpose of centring the valve
assembly.Such constructions are known, for example, from GB-A-2140129 
and DE-A-2303450.Actuators of the type in question have most usually been
designed and constructed as an integral part of the fluid
flow systems in which they have been employed, thereby
giving rise to assemblies of considerable cost and
complexity.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved solenoid actuator for use in fluid flow control
applications in which the disadvantages of such prior art
actuators are substantially reduced.According to the present invention there is provided a
solenoid actuator comprising a closure member adapted to
move to engage a fluid flow aperture or orifice; solenoid
means having a solenoid plunger for moving the closure member into or out of
engagement with the aperture or orifice; a magnetic circuit which forms part of the solenoid means; and an assembly
comprising at least one diaphragm spring capable of
exerting a force counter to the force exerted by the
solenoid means; characterised in that the closure member is
mounted on the assembly, the diaphragm spring is
deformable in the direction of travel of the solenoid
plunger when the closure member has contacted the fluid
flow aperture or orifice, thereby to convey to the closure member, and
to limit, the force exerted upon the closure member by the
soleno
