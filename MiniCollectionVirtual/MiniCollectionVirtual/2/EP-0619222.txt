<ABSTRACT>
A rectangular-shaped self-standing liquefied gas storage 
tank carried in a low temperature liquefied gas carrier ship 

is disclosed. The tank is of an approximate box-shape having 
a bottom plate section, front and rear sections, two side 

wall sections, and a roof plate section. The carrier ship 
has bulkheads inside thereof, formed along the direction of 

the width of the carrier ship, to define holds for each of 
the tanks. The tank has reducing sections between the roof 

plate section and the lateral wall sections, which are 
directed toward the inner side of the tank and extend 

upwardly. Lateral movement restraining members are provided 
between the front wall section of the tank and one of the 

bulkheads of the carrier ship, and between the rear wall 
section of the tank and another bulkhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements of a self-standing
liquefied gas storage tank for a low temperature
liquefied gas carrier ship which transports low temperature
liquefied gas such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or the like, and of a liquefied
gas carrier ship having these tanks.Various types of low temperature liquefied gas carrier
ships which transport low temperature liquefied gas such as
LNG or LPG have been used. Some of these use self-standing
liquefied gas storage tanks for transporting low temperature
liquefied gas, and examples of these carriers are disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. 2-249796,
Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. 4-8999,
and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No.
4-92794.An example of this carrier ship is shown in Fig. 12.
This liquefied gas carrier ship may easily have a flat deck 5
and makes it possible to increase the storage capacity of the
liquid by forming liquefied gas storage tanks 4 carried in a
ship's hull 1 into rectangular shapes. Furthermore, it is
contemplated, as shown in Fig. 13, to adopt a double casing
structure (armored-structure) having an outer shell 1A and an
inner shell 1B in the ship's hull 1 in order to ensure
safety.For such a low temperature liquefied gas carrier ship 
having rectangular-shaped self-standing tanks, it is
contemplated, as shown in an example in cross-sectional view
in Figs. 13 and 14, to mount the rectangular-shaped tank 4 to
a ship's bottom 2 of the ship's hull 1, in a self-standing
state, by a plurality of supporting devices 3. The tank 4 is
constructed of alloy sheets such as aluminum alloy sheets.
In Fig. 14, chain lines show that the tank 4 may contract, as
indicated by continuous lines, when the tank 4 is filled with
low temperature liquefied gas, and thus, the supporting
devices 3 allow the contraction of the tank 4.The portion above the tank 4 is covered by a deck 5, and
the tank 4 is prevented from moving laterally by stops 6
provided between an under surface of the deck 5 and an upper
surface of the tank 4.However, the above structure requires the depth D of the
ship's hull 1 to be increased, and this causes the weight of
the ship and the amount of labor required to build the ship
to increase. Furthermore, it is necessary to reinforce the
deck 5 in order to restrain the lateral movement of the
rectangular-shaped self-standing tanks 4. Additionally,
since the upper surface of the ship's hull 1 is constituted
by a single unitary
