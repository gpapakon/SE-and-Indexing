<ABSTRACT>
In an FM radio receiver, in addition to automatic 
tuning to a station to be received. a sound field and tone 

control are performed in real time by utilizing RDS (radio 
data system) data multiplexed with a broadcast signal. An 

RDS signal detection section 14 detects RDS signal supplied 
from an FM detector 7 and the detected RDS signal is decoded 

by an RDS decoder 15 to reproduce the RDS data indicative of 
type of a broadcasting program content (for instance. PTY: 

program type; M/S: music/speech). A ROM 21 of a microcomputer 
circuit 13 preliminary stores control data prepared 

correspondingly with the RDS data to be decoded and a CPU 22 
outputs the control data and controls equalizer circuits 9L 

and 9R and tone control circuits 10L and 10R in response to 
the decoded RDS data so that sound field and tone optimal to 

the broadcast program content is obtained as an audio output 
of the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sound field and tone 
control device for an FM radio receiver and, particularly, 
to a device which is suitable for use in an FM radio 
receiver in which a selection of broadcasting station and 
display of RDS (radio data system) data are performed by 
using RDS data multiplexed with an FM signal to provide it 
with a function of automatically setting an optimum sound 
field and tone correspondingly to a code contained in the 
RDS data and indicating a content thereof such as broadcasting 
programs, etc. In a recent FM radio broadcasting, implementation of 
the RDS system is making a progress, in which an FM stereo 
signal multiplexed with various digital data is transmitted. 
Such digital data include an auto tuning data which enable 
the receiver to select automatically from stations broadcasting 
an identical program, a specific station which 
provides the best reception to the receiver, and traffic 
information identification data, etc. Major specifications 
of such RDS system have been finalized in the European 
Broadcasting Union (EBU).  Further, it has been known that such system is already 
employed not only in Europe but also in the United States, 
Hong Kong and the Union of South Africa, etc. The RDS system was developed as a broadcasting system 
for mainly car radio use. That is, in a case where a car is 
travelling for a long distance trip while receiving an FM 
broadcasting, a receiver's tuning frequency set to a certain 
broadcasting station (first station) needs to be retuned 
manually to a new station (second station) which is broadcasting 
the same program as the car goes out of service area 
of the first station and entering into that of the second 
station. However, it is possible to avoid such inconveniences 
by making a car radio having a more sophisticated 
automatic tuning function by receiving an automatic tuning 
code included in the RDS data broadcast through a network of 
FM stations covering areas through which the car travels. Having such automatic tuning function on receivers is 
particularly demanded by FM stations whose service area is 
relatively small. Further, since it is possible to multiplex 
other information service with the main FM broadcasting for 
transmission, an FM system multiplexed with additional data 
is considered to be adopted more widely in the near future. In view of the purposes mentioned above, EBU adopted 
and defined the RDS system as to satisfy the following 
conditions: 
(1) With ease of tuning operation of a
