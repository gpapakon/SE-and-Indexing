<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for making fatigue-free external 
connections to a device (4,5) mounted on a direct copper bonded 

substrate, in which one or more connector tubes (6) are brazed to 
respective copper areas (2) on the substrate before the device (4,5) is 

mounted on the substrate, and external connections are made by 
soldering leads (8) or bus bars (9) into the tubes (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mounting arrangements for 
semiconductor devices. In particular although not exclusively the 
invention is concerned with a mounting arrangement, or package, for 
an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Present mounting arrangements for IGBTs utilise a direct 
copper bonded (DCB) alumina substrate, which forms the base of the 
package as well as providing internal isolation. Other 
semiconductor devices and/or passive components may be mounted on 
the substrate, and the component-bearing, or populated, side of the 
substrate may be enclosed in a case and encapsulated with any of a 
variety of potting compounds. Several methods are used for attaching connecting wires or 
bus-bars to copper areas on the substrate, which then make terminals 
on the outside of the package or module for the end user, one of 
which methods is to solder the wires or bus-bars directly to the 
copper area on the populated side of the substrate. With this 
method components can be mounted on the substrate and the 
sub-assembly completed before space-restricting external connections 
are made, which can be essential if space is limited, as is often 
the case with this kind of structure. A problem which arises with such soldered joints is that  
 
the thermal expansion rate of the copper layer which forms part of 
the DCB "sandwich" is modified by the bond to the alumina, and is 
lower than that of free copper. A copper conductor soldered to the 
copper layer tends to expand and contract at its normal rate, and 
this results in fatigue and eventual failure of the solder joint. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved electrical connection to a conductive area on a substrate. According to one aspect of the present invention a mounting 
arrangement for one or more semiconductor devices comprises a 
substrate of electrically insulating material having directly bonded 
thereon at least one area of electrically conducting material to 
which a semiconductor device is to be connected, said area of 
electrically conductive material having brazed thereon an 
electrically conductive connector member to which an external 
electrical connection may be soldered. According to another aspect of the present invention a 
method of making an electrical connection to a generally laminar 
conductor formed on a substrate of electrically insulating material, 
on which substrate one or more semiconductor devices are to be 
mounted, includes the steps of brazing onto said laminar conductor
