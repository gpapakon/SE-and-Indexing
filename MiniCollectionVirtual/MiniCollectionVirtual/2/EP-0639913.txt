<ABSTRACT>
Modulation schemes requiring fully coherent demodulation 
usually includes some form of known transmission or pilot 

transmission to resolve the phase ambiguity which would be 
inevitable in any form of demodulation which relies on the data 

transmission allowed for demodulation. When the transmission of 
phase shift keying information is used without any pilot 

component and use of decision directed carrier recovery for 
demodulation is supplied then error control coding may be used to 

resolve the inherent phase ambiguities. The source data is 
augmented with a suitable checksum, ie one that does not show 

correct data for all bits inverted prior to protection with a forward 
error correction code and modulation. The demodulated data is 

error corrected and the checksum tried. If this checks out then 
the data is accepted as correct. Otherwise the demodulated data is 

inverted and the process repeated. If this fails blocks of 
demodulated data may be inverted around points corresponding 

to troughs in the energy of the decision derived reference. The 
technique allows coherent demodulation of phase shift keying 

without any pilot transmission resulting in very good signal to 
noise ratio performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for use in equipment
providing a digital radio link between a fixed and a mobile radio unit.Equipment for providing such a radio link is described in
GB-A-2 276 064 (corresponding to GB Patent Application Number
9304901.3). This application describes the use of Wiener-like filters for
providing good estimates of the amplitude of the inphase I, the quadrature
phase Q, components of, for example, the spread spectrum pilot signal.In general, modulation schemes requiring fully coherent demodulation
must include some form of known transmission or a pilot transmission. This
is because of the phase ambiguity which is inevitable in any form of
demodulation which relies on the data transmission alone for demodulation.
In such schemes the pilot content of the transmitted signal includes a certain
amount of additional energy.It would be advantageous if a scheme was available which reduced the
additional energy to a minimum.A scheme of this kind is known from US-A-3 806 647.An object of the present invention is to provide a method providing a
digital radio link between a fixed and a mobile radio unit in which the
additional energy included in the pilot content of a transmitted signal is
reduced to a minimum. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of
minimising additional energy in a pilot of a transmitted signal in apparatus for
use in equipment providing a digital radio link between a fixed and a mobile
radio unit, the method comprising the steps of: a) receiving an error correction
coded signal frame; b) demodulating data in the error correction coded signal
frame; c) decoding the demodulated data; d) checking the decoded data for
errors; e) if errors are present, inverting the demodulated data and repeating
steps c) and d); characterised by f) if errors are still present, determining a profile of signal
energy over the frame; g) identifying points of low signal energy over the
frame; h) inverting the demodulated data at points corresponding to positions
of minimum signal energy; and i) repeating steps c) to e) for each inversion.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with
reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein;
FIGURE 1 shows a block diagram of a differential binary phase shift
keying receiver using decision directed Wiener filter demodulation; FIGURE 2 shows a receiver, having a double-pass decision direct
demodulator; andFIGURE 3 shows a block diagram of the circuitry which may be used
to carry out the invention in
