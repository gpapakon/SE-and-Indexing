<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a vibration welding apparatus (10) with a vibration welding head (110) that has a solid, long extended housing (112), on one face of which is mounted a drive motor (116) and in front of whose other face a vibration head (124) that can be tipped with the retainer for the component to be bonded is held by means of at least two long extended leaf springs (126a, 126b), the ends of which are attached on opposite sides of the vibration head (124) and near the end of the housing (112) facing the drive motor. The driven shaft (118) of the drive motor (116) is connected, via a connecting shaft (122) running through the housing (112), with an eccentric drive running in front of the face of the housing away from the motor and into the interior of the vibration head (124). A feed unit that guides and advances in the housing either the vibration welding head or the retainer that holds the component rigid during the welding operation serves to advance the vibration welding head (110) or the indicated retainer in the bonding direction after plastification of the components to be bonded in the area plastified by the frictional heat.
