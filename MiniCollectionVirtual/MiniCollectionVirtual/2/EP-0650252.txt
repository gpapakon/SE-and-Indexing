In an oscillating driving circuit (105), a phase control and an amplification 
process are carried out, and a drive signal is input into a second electrode pattern (103b) 

which shortcircuited by a second leading means (104b) in response to a detection signal 
from a first electrode pattern (103a) shortcircuited by a first leading means (104a). In 

response to this drive signal, vibrating waves are oscillated in the vibrating member 
(101) and the piezoelectric element (102) and rotational movement is produced in a 

moving member (108). Moving member (108) is arranged in such a manner that it is in 
contact with the vibrating member (101) via a projection (107) formed on the v

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic motor and an electronic apparatus
employing the ultrasonic motor for friction-driving a moving member by way of
vibrating waves produced by utilizing the stretching movement of a piezoelectric
element.Conventionally, with such an ultrasonic motor, a predetermined high frequency
voltage is applied to the piezoelectric element fixed on the vibrating member to produce
travelling waves. The moving member attached in contact with the vibrating member
under predetermined pressure is driven by the travelling waves.Such a conventional structure is disclosed in, for instance, Japanese Laid-open
patent application No. 58-148,682.In Figure 18 of the accompanying drawings, there is shown a cross-sectional
view
of the conventional analog type electronic timepiece. The stator 53 is arranged on the
upper plane of the ground plate 40, and a magnetic core 52 is positioned in contact with
the upper plane of this stator 53 and then is screwed thereon. The coil wire 51a is
wound on the magnetic core 52 and is connected to the driving control circuit (not
shown).The rotor 54 is rotatably associated with the rotor hole 53a of the stator 53. The
rotation of the rotor 54 is transported to the fifth wheel 55, the fourth wheel 44, the third
wheel 43, the minute wheel 42, the rear wheel of data (not shown), and the hour wheel
45.When a predetermined voltage is applied in a constant time period to the coil wire
51a, the rotor 54 is rotated by way of magnetic force of the stator 53, so that the "hour"
is displayed by the hour hand mounted on the hour wheel 45, the "minute" is displayed 
by the minute hand 33 mounted on the minute wheel, and the "second" is displayed by the
second hand 34 mounted on the fourth wheel.However, in the case of the conventional travelling wave type ultrasonic motor,
since two high frequency voltages, having different phases, are input to the vibrating
member so as to rotationally move the moving member to produce the travelling waves,
two sets of the boosting circuit and the driving circuit are required.Also, since the vibrating characteristics of the vibrating member and the
piezoelectric element are changed in response to changes in temperature and the driving
voltages, a complex frequency following circuit is needed so that the voltage, current,
phase and the like which applied to the motor, are continuously followed to changes in the
environment. As a consequence, although the structure of the ultrasonic motor is made
simple, the driving circuits become
