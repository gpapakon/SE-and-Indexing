<ABSTRACT>
A soundproof heat shield member (1) for an exhaust 
manifold comprises a metal substrate (2) of a given three-dimensional 

shape, a nonwoven fabric (3) disposed on a 
surface of the metal substrate (2) facing an exhaust 

manifold, and a woven wire cloth (4) of metal wires disposed 
on a surface of the nonwoven fabric (3) and fixed to the 

metal substrate (2), and is excellent in the sound absorbing 
property, heat shielding property and durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a soundproof heat 
shield member having a three-dimensional shape, and more 
particularly to a soundproof heat shield member suitable 
for an exhaust manifold. In an engine room of an automobile are arranged 
various electronic parts for conducting engine control, 
run control and the like in addition to an engine. 
These electronic parts are exposed to a higher temperature 
from the engine as a heat source, so that they are 
protected by arranging a heat shield member onto the 
heat source. That is, the heat shield member is 
arranged around an exhaust manifold of the engine at a 
given distance separated therefrom to insulate heat from 
the electronic parts. Furthermore, the exhaust manifold 
is generally a noise source, so that the heat shield 
member is required to have a soundproof function. As the conventional soundproof heat shield 
member, there have been known a single metal plate, a 
laminate of plural metal plates, a laminate of plural  
 
metal plates sandwiching an asbestos sheet therebetween 
and the like. However, the conventional soundproof heat 
shield members do not yet develop satisfactory 
soundproof function. In the conventional soundproof 
heat shield member, noise becomes frequently high due to 
solid-borne sound from the exhaust manifold. 
Furthermore, a space between the exhaust manifold and 
the soundproof heat shield member serves as a resonator, 
in which noise from the exhaust manifold is repeatedly 
reflected in the space to amplify the noise and hence 
the noise level in the soundproof heat shield member 
rises. Moreover, when the asbestos sheet is sandwiched 
as a sound absorbing material between the metal plates, 
the outer surface of the metal plate reflects noise and 
hence the sufficient sound absorbing effect is not 
obtained. On the other hand, JP-U-1-158513 discloses a 
cover for exhaust manifold covering the exhaust 
manifold. This cover comprises an inner plate facing 
the exhaust manifold, an outer plate located outside the 
inner plate and a sound absorbing member sandwiching 
between the inner plate and the outer plate, in which 
plural openings are formed in the inner plate. In the 
cover of such a construction, the noise from the exhaust 
manifold is absorbed by the sound absorbing member 
through the openings of the inner plate. However, there  
 
is no consideration that the noise is repeatedly 
reflected on the portion of the inner plate other than 
the openings to amplitude the noise. In this cover, 
therefore, the noise control
