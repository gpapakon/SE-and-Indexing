<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for printing in which the fountain solution for a lithographic printing device is treated by the direct injection of electromagnetic radiation. Most preferably, the electromagnetic radiation is within the radio frequency range and is injected through a conductor directly in contact with the fountain solution. Such treatment eliminates or substantially reduces the need for chemical treatment of the fountain solution, especially the need for isopropyl alcohol or alcohol substitutes.

 PRINTING METHOD AMD APPARATUSCross-Reference to Related Applications. If Any; None.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the art of printing and more specifically to a lithographic printing method and apparatus in which the fountain solution is treated by the injection of electromagnetic radiation. In the most preferred form of the invention, the electromagnetic radiation is in the radio freguency range and injection occurs through a conductor in direct contact with the fountain solution.Description of the Prior ArtNumerous systems have been proposed over the years for treating various aqueous solutions to obtain improvements in certain methods or to achieve certain properties for the treated solution. Several examples of the types of treatment include those involving the use of electromagnets, permanent magnets, ultrasound, electrostatic fields and the like. While some within the scientific community are convinced of the effectiveness of such treatment metaods, considerable skepticism 

remains, and the devices which have been marketed have not received a high degree of commercial success. The types of applications with which such treatment methods have been employed are also widely varied. Some will be described below in connection with the description of certain specific prior art, but generally, they have included the treatment of aqueous solutions to prevent scaling in boilers, cooling towers and the like; the treatment of emulsions; the treatment of certain non- aqueous materials such as fuels for increasing the fuel burning efficiency thereof; the treatment of automobile radiator fluid; and other diverse applications.Several representative samples of such prior art treatment systems will now be disclosed briefly, but particular attention should be direct to the Morse patents, the backgrounds provided therein, and the references cited against same.One such treatment device, called the Ion Stick, utilizes the application of an electrostatic field, as illustrated in a brochure entitled "The Ion Stick", copies of which are provided with this specification. This device is a non-chemical, non-polluting electrostatic water treater energized by its own power pack. Another electrostatic treatment method and device is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,545,887 issued October 8, 1985 to Arnesan, et al.Other devices employ fixed magnets for water treatment. Examples include U.S. Patent No. 4,808,306, issued February 28, 1989 to Mitchell and entitled "Apparatus
