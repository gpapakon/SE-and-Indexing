<ABSTRACT>
An insulating element (10), in particular for noise insulation in vehicles, has an adhesive layer which is covered by a withdrawable protective element (12). In order to facilitate the withdrawal of the protective element (12), this has an outer contour projecting beyond the outer contour (11) of the insulating element (10). During the manufacture of the withdrawal tab (13), a protective element layer is first removed from an adhesive layer of the raw material and is turned up or folded over to the rear. During the subsequent cutting or stamping process of the insulating element (10), the folded-down portion of the protective element layer is only partially included, so that the withdrawal tab (13) is formed. The folded-down withdrawal tab (13) is subsequently led back so that it projects over the outer contour (11) of the insulating element (10) and makes available a sufficiently large gripping surface for withdrawing the protective element (12).

A process for manufacturing an insulating element (10) which
has at least one insulating layer (15) provided with an adhesive

layer (16), the adhesive layer (16) being covered by a tear-off
layer (12) of a protective element, having the step of providing

raw material comprising at least one insulating layer (15), at
least one adhesive layer (16) and a protective-element layer (12)

which is applied thereto, characterized in that the protective-element
layer (12) is removed in some areas by folding it back

from the insulating layer (15) and the adhesive layer (16), in
that the insulating element (10) is cut into the desired shape,

the folded-back protective-element layer (12) being only
partially included and a folded-back removal tab (13) being

formed, and in that the folded-back removal tab (13) is guided
back down onto the cut insulating element (10), thus forming a

removal tab (13) which projects beyond the finished insulating
element (10).
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
protective-element layer (12) is in some areas turned up or

folded over.
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
a cutting edge (19) of the insulating element (10) is arranged

at a small spacing from a bending edge (17) of the protective-element
layer (12).
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the insulating element (10) is a metal sheet or a foil

for noise insulation.
An insulating element (10), in particular for noise
insulation, having at least one adhesive layer (16) which is

covered by a tear-off protective-element layer (12) constructed 
with a removal tab (13) which projects in some areas beyond the

outer contour (11) of the insulating element (10), characterized
in that, in relation to a bending edge (17) of the removal tab

(13), part of the outer contour (11) of the removal tab (13) is
constructed as a mirror-image of part of the outer contour (11)

of the actual insulating element (10).
