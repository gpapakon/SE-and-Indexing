<ABSTRACT>
Provided are a system and method for adjusting a resource 
reservation for multimedia and normal traffic. An initialization file 

is used for storing data concerning a resource including a current 
maximum resource reservation for multimedia traffic. The user is 

presented the current maximum resource reservation, preferably in a 
graphical user interface to allow the user to adjust the resource 

reservation to a new maximum resource reservation in the initialization 
file. One preferred graphical user interface presents a range of 

resource reservations is represented as a scale and the current maximum 
resource reservation as a point on the scale. The resource reservation 

is used by the operating system or other software for reserving a 
portion of the resource. The remainder of the resource is allocated to 

normal traffic.

For Bandwidth Reservation for Multimedia Traffic In Communications
Network" (IBM Docket No. AT9-93-061); commonly assigned, copending
patent application U.S. Serial No. 08/084,053 filed on the same date as
the present application (EP-A-0 632 671 published on 4.1.95) "Method and Apparatus for Reserving System
Resources to Assure Quality of Service" (IBM Docket No. AT9-93-062).The present invention relates to data processing systems. More
particularly, it relates to such systems which reserve resources for
multimedia connections or sessions.It has long been known to provide computer systems coupled
together by means of digital communication networks so that users of the
individual workstations may communicate with one another over the
network. More recently, desktop conferencing, remote presentations,
and other multimedia applications have been proposed between network
users. However, such multimedia applications, as they are associated
with data-intensive sound, voice, and video flows, require concomminant
high bandwidth communication links between distributed computing systems
with minimal communication delay, maximum throughput, and instantaneous
burst communication capability. The requirements of such multimedia
applications make scheduling appropriate resources to provide for
necessary quality of service for multimedia traffic while maintaining
network availability for normal bandwidth traffic very difficult. It is recognized that certain data in a network, such as that
associated with multimedia, may require priority handling. A "quality
of service" has been defined in the literature, which seeks to describe
various parameters which may be specified to define certain minimum
requirements which must be met for transmission of given data types over
the network. See, for example, quality of service standards set forth
in the OSI TP4 interface (publication reference:) and the quality of
service standards defined in CCITTQ.931 (ISDN), Q.933 (frame relay), and
Q.93B (B-ISDN ATM)

<CLAIMS>
A system (52,120) for adjusting a resource reservation for
multimedia and normal traffic in a computer system comprising:


storage means (54) for storing data concerning a computer system
resource, including a current maximum resource reservation value for

reserving a portion of the resource for multimedia traffic;
means for presenting via a user interface (450) the current maximum
resource reservation value;
means (58) for adjusting the current maximum resource reservation
value to a new maximum resource reservation value in response to input

via the user interface; and
means (58) for reserving a portion of the resource according to the
new maximum resource reservation value and for reserving a remainder of

the resource for normal traffic.
A system as recited in claim 1, wherein the storage means (54)
comprises a data structure which contains default data concerning the

current maximum resource reservation.
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, which further comprises
means to enter the resource data in the storage means.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, which further
comprises means for searching the computer system for an application file

containing the resource data.
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, which
further comprises means for benchmarking the resource to determine the

resource data.
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
user interface includes a graphical user interface in which a range of

resource reservations is represented as a scale and the current maximum
resource reservation as a point on the scale.
A method for adjusting a resource reservation for multimedia and
normal traffic in a computer system comprising the steps of:


storing data concerning a computer system resource including a
current maximum resource reservation value for reserving a portion of the

resource for multimedia traffic;
presenting (407,415,423) the current maximum resource reservation
value via a user interface (450) of a system display;
adjusting (306,313,320,326,335) the maximum resource reservation
value to a new maximum resource reservation value in response to input

via the user interface; and 
reserving (332,336,409,417,425) a portion of the resource according
to the new maximum resource reservation value and reserving a remainder

of the resource for normal traffic.
A method as recited in claim 7 wherein the storing step includes
the step of retrieving default data concerning the current maximum

resource reservation value.
A method as recited in claim 7 which further comprises the step of
searching the computer system for an application file containing the

resource data.
A method as recited in claim 7 which further comprises the step of
benchmarking the resource to determine the resource data.
A method according to any one of claims 7 to 10, wherein the
presenting step includes presenting a graphical user interface in which a

range of resource reservations is represented as a scale and the current
maximum re
source reservation as a point on the scale.
