<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst comprising silica and sulphuric acid which impregnates the said silica, and the use of the said catalyst in catalytic alkylation of isobutane and/or isopentane in the presence of at least one olefin containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule, the said catalyst being characterised in that, before its impregnation with sulphuric acid, the silica has a total pore volume greater than 1.5 cm
<

>
/g and in that the said catalyst consists essentially of particles with a mean diameter of between 0.1 and 150  mu m.

<CLAIMS>
Catalyst containing silica and an acid phase consisting of sulphuric 
acid, the silica having been impregnated with said acid phase and 

said catalyst being characterised in that it is essentially composed 
of particles with an average diameter of between 0.1 and 150 µm, 

and in that the silica, prior to its impregnation with said acid phase, 
has a total porous volume greater than 1.5 cm
3
 per gram. 
Catalyst according to claim 1 such that its content by weight of acid 
phase is greater than 70%. 
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 or 2 such that the silica has, 
prior to its impregnation with said acid phase, a total porous volume 

of between 1.5 and 6 cm

in a concentration of between 90 and 100% by weight. 
Use of the catalyst according to one of claims 1 to 6 or prepared 
according to claim 7 in a process of catalytic alkylation of at least 

one element selected from the group formed by isobutane and 
isopentane by at least one element selected from the group formed 

by olefins containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule, in which 
the reaction temperature is lower than 10°C. 
Use according to claim 8 in which the catalyst is used in a perfect 
or near-perfect mixture reaction zone. 
Use according to one of claims 8 or 9 in which the catalyst is used 
in a co-flow fluidised bed.
