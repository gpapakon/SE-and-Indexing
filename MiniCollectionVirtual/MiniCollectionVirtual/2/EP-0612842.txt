<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions for 
washing textile materials in automatic cycles 
characterized in that the builder additives contained 
in said compositions are constituted by, or comprise, 
in mixture with conventional builders, one or more 
polyaminoacid(s) at a level of less than 5% by weight. By the term "textile materials", within the 
context of the instant invention, woven materials or 
textile fibres either of natural origin or man-made, 
are meant. By the terms "composition", "formulation" or 
"formulate", those products are meant within the 
context of the present invention, which are designed 
for use in textile materials washing. It is widely known that the detergency products 
are among the causes of the presence of phosphorus in 
waters: among all of them, the effect of sodium 
tripolyphosphate (STPP), used as a detergency builder, 
was evidenced. Also known are the efforts aiming at searching 
for alternatives to polyphosphates, but the solutions 
tried from time to time not always supplied 
satisfactory results because, when STPP is either 
removed or its content in formulates is reduced, the 
negative effect on the washing process is greater than 
as expected from the simple decrease in sequestering 
capabilities of the detergent matrix. This unsatisfactory situation results from the 
impossibility of locating a product which displays the  
 
same characteristics as of SPTT, i.e., besides 
controlling water hardness, acting as a buffer, and 
acting as a soil release and soil suspending agent, as 
well as performing soil anti-redeposition actions. The most widely used compound in order to replace 
STPP in such formulates, is Zeolite A (sodium alumino 
silicate). At present, Zeolite A is used both in powder and 
in liquid compositions. As regards the negative effects on the 
environment, this product is acceptable: it does not 
constitute a risk for water bodies and, by being 
inorganic and insoluble, it does not increase the BOD 
load to waste waters treating facilities. From the view point of detergency, Zeolite A 
displays good adsorption capabilities for dyes and 
pigments released by fabrics and its ion-exchange 
capability increases with increasing temperature. 
Drawbacks are its slow exchange kinetics, in 
particular as regards magnesium, its absence of 
buffering action, and its having to be dispersed. Therefore, Zeolite A is always used in 
association with other components (referred to as 
"builder additives" or "co-builders"). The presently used products for

Powder and liquid compositions suitable for 
textile material washing, comprising from 5 to 40% by 

weight of one or more surfactant(s), from 5 to 50% by 
weight of Zeolite A, from 0.5 to 70% by weight of one 

or more additive(s) selected from bleaches,

as such or partially salified, and possibly from 0.2%

glucose, maleic anhydride/acrylic acid copolymers, 
maleic anhydride copolymers with compounds bearing 

allyl or vinyl groups, maleic anhydride/ethylene oxide 
copolymers, glyoxylic acid/formaldehyde copolymer.
