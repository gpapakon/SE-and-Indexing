<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable overhead mounted door holder assembly (10) 
for attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door (12) to 

hold the door in an open position includes a jamb bracket 
(16) attached to the door jamb (14) and a jamb arm (18) 

pivotally attached to the jamb bracket (16). A channel 
assembly (22) having a longitudinally extending channel 

(23) is attached to the door, and a spring (42, 43) 
assisted assembly holds the door in an open position 

assisted by frictional force. The amount of friction is 
adjustable by altering a rotational position of an 

eccentric cam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adjustable overhead door 
holder assembly and, more particularly, to a friction 
adjusted overhead mounted door holder assembly having a low 
profile suitable for mounting in a door top inset. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is often 
necessary for convenience and safety. One commonly 
employed method uses an overhead mounted door control 
device that includes a pivoting arm attached between an 
upper portion of a door jamb and an upper part of a door. 
When the door is to be held open at an angle that does not 
exceed about 110 degrees, an overhead mounted door control 
device is efficient, effective, convenient to install and 
maintain, is less subject to damage by vandalism or 
accidents and does not present a potential stumbling 
hazard. However, many conventional overhead mounted door control 
devices are difficult to mount in an inset door top 
properly because of their thickness. The time consuming 
and expensive modifications to the door required to 
properly fit the door holder can cause building managers to 
omit or postpone installation of door holders necessary for 
convenience or safety. Alternatively, marginal performance 
conventional low profile door holders may be attached, 
leading to dissatisfaction and high maintenance and 
replacement costs. What is needed is an overhead door holder assembly that is 
durable, easy to install as an inset into the top of a 
door, and adjustable or replaceable with minimal effort and 
expertise. The door holder should be set to permit easy 
engagement to hold the door against minor jostling  
 
contacts, and yet still permit closing the door without 
undue effort. In addition, the door hold position should 
be easily selectable and act at any angle of door opening. Such a door holder should not require special tools for 
installation or maintenance, and should have features to 
prevent damage from violent or forceful door opening. The 
door should automatically be held in an open position after 
it is swung open to a predetermined angle, and should allow 
for easy controllable release from its held open position 
when desired. US-A-1 573 456 relates to a friction controlled door holder 
assembly with features according to the preamble of claim 
1. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
adjustable overhead mounted door holder assembly for 
attachment between a door jamb and a door, for selectively 
holding the door, comprising a jamb bracket for attachment 
to the door jamb; a jamb arm
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An adjustable overhead mounted door holder assembly 
(10) for attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door 

(12), for selectively holding the door, comprising a jamb 
bracket for attachment to the door jamb; a jamb arm 

pivotally attached to the jamb bracket; a channel assembly 
(22) having a channel (23) therein defined by channel 

walls; a slide assembly (26) positioned for movement in the 
channel, the slide assembly being adapted for pivotal 

attachment to the jamb arm (18) and having at least one 
spring (42, 43) urging at least one friction pad (44, 

45) against the channel wall and an adjustment assembly for 
varying friction force of said at least one friction pad 

against the channel wall; characterised in that there are 
two said springs (42, 43) respectively urging first and 

second friction pads against a respective channel wall and 
the adjustment assembly comprises a friction cam (38) which 

is adjustable to vary compressive force of both springs, 
said friction cam being positioned between said first and 

second friction springs. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said 
friction cam has an elliptical cross section. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
friction cam further comprises a threaded shaft (41) held 

in locked position by a nut (40). 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
slide assembly (26) further comprises a slider (36) having 

a plurality of serrations (37), and said friction cam (38) 
has a plurality of serrations (39) for locked engagement 

with the serrations on the slider.  
 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein each spring (42, 43) has a U-shaped 

cross section. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a spring support (24) is attached to the 

channel assembly (22) at a fixed position within the 
channel (23), with further springs (32, 33) being attached 

to the spring support to resist compressive force of the 
slide assembly (36) as the slide assembly approaches the 

spring support. 
An assembly according to claim 6, 
wherein said further springs (32, 33) are 

longitudinally positioned in the channel (23) in parallel, 
spaced apart relationship to each other, with both these 

springs having substantially equal spring constants and 
resistance to compressive force. 
A door holder assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the slide assembly further 

comprises a slider (36) having a plurality of serrations 
(37), and the friction cam (38) has a plurality of 

serrations (39) for locked engagement with the serrations 
on the slider, with the friction cam having a threaded 

shaft (41) that can be held in locked position by a 
separately attachable nut (40) after the serrations on the 

slider and the serrations on the friction cam are 
intermeshed in locking engagement. 
A door incorporating a door holder assembly according 
to any one of the preceding claims.
