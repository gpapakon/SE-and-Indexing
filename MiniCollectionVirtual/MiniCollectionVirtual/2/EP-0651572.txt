<ABSTRACT>
An electronic apparatus that functions through an image display 
device, in particular a video cassette recorder; the main 

characteristic of the described electronic device consists in 
the fact that it provides control means that allow at least two 

operative conditions of the apparatus and that allow, in one of 
said two operative conditions, the demonstration of all the 

essential functions of the apparatus, without the relative 
actual realisation of the operations taking place, so as to 

teach the user, by way of sending command signals, the use of 
the apparatus without placing at risk the result of the 

operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic apparatus that 
functions through an image display device, in particular a video 
cassette recorder. It is known that video recorders are among the most complicated 
to use of domestic apparatuses, due to the multiplicity of 
functions provided; furthermore an error by the user can easily 
have at times irreparable consequences, such as the undesired 
cancellation of an important recording. The aim of the present invention is that of indicating how it is 
possible to realise a video recorder that eliminates, or greatly 
reduces, the aforementioned drawbacks of the known apparatuses. In view of realising such aim, the present invention has as its 
subject an electronic apparatus that functions through an image 
display device, in particular a video cassette recorder,  
 
characterised in that it provides control means that allow at 
least two operative conditions of the apparatus and that allow, 
in one of said two operative conditions, the demonstration of 
all the essential functions of the apparatus, without the 
relative actual realisation of the operations taking place, so 
as to teach the user, by way of sending command signals, the use 
of the apparatus without placing at risk the result of the 
operation. The invention is based on the acknowledgement of the fact that, 
so as to avoid as far as possible errors of use, it is important 
that the user has learnt well all the commands and their 
effects, before actually operating the apparatus. The characteristics and advantages of the present invention 
shall result in being clear from the following description and 
annexed drawings supplied purely as an explanatory and non-limiting 
example, wherein: 
figure 1 represents the simplified block diagram of a video 
recorder according to the invention; figure 2 schematically represents a significant part of the 
logic control circuit of the video recorder of figure 1. figure 3 schematically represents a second significant part of 
the logic control circuit of the video recorder of figure 1. In figure 1, that schematically represents in a simplified 
manner the circuit of a video recorder according to the 
invention, reference number 13 indicates the input for the 
signal of the antenna of the receiving circuits block 1 of the 
apparatus. Reference number 10 indicates a tuner, reference number 11 the 
intermediate frequency amplifier, and reference number 12 the 
video detector; said circuits are all of the conventional type. Reference number 2 indicates a

<CLAIMS>
Electronic apparatus that functions through an image display 
device, in particular a video cassette recorder, characterised 

in that it provides control means (2; 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 
106, 107, 108, 109, 110) that allow at least two operative 

conditions (Normal, Learn, Caution) of the apparatus and that 
allow, in one (Learn, Caution) of said two operative conditions, 

the demonstration of all the essential functions of the 
apparatus, without the relative actual realisation of the 

operations taking place, so as to teach the user, by way of 
sending command signals, the use of the apparatus without 

placing at risk the result of the operation. 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said two provided operative conditions comprise a first 

condition (Normal) of normal operations and a second condition 
(Learn) in which only information on the effect of the command 

signal generated in following the selecting of a key of a 
command device (16), without realising any actual operation. 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that in said second condition (Learn) a text containing, both 

the description of the pressed key, and eventually a warning of 
the precautions to take for avoiding undesirable effects, is 

displayed. 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said control means (2) comprise verifying means (101) for 

ascertaining whether a key (17) has been pressed on the command 
device (16) corresponding to said second operative condition 

(Learn) and means (102) for enabling, in the affirmative case, 
said second operative state (Learn). 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said control means (2) allow three operative conditions 

(Normal, Learn, Caution) and precisely a first normal operative 
 

condition (Normal), a second condition (Learn) in which only 
information on the effect of the command generated by way of 

selecting the command device is displayed, and a third condition 
(Caution), in which the text is initially displayed, as in the 

second condition (Learn), and by sending once again the same 
command generated by operating the same command device, the 

corresponding effective operation is enabled. 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in 
that said control means (2) comprise verifying means (201) for 

ascertaining whether a given key (Caution) has been pressed on 
the command device corresponding to said third operative 

condition (Caution) and means (202) for enabling, in the 
affirmative case, said third operative state (Caution). 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that said control means (2) comprise memory means (ROM) 

containing the information to display for the user, and means 
(108, 109) for calling the information corresponding to the key 

pressed by the user, and to display it on the screen. 
Electronic apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that said control means (2) comprise memory means (ROM) 

containing the information to display for the user, and means 
(208, 209) for calling the information corresponding to the key 

pressed by the user, and to display it on the screen. 
Electronic apparatus that functions through an image display 
device, according to one or more of the previous claims, 

characterised in that it is a television. 
Electronic apparatus that functions through an image display 
device, according to one or more of the previous claims, 

characterised in that it is a video disc reader.
