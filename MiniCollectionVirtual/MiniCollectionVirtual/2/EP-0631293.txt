A thick-film planar inductor is made according to a specific 
geometry with conventional techniques. Such device is then 

operatively calibrated for tuning the circuit to which it is 
connected by changing the geometry of the inductor through

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a planar inductor
calibrated for obtaining the optimum value
for tuning a radio frequency electronic circuit. Such
callibrations allows the tuning to be carried out in a completely
automatic way, the operative calibration being effected by
changing the geometry of the planar inductor.The tuning of a RF electronic circuit is usually carried out
by changing the value of the LC components of an oscillating
circuit. In most cases the capacity is changed by means of
varying capacitors. This involves the use of varying
capacitors of relatively high cost as well as a tuning
unstability in time. Moreover, in case a wire inductor is
used, the tuning process consisting in a manual deformation
of the inductor is a long, little precise operation.On the other hand thick-film planar coils as well as the
method of calculating the size thereof are known at the
state of art, however, such planar components are
essentially fixed-value inductances and should have a
varying capacitor connected in parallel for tuning the
circuit.JP Patent A-4,148,514 relates to an inductance adjustment method by shaving off at least
one part of a conductor pattern which forms a printed coil on a substrate.The inductance of the printed coil is set so as to be smaller than a prescribed value. While the
inductance of the printed coil and the resonance frequency of a resonance circuit formed of
the printed coil are being measured, one part of the conductor pattern is shaved off from its
side part. When the prescribed value is obtained, the shaving operation is stopped.JP Patent A-4,094,505 relates to an inductance adjustment method by removing the edge of
the conductor. Pattern which forms a printed coil on a substrate. The spiral-shaped conductor
pattern comprises an inductance adjustment section, the adge of the latter is gradually
removed by a laser beam or other means while measuring the inductance and reducing the
area until the inductance reaches a specified value.The present invention seeks to provide a thick-film planar
inductor which allows a RF calibration for the
tuning to be fully automated. A further object of
the present invention is to provide a serigraph planar 
inductor which cannot be deformed due to any mechanical
stress occurring in the circuit.Still another object of the present invention consists in
that the serigraph planar inductor is made by an apparatus
operating according to the thick-film technology of standard
use and limited cost in the frame of the present techniques
of construction of

<CLAIMS>
A thick-film planar inductor formed by a serigraph
sediment of conductive thick-film pastes, and through an

operative automatic calibration which modifies the geometry
of the inductor while tuning the circuit in which the

inductor is connected, characterized in that the geometry
of the serigraph inductor and the value of the inductance

is changed by varying the length of the path of the
deposited conductive layer, having said geometry of the

serigraph inductor suitable areas, the form of which can be
changed by means of a kerf (C) which is made in the

stripe of the conductive material, thus providing the
extension of the inductor by separating two edges (C', C"). 
A thick-film planar inductor according to claim 1
characterized in that the geometry of the inductor is of the

square spiral or fret type.
