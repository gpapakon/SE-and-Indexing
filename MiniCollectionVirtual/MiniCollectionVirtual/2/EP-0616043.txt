<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a member which is 
made of novel austenitic steel, and is in contact with 
high-temperature, high-pressure water under irradiation, 
and more particularly to austenitic steel having a 
superior resistance to intergranular hydrogen embrittlement, 
and also to a novel nuclear reactor and a novel 
nuclear fission reactor which use the same. At present, stainless steel JIS 304 or 316 has 
been used for structural members for a core structure 
and equipment of a light water reactor, and measures 
have been taken for such steel to enhance a corrosion 
resistance and a resistance to intergranular fracture 
susceptibility in an environment in which such steel is 
used. For example, as a method of relieving or 
preventing intergranular cracking from occurring due to 
intergranular corrosion and intergranular stress 
corrosion cracking (hereinafter referred collectively to 
as "intergranular corrosion") in steel used in high-temperature 
water, there is known a method, as disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 1-18143 and 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 62-238355 
and 62-238353, in which the amount of carbon contained  
 
in stainless steel is reduced, and a carbide stabilizing 
element such as Nb and Ti is added to suppress or 
prevent a Cr exhaustion phenomenon from occurring in the 
vicinity of a grain boundary. Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication No. 62-107047 discloses a method 
of preventing intergranular corrosion from occurring due 
to neutron irradiation, in which Si and P are reduced, 
and an element for producing stable carbide, such as Mo, 
Nb and Ti, is added to suppress the formation of carbide 
of Cr. Further, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 
No. 3-72054 discloses a method in which the arrangement 
of components is adjusted in such a manner that a volume 
size factor of Cr relative to an average atomic volume 
of a matrix phase in stainless steel is 0.900 - 1.030, 
thereby suppressing the mechanism of producing an 
irradiation-induced intergranular Cr-shortage layer. 
These techniques have been developed for the purpose of 
suppressing the occurrence of the Cr-shortage layer in 
the vicinity of the grain boundary to enhance a resistance 
to intergranular corrosion in high-temperature, 
high-pressure water, and have been intended particularly 
for stainless steel used for parts of a core structure 
of a nuclear reactor and a first wall of a nuclear 
fission reactor. However, it has been found that when such 
stainless steel is
