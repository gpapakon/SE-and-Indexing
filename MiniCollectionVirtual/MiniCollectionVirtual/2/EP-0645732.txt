<ABSTRACT>
A device for controlling the positioning of the cursor 
displayed on the screen of interactive systems includes: a 

manual actuation element which is similar to a button and 
reacts, when pressed in any eccentric point of its surface 

(with respect to which a system of perpendicular 
coordinated axes X and Y is defined), by rocking, that is 

to say by tilting in the direction of the point where 
pressure is applied (to an extent determined by ergonomic 

criteria together with the other shape and elastic reaction 
characteristics of the button); sensor means (21-25; 42-48) 

which are operatively associated with the actuation element 
and are suitable to provide signals corresponding to the 

components in the directions X and Y of the consequent 
rotations; a logic controller (15) for analyzing the 

signals periodically and for calculating, for each cycle, 
an incremental movement to be applied to the cursor in the 

direction corresponding to the direction of the rocking 
motion and at a speed that increases as the associated 

modulus increases; a logic unit (16-20) for accumulating 
the calculated movements and for transmitting the 

corresponding information to a system in a manner that is 
compatible with an ordinary mouse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
controlling the positioning of the cursor displayed on the 
screen of personal computers, workstations, video terminals 
and generally of interactive systems that dialogue with the 
operator by means of images, either artificially generated 
or taken from reality. As is known, a cursor is positioned by the operator in 
order to point at items of the displayed images, select 
them, engage them and cause the displaying system to move 
them, et cetera. Cursor control is performed by virtue of devices which 
are generally termed "pointing devices", such as a mouse, a 
trackball, a joystick, and the like. Existing pointing devices generally convert the 
movements of an actuation element controlled by the 
operator (in the case of the mouse, the body itself of the 
device) into signals used to control the proportional 
movements of the cursor on the screen. A low or high proportionality factor is matched by a 
respectively low or high sensitivity of the control chain; 
sensitivity can also vary dynamically. This arrangement has some intrinsic disadvantages: 
a) if sensitivity is low, considerable space must be 
devoted to the pointing device: for example, the smooth and 
uncluttered worktable surface required to make a mouse run. 
Devices that require such space cannot be integrated with a 
keyboard and can be awkward in use due to the extent of the 
movements that they require (both to operate them and to  
 
move one's hand between said devices and the associated 
keyboards).  b) If sensitivity is high, the natural difficulty of 
controlling very small hand movements arises. For example, 
it becomes easy to induce unwanted movements of the cursor 
due to trembling or small involuntary movements of the 
hand.   Often it is not possible to find a compromise that 
avoids both drawbacks even by providing dynamically 
variable sensitivity. The measurement of significant movements furthermore 
entails, in many pointing devices, the presence of moving 
parts that make them subject to wear, to the need for 
maintenance, and to limitations in reliability. In order to overcome these problems, static pointing 
devices, such as the one proposed in European publication 
no. 433205 filed by International Business Machines 
Corporation, Armonk (USA), have been introduced. This 
device is integrated in the keyboard of a computer and 
controls cursor movements through the application of forces 
to an actuation button; the components of the force that 
are tangent to the plane

manual actuation element (1) which is formed by a hollow 
cylinder (2), by a button (4) which is supported so that it
