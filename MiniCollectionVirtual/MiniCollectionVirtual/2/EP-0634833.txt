<ABSTRACT>
A control system is disclosed for a power 
converter (3) having a plurality of self-turn-off 

devices and connected to a supply system (1) through a 
transformer (2) provided with a core. The control 

system includes circuit for generating a target value 
for an output voltage of the power converter, and a 

correction circuit for correcting the target value, 
based on a value representing magnetic flux of the core 

of the transformer, to generate a corrected target 
value. The power converter (3) is controlled to output 

the target value. DC magnetization of the transformer 
is suppressed even for the case when DC converter is 

generated by the supply system. The value representing 
magnetic flux is obtained either from the primary and 

secondary currents (i₁, i₂) or from direct flux 
measurement (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system for a power
converter, and more particularly relates to a control system
for a power converter which is composed of self-turn-off
devices such as, gate turn-off thyristors (hereafter, simply
GTOs), and is connected to a power system or loads via
transformers, which can prevent DC magnetization of the
transformer.Figure 7 shows a schematic diagram of a prior art
control system for a power converter which is composed of
GTOs (hereafter, called a self-commutated converter), and is
used in a DC transmission system or a static var compensator
and so on.In Figure 7:
1 is a power system;2 is a transformer for connecting a self-commutated 
converter 3 composed of GTOs and power system 1;4 is a DC power source such as capacitors etc.;5 is a current detector which measures the output
current of self-commutated converter 3;6 is a potential transformer which measures the voltage
of power system 1;7 is a control circuit which controls the system
voltage according to a system voltage reference 51;8 is a DC component detector which detects the DC
component contained in the output current of self-commutated
converter 3 measured by current detector 5;9 is an adder which adds the output of control circuit
7 which is an instruction value for the output voltage of
self-commutated converter 3, and the output of DC component
detector 8;10 is a pulse-width modulation (PWM) control circuit
which adjusts the output voltage of self-commutated
converter 3 by determining the firing timing of the GTOs in
response to the output of adder 9; and11 is a gate pulse amplifier circuit for generating
gate pulses for GTOs in self-commutated converter 3.In Figure 7, PWM control circuit 10 determines the GTO
firing pattern so that no DC component is contained in the
output voltage of self-commutated converter 3. However, the
actual output voltage takes a waveform which contains a DC
component due to the variations in the characteristic of the 
GTO and the variations in the gate signal transmission time.When the output voltage of self-commutated converter 3
contains a DC component, the core of transformer 2 is
magnetized asymmetrically because the voltage time product
per cycle applied to transformer 2 does not become "0".
Thus, the excitation current increases, and the output
current of self-commutated converter 3 becomes over-current.
This leads the stopping of operation of self-commutated
converter 3 for its protection. In the worst case, this
sometimes leads to damage to the devices forming the
