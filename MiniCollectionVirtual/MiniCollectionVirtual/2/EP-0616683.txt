<DESCRIPTION>
This invention
relates to a cartridge assembly according to the Pre-characterising features of claims 1 and 3 respectively. It also relates to a method of cannon cartridge assembly.A large caliber APFSDS cartridge typically has a
combustible case attached to a saboted long rod
penetrator. The sabot has a front bore riding support
or bourrelet and a rear bore riding support or
bourrelet. The case is attached to the aft bourrelet on
the sabot. The aft bourrelet is a solid cylindrical
portion that forms a closure on the case mouth, thus
retaining the propellant in the case. The front
bourrelet is spaced from the case mouth and includes a
scoop to catch onrushing air upon projectile exit from
the gun tube. The scoop shaped front bourrelet permits
onrushing air to separate the segments of the sabot from
the fin stabilized long rod penetrator. The propelling
gases push against the aft face of the aft bourrelet to
push the projectile through the tube. When such a
cartridge is inserted in the gun chamber, there is a
toroidal void formed between the front and aft
bourrelets and the inside surface of the gun tube. This
void conventionally serves no useful function.U.S. Patent No. 4,964,342, issued to Schleicher on
October 23, 1990, discloses a sabot arrangement for an
APFSDS projectile having front and aft bourrelets which
has passages through the aft bourrelet. The passages
through the aft bourrelet permit propelling gases to act 
upon the rear face of the front bourrelet to pull the
saboted projectile through the gun tube.U.S. Patent No. 4,974,517, issued to Kraft et al on
Dec. 4, 1990, discloses an APFSDS round with passages
through the aft bourrelet connecting the space between
the bourrelets with the propellant case. A combustible,
or thin rupturable barrier separates the propellant in
the case from the passage into the void between the
bourrelets.U.S. Patent No. 4,936,220, issued to Burns et al on
June 26, 1990, discloses a saboted projectile having a
scoop front bourrelet and a cylindrical rear bourrelet
with a tubular sleeve between them made of a combustible
material. Several plugged through bores through the aft
bourrelet connect the toroidal cavity between the
bourrelets with the rear face of the aft bourrelet. A
portion of the propelling charge is contained within the
toroidal cavity. This portion of the charge is
sequentially ignited after ignition of the main charge
by an igniter mounted in an unsealable blowout plug in
the through bore or a delay charge/seal positioned in
each of the through bores.
