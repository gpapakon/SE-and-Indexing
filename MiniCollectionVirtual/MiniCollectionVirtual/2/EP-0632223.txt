<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a copper pipe with a plastic sheathing, having inwardly projecting webs (4) which run in the longitudinal direction of the pipe (2) and are supported on the pipe surface. In order that the copper pipe with plastic sheathing fulfils the high safety requirements made on collectors laid in the ground, the sheath (3) applied onto the copper pipe (2) consists of a high-density thermoplastic polymer, the distance (t) between the webs (4), supported on the pipe surface, being between 3 and 10 mm and the maximum web height (h) being 4 mm.

<CLAIMS>
Plastic-encased copper pipe for use as a safety pipe
for ground collectors in heat pump installations, the

plastic casing (3) of which exhibits ribs (4) running in
the longitudinal direction of the pipe (2), projecting

inwards and bearing on the surface of the pipe,

characterised by the combination of the following
features:


the casing (3) is made of a high-density thermoplastic;
the spacing (t) of the ribs (4) on the surface of the
pipe lies in a range from 3 to 10 mm;
the maximum rib height (h) is 4 mm;
the annular space (5) between the pipe (2) and the
casing (3) is filled with an environmentally friendly

liquid.
Plastic-encased copper pipe according to claim 1,
characterised in that the outside diameter (D) of the

casing (3) is at least 1.2 times greater than the outside
diameter (d) of the pipe (2
).
Plastic-encased copper pipe according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that the ribs (4) exhibit a cross-section

which tapers in the direction of the surface of
the pipe.
Plastic-encased copper pipe according to claim 3,
characterised in that the cross-section of the ribs (4)

is triangular.
Plastic-encased copper pipe according to claim 1,
characterised in that the casing (3) is made of hard

polyethylene from the PE-HD group.
