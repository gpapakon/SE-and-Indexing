forms images when it is orientated either horizontally 

or upright, comprising a rotary, endless latent image 
carrier, a latent image forming unit (22) for forming a 

latent image on the latent image carrier (20), a 
developing unit (23) for developing the latent image on 

the latent image carrier (20) using powdered developer, 
a transferring unit (24) for transferring a developed 

image on the latent image carrier (20) to a sheet, and 
a positioning mechanism (6) for positioning the 

developing unit (23) relative to the latent image 
carrier (20), either at a first position corresponding 

to an upright orientation of the apparatus or at a 
second position corresponding to a horizontal 

orientation of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus that can perform image forming while positioned 
either upright or horizontally, and particularly to an 
image forming apparatus that in consonance with its 
installed attitude feeds powered developer from a developing 
unit to a latent image carrier. To satisfy the demand for plain paper image recording, 
latent image forming apparatuses, such as electrophotographic 
apparatuses, are employed for such image forming 
apparatuses as copy machines, printers, and facsimile 
machines. In such an image forming apparatus, 
electrostatic latent images are formed on a photosensitive 
drum, and are developed by using powdered developer to 
visualize the images. After the developed images are 
transferred to a sheet of paper, the transferred images are 
fixed to the sheet. As efficient utilization of office space is one of the 
objects of the recent trend towards automated offices, a 
demand has arisen for image forming apparatuses that can be 
positioned either upright or horizontally. Dependent on 
user need and preference, such an apparatus can be installed 
where the available space is restricted either horizontally 
or vertically.  
 Usually, electrophotographic printers are positioned 
and operated horizontally, that is, with their sheet feeding 
paths parallel to their base planes. The arrangement of 
the internally mounted developing units, etc. of these 
printers is designed for the effective utilization of 
gravitational attraction. Therefore such printers function 
imperfectly when they are positioned and operated upright, 
that is, with their sheet feeding paths perpendicular to 
their base planes. As examples of prior art, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. Sho 58-130345 and Japanese Unexamined 
Utility Model Publication No. Sho 60-184061 disclose how to 
transport in an upright position image forming apparatuses 
that are operated horizontally. According to these prior 
art examples, spillage of powdered developer is prevented 
even when the apparatus is transported upright. For this 
purpose, a magnet is provided inside the developing unit to 
attract and retain the developer therein, or the developer 
is retained in the lower portion of the developing unit by 
gravity. When such conventional image forming apparatuses are 
installed upright, however, the directional effect of 
gravity on the developing units is changed and internally 
stored powdered developer flows in a different direction. 
As a result, a developing process
