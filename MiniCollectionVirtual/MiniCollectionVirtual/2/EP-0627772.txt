<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compound semiconductor light 
emitting device, and more precisely to an AlGaInP light emitting 
device which has an active layer made of AlGaInP mixed crystals. AlGaInP-type materials are direct transition-type materials 
with the largest bandbap energies among III-V group compound 
semiconductor mixed crystals, with the exception of nitrides, and 
are receiving much attention as materials for visible light 
emitting devices in the 550-650 nm band (green to red region). 
An AlGaInP light emitting device, which has an active layer made 
of AlGaInP with such a large direct bandgap energy, can produce 
light emission with much higher brightness than the conventional 
ones using indirect transition-type materials such as GaP and 
GaAsP. Figure 3 shows a schematic cross section of one example of  
 
conventional AlGaInP light emitting devices. This AlGaInP light 
emitting device 10 has the following structure: An n-type 
(AlxGa1-x)0.51In0.49P cladding layer 12 (approximately 1µm 
thick), an (AlyGa1-y)0.51In0.49P active layer 13 (approximately 0.6 
µm thick), a p-type (AlzGa1-z)0.51In0.49P cladding layer 14 
(approximately 1µm thick) and a p-type current spreading 
layer (a p-type layer to spread current effectively) 15 (several 
micrometers thick) are formed, one after another, on an n-type 
GaAs substrate 11, and a p-side electrode (top surface electrode) 
16 and an n-side electrode (bottom surface electrode) 17 are 
provided on said p-type current spreading layer 15 and on the 
bottom surface of the n-type GaAs substrate 11, respectively. Here, the AlGaInP double heterojunction structure comprising 
the (AlyGa1-y)0.51In0.49P active layer 13 and the two AlGaInP cladding 
layers which have the bandgap energies larger than that of said 
active layer 13, i.e. the n-type (AlxGa1-x)0.51In0.49P cladding layer 
12 and the p-type (AlzGa1-z)0.51In0.49P cladding layer 14, constitutes 
the light emitting layer portion 18, and said 
(AlyGa1-y)0.51In0.49P active layer 13 functions as the light emitting 
layer. The ratios of Al composition, i.e. x, y and z, in the 
AlGaInP layers which constitute said AlGaInP double 
heterojunction structure satisfy the following relationships:  
 
0 ≦ y ≦ 0.7, y < x, and y < z. Hereafter, if there are no special reasons, said 
(AlxGa1-x)0.51In0.49P, (AlyGa1-y)0.51In0.49P and (AlzGa1-z)0.51In0.49P are 
generically called "(AlBGa1-B)0.51In0.49P", or abbreviated as "AlGaInP 
". An AlGaInP light emitting device such as described above 
requires a current
