<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a sterilization test device with a test chamber designed to hold an indicator and a feed line to introduce the test atmosphere into the chamber, which otherwise is sealed off or can be sealed off from the test atmosphere. The invention proposes that the feed line is formed by capillaries extending from the test chamber at one end to the ambient atmosphere surrounding the test device at the other end. This gives a test device of small dimensions which provides a reliable display of the test result and a high degree of protection against intentional and unintentional manipulations.
