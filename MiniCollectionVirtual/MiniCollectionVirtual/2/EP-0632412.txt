<ABSTRACT>
A mailing machine comprising, a base (12) including a 
deck (18), a postage meter (14) removably mounted on the base, the 

postage meter including a rotary postage printing drum (48) 
overhanging the deck, the base including means for 

feeding an envelope (22) in a downstream path of travel to the 
drum, the base including means for selectively driving 

the drum for printing postage on an envelope fed thereto, 
envelope deflecting means (70) including an elongate 

substantially rectangularly-shaped member having a 
predetermined length, the member including a 

substantially horizontally-extending first portion of the 
length thereof fixedly attached to the drum, the member 

including a second portion of the length thereof inclined 
downwardly from the first portion, the member including a 

third portion of the length thereof inclined upwardly 
from the second portion, the member including a fourth 

portion of the length thereof extending substantially 
horizontally from the third portion and disposed between 

and in sliding engagement with the drum and the first 
portion, and the second and third portions cooperatively 

defining a lower marginal peak edge overhanging the deck 
and extending transversely of the path of travel for 

urging an envelope fed beneath the drum into sliding 
engagement with the deck.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally concerned with a mailing 
machine including a postage meter having a rotary postage 
printing drum provided with an envelope deflector, and 
more particularly, with an improved deflector. U.S. Patent No. 3,072,052 for Automatic Feeding 
Apparatus, issued January 8, 1963 to Bach, and assigned 
to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a 
mailing machine including a base, having an inking 
roller, and including a postage meter, having a rotary 
postage printing drum which is removably mounted on the 
base. The mailing machine additionally includes 
structure for feeding envelopes therethrough in a 
downstream path of travel to the postage meter. And, 
downstream from the postage printing drum, the mailing 
machine includes outfeed roller structure, including a 
spring loaded roller in the meter, for urging envelopes 
downwardly, and a driven feed roller in the base for 
feeding envelopes beneath the spring loaded roller out of 
the machine. U.S. Patent No. 5,268,836 for a Mailing Machine 
Including Printing Drum Decleration And Coasting Control 
System, by Eckert, Jr., et. al., and assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention, discloses a mailing 
machine of the aforesaid type which includes a control 
system in the base for operating the mailing machine in 
various modes of operation, including, inter alia, "print 
and seal" and "seal only" modes of operation. In the 
"print and seal" mode, the postage printing drum is 
driven through a single revolution and into engagement 
with the envelope to both feed and print a postage value 
on the envelope, as it is fed downstream to the outfeed 
roller structure. And, in the "seal only" mode, the  
 
postage printing drum is not driven, but rather the 
envelope is fed downstream beneath the drum and thus 
directly to the outfeed roller structure. Since the 
postage printing drum is not driven into engagement with 
envelopes in the "seal only" mode of operation, such 
envelopes may not remain in contact with the deck as they 
are fed beneath the drum to the outfeed roller structure. 
Rather, such envelopes may become jammed against the 
outfeed roller structure. Accordingly, the postage 
printing drums of mailing machines have been equipped 
with envelope deflecting structures, including a spring 
loaded device which is fixedly attached to the postage 
printing drum so a to depend therefrom and into the path 
of travel of envelopes beneath the drum, to apply a 
normal, or hold down, force to the envelopes to ensure 
that

<CLAIMS>
A mailing machine comprising: 

(a) a base including a deck; 
(b) a postage meter removably mounted on the base, 
the postage meter including a rotary postage 

printing drum overhanging the deck; 
(c) the base including means for feeding an 
envelope in a downstream path of travel to the 

drum, the base including means for selectively 
driving the drum for printing postage on an 

envelope fed thereto; 
(d) envelope deflecting means including an elongate 
substantially rectangularly-shaped member 

having a predetermined length, the member 
including a substantially horizontally-extending 

first portion of the length thereof 
fixedly attached to the drum, the member 

including a second portion of the length 
thereof inclined downwardly from the first 

portion, the member including a third portion 
of the length thereof inclined upwardly from 

the second portion, the member including a 
fourth portion of the length thereof extending 

substantially horizontally from the third 
portion and disposed between and in sliding 

engagement with the drum and the first portion, 
and the second and third portions cooperatively 

defining a lower marginal peak edge overhanging 
the deck and extending transversely of the path 

of travel for urging an envelope fed beneath 
the drum into sliding engagement with the deck. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 1, wherein 
the member includes first means for hingedly connecting 

the first and second portions. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 2 wherein the 
member includes upper and lower surfaces, and the member 

including an elongate channel formed in the member from 
the upper surface thereof, and wherein the member is bent 

along the channel for resiliently urging the lower 
marginal peak edge toward the deck. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 1, wherein 
the member is molded from a resilient plastic material, 

and wherein the lower marginal peak edge resiliently 
urges an envelope fed therebeneath into sliding 

engagement with the deck. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 1, wherein 
the first portion includes an upper surface, the first 

portion including a cavity formed therein from the upper 
surface thereof, and the fourth portion slidably disposed 

within the cavity. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 5, wherein 
the fourth portion is substantially C-shaped, the fourth 

portion including a pair of oppositely spaced arm 
elements and a strut element extending therebetween, the 

first portion includes a lip edge element having a pair 
of slots formed therein at spaced intervals therealong, 

the arm elements slidably disposed within the slots, and 
the strut element slidably disposed within the cavity. 
The mailing machine according to Claim 6, wherein 
the strut element includes an elongate inner edge 

cooperative with the lip edge element for stopping 
slidable removal of the fourth portion from the first 

portion and thus from between the first portion and the 
drum.
