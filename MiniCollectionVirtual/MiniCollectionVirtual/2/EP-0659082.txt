<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of inhibiting the enzymatic metabolism of nitrogen substituted acridines comprising co-administering with the acridine an effective oxidase inhibiting amount of a P450 1A2 inhibitor. The oxidase is one whose activity is induced by beta-naphthaflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene, arochlor, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and isosafrole. The oxidase inhibitor may be a naphthyridine, a xanthine, a phenoxy amino alkane, a carbamoyl imidazole, a heterocyclic guanidine, a quinoline or a trifluoromethyl oxime ether.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with
nitrogen substituted acridines and, in particular,
their effect on cytochrome P450.Nitrogen substituted acridine have been
proposed for use in treatment of senile dementia such
as Alzheimer's disease. Such materials are described
in U.S. Patents 4,631,286; 4,695,573; 4,754,050;
4,816,456; 4,835,275; 4,839,364; 4,999,430; and
British Patent Appln. 2,091,249.Clinical studies have been performed on
patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease by
utilizing tacrine or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-acridinamine
monohydrate monohydrochloride (THA). Serum
determinations of patients given THA indicated the
very rapid formation of THA metabolites. It has also
been indicated that elevations of liver enzymes are 
found in some patients after THA administration, which
reportedly can be controlled by adjustment of
medication. W.K. Summers, T.H. Tachiki and A. Kling:
"Tacrine In The Treatment Of Alzheimer's Disease",
EUR. NEUROL. 29 (Supp. 3): 28-32 (1989). Various
metabolites of THA have been reported. C.A. Truman,

Chromatographic Characteristics of Metabolites of
Tacrine Hydrochloride in Human Serum and Urine with
those of In Vitro Metabolic Products From Hepatic
Microsomes", BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Vol. 42, no. 4, pp.
956-959 (1991). THA is extensively metabolized in
animals and man to several monohydroxy and dihydroxy
metabolites, some of which are excreted as glucuronide
derivatives.Monooxygenation of chemical materials has
been ascribed to cytochromes P450 (P450). These
hemoprotein containing monooxygenase enzymes
displaying a reduced carbon monoxide absorption
spectrum maximum near 450 nm have been shown to
catalyze a variety of oxidation reactions including
hydroxylation of endogenous and exogenous compounds.

been conducted on the mechanism's by which P450's can
catalyze oxygen transfer reactions. B. Testa and P.
