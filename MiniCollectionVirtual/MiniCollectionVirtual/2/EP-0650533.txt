<DESCRIPTION>
 METAL MATRIX COMPOSITEThe present invention relates to metal matrix composite materials and in particular to improvements in aluminium matrix alloys for such materialsMetal matrix composite materials comprising aluminium-copper- magnesium alloys which contain reinforcements of particulate silicon carbide are currently attracting a great deal of interest amongst aerospace manufacturers. Such materials have the potential to become widely adopted in applications where increased strength and stiffness are required in comparison to conventional aluminium alloys. However, one of the drawbacks of metal matrix composite materials is that a sufficient quantity of the reinforcing material must be incorporated to achieve significant weight savings or improvements in performance. Addition on this scale is apt to have an adverse effect on certain properties, notably toughness and ductility. Moreover, known composite materials of this type often exhibit a rapid natural ageing response following solution heat treatment, with the result that difficulties are encountered when post-form stretching techniques are used to make extruded product forms or the like.It is therefore an object of this invention to improve the fabricability of metal matrix composite materials.We have now discovered that the removal of magnesium from the matrix alloy of such materials leads to a surprising but significant improvement in fabricability. Metal matrix composites which use a magnesium-free matrix alloy are much easier to process and show a minimal natural ageing response over prolonged periods.According to the invention there is provided a metal matrix composite material comprising from 1 to 50% by weight of reinforcing material embedded in an alloy matrix, characterised in that the alloy matrix has the following composition in proportions by weight:copper 2 - 6% aluminium balance, save for incidental impurities, 

wherein the alloy matrix further comprises one of the grain refining additives from the group comprising zirconium, manganese or chromium in an amount up to 0. % by weight.The matrix alloy preferably contains from - 6% by weight of copper. Also, the proportion of grain refining additive is preferably from 0.05 to 0.2% by weight.In a particularly preferred form, the weight proportion of the reinforcing material is from 10 to 30%, more preferably from 1 to 25% and most especially from 18 to 22%. Suitable materials for the reinforcement include silicon carbide, alumina, boron, graphite, diamond and boron carbide. These may take
