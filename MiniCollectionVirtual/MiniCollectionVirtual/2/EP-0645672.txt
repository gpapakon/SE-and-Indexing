<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed of preparing washed silver halide 
photographic emulsions wherein silver halide grain formation is effected in 

the presence of an acid-coagulable gelatin derivative or a mixture of 
gelatin and an acid-coagulable gelatin derivative and coagulation of the 

emulsion occurs in the presence of ionic copolymers of styrene sulfonic 
acid and maleic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing washed 
silver halide photographic emulsions, and in particular to a method of 
preparing washed silver halide photographic emulsions by the coagulation 
washing method. Silver halide photographic emulsions are conventionally prepared 
by reacting an aqueous alkali metal halide or ammonium halide solution 
with an aqueous silver salt solution, e.g. silver nitrate, in the presence of a 
protective colloid, e.g. gelatin, to cause precipitation of small silver halide 
nuclei. After physical ripening to the desired average grain size, the 
emulsion is subjected to chemical ripening. At the conclusion of the physical ripening, the photographic 
emulsions contain soluble by-products and excess halides which should 
be removed. The soluble by-products and excess halides can be removed by 
chill-setting the emulsion, comminuting it into small fragments and 
washing by suspending in water, as illustrated in US Pat. Nos. 2,316,845 
and 3,396,027. Other methods include coagulation washing as illustrated 
in US Pat. Nos. 2,618,556, 2,614,928, 2,565,418, 3,241,969, 2,489,341, 
and in GB Pat. Nos. 1,305,409 and 1,167,159; centrifugation and 
decantation of the coagulated emulsion as illustrated in US Pat. Nos. 
2,463,794, 3,707,378, 2,996,278 and 3,489,454; employment of 
hydrocyclones alone or in combination with centrifuges as illustrated in 
GB Pat. Nos. 1,336,692 and 1,356,573; diafiltration with a semipermeable 
membrane as illustrated by Research Disclosure 10208, October 1972, 
Research Disclosure 13122, March 1975, DE Pat. Appl. No. 2,436,461,  
 
US Pat. No. 2,495,918, or with an ion-exchange resin as illustrated by US 
Pat. Nos. 3,782,953 and 2,827,428. Preferred methods of emulsion washing are those based on 
coagulation washing. Coagulation washing is based on the principle of 
causing the gelatin to coagulate so that it settles together with the silver 
halide grains and thus separates from the aqueous solution comprising 
the soluble by-products. The supernatant solution is decanted and the 
settled gelatin-silver halide complex is redispersed, after washing of the 
precipitate, in water or aqueous gelatin. The coagulation washing method 
offers a number of advantages; in particular, a high percentage of 
unwanted by-products can be removed in one stage, concentrated silver 
halide emulsions can be prepared, and the process is simple and 
inexpensive. Coagulation is conventionally effected by addition of 
inorganic electrolites, such as ammonium,

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a washed silver halide photographic 
emulsion comprising the steps of forming a dispersion of silver halide 

grains in the presence of a hydrophilic colloid and removing the 
undesirable by-products of silver halide grain-formation by lowering the 

pH to bring about coagulation and by washing the coagulum, the method 
being characterized by the fact that said hydrophilic colloid comprises an 

acid-coagulable gelatin derivative and said coagulation is effected in the 
presence of an ionic copolymer of styrene sulfonic acid and maleic acid. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the ionic copolymer of 
styrene sulfonic acid and maleic acid includes monomer units comprising: 

(a) a water-soluble salt of a styrene sulfonic acid, and 
(b) maleic acid, the molar ratio of (a) to (b) being at least 1:1 up to 9:1. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the ionic copolymer of 
styrene sulfonic acid and maleic acid comprises a copolymer of sodium 

styrene sulfonate and maleic acid in a 2:1 to 4:1 mole ratio. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein said gelatin derivative is 
phthaloyl gelatine. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein said gelatin derivative is 
phenylcarbamoyl gelatin. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein siad acid-coagulable 
gelatin derivative comprises at least 50% by weight of the hydrophilic 

colloid. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the pH to bring about 
coagulation is lowered to a value below 4. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the ionic copolymer of 
styrene sulfonic acid and maleic acid is added after silver halide 

grain-formation. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the ionic copolymer of 
styrene sulfonic acid and maleic acid is used in an amount comprised 

between about 5% and about 60% by weight relative to the amount of said 
gelatin derivative. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the washed coagulum 
is redispersed with water and hydrophilic colloid.
