to be connected to the distal portion of the femur 

and comprising two curved portions operating as a 
medial condyle and a side condyle,a tibial component 

to be connected to the proximal end of the tibia, 
with a flat top surface,and a tibial insert which can 

be engaged on the top surface to be movable with

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a full knee 
prosthesis. As is known,great problems are involved in 
making full knee prostheses,since has not been 
heretofore possible to provide prostheses adapted to 
precisely reproduce the main knee displacements,that 
is the rolling and rear sliding of the femural condyles 
on the tibia plate, with the possibility of allowing 
the tibia to rotate with respect to the mentioned femural 
condyles. Thus,prior full knee prostheses have not been 
practically broadly used,because of the great drawbacks 
brought to the deambulation. Accordingly,the aim of the present invention 
is to solve the above mentioned problem,by providing 
a full knee prosthesis which allows to reproduce the 
main functions of the knee articulation, during the 
knee bending operations and, more specifically, the rolling 
and rear sliding of the femural condyles,on the 
tibial plate portion, while allowing the tibia to  
 
rotate with respect to the femural condyles. Within the above aim,a main object of the 
present invention is to provide such a full knee 
prosthesis the component of which are so designed as 
to reduce to a minimum the wear thereof, owing to a 
perfect mutual fitting of all the articulation surfaces 
in all the assumed positions. Another object of the invention is to 
provide such a full knee prosthesis which affords a 
better distribution of the applied forces,so as to 
prevent localized stresses from occurring which would 
quickly deteriorate the materials of the prosthesis 
components with a consequent reduction of the prosthesis 
performance and safety. According to one aspect of the present 
invention,the above mentioned aim and objects,as well 
as yet other objects,which will become more apparent 
hereinafter,are achieved by a full knee prosthesis, 
characterized in that said prosthesis comprises: a femural 
component,which can be connected to the distal 
end of the femur and including two curved portions having 
the functions of medial condyle and side condyle,a  
 
tibial component,which can be coupled to the proximal 
end of the tibia,with a flat top surface,and a 
tibial insert which can be engaged on the top surface 
so as to be movable with respect to the tibial component,the 
tibial insert being provided at the top 
thereof with two concave surfaces which can be engaged 
by the two portions of the femur components. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will become more apparent hereinafter 
from the following detailed disclosure of a

A full knee prosthesis characterized in that 
said prosthesis comprises:a femural component,which 

can be connected to the distal end of the femur and 
including two curved portions having the functions 

of a medial condyle and a side condyle,a tibial component,which 
can be coupled to the proximal end of 

the tibia,with a flat top surface and a tibial insert 
which can be engaged on the top surface so as to be 

movable with respect to the tibial component,the 
tibial insert being provided at the top thereof with 

two concave surfaces which can be engaged by the two 
portions of the femur components. 
A prosthesis according to claim 1,characterized in 
that said femural component has convex outer surfaces 

precisely mating with the concave surfaces of the 
tibial insert. 
A prosthesis according to claims 1 and 2,characterized 
in that said prosthesis further comprises cylindric 

pins extending from the inner surface of the two portions. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said tibial 

component has,seen from the top,a substantially horseshoe 
configuration. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,characterized in that the top surface of 

the tibial component is polished by an end mirror-like 
polishing process. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,characterized in that said prosthesis further 

comprises a pin extending from a middle portion of the 
tibial component and engaging in a throughgoing slot 

provided through the tibial insert. 
A prosthesis according to one or more preceding 
claims,characterized in that said prosthesis further 

comprises a cylindric bush extending from the bottom 
face of the tibial component and that in said bush 

there is provided an axial threaded hole for screw 
engaging therein a plug or stabilizing element. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the precding 
claims,characterized in that said prosthesis further 

comprises radial legs extending from said cylindric 
bush. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that the bottom 

surface of the tibial component is rough so as to 
allow a bone integration. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that said tibial 

insert is provided,between the two concave surfaces, 
with a slot which can be engaged by the pin of the 

tibial component. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that said slot has a 

substantially circular shape. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that said slot has 

an elongated shape. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that,as said slot has 

an elongated shape,said tibial insert can be both rotated 
and translated with respect to said tibial component. 
Aprosthesis according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,characterized in that said prosthesis is 

moreover provided with an insert through a central portion 
of which there is provided a throughgoing slot the 

 
cross section of which narrows at the middle region 

because of the provision of a ridge,said slot having 
either a circular shape or an elongated shape. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that in said slot 

there is engaged the pin of the tibial component,whereas 
between the groove,the pin and the ridge of the tibial 

insert there occurs a cooperation preventing said tibial 
insert from disengaging in the axial direction,the 

cooperation between the pin and tibial insert preventing 
said tibial insert from being dislocated both in a 

front-rear direction and in a side-medial direction. 
A prosthesis according to one or more of the 
preceding claims,characterized in that from the central 

portion of the top surface there extends a cylindric 
pin in the top region of which there is formed a groove 

to allow said pin to cooperate with said tibial insert.
