<ABSTRACT>
A slant plate type compressor with a variable 
displacement mechanism includes a compressor housing (20) 

having a cylinder block (21) provided with a plurality of 
cylinders (70) and a crank chamber (22). A piston (71) is 

slidably fitted within each of the cylinders and is 
reciprocated by a drive mechanism. The drive mechanism 

includes a drive shaft (26) rotatably supported by the 
compressor housing, a cam rotor (40) fixed on the drive 

shaft and a slant plate (50) having a surface with an 
adjustable angle of inclination. The angle is controlled 

according to the pressure in the crank chamber. A wobble 
plate (60) is disposed adjacent the slant plate and 

converts the rotating motion of the drive shaft, the rotor 
and the slant plate into the reciprocating motion of the 

pistons which are coupled to the wobble plate through 
corresponding connecting rods (72). A hinged joint 

mechanism connects a steel arm portion (51) of the slant 
plate to cast iron arm portion (41) of the rotor to vary 

the angle of the slant plate. An abrasion preventing member 
(45) of steel has a flange (45a) disposed between the arm 

portion of the cam rotor and the arm portion of the slant 
plate so that abnormal abrasion of the frictional surface 

of the arm portion of the rotor can be effectively 
prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
refrigerant compressor and, more particularly, to a slant
plate type compressor, such as a wobble plate type
compressor with a variable displacement mechanism suitable
for use in an automotive air conditioning system.A slant plate type refrigerant compressor with a
variable displacement mechanism suitable for use in an
automotive air conditioning system is disclosed in JP-A-1-142277.
As disclosed there, the compression ratio of
the compressor may be controlled by changing the slant
angle of the sloping surface of the wobble plate. The slant
angle of the wobble plate is adjusted so as to maintain a
constant suction pressure in response to changes in the
pressure differential between the suction chamber and the
crank chamber.Referring to Figure 1, compressor 10 includes
cylindrical housing assembly 20 including cylinder block
21, front end plate 23 disposed at one end of cylinder
block 21, crank chamber 22 formed between cylinder block 21
and front end plate 23, and rear end plate 24 attached to
the other end of cylinder block 21. Front end plate 23 is
secured to one end of cylinder block 21 by a plurality of
bolts 101. Rear end plate 24 is secured to the opposite end
of cylinder block 21 by a plurality of bolts 102. Valve
plate 25 is disposed between rear end plate 24 and cylinder
block 21. Opening 231 is centrally formed in front end
plate 23 for supporting drive shaft 26 through bearing 30
disposed therein. The inner end portion of drive shaft 26
is rotatably supported by bearing 31 disposed within
central bore 210 of cylinder block 21. Bore 210 extends to
a rearward (to the right in Figure 1) end surface of
cylinder block 21 and houses valve control mechanism 19.Cam rotor 40 is fixed on drive shaft 26 by pin member
261 and rotates therewith. Thrust needle bearing 32 is 
disposed between the inner end surface of front end plate
23 and the adjacent axial end surface of cam rotor 40.
Slant plate 50 is disposed adjacent cam rotor 40 and
includes opening 53 through which drive shaft 26 passes.Referring to Figures 2 and 3 additionally, slant plate
50 includes arm 51 having a first and second axial end
surfaces 51a and 51b. Cam rotor 40 includes arm 41 which
includes first and second cylindrical projections 411 and
412 axially projecting from the opposite end surfaces of a
terminal end portion of arm 41. Hole 413 is axially bored
through the terminal end portion of arm 41. Pin member 42
includes shaft portion 42a and head portion 42b of which
the diameter is

<CLAIMS>
A slant plate type compressor comprising a compressor
housing (20) which encloses a crank chamber (22), a suction

chamber (241) and a discharge chamber (251); the housing

having a cylinder block (21) with a plurality of cylinders
(70) formed therethrough; a piston (71) slidably fitted

within each of the cylinders; a driving means coupled to
the pistons for reciprocating the pistons within the

cylinders, the driving means including a drive shaft (26)
rotatably supported in the housing, a cam rotor (40)

fixedly connected to the drive shaft, a coupling means for
drivingly coupling the cam rotor to the pistons such that

rotary motion of the cam rotor is converted into
reciprocating motion of the pistons, the coupling means

including a slant plate (50) having a surface disposed at
an inclination relative to a plane perpendicular to the

drive shaft, the angle of inclination of the slant plate
being adjustable to vary the capacity of the compressor;

and capacity control means (193) for adjusting the angle of
inclination and including a passageway (195) formed in the

housing and linking the crank chamber and the suction
chamber in fluid communication; the cam rotor being coupled

to the slant plate by means of a hinge mechanism so as to
allow the inclining motion of the slant plate, the hinge

mechanism including a cast iron first arm (41) portion
formed on the cam rotor and a steel second arm portion (51)

formed on the slant plate, the second arm portion
comprising a slot through which a steel pin member (42)

passes, and the pin member being slidable along the slot
and fixedly connected to the first arm portion;

characterised by an annular cylindrical member (45) which
is loosely mounted about the pin member (42) and is loosely

received in the slot (52), the annular cylindrical member
including an annular flange (45a) radially extending from

one axial end thereof so as to be loosely disposed between 
the first and second arm portions (41,51) to inhibit

abrasion thereof.
