<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing an imagewise exposed 
photographic silver halide colour material by a redox 

amplification method in which the colour material is 
treated with a colour developing agent in the presence 

of an oxidant
 

   in which a processor is used which comprises 
means for applying a relatively small volume of 

processing solution (4) to an imagewise exposed silver 
halide material and in which the relatively small 

volume of solution is supplied from a reservoir (7) of 
relatively large volume and, while processing, the 

processing solution being used is isolatable from said 
reservoir and,

 
   wherein either a colour developer solution 

without oxidant or an oxidant solution without colour 
developing agent is held in the reservoir and

 
   wherein the additional oxidant (or colour 

developing agent) respectively needed for 
amplification is introduced into the processing 

solution while it is isolated from said reservoir and
 

   wherein the used developer/amplifier so-formed 
is discarded into said reservoir after use where any 

unused introduced oxidant (or colour developing agent) 
is destroyed by a compound present in the reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photographic processing
and, in particular, to a method of processing
photographic paper materials.Redox amplification processes have been
described, for example in British Specification Nos.
1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In
such processes colour materials are developed to
produce a silver image (which may contain only small
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier)
to form a dye image.The developer-amplifier solution contains a
colour developing agent and an oxidising agent which
will oxidise the colour developing agent in the
presence of the silver image which acts as a catalyst.Oxidised colour developer reacts with a colour
coupler to form the image dye. The amount of dye
formed depends on the time of treatment or the
availability of colour coupler and is less dependent
on the amount of silver in the image as is the case in
conventional colour development processes.Examples of suitable oxidising agents include
peroxy compounds including hydrogen peroxide and
compounds which provide hydrogen peroxide, e.g.
addition compounds of hydrogen peroxide; cobalt (III)
complexes including cobalt hexammine complexes; and
periodates. Mixtures of such compounds can also be
used.It is well-known to use rotating drums in
photographic processing apparatus. Such machines may
comprise a horizontally mounted rotatable drum having 
a textured stainless steel surface whose lower surface
dips into the processing solution held in a tray-like
container. In a hand-operated drum processor each
processing solution is poured into the container and
then discarded by tipping the tray when the particular
processing step has been carried out for the necessary
length of time.US-A-4 613 223 discloses a more mechanised
embodiment in which a flexible sheet of photographic
material is driven along an endless curved path within
a processing tank by passing the sheet through nips
formed between at least one pair of driven rollers.
At least one of the driven rollers is the drum itself.
During processing, the emulsion (sensitive) surface of
the sheet is arranged not to come into contact with
any stationary part of the processing vessel as it is
being processed. This prevents damage to the surface
during processing. After driving the sheet around the
endless path for a predetermined number of cycles,
which defines the processing time, the sheet is then
directed out of the processing tank.A solution containing both an oxidant and a
colour

A method of processing an imagewise exposed

amplification method in which the colour material is
treated with a colour developing agent in the presence

of an oxidant

A method as claimed in any of claims 1-8 in
which the photographic material has been soaked in a
