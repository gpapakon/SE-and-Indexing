<ABSTRACT>
The color of hydrocarbon resins having carbon-carbon 
double bonds and containing color bodies is lightened by a 

hydrotreating process comprising the single step of 
contacting the resin with hydrogen in the presence of a 

catalyst that promotes the hydrogenation of the color bodies 
without substantially changing the content of carbon-carbon 

double bonds in the resin. The preferred catalysts are 
copper chromite and copper/zinc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for lightening the color of resins and to resins produced by this process.Methods for hydrogenating hydrocarbon resins to lighten the color are well known and generally produce a product
that is "water white" in color. The aliphatic and/or aromatic unsaturation present in the resin is partially or completely
eliminated, providing a product with improved oxidative stability, UV resistance and color stability. However, particularly
in the case of resins derived from aromatic feedstreams, hydrogenation also alters the physical properties of the resin,
which can make it less desirable for use in products such as adhesives, caulks and sealants, plastic and rubber modifiers,
and printing inks. It would be advantageous to reduce the color of a resin without changing its other desirable
physical characteristics.U.S. Patent 5,171,793 discloses the preparation of heat-stable, light colored resins by hydrogenation of resins
produced by thermally polymerizing a feedstock containing a vinyl aromatic component, a cyclodiene component and
optionally an acyclic diene component. The resin solution that results from the thermal polymerization is stripped to a
softening point of 80°-200°C before hydrogenation. The hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of (1) a hydrogenation
catalyst selected from Group VIII metals, Group VI metals and Group VII metals, which may be activated or
carried on a support; (2) a solvent diluent, and (3) an olefinic diluent. Chromophores and double bonds in the resin
molecule are hydrogenated. U.S. Patent 2,963,467 discloses a process for making light colored hydrocarbon resins
with a softening point above 85°C by hydrogenating in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel, reduced nickel, nickel
sulfide, copper chromite, copper molybdate, and molybdenum disulfide. However, the process also requires initial
stripping of the polymerized resin to at least a 100°C softening point, followed by redissolving the resin in a diluent,
and stripping the hydrogenated product at low temperatures and underreduced pressure.. The process of this invention for lightening the color of hydrocarbon resins of a weight average molecular weight
of 250 to 10 000 having carbon-carbon double bonds and containing color bodies is characterized by the single step
of contacting a noncrystalline hydrocarbon resin with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group
consisting of copper chromite and copper/zinc
that promotes the hydrogenation of the color bodies,
