<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reagent for detecting malaria
infected cells and a detecting method for malaria infected
cells using the reagent by which malaria infected cells,
in particular malaria infected erythrocytes, can be stained
rapidly and specifically.When a living body is infected by malaria or Plasmodium,
malaria enters into erythrocytes and grows. To detect
malaria infected erythrocytes is an effective method for
examining the possibility of the malaria infection.Conventional methods for detecting malaria infected
erythrocytes are as follows.In one known method, malaria infected erythrocytes are
detected by staining a blood smear by Giemsa stain and
observing it with a microscope (see, for example, Toshio
Nakamura et al., "An Examination Method for Plasmodium", 
Rinsho Kensa, Vol. 23, No.4: 335-341, 1979).
Another known method is that blood smear is stained with a
fluorescent dye and observed with a fluorescent microscope
to detect malaria infected erythrocytes (see Humihiko Kawamotor
"Simple and Rapid Staining for Diagnosis of Protozoal
Infection with Fluorechromes", Rinsho Kensa, Vol. 32, No.7:
803-806, 1988).However, these methods are troublesome due to the
necessity of steps for preparing, drying, fixing, and staining
a blood smear, and also need a skilled technique for
distinguishing malaria infected erythrocytes from erythrocytes
which are not infected. Further, the microscoplic
observation takes a long time (generally more than 15
minutes).A method for detecting malaria infected erythrocytes by
using a flow cytometry has been also developed. In this
method, malaria infected erythrocytes are stained with a
fluorescent dye and detected by a flow cytometry. The
mechanism of this method is that Plasmodium is stained with
a fluorescent dye and fluoresces irradiating by an argon
laser, whereby detecting malaria infected erythrocytes.
Various methods using the above mechanism are known as
follows. 
(1) J. W. Jacobberger, "Analysis of Plasmodium-Infected
Blood by Flow Cytometry", Cytometry, Vol.4: 228-237, 1983
In this method, malaria infected erythrocytes are
detected by a flow cytometry, using 3,3'-dimethyloxacarbocyanine:
DiOC1 (3) as a fluorescent dye. Figure 7 of this
document shows that the distribution of reticulocytes
(Immature RBC: imRBC) and malaria infected erythrocytes
(pRBC, ppRBC) are overlapped. Further, Figure 2 is a photograph
showing that the reticulocytes (imRBC) and malaria
infected erythrocytes (pRBC, ppRBC) fluoresces by staining
with DiOC1 (3).(2) M. T. Makler et al.,
