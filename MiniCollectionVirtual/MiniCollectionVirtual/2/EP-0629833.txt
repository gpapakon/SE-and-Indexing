<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine frame, and 
particularly but not exclusively, to a machine frame for 

so-called coordinate measuring machines of the kind which 
include at least one first portal which comprises two 

parallel, vertical first and second legs (7, 8) which are 
rotationally and flexurally rigid in relation to a base 

member (10) and which support a horizontal beam (11) on 
which there is movably supported a rod, bar or the like for 

supporting a measuring head, tool or corresponding device. 
According to the invention, the horizontal beam (11) is 

connected to the first leg (8) by means of a pivot joint 
(13) which permits the beam (11) to rotate in the vertical 

plane of the legs (7, 8), and is connected to the second 
leg (7) by means of a connection (14) which permits the 

beam (11) to rotate in this vertical plane and also to move 
in the direction of its longitudinal axis in relation to 

the second leg. 
 
The invention also relates to a method of determining the 
geometry of the portal occasioned by deformation of such 

machine frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine frame and
particularly but not exclusively, to a frame structure for
so-called coordinate measuring machines, comprising at
least one first portal which includes two parallel vertical
first and second legs, of which the first leg is rotationally
and flexurally rigid in relation to a base member, a
horizontal beam carried by said legs, and a rod or bar
which is carried by the horizontal beam and which movably
supports a measuring head or a tool, the horizontal beam
being connected to the first leg by means of a pivot
connection which permits the beam to rotate in the vertical
plane of the legs. The invention also relates to a method
for determining portal geometry using such a machine frame.Coordinate measuring machines are used to measure-up the
shape of objects, wherein a large number of points on the
object are measured up with regard to their position in a
three-dimensional coordinate system, which is defined by
the machine. A coordinate measuring machine comprises a
measuring head which can be moved in three directions which
extend at right angles to one another. The measuring head
carries a measuring probe whose position relative to a
surface of the object is determined in a coordinate system
which is defined by the aforesaid three mutually perpendicular
directions. Such coordinate measuring machines are
highly accurate in operation and consequently any deformation
in the various parts of the machine will influence the
measuring result.Traditionally, endeavours have been made to solve this
problem by constructing the machine frame from highly rigid
and firmly connected components so that any deformations
that occur can be ignored. Because of the precision
required of such machines in present times, a solution of 
this nature results in bulky and extremely expensive
constructions.SE-B-468,727 disclosing a machine frame of the kind defined
in the introduction, and US-A-5,119,566 teach other solutions
to this problem. These solutions are based on the
principle of allowing certain deformations in the machine
frame but to construct the frame in a manner which will
enable these deformations to be readily calculated and the
measuring result corrected on the basis of calculated
deformations.The present invention is also concerned with solving the
problem of the effect that deformation of the frame has on
the measuring result, by constructing the frame in a manner
which will enable deformations to be measured and calculated
more easily than in the case of earlier
