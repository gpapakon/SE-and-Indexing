<ABSTRACT>
We have discovered that coherent variation of at least two laser 
parameters can result in improved device performance, e.g., in pure amplitude or 

frequency modulation at frequencies substantially above 1 GHz, or in previously 
unattainable modulation frequencies. Among the relevant laser parameters are 

pumping rate, optical gain coefficient, photon lifetime, confinement factor, effective 
carrier temperature, output frequency and spontaneous emission factor. 

Exemplarily, the pumping rate and the optical gain are coherently varied such that 
the output radiation is free of chirp, or the output frequency and the effective carrier 

temperature are coherently varied such that the output radiation has constant 
amplitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application pertains to an article (e.g., a communication or data
processing system) that comprises a semiconductor laser and to a method of
operating the article that comprises high frequency modulation of the laser output.Semiconductor lasers are well known. High-frequency modulation of
the output radiation of semiconductor laser is an active area of optoelectronics. At
present, amplitude modulation (AM) is the most widely used scheme. The
conventional method of modulating the output amplitude of a semiconductor laser
involves varying the laser pumping rate, by varying either electrical pump current or
pump photon flux. This method is simple but is known to be limited to relatively
low frequencies, typically ≲ 10 GHz. Furthermore, for modulation frequencies
≳ 1 GHz, the conventional modulation method is plagued by oscillations in the
wavelength of the dominant mode of the output radiation. This phenomenon is
generally referred to as "chirp". Both of the above referred to shortcomings of the
conventional modulation method are due to an intrinsic resonance in the nonlinear
laser system, the electron-photon resonance.An alternative method for modulating the laser output is to directly
control by external means the gain coefficient associated with the laser cavity. See,
for instance, U.S. patent 5,023,878, which discloses a semiconductor laser which
comprises, in addition to a "gain" section, a "loss" section that is optically coupled to
the gain section but is electrically substantially isolated therefrom, such that the
modal gain of the laser cavity can be changed through change of the electrical bias
on the loss section.Recently, a different and novel method of varying the gain coefficient
associated with the active medium was disclosed. The method involves varying the
effective carrier temperature Te in the laser active region. V. B. Gorfinkel et al.,
InternationalJournalofMillimeterandInfraredWaves, Vol. 12, p. 649 (1991)
disclose heating the electrons in the active region by driving an electric current
through the active region, and V. B. Gorfinkel et al., AppliedPhysics Letters,
Vol. 60, p. 3141 (1992) disclose heating by inducing intersubband absorption in
quantum wells in the active region. See also EP-A-0549132, which inter alia
discloses an optical modulator that utilizes carrier heating by means of intersubband
absorption. High frequency modulation of Te by several tens of degrees has been 
demonstrated experimentally.Although the method of varying Te in principle allows faster laser
modul
