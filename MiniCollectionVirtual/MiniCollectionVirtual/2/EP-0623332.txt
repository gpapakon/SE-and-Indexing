<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an absorbent product in which pressure sensitive adhesive 
is used to attach the product to a user's undergarment. The product does not 

require release paper to protect the adhesive from unintended contact prior 
to use. The product is made by forming depressions (9) in a fluid impervious 

barrier (11) so as to create raised areas (4) in the barrier that protect 
the adhesive (10). The depressions may be formed in the garment facing 

surface of the barrier and the adhesive applied within the depressions so 
that the raised areas adjacent the depressions protect the adhesive. 

Alternatively, the depressions (16) may be formed in the surface of the 
barrier opposite the garment facing surface so as to create raised areas (16) 

in the garment facing surface and the adhesive (10) applied adjacent the 
raised areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention is directed to absorbent
products such as panty liners, sanitary napkins, incontinence
pads and the like. More specifically, the current
invention is directed to a method of making an absorbent
product having positioning adhesive that is integrally
protected by the garment facing surface of the product,
thereby eliminating the need for release paper.Traditionally, absorbent products such as panty
liners, sanitary napkins and incontinence pads have
been held in place by pressure sensitive adhesive, typically
a double sided tape or a hot melt type glue, disposed
on the garment facing side of the pad. The
pressure sensitive adhesive holds the pad in place by
adhering it to the crotch of the wearer's undergarment.
The pressure sensitive adhesive is covered with release
paper that protect the adhesive from dirt and unintended
adhesion during manufacture, packaging and
storage. Typically, the release paper has been coated
on one side with a coating, which may be silicone, that
reduces the adherency to the adhesive of the coated
side of the release paper.Since the release paper must be removed by
the user just prior to application of the product to an
undergarment, its presence creates waste and complicates
the utilization of the product. One approach for
dispensing with the release paper, disclosed in U.S Patent
No. 4,475,913 (Hlaban), involves folding an absorbent
batt along its longitudinal edges so as to create soft
edges for the product. In so doing, a centrally disposed
cavity is formed that extends the length of the product.
A baffle, supplied in fluid form, is then extruded into the
cavity so as to conform to it and a pressure sensitive
adhesive is deposited onto the portion of the baffle
within the cavity. According to this reference, no release
paper is need because the adhesive is shielded by the
walls of the cavityUnfortunately, this approach suffers from a
variety of drawbacks. First, the manufacturing process
is complex -- the edges must be folded and maintained
in place during extrusion of the baffle, the amount of film
extruded must be carefully controlled, and the cavity
shape must be maintained in the extruded film. Second,
the folding creates a thick, bulky product, whereas many
users prefer a thin, less obtrusive product. Third, the
cavity will generally be relatively deep, since its walls
are substantially the thickness of the absorbent batt.
Such depth will make it difficult for a user to bring the
adhesive into contact with the under-garment unless the
cavity is

A method of applying and protecting positioning
adhesive (10) on an absorbent article (1) having a

fluid impervious barrier (6) having a first surface
forming a garment facing surface (4) of such article

and a second surface (11) opposite said first surface
(4), comprising the steps of:


a) deforming portions of said barrier (6) so as
to form a plurality of depressions (17) in a pattern

on said second surface (11) of said barrier
(6) so as to form a corresponding raised area

(16) in said first surface (4) of said barrier (6)
opposite each of said depressions (17);
b) depositing an adhesive (10) onto said raised
areas (16); and
c) inverting each of said depressions (17) and
said raised areas (16) so as to form adhesive

(10) containing depressions (9) in said first surface
(4) of said barrier (6) and raised areas in

said second surface (11).
The method according to claim 1, where the step
of inverting said raised areas (16) comprises the

step of applying a vacuum thereto.
A method of applying and protecting positioning
adhesive on an absorbent article (1) having a fluid

impervious barrier (6) having a first surface forming
a garment facing surface (4) of such article (1) and

a second surface (11) opposite said first surface,
comprising the steps of:


transferring said adhesive (10) from a reservoir
onto a release surface in a pattem, said adhesive

(10) capable of bonding to said barrier (6)
with greater tenacity than to said release surface;
transferring said adhesive (10) from said
release surface onto said first surface (4) of

said barrier (6) in said pattern; and then
deforming portions of said barrier (6) so as to
form a plurality of depressions (9) in said pattern

on said first surface (4) of said barrier (6)
so as to form a corresponding raised area in

said second surface (11) of said barrier (6)
opposite each of said depressions (9);

wherein said adhesive (10) is located in said 
depressions (9).
The method according to claim 3, wherein the step
of transferring said adhesive (10) from said reservoir

onto said release surface comprises printing
said adhesive in said second pattern onto a first belt

(18).
The method according to claim 4, wherein the step
of transferring said adhesive (10) from said reservoir

onto said release surface further comprises
transferring said adhesive (10) in said pattern from

said first belt (18) onto a second belt (19) on which
said release surface is formed.
The method according to claim 3, wherein the step
of forming said plurality of depressions (17) in said

barrier (6) is performed after said adhesive has
been transferred to said barrier (6).
