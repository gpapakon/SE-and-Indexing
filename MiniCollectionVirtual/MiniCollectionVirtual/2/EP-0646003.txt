Process for the preparation of a dispersible colloidal 
system based on cyclodextrin in the form of nanospheres, 

characterised in that 

1) a liquid phase is prepared which comprises a solution 
of cyclodextrin modified by acyl groups in an organic 

solvent or mixture of organic solvents which is (are) 
selected from among methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and 

acetone, which may or may not contain a surfactant and 
which is capable of accepting an active molecule, 
2) a second liquid phase is prepared which comprises 
water or an aqueous mixture, which may or may not 

contain a surfactant and which is capable of accepting 
an active molecule, and 
3) one of the liquid phases obtained under (1) or (2) is 
added to the other, with sufficient stirring 

maintained to homogenise the mixture of the phases (1) 
and (2), such as to obtain immediately a colloidal 

suspension of modified cyclodextrin nanospheres where 
appropriate containing the said active molecule. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that all or 
part of the solvent or mixture of solvents and of the water or 

aqueous mixture is removed such as to obtain a colloidal 
suspension of the desired nanosphere concentration or to obtain 

a nanosphere powder. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
said solvent of the phase (1) is selected from among alcohols and 

ketones or mixtures thereof. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
modified β-cyclodextrin is a β-cyclodextrin which is acylated by 

an aliphatic or aromatic acyl group.  
 
Process according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
modified cyclodextrin is a beta-cyclodextrin which is esterified 

by alkanoyl groups having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
modified cyclodextrin is a beta-cyclodextrin esterified by 

alkanoyl groups having 6 to 14 carbon atoms. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the active molecule is a medicinal active principle or a 

medicinal precursor for human or veterinary use, a biological 
reagent or a cosmetic principle, a virus, a constituent of a 

virus, bacterium or cell, an antigen, an allergen or an enzyme. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the volumetric ratio of phase (1)/phase (2) is from 0.1 to 

1. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
water is removed in its entirety by lyophilisation. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that the surfactant(s) is (are) present in a proportion of from 

0.1 to 10 wt-%, preferably from 0.2 to 2 wt-%, of the colloidal 
suspension obtained in stage 3. 
Use of the nanospheres of modified cyclodextrin exhibiting 
a diameter within the range 90 to 900 nm obtained in accordance 

with one of Claims 1 to 10 as vectors of medicinal or cosmetic 
active principles. 
Use of the nanospheres of modified cyclodextrin exhibiting 
a diameter within the range 90 to 900 nm obtained in accordance 

with one of Claims 1 to 10 as vectors of chemicals.
