<ABSTRACT>
The tangential separator is intended for separating tobacco (50), when it enters a cigarette-making machine, from the air which has been used to transport it. It comprises a suction drum (2) consisting of two concentric cylinders (20, 21) separated by a plurality of suction chambers (23), the inner cylinder (21) being arranged so that the air is sucked in in a variable manner along a generatrix of the said cylinder. In this way, the distribution of tobacco inside the cigarette-making machine is more uniform and the strands of tobacco suffer less damage. Moreover, the hollow inner part (25) of the inner cylinder is connected at its two ends to extraction orifices each equipped with a member for regulating the flow of air (43), making it possible to balance the exit flows of air and, consequently, to better distribute the tobacco inside the separator. Such a device is particularly suitable for a wide separator.

Tangential separator intended to separate shreds of 
tobacco to be used in a machine for manufacturing articles 

of the tobacco industry, air having served to convey it to 
said separator, including a suction drum (2) comprising two 

air-exhaust orifices (41), disposed along a longitudinal 
axis of said drum, the air being exhausted in opposite 

directions through each of said orifices, said drum being 
made up of two coaxial cylindrical elements of circular 

cross-section (20, 21), the outer cylindrical element (20) 
being made up of a wire netting and being connected to the 

inner cylindrical element (21) by a plurality of solid 
walls (22) disposed radially and defining among them a 

plurality of suction chambers (23), the wall of each 
suction chamber constituted by the cylindrical segment 

forming part of the inner cylindrical element, comprising a 
plurality of holes (2
4; 24A) disposed longitudinally along 
a generatrix of said inner cylindrical segment,
 
   characterized in that
 
   said holes are distributed in an irregular way so that 

the air flow increases starting from the center toward the 
ends of the inner cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said holes have a cross-section increasing 

starting from the center toward the ends of the inner 
cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said holes are of circular cross-section, 

their diameter increasing starting from the center toward 
the ends of the inner cylindrical element.  

 
Tangential separator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said holes are of uniform circular cross-section, 

their spacing decreasing starting from the center 
toward the ends of the inner cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said holes are in the form of elongated 

slots, their length increasing starting from the center 
toward the ends of the inner cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said holes are made up of two openings 

(24A) made over the whole periphery of two portions of the 
inner cylindrical element disposed on each side of a central 

portion (21A) of said cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the two said exhaust 

orifices are each connected to one end of the hollow interior 
part (25) of said inner cylindrical element. 
Tangential separator according to claim 7, characterized 
in that each of said exhaust orifices includes an 

air-flow regulating component (43). 
Tangential separator according to claim 8, characterized 
in that said air-flow regulating components are 

controlled differentially.
