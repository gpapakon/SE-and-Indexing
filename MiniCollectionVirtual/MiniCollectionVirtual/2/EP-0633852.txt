<ABSTRACT>
Shock-absorbing and sprung suspension arrangement (11) for supporting a vehicle cab via a lockable coupling arrangement (19). This couples together the vehicle cab with the suspension arrangement. The coupling arrangement is formed of both a first coupling part (20) attached to the vehicle cab and a second coupling part (19) attached to the suspension arrangement with a lock mechanism for releasable locking of the coupling parts to each other. The second coupling part (19) is connected with the suspension arrangement both via a spring element (60) in the shock absorber's (1) upper fastening (18/58) and via a carrier member (50) which is separate from said fastening and which is arranged in the upper end of the spring (2). This is arranged to take the static load acting on the suspension arrangement and thereby statically unload the shock absorber's upper fastening. Its spring member can thereby be given a well-adapted stiffness which imparts high-grade vibration-isolation characteristics to the suspension arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a shock-absorbing and sprung 
suspension arrangement comprising at least one shock 
absorber and one spring for each suspension location, 
whereby the shock absorber and the spring are coupled 
parallel to each other between a lower part such as a 
chassis which supports the suspension and an upper part 
such as a vehicle cab which is sprung-supported and shock-absorbingly-supported 
by means of the suspension arrangement, 
whereby the shock absorber presents a lower fastening 
for connection to said lower part and an upper fastening 
for damped connection to said upper part, said upper part 
presenting a spring member and said suspension arrangement 
additionally being provided with a lockable coupling 
arrangement for releasable coupling of the vehicle cab to 
the suspension arrangement such that the vehicle cab is 
supported by one or more suspension arrangements via the 
coupling arrangement which consists of both a first 
coupling part attached to said upper part and of a second 
coupling part attached to the suspension arrangement with 
a lock mechanism for releasable locking of the coupling 
parts to each other, said second coupling part being 
connected to the suspension arrangement both via said 
spring element in the shock absorber's upper fastening and 
via a carrier member which is separate from said fastening 
and which is arranged in the upper end of the spring, said 
carrier member being arranged to take the static load 
acting on the suspension arrangement and thereby statically 
unload the shock absorber's upper fastening, the spring 
member of which can thereby be given a well-adapted 
stiffness which imparts high-grade vibration-isolation 
characteristics to the suspension arrangement.  
 For the suspension of e.g. a truck cab on a chassis, a 
combination of springs and shock absorbers is normally used 
whereby the spring's upper fastening is connected to the 
upper part of the shock absorber. The cab is normally fixed 
to this by means of a rubber bush. In order that the shock 
absorber can support the static load, i.e. the intrinsic 
weight of the cab, the bush has to be designed for this 
load bearing function. This means in practice that the bush 
has to be given a very high stiffness. Even if a bush with 
low stiffness is chosen, which can be obtained e.g. by 
using a low rubber hardness, the risk is still present that 
the bush will set after a time and still obtain a high 
stiffness. The disadvantage with these known, stiff, static 
load-bearing
