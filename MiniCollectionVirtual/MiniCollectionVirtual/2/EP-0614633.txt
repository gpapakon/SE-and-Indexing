<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for adjusting the position of a 
backrest (24) 

relative to a chair seat (20). The backrest (24) includes an 
elongated stem (30) having a curved 

lower portion (32). Preferably, a spring (58) operably engages the 
stem (30) to bias it in an 

upward direction. A housing (28) is adapted to slidably receive the 
curved portion (32) of 

the stem (30) and guide the spring. A latch mechanism (62,34) is adapted 
to engage the stem (30) 

to lock the backrest  (24) in a desired position, and an actuator 
member (66) is adapted to 

move the latch mechanism (62,34) between an engaged and disengaged 
position. In 

operation, the latch mechanism (62,34) is disengaged to allow the 
backrest stem (30) to move 

in a curvilinear path to a desired height and corresponding angular 
position, and 

reengaged to lock the backrest stem (30) in said position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to office chairs, and more
particularly, to an apparatus for adjusting the position of a backrest relative to the
seat of an office chair.Many office chairs have backrests which can be adjusted in height
or angle relative to a seat. It is also desirable to adjust both the height and the
angle of a backrest so that the position of the backrest corresponds to the natural
position of a user's back when the user is in a desired forward or reclined
position. When a user reclines or leans forward, the torso generally pivots about
an axis through the hip joints of the user. Thus, it is desirable to provide a
backrest with a path of movement corresponding to the pivotal movement of the
user's back.Chairs having a mechanism for adjusting both the height and angle
of a backrest are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 1,927,491 to Gabb and 3,351,379
to Street. The patent to Gabb discloses a back rest slidably accommodated in a
two-part clamp carried by a link pivotally connected to the seat. The clamp is
operable by means of a hand screw member which maintains support both with
respect to its vertical and angular adjustment by cooperation with an arcuate-shaped
fixed abutment associated with the seat frame.The patent to Street discloses a similar mechanism including an
integral portion of a seat frame provided with inner and outer cylindrically convex
regions complementary to concave faces of a block. To adjust both the angle and
height of the backrest assembly in relation to the seat frame assembly, a hand 
piece is rotated to allow disengagement of the complementary serrated parts and
permit angular movement together of the block and stem of a backrest in relation
to a seat frame.Another type of backrest adjustment mechanism is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 910,357 to Case. The patent to Case discloses a seat frame provided
with a back bracket which is formed with a T-shaped slide channel that extends
longitudinally backward and upward along the arc of a circle. The lower end of a
backrest shank is curved downward and forward to fit and slide longitudinally in
the channel of the back bracket. To limit upward movement of the shank in the
channel, a spring-latch is provided in the shank which is adapted to normally enter
and operate in a small longitudinal groove in the channel. To lock the shank at
any desired position, a wedge block is located in a recess in one side of the
concave face of the shank. The block is adapted to be forced toward the adjoining
wall of the slide channel

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for adjusting the position of a
backrest (24) relative to a chair seat (20)

comprising:

said backrest (24) including an elongated stem
(30) having a curved lower portion (32) that curves

along an arc having a center defined by a horizontal
line approximately through the hip joints of a user

sitting in the chair seat;
a spring (58) operably engaging the stem (30) to
bias said stem in an upward direction:
a housing (28) adapted to slidably receive the
curved portion (32) of the stem (30) and guide the

spring (58);
a latch mechanism (62, 34) adapted to lock the
lower portion (32) of the stem in a plurality of fixed

desired positions within the housing (28), said latch
mechanism (62, 34) comprising a rack (34) on the lower

portion of the stem and a pawl (62) adapted to
operably engage the rack;
an actuator member (66) adapted to move the latch
mechanism (62, 34) between an engaged and disengaged

position; and

   whereby disengagement of the latch mechanism (62,
34) allows the backrest stem (30) to move in a

curvilinear path to a desired height and corresponding
angular position for the backrest (24) and whereupon

reengagement of the latch mechanism (62, 34) locks the

backrest stem (30) in said position.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said
housing (28) has an aperture for slidably receiving

the curved portion (32) of the stem and a cavity (46)
therein for accommodating said curved portion (32),
 
   and wherein said latch mechanism (62, 34) is

positioned within the housing cavity.
The apparatus of claims 1 or 2 wherein the
rack (34) has a width greater than the curved lower

portion (32) of the stem and the cavity (46) has a
greater width than the aperture, wherein the rack (34)

slidably fits within the cavity (46) and the stem
slidably fits within the aperture, the width of the

rack (34) being greater than the width of the aperture
in the housing (29) to provide an uppermost stop for

adjusting the backrest.
