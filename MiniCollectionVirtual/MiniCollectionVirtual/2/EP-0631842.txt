<ABSTRACT>
A grinding machine of the sort including at least one grinding wheel (12) which is mounted so that it can rotate on a frame, a rocker (14) which is mounted so that it can pivot on this frame about an axis (A2) parallel to the axis of rotation (A1) of the grinding wheel (12), a support spindle (15) which is mounted so that it can rotate on the rocker (14) about an axis (A3) itself also parallel to the axis of rotation (A1) of the grinding wheel (12), and which is designed to receive axially, on the one hand, the spectacle lens (glass) (10) for grinding and, on the other hand, a template (16) and, located vertically below the template (16), a contact detector (17). According to the invention, the contact detector (17) is formed, on the one hand, of a rigid key (23) and, on the other hand, of a tactile sensor (24) duly attached to the rigid key (23) on its surface. Application to the edging (edge trimming) of spectacle lenses.
