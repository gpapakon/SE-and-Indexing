<ABSTRACT>
This multi-cylinder, four-stroke internal combustion engine has spark ignition and comprises three inlet valves and one exhaust valve, which interact with valve openings in the combustion space which have valve-opening centres. The valve-opening centres are situated on both sides of a central longitudinal plane of the internal combustion engine. The valves are arranged in such a way that a first inlet valve and a second inlet valve are situated with their valve-opening centres on one side of the central longitudinal plane whereas a third inlet valve and the exhaust valve are situated with their valve-opening centres on the other side of the central longitudinal plane.

<CLAIMS>
A four-stroke internal-combustion engine with at least one row of cylinders with three
intake valves and one exhaust valve per cylinder, wherein the said valves are actuated by

camshafts arranged in a cylinder head and act with valve discs upon valve openings of a
combustion chamber which have different diameters and the centres of which are situated

on both sides of a median longitudinal plane, and wherein the valves (15, 16, 17, 18) are
arranged in such a way that the centres (33, 34) of the valve openings (25, 26) of the first

intake valve (15) and of the second intake valve (16) are situated on one side 
SR
 of the
median longitudinal plane 
B-B
, whereas the centres (35, 36) of the valve openings (27,
28) of the third intake valve (17) and of the exhaust valve (18) are situated on the other

side 
SL
 of the median longitudinal plane 
B-B
, 
characterized in that
 the third intake
valve (17) is actuated continuously during the operation of the internal-combustion

engine (1), and the first intake valve (15) and the second intake valve (16) can be
brought into operation by means of switching members (37) and as a function of parameters

of the internal-combustion engine such as loading, rotational speed or the like.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, in which the valves are arranged at
an angle to the median longitudinal plane as viewed in the cross-section of the cylinder

head, 
characterized in that
 the second valve (16) and the third valve (17) are arranged
substantially at the same angle (
w
1
; w
2
) to the median longitudinal plane 
B-B
.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diameter
(
D 17
) of the opening (27) of the third valve (17) is smaller than the diameter (
D 15
 and

D 16
) of the other intake valves (15, 16).
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diameter
(
D 16
) of the opening (26) of the second intake valve (16) is larger than the diameter
(
D 17
) of the opening (27) of the third intake valve (17), but the said diameter (
D 16
) is
smaller than the diameter (
D 15
) of the opening (25) of the first intake valve (15).
An internal-combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

medium is supplied to the first intake valve (15) and the second intake valve (16) by way
of a first direct suction line (42) and to the third intake valve (17) by way of a second

suction line (43) crossing the cylinder head (11). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the second
suction line (43) is integrated in a cylinder-head hood (24).
An internal-combustion engine according to Claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that
 the
first suction line (42) and the second suction line (43) are each a constituent part of separate

suction units (44, 45).
An internal-combustion engine according to one or more of the preceding Claims, in
which the respective combustion chamber is bounded by a peripheral line - as viewed

from above - and has a centre which lies in a transverse plane of the cylinder head, and
the centres of the valve openings are situated on radial construction lines intersecting the

centre of the combustion chamber and arranged at an angle to the transverse plane,

characterized in that
the angle 
w
3
 for the centre (33) of the opening (25) of the first intake valve (15)
amounts to between 15° and 25°;
the angle 
w
4
 for the centre (34) of the opening (26) of the second intake valve (16)
amounts to between 50° and 60°;

w
5
 for the centre (35) of the opening (27) of the third intake valve (17)
amounts to between 50° and 60°;
the angle 
w
6
 for the centre (36) of the opening (28) of the exhaust valve (18) amounts
to between 40° and 50°.
An internal-combustion engine according to one or more of the preceding Claims with a
