<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for statistically analyzing QT interval as a function of
changes in the RR interval. The system and method utilize three statistical

comparisons to fully characterize the QT response: (1) the comparison of curves to
give an overall effect; (2) the incidence of points exceeding a baseline upper 95%

single-point prediction bound to reflect the degree of heterogeneity of ventricular
repolarization; and (3) the magnitude of these points to provide a quantitative

assessment of treatment-induced changes in the QT-RR relationship. The system
and method use the relationship between the QT interval and heart rate (RR

interval) to reference a control baseline response. Data from mammals such as
humans and dogs, and pharmacological maneuvers using both cardiac and non-cardiac

therapeutic agents, may be used with this multi-parameter statistical system
and method. Additionally, the system and method quantifies the incidence and

magnitude of points lying outside the upper 95% single-point prediction limit of the
regression analysis for vehicle versus treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to QT intervals, and, more 
particularly to a system and method of statistical analysis of QT interval as a 
function of changes in ventricular heart rate. The duration of cardiac ventricular depolarization and repolarization is 
represented as the QT interval, which extends from the beginning of the QRS 
complex to the end of the T wave on an electrocardiogram (ECG), see Fig. 1. QT 
interval prolongation has been associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias, 
including torsade de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to 
sudden death. Cardiovascular agents such as sotalol, as well as non-cardiovascular 
therapeutic agents terfenadine (Seldane®) and cisapride (Propulsid®) have caused 
QT prolongation and sudden death in humans. This has resulted in a more 
aggressive review by regulatory agencies of data supporting new drug applications. 
Therefore, a rigorous assessment of pre-clinical and clinical studies evaluating QT 
interval is advocated for both cardiac and non-cardiac therapeutic agents in 
development. Changes in heart rate play a major, though not exclusive, role in QT interval 
variation. Other sources of variation in QT interval include measurement technique, 
sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, electrolyte disorders (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), 
changes in cardiac afterload, diseases states, and drug modulators of channel 
activity within the myocardium. The QT interval, though, typically increases with 
decreasing heart rate ("HR"), reflected by an increase in the interval between 
heartbeats, or RR interval of the electrocardiogram, as shown in Fig. 1. Considerable debate has centered on how to compensate QT for changes in 
heart rate to provide a corrected QT interval (QTc). The most common approaches 
use Bazett or Fridericia's correction, which divide QT by the square root or cube root 
of the preceding RR interval, respectively. This calculation normalizes the QT interval 
to a heart rate of 60 beats/min (RR interval of 1 second) and provides the analyst with  
 
a single metric from which to assess changes in the QT trend. Both methods have 
their limitations when trying to compare subjects that have different heart rates. 
These one-parameter models under-correct QT at high heart rates and over-correct 
QT at heart rates below 60 beats/min. Undercorrection can lead to a false positive 
indication of problems while overcorrection may mask the potential hazards of high 
QT intervals. There is a growing consensus among
