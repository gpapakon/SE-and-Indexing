<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for cleaning a harmful 

gas which comprises bringing a gas containing a basic gas as 
a harmful component such as ammonia and amines into contact 

with a cleaning agent comprising a cupric salt supported on 
an inorganic carrier composed of an metallic oxide such as 

silica and alumina or a metallic oxide mixture of cupric 
oxide and manganese dioxide to remove the harmful component 

from the gas containing a basic gas. 
According to the above process, it is made possible 
to effectively remove a basic gas such as ammonia and 

trimethylamine contained in the exhaust gas from semiconductor 
production process; and a harmful basic gas contained in 

dilution gas such as air or nitrogen which dilutes the 
harmful gas suddenly leaked in emergency from a gas bomb 

filled inside with the harmful gas. Moreover, the process 
enables to prevent the occurrence of fire even in the 

coexistence of other gas such as silane, while maintaining 
excellent effect on the removal of the harmful gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
cleaning a harmful gas. More particularly, it pertains to a
process for cleaning a basic harmful gas such as
ammonia, amines or the like which is used in
semiconductor manufacturing industry.With the continuous development of semiconductor
industry, optoelectronics industry and precision machinery
and instrument industry, there has been a steady rise in
recent years in the amount of basic gases such as ammonia,
amines or the like which is used in such an industry.
The above-mentioned basic gases are each an indispensable
material in the production of a semiconductor, and
protective film, ultra-hard machinery and instrument,
ornamental or the like which production utilizes a chemical
vapor deposition, but is highly toxic and when discharged in
the atmosphere, it releases irritating odor, thus exerting
adverse influence on human bodies and environment.With regard to the maximum permissible concentration
of each of the gases to human bodies and in the atmosphere,
it is reported as being 25 ppm for ammonia and 10 ppm for
trimethylamine. Thus it is necessary to remove the
harmful component in the gas after being used in the 
aforesaid semiconductor production process prior to
discharge in the atmosphere.The aforementioned basic gases are usually
available on the market in the state that the gas is filled
in a 0.1 to 50 liters cylinder.In order to prevent the atmospheric air from being
widely polluted with a gas in case of its leakage from a
cylinder, the cylinder is used in the state that it is
connected to a gas supply piping to semiconductor process
while it is housed in a cylinder accommodation vessel so
called a cylinder box that is connected to a ventilation
duct. However, even if a cylinder is housed in a cylinder
box, there is no secured complete prevention of such
dangerous accident that the cylinder is emptied within only
about 5 to 10 minutes by a sudden leakage of the gas
therefrom. Under such circumstances, there is eagerly
desired a complete thorough countermeasure capable of well
coping with such accident to make the harmful gas completely
harmless.As a process for cleaning a basic gas that has
been discharged in the atmosphere, there are available
two kinds of processes, one being wet process in which the
basic components are absorbed in an absorbing solution
composed principally of aqueous solution of an acidic
component by the use of a scrubber; and the other being
dry process which make use of activated carbon, a porous
adsorbent of inorganic
