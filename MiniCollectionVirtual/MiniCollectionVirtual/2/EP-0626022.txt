<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for reducing the amount of interference substances in the water circulations of processes involving wood-based fibre suspensions by binding the disturbance substances to the fibres by means of cationic starch. The amount of the said starch added to the fibre suspension is approximately 0.04-0.5 % of the fibre dry weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
Several changes have taken place during the past few years in the water circulations of processes dealing with
wood-based fibre suspensions, especially in the case of water circulations connected to papermaking:Environmental and social pressures call for reductions in effluents to the water system. This leads to shortened
water circulations and their partial closing off.The need to save expensive fibre raw material calls for increasing use of recycled fibre. The use of recycled fibre
has increased significantly and there are countries where the legislation makes it compulsory to use such material.
For the same reason the use of groundwood and other mechanical pulps is on the rise.As a means of cutting costs, increasingly higher proportions of the more expensive filler and coater pigments in
the manufacturing of paper and board are being replaced by CaCO3. This requires a shift over from acidic processes
to neutral processes.Due to all the above reasons, increasing amounts of what may be called interference chemicals are becoming
concentrated in the process water circulations. The interference materials are chemically a highly heterogenous group
of compounds. Typical examples of these are wood extracts, neutral or anionically charged, substances in dissolved
or colloidal form arising during cellulose production or originating from the wood.In addition, coating binder residues, synthetic polymers, anionic emulgators, etc., end up in the water circulation
of the paper machine in the course of manufacturing of coated papers.De-inked recycled material can never equal virgin fibre raw material in terms of purity as it always contains deinking
chemical and ink residues.The aforementioned interference substances impair i.a. the runnability of the paper machine by increasing the
frequency of web breaks, by blocking up the wires, by contaminating the press rolls and by reducing paper quality in
terms of increasing number of holes. The interference substances reduce retention by reducing the efficiency of the
available retention system as impurities bind to the retention substance and thereby bind part of the functional groups
of the said retention substance.Broadly defined, all chemicals used in the above processes become interference substances once they become
concentrated in the water circulation. In its more emphasised form, this problem occurs expressly in paper machines.Traditionally, paper manufacturers have used alum to combat the effect of interference substances. Alum efficiently
binds interference

<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing the amount of interference substances, such as wood
extracts, coating binder residues, deinking chemicals, ink residues, etc, in the

water circulations of processes involving a web formation by dewatering of
wood-based fibre suspensions, 
characterized in that
 at a stage preceding the
web formation, cationised starch having a charge state of 1.5-3.5 meqv/g is

added to the fibre suspension in an amount of approximately 0.04 - 0.5 % of
the fibre dry matter in order to fix the interference substances from the water

circulation to the fibres to be subjected to the web formation, the cationised
starch being added before the stock starch and the retention agent.
A method of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a starch ether cationised with 2,3-epoxy-propyl-trimethylammoniumchloride
is used.
