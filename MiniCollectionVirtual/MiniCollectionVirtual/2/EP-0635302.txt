<ABSTRACT>
This invention is to a method of manufacturing 
fluid catalytic cracking catalyst. In particular, the 

invention is to a method of manufacturing a catalytic 
cracking catalyst which incorporates a step of matching the 

isoelectric point of each component of the catalyst framework 
structure to the pH of an inorganic oxide sol used to form 

the matrix component of the catalyst. The resulting catalyst 
product has a controlled pore size and is extremely durable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is to a method of manufacturing
fluid catalytic cracking catalyst. In particular, the
invention is to a method of manufacturing a catalytic
cracking catalyst which incorporates a step of matching the
isoelectric point of each component of the catalyst framework
structure to the pH of an inorganic oxide sol used to form
the matrix component of the catalyst.Fluid catalytic cracking catalysts generally
contain a framework structure comprising a crystalline
tetrahedral framework oxide component, an active porous
inorganic oxide catalyst framework component, and an inert
catalyst framework component. The framework structure is
typically held together by attachment with an inorganic oxide
matrix component.Each component of a fluid catalytic cracking
catalyst has its own particular function. The tetrahedral
framework oxide component catalyzes the breakdown of primary
products from the catalytic cracking reaction into clean
products such as naphtha for fuels and olefins for chemical
feedstocks. The active porous inorganic oxide catalyst
framework component catalyzes the formation of primary
products by cracking hydrocarbon molecules that are too large 
to fit inside the tetrahedral framework oxide component. Tne
inert catalyst framework component densifies, strengthens and
acts as a protective thermal sink. The inorganic oxide
matrix binds the catalyst framework structure components
together so that the catalyst product which is formed is hard
enough to survive interparticle and reactor wall collisions.In addition to acting as a binder material, the
matrix component also serves as a reactive medium for the
diffusion of feedstock and cracked products. In general, the
matrix will have a pore structure that allows the diffusion
of hydrocarbon molecules in and out of the catalyst
particles. This pore structure is desirably one that will
not deteriorate during severe hydrothermal treatment of the
catalyst. By favoring or inhibiting the diffusion of certain
hydrocarbon molecules, the pore structure will affect the
activity and selectivity of the catalyst.The matrix also serves as a diluting medium for
the crystalline tetrahedral framework oxide component. This
moderates catalyst activity and avoids overcracking of the
products to coke and gas.The matrix can also act as a sink for sodium
ions. Through solid-solid ion exchange, the sodium ions
migrate from the crystalline tetrahedral framework oxides
into the matrix, which increases the thermal and hydrothermal
stability of the catalyst.The matrix
