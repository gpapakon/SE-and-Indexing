Circuit arrangement for operating one or more
low-pressure discharge lamps, comprising


a push-pull frequency generator having a drive device
(A, A') and a DC power supply (G),
at least one series resonance circuit, to which a
radio frequency signal is applied by the push-pull

frequency generator, and which includes at least one
resonance inductor (LD, LD1, LD2) and at least one

resonance capacitor (C1, C91, C92),
terminals for at least one low-pressure discharge lamp
(LP, LP1, LP2) having electrode filaments (E1, E2,

E10, E20, E11, E21), each electrode filament (E1, E2,
E10, E20, E11, E21) having two terminals,
at least one heating circuit for preheating the
electrode filaments (E1, E2, E10, E20, E11, E21) of

the low-pressure discharge lamp (LP) or of the low-pressure
discharge lamps (LP1, LP2), having switching

means (K, K1, K2) for closing and opening the heating
circuit or the heating circuits, it being the case

that these switching means (K, K1, K2) switch the
heating circuit or the heating circuits between a low-resistance

state and a high-resistance state, and that
the quality of the series resonance circuit or of the

series resonance circuits is increased with respect to
the preheating phase, with the result that at the end

of this electrode preheating phase the starting
voltage for the low-pressure discharge lamp (LP) or

the low-pressure discharge lamps (LP1, LP2) can be
provided at the resonance capacitor or at the 

resonance capacitors (C1, C91, C92),
a rectifier (GL, GL', GL1),
a controllable electronic switch (S, S') which is
constructed as a threshold-value or time switch, is connected

to the DC output of the rectifier (GL, GL', GL1) and
which actuates the switching means (K, K1, K2) as a

function of the ohmic resistance of the electrode
filaments (E1, E2, E10, E20, E11, E21) which increases

with the heating up,

characterized in that the electronic switch (S, S') is
fed a heating voltage which is rectified by the rectifier

(GL, GL', GL1) and drops during the preheating phase
between the two terminals of at least one electrode

filament (E1, E2, E10, E20, E11, E21).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the circuit arrangement includes at least

two low-pressure discharge lamps (LP1, LP2) which are
connected in parallel with one another and each have a

heating circuit for preheating their electrodes (E10,
E20, E11, E21), and the switching means are constructed

as a relay whose relay contacts (K1, K2) are each
integrated into a heating circuit.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the circuit arrangement includes at least

two series-connected low-pressure discharge lamps, the
electrode filaments of these lamps being integrated in a

common heating circuit for preheating the electrode
filaments.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the switching means are constructed as a

relay and the controllable electronic switch (S) has a
thyristor (Th, Th') as well as a zener diode (DZ, DZ'),

the zener diode (DZ, DZ') being connected to the gate of
the thyristor (Th, Th') and the thyristor (Th, Th') being

connected in series with the relay coil (RL, RL') of the
relay.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the switching means are constructed as a 

relay, and the controllable electronic switch (S) has a
thyristor (Th1) and an RC element (R20, C20), the RC

element (R20, C20) being connected to the gate of the
thyristor (Th1), and the thyristor (Th1) being connected

in series with the relay coil (RL1) of the relay.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the circuit arrangement has at least one

current-limiting capacitor (C5, C17, C18) which is
connected to the AC input of the rectifier (GL, GL',

GL1).
