<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation curable and cured 
compositions having improved adhesion to substrates. Radiation cured acrylate monomers and oligomers generally 
adhere poorly to plastic, glass, paper, wood, metal, painted surfaces, 
leather, ceramic and textile substrates following cure. The poor 
adhesiveness of these monomers and oligomers to the substrates may 
be the result of shrinkage due to volume changes that occur during 
curing. The shrinkage may produce internal stresses that cause the 
monomers and oligomers to separate from the substrate. As a result, adhesion of radiation cured acrylate monomers and 
oligomers to the aforementioned substrates is generally not achieved 
immediately after curing. Rather, a post-cure thermal bake cycle is 
conventionally used to overcome the internal stresses and promote 
adhesion. Use of higher molecular weight acrylates also has been used 
to improved adhesion, however it can result in diminished cure rates 
and soft films with less abrasion and chemical resistance due to 
decreased crosslink densities. Thus, a need exists for radiation cured acrylate monomer and 
oligomer compositions with improved adhesion to substrates. 
Specifically, a need exists for radiation cured acrylate monomer and 
oligomer compositions in which improved adhesion to substrates is 
achieved without the need for a post-cure thermal bake cycle. It has been discovered that improved adhesion to substrates 
may be achieved by incorporating a metal salt of an α,β-ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid into radiation curable compounds. 
Accordingly, the present invention pertains, among other things, to 
radiation curable, and cured, compositions comprising at least : 
(a) a radiation curable compound ; and (b) a metal salt of an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. In another aspect, the invention pertains to a method for 
adhering a radiation cured composition to a substrate comprising the 
steps of: 
(a) coating a substrate with a radiation curable composition 
comprising at least a radiation curable compound and a metal salt 
of an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid ; and  (b) exposing the coated substrate to radiation to effect curing of the 
composition. Yet in another aspect, the invention pertains to a substrate 
having, on at least one portion of its surface, a coating or film formed 
from the radiation cured formulation comprising at least : 
(a) a radiation curable compound ; (b) a metal salt of α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. The
