<ABSTRACT>
The steam generator with a plate comprises a fixed plate (3) equipped with an electric resistance heater (4), a movable plate (5) held applied against a first main face (3A) of the fixed plate (3) by elastic restoring means (8), means (6) of introducing water under pressure into the interface between the fixed heating plate (3) and the movable plate (5) and means (7) of removing the steam formed in an instantaneous manner at the interface between the fixed and movable plates (3, 5) and introduced into the steam recovery cavity (91) from the peripheral part of the plates (3, 5). A steam recovery cavity (91) is situated between a second main face (3B) of the first heating plate (3) and a first profiled part (1) of a casing (1, 2) so as to create a secondary system of complementary evaporation by projection of the flow of steam issuing from the interface between the two plates (3, 5) towards the second main face (3B) of the heating plate (3) so that the general efficiency of the steam generator is improved.
