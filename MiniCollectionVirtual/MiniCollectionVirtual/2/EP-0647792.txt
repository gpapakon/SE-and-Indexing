<CLAIMS>
Clutch plate for a friction clutch comprising a hub for mounting on 
a gearbox shaft to rotate with it, a hub disc with or without 

torsional vibration damper, a carrier for two axially spaced friction 
rings which are arranged concentric with the axis of rotation and 

are secured to the carrier and have an inside diameter and an 
outside diameter,
 
characterised in that,
 
the ratio of outside diameter (Da) to inside diameter (D
i
) lies in the 
range from 1.25 to 1.38. 
Clutch plate according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the ratio of outside diameter (D
a
) to inside diameter (D
i
) lies 
approximately in the region of 1.3. 
Clutch plate according to claim 1, the two friction rings being 
secured to the carrier with the interposition of a substantially 

axially acting spring device,
 
characterised in that,
 
a residual spring travel (X) is provided with the clutch in its 

engaged state. 
Clutch plate according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that,
 
the residual spring travel (X) amounts to 0.10 to 0.30.
