<ABSTRACT>
A roller (11; Figs 1,2) for controlling the application of carrier liquid to an image 
bearing member (2; Figs 1,2) in an electrostatographic reproduction apparatus having a rigid 

porous electroconductive supportive core (46), a conformable microporous covering (47) 
provided around the core, and a pressure controller (48). The pressure controller (48) is located 

to provide a positive or negative pressure within the porous core (46) and across a cross section 
of the core (46) and covering (47).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatographic printing machine, and more 
particularly to an apparatus for developing a latent image recorded on an imaging surface with 
a liquid developer. A typical electrostatographic printing machine employs a photoconductive member 
that is sensitized by charging to a substantially uniform potential. The charged portion of the 
photoconductive member is exposed to the light image of a document. Exposure of the 
charged pnotoconductive member selectively dissipates the charge to record an electrostatic 
latent image. The electrostatic latent image corresponds to the informational areas of the 
document. The electrostatic latent image recorded on the photoconductive member is 
developed by contact with a developer material. The developer material can be a dry material 
comprising carrier granules having adhering toner particles. The latent image attracts the 
toner particles from the carrier granules to form a toner powder image on the 
photoconductive surface. The toner powder image is then transferred and permanently fused 
to a copy sheet. An electrostatic latent image also may be developed with a liquid developer 
material. In a liquid development system, the photoconductive surface is contacted with an 
insulating liquid carrier having dispersed finely divided marking particles. The electrical field 
associated with the electrostatic latent image attracts the marking particles to the 
photoconductive surface to form a visible image. Liquid developing imaging processes utilize a liquid developer typically having about 
2 percent by weight of fine solid particulate toner material dispersed in a liquid carrier. The 
liquid carrier is typically a hydrocarbon. In the developing process, the image is transferred to a 
receiver which may be an intermediate belt. The image on the photoreceptor contains about 
12 weight percent of particulate toner in liquid hydrocarbon carrier. To improve the quality of 
transfer of developed image to receiver, percent solids in liquid should be increased to about 
25 percent by weight increase in percent solids may be achieved by removing excess hydrocarbon 
liquid. However excess hydrocarbon liquid must be removed in a manner that results in 
minimum degradation of the toner image. US-A-3,866,572, to Gundlach, relates to an electrostatographic apparatus wherein a 
transfer bias voltage is applied between a roller electrode and a first support surface to provide 
an electrical field for transfer between roller and surface. The roller
