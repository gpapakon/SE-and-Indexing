<ABSTRACT>
In a method of recovering catalytically active precious metals from used exhaust gas catalysts, the used exhaust gas catalysts are, after addition of an alkyl metal chloride, introduced into a chlorine gas atmosphere for a particular residence time at elevated temperature in a single process step in a reactor and hexachloro complexes are thereby formed from the platinum group metals contained in the exhaust gas catalysts. After cooling the reaction product, the hexachloro complexes of the metals are extracted with greatly diluted hydrochloric acid.

A process for the recovery of the precious metals of the platinum group
comprising catalytically active platinum and rhodium from used exhaust

catalysers, in which the used exhaust catalysers, following the addition of
an alkali chloride, are put into a reactor at increased temperature in a

chlorine gas atmosphere and the chlorides hereby obtained are recovered by
washing out, 
characterised in that
 the alkali chloride is added by an amount
of up to 10 times the precious metal content, consisting of platinum and

rhodium, in gram-atoms, of the exhaust catalysers, that the exhaust
catalysers are brought into the reactor in a single stage process at a

temperature between 350°C and 650°C for a dwell time of between 0.2 and
3 hours in the chlorine gas atmosphere and hexachloride complexes are

thereby formed from the precious metals contained in them and that after
cooling of the reaction products the hexachloride complexes of the metals

are extracted using dilute hydrochloric acid at a pH value setting of 1.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the applied
temperatures lie between 550°C and 650°C.
A process according to one of the Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that
the dwell time lies between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.
A process according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that
the reaction is performed in a rotating reactor, preferably in a rotating tube

reactor.
A process according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that
alkali chloride is added to the reaction mass arising from the used exhaust

catalysers in the aforementioned rotating tube reactor before the reaction. 
A process according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that
the added quantity of alkali chloride amounts to 3 to 5 times the metal

content of the exhaust catalysers in gram-atoms.
A process according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that
the addition of alkali chloride is effected in solid or dissolved form.
A process according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that
the extraction is effected at a raised temperature of 90°C.
