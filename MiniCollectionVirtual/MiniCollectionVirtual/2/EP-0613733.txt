<ABSTRACT>
Processing tank (32) for an industrial cleaning installation for cleaning objects, in particular processed workpieces (70), by means of a cleaning fluid, the tank (32) having at least one movable tank wall segment (16,18) to enable simple transportation of the workpieces (70) into the processing tank (32) and out of the latter, which tank wall segment is movable between a working position in which it forms the tank with at least one second tank wall segment (10,12 and 16,18, respectively), and a loading and unloading position in which a workpiece (70) can be brought into the tank (32) and removed therefrom, respectively, at least approximately in the horizontal direction.

<CLAIMS>
Treatment tank (32) for an industrial cleaning 
installation for cleaning articles, in particular, 

machined workpieces, by means of a cleaning liquid, 
the said treatment tank (32) comprising two end walls 

(10, 12), two side walls (16, 18) located opposite each 
other, and a bottom (16, 18), and the said treatment tank 

(32) having at least two movable tank wall segments (16, 
18) which are movable between a working position in which 

they form with at least one further tank wall segment 
(14) the tank (32), and a loading and unloading position 

in which a workpiece (70) is introducible into the tank 
(32) and removable therefrom, respectively, 
characterized 
in that
 in their working position, the movable tank wall 
segments (16, 18) form two side walls located opposite 

each other and at least part of the bottom of the tank 
(32) and are designed and movable such that the tank (32) 

has an opening on its underside when the movable wall 
segments (16, 18) are located in their loading and 

unloading position. 
Treatment tank as defined in claim 1, characterized in 
that the movable tank wall segments (16, 18) are movable 

in at least essentially the vertical direction.  
 
Treatment tank as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by at least one guide (20, 22, 24, 26) for each of the 

moveable tank wall segments (16, 18). 
Treatment tank as defined in one or several of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the two end walls (10, 12) 

are stationary, and the moveable tank wall segments (16, 
18) extend between the two end walls. 
Treatment tank as defined in claim 4, characterized in 
that the tank (32) comprises between its end walls (10, 

12) a stationary hood (14), which closes the tank at the 
top, and below this hood the moveable wall segments (16, 

18). 
Treatment tank as defined in claims 3 and 4, 
characterized in that a coulisse guide (20, 22 

and 24, 26, respectively) is provided for each of the 
two ends of each of the movable wall segments (16, 18), 

the said ends being adjacent to the end walls, for 
engagement of guide elements (28) of the respective wall 

segment (16, 18) in the coulisse guide. 
Treatment tank as defined in one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a collecting 

container (80) for cleaning liquid which is open at the 
top is arranged at least under those joint lines along 

which the movable wall segments (16, 18) adjoin adjacent 
wall segments (18 and 16, respectively, 14, 10, 12).  

 
Treatment tank as defined in one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a storage 

container (34) for cleaning liquid provided at the bottom 
thereof with a controllable closure (38) for emptying it 

into the treatment tank (32) is associated with and 
arranged above the tank (32). 
Treatment tank as defined in claim 8, characterized in 
that the storage container (34) extends at least almost 

over the entire length of the treatment tank (32), and 
the closure (38) extends at least almost over the entire 

length of the storage container (34). 
Treatment tank as defined in claims 7 and 8, 
characterized by a return pipeline for the cleaning 

liquid which connects the collecting container (80) with 
the storage container (34). 
Treatment tank as defined in one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that spray nozzles 

(90) for spraying a workpiece located in the treatment 
tank are provided in the treatment tank (32) outside 

of the path of the workpieces (70), and in that the 
treatment tank is provided with an overflow (100) which 

is arranged in the upper region thereof. 
Treatment tank as defined in claims 8 and 11, 
characterized by a return pipeline for the cleaning 

liquid which connects the overflow (100) with the storage 
container (34).  

 
Treatment tank as defined in one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the cross section 

of each of the movable wall segments (16, 18) corresponds 
approximately to a quadrant.
