<ABSTRACT>
The socket (2) is inserted in a bore in the end face of a central buffer coupling. It has protrusions working in grooves in a flange and is turned in the bore behind the flange to lock it. It slides into the bore in opposition to a coil spring (9) inside the latter and forms a permanent seal against a pipe (10) enclosed by the spring. An S-shaped spring (1) comprises a longer arm (1) and a shorter locking stirrup (1b). It is passed via one of the grooves into the annular gap (15) between the spring and bore (3), its arm being clamped in the spring guide (11). The stirrup is gripped in the groove through which it is inserted so that it cannot slide.

Retainer for an air line coupling sleeve, in particular an air line 
coupling sleeve on a main or brake air line of a coupling head housing of 

a central buffer coupling in which the coupling sleeve can be inserted in 
a bore from the front face of the coupling head housing and on its 

external surface exhibits projections for the purpose of guidance in 
grooves which are located in a flange of the bore located on the front 

face side, and locking is effected by rotation behind the flange in a 
widened part of the bore in which an annular gap exists between the 

coupling head housing and a coil spring located in the bore, the coupling 
sleeve being capable of being pushed into the interior of the bore hole 

against the force of the coil spring and continuously bearing sealingly on 
a sealing pipe surrounded by the coil spring, characterised in that a 

spring element (1) which exhibits an S-shape and consists of a longer 
spring leg (1a) and a shorter curved locking part (1b), can be inserted 

into the annular gap (15) through one of the grooves (14), is clamped with 
its spring leg (1a) partly in the locating portion (11) of the coil spring 

(9) and is braced so that it cannot move with its curved locking part (1b) 
in the groove (14) through which it can be inserted.
