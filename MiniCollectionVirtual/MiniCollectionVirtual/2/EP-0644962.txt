<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to nonwoven fabrics and 
to a process for producing nonwoven fabrics. More 
specifically, the invention relates to composite 
nonwoven barrier fabrics particularly suited for 
medical applications. Nonwoven barrier fabrics have been developed 
which impede the passage of bacteria and other 
contaminants and which are used for disposable medical 
fabrics, such as surgical drapes, disposable gowns and 
the like. For example, such barrier fabrics can be 
formed by sandwiching an inner fibrous web of 
thermoplastic meltblown microfibers between two outer 
nonwoven webs of substantially continuous thermoplastic 
spunbonded filaments. The fibrous meltblown web 
provides a barrier impervious to bacteria or other 
contaminants in the composite nonwoven fabric. Such 
composite fabric structures are known generally in the 
art as spunbond-meltblown-spunbond, or "SMS," fabrics. 
Examples of such fabrics are described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,041,203 and U.S. Patent No. 4,863,785. In the manufacture of this type of fabric, 
the respective nonwoven layers are thermally bonded 
together to form a unitary composite fabric. 
Typically, the thermal bonding involves passing the 
nonwoven layers through a heated patterned calender and  
 
partially melting the inner meltblown layer in discrete 
areas to form fusion bonds which hold the nonwoven 
layers of the composite together. Without sufficient 
melting and fusion of the meltblown layer, the 
composite fabric will have poor inter-ply adhesion. 
However, unless the thermal bonding conditions are 
accurately controlled, the possibility exists that the 
thermal bond areas may be heating excessively, causing 
"pinholes" which can compromise or destroy the barrier 
properties of the inner meltblown layer. Thus in 
practice, the thermal bonding conditions which are used 
represent a compromise between the required inter-ply 
adhesion strength on the one hand, and the required 
barrier properties which must be provided by the 
meltblown layer on the other. The conventional SMS type barrier fabrics 
also have limitations in the types of sterilization 
procedures which can be used. For some applications, 
it is desired that the fabric or garment be sterilized 
in the final stages of manufacture by exposure to gamma 
radiation. For example, the fabric or garment may 
first be sealed in a protective package, and then 
exposed to gamma radiation to sterilize the package and 
its contents. However, sterilization by gamma 
irradiation has been found to be
