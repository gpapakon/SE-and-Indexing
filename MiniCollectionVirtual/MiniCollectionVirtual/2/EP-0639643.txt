<ABSTRACT>
A mutant AOX2 promoter wherein 1 to 3 oligonucleotide(s) 
GATAGGCTATTTTTGTCGCATAAAT is(are) added in the normal direction, 

the reverse direction or in both the normal and reverse 

directions at the 5' end of a partial DNA fragment of a 
wild-type AOX2 promoter, a vector carrying said promoter, a 

transformant into which said vector has been introduced and a 
method for producing a heterologous protein, comprising culture 

of said transformant. The mutant AOX2 promoter of the present 
invention has a markedly enforced promoter activity as compared 

with wild-type AOX2 promoters. Accordingly, the promoter of 
the present invention is highly utilizable as a promoter to be 

carried by a vector capable of expressing a heterologous 
protein. The vector of the present invention can efficiently 

express and produce various useful heterologous proteins in 
hosts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mutant alcohol oxydase 2 (AOX2) promoter
suitably used for expressing a heterologous gene, a vector
carrying said promoter, a transformant into which said vector
has been introduced and a method for producing a heterologous
protein, comprising culturing said transformant.In the fields of genetic engineering, improvements and
development of gene expression systems have been conventionally
done in an attempt to increase the expression of gene and the
yield of objective proteins. The expression system using, as a
host, a methylotrophic yeast is drawing attention as a system
for expressing heterologous protein genes.The methylotrophic yeast is capable of proliferation using
methanol as a carbon and energy source. This is attributable to
the fact that it has a gene encoding alcohol oxydase
(EC1.1.3.B, hereinafter also referred to as AOX) which is an
enzyme catalyzing a first reaction in the metabolism of
methanol, namely, oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde.Pichia pastoris is one of the methylotrophic yeasts and has
two kinds of AOX genes, AOX1 gene and AOX2 gene, each known as
having a peculiar promoter at the 5' end side nontranslated region
(AOX1 promoter, AOX2 promoter). An AOX2 promoter has an 
extremely weak transcription activity, being in sharp contrast to
an AOX1 promoter having a strong transcription activity, and
the AOX actually expressed and produced is mostly derived from
the AOX1 gene [Molecular and Cellular Biology, Vol. 9, 1316
(1989)].For the production of a heterologous protein by the use of
a Pichia yeast, conventionally, an AOX1 promoter having a strong
transcription activity is used. In recent years, moreover,
methods for producing heterologous proteins by using the
regulatory region of said AOX genes have been studied [Yeast,
5, 167-177 (1989), EP-A-344459, EP-A-347928]. There is a
strong demand for a promoter having a strong transcription
activity to increase the expression of the heterologous protein.An object of the present invention is to provide a promoter
useful for a large-scale production of a heterologous protein,
a vector carrying said promoter, and a transformant into which
said vector has been introduced. Also, the present invention
aims at establishing a method for producing a heterologous
protein, comprising culturing said transformant.It has been found that the use, as a promoter, of a
DNA fragment obtained by inserting (a) nucleotide sequence(s)
comprising a specific nucleotide sequence upstream from a
partial DNA fragment of a
