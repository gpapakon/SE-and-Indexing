<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antineoplastic
pharmaceutical composition for plural administrations.
Specifically, it relates to an antineoplastic pharmaceutical
composition for plural administrations which comprises a
fumagillol derivative having angiogenesis inhibitory activity
or a salt thereof (hereinafter sometimes referred to as TNP)
in combination with a platinum complex having cytocidal
activity.Recent pharmacotherapies for cancer have mainly
employed chemotherapeutic agents in order to kill tumor cells
by their cytocidal activity. However, although presently
available chemotherapeutic agents have useful pharmacological
activities, they are also highly toxic to normal cells. Their
anti-tumor activity is low at such a low dose that side
effects are inhibited. Thus, the pharmacotherapies are
unsatisfactory.Recently, angiogenesis inhibitors have intensively
been studied for novel pharmacotherapies of cancer, and many
preclinical test results have been reported [e.g., Advances
in Cancer Research, 43, 175 (1985)]. Angiogenesis is 
essential for the growth of solid tumor, and the growth of
vascular endothelial cells is extremely vigorous in tumor
tissues. On the other hand, in normal adults, angiogenesis
is not observed except in tissues related to reproduction, and
the turnover of vascular endothelial cells is very slow, i.e.
on the order of months. Therefore, it is suggested that
angiogenesis inhibitors which selectively inhibit the growth
of vascular endothelial cells can be antineoplastic agents
having new mechanisms of action and remarkably reduced side
effects in comparison with conventional chemotherapeutic
agents against cancer.A fumagillin derivative, 6-O-(N-chloroacetylcarbamoyl)fumagillol,
is an angiogenesis-specific
inhibitor which has been found to exhibit cytostatic
inhibitory effects on the growth of vascular endothelial cells
in a wide range of low concentration (for example, 30pg/ml-3µg/ml)
and selectively inhibit tube formation [Biochemical
and Biophysical Research Communications, 174, 1070 (1991)].
Further, it has been reported that this compound exhibits
tumor growth inhibitory activity and prolongs survival time
based on the angiogenesis inhibitory activity when the
compound is systemically administered to tumor-bearing animals
having transplanted tumor cells against which the compound has
low activity of direct tumor growth inhibition [Nature, 348,
555 (1990)]. Further, with regard to a combination of 6-O-(N-chloroacetylcarbamoyl)fumagillol
and other drugs, therapeutic
effect
