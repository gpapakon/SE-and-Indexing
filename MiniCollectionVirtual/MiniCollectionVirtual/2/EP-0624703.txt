<ABSTRACT>
An operator for a window has a chain (2) as an operating 
member, a sprocket wheel (4) for advancing and retracting 

the chain (2), and a counterbalancing spring (5) operatively 
connected to a shaft (9) of the sprocket wheel (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operator for
opening and closing a window having a main frame and a
sash mounted for pivotal movement relative to the main
frame between a closed position and any position within
a range of ventilating positions, the sash being mounted
in such a way that a substantial component of its weight
will force the window towards said closed position, said
operator comprising:
a housing designed for mounting on a frame member
of the main frame; a flexible operating member positioned in said housing
and having an end adapted to be connected to the
sash; anddrive means including a movable part engaging said
flexible operating member for moving it between a
retracted position in which said flexible operating
member is entirely accommodated in the housing and any
of a number of projecting positions in which the
flexible operating member projects from the housing,
said retracted position corresponding to the closed
position and said projecting positions corresponding to
the ventilating positions of the window.Manually-operated and power-driven operators are
known for moving a window between closed and open
positions, for example, a window having a stationary
main frame mounted in a roof of a house or other
building, especially a sloped roof, and a sash hinged
to the main frame at the top of the sash for pivoting
toward and away from the main frame. Such operators are
typically mounted on a bottom member of the main frame
and connected to a bottom member of the sash for pushing
the sash away from the main frame and drawing the sash
into engagement with the main frame. When the window 
operator is actuated to move the window in an opening
direction, it must overcome a component of the weight
of the window, especially when the window is mounted in
a roof. A chain operator for such a window, and disclosing the features of the preamble of claim 1, is disclosed in
US-A-4. 521,993 issued to Tacheny et al.Another window operator is known from US-A-4,481,735
which is considered the most relevant state
of the art to the present invention.For chain-operated automobile windows, which are
vertically slidable from an open position in which the
pane is retracted in a door or carbody part subjacent
to the window opening it is known e.g. from US-A-1,563,115
to assist the lifting movement of the pane
towards the closed position by a counterbalancing spiral
spring arranged in connection with the chain drive
mechanism.Moreover, US-A-2,698,173, US-A-5,097,629 and US-A-5,179,803

<CLAIMS>
An operator for opening and closing a window
having a main frame and a sash mounted for pivotal

movement relative to the main frame between a closed
position and any position within a range of ventilating

positions, the sash being mounted in such a way that a
substantial component of its weight will force the

window towards said closed position, said operator
comprising:


a housing (1) designed for mounting on a frame
member of the main frame;
a flexible operating member (2) positioned in said
housing (1) and having an end adapted to be connected

to the sash; and
drive means (4) including a movable part engaging
said flexible operating member for moving it between a

retracted position in which said flexible operating
member (2) is entirely accommodated in the housing (1)

and any of a number of projecting positions in which the
flexible operating member (2) projects from the housing

(1), said retracted position corresponding to the closed
position and said projecting positions corresponding to

the ventilating positions of the window;

   
characterized
 in that counterbalancing means (5) positioned entirely within the housing (1)
is provided for counterbalancing said

weight component, said counterbalancing means comprising
a tension spring (5) one end (5a) of which is connected

with a stationary wall of the housing (1), whereas the
other end (5b) is operatively connected with the movable

part of said drive means via a flexible member (7) guided
in the housing (1) by a guide member (8) to a connection on a

shaft (9) of the drive means (4) to provide a counterbalancing
force in the direction of movement of said flexible operating

member (2) from the retracted position towards said projecting
positions so as to transmit to said flexible operating 

member (2) a force acting to facilitate movement of the
window against its weight from said closed position to

said ventilating position.
An operator as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that said flexible operating member is a chain (2)
and the movable part of said drive means for moving said

flexible operating member comprises a rotatable sprocket
wheel (4) mounted in said housing (1), said rotatable

sprocket wheel (4) engaging said chain (2).
An operator as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized

in that said rotatable sprocket wheel (4) has a shaft
(9), said shaft having means for coupling said shaft to

a drive unit (11,13).
An operator as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized

in that said drive unit is a manual drive unit (11).
An operator as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that said one end (5a) of the
spring (5) is connected with said stationary wall of the

housing (1) via adjusting means for adjusting the spring
tension.
An operator as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that said counterbalancing
spring means comprises two separate series connected

spring sections (25,26) extending in overlying parallel
relationship.
An operator as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5,


characterized
 in that said counterbalancing spring means
comprises two separate spring sections (29,30) connected

in parallel.
An operator as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized

in that said drive unit is an electric drive unit (13).
An operator as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized

in that said chain comprises alternating chain members
(14) and links (16), and rivets (17) interconnecting

said chain member (14) and said links (16), said rivets 
(17) having projecting ends, said rotatable sprocket

wheel (4) engaging said projecting ends.
An operator as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that said counterbalancing
spring means axis has a stationary axis.
