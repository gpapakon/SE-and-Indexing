<CLAIMS>
Phase regulating arrangement having a phase
detector (PD), to which a reference signal (rs) and an

input signal (is) are applied, the said input signal
being passed via a controllable delay device (DL), having

a regulator (R), which is connected downstream of the
phase detector (PD) and controls the load path, shunt-connected

between the signal path and a respective
capacitor (C, C'), of at least one field-effect transistor

(T1, T1') in the delay device (DL) for the purpose of
regulation in a small detection range, and having at

least one inverter (T2, T3, T2', T3') in the signal path
of the delay device (DL),

characterized in that the respective load paths of two
further field-effect transistors (T4, T5, T4', T5') are

connected into the supply lines of the at least one
inverter (T2, T3, T2', T3'), and in that the load pat-hs

of the further field-effect transistors (T4, T5, T4',
T5') are controlled by a further regulator (DA, Z) for

the purpose of regulation in a wide detection range, the
said further regulator being connected downstream of the

phase detector (PD).
Phase regulating arrangement according to Claim
1,

characterized in that the further regulator has a digital-to-analog
converter (DA) for controlling the further

field-effect transistors (T4, T5, T4', T5'), a counter
(Z) clocked by a clock signal (cs) being connected

upstream of the said converter, and in that the counting
direction of the counter (Z) is controlled by the phase 

detector (PD).
Phase regulating arrangement according to Claim
1 or 2,

characterized in that until a quasi-steady regulating
state of the further regulator (DA, Z) is reached, the

first regulator (R) is deactivated, and in that after the
quasi-steady regulating state is reached, the said

further regulator is stopped and the first regulator (R)
is activated.
Phase regulating arrangement according to one of
Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the time constant of the first
regulator (R) is lower than the time constant of the

further regulator (DA, Z).
Phase regulating arrangement according to one of
Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the phase detector (PD) comprises
two mutually independent detector elements (PD1, PD2),

which are each driven by the reference signal (rs) and
the input signal (es) and each drive one of the two

regulators (R, DA, Z).
