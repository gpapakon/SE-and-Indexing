<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for removing one or more 
contaminations from dry solid bulk material, in which 
method the dry solid bulk material is fed into a treating 
chamber, said treating chamber being formed by a drum 
rotatable around a rotation axis, which drum comprises a 
casing containing an electrically conductive material, 
said dry solid bulk material is subjected to a temperature 
treatment under subatmospheric pressure during rotation of 
the drum by heating the container by means of electrical 
induction heating and said treated dry solid bulk material 
is discharged from said treating chamber. The invention relates furthermore to an apparatus for 
carrying out the method according to the invention, said 
apparatus comprising a treating chamber for the treatment 
therein of contaminated dry solid bulk material, the 
treating chamber being a drum of which the casing contains 
an electrically conductive material, the apparatus comprising 
rotating means for rotating the drum around a rotational 
axis, feeding means for feeding the dry solid bulk 
material in the treating chamber, discharging means for 
discharging the treated dry solid bulk material from the 
treating chamber, heating means comprising an electrical 
induction means arranged around the drum for heating the 
dry solid bulk material in the treating chamber, and 
vacuum means for forming a subatmospheric pressure in the 
treating chamber.  
 A method as described in the opening paragraph is known 
from EP 0 423 039 A1. In this method the dry solid bulk 
material is fed in the drum through an opening after which 
the drum is activated to rotate. During rotation the dry 
solid bulk material is subjected to a temperature which is 
strictly lower than 500Â°C at a pressure which is in the 
order of 0.01 bar or more, for a period of three hours or 
more in order to remove contaminations. After this treatment 
the dry solid bulk material is discharged through the 
same opening. It is one of the objects of the invention to provide a 
method for removing one or more contaminations from a dry 
solid bulk material with which a high removal yield can be 
achieved in an efficient way with no or at least a low 
risk to the environment. It is another object of the invention to provide an apparatus 
for carrying out the inventive method. For this purpose a method as described in the opening 
paragraph is, in accordance with the invention, characterized 
in that said drum is provided with at least one 
entrance and at least one separate
