<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL ANTIBODIES FOR CONFERRING PASSIVE IMMUNITY AGAINST INFECTION BY A PATHOGEN IN HUMANSField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to the field of monoclonal and reco binant antibodies directed to epitopes on selected pathogens, e.g., a malaria parasite, methods for preparing and using, and compositions employing, these antibodies.Background of the Invention Malaria is a severe and widespread disease, caused by various species of the protozoan parasite genus Plasmodium, including four species that infect man, e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae [See, e.g., V. Enea et aJL. , Science, 225:628-630 (1984)]. Malaria remains one of the most widespread and fatal diseases in the world today because of the lack of an effective vaccine and programs to control vector populations, as well as new drug-resistant strains. Generally, treatment of malaria relies heavily on prophylactic drugs, such as the 4-aminoguinolines.However, for most cases, drug resistance by P. falciparum and the production of some undesirable side effects, have undermined the efficacy of these drug therapies.The focus of much research effort in the field of malaria prophylaxis is the sporozoite form of thePlasmodium parasite, particularly the circumsporozoite (CS) protein [Clyde et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.. 4:397 (1975); Rieckman et al. , Bull. WHO. 57(1) :261 (1979); and U. S. Patent 4,957,869]. The cloning and characterization of the CS protein genes or fragments thereof of a number of Plasmodium species and recombinant expression thereof in E. coli or yeast host cells have been reported. The central repeat domain of the CS proteins is immunodominant, i.e., if one injects 

sporozoites into an animal, the animal produces anti- repeat antibodies. The first anti-sporozoite candidate vaccine tested in man was based upon the repetitive epitopes found on the CS protein of P. falciparum consisting of (AsnAlaAsnPro)37(AsnValAspPro)4 [SEQ ID NO: 1] , which is invariant in a number of strains examined to date. Clinical trials utilizing a vaccine candidate, called R32tet32, consisting of NH2-Met-Asp-Pro-[(Asn-Ala- Asn-Pro)15(Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)^-Leu-Arg-Arg-Thr-His-Arg- Gly-Arg-His-His-Arg-Arg-His-Arg-Cys-Gly-Cys-Trp-Arg-Leu- Tyr-Arg-Arg-His-His-Arg-Trp-Gly-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser-COOH [SEQ ID NO: 2], produced a protective response in a human volunteer against the sporozoite challenge [see, Ballou et al.. The Lancet, June 6, 1987, pp. 1277-1281; and European Patent Publication No. 0192626, published August 27, 1986,
