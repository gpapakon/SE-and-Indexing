<ABSTRACT>
A code data read apparatus for photographic film comprises a 
light emitter 23, lenses 22a and 22b, and a sensor 21, wherein a bar 

code 24 recorded on a film F is exposed to light from the light 
emitter 23 and the enlarged optical image is projected by the lenses 

22a and 22b on the detecting surface of the sensor 21.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a code data read
apparatus for photographic film which is capable of reading
a bar code data from a photographic film with a camera or
print station.In photographic printing process, a film is advanced by
a film feeder until its frame to be printed comes to an
exposure means and projected for printing the frame on a
sheet of photosensitive paper which is then subjected to
developing process. For printing a desired picture, its
relevant data, e.g. ID(DX) code and frame number, recorded
in a bar-code format on the negative film is detected and
read with an optical sensor to identify the frame and obtain
the conditions for developing process. To do so, the film
feeder is provided with a light emitter, e.g. LED, and a bar
code detector for reading the bar code of the desired frame
from the film.One of such code data read apparatuses for photographic
film is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication
4-350646 (1992) which employs a CCD line sensor as the bar
code detector. The CCD line sensor scans a target frame of
a negative film to read specific sets of pixels at four
points and simultaneously, identify a bar code from a row of
pixels extending widthwisely of a negative film.Another code data read apparatus for photographic film 
is described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 4-310938
(1992) where an optical image of a bar code is produced
by a light emitter, focused by a lens, and received by
a bar code detector (or sensor). In particular, a slit
plate having a slit opening arranged therein to be smaller
in the width than the smallest stripe of the bar code is
disposed between the lens and the bar code detector. As the
bar code detector receives an intensity of light passed
through the slit, it can read the bar code which has been
recorded at high density.Also, a further code data read apparatus is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 5-19367 (1993)
which employs a specific code detecting method for increasing
the accuracy of reading of a bar code data from a negative
film with no use of any high-precision optical sensor.
According to the code detecting method, the base (blank) and
the code (stripe) of a bar code are detected and converted
to their respective minimum and maximum signals of peak
values with a common optical sensor. The peak values are
then compared with predetermined thresholds to examine
whether or not they represent the base and code of the bar
code.It is important for correctly reading the bar code with
the bar code read

<CLAIMS>
A code data read apparatus, for reading a bar code
consisting of bars and blanks recorded on a photographic

film (F), comprising:

means (2) for feeding a photographic film to pass by
a film position at which a bar code on the film can be

read by the apparatus;
light emitting means (23) positioned on one side of
the film position so as to direct a beam of light to the

bar code of the film;
imaging means (22a, 22b) positioned on the other side
of the film position for focusing light passing through

the bar code such that an enlarged image of the bar code
is formed in an image plane; and
a code data detector (3) with a detecting surface
disposed in said image plane for producing an electric

signal corresponding to the intensity of light incident
on its detecting surface.
A code data read apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein the imaging means comprises two rod lenses (22a,

22b) for tracing two tracks across the bar code and
wherein the detector (3) is such that the enlarged image

of the smallest of the bars or blanks of a normal bar
code recorded on the film (F) is larger in width than the

detecting surface of the detector.
