<ABSTRACT>
Shrouded towers (32) for supporting adjustably 
cantilevered work platforms (40) for performing external 

surface work on ship hulls (such as abrading and painting) 
are modularized (to modules 222-228) for sake of economy 

and efficient utilization, including shifting of modules 
using techniques and equipment currently used for shifting 

shipping containers. Supply and recovery line connections 
between support barg
e-mounted equipment (176), floating 
drydock and work platform-mounted work applicators is 

facilitated by fixed installation of some portions and the 
provision of flexible connectors between these portions. 

Alternative adjustable cantilevering structures are 
disclosed for mounting the work platforms to the vertically 

movable trolleys. Preferably, rotating wheels (316) rather 
than compressed air, are used to propel the abrasive grit 

against the hull surface, and abrasive supply systems 
having degrees of automated recovery of spent grit are 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and 
method of performing surface work on a generally vertical 
surface such as a surface of a ship hull. In general, the invention relates to providing an 
atmospherically controlled sealed enclosure which permits 
economical staging access to and coating of exposed areas 
of ship's hulls of varying configurations both afloat and 
in drydock during the abrasive blasting, spray painting and 
solvent evaporation phases of the coating process so as to 
be, so far as practically possible, in full compliance with 
requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The present invention relates to apparatus and a 
method for surface work such as cleaning and painting, on 
exposed external surfaces of ship hulls, which improve upon 
the apparatus and methods which are disclosed in 
EP-A-0539212, equivalent to Garland et al., U.S. patent 
No. 5,211,125, issued May 18, 1993 and EP-A-0597643, 
equivalent to Goldbach et al, U.S. patent No. 5,355,823. 
These are collectively referred to herein as the baseline 
apparatus and methods. The above US patents were published after the priority 
date claimed by the present European patent. The above 
European patent applications claim priority dates before 
the priority date claimed by the present European patent, 
but were published after that date, and thus should be 
considered in relation to Art. 54(3) EPC.  
 Ship's hulls are very large and are complexly 
contoured in both the vertical and longitudinal 
directions. The world's population of ships has a 
very significant number of different sizes and shapes. Coating of the exteriors of ships requires using 
abrasive blasters for surface preparation and 
painters for application of paint. Both blasters 
and painters must be brought into close proximity 
to the portion of the hull they are working. Neither  
 
blasters nor painters can perform their work on much 
more than 75 square feet (7 m2) of hull surface without 
moving or being moved to another location. In earlier times, worker movement from 
place to place around a ship's hull was accommodated 
by building staging around the ship. Also, in earlier times, the coating of the 
exterior hull above the waterline was most often 
done with the ship afloat. However, enactment in 
the U.S. of the Clean Water Acts all but eliminated 
this practice since coating of this area of a ship 
afloat deposited significantly more spent abrasive 
and paint overspray in the water than did coating in 
a drydock. More
