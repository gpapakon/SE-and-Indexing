<ABSTRACT>
A ferrule structure is disclosed of a 
simplified field assembly optical fiber connector in which 

adhesive material is unnecessary for assembling. 
A sleeve body (1), enclosing the rear end portion of 
a capillary (4), is provided with a window-like and rectangular-shaped 

opening (2) near its mid-point. Both side 
surfaces of the remaining portion of the sleeve body (1) at the 

window section(2)are dented with respect to the other portion 
of the sleeve body (1). The inlaid part (3) is made of 

resilient material and has an opened-rectangular-shaped inner 
surface (14), such that it can be inlaid in the outer surface of 

the dented portion of the sleeve body (1), in other words, the 
window section (2). Along the central axis of the inner 

surface (14), the inlaid part (3) is provided with a groove (15) 
throughout the whole length, such that it can press the 

optical fiber with jacket (18) against the groove (15), when the 
inlaid part (3) is fitted in the window section (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical fiber connector, 
and, more particularly, to a ferrule structure for an optical fiber 
connector which can be mechanically assembled. It is very important to assemble optical fiber 
connectors easily and quickly in the field of installations of 
optical cables for the widespread of optical communication. 
As an example of a conventional technology, we can quote the 
invention appearing in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-8613. In that invention, a short length optical fiber is 
fixed in a ferrule, the end surface of the ferrule having been polished 
previously in the manufacture, and an optical fiber to be 
spliced is mechanically spliced to the one in the ferrule, and 
then assembling can be easily completed. In the simplified 
field assembly optical connector, the polishing process is 
unnecessary in terminating procedure, and assembling of an 
optical fiber can be completed easily within a short time, even 
in a narrow space into which carrying a polishing machine is 
difficult. On the abovementioned ferrule for the optical fiber 
connector, however, the following disadvantages have been pointed 
out. For high and stable performance of the optical fiber 
connector, the optical fiber to be spliced is fixed to the 
inner surface of the ferrule, a light curing adhesive being 
used for this purpose. It is troublesome to handle the  
 
adhesive material, and a high power light source becomes 
necessary at the work area for hardening the adhesive. Accordingly, it is an aim of the invention to 
provide a structure of a ferrule of an optical fiber connector 
in which assembling the optical connector is completed within 
a short time by rendering the adhesive material unnecessary. According to the invention, a connector, comprises:
 
   a structure of a ferrule of an optical fiber 
connector is consisted of a capillary, which has a first 
straight bore containing a previously incorporated short length 
optical fiber, extending from a leading end of the capillary 
to its nearly halfway point, and being supplied with optical 
matching material at its rear end; and
 
   a sleeve body, which is mechanically combined with 
the capillary around a common central axis and has a second 
bore guiding an optical fiber with jacket to be spliced until 
its leading end butts against a rear end of the incorporate 
optical fiber; wherein,
 
   the sleeve body has a third bore with enlarged 
diameter near its leading end, and encloses a rear end portion 
of the capillary, and
 
   has a
