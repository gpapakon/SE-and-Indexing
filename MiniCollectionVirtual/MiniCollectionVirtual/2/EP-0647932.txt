<ABSTRACT>
A graphic board can be inserted into the expansion 
slot of a computer and, when a value is set in 

a register from the computer side, the frequencies of 
horizontal and vertical synchronizing signals can be set 

precisely. At the time of starting display, the display is 
performed at the synchronizing frequency corresponding 

to the display of 640 dots by 400 lines normally 
designed to a CRT display device (step S100). Thereafter, 

the synchronizing frequency is gradually raised to 
the target value corresponding to the display of 640 dots 

x 480 lines (steps S120 to S140). While the synchronizing 
frequency is raised, the CRT display device is 

continuously synchronized despite the deviation of the 
frequency within a tolerance range, because its internal 

synchronous circuit operates. As a result, the CRT display 
device is maintained in the synchronized state until 

the target value is reached and the display of 640 dots 
by 480 lines becomes possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the display
of graphic images of a predetermined number of dots and lines
on connected CRT display devices.A graphic display device for the display of images on a CRT
display device is generally equipped with a video controller
(CRTC) where the resolution (the number of dots by the number
of lines) of a displayed image can be freely set to some
extent. The video controller is equipped with registers for
setting the parameters, such as for the frequencies of a
horizontal synchronizing signal and a vertical synchronizing
signal which are contained in the video signal. The video
controller is connected to a bus of a computer or such device
and the computer can set the values of these registers. The
values corresponding to the number of dots and lines available
for the connected CRT display device are set for these
registers in the video controller as default values or by a
CPU. The video controller generates the video signal which
contains the horizontal synchronizing signal and the vertical
synchronizing signal corresponding to the number of dots and 
lines that are available for the CRT display device based on
the values set for the register; thus the desired image is
displayed on the CRT display device.Along with the spread of such devices as graphical user
interfaces (GUI) in recent years, there is an increasing
demand for a display offering a larger number of dots and
lines of not less than 640 dots by 480 lines. Therefore, a
graphic display device which is to be mounted inside an
expansion slot for an increase in the number of dots and
lines of a conventional device has been proposed.However, for users of such a graphic display device, there
has remained a problem that the number of dots and lines of
the actually displayed image cannot be increased by the
addition of the graphical display device unless the number of
dots and lines available for the CRT display device correspond
to them. Although a CRT display device, named as a
multisynchronization type or such, where the number of dots
and lines to be displayed are variable has been proposed, the
number of dots and lines to be displayed on an ordinary CRT
display device are fixed at certain values (ex. 640 dots by
400 lines); therefore, if the graphic display device outputs
a signal corresponding to a display of 640 dots by 480 lines,
the graphic image cannot be accurately displayed.Further consideration is given to this problem. So long as
the number of images (number of frames) to be displayed in a
