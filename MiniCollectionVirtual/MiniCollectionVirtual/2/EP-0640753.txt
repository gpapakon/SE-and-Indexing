<ABSTRACT>
In a cooling system for an internal combustion engine (10) of a motor vehicle with a radiator (11) and a thermostat valve (15), by means of which the temperature of the coolant can be controlled in warm-up operation, mixed operation and radiator operation, the thermostat valve (15) containing an expansion element, which is electrically heatable for reducing the coolant temperature, the expansion element is designed in such a way that in warm-up operation and/or in mixed operation the coolant temperature is adjusted to an upper working temperature limit without heating of the expansion element. In addition a control unit is provided which, as a function of detected operating and/or environmental variables of the internal combustion engine, triggers the heating of the expansion element as required, in order to shift the operating mode of the cooling system from warm-up operation or from mixed operation at the upper working temperature limit to mixed operation or radiator operation at a coolant temperature lower than the upper working temperature limit.

A cooling system for an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle with a
radiator and a thermostatic valve, with which the temperature of the cooling

medium can be regulated in a hot operation, a mixed operation and a radiator
operation, whereby the thermostatic valve includes an expansion element, which

can be heated electrically to reduce the cooling medium temperature, whereby
the cooling medium temperature (T

design of the expansion element, without heating the expansion element. to a

final temperature, and whereby a control unit (18) is provided, which depending
on captured operational and/or environmental values (DK, n, v, T

element, so as to transfer the mode of operation of the cooling system towards
radiator operation, 
characterised in that
 the regulated final temperature without
heating the expansion element corresponds to the upper limit of working

temperature (T

of the expansion element, which is lower than the upper limit of working

temperature (T

that the control unit (18) captures the actual temperature of the
cooling medium (T

flap opening angle (DK) and the speed of revolution of the motor (n) and if the

actual temperature (T
