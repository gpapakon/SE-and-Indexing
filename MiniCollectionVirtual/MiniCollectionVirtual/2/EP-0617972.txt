<ABSTRACT>
For dermal therapeutic systems with controlled release of active ingredient, polymer mixtures of poly(meth)acrylates are described in which the active-ingredient-controlling polymer component carries functional groups and a further polymer component regulates the melt, flow and adhesion behaviour of the therapeutic system.

Layered dermal therapeutic system with delayed
release of the active substance, having at least one

pharmaceutically active substance, 
characterised in that

one or more layers are made up of mixtures of
poly(meth)acrylates and are prepared from a melt and

component 1 of the mixture consists of (meth)acrylic
polymers, which are copolymers of methacrylic esters and

acrylic esters and optionally also other vinyl monomers
with monomers having functional groups, as a result of

which the polymers have a cationic, anionic or
hydrophilic nature, and component 2 of the mixture

consists of polymers which are essentially made up of
C
1
-C
12
-alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid, or are
copolymers of ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate

with about 5% trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate
chloride which regulate the flow properties.
Dermal therapeutic system according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the polymers of component 2 of the
mixture have glass transition temperatures according to

DIN 53445 of -70 to +80°C, predominantly from +10 to
70°C.
Dermal therapeutic system according to claims 1 to
2, 
characterised in that
 the system of polymer/active
substance also contains low-molecular plasticisers.
Process for preparing a dermal therapeutic system
according to claims 1 to 3, by mixing the solids of the

polymer components, the active substance and optionally 
other additives, heating the mixture till it melts and

formulating the therapeutic system from the molten mass
by spreading it out as a thin layer, on any substrate

which remains or on a protective film which is removed.
before use.
