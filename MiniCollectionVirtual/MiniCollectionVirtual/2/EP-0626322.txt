A foil sheet (2) for blister packs (1) in which the
foil sheet (2) seals the packaged product, but can be

torn open or broken open by means of pressing the
packaged product through the foil sheet, 
characterized
in that
 the material that forms the foil sheet (2) is a
mixture of plastics that forms fluid phases in the melt

and at least two phases, hence inhomogenities, in the
foil sheet formed thereafter.
A foil sheet as claimed in claim 1, characterized by
comprising a mixture of polyolefins and other polymers.
A foil sheet as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the mixture of plastics that

forms the foil sheet (2) comprises a combination of 10%
to 90%, particularly 40% to 70% polyolefins (non-polar

polymers), and 90% to 10%, particularly 60% to 30%
other polymers (polar polymers).
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the plastic mixture that forms

the foil sheet (2) comprises polypropylene (PP)
and/or polyethylene (PE) and/or ethylene vinylacetate

(EVA) on the one hand, and polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) and/or polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and/or

acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (ABS)
and/or styrene-acrylonitrile block copolymer (SAN)

and/or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on the other hand.
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized by being capable of being welded or

sealed with other plastic foils or the like. 
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the mixture that forms the foil

sheet contains a larger proportion of PMMA, PVC, ABS
and/or SAN for weldability without bonding agents to

foils or the like made of PVC, ABS, PAN and/or PS
(polystyrene).
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the mixture that forms the foil

sheet contains a larger proportion of polyolefins for
weldability without bonding agents to PP foils or the

like.
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the foil sheet (2) is coated

with, for example, PVDC (polyvinylidene chloride), SiO
or aluminium to improve the barrier properties against

gas, water vapour and the like.
A foil sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the thickness of the foil sheet

is approximately 20 to 500 µ, in particular
approximately 60 to 300 µ.
