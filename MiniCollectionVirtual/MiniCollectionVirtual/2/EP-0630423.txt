<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method of bonding
together components of a sputter target-backing plate
assembly.Cathodic sputtering is widely used for the
deposition of thin layers of material onto desired
substrates. Basically, this process requires a gas ion
bombardment of the target having a face formed of a
desired material that is to be deposited as a thin film
or layer on a substrate. Ion bombardment of the target
not only causes atoms or molecules of the target material
to be sputtered, but imparts considerable thermal energy
to the target. This heat is dissipated by use of a
cooling fluid typically circulated beneath or around a
backing plate that is positioned in heat exchange
relation with the target.The target forms a part of a cathode assembly
which together with an anode is placed in an evacuated
chamber that contains an inert gas, preferably argon. A
high voltage electrical field is applied across the
cathode and anode. The inert gas is ionized by collision
with the electrons ejected from the cathode. Positively
charged gas ions are attracted to the cathode and, upon
impingement with the target surface, dislodge the target
material. The dislodged target materials traverse the
evacuated enclosure and deposit as a thin film on the
desired substrate that is normally located proximate the
anode.In addition to the use of an electrical field,
increasing sputtering rates have been achieved by the
concurrent use of an arch-shaped magnetic field that is 
superimposed over the electrical field and formed in a
closed loop configuration over the surface of the target.
These methods are known as magnetron sputtering methods.
The arch-shaped magnetic field traps electrons in an
annular region adjacent the target surface thereby
increasing the number of electron-gas atom collisions in
the area to produce an increase in the number of
positively charged gas ions in the region that strike the
target to dislodge the target material. Accordingly, the
target material becomes eroded (i.e., consumed for
subsequent deposition on the substrate) in a generally
annular section of the target face, known as the target
race-way.In conventional target cathode assemblies, the
target is attached to a nonmagnetic backing plate. The
backing plate is normally water-cooled to carry away the
heat generated by the ion bombardment of the target.
Magnets are typically arranged beneath the backing plate
in well-known dispositions in order to form the above-noted
magnetic field in the form of a loop or tunnel
extending around the
