<ABSTRACT>
A method for generating a filtered noise signal, which includes the steps of generating a broadband signal having optimized (reduced or minimized) dynamic range, and filtering the broadband signal in a notch filter (35B) to generate a broadband signal whose frequency-amplitude spectrum has one or more notches. In preferred embodiments, the filtered noise signal is a voltage signal suitable for application to an ion trap (16) during a mass spectrometry operation. The invention enables rapid generation of different filtered noise signals by filtering a single, optimized broadband signal using a set of different notch filters, each having a simple, easily implementable design. Digital values indicative of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of each sinusoidal (or other periodic) component of an optimized broadband signal can be iteratively generated by a digital computer in accordance with the invention, and the digital values can then be processed to generate an analog version of the optimized broadband signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for generating
a filtered noise broadband
signal having a reduced or low dynamic range referred- to as an
optimised broadband signal in mass spectrometry applications.In a class of conventional mass spectrometry
techniques, ions having mass-to-charge ratios within
a selected range (or set of ranges) are isolated in
an ion trap, and the trapped ions are then excited
for detection. In conventional variations on such
techniques, ions trapped during a first (mass storage) step are
allowed or induced to react (or dissociate) to produce other
ions, and the other ions are excited for detection during a
second (mass analysis) step.For example, US-A-4,736,101,
(Syka, et al.), discloses a mass spectrometry
method in which ions (having a mass-to charge ratio within a
predetermined range) are 
trapped within a three-dimensional quadrupole trapping field.
The trapping field is then scanned to eject unwanted parent
ions (ions other than parent ions having a desired
mass-to-charge ratio) consecutively from the trap. The
trapping field is then changed again to become capable of
storing daughter ions of interest. The trapped parent ions
are then induced to dissociate to produce daughter
ions, and the daughter ions are ejected consecutively
(sequentially by m/z) from the trap for detection.It is often useful to apply broadband voltage signals to
an ion trap to eject unwanted ions from the trap during
performance of any (or all) of the ion storage, ion reaction or
dissociation, and ion analysis steps of a mass spectrometry
operation.For example, US-A-5,134,826,
describes a mass spectrometry method in which a
filtered noise signal (a broadband voltage signal which has
been filtered in a notch-filter) is applied to electrodes of an
ion trap. The filtered noise signal can be applied during the
mass storage step to resonantly eject all ions except selected
parent ions out of the region of the trapping field. After
application of the filtered noise signal, the only ions
remaining (in significant concentrations) in the trap are
parent ions having mass-to-charge ratios whose corresponding
resonant frequencies fall within a notch region of the
frequency-amplitude spectrum of the filtered noise signal.US-A-4,761,545,
(Marshall, et al.), also discloses application of a
broadband signal to an ion trap during performance of
a mass spectrometry operation. Marshall et al. teach
(at, for example, column 14, lines 12-14) application 
of a broadband signal having a notched excitation profile to an
ion
