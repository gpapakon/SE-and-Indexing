<ABSTRACT>
An impact protection element (1) for protecting a part of the 
user's body, particularly of an athlete, said element being a shin 

protector, a protection element for the arm or a part thereof, the 
pelvis, the femur, the spinal column or another part of the user's 

body, said element being of concave form at that part (2A) facing 
the user, and comprising a body (2) consisting of at least one 

layer (3) of high-rigidity composite material and at least one 
inner layer (4) of soft material facing the user, the body (2) 

being of anatomical shape so as to adapt to that part of the 
wearing user's body on which the protection element (1) is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an impact protection element for 
protecting a part of the user's body, particularly of an athlete, 
in accordance with the introduction to the main claim. Protection elements of the aforesaid type are known. These 
elements, such as shin protectors, are generally of a form 
deriving from a hollow half-cylinder so as to be able to be placed 
about the part of the body to be protected and contain it. Said protection elements are generally constructed of soft 
material (which with use is however subject to considerable wear 
and tearing, and does not provide high protection for the part 
about which it is placed) or of rigid material. Although this latter rigid type of protection element offers 
considerable protection to the user, it has various drawbacks. In 
particular, with an element of this type, such as a shin protector 
worn by a skier during a competition, if it undergoes impact (for 
example against a usual post fixed into the snow, and which the 
athlete is required to clear), this impact results in pressure 
which is distributed over the protection element only at those 
points at which this latter comes into contact with the impacting 
element (the post). The result is that the athlete senses this 
impact only at particular points of the leg to which the shin 
protector is fitted. There is therefore greater probability of 
muscular complications (such as small traumas) or microfractures  
 
occurring at these points, which in the long term can compromise a 
single competition, a whole competitive season or indeed the 
actual sporting career of the athlete. An object of the present invention is to provide an element of the 
aforesaid type which offers greater protection to the user against 
impact, and which displays considerable mechanical and structural 
strength with time. A further object is to provide a protection element of the 
aforesaid type which is lightweight and can be used either 
directly in contact with the user's body, or positioned on a suit 
worn by the user, or "embedded" within the suit itself. A further object is to provide a protection element which can be 
easily attached to the suit worn by the user. These and further objects which will be apparent to the expert of 
the art are attained by a protection element in accordance with 
the accompanying claims. In particular, the protection element of the invention provides 
greater and improved protection to the user by virtue of its 
anatomical shape, which, in the case of localised impact against

<CLAIMS>
An impact protection element for protecting a part of the 
user's body, particularly of an athlete, said element being a shin 

protector, a protection element for the arm or a part thereof, the 
pelvis, the femur, the spinal column or another part of the user's 

body, said element being of concave form at that part facing the 
user, characterised by comprising a body (2) consisting of at 

least one outer layer (3) of high-rigidity composite material and 
at least one inner layer (4) of soft material facing the user, the 

body (2) being of anatomical shape so as to adapt to that part of 
the wearing user's body on which the protection element (1) is 

used. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the outer layer (3) is formed of carbon or glass fibres or 

similar material. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the inner layer (4) is of polyurethane foam preferably of 

high density and/or differential density. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the inner layer (4) is of sponge rubber. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by comprising, on the outer surface (9) of the outer layer (3), 

projections (6, 13) in end positions and raised stiffening ribs 
(8, 15) on said surface. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 

by comprising means (16) for its connection to the user's body. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by being removably associated with an article of sports clothing 

worn by the user. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 7, characterised 
by being provided, on the inner part (2A) of its body (2), with 

members (20) for fastening the element to corresponding members 
associated with the article of clothing worn by the user. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by being permanently associated with an article of sports clothing 

worn by the user. 
A protection element as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by being embedded within the article of clothing worn by the user, 

the inner layer (4) of its body (2) consisting at least of a part 
of the article of clothing itself.
