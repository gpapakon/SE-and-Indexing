<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting rotational power from a
rotational power source to a driven device having a drive

shaft includes at least one elastic connecting member
defining outer and inner peripheral surfaces. First and

second holder members radially cooperate with each other
to circumferentially hold the at least one elastic

connecting member during normal operation to transmit the
rotation, and are disconnected by the deformation of the

at least one elastic connecting member when the torque on
the drive shaft exceeds a predetermined cutoff torque

level. A weakened portion is provided at least one of
the first and second holder members. The weakened

portion aids the deformation of at least one of the first
and second holder members to reduce a torsional spring

coefficient which is defined by the ratio of the relative
rotational angle between the first and second holder

member to the torque on the drive shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for transmitting
rotational power from a rotational power source such as
an automobile engine to a rotational driven device such
as a refrigerant compressor for an air conditioner. The
device can rotationally separate the driven device from
the rotational power source when the torque transmitted
exceeds a predetermined cutoff torque level, that is, the
device functions as a torque limiter.
GB 801 998 A discloses a device for transmitting rotational power from a
rotational power source to a driven device having a drive shaft, the device for
transmitting rotational power comprising at least one elastic connecting member
defining outer and inner peripheral surface. Further, it comprises a first holder
member, for holding the at least one elastic connecting member at the radially
outer or inner periphery of the at least one elastic connecting member, the first
holder member being connected to the drive shaft. A second holder member, for
holding the at least one elastic connecting member at the radially inner or outer
periphery of the at least one elastic connecting member, is connected to the
rotational power source. The first and second holder members radially
cooperate with each other to circumferentially hold the at least one elastic
connecting member during normal operation to transmit the rotation, and being
disconnected by the deformation of the at least one elastic connecting member
when the torque on the drive shaft exceeds a predetermined cutoff torque level. A
weakened portion is provided in at least one of the first and second holder member
for aiding the deformation of the at least
one of the first and second members
to reduce a
torsional spring coefficient which is defined by the ratio of the relative rotational
angle between the first and second holder members to the torque on the drive
shaft. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No.
8-135752 describes a rotational power transmission device
which can limit the maximum torque transmission and
absorb a fluctuation in the torque. The device transmits
rotational power from a rotational power source, such as
an automobile engine, to a driven device, such as a
compressor used in an automobile air conditioning system.
The device comprises an elastic connecting member
defining radially outer and inner peripheral surfaces.
First and second holder members are provided to radially
cooperate with each other to circumferentially hold the
elastic connecting member during normal operation to
transmit the rotation,
