<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air regulator systems
and the method of operating these systems for regulating
one or more air streams used in operating a powder coating
system.EP-A-0180999 discloses an apparatus for
controlling the supply of compressed fluid to an actuator.
Two control valves are connected to the actuator and are
driven in parallel by respective pulse width modulation
circuits to provide a quick response.There are numerous systems in the operation of
which a plurality of air streams are employed. For
example, a number of different air streams are used in
operating a powder coating system. Typically, powder
coating systems include a powder pump for transporting air
entrained powder through a pneumatic conveyor line to a
powder spray gun. Within the powder pump there is a low
pressure venturi pumping chamber. This chamber is
intersected by a flow air, or ejector air, passage which
creates the low pressure condition in the venturi pumping
chamber to transport the powder through the pump, and by 
a powder supply passage through which powder is supplied
(i.e., sucked) through a suction tube extending from the
pump into a fluidized bed of powder within a powder
supply hopper. The powder within the hopper is fluidized
by fluidizing air supplied to an air plenum located below
a fluidizing plate at the bottom of the hopper. In order
to meter or control the rate of powder flow from the
fluidized bed into the venturi pumping chamber, the
powder pump usually includes a diffusing or atomizing air
stream which injects a controlled flow of air into the
powder supply passage. This diffuser air flow controls
the amount of air which is mixed with the powder entering
the venturi chamber to adjust the powder/air mixture
being transported through the pump.A powder spray system can thus incorporate three
separate, controlled air streams for operating the
system, namely, the fluidizing air stream, the diffusing
air stream, and the flow air stream. Each of these three
air streams can operate independently at different
pressures. At the same time, these three air streams
interact together to determine the powder flow rate of
powder supplied to the powder coating gun. The pressures
of the air streams are individually adjusted to
compensate for such factors as the type of powder being
sprayed, the product being coated, the type of gun being
used, the position of the gun relative to the product,
and the like. It is, therefore, important that the air
pressure for each of these air streams be capable of
variation to
