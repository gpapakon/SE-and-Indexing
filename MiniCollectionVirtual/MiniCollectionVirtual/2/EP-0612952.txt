<ABSTRACT>
Quick-acting closure (2) for connecting pipelines for installations for conveying pressurised gases or fluids, composed of a first component (15) which exhibits, at one end, a projecting connecting piece (17) which can be connected to a second component (3) provided with a cutout. Provided in the second component (3) is a sleeve (7) which can be displaced counter to the force of a spring (5) and exhibits, on the front side of the component (3), a thickening (7a) for forming a valve seat which interacts with a valve body (12) which is connected, on its side directed towards the inner side of the component (3), to a plate (14) which is connected to a sleeve (8) bearing displaceably on a spring (6), and the connecting piece (17) of the first component (15) exhibits, on its circumferential side, a groove (16) into which, with the part (15, 17) inserted, the balls (9) of a ball ring, arranged in the component (3), penetrate, and said ball ring (9) is covered by an actuating sleeve (10), loaded by a spring (11), by means of a radially inwardly deformed shoulder (10a) for blocking the balls (9) in the circumferential groove (16) of the inserted component (15).
