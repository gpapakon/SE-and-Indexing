<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a three-pass boiler, consisting of a water-conveying housing with combustion chamber (6), deflection chamber (13) and, emerging from the latter, a third pass (1) leading to the flue-gas connection (5). For the purpose of a simple construction of such a boiler for condensing operation, without having to alter its design significantly, the third pass (1) is separated to individual pipes which are joined together by connecting flanges (7) to form a constructional unit which can be prefabricated and completely inserted or welded into the casing.

A three-flue boiler, comprising a water-carrying housing (12) with combustion
chamber (6), reversing chamber (3) and a third flue (1) emerging from the latter chamber

(3) and leading to the exhaust gas connection (5), with the flue (1) being formed of
several small-diameter tubes (2) of a condensate-resistant material, characterised in that

the third flue (1), from the reversing chamber (3), is guided, with slope, to the exhaust
gas side (5) of the boiler provided with a condensate discharge connection (4), with the

ends (10,10') of the tubes (2) being inserted into connecting flanges (7,7') of a
condensate-resistant material and the said flanges (7,7') formed with the tubes (2) as a

unit ready for assembly being welded into corresponding openings of the housing walls
(8,9).
A three-flue boiler according to claim 1, characterised in that the tubes (2) are
circularly arranged as a tubular package (2') to extend above the combustion chamber

(6), terminating on the exhaust side in the exhaust connection (5) arranged on the
housing rear wall (9) and provided with the condensate discharge connection (4).
A three-flue boiler according to claim 2, characterised in that the exhaust gas
connection (5) equally formed of a condensate-resistant material is formed as an integral

unit of the connecting flange (7') provided on the exhaust side.
A three-flue boiler according to claim 1, characterised in that the tubes (2) are
arranged underneath the combustion chamber (6) on a circular arc (6") concentric with

the axis (6') ofthe combustion chamber and, with the ends (10') thereof, terminate on
the exhaust side in a condensate collecting chamber (11) of a condensate-resistant

material which is provided with an exhaust gas connection (5) and a condensate
discharge (4). 
A three-flue boiler according to claim 4, characterised in that the tubes (2), with the
ends (10') thereof, pass through the flange (7') arranged within the housing rear wall (9),

and that the condensate collecting chamber (11) is secured to the protruding ends (10').
A three-flue boiler according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
flange (7') on the exhaust side is larger sized than the front flange (7).
