<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ecologically acceptable light-stabilizers 
for use in thermal dye sublimation transfer and to a 
method of forming a light-fast dye image by thermal dye sublimation 
transfer. Thermal dye transfer methods include thermal dye sublimation 
transfer also called thermal dye diffusion transfer. This is a 
recording method in which a dye-donor element provided with a dye 
layer containing sublimating dyes having heat transferability is 
brought into contact with a receiver sheet and selectively, in 
accordance with a pattern information signal, heated with a thermal 
printing head provided with a plurality of juxtaposed heat-generating 
resistors, whereby dye is transferred from the 
selectively heated regions of the dye-donor element to the receiver 
sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape and density of which 
are in accordance with the pattern and intensity of heat applied to 
the dye-donor element. A dye-donor element for use according to thermal dye 
sublimation transfer usually comprises a very thin support e.g. a 
polyester support, one side of which is covered with a dye layer 
comprising the printing dyes. Usually, an adhesive or subbing layer 
is provided between the support and the dye layer. Normally, the 
opposite side of the support is covered with a slipping layer that 
provides a lubricated surface against which the thermal printing 
head can pass without suffering abrasion. An adhesive layer may be 
provided between the support and the slipping layer. The dye layer can be a monochromic dye layer or it may comprise 
sequential repeating areas of differently coloured dyes e.g. dyes 
having a cyan, magenta, yellow, and optionally black hue. When a 
dye-donor element containing three or more primary colour dyes is 
used, a multicolour image can be obtained by sequentially performing 
the dye transfer process steps for each colour. A primary coloured dye layer e.g. a magenta or cyan or yellow 
dye layer may comprise only one primary coloured dye (a magenta, 
cyan, or yellow dye respectively) or may comprise a mixture of two  
 
or more primary coloured dyes of the same hue (two magenta, two 
cyan, or two yellow dyes respectively). All imaging dyes are unstable to light to some extent. Dyes 
are indeed known to degrade through a number of pathways, which 
often involve dye triplet states, radicals and/or singlet oxygen. 
Any improvement in the light stability of dyes is highly desirable 
therefore. In photographic silver halide systems various light-stabilizers
