<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toe cap for a protective shoe and, more
particularly, to a reinforced, injection molded plastic toe cap.For many years, toe caps for protective shoes have been made of thin
steel sheets formed into shoe toe-shaped bodies which are sewn or
otherwise attached on the inside of the leather toe cap of a shoe or boot.
Steel toe caps are known to deform under vertically applied compressive
or impact loads and to undertake a permanent set which, if excessive,
may result in a crushing and/or cutting injury to the toes of the wearer.
Attempts have been made more recently to substitute various plastic
materials for steel in safety toe caps and number of prior art patents show
such constructions.One of the more relevant prior art patents is Dykeman 4,735,003 which
describes a molded plastic toe cap made of a variety of thermoplastic
and thermosetting resins, both with and without fiber reinforcement. The
body of the toe cap is provided with a flexible roof region, the deflection
of which under load is intended to shift stresses to the lateral and
forward wall regions which are generally heavier and more capable of
supporting the loads.GB 2138272 describes a toe cap for a shoe. The toe cap is a fiber-filled
plastics injection molding and includes a roof which blends smoothly
into opposite lateral side walls, and a front wall. The edges of the roof
and side walls together define an open rear end.In the United States, suitability of toe caps for new protective footwear is
determined in accordance with American National Standard for Personal
- Protection Protective Footwear (ANSI Z41-1991). This Standard 
provides, inter alia, for separate compression and impact tests, both of
which apply vertical loads to the roof of the toe cap actually installed In
a shoe or boot. Similar but somewhat more rigorous standards are
applicable in Canada under Canadian Standards Association toe impact
test Z-195 March 1984. In Europe, the test regimen is dictated by DIN
standards.The rigorous test regimens to which protective toe caps are subject has it
made extremely difficult to design and build a toe cap of either steel or
plastic which will consistently meet any one of the standards, much less
all of them. The problem is exacerbated by variations in toe caps styles
in the United States and between the United States, Canada and Europe.
These styles are, in turn, dictated to some extent by variations in the
styles and in the construction of shoes, both work shoes and dress shoes
which are modified to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An injection molded toe cap (10) for a protective shoe of the
type having a rearwardly opening shoe toe-shaped body (13) including a

roof (14) which blends smoothly in curved transition regions into
opposite lateral generally vertical side walls (16) and a generally vertical

front wall (15), said toe cap comprising a fiber-filled plastic resin body
(13), characterized in that a major amount of the fibers (F) in the resin

forming the roof (14) are oriented in a generally lateral direction between
the side walls (16), the toe cap including a slot (21) extending along the

front wall (15) defining a region of substantially reduced cross section
(24) in the front wall (15) for causing a controlled collapse of the toe cap

upon the application of a vertical downward load to the roof (14).
A toe cap as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said slot (21)

comprises an elongate generally horizontal slot.
A toe cap as claimed in Claim 1, including gate means (18) in
the rear edge (20) of the body (13) for admitting the fiber-filled plastic

resin to form the injection molded body.
A toe cap as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said gate means
comprises a gate opening (18) positioned generally between the roof (14)

and one of the side walls (16).
A method for injection molding a toe cap (10) for a protective
shoe, said cap having a rearwardly opening shoe toe-shaped body (13)

including a roof (14) which blends smoothly into opposite lateral
generally vertical side walls (16) and a generally vertical front wall (15), 

and an open rear end defined by a rear edge (20) including the rear
edges of the roof and side walls, said method comprising the step of:


(a) injecting a molten fiber-filled plastic resin under
pressure into a toe cap shaped mold; and characterized by the step of:
(b) controlling the injecting step by providing a resin
injection gate (18) in direct communication with the rear edge (20) of the

toe cap to cause a major amount of the fibers (F) in the resin forming the
roof (14) to be oriented in a generally lateral direction between the side

walls (16).
