<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims to increase the rigidity 
of a tire sidewall portion without an additional 

reinforcing member and to make the tire sidewall 
flexible. 
The tire (1) in accordance with the invention has a 
carcass (7) made of at least one carcass ply (3) turned 

up around bead cores (4) and rubber fillers (5) from the 
inside to the outside and overlapped at the crown (6). 

Also the tire has at least one reinforcing layer (9) 
around the overlapped portion (10) of the carcass (7) 

and the reinforcing layer is made of rubberized cords 
(8) spirally wound and disposed substantially parallel 

with the tire equatorial plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire, 
and in particular to a pneumatic tire having a rigid 
sidewall portion and also having flexibility of the 
sidewall portion. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a pneumatic tire for two wheel vehicles. The 
pneumatic tire for use with two wheel vehicles (i. e. 
motorcycles) is usually characterised in that the tread 
width is greater than the maximum width of the sidewall 
of the tire. The carcass of a pneumatic tire has an important 
role in maintaining tire shape. In general, carcass 
ply(ies) are turned up around bead cores from the inside 
to the outside and terminate at the sidewall area. The 
flexibility of the sidewall portion is adversely 
affected if edges of the carcass ply(ies) are located at 
the sidewall area, because there exists step-wise 
rigidity. In this case, the flexibility of the sidewall 
portion can be easily improved by reduction of the 
sidewall rubber thickness. However, if the sidewall 
rubber is very thin, repeated deformation under load 
will bring about stress concentration and consequently 
cracks at the sidewall, and finally edges of the carcass 
ply(ies) may be in danger of exposure outside the 
sidewall surface. Therefore, means other than reduction  
 
of the sidewall rubber thickness are required to improve 
the flexibility of the sidewall portion.. On the other hand, to maintain good and stable 
steering characteristics (manoeuvrability) at cornering, 
high rigidity of the sidewall is required. For this 
purpose, it is useful (a) to increase the thickness of 
the sidewall rubber, (b) to increase the number of the 
carcass plies, and (c) to overlap the carcass plies 
after turn-up. Both (a) and (b) mentioned above are not preferable 
because (a) tends to adversely affect the flexibility of 
the tire sidewall portion and (b) considerably adversely 
affects the tire building efficiency and therefore 
productivity. There are some difficulties in the case 
of (c), namely if a tire is simply constructed with the 
carcass made of one carcass ply turned-up and 
overlapped, sufficient tire rigidity is not obtained. An object of the present invention is to develop a 
pneumatic tire of the above type (c) having a carcass 
made of one or a small number of carcass plies which are 
turned up around bead cores from the inside to the 
outside and overlapped at the crown portion while 
eliminating or at least mitigating the above-mentioned 
difficulties and imparting flexibility to the sidewall  
 
portion. Attention is
