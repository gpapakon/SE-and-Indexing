<ABSTRACT>
A column selector (34) of a dynamic random access 
memory device is implemented by a plurality of switching 

circuits (341-34m) for transferring a potential difference 
from a sense amplifier (SA1-SAm) to a shared data line pair 

(DL1/DL2), and one of the switching circuits selectively 
discharge the data lines (DL1/DL2) of the pair to a ground 

voltage line (GND) for transferring the potential 
difference to the shared data line pair, wherein a 

potential control circuit (37) is coupled between the 
switching circuits and the ground voltage line for 

decreasing the current (I) flowing from the data line to 
the ground voltage line after production of an output data 

signal (Dout), thereby decreasing the current consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dynamic random access
memory device and, more particularly, to a dynamic random
access memory device having a low-power consumption column
selector for transferring a potential difference on a
selected bit line pair to a data line pair.A typical example of the dynamic random access memory
device is illustrated in figure 1 of the drawings, and the
prior art dynamic random access memory device largely
comprises a first memory cell array 1, a second memory cell
array 2, an array of sense amplifier circuits SA1 to SAn
shared between the first and second memory cell arrays 1
and 2, a first transfer gate array 3 associated with the
first memory cell array 1, a second transfer gate array 4
associated with the second memory cell array 2, a column
selector 5 for selectively coupling the sense amplifier
circuits SA1 to SAn through a data line pair DL to a data
amplifier circuit 6 and a charging circuit 7 for the data
line pair DL. Although the prior art dynamic random access
memory device further comprises a write-in circuit etc., 
figure 1 does not show these circuits, because they are less
important for understanding problems inherent in the prior
art dynamic random access memory device.The first memory cell array 1 is implemented by a
plurality of memory cells for storing data bits in the form
of potential difference, and the memory cells are indicated
by small circles. A plurality of bit line pairs BLa1,
BLa2,... and BLan are selectively coupled with the
input/output nodes of the memory cells, and word lines WLa
are further selectively coupled to the control nodes of the
memory cells. The word lines WLa are selectively driven to
an active level, and the stored data bits are transferred
from the associated memory cells to the bit line pairs BLa1
to BLan.The second memory cell array 2 is also arranged.
Namely, a plurality of memory cells form a matrix, and are
selectively coupled to a plurality of word lines WLb1/ WLb2
and a plurality of digit line pairs BLb1, BLb2,... and
BLbn. If one of the word lines such as WLb1 is energized,
the associated memory cells delivers the stored data bits
to the bit line pairs, respectively.The first transfer gate array 3 has a plurality of
sets of n-channel enhancement type transfer transistors 
Qn1/Qn2 coupled between the bit line pairs BLa1 to BLan and
the sense amplifier circuits SA1 to SAn, and a first
transfer signal TG1 causes the n-channel enhancement type
transfer transistors Qn1/Qn2 to concurrently turn on for
coupling the sense amplifier
