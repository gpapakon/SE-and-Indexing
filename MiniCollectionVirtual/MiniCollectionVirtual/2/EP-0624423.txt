<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of separating at least one piece from a super hard 
material plate having top and bottom surfaces, comprising providing a laser capable of 

cutting said super hard material plate; making a cut with said laser through the top 
surface of said plate, said cut defining the shape of the piece to be separated and being 

to a depth which is less than the overall thickness of said plate; and separating said 
piece from said plate by applying an effective amount of pressure to said plate along 

the line of said cut to separate the uncut portion of said plate adjacent said cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for separating pieces from a super hard material 
plate by partially cutting the plate with a laser along the top of the plate and then 
subsequently cleaving the uncut portion by applying pressure to the plate along the line 
of the cut. More particularly, the invention relates to the separation of diamond 
devices, especially heat sinks for semiconductor devices, from diamond plates. Lasers have been used to cut, scribe and etch various materials. U.S. Patent 
5,168,143 describes the cutting of metal plates with a laser. The laser cutting of glass 
is described in U.S. Patents 4,467,168 and 4,682,003. The cutting and machining of 
ceramics with a laser are described in U.S. Patents 4,169,976 and 5,138,130. Lasers have also been effective in the cutting or scribing of super hard materials 
such as diamonds. U.S. Patents 4,467,172 and 5,149,938 disclose the inscribing of 
diamonds with lasers. U.S. Patent 5,012,067 discloses a method for cutting synthetic 
diamond workpieces. Its hardness, thermal and electrical properties have made diamond useful in a 
variety of industrial applications. The high heat conductance and excellent electrical 
insulation properties of natural and synthetic diamond make it ideal for use as heat sinks 
for electronic components. Presently the manufacture of diamond based heat sinks as well as other diamond 
based devices involves forming a plurality of the devices on a synthetic diamond plate 
and separating the individual devices from the plate. The synthetic diamond may be 
formed by a high pressure/high temperature method (HP/HT) or by a low pressure  
 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The individual devices are separated from 
the plate by cutting through the entire thickness of the plate with a laser. This method of separating the devices from the plate presents two problems. First, 
as the diamond is cut by the laser graphite deposits are left on the walls of the cut. 
Graphite is an electrical conductor which when deposited on the cut walls tends to 
induce electrical conductivity between features of the device which are designed to be 
electrically isolated. Additionally, there may occur electrical conductance between the 
top and bottom surfaces of the device. Both situations lead to an increase in device 
failure because of the difficulty in removing the graphite. Second, the devices are handled manually after cutting because of the difficulty of 
automating the cleaning and processing of the individual devices. This leads
