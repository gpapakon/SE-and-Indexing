<ABSTRACT>
Use of a dual functionality, dual curing adhesive composition 
comprising a half-acrylated diepoxy resin having a bisphenol A backbone 

as a side sealant in the manufacture of a liquid crystal display. The 
composition contains an epoxy latent hardener. The adhesive is 

initially cured by UV light and then further cured by heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
liquid crystal display using a dual functionality, dual curing adhesive 
composition. The invention further relates to the use of a dual 
functionality, dual curing adhesive composition in the manufacture of 
liquid crystal displays. The operation of a liquid crystal display (LCD) relies on the 
electro-optical effect of a liquid crystal material which is housed 
between two sheets of glass, each of which has a polarising filter 
whose planes of polarisation are displaced from each other. The 
optical characteristics of the liquid crystal are controlled by an 
electric field which is applied via electrodes housed within the 
display. Adhesive compositions have several applications in LCD 
assembly. Firstly, an adhesive material is used to bond the front and 
rear glass sheets together and acts as a gasket or side sealant 
confining the liquid crystal material within the display. A small gap 
is left in the gasket or side seal through which the liquid crystal 
material is filled once the display is assembled. This charge port is 
sealed after the introduction of the liquid crystal by a small amount 
of adhesive.  Adhesive material is also used to bond the electrode terminals to 
the display. At present, it is usual to use a heat curable side sealant which 
can require cure cycles of up to 1 to 5 hours at approximately 150 to 
180Â°C, while holding the display mechanically in absolute alignment. JP-A-58 105 124 (Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol 7, No 210 
(P-233)(1355)) describes the production of a liquid crystal display 
panel using a sealing resin mixture which combines thermosetting 
adhesive agents, such as epoxy adhesive agents, and UV adhesive curing 
agents. After application of the mixture to substrates at a controlled 
spacing, UV curing is carried out first, the quality condition is then 
checked, and heat curing is carried out subsequently. However the 
present applicants have found in tests that such a mixture of resins is 
unsatisfactory because uncured epoxy resin migrates to the surface 
during or after the UV curing stage, resulting in a wet surface which 
leads to a risk of contamination and also to an unsatisfactory final 
cure if hardener has not migrated with the epoxy resin. U.S. Patent No. 3,753,755 assigned to Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing Company discloses a composition comprising a thermo-settable 
resin system containg both acrylic-type unsaturation and epoxy 
groups, an elastomeric copolymer, and an acrylic/epoxy

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display comprising the 
steps of 


a) applying a sealant composition to a first substrate in a pattern 
to define a side seal for confining liquid crystal but with a 

charge port therein, wherein said sealant composition is a dual 
functionality, dual curing adhesive composition comprising; 


(i) a resin having a bisphenol A backbone with a functional 
end group curable by ultraviolet light and a functional 

end group curable by heat on the same backbone; 
(ii) a UV curing agent; and 
(iii) a latent hardener; 
b) bringing a second substrate into contact with the adhesive but 
with a gap between the two substrates so that the two substrates 

and the side seal define a housing for the liquid crystal; 
c) subjecting the adhesive to an initial cure by irradiation with 
ultraviolet light; and 
d) subsequently subjecting the adhesive to a heat curing step. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the resin is a half-acrylated 
diepoxy resin. 
A method according to Claim 2 wherein the adhesive comprises the 
half-acrylated diepoxy resin in an amount of from 40 to 80% by weight 

of the total adhesive composition. 
A method according to claim 3 wherein the adhesive comprises the 
half-acrylated diepoxy resin in an amount of from 50 to 70% by weight 

of the total adhesive composition. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the adhesive composition 
further comprises at least one modifying resin selected from acrylic 

resins and epoxy resins in an amount of from 5 to 30% by weight of 
 

the total adhesive composition. 
A method according to claim 5 wherein the modifying resin is 
present in an amount of from 10 to 25% by weight of the total 

composition. 
A method according to claim 6 wherein the modifying resin is 
present in an amount of from 15 to 20% by weight of the total adhesive 

composition. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the latent hardener is 
present in a range of 5-45 parts per 100 parts of resin. 
Use of a dual functionality, dual curing adhesive composition 
comprising 


(i) a resin having a bisphenol A backbone with a functional 
end group curable by ultraviolet light and a functional 

end group curable by heat on the same backbone; 
(ii) a UV curing agent; and 
(iii) a latent hardener; 
 
in the manufacture of a liquid crystal display. 
A sealant composition for use as a side sealant in the manufacture 
of a liquid crystal display comprising a half-acrylated diepoxy resin 

having a bisphenol A backbone, a UV curing agent and an epoxy latent 
hardener.
