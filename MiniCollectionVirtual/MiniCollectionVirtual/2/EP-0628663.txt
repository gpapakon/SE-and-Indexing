<ABSTRACT>
The machine has single-function driving piles (7), with a drive unit (9) for movement. The unit consists of operating drives (10), which are connected to the piles, and supported in the machine frame (2), or suspended. The counter frame elements (6) are free of the driving piles and connected with their ends to lifting and lowering drives (11). The drives are also fastened to the machine frame, and are controlled for counter frame movement. The counter frame elements are connected at right angles to their longitudinal direction, via expander elements (12).

A machine for the driving in and pulling of 
supporting wall elements (1), e.g. of sheet piles, when 

advancing trenches with the aid of an excavator, having 

a machine frame (2) which comprises two ground frame 
elements (3) disposed along the edge of the trench 

and running in the longitudinal direction of the 
trench, and tie-bars (4) joining the ground frame 

elements (3), and which is designed for guiding the 
supporting wall elements (1), 
a counter-frame (5), which comprises two counter-frame 
elements (6), which are disposed in the cut 

trench, which run in the longitudinal direction of 
the trench, which are raisable and lowerable in the 

trench, and on which the supporting wall elements 
(1) can be supported, 
a driving beam (7) disposed in the machine frame (2) 
at each trench edge side, which driving beams extend 

in the longitudinal direction of the trench and can 
be attached individually or jointly, by attachment 

devices, to the supporting wall elements (1) to be 
driven in or to be pulled, 
 
wherein the driving beams (7) are disposed in the machine 

frame (2) and are raisable and lowerable with the aid of drive 
devices (9), characterised in that the combination of the  

 
following features is put into effect: 


a) the driving beams (7) are single-function driving 
beams and possess a drive device (9) for the travel 

of the driving beams, which drive device comprises 
adjusting drives (10), which are disposed in the 

region of the ends of the driving beams (7), which 
are attached on one side to the driving beams (7) and 

are supported or suspended on the other side in the 
machine frame (2), and which are controllable for the 

travel of the driving beams, 
b) the counter-frame elements (6) are free from the 
driving beams (7) and are attached in the region of 

their ends to raising and lowering drives (11) and 
are guided by the latter, which raising and lowering 

drives (11) are fixed on the other side to the 
machine frame (2) and are controllable for the travel 

of the counter-frame, 
 
wherein the counter-frame elements (6) are joined transversely 

to their longitudinal direction via stretcher elements (12). 
A machine according to claim 1, wherein the 
adjusting drives (10) of the driving beams are constructed as 

cylinder-and-piston arrangements. 
A machine according to either one of claims 1 or 
2, wherein the raising and lowering drives (11) of the 

counter-frame elements (6) are constructed as cylinder-and-piston  
 

arrangements. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the raising and lowering drives (11) of the counter-frame 

elements (6) in turn are guided, with the aid of 
auxiliary guide elements (13), on supporting wall elements (1) 

which have already been driven in. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the raising and lowering drives (11) of the counter-frame 

elements (6) in turn are guided, with the aid of 
auxiliary guide elements, on supports which have been 

additionally driven in. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the adjusting drives (10) of the driving beams (7) on 

the one hand and the raising and lowering drives (11) of the 
counter-frame elements (7) on the other hand are constructed 

as constructionally autonomous and operationally independent 
drives. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the adjusting drives (10) of the driving beams (7) and 

the raising and lowering drives (11) are constructed as 
constructionally unitary, operationally differentiated drives, 

which can be controlled differently for the so-called driving 
beam travel on the one hand and for the counter-frame travel 

on the other hand. 
A machine according to claim 7, wherein the 
adjusting drives (10) of the driving beams (7) and the raising  

 
and lowering drives (11) are constructed as double cylinder-and-piston 

arrangements (14), each with two piston rods (15), 
one of which is attached to the associated driving beam (7) 

and the other of which is attached to the associated counter-frame 
element (6). 
A machine according to either one of claims 7 or 
8, wherein the driving beams (7) can be guided conjointly and 

inoperatively during the travel of the counter-frame. 
A machine according to either one of claims 7 or 
8, wherein the counter-frame elements (6) can be uncoupled 

from the drives during the travel of the driving beams. 
A machine according to claim 1, wherein the 
counter-frame elements (6) are attached in the region of their 

ends to vertical counter-frame sections (17), which in turn 
are guided in the machine frame (2), and wherein the raising 

and lowering drives (11) are disposed between the machine 
frame (2) and the counter-frame sections (17). 
A machine according to claim 11, wherein the 
machine frame (2) comprises the ground frame elements (3) and 

guide tie-bars (19) for the counter-frame sections (17), which 
guide tie-bars are attached to the ground frame elements via 

supports (18), and wherein the raising and lowering drives
