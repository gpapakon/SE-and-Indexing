<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for displaying prices electronically on shelves (1). To improve the operating safety, and to reduce the radiated field strengths, it is proposed that the transmitting elements (6) near the display units (4) are moved to the edges of the shelves (1), that the components (13) of the display units (4) receive the energy which is radiated by the transmitting elements (6) inductively, and that the control transmitter (3) applies an alternating current to the transmitting elements (6) in the pauses (26) between the data packets (25), and charges the current sources (15) of the display units (4).

An installation for electronic price display on
shelves (1), comprising a computer (2), a driver (3)

connected thereto, and electronic display units (4)
fixed to the edges of the shelves (1), wherein


at least the shelves (1) equipped with display
units (4) are provided with electrically conductive

transmission elements (6) which are fed with an
alternating current by the driver (3) and radiate

electromagnetic energy,
the driver (3) transmits through the transmission
elements (6) data packets (25) which contain the data

for display and which are separated chronologically by
intervals (26), and
each display unit (4) contains a component (13) to
receive the energy radiated by the transmission

elements (6), said component (13) feeding a charging
current to a chargeable current source (15), which

supplies at least part of the operating current for the
display unit (4),
characterised in that
 the transmission elements (6) are
disposed at the edges of the shelves (1) near the

display units (4),

in that the components (13) of the display units (4)
inductively receive the energy radiated by the

transmission elements (6) and
in that the driver (3) feeds an alternating current to
the transmission elements (6) in the intervals (26)

between the data packets (25) and charges up the
current sources (15) of the display units (4).
An installation according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the display units (4) receive the
data packets (25) inductively.
An installation according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the current source (15) is a
capacitor and/or a rechargeable battery.
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 3, 
characterised in that
 the current sources (15)
for the display units (4) are also charged during the

transmission of the data packets (25).
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 4, 
characterised in that
 the display units (4)
switch over by means of the induced voltages between

the charging phase in which charging of the current
source (15) takes place and the transmission phase of a

data packet (25).
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 5, 
characterised in that
 the alternating current in
the intervals (26) between the data packets (25) is of

constant frequency and/or amplitude.
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 6, 
characterised in that
 the driver (3) modulates
the data packets (25) on to an alternating current of

constant frequency and amplitude by amplitude and/or
frequency modulation and/or superimposes them thereon.
An installation according to claim 7,

characterised in that
 the frequency and/or amplitude of
the alternating current during the transmission of the 

data packets (25) differs from the frequency and/or
amplitude in the intervals (26).
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 8, 
characterised in that
 after receiving a data
packet (25) the display units (4) in turn emit a data

packet which is transmitted inductively to the
neighbouring transmission element (6) and from the

latter via the driver (3) to the computer (2).
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 9, 
characterised in that
 the display units (4) have
a component (13) serving both for energy transmission

and for data transmission.
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 9, 
characterised in that
 the display units (4) are
equipped with two separate components (13), one of

which serves for energy transmission and one for data
transmission.
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 11, 
characterised in that
 the component (13) is a
flat coil wound in layers.
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 12,

 the transmission elements
(6) are integrally formed in a profile (8) forming the

edge of the shelf (1).
An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 15, 
characterised in that
 at least the parts of the
transmission elements (6) neighbouring the display

units (4) are laid in loop form.
An installation according to any one of claims 1

An installation according to any one of claims 1
to 16,
