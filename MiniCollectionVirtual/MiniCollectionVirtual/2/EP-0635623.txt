<ABSTRACT>
A rotor of a turbo machine, in particular of a turbine of a gas turbine engine, is specified in which the blades are anchored by means of multi-toothed profiling of the blade roots in correspondingly shaped axial grooves of the wheel rim and supported one against another over the circumference in a manner suppressing vibration. The aim in this case is to fit the rotor alternately with blades of lesser or greater mass resulting from different densities of the blade material.

A rotor of a turbo-engine, in particular a turbine of a gas-turbine engine, in which the 
rotor blades (2, 3) are anchored by a serrated profiling of the blade bases (2', 3') in 

appropriately shaped axial grooves in the rotor rim (6) and are supported against one 
another over the periphery in a vibration-damping manner, 
characterized in that
 the 
rotor (1) is provided alternately with rotor blades (2, 3) of smaller and greater mass, 

resulting from differing densities of the blade material, and the blade bases (2'), the base 
profiles and the axial grooves (4) in the rotor blades (2) of smaller mass are adapted to 

the reduced centrifugal stresses as compared with those of the rotor blades (3) of 
greater mass. 
A rotor according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the same radial base lengths and 
groove depths are provided respectively for all the rotor blades (2; 3) each having a 

base profile in the shape of a fir tree. 
A rotor according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the bases (2'; 3') of the rotor 
blades (2;. 3) of smaller and greater mass are provided with profile tapers (
V
; 
V
') uniformly 
changing in a continuous manner on the periphery between two disc humps (12) 

and adapted to the differing degrees of tensile and bending stresses depending upon the 
mass of the rotor blades (2,3 ). 
A rotor according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the bases (2'; 3') of the rotor 
blades (2; 3) of smaller and greater mass are provided with profile tapers (
V
; 
V
') substantially 
uniform in a continuous manner on the periphery between two disc humps 

(12), 

all the axial grooves (4; 5) at the lower end pass into comparatively large - relative 
to the respectively remaining profile contour - dovetail-shaped cross-sections, 
the same relatively central peripheral distances (
A
, 
A
') of the blade bases (2'; 3') and 
the axial grooves (4; 5) are provided, and 
the disc humps (12) are arranged at mutually different, relatively central peripheral 
distances (
a2
, 
a3
). 
A rotor according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the rotor 
blades of greater mass consist of a high-alloy heat-resistant metallic material.  

 
A rotor according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
consist of heat-resistant intermetallic compound, in particular a nickel or titanium aluminide 

and alloys thereof. 
A rotor according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the rotor 
blades of smaller mass are produced from a temperature-resistant lightweight material 

with a globular cell structure. 
A rotor according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
are produced from a ceramic material. 
A rotor according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
are produced from a ceramic material reinforced with ceramic fibres. 
A rotor according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
are produced from silicon carbide reinforced with silicon carbide fibres. 
A rotor according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
are produced from silicon carbide which is self-sintering or hot-pressed. 
A rotor according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the rotor blades of smaller mass 
are produced from silicon nitride which is reaction-sintered or self-sintering or hot-pressed. 
A rotor according to one or more of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 all the rotor 
blades (2; 3) can be supported against one another in a central peripheral area and/or in 

the peripheral area towards the heads of the blades in a torsion-preventing and vibration-damping 
manner at a pre-determined operating point, wherein each rotor blade is 

provided on both sides with members which project in the peripheral direction and on 
the adjacent borders of which the rotor blades can be supported against one another in 

the peripheral and axial directions.
