<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printer with a univeral interface, with a processor (1) which can be connected to a storage medium (26, 27) and to data input and data output connections (28) for external devices. In order to widen the capabilities of use and to increase the printing speed, it is proposed to use a common interface (20) which is driven by the processor (1) and to which both the storage medium (26, 27) and the data input and data output connections (28) for external devices can be connected.

A printer comprising:

a processor (1) and a universal interface (20) that
is controlled by the processor (1) and has connected to

it a data input connection (28) and a data output connection
(28) for external devices,
wherein the interface (20) includes a first read
signal line (7) for the data input connection (28) for

the external devices and a first write signal line (6)
for the data output connection (28) for the external

devices,
and wherein the interface (20) includes a second read
signal line (9) and a second write signal line (8) for a

storage medium (26, 27).
The printer according to claim 1, characterized
in that the processor (1) can switch over from one width

of a data bus (18, 19) of the interface (20) to another.
The printer according to claim 1, characterized
by a multiplexer (4) which controls the write signal and

read signal lines (6 - 9) of the interface (20) by referring
to a read signal line (2), a write signal line (3),

and the address bus (11) of the processor (1).
The printer according to claim 3, characterized
by an address decoder (21) which controls the multiplexer

(4) by referring to the address bus (11) of the processor
(1).
The printer according to any one of the claims
1 to 4, characterized by a baud rate generator (23) which

serves as a clock generator of the interface (20), the
processor (1) having a clock generator (5) of its own. 
The printer according to any one of the claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the processor (1) controls

a printing mechanism (25).
The printer according to any one of the claims
1 to 6, characterized in that it is a thermal printer

which is capable of printing onto label strips.
The printer according to any one of the claims
1 to 7, characterized in that the processor (1) is an

RISC processor.
The printer according to any one of the claims
1 to 8, characterized in that a storage medium (26, 27)

is connected to the second read signal line (9) and to
the second write signal line (8).
