<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a permanent-magnet-energised miniature motor which ensures a longer life even in confined installation spaces. This is achieved in that the cylindrical motor housing consists of a short first housing part (25), which encloses the part of the rotor shaft (13) with the commutator (23) and the brush bridge (21) and covers a longer, cylindrical second housing part (7) whose diameter is much smaller than that of the first housing part (25) and which covers the part of the rotor shaft (13) with the laminated rotor core (17), including the winding overhangs (27) of the rotor winding (15).
