<ABSTRACT>
A key plate examination apparatus and examination method 
whereby the form of an examined key plate can be recognized 

accurately and form information of a reference key plate can 
be compared with the recognized key plate form to determine 

their conformity rapidly. The form of the examined key plate 
is recognized by form recognition means, and form information 

is generated by form information generation means in response 
to the recognized form of the examined key plate. On the 

other hand, form information of the key number corresponding 
to a key number input externally is retrieved by key number 

retrieval means from a key information memory means storing 
the key number proper to the reference key plate and its 

corresponding form information. The form information 
generated by the form information generation means is 

compared with the form information retrieved by the key 
number retrieval means to determine their conformity by 

determination means. The operator is informed of the 
determination result of the determination means by 

communication means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a key plate examination
apparatus according to the preambles of claim 1 or 2 and a key
plate examination method according to the preambles of claim 5
or 6
and in particular to an apparatus and
method for examining key plates by comparing the form of a
key plate being examined with the form of a reference key
plate and the specification values for determination.Hitherto, for the form of a key plate such as an
ignition key of a car, the undulation dimensions of
mountain-and-valley-like irregularities of the key plate and
their combination have been represented as a key code
consisting of a plurality of digits, and car manufacturers
have prepared and managed the key plates for each car based
on the key codes. On the other hand, key manufacturers and
car manufacturers need to display key codes indicating form
information of key plates on the key plates for preparing
spare keys, etc., and prevent outsiders from easily
reproducing the key plates. Therefore, in fact, the key
numbers (symbols corresponding to the key codes on a 
one-to-one basis) prepared based on the key code collation
tables owned by the key manufactures and the car
manufacturers are represented on the key plates.To examine whether or not each key plate thus prepared
and managed has a combination of irregularities as its key
code and whether or not the irregular form is machined within
the tolerance of the form specification values, for example,
the dimensions of the key plate are directly measured with
measuring instruments such as slide calipers and micrometers
or the key plate is projected by a projector and the key
plate dimensions are calculated, and the measured dimensions
are then collated with the dimensions on a work drawing and
form information of the key code retrieved according to the
key number displayed on the key plate in order to examine the
key plate form. For example, disclosed in
JP-A-58-19832 is a key code display device
which brings a plurality of styli into contact with the
irregularities of a key plate, calculates a key code in
response to the displacement amount of the styli, and
displays the key code.Thus, the key plate dimensions and key code detected in
contact or non-contact with a key plate are collated with an
enormous amount of key information of reference key plates
listed in collation tables.However, the conventional key plate form examination
requires comparison or collation of form information such as 
the dimensions and combination of irregularities of the key
plate measured
