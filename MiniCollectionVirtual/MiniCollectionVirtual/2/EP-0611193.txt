<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring forces exerted on a mechanical part and a method of fastening this device. This device comprises at least one small plate (2) and a strain gauge (3), the gauge (3) being fixed onto the small plate (2) which is connected to the mechanical part (1) by linkage and coupling means (4, 5), the strain gauge (3) generating an electrical signal which is representative of the forces exerted. Application: measurement of forces exerted on any type of mechanical parts, especially on braking callipers.

Device for measuring the stresses exerted on a
component (1), comprising at least one small plate (2)

and a strain gauge (3), the gauge (3) being attached to
the small plate (2), which is connected to the component

(1) by connection and coupling means (5, 6, 8), the
strain gauge (3) generating an electrical signal representative

of the stresses exerted, characterized in that
since the component (1) is a mechanical component, the

small plate (2) is attached to the mechanical component
(1) with a fitting prestress so that the lower parts make

a predetermined angle (α, α') with respect to the sides
(68, 69) of the small plate.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that at least two connection points connect the small

plate (2) to the mechanical component (1).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that means (4) for shaping the

electrical signal are implanted on the small plate (2).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the shaping means (4) deliver a frequency signal.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a thermistor is coupled to

the strain gauge in order to compensate for temperature
drift of the signal generated.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the coupling means consist

of adhesive (5").
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the coupling means consist of

solder. 
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is covered with a

protective coating (7).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the small plate (2) consists

of a strip made of flexible material folded along
four lines (61, 62, 63, 64) in order to form an upper

part (65) connected by sides (68, 69) to two lower parts
(66, 67) which are attached to the mechanical component

(1).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that as the mechanical component

(1) has undergone a tensile or compressive strain, strain
gauges (3) fixed to the small plate (2) measure at least

one surface strain from among the following four, upper
longitudinal surface strain (ε
1
), lower longitudinal
surface strain (ε
2
), upper transverse surface strain (ε
3
)
and lower transverse surface strain (ε
4
), these surface
strains being induced by the strain undergone by the

mechanical component (1).
Method of attaching the device according to any
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that it

comprises three steps:

a first step (51) in which the connection means
are put into position on the mechanical component (1);
a second step (52) in which the small plate (2)
is put into position on the connection means;
a third step (53) in which the coupling means
are put into position, the small plate (2) and the

coupling means being finally secured by putting the
coupling means into position.
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the coupling means consist of an adhesive packaged

in at least one ampoule before the adhesive is put into
position, the ampoule being attached to that face of the

small plate (2) which is turned towards the mechanical
component (1) and being pierced when the small plate (2)

is put into position on the connection means.
