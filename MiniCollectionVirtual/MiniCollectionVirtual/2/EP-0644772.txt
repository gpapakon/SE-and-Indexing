<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to short peptides.
More particularly, it relates to short peptides capable
of selectively binding to receptors on cells.Since the discovery of endogenous opioid peptides
in the 1970's, extensive research in opioid chemistry and
biology have suggested the existence of multiple opioid
receptors: µ (mu), δ (delta) and κ (kappa).The identification of multiple receptors is
particularly interesting in that many opioids exert a
variety of effects including analgesia, addiction,
respiratory depression, inhibition of gut transit, and
cardiotoxicity. See e.g., The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics, McMillan, pp. 496-536, New York (1980);
Hruby et al., Med. Res. Rev.9:343 (1989); and
Zimmermann, et al., J. Med. Chem.33:895 (1990).Recent work has suggested that opioid peptides may
also be involved in pathological states, including
cancer. As shown in Table 1, multiple opioid receptors
are present on numerous tumor cell lines.While the exact role played by opioid peptides in
oncogenic events remains unknown, opioids have been found
to alter cell function and growth [Slotkin et al. Life
Sci.26:861 (1980); and Wilson et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp.
Ther.199:368 (1976)], to inhibit the growth of cultured
neuroblastoma cells [Zagon et al. Brain Res. Bull.7:25
(1981)], and to inhibit neuroblastoma tumor growth and
prolong survival times, in an opioid antagonist sensitive
manner, in mice with transplanted neuroblastomas, B-16
melanoma, MCF-7 breast cancer, human lung cancer cells 
and others [Zagon et al. Life Sci.28:1095 (1981); Zagon
et al. Science221:671 (1983); and Von Hoff et al. Proc.,
Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., Abstract 932, p. 236 (1982);

The related compounds are growth hormone release promoters,
morphine agonists, dermorphin analogs, analgesics and
enkephalin analogs, respectively.AHPPA = (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentanoic acid
