<ABSTRACT>
A focus balance automatic adjusting device 
includes an adder (20), envelop detector circuit (34), 

disturbance generator (32) and signal processing section 
(36). The adder (20) adds together signals obtained by 

converting signal currents detected by a four-divided 
detector (11) into voltages by use of first and second 

current-voltage converters (31-1, 31-2) to create an RF 
signal. The envelop detector circuit (34) effects the 

peak detection and bottom detection for the RF signal 
and creates an RFRP signal which is a difference between 

the peak detection signal and the bottom detection 
signal. The disturbance generator (32) generates disturbance 

signals for deviating the focus position in 
positive and negative directions. The signal processing 

section (36) receives the RFRP signal and disturbance 
signal to control the gain of the second current-voltage 

converter (31-2). The focus balance is automatically 
adjusted by introducing a disturbance signal output from 

the disturbance generator (32) into a focus servo loop, 
de-focusing the focus position in two opposite directions 

by a preset amount, and setting levels of the RFRP 
signal having amplitude information obtained at this 

time equal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk reproducing device
such as a CD (compact disk) player for optically reading
information stored on a disk, and more particularly to
a focus balance automatic adjusting device and automatic
adjusting method for adjusting the focus balance by controlling
a focus servo.In order to effect the recording/reproducing operation
with high density and high fidelity, a digital
storage/reproduction system for converting an audio
signal into a digital signal by the PCM (Pulse Code
Modulation) technique, storing the signal on a recording
medium such as a disk or magnetic tape and reproducing
the signal is used. Particularly, a CD player for
creating a bit (or pit) string corresponding to digital
data on a disk with a diameter of 12 cm and optically
reading the bit string is now most widely used. With
such a disk reproduction device, recorded data is read
by moving an optical pickup unit having a semiconductor
laser, photoelectric converting element or the like disposed
therein in a direction from the inner periphery to
the outer periphery of the disk by the linear tracking
and rotating the disk with the constant linear velocity
(CLV). When a semiconductor laser is used as the pickup
element, a laser beam is applied from the pickup element
to the track on the disk to detect the presence or
absence of a pit based on the intensity of the reflected 
light and recorded digital data is reproduced based on
the result of detection.In order to always create the smallest spot by the
laser beam on the track of the disk on which data is
recorded, it is necessary for the pickup element to
follow the fluctuation of the focus position caused by a
variation in the thickness of the disk, the warping
thereof and the like. As the error detection method of
the focus servo to serve the above purpose, a large
number of methods such as an astigmatism method, knife-edge
method, wedge prism method and critical angle
method are known. Among the above methods, the astigmatism
method is most often used. In the astigmatism
method, a plane-parallel plate or cylindrical lens is
disposed in a return path of the laser beam or focusing
light path of the reflected beam to intentionally cause
a large astigmatism, detect an elliptical beam form
before and after the circle of least confusion (circular
beam form) and derive a focus error signal. If a detector
is disposed in the position of the circle of least
confusion with the disk set in the focused position, the
light amount distribution on the detector is changed
into
