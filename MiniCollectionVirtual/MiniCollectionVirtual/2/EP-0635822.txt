<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head,includes a magnetoresistive element (1) having 
magnetoresistance effect, the magnetoresistive element being 

exposed to a recording medium facing surface (a), and upper and lower 
shield magnetic bodies (3,2) formed of soft magnetic layers, the upper 

and lower shield magnetic bodies magnetically shielding the 
magnetoresistive element with a non-magnetic layer held between 

them in a direction of film thickness, one or both of the upper 
and lower shield magnetic bodies having at least width (D1) of a 

portion thereof exposed to the recording medium facing surface, 
not smaller than an effective track width and not greater than 

four times a track pitch (P). In this case, in one or both of the 
upper and lower shield magnetic bodies, length in the direction 

of depth determined by the width may be greater than formation 
length of the magnetoresistive element. In one or both of the 

upper and lower shield magnetic bodies, the width is not smaller 

than the effective track width and not greater than the track 
pitch, and the length in the direction of depth determined by the 

width is not smaller than 9% of maximum recording wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetoresistive thin-film 
magnetic head employing a magnetoresistive film having its 
resistivity varied in response to the recording magnetic field 
of a magnetic recording medium and detecting a change in 
resistance of the magnetoresistive film as a reproduction output 
voltage. As the hard disk drive unit has recently become increasingly 
smaller in size and greater in capacity, a 2.5-inch hard disk 
drive unit, for example, is largely demanded for application to 
portable computers represented by personal computers of notebook 
type. In such a small-size hard disk drive unit, the medium 
velocity is reduced depending upon the diameter of the disk. 
Therefore, With a conventional inductive magnetic head having 
medium-velocity-dependent reproduction output, the reproduction 
output is lowered, disturbing enlargement of capacity. However, a magnetoresistance effect magnetic head which 
detects, as a reproduction output voltage, a change in resistance 
of a magnetoresistive element having its resistivity varied in 
accordance with the magnetic field does not have the medium-velocity-dependent 
reproduction output, thus allowing a high 
reproduction output to be produced even at a low medium velocity.  
 
For this reason, the magnetoresistance effect magnetic head is 
noted as a magnetic head for realizing a greater capacity with 
the small-size hard disk. The magnetoresistive element is 
hereinafter referred to simply as an MR head. Conventionally, in order to realize the MR head as a 
magnetic head for the hard disk drive unit, a magnetoresistive 
thin-film magnetic head in which a thin-film MR element is 
sandwiched by a lower shield core and an upper shield core as 
magnetic paths in reproduction is formed on a slider member. The 
magnetoresistive thin-film magnetic head is hereinafter referred 
to simply as an MR thin-film head. In further detail, a vertical MR thin-film head, for 
example, includes a non-magnetic substrate 101, an insulation 
layer 102, a soft magnetic film as a lower shield magnetic body 
103 and an insulation layer 104 are stacked in this order from 
the bottom, as shown in Figs.1 and 2. On the insulation layer 
104, an MR element 105 is arranged with its longitudinal 
direction perpendicular to a magnetic recording facing surface 
(head surface a) and with its one end surface exposed to the head 
surface a. In addition, a front-end electrode 106a and a rear-end 
electrode 106b for supplying sense currents to both ends of 
the MR element 105 are
