<ABSTRACT>
A mobile metal building forming machine (30, 34, 38, 40, 68, 74) forms a panel (P) of predetermined length from a coil of flat metal and then the formed panels are continuously crimped on their side edges (Cs) for strength and are selectively curved by crimping the bottom (Cb) of the panel. The crimping and curvature are automatically controlled so that building panels with vertical walls and an arched roof may be formed. A moveable crimping roll (70, 72) is automatically portioned to control the curvature and the roll is chain driven (94, 98, 102) so that it may be moved without affecting its rotational drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in machines
and methods for constructing metal building and
building configurations, and more particularly relates
to arched roof, vertical wall, self supporting metal
buildings formed of adjacent seamed together panels and
a method and machine for forming such panels.An apparatus according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1 is known from US-A-4 505 084. This document also discloses a method according to the preamble of claim 11.It is known in the prior art to make metal
buildings from adjacent formed metal building panels
which are arched or curved, assembled side-by-side and
seamed together. See for example, US-A-3,902,288
(1975) for showing of such building in which
the roof panels are completely curved or arched and
extend to the foundation. In such buildings the roof
panels continue as the side walls of the building and
the basic building construction is in the shape of a
continuous arch or semi-circle when viewed from the
end. A machine for making the metal panels for such
building in which the formed panels are corrugated not
only on the side edges of the box, but also on the
bottom to create the curvature, is shown in US-A-3,842,647 
(1974). A method of building the
building by adjacent panels which are seamed together
is disclosed in US-A-3,967,430 (1976). A
seamer for forming the seams between the adjacent
panels of the prior Knudson patents is shown in
US-A-3,875,642 (1975). The prior art represented by
the Knudson patents is owned and has been
commercialized by M.I.C. Industries, Inc. of Reston,
Virginia in its mobile K-SpanÂ® machines.An arched building construction i.e., construction
of which walls and roof are completely arched has
advantages, but also a number of limitations. One
limitation is the absence of vertical walls which
limits the use of vertical space. Often users of metal
buildings want vertical walls both for aesthetic
purposes and to allow more use of space near the edges
of the buildings. Additionally, known prior art
machines had a limitation on the thickness of steel
used in forming the metal panels, because of machine
limitations. The basic size and strength of such metal
buildings is also limited by local wind and live load
limitations as established by building codes throughout
the nation and the world. As these building code
standards become more conservative, a builder is
effectively limited to only certain size buildings.
The complete arched building must be limited in size in
order to prevent overloading such as could

<CLAIMS>
A machine for automatically and controllably
forming sheet metal into panels for metal buildings

having combined walls and roof panels, at least a
portion of which are arched or curved; the machine

comprising:

a) roll forming means (38) for roll forming sheet
metal material (36) into a desired panel profile having a

central bottom portion between upturned lateral edge
portions;
b) crimping mean (70,72) for continuously crimping by
bending small folds in the bottom portion of formed

sheared panel lengths fed through the crimping means (70,72) to
provide a curvature of the formed panels, the depth of

the folds establishing the curvature; 
characterised by
c) shear means (40) adjacent the roll forming means
for shearing the roll formed panel;
d) panel curvature measuring means (74) for measuring
the curvature of bottom crimped formed panels, and;
e) automatic digital control means for
controlling the crimping means (70, 72) to vary and control the

extent of curvature of the formed panels by varying the
depth of the folds the automatic digital control means

being at least partially responsive to the measuring
means and a control input setting of desired curvature.
A machine as defined in claim 1 further
comprising; means for automatically and controllably

adjusting the crimping means only so that the sheared
panel bottom portion is not crimped and a corresponding

portion of the formed panel is straight. 
A machine as defined in claim 2 further
comprising; additional crimping means (76) for crimping the

edge portions of the formed panels, and length
measuring means connected to control means for

continuously and automatically measuring the length of
formed panels passing through the crimping means.
A machine as defined in claim 1 wherein the
crimping means includes a pair of crimping rolls (70,72)
