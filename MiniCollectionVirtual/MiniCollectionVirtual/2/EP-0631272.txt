<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic transducer which can produce an 
ultrasonic image having a high resolution and a high 

detection depth, comprising a piezoelectric element (1) 
having a concave surface on a side where ultrasonic waves 

are transmitted or received, and first and second 
acoustic matching layers (3,4) formed on the concave surface of 

the piezoelectric element, the first acoustic matching 
layer (3) being laid on a side near to the piezoelectric 

element and having an ununiform thickness with a maximum 
thickness of about quarter wavelength, and the second 

acoustic matching layer (4) being laid on the side near to an 
object to be detected and having an uniform thickness of 

about quarter wavelength. Thereby, the ultrasonic 
transducer including the acoustic matching layers having 

the maximum thickness set to about quarter wave length 
and the piezoelectric element exhibit a normal 

distribution type frequency characteristic over a wide 
range, and can allow the piezoelectric element has an 

arbitrary curvature so that an ultrasonic wave can be 
converged at a position having an arbitrary distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
transducer which is used in a ultrasonic diagnosing
apparatus, for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic
waves.Heretofore, studies for allowing an ultrasonic
transducer to have its frequency characteristic over a
wide range, and to have a structure using an acoustic
lens have been made. For example, a structure disclosed
in Handbook of Medical Ultrasonic Equipments, page 186.
"5.3.1 Basic Structure of Ultrasonic Probe", has been
well-known.Fig. 5 shows a conventional ultrasonic
transducer of this kind, which comprises a piezoelectric
element 11 having a uniform thickness, at least two of
ultrasonic matching layers 12, 13 provided on the
ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving side (front
surface side) of the piezoelectric element 11 and having
a uniform quarter wave length thickness, for relaxing
reflection caused by mismatching in acoustic impedance
between the piezoelectric element and an object to be
detected, so as to effectively radiate ultrasonic waves,
a backing member 14 provided at the rear surface of the
piezoelectric element 11 so as to have damping and 
holding functions, and an acoustic lens 15 provided at the front surface of the
acoustic matching layer 13 and made of silicone rubber materials for converging
an ultrasonic beam.The above-mentioned arrangement can have a frequency characteristic
having a wide band, and further, can materialize a high resolution since the
ultrasonic wave is converged thinly.US-A-4659956 describes an ultrasonic transducer which has a piezoelectric
element with a concave surface against which is located an acoustic matching layer
of non-uniform thickness. The matching layer has its minimum thickness at its
centre.EP-A-005857 describes an ultrasonic transducer which has a piezoelectric
element with a concave surface against which is located an acoustic matching layer
of non-uniform thickness, the maximum thickness of the matching layer being at
its centre.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an
ultrasonic transducer comprising a piezoelectric element having a substantially
uniform thickness and having a concave surface on a side where ultrasonic waves
are transmitted and received, and at least one acoustic matching layer (3) laid on
the concave surface side of said piezoelectric element, characterised in that said
matching layer has a non-uniform thickness such that its maximum thickness is at
its centre and wherein said maximum thickness is one quarter wave length at 5.0
MHZ. In one
