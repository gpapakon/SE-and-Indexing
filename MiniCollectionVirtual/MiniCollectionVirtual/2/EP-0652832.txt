<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer printing receiver sheet for use in security laminates, comprises a substrate having a dye-receiving surface on one side and a back coat on the other, characterised in that the substrate comprises a plastics material film having on at least one side thereof a layer which has a lower melting point than the plastics material film and a strength of adhesion to the plastics material film greater than the strength of the plastics material film itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to receiver sheets for dye-diffusion 
thermal transfer printing, and in particular to receiver sheets 
for use in security laminates in which the receiver sheet after 
printing is laminated to protective cover sheets on both its 
printed side and its reverse side. The invention also relates to 
security laminates comprising such printed receiver sheets. Security laminates are presently based on various types of 
information-carrying sheets laminated to cover sheets. These 
typically have at least one side carrying pictorial information 
in the form of a normal optical photograph, including typed 
script and/or signatures as appropriate. This is bonded to a 
cover sheet on each side. These cover sheets normally overlap to 
bond to each other and form a pouch, at least during manufacture, 
but in the final product the information carrying sheet may have 
raw unprotected edges, eg when cards or tags are stamped or cut 
out of a larger area. An alternative to optical photography as a means of 
producing pictorial representations of persons, signatures, 
graphics and other such form of information, is thermal transfer 
printing. However, while this technology can provide some 
advantages, particularly in its versatility, it can also produce 
difficulties in lamination. Thermal tranfer printing is a generic term for processes in 
which one or more thermally transferable dyes are caused to 
transfer from a dyesheet to a receiver in response to thermal 
stimuli. Using a dyesheet comprising a thin substrate supporting 
a dyecoat containing one or more such dyes uniformly spread over 
an entire printing area of the dyesheet, printing can be effected 
by heating selected discrete areas of the dyesheet while the 
dyecoat is pressed against a receiver sheet, thereby causing dye 
to transfer to corresponding areas of that receiver. The shape 
of the pattern transferred is determined by the number and 
locating of the discrete areas which are subjected to heating. 
Full colour prints can be produced by printing with different 
coloured dyecoats sequentially in like manner, and the different  
 
coloured dyecoats are usually provided as discrete uniform 
print-size areas in a repeated sequence along the same dyesheet. High resolution photograph-like prints can be produced by 
dye-diffusion thermal transfer printing using appropriate 
printing equipment, such as a programmable thermal print head or 
laser printer, controlled by electronic signals derived from 
video, computer, electronic still

A thermal transfer printing receiver sheet for use in security 
laminates comprising a substrate having a dye receiving coat on 

one side and a back coat on the other side, characterised in that 
the substrate comprises a film of biaxially drawn crystalline 

polyethylene terephthalate having, on at least the side carrying 
the dye receiving coat, a layer of amorphous polyethylene 

terephthalate co-extruded with the film which layer has a lower 
melting point than the film and a strength of adhesion to 

the film greater than the tear strength of the film itself. 
A security laminate comprising 

a) printed thermal transfer receiver sheet comprising a 
substrate supporting on one side a receiver layer comprising a 

thermoplastic dye receptive polymer into at least part of which 
has been diffused a print of one or more thermal transfer dyes, 

and on the other side a back coat 
b) a cover sheet of plastics material bonded to the printed 
receiver layer, and 
c) a cover sheet of plastics material bonded to the back coat, 
characterised in that the substrate comprises a film of biaxially 

drawn crystalline polyethylene terephthalate having, on at least 
the side carrying the dye receiving coat, a layer of amorphous 

polyethylene terephthalate co-extruded with the film, which layer 
has a lower melting point than the film and a strength of 

adhesion to the film greater than the tear strength of the film 
itself.
