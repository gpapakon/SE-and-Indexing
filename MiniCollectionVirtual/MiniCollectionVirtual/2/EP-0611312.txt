<ABSTRACT>
A coupling assembly, in particular for a cryogen supply line for cryosurgical apparatus, comprises a male coupling member (14) and a female coupling member (12). Sealing means for the assembly comprises a first rubber O ring (24) located internally on the female member and a second rubber O ring (30) located externally of the male member. When the male member is inserted into the female member the first and second coupling members define a closed chamber (32). Any cryogen leakage operates within the chamber thereby increasing the pressure therewithin and tending to prevent further leakage. The coupling members are secured together by means of corresponding screw threaded portions (41, 44).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Improvements in or Relating to Coupling AssembliesThis invention relates to coupling assemblies. In particular, the invention relates to coupling assemblies for cryogen supply lines such as are associated with cryosurgical apparatus-Known coupling assemblies for supply lines of cryogens, for example liquid nitrogen, comprise two parts which can be fastened together. The problem with such existing coupling assemblies is that there is leakage of the cryogen from the assembly.It is an objection of the invention to obviate and/or mitigate these and other disadvantages.According to this invention, there is provided a coupling assembly for a cryogen supply line, said assembly comprising first and second coupling members each defining a passageway for the cryogen, the first coupling member being adapted to receive the second coupling member such that the respective passageways are in register, and securing means to secure the first coupling member to the second coupling member.Preferably, the coupling assembly comprises seal- 

 ing means to seal the assembly and to prevent leakage therefrom. The sealing means may comprise first and second sealing members which, when the first and second coupling members are secured together, define a closed chamber therebetween. Thus, if any cryogen leaks past the first sealing member, it passes into the chamber where it evaporates thereby increasing the pressure in the chamber to prevent further leakage.Preferably, the first and second coupling members have corresponding parallel portions and tapered portions such that the tapered portion on the first coupling member receives the tapered portion on the second coupling member. The first sealing member may comprise a first rubber ring on the first coupling member and the second sealing member may comprise a second rubber ring on the second coupling member. The first sealing member may be provided on the parallel portion of the first coupling member and the second sealing member may be provided on the tapered portion of the second coupling member.In the preferred embodiment, the first coupling member comprises a female member and the second coupling member comprises a male member, the female and male members being adapted to engage each other matingly. 

 The securing means may comprise a screw threaded member on the second coupling member, which may be rotatable independently of the second coupling member. The securing means may further comprise corresponding screw threads on the first coupling member adapted to engage the
