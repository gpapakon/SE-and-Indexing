<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene in a high yield from a readily available 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane 
industrially at a low cost, which process comprises bringing the gaseous hexafluoropropane into contact with active carbon 

optionally containing a metallic salt to effect dehydrofluorination. A process for producing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane at a 
high conversion and a high selectivity, which comprises reducing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene with hydrogen in the presence of 

either a hydrogenation catalyst comprising palladium and, added thereto, one or more metals selected from among silver, copper, 
gold, tellurium, zinc, chromium, molybdenum and thallium, or a rhodium catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present inventions relate to methods for 
manufacturing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene, which is useful 
as an intermediate for compounds that can be substitutes 
for CFC and HCFC as refrigerants, blowing agents and 
cleaning agents, and as a monomer of macromolecule 
compounds, and methods for manufacturing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane, 
which is a useful compound that can be 
said substitutes for CFC and HCFC for said uses. Among the conventionally known manufacturing methods of 
1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene are: 1) the method of 
1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane (which is produced by 
hydrogenating hexafluoropropene) being reacted with an 
aqueous solution of KOH with a 70% to 80% concentration at 
150°C (Ann. Chim. (Italy) vol. 55, 850p, 1965); and 2) the 
method of 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane being reacted with  
 
KOH in dibutylether (Izvest. Akad. Nauk S.S.S.R., Otdel. 
Khim. Nauk 1412p, 1960). Another known method is: the method 
of removing HF from 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane by means 
of granular KCl in the gaseous phase at 700°C to produce 
the desired product (Ann. Chim. (Italy) vol. 55, 850p, 
1965). Those methods, however, contained in the above-mentioned 
literature are not cost-effective because a 
large amount of alkali is used. As to the gaseous reaction 
process with KCl, it does not suit to the industrial 
production because it produces a 30% large amount of 
1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropene having a boiling point 
approximate to that of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene and 
being difficult to be separate by the ordinary rectification 
methods cannot well separate away. The known manufacturing method of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane 
is the method of hydrogenating 
1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene as a raw material (Izvest. 
Akad. Nauk S.S.S.R. 1960, 1412-18). This method, however, has a low yield because it also 
further hydrogenates the material and produces 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane. 
The method does not suit to the  
 
industrial production because 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane, 
which is azeotropic or pseudo-azeotropic with 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane, 
is difficult to separate. An objective of the present inventions is to provide 
a highly cost-effective industrial method to produce 
1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene at high yields. The other objective of those inventions is to provide 
a method with high reactivities and selectivities to 
produce 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane. The inventors have thoroughly studied cost-effective 
industrial production methods of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene,
