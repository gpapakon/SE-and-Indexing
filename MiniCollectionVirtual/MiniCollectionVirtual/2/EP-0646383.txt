<ABSTRACT>
Device for detecting bubbles in an infusion line, comprising a first tube (14) for conveying a fluid, a bubble trap (18) comprising an inlet orifice connected to the first tube, a container (26) having a chamber which can be filled with fluid, and an outlet orifice, such that, when a bubble penetrates into the chamber via the inlet orifice, an equivalent volume of fluid is displaced from the chamber and leaves the container via the outlet orifice, a second tube (16) connected to the outlet orifice of the container, a bubble detector (22) capable of detecting a bubble of predetermined length in the second tube, and means for generating a signal if such a bubble is detected.
