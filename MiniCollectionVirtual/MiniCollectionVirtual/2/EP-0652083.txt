<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shaving apparatus (1) with a housing (5) and with a shear-head frame (6) fixed on the housing (5), and with a lower cutter (12) and with a foil-like upper cutter (11) which interacts with a cutting region (14) of the lower cutter (12), is retained by a foil-cutter frame (21) mounted pivotably in the shear-head frame (6), and exhibits at least two hole panels (31, 32) which differ as regards the design of the hair-passage holes (33, 34), and with a handle (35) which is provided for adjusting the foil-cutter frame (21) and is coupled to the foil-cutter frame (21) via an adjustment device (36). The handle (35) is retained adjustably on the housing (5) of the shaving apparatus (1), and the adjustment device (36) exhibits an adjustment frame (38) which engages beneath the foil-cutter frame (21), in the region thereof, which is directed away from the foil-like upper cutter (11), and is mounted in the shaving apparatus (1) such that it can be pivoted about a pivot axis (43) which runs parallel to the pivot axis (26) of the foil-cutter frame (21).

A shaving apparatus (1) comprising a housing (5), a shaving-head frame
(6), which is detachably mounted on the housing (5), a lower cutter (12), arranged

substantially inside the shaving-head frame (6) and having a cutting area (14) which is
curved relative to an axis of curvature, which lower cutter is reciprocating drivable at

least parallel to the axis of curvature, a foil-cutter frame (21) mounted in the shaving-head
frame (6) so as to be pivotable about a pivotal axis (26) parallel to the axis of

curvature, on which foil-cutter frame a foil-type upper cutter (11) is mounted, which
upper cutter engages with the cutting area of the lower cutter (12), has hair-entry

apertures (33, 34), and at least two aperture fields (31, 32) which differ as regards the
form of the hair-entry apertures (33, 34), and a hand-actuated control member (35) for

actuating the foil-cutter frame (21), which control member is coupled to the foil-cutter
frame (21) via a movable actuating device (36), the foil-cutter frame being pivotable

about its pivotal axis (26) via the actuating device (36) by actuation of said control
member to bring each time one of the aperture fields (31, 32) of the upper cutter (11)

into operative engagement with the cutting area (14) of the lower cutter (12),
characterized in that the control member (35) is movably mounted on the housing (5) of

the shaving apparatus (1) to actuate the foil-type upper cutter (11), and in that the
actuating device (36) comprises an actuating frame (38) which engages underneath the

foil-cutter frame (21) at a location remote from the upper cutter (11), which actuating
frame is mounted in the shaving apparatus (1) so as to be pivotable about a pivotal axis

(43) parallel to the pivotal axis (26) of the foil-cutter frame (21).
A shaving apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
actuating frame (38) is mounted so as to be pivotable about a pivotal axis (43) which

coincides with the pivotal axis (26) of the foil-cutter frame (21).
A shaving apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, in
a plan view of the foil-cutter frame (21) and the actuating frame (38), the actuating

frame (38) is disposed substantially within the foil-cutter frame (21), and in that the
actuating frame (38) has four projections (50-53) which extend away from the actuating 

frame (38) transversely of the pivotal axis of the actuating frame (38) in oppositely
directed pairs, with which projections the actuating frame (38) engages underneath two

frame members of the foil-cutter frame (21), which frame members extend parallel to
the pivotal axis (26) of the foil-cutter frame (21).
A shaving apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that
the control member (35) is formed by a sliding button which is pivotally coupled to an

actuating lever (54) of the actuating device (36), which actuating lever is also pivotally
coupled to the actuating frame (38) of the actuating device (36).
