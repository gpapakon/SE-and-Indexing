<ABSTRACT>
A thermosensitive recording material contains a monosaccharide, oligosaccharide or polysaccharide and a catalyst in one or more binder layers arranged on a transparent support (substrate, carrier) material. On imagewise warming, for example by means of a thermal head, a black/white image of high optical density, good grey level reproduction, high sharpness and good stability is formed in the recording material.

<CLAIMS>
Thermosensitive recording material, consisting of a 
transparent carrier material and one or more layers of 

binding agent arranged thereon, characterised in that 
at least one layer of binding agent contains a 

monosaccharide, oligosaccharide or polysaccharide and 
at least one layer of binding agent, which may be 

identical with the first-named layer of binding agent, 
contains a catalyst. 
Recording material according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the monosaccharide, oligosaccharide or 

polysaccharide and the catalyst are present in various 
layers of binding agent. 
Recording material according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the catalyst is a sulphonic 

acid. 
Recording material according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the layer of binding agen
t in which the 
catalyst is present contains a binding agent having a 

glass transition temperature of 40 to 150°C. 
Recording material according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the layer of binding agent in which the 

catalyst is present, or a layer adjoining it, contains 
a binding agent which decomposes exothermally when 

heated in the presence of the catalyst. 
Recording material according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that a barrier layer is applied between the 

saccharide layer and the catalyst layer.  
 
Recording material according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that it contains a topcoat 

consisting of a polymer having a softening temperature 

>
 100°C.
