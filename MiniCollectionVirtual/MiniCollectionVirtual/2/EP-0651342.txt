<ABSTRACT>
A system for modeling an integrated chip package and 
a method of operation is disclosed that includes a 

parametric processor (1) that provides parameters to 
define the parts of the package to a volume generator 

(2). The volume generator (2) uses the parameters to 
create volumes associated with each part of the 

integrated chip package. The system (3) provides the 
volume coordinates to a mesh generator (4). The mesh 

generator (4) further subdivides the volumes into 
elements, the elements being small enough for use in 

finite element analysis. The output of the mesh 
generator (4) is provided to a finite element analysis 

processor (5). The finite element analysis processor (5) 
conducts a physical stress thermal stress analysis on 

the package using the elements created by the mesh 
generator (4). Once the finite element analysis 

processor (5) has completed its analysis of the package, 
the result is displayed on a display (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of
electronic systems and more particularly to improved
systems and methods for modeling an integrated chip
package. In the field of integrated chip manufacturing, it is
often useful to analyze potential chip package designs
using finite element analysis. Finite element analysis
consists of modeling a chip package and analyzing the
model to determine the effects of physical and thermal
Stress on the package. Three-dimensional modeling is
accomplished by first dividing the package into its
separate parts and identifying from what material each
part is manufactured. Each pare is then divided into
volumes, and the volumes are further subdivided into
elements. Once the package has been meshed as a
collection of small three-dimensional elements, the
elements are used to conduct a finite element analysis of
the package.Two-dimensional modeling of a package is
accomplished by taking a cross-section of the package and
identifying the separate parts of the package in the
cross-section. Each part is then subdivided into areas
and those areas are further subdivided into elamants.
These elements comprise two-dimensional elements in
contrast to the three-dimensional elements used with
three-dimensional modeling. Similar to the
three-dimensional analysis, the two-dimensional elements
are used to conduct a finite element analysis of the
package in two dimensions.A finite element analysis processor takes each
element of a modeled package and analy2es the effect of a
boundary value field equation on it. Both two-dimensional
and three-dimensional finite element analysis
can analyze the effect of both physical and thermal
stresses on the package. The result of a finite element
analysis is to predict what the package will do when the
package is constructed using the modeled structure. The document MACHINE DESIGN, vol. 64, no.8, 23 April 1992,
CLEVELAND US pages 65-69 DVORAK mentions software which provides
mechanical engineers with parametric features to produce models of chip carries
quickly. After building the solid model carrier, engineers may analyze thermal and
structural properties.The document IEEE SPECTRUM, vol.28, no 11, November 1991, US pages
34 - 37 SWANSON 'SIMULATING EM FIELDS' mentions a set of programs to
relieve IC package designers of much of the frustrating and time-consuming chore of
entering package geometries into an EM analysis system. The set works with
AutoCAD drafting software to generate complete three-dimensional models for IC
packages and
