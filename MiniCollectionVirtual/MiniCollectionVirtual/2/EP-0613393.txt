<ABSTRACT>
A putter alignment system (10) includes a putter component (12) mounted on a golf putter (20) and a remote target component (14) situated along the desired alignment axis (18) from the putter (20). Electronic components are utilized to determine relative alignment of the putter (20) to the target by analyzing a reflected slot beam (16). The preferred embodiment includes an emitter (68) on the remote target component (14) and a cylindrical reflector (50) on the putter component (12) to create and delimit the beam (16). The reflector (50) is mounted on the putter (20) so as to be perpendicular to the putter axis (49) such that on perfect alignment the slot beam (16) will coincide with the alignment axis (18). The horizontal position of the slot beam (16) is detected by an array of photosensors (69) while signal output is provided by signal lights (75) corresponding to the relative alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
 .1 PUTTER ALIGNMENT SYSTEM23 TECHNICAL FIELD{ ;• 4"''. 5 The present invention relates generally to6 positioning and alignment apparatus and more particularly to7 devices utilized in order to align a golf putter with a8 desired target for practice purposes. The preferred9 embodiment of the present invention is a system which10 utilizes putter and target portions. The putter portion is11 placed on a golf putter and a corresponding remote component12 representing the target is usually placed in or in the13 vicinity of the golf hole for providing feedback to the user14 when the alignment of the putter is proper. The putter15 alignment system is primarily adapted for use during16 extensive practice to develop muscle memory, and is further17 adapted to be enhanced for use in stroke analysis. 1819 DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART 2021 Golf is certainly one of the most frustrating22 activities ever invented by the human species. The game is23 played by propelling a stationary and uniform ball toward a24 stationary target. This always looks as if it should be very25 easy.26 However, as many million of golfers would readily27 testify, the game is much more difficult than it looks.28 Without even dealing with the vagaries of equipment, causing29 one's own muscles to repetitively perform the same motion is30 a nearly impossible task. Then, when a golfer wishes to make31 minor variations, such as adding additional power or altering ■* 32 the direction slightly in order to impart a desired bend or33 spin, the task becomes even more difficult.' 34 One of the most frustrating areas of golf is putting.35 This activity takes placed on greens of varying degrees of36 difficultly, both as to texture and to topography. However,37 occasionally, the golfer will be faced with a putt on a green38 which appears to have perfectly uniform texture and no slopeSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 or "break" on the putt. Nonetheless, even these absolutely straight and even putts are subject to difficulties. The average golfer is more than fully capable of missing straight and flat putts of any length, even those of three feet and below. Consequently, the pursuit of a straight and even putting stroke is a common activity of golfers of all ages and degrees of skill. Since there is very little more frustrating than missing a straight flat putt, a good deal of time is spent working on this particular aspect of the game. Improving one's putting stroke and particularly, improving the alignment of the putting stroke, is a common subject of golf innovation. A
