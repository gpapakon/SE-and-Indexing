<ABSTRACT>
A terminal is attached to a multi conductor wire by 
crimping of a pair of conductor grips (21,22) around the 

conductors. Mechanical locking of the conductor grips 
maintains a firm grasp of the conductors for improved low 

current and/or low voltage performance. Mechanical locking 
is obtained using grooves (30,31) within the contact areas 

of the conductor grips (21,22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to crimped wire terminals.Crimped terminals are widely used for terminating multi
conductor insulated wires. The terminal comprises a flat metal
blank including pairs of wing projections for gripping an
electrical wire. One pair of projections grips an insulated
portion of the wire and another pair of projections grips a
stripped conductor portion at the end of the wire. The
insulator grips stabilize the terminal and protect the
electrical interconnection between the stripped conductor and
the conductor grips.Nevertheless, in-use conditions experienced by a terminal
(such as flexing of the wire, vibration and thermal shocks, or
jostling of the terminal) cause forces to be transmitted to the
conductor grips. Over time, the conductor grip may weaken and
begin to move.Conductor grip weakening is especially a problem in low
current and low voltage applications where continuous, firm
contact between the wire strands and the conductor grips is
critical. A weakened conductor grip may cause increased
resistance or intermittent contact, which is most likely to
occur at low current or low voltage levels.More specifically, the invention relates to a crimped-type
terminal for crimping around a multi conductor wire oriented
along an axis. The crimped terminal is adapted to be joined
with a mating-terminal of an electrical device or a connecting
wire. The crimped terminal has a terminal body comprising a
metal blank having a substantially flat central blank portion.
An insulator grip extends from one free end of the central
blank portion substantially perpendicularly to the axis for
gripping an insulated portion of the multi conductor wire.
Interconnect means are formed at the other end of the central
blank portion for interconnecting with the mating terminal of
the electrical device. A pair of conductor grips extends from
the central blank portion between the insulator grip and the
interconnect means and substantially perpendicular to the axis. 
The conductor grips each have a top surface for contacting an
uninsulated portion of the multi conductor wire after crimping.
The bottom surfaces of the conductor grips abut at respective
contact areas during crimping.In a terminal of this kind described in GB-A-813 160 the
conductor grip is strengthened by forming one or more ribs on the
bottom surface of the blank and corresponding grooves on the top
surface. After crimping, the grooves engage with the conductor and
the ribs on the two wings of the conductor grip are aligned with
and press

<CLAIMS>
A crimp-type terminal (11) for crimping around a multi
conductor wire (10) oriented along an axis and for joining

with a mating terminal of an electrical device, said
terminal having a terminal body (20) comprising:


a flat blank having a central blank portion (25);
an insulator grip (14) extending from one end of said
central blank portion (25) substantially perpendicularly to

said axis for gripping an insulated portion of said multi
conductor wire;
interconect means (40) formed at the other end of said
central blank portion for interconnecting with said mating

terminal; and
a pair of conductor grips (21, 22) extending from said
central blank portion (25) between said insulator grip (14)

and said interconnect means and substantially
perpendicularly to said axis, said conductor grips each

having a top surface for contacting an uninsulated portion
of said multi conductor wire after crimping, said conductor

grips each having a bottom surface coming into abutment with
the other bottom surface at respective contact areas (23,

24) during crimping,

characterised in that

said conductor grips (21, 22) include interlocking
grooves (30,31) in said contact areas (23, 24) thereof for

engaging one another during crimping to reduce movement of
said conductor grips along said axis after crimping, said

interlocking grooves (30,31) being substantially perpendicular
to said axis and respective grooves (30,31) on one of said

conductor grips being offset with respect to respective
grooves on the other one of said conductor grips prior to

crimping.
A terminal as claimed in claim 1 wherein said grooves
(30,31) are comprised of channels formed in said conductor

grips (21, 22).
An electrical interconnection system comprising an
insulated multi conductor wire (10) having an axis and

having insulation removed from its end and a crimp-type
terminal (11) as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 crimped to

grip said multi conductor wire with its insulator grip (14)
gripping the insulation (12) and its conductor grips (21,

22) crimped to engage the uninsulated portion of said wire
with their top surfaces and having their respective bottom

surfaces in contact with one another and their respective
grooves (30,31) interlocked.
