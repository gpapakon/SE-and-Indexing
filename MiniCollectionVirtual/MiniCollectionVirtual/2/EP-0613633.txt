<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cream lotion container, in particular for cosmetics, having an inner container (2) which is closed by a tear-off film (10) in the mouth region (M) and can be inserted in an outer housing (1), fitted with a closure lid (12), in such a way that the closure lid (12) projects over the mouth region (M) of the inner container (2). To achieve an optimum tight closure which protects the product, it is proposed that the inner container (2) has an angular channel (13) which surrounds the mouth region (M) in an annular manner for contact of both the tear-off film (10) and an elastic ring seal (14) of the closure lid (12).
