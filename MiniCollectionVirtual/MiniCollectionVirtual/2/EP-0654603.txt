<ABSTRACT>
Capacitor discharge ignition system having a microprocessor disposed thereon 
to control the ignition timing of the system. The system has a generator coil, a 

primary coil and a secondary coil on the same leg portion of a ferromagnetic core. 
An electronic circuit associated with the microprocessor includes a capacitor adapted 

to be charged by an intermediate pulse generated by the charge coil with the leading 
and trailing pulses thereof being input to control the operation of the microprocessor. 

The circuit also includes an SCR having its anode-cathode path connected in circuit 
with the capacitor and primary coil and its gate connected to an output port of the 

microprocessor which also includes an input port to power the microprocessor from 
the charge coil. Another port of the microprocessor is adapted to receive timing 

reference inputs from the charge coil. The microprocessor is programmed to send 
a signal to the SCR that causes the capacitor to discharge through the primary and 

thereby induce an ignition pulse in the secondary. In addition, the microprocessor 
is programmed to be cut "off" and remain "off" for the duration of the ignition pulse.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to capacitor discharge ignition system controlled by a
microprocessor for small engines as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.
A system of this kind is known from US 4 924 831 A.This document (831 Patent)
discloses generally the same type of compact system
as the present invention. The '831 Patent discloses the use of a relatively costly opto-coupler
device for electrically connecting the ignition system to the microprocessor
although no explanation is given in the patent for selecting this type of coupling
device in the system. It has been learned, however, that if a conventional connection
is substituted for the infrared emitting diode and light sensing switch of the opto-coupler
used in the '831 Patent to lower substantially the materials costs of the
system, that serious operating difficulties are encountered related to ignition pulse
"noise" being picked up by the microprocessor. This was the same problem the '831
Patent sought to overcome but since cost of such small engine systems of the type
embodying this invention is of such a paramount importance in that highly 
competitive marketplace, another solution had to be found to solve the "noise"
disruption problem in the operation of the microprocessor.JP-A-55110302 describes an ignition control circuit in which the computer stops
operating temporarily for a period during which strong noise is generated by the ignition
system.It is the principal object of this invention to provide an improved
capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) system in combination with a digital timing control
unit that is simpler, more economical and reliable than similar systems heretofore
available.The above and other objects and advantages of this system will be more
readily apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is an elevational view partly in section of a magnetomotive device of
the type embodying this invention;Fig. 2 is a graphic showing which illustrates wave forms of the type generated
in the operation of the system; andFig. 3 is a schematic wiring diagram of the ignition system of the type
embodying the invention.In Fig. 1, is shown a stator unit 10 and a permanent magnet assembly 12
disposed in the rim of a flywheel 14 fitted onto and rotatable with shaft 16 of an
internal combustion engine and has a keyway 19 at a predetermined angular position
relative to the magnet group. As a result, the shaft 17, such as the crankshaft or 
camshaft, will rotate in synchronism with the
