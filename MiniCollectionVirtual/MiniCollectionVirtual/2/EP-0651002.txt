<ABSTRACT>
Quaternary ammonium salts of a non-nucleophilic 
anion having a 

heterocycle including the quarternary nitrogen atom 
are useful as a cation polymerization initiator 

having a heat latency. A variety of resinous 
compositions containing this initiator is also 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel class of 
cationic polymerization initiators having a heat-latency, 
i.e. which are normally inactive but are 
capable of initiating a cationic polymerization 
reaction only at an elevated temperature. The 
invention also relates to heat-curable resin compositions 
containing these initiators which are useful 
for the preparation of coating, adhesive, printing 
ink and other compositions. A variety of cationic polymerization initiators 
are known including Friedel-Crafts catalysts such as 
aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride-ether complex, 
photo-degradable onium salts (S, Se, Te), diallyl 
iodonium salts and the like. These known initiators 
are generally not selective with respect to the 
reactioin temperature. Therefore, an epoxy resin 
containing these initiators begins to cure even at 
room temperature. Japanese Laid Open Patent Application (Kokai) 
Nos. 37003/83 and 37004/83 disclose another type of 
cationic polymerization initiators. They are  
 
aliphatic or aromatic sulfonium salts capable of 
generating carbonium cations upon heating to an 
elevated temperature. Initiators of this type are 
known as "heat-latent cationic polymerization 
initiator". Cation-polymerizable resins such as 
epoxy resins containing the heat-latent initiator 
are, therefore, normally inactive but capable of 
curing at a temperature above the cleaving temperature 
of the initiator. This provides a heat-curable, 
one-component epoxy resin composion having 
a greater storage-stability and a longer pot life. The carbonium cations produced by the thermal 
cleavage of the heat-latent intiator may react with 
water or a hydroxy group-containing compound to 
generate protons which, in turn, catalyze various 
cross-linking reactions. Accordingly, the heat-latent 
cationic initiator may find uses in catalyzing 
the curing reaction of, for example, polyester 
and acrylic resins with melamine resins. This 
also provides systems having a greater storage 
stability. The heat latent cationic initiator thus has a 
number of advantages over conventional cationic 
initiators or proton-donating catalysts.  
 
Unfortunately, the prior art sulfonium type 
initiators have a serious problem in that their 
sulfur-containing decomposition products are 
malodorous. This limits their uses in practice. Accordingly, a strong need exists for a heat 
latent cationic polymerisation initiator which 
obviates the above defects. In one aspect, the present invention provides a 
compound of the formula: 
wherein M is
