<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a bifunctional recombinant protein comprising a particle-binding antibody or antibody fragment (PBM), and an analyte-binding moiety or molecule (ABM). Preferably, the particle-binding antibody or antibody fragment is an erythrocyte-binding antibody or antibody fragment (EBM), and/or the ABM is selected from the group consisting of an antigenic peptide from an immunodominant region of an env protein of HIV-1 or HIV-2, a gag protein of HIV-1 or HIV-2, and an immunodominant region of the surface antigen of Hepatitis B. Alternatively, the ABM is a single chain Fv region of an antibody directed against an antigen selected from the group consisting of Hepatitis B surface antigen, D-dimer and canine heartworm antigen. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the EBM is a single chain Fv region of an anti-erythrocyte antibody, such as an anti-glycophorin antibody. The protein of the invention is particularly suitable for use in agglutination immunoassays. Methods for producing the protein of the invention, DNA sequences, and assay methods and reagent kits therefor are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REAGENT FOR AGGLUTINATION ASSAYSThe present invention relates to a reagent for use in agglutination assays, and in particular whole blood agglutination assays. The invention also relates to a method for detecting an antigen, antibody or other analyte in a sample using the reagent, and to a kit containing the reagent. The invention describes the use of recombinant DNA methods in E. coli to produce the key reagents for this assay. This application claims priority from AustralianProvisional Patent Application No. PL 2551, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.Background of the Invention Immunoassays and analogous specific binding assays are now very well-known and widely used in a variety of bio edical and other fields. The most commonly used immunoassays utilise complex detection systems involving radioisotopes or enzymes, and suffer from the disadvantage that the assay procedure is lengthy and involved, and requires expensive instrumentation. Radioimmunoassays further suffer from the disadvantage of the radioactive hazard presented by the isotopes. Agglutination immunoassays, using erythrocytes or latex particles as the detection agent, have been proposed as an alternative. Immunoassays and agglutination immunoassays are described in our International Patent Application WO 91/04492, entitled "Agglutination Assay". In particular, our U.S. Patents No. 4,894,347 and No. 5,086,002 describe an agglutination immunoassay designed for use with whole blood samples, in which the endogenous erythrocytes are used as indicating particles, and in which an agglutination reagent comprising an erythrocyte binding molecule conjugated either to an' analyte-binding molecule or to an analyte analogue is used. 

Non-specific agglutination is avoided if the erythrocyte binding molecule recognises an abundant, well-distributed erythrocyte membrane constituent such as glycophorin. WO 91/04492 describes an autologous agglutination assay of improved sensitivity. The entire disclosures of U.S. Patent No. 4,894,347 and International Patent Application No. WO 91/04492 are also incorporated herein by reference.Conventional immunoassays, and some agglutination assays, require the isolation of serum or plasma, which in turn usually requires electrical power and specialised equipment, and consequently is very difficult under field conditions or in remote or under-developed areas. It is therefore highly desirable to be able to use a test system which can utilise whole blood, and which requires a minimum of
