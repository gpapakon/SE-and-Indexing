<CLAIMS>
A carbon brush, which is impregnated with an impregnating agent, particularly a
carbon brush for tools put under a great deal of stress,
characterized in that,

the carbon brush is impregnated with a mixture of ester oil and a synthetic hydrocarbon
oil.
A carbon brush according to Claim 1,
characterized in that,

the ester oil is a synthetic ester oil, such as carboxylic acid ester or dicarboxylic acid
ester.
A carbon brush according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that,

the ester oil has a kinematic viscosity of approximately 14 mm
2
/s at a temperature of
100°C and a kinematic viscosity of approximately 63 mm
2
/s at a temperature of 40°C.
A carbon brush according to Claim 3,
characterized in that,

at 20°C, the synthetic ester oil has a density of approximately 0.92 g/cm
3
.
The carbon brush according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that,
 
the impregnated carbon brush contains from 0.5 - 15 weight percent impregnating

agent by weight, preferably 5 weight percent.
A process for impregnating a carbon brush or a carbon bar,
characterized in that,

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is impregnated with a mixture of ester oil and a
synthetic hydrocarbon oil.
The process according to Claim 6,
characterized in that,

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is immersed in the mixture of ester oil and
synthetic hydrocarbon oil over a period of time t where preferably 0.5 h 
<
 t 
<
 5 h,
then excess ester oil is removed by draining, and finally the carbon brush or bar is

dried at a temperature T, where preferably 50°C 
<
 T 
<
 90°C.
The process according to Claim 7,
characterized in that,

the carbon brush or carbon bar is dried for a period of time t where 15 
<
 t 
<
 20 min,
where preferably t = 10 min.
The process according to one of claims 6 to 8 at least,
characterized in that,

the carbon brush or the carbon bar is spun during the drying.
