<ABSTRACT>
A coffee brewing apparatus comprising a housing (1) 
including a water reservoir, a coffeepot arrangement position 

(2), a filter holder (3), an on/off subswitch (4) for 
switching the entire apparatus on and off, and a shut-off 

valve (5) connected with the filter holder (3) for closing the 
filter holder (3), the on/off subswitch (4) and the shut-off 

valve (5) being responsive to the presence/absence of a 
coffeepot (6) at the coffeepot arrangement position (2), and 

further comprising a filter holder support bracket (7) 
connected with the housing (1), which bracket (7) comprises an 

operating element (8) adapted for cooperation with the 
coffeepot (6) and for operation of the shut-off valve (5) on 

the one hand and the on/off subswitch (4) on the other, while 
the filter holder (3) is freely placeable on the filter holder 

support bracket (7) and, in the condition wherein it is placed 
on the filter holder support bracket (7), is locked in 

vertical direction by locking means (9, 10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coffee brewing apparatus 
comprising a housing including a water reservoir, a coffeepot 
arrangement position, a filter holder, an on/off subswitch for 
switching the entire apparatus on and off, and a shut-off 
valve connected with the filter holder for closing the filter 
holder, the on/off subswitch and the shut-off valve being 
responsive to the presence/absence of a coffeepot at the 
coffeepot arrangement position. 
Such an apparatus is disclosed in EP-A-0350199. The most important disadvantage of the above apparatus 
and those known from practice is that the filter 
holder is either hinged to the housing for swivelling movement 
or slidably connected with a lid of the coffee brewing 
apparatus by way of a guide track. This was considered 
necessary to prevent the filter holder from being pushed 
upwards by the upwardly directed force which the coffeepot, as 
it being placed on the coffeepot arrangement position, exerts 
on a valve lever of the shut-off valve of the filter holder. 
However, sliding a filter holder into a guide track is an 
operation which must be performed accurately because otherwise 
the filter holder may easily be positioned incorrectly. An 
incorrectly positioned filter holder may slip and thereby 
cause spill of boiling water, which can give rise to a 
particularly dangerous situation. The most important drawbacks 
of filter holders which are hinged to the housing of the 
coffee brewing apparatus are that they cannot be simply  
 
removed for the purpose of cleaning them and that they are 
constructively complicated. The object of the invention is to provide a coffee 
brewing apparatus of the type mentioned in the opening 
paragraph hereof without the above-mentioned drawbacks. To that end, the coffee brewing apparatus is 
characterized by a filter holder support bracket, provided 
above the coffeepot arrangement position and connected with 
the housing, which comprises an operating element adapted for 
cooperation with the coffeepot and for operation of the shut-off 
valve on the one hand and the on/off subswitch on the 
other, while the filter holder is freely placeable on the 
filter holder support bracket and, in the condition wherein it 
is placed on the filter holder support bracket, is locked in 
vertical direction by locking means. A coffee brewing apparatus of such design combines the 
advantageous features of a filter holder shut-off valve 
openable by the coffeepot and an on/off subswitch operable by 
the coffeepot, with a freely
