filled with a fluid medium and are connected to one 
another by a channel (9), one (7) of which is arranged in 

the heel region (11) and the other (8) in the front 
region of the sole, the pads (7, 8) together with the 

connecting channel (9) being able to be fitted as a 
complete and uniformly flexible unit into a correspondingly 

dimensioned cavity (5) of the sole and the 
connecting channel being dimensioned such that the other 

pad (8), arranged in the front region of the sole, is 
situated in the front region (13) of the foot, in particular 

in the region of the ball of the foot, characterized 
in that the fluid medium comprises solid 

particles, in particular cork or plastic particles (18), 
and in that the sole, at least in the region of the 

connecting channel (9) between the two pads (7, 8), has 
a viewing window (23) through which the flow of fluid 

between the two pads (7, 8) can be watched. 
Sole according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a gel-like liquid is used as fluid medium. 
Sole according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the solid particles (18) are dyed to contrast with 

the fluid medium, so that they, and consequently the flow 
of fluid between the two pads (7, 8), can be clearly seen 

through the viewing window (23). 
Sole according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that viewing windows (24, 25) are also formed 

in the region of the two pads (7, 8). 
Sole according to Claim 1 and/or 4, characterized

that a lateral viewing window (26) facing the pad (7) 

arranged in the heel region (11) is formed at least in 
the heel region (11) of the sole. 
Sole according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the connecting channel (9; 9', 9'') 

between the two pads (7, 8) is led towards the outside of 
the sole in the middle region (12) of the foot, so that 

the flow of fluid in the connecting channel (9; 9', 9'') 
can be watched during walking through a lateral viewing 

window (27 and/or 28) arranged there. 
Sole according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the unit (6) formed by the two pads (7, 

8) and their connecting channel (9) is filled only 
partly, in particular approximately to 2/3 of its maximum 

volume, with a liquid medium. 
Sole according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the unit (6) is filled with a liquid damping medium with 

the exclusion of air. 
Sole according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the unit (6) is filled with a liquid damping medium with 

the inclusion of a predetermined volume of air or inert 
gas, in particular nitrogen. 
Sole according to one of Claims 8 to 10, characterized 
in that the filling of the unit (6) comprises an 

elastically compliant, in particular open-cell, sponge. 
Sole according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that the cavity (5) for accom
modating the pads 
(7, 8) together with the connecting channel (9) is formed 

within a separate damping wedge (3) arranged beneath the 
insole (2). 
Sole according to Claim 12, characterized in that 
the damping wedge (3) is produced from PU foam, a 

cork/rubber mixture or similar damping material. 
Sole according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that the pads (7, 8) together with the connecting  

 
channel (9) are formed in the manner of a pouch, 

in particular a flat pouch, the walls consisting of 
plastic films welded together at the edges. 
Sole according to Claim 14, characterized in that 
one wall (15) is thermoformed to form the two pads (7, 8) 

and the connecting channel (9), while the other wall is 
formed by a flat top film (16).
