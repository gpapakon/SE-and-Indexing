<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for purifying exhaust gas comprising crystalline 
iridium silicate having a Si/Ir atomic ratio of 50 to 800 

and a Si/Al atomic ratio of not less than 15. The catalyst 
exhibits excellent activity and selectivity when used for 

purification of, and specifically for eliminating NOx from, 
an exhaust gas which contains reducing components including 

hydrocarbons, oxygen in excess of the stoichiometric 
quantity necessary for completely oxidizing all of the 

reducing components, and nitrogen oxides. The catalyst is 
highly durable to hydrothermal aging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for 
purifying exhaust gases which are discharged from internal-combustion 
engines, boilers, gas turbines or the like and 
contain nitrogen oxides together with excess oxygen, and to 
a method for purifying the exhaust gases. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from internal-combustion 
engines and the like may cause photochemical 
smog and acid rain, and elimination of NOx from their 
Sources is urgently needed. For elimination of NOx from exhaust gases from large-scale 
fixed sources such as electric power plants, 
heretofore, a selective catalytic reduction method has been 
used in which ammonia is added to the exhaust gas and a 
TiO2-V2O5 catalyst is used. For eliminating NOx from 
exhaust gases from gasoline engines of automobiles and the 
like, on the other hand, a three-way catalyst (TWC) method 
has been used in which air-fuel ratio is controlled into 
the vicinity of the stoichiometric value (A/F = 14.6) and a 
Pt-Rh/Al2O3 catalyst is used to thereby eliminate NOx 
simultaneously with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons 
(HC).  
 Meanwhile, in order to prevent the earth's surface 
temperature from rising due to air pollution, it has become 
required in recent years to control emission of carbon 
dioxide (NOx) and to put into practical use a lean-burn 
gasoline engine in which gasoline is burned at a air-fuel 
ratio on the "leaner" side of the stoichiometric value. 
Exhaust gases from such lean-burn gasoline engines cannot 
be treated effectively with the three-way catalyst method . In addition, diesel engines inherently are lean-burn 
engines, and elimination of NOx from their exhaust gases is 
also a problem of great urgency. These lean-burn gasoline engines, diesel engines and 
other engines of the lean burn type are generically called 
lean-burn engines. Exhaust gas from a lean-burn engine contains 
oxidants, oxygen (O2) and NOx in excess of the 
stoichiometrically necessary quantity for complete 
oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC) (the term "hydrocarbons" 
herein refers to not only hydrocarbons in a narrow sense 
but also partially oxidized products thereof such as 
oxygenated hydrocarbons, for example, alcohols and ketones) 
which are products of incomplete oxidation of the fuel, CO 
and reducing components such as hydrogen (H2), etc. 
Specifically, the exhaust gas may contain oxygen in such a 
high concentration as to give an air-fuel ratio A/F of 17 
or more. It has long been an unsolved problem to achieve 
selective elimination of NOx from exhaust
