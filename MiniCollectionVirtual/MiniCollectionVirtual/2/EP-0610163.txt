<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a system
activated by radiant energy for thermal and
microclimatic conditioning of small
greenhouses, seed beds, and tanks for
hydroponics and aquiculture.The invention, which integrates the structure
of the culture tank with collectors, storage
tanks and controlling elements, makes the use
of solar energy convenient also in small
systems.In the field of ornamental aquiculture, the 
invention brings a remarkable innovation, making
it possible the growth and breeding of
freshwater tropical flora and fauna in a garden
or on a terrace.For thermal conditioning of little garden or
balcony greenhouses, it is usually employed an
electric heating with convectors, finned
surfaces or heating cables.There's another conditioning system which
makes use of stoves, but the problems
concerning their installation and maintenance
make them inconvenient for small systems.For the forcing of seed bed cultures, beside
the common method of the manure bed, it is
possible to employ also heating cables.The employment of solar energy is limited to
bigger systems, since for a little balcony
greenhouse or seed bed it is not convenient to
install solar collectors, storage tanks, and
plumbing and controlling elements.In the field of ornamental naturalistic
aquiculture, the invention is an innovation
compared to what industry has been offering up
to now: interiors aquariums or garden ponds.For aquatic flora and fauna, ponds and garden
pools are a more natural environment than the
aquarium, because they have better chances of
autoregulation; this is due to the action of
sunlight and to the contribution of allochthon
substances from the environment. People fond of
aquariums, who breed tropical fishes in outdoor
ponds during the summer, find it advantageous
for the size, color, and liveliness of the
animals. The garden pools and ponds available on the market today, employ
either PVC or similar
materials liners, or fiberglass or plastic
materials tanks to be interred or simply laid on
the ground. Because of the great faying surface
with both the ground and the atmosphere, with
this kind of ponds the heat stored during the
exposure to the sunlight is soon released, and
they assume quickly the environment temperature.
The growth and breeding of freshwater tropical
flora and fauna, requiring a minimum temperature
of 22-23 C, is therefore limited to few months
in a year.In this field DE-A-3114952 (D1) discloses a
device for microclimatic conditioning comprising
a tank without any bottom wall which excludes
