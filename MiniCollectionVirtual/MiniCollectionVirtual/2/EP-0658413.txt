<ABSTRACT>
A method of and an apparatus for knead-extruding a plastic resin which are free from the drawbacks encountered in conventional 
method and apparatus of this kind, and which have a high extrusion operation efficiency, the apparatus being provided 

with a single auxiliary unit having a screw driving power source and a resin hopper, and a plurality of extrusion units each of 
which has a resin inlet-carrying cylinder and a screw, the operation of each extrusion unit consisting of an extrusion step for 

knead-extruding a resin, and a cleaning step for cleaning the screws and cylinders, the extrusion step and cleaning step being carried 
out alternately in order in each extrusion unit. This invention enables an integrated continuous extrusion operation to be carried 

out without causing the extrusion steps to be interrupted by the cleaning steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kneading/extruding
method of
plastic resins according to the preamble of claim 1.From the JP-A-57 077 541 an injection molding apparatus is known
which comprises one auxiliary equipment including a
screw drive source for a plurality of heater cylinders. Further
there are provided a plurality of hoppers for resins of different
colors. The heater cylinders are turnably supported in order to facilitate
the changeover work which is caused when a resin of a
different color shall be used. Another kneading/extruding method and apparatus of
plastic resins are composed of an extruding unit and
an auxiliary equipment and their operations.The extruding unit is composed of a cylinder with
a feed opening and a screw for kneading and extruding
a resin. The extruding unit performs the kneading/extruding
operation at an extruding step zone and the
cleaning operation at a cleaning step zone.The auxiliary equipment is mainly composed of a
hopper and a drive source. The hopper feeds the resin
to the extruding unit from a feed opening, and the
drive source drives the screw. The operations continuously circulates in the sequence
of the extruding step zone, the cleaning step
zone and the extruding step zone.Although the extruding operation should be main,
it has to be interrupted at the cleaning step zone.
It is the defects of the method and apparatus of the
prior art that the extruding efficiency must drop according
to the interruption.An object of the present invention is to realize
the kneading/extruding method comprising an improved
extruding efficiencyThis object is achieved by a method according to claim 1. The extruding units are disposed in
such relative positions as can have their positions
interchanged with their feed openings being always
held upright. The extruding units are disposed in
such relative positions that one of them is set in an
extruding position for an extruding step and used as
an active extruding unit whereas the remaining extruding
unit other than the active extruding unit is set
in a cleaning position for a cleaning step and used as
a cleaning unit. The active extruding unit has its
position interchanged, when it is to be cleaned, by
that of the cleaning unit.Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are a side elevation and a
transverse section of the case of two extruding units.
Fig. 3 is a transverse section of the case of four extruding
units. Fig. 4 is a side elevation of the case
in which a feed opening is upright; Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and
Fig. 8 are transverse sections of the same
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plastic resin kneading/extruding method using one auxiliary
equipment including a screw drive source and a resin feed

hopper, and a plurality of extruding units each including a
cylinder with a feed opening and a screw,


said extruding units are disposable in relative positions,
namely

said method comprises the following steps:
one of the extruding units is positioned in an extruding
position and subsequently
an extruding step is performed by said extruding unit so
that it is used as an active extruding unit,
characterized in that
at the same time a remaining extruding unit other than the
active extruding unit is positioned in a cleaning position and

subsequently
a cleaning step is performed so that said extruding unit is
in an inactive state and is cleaned; and that
after completion of the cleaning step said inactive
extruding unit is positioned again in the extruding position

while at the same time said extruding unit being active before
in an extruding step in the extruding position is positioned in

the cleaning position to repeat the cycle of extruding and
cleaning in a continuous manner.
