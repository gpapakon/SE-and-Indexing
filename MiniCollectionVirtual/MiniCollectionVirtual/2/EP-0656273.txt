<ABSTRACT>
The device eliminates water droplets from adhering to an 
evaporator (6) of an automotive air conditioner after the vehicle 

as been shut off or stopped. In order to park a vehicle, a vehicle 
driver switches off an ignition switch device, which also switches 

off an accessory switch (34), unfastens a seatbelt, and exits the 
vehicle. Thereupon, after switching off of the accessory switch 

(34), when time t elapses, a control circuit (24) sequentially 
executes a series of steps to recognize the parked state from the 

three conditions of switching off of a seatbelt switch (35), a 
no-rider signal of a rider sensor (36), and switching off of a 

door-lock switch (37). Thereupon, the control circuit announces 
operation of a blower (5) by means of a notification device, then 

sets various dampers so as to enable an inner air intake mode, 
heater core bypass mode, and face mode, and operates the blower (5) 

at high. Thereupon, water droplets adhering to an evaporator (6) 
are blown away and removed by means of blown air from this blower 

(5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an air-conditioning apparatus according
to the preamble of claim 1.Such an air-conditioning apparatus is known from DE-A-40 23 046.
As humidity is condensed on the surface of the evaporator the
blower continues to operate for a certain period of time after
the engine of the vehicle is shut down so that the surface of the
evaporator will be dry before the engine is started again. In
this way the condensation of humidity in the passenger compartment
should be avoided when the engine is started again.JP-A-54 159759 discloses a water-repellent film on the surface
of an aluminium fin of a heat exchanger. In order to perform highly efficient heat exchange with
the air inside the vehicle (recirculate) or the air outside the
vehicle, an evaporator is structured by installing a large number
of fins on a tube through which refrigerant passes. In the
cooling operation of the evaporator, the surface temperature of
the fins is at or below the dew-point temperature of air, and so
moisture in the air becomes frost or water droplets and adheres 
to the fins. When frost or water droplets adhere to the fins,
the clearance between the fins is narrowed, the amount of air
flow may be reduced, odors may be generated, and corrosion may
be caused.Odor generation and corrosion due to water droplets are
susceptible to worsening in the case where the air conditioner
is stopped for long periods such as when the vehicle is parked,
and with regard to odor in particular the direct effect of
blowing air containing unpleasant odors into the interior of the
vehicle when restarting the air conditioner is unpleasant, to say
the least, to passengers in the vehicle. For this reason, it is
desirable to take measures so that water droplets do not continue
to adhere to the evaporator when the vehicle is parked.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 54-159759
discloses a device directed to eliminating water droplets from
an evaporator. This device forms a water-repellent film on the
evaporator fin surface, facilitating the movement of water
droplets and improving the water-shedding performance of the
fins. Thus, water droplets that do form on the fins are easily
blown away by blown air from the blower so that water droplets
do not remain on the fins while the air conditioner is stopped.When an air conditioner is switched off, the blower fan
is rotated for a short time by inertia, but because the amount
of blown air thereof decreases suddenly, water droplets adhering
to the evaporator when the air conditioner is

interval with a sufficient speed wind for dispersing condensed
moisture adhering to said evaporator (6) when a parked state of a

vehicle has been detected by said parking detection means,
characterized in that a water-repellent film is formed on the

surfaces of the evaporator (6) and a water-catching net (17) is
disposed on the downstream side surface of said evaporator (6).
An air-conditioning apparatus for vehicle use
