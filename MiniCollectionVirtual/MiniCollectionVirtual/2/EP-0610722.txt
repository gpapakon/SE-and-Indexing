<ABSTRACT>
In a double-cone burner, at least one row of nozzles (10) for a fuel (15) containing highly reactive gaseous components and having a medium calorific value is mounted on the circumference of the partial conical bodies (1, 2) of the burner in the vicinity of the burner outlet, at a distance of about 30% of the nominal diameter of the burner. In addition, there is a fuel line (11) and a distributing channel (17), positioned in the region of the nozzles (10), for the highly reactive fuel. The fuel (15) containing highly reactive gaseous components is injected at high speed through the nozzles (10), which have a diameter of less than 1% of the nominal diameter of the burner, into the zones of high air speed and the depth of penetration and the direction of the fuel jets are matched to one another in such a way that ignition following mixing takes place only after the burner.

Burner for operating an internal combustion 
engine, a combustion chamber of a gas turbine group or 

firing installation, the burner consisting essentially 
of at least two partial hollow semi-conical bodies (1, 

2) whose longitudinal axes of symmetry extend radially 
offset relative to one another so that at least two 

tangential air inlet slots (4, 5) are produced for a 
combustion airflow, it being possible to place at least 

one nozzle (3) in the hollow conical space (6) formed 
by the partial conical bodies (1,. 2) at the burner head 

for injecting a liquid fuel (13) into the hollow 
conical space (6) and it being possible to complement 

the partial conical bodies (1, 2) in the region of the 
tangential air inlet slots (4, 5) by means (7, 8, 9) 

for the supplementary supply of a further gaseous fuel 
(14), wherein at least one row of nozzles (10) is 

introduced, on the periphery of the partial conical 

bodies (1, 2) near the burner outlet, at a distance 
from the burner outlet of up to 30% of the nominal 

burner diameter, for the gaseous fuel (15) containing 
highly reactive components and having a medium 

calorific value and there is a fuel conduit (11) and a 
distributing passage (17), placed in the region of the 

nozzles (10), for the highly reactive fuel (15), the 
two systems for injecting the gaseous fuels (14, 15) 

being arranged independently of one another. 
Burner according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the diameter of each individual nozzle (10) is 

smaller than 1% of the burner nominal diameter. 
Burner according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that there are fifteen nozzles (10). 
Method for operating a burner according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the gaseous fuel (15) 

containing highly reactive components and having a 
medium calorific value is injected at high velocity 

through the nozzles (10) near the burner outlet into 
the zones of high air velocity and the penetration  

 
depth and direction of the fuel jets are matched to one 

another in such a way that ignition only takes place 
behind the burner, after mixing has been completed. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that in the two independent systems for injecting 

gaseous fuel, fuels (14) having a high calorific value 
and low reactivity, on the one hand, and fuels (15) 

having a high reactivity and medium calorific value, on 
the other, are supplied. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the burner is operated in mixed operation with 

both types of gas injection with one or two different 
gaseous fuels (14, 15). 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the burner is operated with a liquid fuel (13).
