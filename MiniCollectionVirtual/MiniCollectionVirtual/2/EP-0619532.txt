<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a fuser member, a method for fabricating the fuser
member, and a method of fusing toner images in electrostatographic reproducing apparatus.
In particular, the present invention relates to a fuser member which may preferably take the
form of a fuser roll, pressure roll or release agent donor roll containing an overcoating of a
ceramer composition.In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to
be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive
member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of
electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner. The visible
toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily disturbed or destroyed. The
toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a support which may be the photosensitive member
itself or other support sheet such as plain paper.The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is well
known, and several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner images have been
described in the prior art. These methods include providing the application of heat and
pressure substantially concurrently by various means: a roll pair maintained in pressure
contact; a belt member in pressure contact with a roll; and the like. Heat may be applied by
heating one or both of the rolls, plate members or belt members. The fusing of the toner
particles takes place when the proper combination of heat, pressure and contact time are
provided. The balancing of these parameters to achieve the fusing of the toner particles is well
known in the art, and they can be adjusted to suit particular machines or process conditions.A recent development in fusing systems involves the use of fluoroelastomers as fuser
members which have a surface with a metal containing filler including a metal oxide. The
polymeric release agents having functional groups interact with the metal containing filler in
the fluoroelastomer surface. Such fusing systems, fusing members and release agents, are
described in US-A-4,264,181, US-A-4,257,699, and US-A-4,272,179.However, a significant problem of the fluoroelastomer/metal oxide material such as
Viton/copper oxide is its relative instability against certain charge control additives which
reduces the life of the fusing components, especially for fusing of colored toner. Thus, there is
a need for a fusing component material which exhibits one or more of
