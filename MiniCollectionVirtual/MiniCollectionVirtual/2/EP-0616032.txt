<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preventive or a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease and a method of screening Alzheimer's disease. More particularly, it relates to a preventive or a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease using a tau-protein kinase I inhibitor; a method of screening a preventive or a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease utilizing an amyloid beta-protein.Alzheimer's disease is a progressive dementia which develops in late middle ages (45 to 65 years old) and its etiological changes are shrinkage of cerebral cortex due to a neuronal cell loss and degeneration of the neurons while, from the pathological view, many senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are noted in the brain. There is no pathologically substantial difference between the disease and senile dementia caused by the so-called natural aging which develops in the senile period of 65 years and older ages and, therefore, this is called senile dementia of Alzheimer type.Numbers of the patients of this disease are increasing with an increase of population of aged people and the disease is becoming serious in the society. There are various theories on the cause of this disease but, the cause has been still ambiguous and, accordingly, there has been a demand for prompt clarification.It has been known that the quantities which appear in the two pathological changes which are characteristic to Alzheimer's disease and to senile dementia of Alzheimer type are well correlated with the degree of cognitive impairement. Accordingly, studies for clarifying the cause of those diseases by clarifying, in a molecular level, the accumulated insoluble substances resulting in those two pathological changes have been carried out since the first half of the 1980's.It has been clarified already that a main component of the senile plaques which is one of those pathological changes is amyloid beta-protein (hereinafter, it may be abbreviated as "AÎ²P") [Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 12, 463-490 (1989)]. A neurofibrillary tangle which is another pathological change is due to an accumulation of a double-stranded fibrous substance called PHF (paired helical filament) in the neurons and, recently, the components thereof have been identified as ubiquitin and tau-protein which is one of the microtubule-associated proteins characteristic to brain [J. Biochem., 99, 1807-1810 (1986); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83, 4913-4917 (1986)].It is believed now that, in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid beta-protein is extremely accumulated in the neurons and that,
