<ABSTRACT>
A surface-emitting laser with an integral 
nonlinear crystal (19) generates light at a 

fundamental frequency. The nonlinear crystal 
converts the light into light at twice the fundamental 

frequency. The laser is configured in a vertical-cavity, 
surface-emitting structure. An adhesive layer (17) 

containing indium such as indium gallium phosphide is 
disposed between a phosphide nonlinear crystal (19) 

and an arsenide optical amplifier (15). The optical 
amplifier and the nonlinear crystal are fused together. 

The optical amplifier and the nonlinear crystal are 
located inside a laser cavity (29) that is defined 

between a pair of reflectors (13,21). One of the 
reflectors (21) is located adjacent the nonlinear crystal 

and is highly reflective of light at the fundamental 
frequency but transmissive of light at twice the 

fundamental frequency. Light is generated at the 
fundamental frequency, doubled in frequency as it 

passes back and forth through the nonlinear crystal, and 

emitted (31,35) through the reflector adjacent the 
nonlinear crystal. An intracavity reflector (33) may be 

included between the optical amplifier and the nonlinear 
crystal to prevent light at twice the fundamental 

frequency from propagating from the nonlinear crystal 
into the optical amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to lasers 
and more particularly to a semiconductor laser that 
generates second harmonic light by means of a nonlinear 
crystal attached to a semiconductor optical amplifier in 
the laser cavity. There has been a need for an inexpensive, compact 
source of blue light for use in applications as diverse 
as flat displays for computers and entertainment systems, 
medical devices, analytical instruments, data storage, 
and optical communications. A semiconductor laser that 
could produce blue light would meet these requirements of 
low cost and small size. Semiconductor lasers have been 
used successfully to generate relative long-wavelength 
light such as green light (about 5,200 Å, 1 nm = 10 Å), red light 
(about 6,500 Å), or infrared (7,000 Å to over 100,000 Å). 
However, blue light has a relatively short wavelength 
(about 4,700 Ångstroms) and lasers made of semiconductor 
materials have not given satisfactory results at such 
short wavelengths. Some kinds of light-emitting diodes ("LEDs") are 
capable of emitting blue light. However, LEDs can only 
emit light over a relatively broad spectrum and therefore 
are not suitable for applications that require a single 
wavelength or a narrow range of wavelengths. In 
addition, the output power of LEDs is too low for many 
applications. Lasers can generate light at a single 
wavelength, but most lasers, especially semiconductor 
lasers, have not been able to generate light with a  
 
wavelength as short as that of blue light. For example, 
lasers fabricated of group III-V semiconductor compounds 
(usually compounds of gallium, indium or aluminum with 
arsenic or phosphorus such as AlGaAs or AlGaInP) do not 
produce significant energy--at room temperature--at 
wavelengths shorter than about 5,500 Å. Other 
semiconductor light sources are very weak (e.g. silicon 
carbide), have a very short lifetime (e.g. polymers) or 
are too soft to work with easily and are not sufficiently 
reliable as yet (e.g. group II-VI compounds). A semiconductor laser that can produce blue light 
was first reported by Hasse et al. in Applied Physics 
Letters, vol. 59, page 1272 (1991). This device is 
fabricated of a zinc-cadmium-sulfur-selenium compound and 
works at an extremely low temperature of 77°K (-196°C), 
not at room temperature. Continuous wave ("CW") devices 
that work at room temperature with reasonable lifetimes 
have not been reported. Another approach to generating coherent short-wavelength 
light is through a second harmonic
