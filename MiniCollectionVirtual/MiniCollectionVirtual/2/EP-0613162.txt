<ABSTRACT>
In an electric switch, a movable contact element (6) 
is linked to a first fixed contact (3) by an 

end portion (14) having a sharp-edge outline and 
housed in a seating having a rounded outline (15). The 

movable contact element (6) has an interconnecting 
portion (9) provided with a frusto-conical 

projection to be engaged in a coupling opening (18) 
having rounded edges and formed in a second fixed 

contact (4), so as to establish an electric 
continuity between the first and second fixed contacts 

when the movable contact element (6) is brought to 
a closed condition. A first silver insert (16) is 

joined on the interconnecting portion (9), which 
insert has a larger volume than a second silver insert 

possibly joined on the edges of the coupling opening 
(18). A protection cap (20) arranged on the 

interconnecting portion (9) receives the metal 
fragments projected from the contact area between said 

interconnecting portion and the second fixed contact (4) 
following breaking and restoring of an electric 

continuity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interconnecting 
device between contacts in electric switches and the 
like, of the type comprising 
the features recited in the preamble of claim 1. In particular but not exclusively, the invention applies 
to electric switches or similar devices such as 
alternating current change-over switches, double-throw 
switches, etc. exhibiting relatively reduced sizes as 
they are intended for use mainly on household appliances 
and similar apparatus and designed to operate at current 
values that may reach 16 A at 250 V. It is known that electric switches of the above type 
essentially comprise at least a first and a second fixed 
contacts rigidly supported by a casing made of plastic 
material and connected to respective poles of an 
electric circuit. Housed in the plastics casing is a movable contact 
element that, through control means manually accessible  
 
from the outside of the casing, can be moved with 
alternate motion between at least one closure condition 
in which an electric continuity is established between 
the fixed contacts, and an open condition in which the 
electric continuity is broken. In greater detail, the movable contact element is 
normally in engagament with the first fixed contact in 
an electric continuity relationship, while being capable 
of angular oscillation. This engagement is effected by a 
linking portion of rounded outline arranged on the first 
fixed contact or, alternatively, the movable contact 
element, operatively housed in a seating defined by a 
concavity of rounded outline exhibited by the movable 
contact element or, alternatively, the first fixed 
contact. Practically, actuation and breakage of the current flow 
between the fixed contacts take place at the moment that 
an appropriate interconnecting portion carried by the 
movable contact element respectively touches and moves 
away from a corresponding rest seating arranged on the 
second fixed contact. US Patent number 4,524,253 discloses an eletric switch 
having the features cited by the preamble of claim 1. In particular, such a document shows a movable contact 
element exhibiting a linking portion arranged to act 
oscillatably on a first fixed contact and at least one 
interconnecting portion facing toward the second fixed 
contact. The first fixed contact exhitits an end portion having a 
sharp edge outline and operating in a seating having a 
rounded outline provided on the linking portion of the 
movable contact. The interconnecting portion of the movable contact

An interconnecting device between contacts in 
electric switches and the like, comprising: 


at least a first (3, 103) and a second (4, 104) fixed 
contacts electrically connected to first and second 

poles of an electric circuit, respectively; 
at least one movable contact element (6, 106)

about the linking portion (8, 108), between an opening 

condition in which said interconnecting portion (9, 109) 
is spaced apart from the second fixed contact (4, 104) 

and a closure condition in which the interconnecting 
portion (9, 109) acts in contact relationship against 

the second fixed contact (4, 104) in order to establish 
an electric continuity between the first and second 

fixed contacts,
