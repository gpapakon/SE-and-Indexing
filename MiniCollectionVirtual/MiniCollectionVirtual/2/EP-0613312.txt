<ABSTRACT>
A signal demodulating apparatus comprises: an 
input terminal (11) for inputting an external signal; a 

delay line (12) connected to the input terminal, for 
outputting a first delay signal obtained by delaying the 

external signal by a predetermined time; a phase 
corrector (13) responsive to the first delay signal 

outputted by the delay line, for correcting phase of the 
first delay signal on the basis of a phase difference 

detection signal and outputting the first phase-corrected 
delay signal as a second delay signal; and a phase 

difference detector (16, 15, 19, 20) for detecting a 
phase difference between the second delay signal 

outputted by said phase corrector and the external signal 
inputted through the input terminal and for outputting 

the phase difference detection signal to the phase 
corrector to correct the phase difference to a 

predetermined value. Whenever the delay time of the 
delay signal disperses due to a manufacturing error or a 

change with the lapse of time of the delay line (12), it 
is possible to automatically correct an offset of the 

phase difference from a normal value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a PAL signal demodulating
apparatus.A PAL signal demodulating apparatus is known from EP-A-0 117 374
and comprises an input terminal for inputting an external
signal, delaying means connected to the input terminal for
outputting a first delayed signal obtained by delaying the
external signal by a predetermined time, a phase corrector
responsive to the first delayed signal outputted by the
delaying means, for correcting the phase of the first delayed
signal on the basis of the phase difference detection signal
and for outputting the first phase-corrected delayed signal
as a second delayed signal, and a phase difference detector
for detecting a phase difference between the second delayed
signal outputted by the phase corrector and the external
signal inputted through the input terminal and for outputting
the phase difference detection signal to the phase corrector
to correct the phase difference to a predetermined value.The similar arrangement is shown in DE-C-1 228 123.A PAL-Decoder comprising a delay line is disclosed in "PAL
with Averaging Through a Delay Line (Standard-PAL-Decoder)"
by W. Bruch in Special Edition of Telefunken-Zeitung, June
1966, page 1.7-1.9. A further signal demodulating apparatus of the above kind is
shown in EP-A-0 511 682 and comprises an input terminal,
delaying means, a phase corrector and a phase difference
corrector as previously described. The phase difference
corrector according to EP-A-0 511 682 comprises a multiplier
responsive to the second delayed signal and the external
signal for obtaining and outputting the phase difference
between these signals, and a filter responsive to the phase
difference signal for eliminating noise components from the
phase difference signal to generate an output correction
signal to said phase corrector. As a signal demodulating apparatus of the prior art related to the
present invention, a PAL (phase alternation line) signal
demodulating apparatus will be described hereinbelow by
way of example, with reference to Fig. 4. In the PAL
signal demodulating apparatus shown in Fig. 4, capacitors
C1 and C2, a resistor R1, a variable resistor R3, a tank
coil L1 and a coil L2 are provided as external parts at
the periphery of a delay line 13 (e.g., a glass delay
line). The capacitor C2 and the variable resistor R3 are
connected in series between an input terminal 32 (to
which a PAL chroma signal is inputted) and a node N3.
The node N3 is directly connected to one input terminal
of the delay line 13 and to the other
