<ABSTRACT>
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and metering 
system for washing machines, in particular dishwashing 

and clothes washing machines, comprising a reservoir (13) 
adapted to hold the powdered detergent (11), whose 

addition into the washing tank or tub (24; 681) of said 
machines occurs through a flow of air generated by 

pneumatic generator means (14, 46; 14) of a 
per s√®
 known 
type. The system comprises actuation means (16; 85) 

that may be embodied in a number of different ways, 
described in the patent specification, for determining 

the conveyance of the powdered detergent into the washing 
tank or tub (24; 681) when said pneumatic generator means 

(14, 46; 14) are operating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic powdered
detergent dispensing and metering system for washing
machines, in particular dishwashing machines and clothes
washing machines, comprising the features
described in the main claim appended hereto. From US-A-3188146 is known an automatic dispenser for powder detergents for use in
connection with automatic washing machines and automatic dishwashers, said dispenser being
communicating at its lower side through a feeder plate with an underlying conduit connected
to a pneumatic generator means such as a centrifugal fan and communicating with the tub of
the machine through an air-lift tube. In turn, the conduit is connected in parallel to a by-pass
conduit and such conduits are associated to a slide gate driven by a solenoid in a manner to
permit the passage of air generated by the centrifugal fan in either one of the conduit or the
by-pass conduit.In this way, the powdered detergent contained in the dispenser is dispensed
by gravity through the feeder plate with a Venturi effect into the conduit, so that the flow of
air generated by the fan picks up the powdered detergent in the conduit and permits to transport
such detergent toward the machine tub, by passing through the air-lift tube, when the slide
gate is driven in a position in which the conduit is communicating directly with the tub
through said air-lift tube, and prevents the transport of such detergent toward the machine
tub when the slide gate is driven in the other position thereof, in which the conduit is communicating
with the tub through said by-pass conduit so as the air flows through said by- pass
conduit and said air-lift tube and creates a scavening action therein, to eliminate the possibility
of moisture accumulating in the tube and to dry out any moisture which might have condensed
therein. This prior art forms the preamble of independent claim 1.
From EP-A-0165690 is known an automatic dispenser for powder detergent for washing
machines, including a plurality of powder hoppers which store powdered detergent, bleach,
softener and sour, and in which the detergent flows through valves to metering canisters so
as to meter predetermined amounts of products, which by pneumatic operated means are
then launched and conveyed to a flush bin where the products are mixed with water to form
a solution, which is subsequently carried toward the washing container within the washing 
machine.The present invention relates to an automatic powdered detergent metering and dispensing
system for washing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and metering system for washing machines, in
particular dishwashing and clothes washing machines, provided with a washing tank or tub

(681 ; 24) respectively comprising a reservoir (13) adapted to hold the powdered detergent
(11) and connected with said washing tank or tub through a conduit ( 80 ; 23) ; valve means

(76 ; 20) actuated by per se known actuation means (78; 32) and associated to said reservoir
(13) so as to enable the powdered detergent to be removed from the same reservoir and to be

conveyed into said washing tank or tub through said conduit (80 ; 23) ; and pneumatic generator
means (46, 14 ; 14) such as a fan unit, a blower, an air aspirator or the like, connected

through respective conduits (79, 74 ; 18) with said reservoir (13) so as to determine the
conveyance of the powdered detergent into said washing tank or tub (681; 24) when said

pneumatic generator means (14 ;14, 46) are operating, characterized in that said conduit (80;
23) is provided at its outlet end portion (81) connected to said tank or tub (681 ; 24) with at least a squeezing element (85),

adapted to prevent vapours and water splashes from passing into the same
conduit when the powdered detergent isn' t conveyed into said tank or tub (681 ; 24),

said squeezing element (85) co-operating with said end portion
(81), which is made of elastic material, and capable of being switched by

corresponding actuator means (87, 88) from a first to a second operational position, and vice
versa, in which it is respectively compressed against said end portion (81), thereby pressing

it temporarily flat and preventing the powdered detergent from passing through said conduit
(80), or is not compressed against said end portion (81) therefore enabling the powdered

detergent to pass through said conduit (80). 
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and
metering system according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said actuator means (88) comprise at least a sealed,
box (89) associated with said washing tank or tub (681)

and provided with at least an inner elastic
diaphragm (90) or the like, which is connected with said

squeezing element (85) and is arranged so as to divide
said box (89) into at least a first and a second almost

hermetically sealed inner chamber (91, 92), of which said
first inner chamber (91) is communicating with said

pneumatic generator means (14), while said second inner
chamber (92) is provided with elastic means (93) co-operating

with said diaphragm (90), said diaphragm (90)
being displaceable from a first to a second operational

position, against the action of said elastic means (93),
and vice-versa, when said first inner chamber (91) is not

supplied or is pneumatically supplied by said pneumatic
generator means (14), respectively, in the corresponding

first or second operational position of said actuator
means (88).
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and
metering system according to claim 1,


characterized in that
 said squeezing element (85) is
formed by a first and a second elongated stem (96, 97)

arranged close to each other and articulated inside said
washing tank or tub (681, 24), said stems (96, 97) being

provided at one of their ends with a respective 
orthogonally bent limb (99, 100) and being adapted to be

compressed or not compressed with their other end portion
against said end portion (81), said limbs (99, 100) being

joined to each other by elastic means (101) and co-operating
with corresponding inclined surfaces (102, 103)

of a recess (104) provided in a plate (105) attached to
said actuator means (87, 88), so that said stems (96, 97)

can be displaced from their compressing position to their
non-compressing position, against the action of said

elastic means (101), in the respective first or second
operational position of said actuator means (87, 88). 
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and metering system according to claim, the preceding claims, characterized
in that

said squeezing element (85) and said actuator means (87,88) can be connected through said conduit (80) with
a separate assembly (107) arranged outside the machine and formed by said detergent reservoir (13) and said pneumatic generator means (14).
Automatic powdered detergent dispensing and metering system according to claim 1, characterized
in that heating means (19) are associated to said pneumatic generator means (14)

for heating up the circulating air generated by these latter.
