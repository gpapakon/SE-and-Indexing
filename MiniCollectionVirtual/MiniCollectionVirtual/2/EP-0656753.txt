<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPREGNATED CASING AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME Cross Reference to Related ApplicationsThis invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application Serial No. 07/416,963 filed October 4, 1989, pending, which is a continuation-i - part application of U.S. Patent 4,959,232 and U.S. Patent 4,994,297 which is a divisional application of U.S. Patent 4,876,109.Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a casing impregnated with a high browning, low flavor liquid composition that imparts or adds a desirable brown, smoked color to an encased food. More particularly, the casing is impregnated with a liquid composition that browns an encased food but does not add a strong, smoked flavor to the food. A method of making impregnated casings is also within the scope of this invention.Background of the Invention Using liquid solutions (often referred to as liquid smoke) as a replacement for conventionally smoking foods by direct contact with wood smoke has become a standard industry practice. One known liquid smoke solution for flavoring and coloring foods is an aqueous liquid smoke flavoring described by Hollenbeck in U.S. Patent 3,106,473." Another useful solution for flavoring and coloring foods is obtained from a process for isolating the organic components of the fast pyrolysis of wood or cellulose described by Underwood et al. in U.S. Patent 4,876,108. When such liquid solutions are applied to the surface of meats and other 

 protein-containing foods, organic components in the solution give a food a characteristic smoke flavor and react with the proteins of the food to give a brown, smoked color typical of a conventionally smoked food. Surface appearance and flavor are important factors in the commercial and consumer acceptance of "liquid smoked" foods. A common feature of most varieties of such foods involves using various types of liquid solutions of wood-derived smoke constituents for imparting both characteristic flavor and color to the food.The application of a liquid smoke solution to a food is generally carried out in a variety of ways including: spraying or dipping a food during processing, incorporating the liquid smoke in the recipe itself, or treating a casing which contacts a food during processing. The conventional operations of spraying or dipping a casing have not been completely satisfactory due to an inability to treat or coat the encased food uniformly. In addition, treating a casing with a liquid smoke solution does not always provide a food having the desired
