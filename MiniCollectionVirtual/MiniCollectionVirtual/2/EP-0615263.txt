<ABSTRACT>
For the electrode of a vacuum circuit-breaker, a part of 
a high-conductive metal member is infiltrated in voids of a 

porous high-melting metal member, and both metal members are 
integrally joined to each other. An arc electrode portion 13 

is formed of a high-melting area in which the high-conductive 
metal is infiltrated in voids of the high-melting metal member. 

A coil electrode portion 14 is formed by hollowing the 
interior out of a high-conductive metal area, which is composed 

of only the high-conductive metal, and forming of slits 
(15...17) therein. A rod 18 is hard-brazed on the rear surface 

of the coil electrode portion 14. With this electrode, 
it is possible to reduce the number of parts and to omit the 

brazing portion between the arc electrode portion 13 and the 
coil electrode portion 14, thus lowering the electric resistance 

and the heat generated in operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum
circuit-breaker, an electrode for a vacuum
circuit-breaker, and a manufacturing method thereof.In general, a vacuum circuit-breaker for a
large current is so constructed that a pair of separable
electrodes are disposed in a vacuum vessel, and rods
connected to the rear surfaces of these electrodes
extend to the outside of the vacuum vessel. Each of a
pair of the above electrodes is composed of an arc
electrode portion on the front surface side and a coil
electrode portion on the rear surface side which are
opposed to each other. A current flows from one rod to
the other rod by way of the coil electrode portion and
the arc electrode portion of one electrode, and the arc
electrode portion and the coil electrode portion of the
other electrode. For breaking the current, any one of
the rods is moved by an operating device so as to
separate the arc electrode portion of one electrode from
the arc electrode portion of the other electrode. At 
this time, an arc is generated between both the arc
electrode portions. This arc is dispersed in the
filiform manner by magnetic field generated in the
axial direction, that is, in parallel to the arc by the
current flowing in the above coil electrode, to be
extinguished.Incidentally, for example, as disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. SHO 62-103928
(EP-A-0 208 271), the prior art electrode of this type
which is composed of the arc electrode portion and the
coil electrode portion is so constructed as follows:
Namely,at least the portion contacted with an arc in the
arc electrode portion is formed by the step of machining
such as cutting a metal member excellent in withstand
voltage performance and current-breaking performance,
for example, obtained by infiltration of a high
conductive metal such as copper in voids of a high
melting point metal such as chromium. Further, the coil
electrode portion is formed by the step of machining
such as cutting inclined or circumferential slits on the
side surface of a cylindrical member made from a high
conductive metal such as copper, wherein the above
slitted portion is adapted to allow a current to flow
therethrough in the circumferential direction. These
arc electrode portion and the coil electrode portion, 
and the coil electrode portion and the rod are
electrically and mechanically connected to each other by
hard brazing such as silver brazing, respectively.In the above prior art electrode, the arc
electrode portion, the coil electrode portion and the
rod are separately
