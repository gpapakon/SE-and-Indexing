<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an immunostimulatory agent comprising a peptide derived from lactoferrin having activity to modulate the release of inflammatory mediators from cells of the immune system. The peptide promotes the release of leukotriene B4 from polymorphonuclear neutrophils induced by activators such as the calcium ionophor A23187. It also promotes the release of histamine from mast cells induced by activators such as  alpha -toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus cells or the calcium ionophor A23187. The peptide is effective at low concentrations within the range of 1 to 100 ppm. By promoting the release of such inflammatory mediators the peptide can potentiate the cellular immune response and stimulate the host defense against infectious disease. This newly discovered immunostimulatory agent is useful as an active component of pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, clinical foods, etc., for prevention and treatment of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in humans and animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an immunostimulatory agent 
comprising a peptide derived from lactoferrin having activity to 
modulate the release of inflammatory mediators from cells of the 
immune system and thereby potentiate the cellular immune 
response. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
peptide derived from lactoferrin having at least the following 
activities: (1) promotes the release of leukotriene B4 from 
polymorphonuclear neutrophils; (2) promotes the release of 
histamine from mast cells. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mast cells play a 
major role in the host defense against bacterial, fungal and 
viral infections. Microorganisms or their products can interact 
directly with these cells and induce the release of inflammatory 
mediators such as leukotrienes and histamine which have multiple 
effects essential to amplification and control of the 
inflammatory response. Leukotriene B4 is a potent chemotactic 
and chemokinetic factor which attracts neutrophils, eosinophils, 
monocytes and macrophages to sites of infection and tissue  
 
trauma. It promotes the aggregation of neutrophils, augments 
their adherence to endothelial cells, stimulates the release of 
lysozomal enzymes and the production of superoxide. It also 
inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes via the induction of 
suppressor T cells and augments cytotoxic and natural killer 
cell activities. On the other hand, leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 
are the slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis which cause long-lasting 
contraction of smooth muscle, bronchoconstriction, 
vasoconstriction, secretion of mucous, and an increase in 
vascular permeability. Histamine induces vasodilation, increase 
in vascular permeability, stimulation of secretory glands and 
contraction of smooth muscle. Furthermore, histamine modulates 
certain immune effector functions such as cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity, lymphocyte proliferation, lymphokine production, 
and immunoglobulin synthesis. In general, the biological 
actions of leukotriene B4 and histamine tend to potentiate the 
cellular immune response and stimulate the host defense against 
microbial infections. It is widely recognized that the biological actions of 
leukotriene B4 relating to recruitment and stimulation of 
neutrophils are essential for the host defense against microbial 
infections. The migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils from 
circulating blood to the focus of infection is one of the 
earliest events of the inflammatory process. The cells leave
