<ABSTRACT>
A textile machine for processing a filament 
yarn (12) and comprising a feed system (18) for advancing a yarn 

along an operative path of travel and into a treatment 
zone. A yarn accumulator (1) in the form of a deflecting 

plate (3) is positioned downstream of the feed system for 
temporarily storing the yarn upon a yarn break or 

slackening of the yarn, with the plate being positioned 
generally transverse to the operative path of travel 

and with one of the side edges thereof being closely 
adjacent the path of travel. Also, a yarn guide is 

positioned on the side of the yarn path of travel 
opposite from the one side edge of the plate, such that 

in normal operation the operative yarn path of travel 
runs between the one side edge of the deflecting plate 

and the yarn guide. Upon a yarn break or the 
development of slack in the advancing yarn, the yarn 

impacts against the deflecting plate (3) and forms an 

accumulation of the yarn. The plate may be coated with 
an adhesive to adhere the accumulation thereto, or the 

accumulation may drop from the plate and fall into an 
underlying collection bin (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
An apparatus for processing a filament yarn according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-526 635.The present invention relates to a textile
machine for processing a filament yarn, wherein the
yarn is advanced by a feed system into a treatment zone
and withdrawn from the treatment zone by means of an
extraction system, and wherein a yarn accumulator is
arranged downstream of the feed system for temporarily
storing the yarn in the event of a yarn break or other
irregularity in the advance of the yarn.A machine of the described type is known, for
example, from DE-OS 22 54 736. In a machine of this
type, it is necessary to withdraw the yarn from its
production or processing zone always at a higher speed
than it is supplied thereto. With this type of yarn
delivery, irregularities often occur in the yarn
delivery. These irregularities may be caused by the
yarn production method itself, or they may be caused by
a disturbance in the subsequent steps of the process.
Such irregularities in the yarn delivery can easily
result in breakdowns of the process, such as by having
the yarn become entangled, or by the yarn forming laps.
The problem of lap formation is of very great
importance in the operation of textile machinery,
inasmuch as laps can damage a textile machine. Such a
formation of laps may occur, even when there are only
short-time irregularities in the yarn delivery, which 
can develop, for example, in the takeup zone of the
textile machine, especially when it is necessary to
transfer the continuously advancing yarn from a fully
would package to an empty tube.The known apparatus also has the disadvantage
that it requires an adequately strong source of
compressed air, and must either be in operation
continuously, or be shut down, when breakdowns occur.
By the time the apparatus becomes operative, it may
however be already too late to avoid the above noted
problems.As a further disadvantage, it is recognized
that upon yarn breaks occurring downstream of the feed
system, the dropping yarn end may become entangled, or
be wound in other feed systems, or it may wrap about
other rotating elements of the processing station for
that yarn or adjacent processing stations. Also, if
worst comes to worst, the dropping yarn end may even
damage the machine elements. Finally, it is very
difficult to subsequently remove the yarn residues.It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to provide an apparatus for temporarily
accumulating a quantity of yarn resulting from the
slackening or breakage of the yarn
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for processing a filament
yarn (12) and comprising


yarn feed means (18, 46) for advancing the yarn
along an operative path of travel and to a treatment

zone, and
a yarn accumulator (1) positioned
immediately downstream of said yarn feed means (18, 46) for

temporarily storing the yarn upon a yarn break or the
like, said yarn accumulator (1) comprising a deflecting

plate (3) having opposite side edges (5, 6), with said plate being
mounted generally transverse to the operative path of

travel and with one of said side edges (5) being adjacent
the operative path of travel, and such that the

advancing yarn is not significantly deflected by the
plate (3) when advancing along the operative path of travel

but the advancing yarn does engage the plate upon a
yarn break or the like, characterized in that
said yarn accumulator (1) further comprises a yarn
guide (2) disposed on the side of said operative yarn path

of travel opposite from said one side edge of said
plate, and such that the operative yarn path of travel

runs between said one side edge of said plate and said
yarn guide.
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said plate (3) is angled along an apex line (7) to

define two plate segments (8, 9) which are inclined with

respect to each other, and with the apex line (7) extending
toward said yarn guide when viewed in the direction of

the yarn advance. 
The apparatus as defined in Claim 2
wherein the deflecting plate (3) is coated with an adhesive

material on the side thereof facing said yarn feed
means (18, 46).
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
further comprising a yarn collection bin (26) positioned

below said deflecting plate (3) so as to be adapted to
receive the yarn after the yarn engages the deflecting

plate.
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said one side edge (5) of said plate (3) is spaced from

the operative yarn path of travel and such that the
advancing yarn is not deflected by the plate when

advancing along the operative path of travel.
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said yarn feed means (18, 46) defines a natural yarn

delivery path along which the yarn is advanced in the
absence of guidance downstream of the feed means, and

wherein said deflecting plate (3) is positioned so as to
intersect the natural yarn delivery path.
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said yarn feed means (46) comprises a driven feed

roll (46.1) and a cooperating pressure roll (46.2) which engages the
feed roll so as to define a common tangent, and wherein

said deflecting plate (3) is positioned along the common
tangent of said rolls.
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said treatment zone comprises yarn false

twisting means comprising, in serial arrangement, an
elongate heater (20), an elongate cooling plate (24), a false

twisting unit (28), and a second yarn feeding means (30). 
The apparatus as defined in Claim 1
wherein said treatment zone comprises a yarn winding

apparatus (54) for winding the advancing yarn into a cross
wound package (50).
