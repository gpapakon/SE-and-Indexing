<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cycloolefin resin 
pellets comprising cycloolefin resin pellets and a coating 
material adhered onto the surface of the pellets, and a 
process for producing a molded product thereof. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to cycloolefin 
resin pellets making it possible to reduce the amount of 
impurities, such as gelatinous contaminants and burns, 
which are adversely affected to the transparency of a 
molded product when producing by melting the pellets of a 
cycloolefin random copolymer of ethylene and a specific 
cycloolefin, a ring-opening (co)polymer of the specific 
cycloolefin and a hydrogenation product of the ring-opening 
(co)polymer; and a process for producing a molded product 
thereof. The present inventors have proposed a variety of 
cycloolefin random copolymers of ethylene and a specific 
cycloolefin, as described in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication No. 168708/1985 and specifications of 
Japanese Patent Applications No. 220550/1984, No. 
236828/1984, No. 236829/1984 and No. 242336/1984. The  
 
cycloolefin random copolymers described in those 
specifications have excellent transparency and are 
excellent in various properties such as heat resistance, 
thermal aging resistance, chemical resistance, solvent 
resistance, dielectric properties and mechanical 
properties. Further, such cycloolefin random copolymers 
have good adhesion to substrates of various materials. 
Accordingly, the cycloolefin random copolymers can be used, 
for example, in a field of optical materials such as 
optical memory discs and optical fibers, and a field of 
transparent container materials and packaging materials 
such as transparent films and transparent containers. 
Moreover, since the ring-opening (co)polymer of the above-described 
cycloolefin and the hydrogenation product thereof 
have similar properties to the cycloolefin random 
copolymer, these have been used for the same application 
field. In general, such cycloolefin resins are pelletized 
immediately after the copolymerization, and the resultant 
pellets are melted to form a molded product, such as films, 
sheets and injection molded products. However, when a variety of molded products are formed 
from these cycloolefin resin pellets, the transparency is 
sometimes reduced due to the production conditions. The present inventors have studied about the reason 
for undesirably reducing the transparency, and as a result, 
they have found that the reduction of the transparency is  
 
caused
