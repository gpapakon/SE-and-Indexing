<ABSTRACT>
A system for collecting within a mobile subscriber 
station (102) of a cellular radio system the key 

elements of telephone billing information for 
subsequent retrieval. Information about the connected 

party's number (11), the time of the call (12) and the 
duration of the call (13) are collected in real time and 

stored in a non-volatile memory. Such information is 
selectively retrieved from the memory of the subscriber 

station on command (63) and a bill for use of the 
subscriber station calculated on the spot (by a mobile 

station rental agency, for example).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to subscriber stations for 
use in radio telecommunications networks and, more 
particularly, to a system for the logging of calls 
within such subscriber stations. Cellular radio communications is, perhaps, the 
fastest growing field in the world-wide 
telecommunications industry. The convenience of 
subscriber mobility and the ability to place and 
receive telephone calls regardless of where the 
subscriber's telephone instrument is located has 
introduced a new era. The convenience of 
telecommunications without the restrictions of a 
physical telephone cable limiting the mobility of the 
telephone instrument is a great advantage. Mobile 
radio telecommunications may be implemented using 
different technologies including land mobile radio 
technologies, cellular radio, and personal 
communication systems (PCS). Hereinafter, the 
reference to cellular radio telecommunications systems 
will be intended to include each of these other 
telecommunication systems which employ portable 
subscriber stations. In such systems, the geographic 
range within which the subscriber station may move is 
determined strictly by the radio coverage area of one 
or more radio base stations with which the subscriber 
station can communicate. The convenience of mobility of subscriber stations 
within the cellular radio network has facilitated new 
business opportunities in the field of the short term 
rental of portable cellular subscriber stations. Such 
businesses rent to a customer for the limited period of  
 
a day, a few days, a week or similar short term periods 
a complete portable subscriber station having cellular 
radio telecommunication service already established and 
an existing phone number and which is ready to use. 
Such rentals are often combined with the rental of 
automobiles so that mobile communications is available 
to a traveller using a rental car in a city away from 
his home. In most cases, the rental period for which such 
cellular subscriber stations are rented are 
considerably shorter than the normal billing interval 
established by the operator of the cellular system. 
Thus, there arises a problem of knowing how to charge 
and what amount to charge to the renter of a cellular 
subscriber station since it's impossible for the rental 
company to know what calls to what locations and what 
charges have been incurred by the renter during the 
period of the rental contract. One way in which this 
is handled today is by requiring the renter to 
establish a credit card account
