<ABSTRACT>
Certain substituted hexahydroarylquinoli­
zines and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 

are peripherally selective α₂-adrenoceptor 
antagonists. The compounds are adapted to be 

employed for the treatment of certain pathological 
disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, disorders 

involving platelet aggregation and the like without 
side effects attributable to effect on the central 

nervous system.

<DESCRIPTION>
Peripheral α ₂-adrenoceptors are 
associated with a variety of important physiological 
effects. Vascular α ₂-adrenoceptors when 
stimulated mediate vasoconstriction which gives rise 
to hypertension. Pancreatic α ₂-adrenoceptors 
modulate release of insulin. Platelet α ₂-adrenoceptors 
when activated cause platelet aggregation. 
Other α ₂-adrenoceptors affect gastrointestinal 
motility and fat cell metabolism. Molecules which 
selectively antagonize these peripheral α ₂-adreno 
ceptors offer a novel approach to the treatment of 
pathological conditions such as hypertension, 
diabetes, obesity, and disorders involving platelet 
aggregation and gastrointestinal motility. α-Adrenoceptors are located also in the 
central nervous system and mediate a variety of other 
physiological effects such as respiratory stimulation, 
psychomotor activity, increase in wakefulness and 
reduction in appetite.  
 Various compounds have been reported which 
affect α₂-adrenoceptor activity. Thus, for 
example, certain benzoquinolizines have been reported 
in UK patent applications 1435573, 2106909 and 
2136804 to possess α₂-adrenoceptor antagonistic 
activity. Generally, however, the α₂-adrenoceptor 
antagonistic activity shown by most of the known 
compounds are non-selective, i.e., the compounds have 
a mediating effect on both central and peripheral 
α-antagonistic activity. According to the present invention it has 
been discovered that certain substituted hexahydroarylquinolizines 
are selective peripheral α₂-adrenoceptor 
antagonists, i.e., they have α₂-adrenoceptor 
blocking activity but are further characterized 
by tending not to penetrate the blood brain barrier. 
Thus, the novel compounds are adapted to be employed 
in the treatment of conditions where selective 
antagonisms of peripheral α₂-adrenoceptors is 
desirable, such as antihypertensives, antidiabetic 
agents, anti-obesity agents, platelet aggregation 
inhibitors, modifiers of gastrointestinal motility 
and the like. The invention also relates to methods 
for antagonizing peripheral α₂-adrenoceptors and 
to compositions for carrying out the methods. This invention is concerned with a 
hexahydroarylquinolizine compound of the formula:  
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein 
Ar isan aromatic ring system selected from 
  
 
wherein R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, 
halo, hydroxy, C1-3 alkoxy or lower alkyl, 
carboxy, or together are methylenedioxy or 
C3-4 alkylene; and 
wherein the free bonds of Ar may be attached to the 
quinolizine
