<CLAIMS>
Emulsion polymers based on acrylates for treating 
flexible surfaces, characterised in that the emulsion 

polymers EMP are graft products of graft monomers of 
formula I 


 
wherein R
1
 is an alkyl group having 2 to 24 carbon 
atoms, on a base polymer BP which is synthesised, in an 

amount of 55 to 100 wt.%, from monomers of formula II 

 
wherein R
2
 is an alkyl group having 2 to 24 carbon 
atoms, with the proviso that the ratio of the base 

polymer BP to the graft monomers of formula I is 9 to 1 
to 1 to 1 parts by weight. 
A process for treating flexible surfaces, 
characterised in that the emulsion polymers based on 

acrylates according to Claim 1 are applied to the 
surface. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the emulsion polymers based on acrylates are used 

for the finishing of leather.
