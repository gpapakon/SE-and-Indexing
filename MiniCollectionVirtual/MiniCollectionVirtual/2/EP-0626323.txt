<ABSTRACT>
A motor-driven refuse-collecting vehicle (dust-cart) (1) for receiving refuse sacks and/or rubbish emptied out of refuse containers has a large container (6) and a dumping unit (8) which is arranged between the large container and the driver's cab (3) and from which a sliding device transfers the rubbish through a closable opening into the large container. In order to fit out the refuse-collecting vehicle in particular for taking away recyclable rubbish, the dumping unit comprises a receiving area which has at least one lateral dumping opening which is delimited towards the bottom by a lateral wall (10), the top edge of which lies approximately in the central region of the door of the driver's cab.

Motor-driven refuse collecting vehicle (1) for 
receiving sacks of waste material and/or waste materials 

emptied out of refuse bins, preferably recyclable waste 

materials, having a container (6), and having a tipping 
unit (8) which is arranged between the container (6) and 

the driver's cab (3) and consists of a receiving compartment 
(9) which has at least one lateral tipping-in 

opening which is bounded at the bottom by a lateral wall 
(10) whose upper edge (11) lies approximately in the 

middle region of the door of the driver's cab (3), and 
from which receiving compartment a slide (20), which can 

be moved back and forth in the longitudinal direction of 
the vehicle, conveys the waste materials through a 

closable opening (25) into the container; characterized 
in that an intermediate bottom of the receiving compartment 

(9) comprises a grate (14) of parallel bars or tubes 
which run in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle 

and which are penetrated by the prongs (20) of the slide 
which is of rake-like design. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the grate (14) rises in a sloping 

or curving manner towards the driver's cab. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the essentially horizontal 

section (15) of the grate (14) is provided, on its side 
opposite the driver's cab, with a section having an 

upwardly directed bow curvature. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, in the extended 

position, the prongs (20) of the slide lie below the  
 

rising section (16) of the grate (14) in the region of 
the terminating wall of the driver's cab (3). 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, during its movement 

in the direction of the driver's cab (3), the slide is 
folded into an essentially horizontal plane in which it 

also lies below the bars of the grate (14) in the region 
of the horizontal section (15) thereof. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the prongs of the 

slide are pivoted out of their approximately horizontal 
position (20'') into an approximately vertical position 

(20') in the region of their point of reversal on the 
driver's cab side. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the point of 

reversal of the rake-like slide (20) on the driver's cab 
side lies below the rising section (16) of the grate 

(14). 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the slide (20) is 

mounted on a carriage (17) which can be moved in guides. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the prongs (20) of 

the slide are attached to a shaft (19) which is mounted 
on the carriage and bears a lever (22) in the manner of 

a crank, to which lever the piston rod of a pressure 
medium piston-cylinder unit which moves the carriage (17) 

back and forth is linked in such a way that the said 
piston rod pivots the slide into an approximately horizontal 

position during the pushing-back movement in the 
direction of the driver's cab (3) and into an approximately 

vertical position during the retraction movement. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the carriage (17) is provided with 

a coupling piece (30) which, in the end region of the 
pushing-back movement, comes into coupling engagement 

with a counter-coupling piece (31) in the region of the 
rear wall of the driver's cab, and in that the coupling  

 
of the two coupling pieces is released by the pivoting 

movement of at least one prong (20) of the row of prongs 
into an approximately perpendicular position relative to 

the carriage guide. 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that the coupling comprises a pin (30) 

arranged on the carriage (17) and a pawl (31) which is 
fixed to the frame and is provided with an extended beak 

(32) or the like which is arranged in such a way that, in 
the end region of its uprighting movement, a prong (20) 

lifts the said beak out of its locking engagement with 
the pin (30). 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 8 to 11, characterized in that the carriage (17) 

bears brushes on its underside, which brush over the 
bottom (13) of the receiving compartment (9). 
Refuse collecting vehicle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the container is 

provided with a bottom which rises towards the rear.
