<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
modifying the surfaces of the molded materials made of 

fluorine resins comprising irradiating an ultraviolet 
laser beam on said surfaces in the presence of an 

ultraviolet-absorbing compound and a fluorosurfactant. 
According to the process, the adhesive and wetting 

properties and the like of the surfaces of the molded 
materials made of fluorine resins can be remarkably 

improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
process for modifying the chemically inactive surfaces of
the molded materials made of fluorine resins which
increases the adhesive and wetting properties of said
surfaces.Fluorine resins are fit for various uses
because they have superior properties (e.g. oil and water
repellency, sliding property, stain resistance, heat
resistance, chemical resistance and electrical
properties) in comparison with other resins. However the
fluorine resins have disadvantages that it is difficult
to apply adhesives, coatings and the like to the fluorine
resins or to laminate the fluorine resins with other
materials, said disadvantages being attributable to the
inactive surface of the fluorine resins.Various processes for modifying the surfaces of
the fluorine resins have hitherto been proposed. For
example, E. R. Nelson et. al. (Ind. Eng. Chem., vol. 50,
1958, pp. 329-330) describe the use of a complex solution
prepared from a tetrahydrofuran solution of metallic
sodium and naphthalene. In this technique, not only it 
causes trouble from the viewpoint of working hygiene
because the complex solution is unstable and liable to
cause ignition during the treatment of the fluorine
resins, but also adhesive and wetting properties and the
like of the modified surfaces of the fluorine resins
decrease remarkably under the condition of sunlight
exposure or high temperature.Tsunoda et. al. [KogyoZairyo (Engineering
Materials), vol. 29 (No. 2), 1981, p. 105) describe the
use of a glow discharge. In this technique, a
modification effect of the surfaces of the fluorine
resins is remarkably inferior to that of nonfluorine
resins such as polyethylene and the like.Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No.
22108/1978 describes the use of a high frequency sputter
etching under low pressure. In this method, there are
several disadvantages that (i) a treating speed is slow,
(ii) resinous residues formed during the sputter etching
are deposited to inner parts of an expensive, large-sized
treating apparatus with a vacuum system, and (iii) an
abrasionable, irregular surfaces of the fluorine resins
do not bring about sufficient adhesive properties and
application properties of coatings for low fluidable
adhesives, coatings and the like.Japanese Patent Publication(KOKAI) No.
196834/1990 describes the use of laser beam in a special
gaseous atmosphere such as B(CH3)3 and Al(CH3)3. 
According to this method, a treating speed is slow, and a
strong poisonous gas and an expensive, large-sized
treating
