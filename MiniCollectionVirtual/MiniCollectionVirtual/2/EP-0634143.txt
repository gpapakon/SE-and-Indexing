<ABSTRACT>
A tube knot applicator (10) for use in endosurgical 
procedures. The tube knot applicator (10) has an elongated 

tube member (20) having a distal end and a proximal end, as 
well as an axial passage therethrough. The tube member (20) 

has slits (55) for partially collapsing the distal end of the 
tube as well as a removable plug (50) mounted in the distal end 

of the tube to prevent the distal end of the tube from 
collapsing by supporting distal slitted end. A suture (150) 

having at least one slip knot and at least one locking 
knot is mounted in the tube knot applicator (10) with the knot 

tied about the collapsing means. A sleeve (60) is mounted to 
the distal end of tube knot applicator (10) over the suture 

knot and the distal end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention relates is 
endoscopic surgical instruments, in particular, endoscopic 
suturing devices. Endoscopic surgical (endosurgical) procedures are 
receiving wide acceptance in the medical community, as 
well as among the patient population. The term endoscopic 
as used herein is meant to refer to minimally invasive 
surgical techniques, including endoscopy, laparoscopy, 
thoracoscopy, and arthroscopy. The advantages of 
endoscopic surgical techniques include reduced post-operative 
recuperation period, reduced hospital stay, 
decreased pain, decreased scarring, and a decrease in the 
length of the operative procedure. Endoscopic surgical techniques are typically 
performed by inserting conventional trocars into a 
patient's body cavity in order to access a particular 
surgical site, e.g., the gall bladder. Conventional 
trocars typically consist of an elongated obturator having 
a piercing point which is concentrically mounted in a 
conventional trocar cannula. Conventional trocar cannulas 
typically consist of an elongated hollow tube mounted in 
a hollow handle. The trocars are inserted into the body  
 
cavity and positioned proximate to the surgical site. 
Then, the trocar obturators are removed, leaving the 
trocar cannulas as pathways to the body cavity. A 
conventional endoscope is typically inserted into one of 
the trocar cannulas. The remaining trocar cannulas are 
used as pathways to and from the body cavity for 
instruments and the like. Numerous endoscopic instruments have been developed 
for use in endoscopic procedures, including surgical 
staplers, cutters, graspers, manipulators and the like. 
In addition, endoscopic suturing devices have been 
developed and are available for the surgeon. One type of 
conventional endoscopic suturing device typically consists 
of an elongated cannula, having an internal axial passage. 
A suture is typically threaded through the axial passage 
and extends through and out of the distal end of the 
cannula. A conventional surgical needle is typically 
mounted to the end of the distally extending suture. 
Typically, a pre-tied loop and knot have been emplaced in 
the distally extending section of the suture. The cannula 
is typically inserted through a trocar site and the needle 
and suture are then manipulated using endoscopic needle 
holders and graspers. Although conventional endoscopic 
suturing devices are available there may be disadvantages 
associated with their use. For example, two additional 
trocar cannulas (in
