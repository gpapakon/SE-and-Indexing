<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method for cloning 
and producing the 
Bgl
II endonuclease by: 1) introducing the 
restriction endonuclease gene from 
Bacillus globigii
 into a host 
whereby the restriction gene is expressed; 2) fermenting the 

host which contains the plasmid encoding and expressing the 

Bgl
II restriction endonuclease activity; and 3) purifying the 

Bgl
II restriction endonuclease from the fermented host which 
cont
ains the plasmid encoding and expressing the 
Bgl
II 
restriction endonuclease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recombinant DNA which
encodes the BglII restriction endonuclease and modification
methylase, and the production of these enzymes from cells
containing the recombinant DNA.Restriction endonucleases are now one of the foremost tools
of molecular biology. They occur naturally in a wide variety of
bacteria, both eubacteria and archaebacteria (Roberts and
Macelis, Nucl. Acids Res. 20: 2167-2180, (1992)), and when
purified, can be used to cut DNA in a sequence-specific manner
into precise fragments. By use of the large number of restriction
enzymes now available commercially, DNA molecules can be
uniquely identified and fractionated into component genes.Restriction endonucleases are a component of restriction-modification
(RM) systems, which have been extensively studied
for over forty years (Luria and Human, J. Bacteriol. 64: 557-569,
(1952); Bertani and Weigle, J. Bacteriol. 65: 113-121, (1953)).
The systems usually contain a second component, the
modification methylase (Arber and Linn, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 38:
467-500, (1969); Boyer, Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 25: 153-176,
(1971)). It is thought that in nature RM systems act as
"bacterial immune systems" that destroy foreign DNA entering
cells (Smith, PAABS REVISTA 5: 313-318, (1976)). However,
individual bacteria have been known to contain as many as
seven different RM systems and this apparent redundancy
suggests that these systems serve other functions as well (Stein
et al., J. Bacteriol. 174: 4899-4906, (1992)).In the bacterium, the restriction endonuclease scans
incoming DNA for a specific recognition sequence and produces 
double stranded scissions in the DNA molecule (Meselson, Ann.
Rev. Biochem. 41: 447-466, (1972)). The modification methylase
acts to protect the bacterium's own DNA against the action of its
restriction counterpart. The methylase recognizes and binds the
same DNA sequence as its corresponding endonuclease; however,
instead of cleaving, it methylates a specific residue within the
recognition sequence, thereby preventing endonucleolytic
binding or cleavage (Smith, Science 205: 455-462, (1979)). In
this manner, the bacterial host DNA is rendered completely
resistant to cleavage by the restriction endonucleases within the
cell.Initially the term "RM system" was applied only to systems
in which the components had been genetically defined. However,
the term has now come to refer to any site-specific endonuclease
isolated from a bacterium. In many cases the existence of a
modification methylase component is
