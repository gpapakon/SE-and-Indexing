<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (102) is adapted to detect the linear extension (position), velocity and acceleration of a hydraulic cylinder (108). The hydraulic cylinder (108) defines a variable lenght coaxial resonant cavity (112). Under the control of a controller (228), an RF transmitting section (114) and an RF receiving section (116) are used to determine the resonant frequency of the cavity. The resonant frequency of the cavity (112) is determined by comparing a received signal with a threshold and detecting slope intercept conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
apparatus and a method for determining the position of 
a piston and piston rod within a housing and, more 
particularly, to an apparatus and a method for 
determining the piston's position using radio 
frequency (RF) signals. In the field of hydraulic cylinders, a 
variety of systems have been proposed in which the 
displacement of the elements of the cylinder is 
electrically sensed and displayed or used to perform 
control functions. Conventional transducers have 
serious deficiencies, owing in part to difficulties in 
mounting the units and the harsh environmental 
conditions to which they are exposed. Transducers 
used on hydraulic systems in the heavy equipment 
industry are particularly subject to damage from the 
severe work environment. Hydraulic cylinders are 
typically located in relatively unprotected areas and 
are subject to, for example, high g-forces, wide 
temperature variations, dust, water, debris, etc., 
which can result in both electrical and mechanical 
failure. One attempt to provide a sensor which is 
particularly suitable for the heavy equipment industry 
uses radio frequency (RF) signals. One such system is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,737,705 issued 
April 12, 1988 to Bitar, et al. Bitar transmits a 
ramping RF signal into a coaxial resonant cavity  
 
formed by the hydraulic cylinder. When the 
cylinder's resonant frequency is transmitted, the 
signal detected by a receiving antenna reaches a peak. 
The resonant frequency has a one to one relationship 
with the cylinder's extension. Thus, by determining 
the cylinder's resonant frequency, the cylinder's 
linear extension can be determined. The peak of the received signal is detected 
through comparison with a threshold value. The 
resonant frequency is determined by modifying the 
measured frequency of the transmitted signal to adjust 
for the difference between the threshold and the 
actual peak. This adjustment adds error into the 
position determination since the difference between 
the transmitted signal and the actual resonant 
frequency varies with the resonant frequency, the 
accuracy of the threshold value, and the size and 
shape of the cylinder. The frequency of the transmitted signal is 
measured by determining the period of a number of 
cycles of the transmitted signal. When the threshold 
is reached, Bitar keeps the frequency constant. This 
also adds error since the extension of the cylinder 
may be changing, thereby also changing the resonant 
frequency of the cavity.
