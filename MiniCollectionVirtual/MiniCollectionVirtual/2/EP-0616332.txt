<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the number of depleted cells (21) and 
the errors caused thereby, the memory array (20) 

comprises a number of groups of control transistors (23) 
relative to respective groups (22) of memory cells. The 

control transistors (23) of each group are NMOS 
transistors having the drain terminal connected to its 

own control line (BLP), and each of the control 
transistors of one group is relative to a row portion of 

the memory array (20): More specifically, each control 
transistor (23) presents the control gate connected to 

the respective word line (WL), and the source region 
connected to the source region of the cells (21) in the 

same row and in the same group (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
flash-EEPROM memory array and to a method of biasing such flash-EEPROM memory array.Flash-EEPROM memories are known to consist of an
array including a number of cells arranged in rows and
columns and connected to circuitry enabling them to be
written (programmed), read and erased electronically,
extremely rapidly, and with high density integration.Flash-EEPROM memory cells are similar to those of
EEPROMs, except that they present a very thin gate oxide
layer (between the substrate and floating gate region).Though highly promising at present, due to the
above characteristics - electric erasability and high
density - flash-EEPROM memories continue to present
several drawbacks limiting their use.One of the main drawbacks of this type of memory
is due to dispersion of the threshold value of the
erased cells (i.e. the voltage to be applied between the
control gate and source regions for turning the cell
on). Such dispersion, representable by a bell-shaped
curve centered about a mean value, is due to the erase 
process employed, which consists in applying a high
voltage to the source regions of the cells for
extracting electrons from the floating gate (unlike
EEPROM memories wherein erasure is effected by
ultraviolet radiation). The outcome of electronically
erasing the cells as described above depends on various
factors: channel length (which may vary from one cell to
another due to misalignment of fabrication masks or
other technical problems); the erase voltage applied to
each cell (the source regions of flash-EEPROM cells are
formed in a single diffusion, which is connected by
contacts and at regular intervals to a metal source
line; due to the series resistance of the N+ type
diffusion, however, the erase voltage of the cells
furthest from the contacts differs from and is lower
than that of the closer cells); threshold voltage
reached after programming (also variable); and weak
erasure phenomena.Another drawback typical of flash-EEPROM memories
is the possibility of read errors, due to the presence
of overerased cells and the absence of selection
transistors for each cell as on EEPROM memories.A memory array of the type defined in the preamble of claim
1 is disclosed in WO-A-8 906 429, wherein the source
regions of the control transistors are all connected
together and the array is biased in a conventional way. The
presence of source regions spanning the entire width of the
memory rows involves noise in the memory operation;
standard biasing does not exclude
