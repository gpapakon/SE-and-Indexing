<ABSTRACT>
The device contains a body (1 to 3) forming a gap having a pullback detent (8), in which a weft-thread end introduced in a direction transverse to its longitudinal extension and fixed is held in zig-zag form. The device is arranged in such a way that the gap having the pullback detent (8) extends in the warp direction, in order to receive a weft end, and cooperates with a selvedge-laying needle (31) which pulls out the weft-thread end (36) in the weft direction counter to the holding force generated by a frictional resistance and which inserts it into the open shed. After the weft thread has been beaten up by the reed, the weft-thread end (36) is held by the zig-zag-shaped receptacle and is transferred under constant conditions to the selvedge-laying needle, in order to produce a uniform insertion edge.
