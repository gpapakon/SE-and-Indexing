<ABSTRACT>
Reclaim rubber is obtained from vulcanized rubber 
by subjecting a mass of the rubber to mechanical working 

applying highly intensive mechanical forces to the mass. 
The process is relatively energy efficient and therefore 

produces reclaim rubber at relatively low cost. It also 
mitigates the objectionable smell associated with known 

reclaim rubber products.

<DESCRIPTION>
There have been prior attempts at treating cured 
(vulcanized) rubber scrap material to break it down in some 
manner to effectively regenerate it, and thereby provide a 
rubber material which can be recompounded, and subsequently 
molded and cured. The result of this process is a material 
usually known as reclaim rubber. Known processes generally comprise the following: 
a) swelling the rubber with oils and then 
treating with chemicals such as caustic 
soda, and steam distilling the mixture; b) attacking the rubber as above, and then 
treating in a autoclave; and c) applying specific wavelengths of micro-wave 
or radio-frequency radiation for lengthy 
periods of time. These processes are not as energy-efficient as is 
desirable and costs of producing reclaim rubber by these 
processes are high. Moreover, with the known processes the 
reclaim rubber has an objectionable smell associated with 
it. Applicants have now found a process whereby 
reclaim rubber can be produced relatively inexpensively and 
which mitigates the objectionable smell characteristic of 
known reclaim rubbers. Applicants have found that when a mass preferably 
consisting substantially wholly of finely divided 
vulcanized rubber compound is subjected to high intensity 
mechanical forces, for example shearing forces, the rubber 
becomes substantially regenerated to the point that it can 
be effectively re-vulcanized. This process can be  
 
conducted rapidly, is highly efficient, and produces 
reclaim rubber at considerably less cost than the known 
processes. Moreover, the product is free from or has the 
above-mentioned objectionable smell associated with it to a 
lesser extent. Various procedures and forms of apparatus may be 
used in carrying out the present process. Those skilled in 
the art of mixing, compounding and blending rubbers, 
elastomers and plastics are familiar with various forms of 
mixing, compounding and blending equipment capable of 
inducing high intensity shearing or other mechanical forces 
in a plastic mass and all such equipment may be used in 
carrying out the process of the invention. Examples of 
such equipment include BANBURY® mixers available from 
Farrell Corporation, Ansonia, Connecticut, FARRELL® 
continuous mixers, also available from Farrell Corporation, 
GELIMAT® mixer/compounders available from Draiswerke Inc., 
Allendale, New Jersey, similar equipment available from 
other manufacturers, and twin screw extruders. Such 
equipment may be operated in batch or continuous fashion. The manner or

<CLAIMS>
A process for regeneration of rubber comprising 
subjecting a mass comprising vulcanized rubber in finely 

divided form to mechanical working that applies high 
intensity mechanical forces to said mass and sufficient to 

substantially regenerate said rubber without substantially 
degrading said rubber such that a vulcanizable rubber mass 

is formed exhibiting on curing a tensile strength at least 
35% that of similarly cured virgin rubber compound. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein said 
tensile strength is at least 45%, preferably at least 55% 

that of similarly cured virgin rubber compound. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said 
high intensity forces dissipate energy in said mass at a 

rate of from 1,000 to 145,000, preferably 4,000 to 35,000 
watts per 100 g of the weight of said mass. 
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
said rubber is tire crumb, preferably passenger car or 

heavy service tire crumb. 
A process according to any preceding claim 
wherein said rubber has a particle size 4 to 200, 

preferably 6 to 60 mesh. 
A process according to any preceding claim 
wherein said high intensity forces raise the temperature of 

said mass at a rate of 5°C/sec to 60°C/sec, preferably 
10°C/sec to 50°C/sec. 
A process according to any preceding claim 
wherein the step of subjecting said mass to mechanical 

working comprises processing said mass in a rotary mixer 
having a stationary chamber holding said mass and at least 

one mixer member rotating in said chamber. 
A process according to claim 7 wherein said mixer 
member comprises generally radially extending mixing 

elements rotating about an axis, and provides a shearing 
rate of 50 to 250 reciprocal seconds, preferably 75 to 200 

reciprocal seconds. 
A process according to any preceding claim 
wherein said mass is subjected to mechanical working in the 

presence of or in the absence of a vulcanization inhibitor.
