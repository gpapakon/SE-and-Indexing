<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the read and write errors caused by 
depleted memory array cells being turned on even when 

not selected, the nonselected memory cells are so biased 
as to present a floating terminal and a terminal at a 

positive voltage with respect to the substrate region. 
In this way, the threshold voltage of the above cells 

(the minimum voltage between the gate and source 
terminals for the cell to be turned on) increases due to 

the "body effect", whereby the threshold voltage 
depends, among other things, on the voltage drop between 

the cell terminal operating as the source and the 
substrate, and increases alongside an increase in the 

voltage drop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
biasing a nonvolatile flash-EEPROM memory array.Flash-EEPROM memories are known to consist of an
array including a number of cells arranged in rows and
columns and connected to circuitry enabling them to be
written (programmed), read and erased electronically,
extremely rapidly, and with high density integration.Flash-EEPROM memory cells are similar to those of
EEPROMs, except that they present a very thin gate oxide
layer (between the substrate and floating gate region).Though highly promising at present, due to the
above characteristics - electric erasability and high
density - flash-EEPROM memories continue to present
several drawbacks limiting their use.One of the main drawbacks of this type of memory
is due to dispersion of the threshold value of the
erased cells (i.e. the voltage to be applied between the
control gate and source regions for turning the cell
on). Such dispersion, representable by a bell-shaped 
curve centered about a mean value, is due to the erase
process employed, which consists in applying a high
voltage to the source regions of the cells for
extracting electrons from the floating gate (unlike
EEPROM memories wherein erasure is effected by
ultraviolet radiation). The outcome of electronically
erasing the cells as described above depends on various
factors: channel length (which may vary from one cell to
another due to misalignment of fabrication masks or
other technical problems); the erase voltage applied to
each cell (the source regions of flash-EEPROM cells are
formed in a single diffusion, which is connected by
contacts and at regular intervals to a metal source
line; due to the series resistance of the N+ type
diffusion, however, the erase voltage of the cells
furthest from the contacts differs from and is lower
than that of the closer cells); threshold voltage
reached after programming (also variable); and weak
erasure phenomena.Another drawback typical of flash-EEPROM memories
is the possibility of read errors, due to the presence
of overerased cells and the absence of selection
transistors for each cell as on EEPROM memories.A biasing method of the type defined in the preamble of
claim 1 is disclosed in DE-A-42 13 741 describing a
conventional biasing method. Analog biasing methods are
disclosed in WO-A-8 906 429 and US-A-4 972 371.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a flash-EEPROM memory biasing method designed to
overcome the aforementioned drawbacks.  According to the present invention, there is
provided a
