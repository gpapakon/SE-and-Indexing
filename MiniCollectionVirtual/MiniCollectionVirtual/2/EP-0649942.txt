orifice (76) and the opening when the aerosol container actuator is 

seated within the base assembly, at least one wall (97,48) extending 
upward from the base surface and defining two actuator-orienting 

guides (43,44) , the guides being defined by substantially arcuate-shaped 
profiles substantially disposed in respective guide planes, the 

guide planes (43,44) being disposed at an angle to one another of less 
than 180° and at an angle of less than 90° to the base plane, the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
actuator, and corresponding base, for use in effecting the
discharge of material from aerosol containers. The
invention is particularly useful when it is desired to
discharge material from the end, as opposed to a side, of
an actuator, e.g., when striping a parking lot.Aerosol spray cans which are filled with marking
material, such as paints, dyes, and the like, are
frequently used in marking traffic and parking lines on
pavement, boundary lines on athletic fields, restricted
areas on golf courses, and other indicators, both permanent
and non-permanent. When using an aerosol container to
produce such marks, it is often desirable to provide an
actuator which has an elongated, e.g., rectangular,
orifice. The use of such an orifice helps ensure that the
material, when discharged from the container, provides a
well defined stripe of the desired width.If an actuator with an elongated orifice is used in
conjunction with a movable device to provide a stripe, the
actuator is typically oriented with respect to the spraying
device such that the longest dimension of the orifice is
oriented perpendicular to the direction of movement of the
device. In that regard, U.S. Patent 4,126,273 is said to
provide an actuator and actuator-orientator base assembly
which is able to provide such perpendicular orientation.
Moreover, that combination is said to provide for the
automatic orientation of the actuator, and thus the
orifice, upon insertion of the actuator into the
orientator. The actuator provided thereby is generally in
the shape of a large cylinder, with lugs protruding from
its perimeter. The orientator into which the actuator is
inserted includes a generally tubular wall and a radially 
outwardly flared upper portion. About half of the tubular
wall is recessed, or notched, such that four curved or
spiral guide surfaces are provided therein. Those guide
surfaces terminate in a pair of diametrically opposed
rectangular recesses. When the actuator is inserted into
the orientator, the lugs engage the curved guide surfaces;
the weight of the container causing the lugs to slide
downwardly along those surfaces. During this sliding, the
can and actuator rotate to bring the lugs into alignment
with the recesses. Upon such alignment, the lugs drop into
the recesses, this preventing any further rotation of the
actuator.Another actuator and base which may be used in
connection with marking devices are disclosed in U.S.
Patent 4,396,153. The actuator disclosed therein has two
pairs
