<ABSTRACT>
A trocar system for assisting in the generation of endosurgical ports is disclosed in which a trocar facilitator is used to place the peritoneum in counter-traction to facilitate the penetration of the trocar. Peritoneal counter-traction results in increased surface tension which reduces the force and downward momentum necessary to achieve trocar penetration, thereby eliminating the risk of excess penetration and injury to internal organs. The facilitator is of a corkscrew-like design, with an attached support ring and a removable guide piece having a hollow, cylindrical passageway which aids in the insertion and support of the trocar, cannula, and other endoscopic surgical instruments. In another embodiment, the facilitator is configured to aid in the introduction of carbon dioxide gas into the abdominal cavity of the patient. An improved curved tip of the blade of the trocar facilitator is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trocar facilitator
and, more specifically, to a facilitator having a counter-traction
mechanism to aid in the penetration of the trocar
into a patient's body while eliminating the previous risks
associated with trocar use.Endoscopic surgery is a procedure by which operations on
internal portions of a patient's body are performed on a
minimally intrusive basis. Such surgery is accomplished by
creating small incisions or ports in the patient's body
through which various small, remotely controllable instruments
may be manipulated. The procedure is accomplished visually
with the aid of an endoscope, hence the name endoscopic
surgery. Substantial advantages are realized from this form
of surgery, including reduced trauma to the patient, less risk
of death or complications, and rapid recovery.The endoscope is a thin, tubular instrument utilizing
fiber optics which allows a surgeon to remotely view internal
body structures. As such, endoscopes typically have lenses
located at an insertion or distal end, and an ocular or viewer
located at the proximal end of the instrument outside of the
body. Often times, the viewer takes the form of a video
monitor. A light source is provided at the distal end to
illuminate the internal body area. Various tools are used to
perform the procedures associated with the surgery, as viewed
by the endoscope. These tools often include retractors,
irrigators, snippers, lasers, and the like.Each of these tools, along with the endoscope itself,
must be inserted in a patient's body through a port, as noted
above. A port is comprised of an incision in the patient's
body into which a hollow, tubular cannula is inserted. The
cannula then serves as a conduit for receiving and supporting
the endoscopic instruments. Such a trocar system is
disclosed in DE-U-91 02 553. A trocar is
guided in a sleeve provided with a screw-like
blade for engaging human tissues and for limiting
axial movement of the trocar in distal and proximal
direction. An endoscopic port is created and the cannula is
simultaneously placed therein by means of a trocar. A trocar
is a surgical instrument having a sharp triangular point that
enters the body through a small surgical stab incision. The
cannula fits over the trocar and enters the incision along
with it, such that after the port is created and the trocar is
removed, the cannula remains in place to define the endoscopic
port. Typically, the cannula includes a headpiece which has
a stopcock or other valve to control the flow of
