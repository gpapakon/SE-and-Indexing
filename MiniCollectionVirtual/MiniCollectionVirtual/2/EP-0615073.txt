<ABSTRACT>
Combination comprising nut (10) and washer (30) for bracing a threaded bolt (44a, 44b) which can move axially in a bore (42a, 42b) and, at one end of the bore, can be fixed in a positively locking manner in the axial direction by a stop surface (54) and, at the other end of the bore, extends out of the same, the nut exhibiting a radial slot (24) which reaches as far as its thread (14) and extends over the entire height of the nut, characterised in that the split nut (10) further exhibits, at one thread end, a concentrically arranged collar (16) with a centring surface (18) which is inclined with respect to the axis (A) of the nut, in that a circular stop surface (20) adjoins the centring surface (18) towards the outside, and in that the inner wall (34) of the hole (32) of the washer is inclined in a manner complementary to the centring surface (18). It is thus achieved that a threaded bolt which can move axially in a bore and, at one end of the bore, can be fixed in a positively locking manner in the axial direction by a stop surface and, at the other end of the bore, extends out of the same can be braced with high tightening moments without, in the case of said high tightening moments, the nut slipping off the threaded bolt, as a result of the forces arising, approximately radially with respect to the thread axis.

Combination of a nut (10) and a washer (30) for 
restraining a bolt (44a, 44b), which is axially 

movable in a bore (42a, 42b) and which may be form-lockingly 
fixed in position in the axial direction 

at one end of the bore (42a, 42b) by an engagement 
surface (54) and, at the other end of the bore (42a, 

42b) passes out of it, whereby the nut (10) has a 
slot (24), which extends over its entire height and 

extends radially to its thread (14), and, at one end 
of the thread, a concentrically disposed collar (16) 

with a centring surface (18) inclined to the axis 
(A) of the nut (10) and the inner wall (34) of the 

hole (32) in the washer (30) extends inclined at an 
angle complementary to the centring surface (18); 

the centring surface (18) and the inner wall (34) of 
the hole (32) are frustoconical surfaces; and the 

external diameter of the frustoconical surface (36a, 
36b) on the washer (30) is smaller than the external 

diameter of the frustoconical surface of the 
centring surface (18); characterised in that the 

inner wall (34) of the hole (32) in the washer (30) 
comprises two outwardly diverging frustoconical 

surfaces (36a, 36b); the basic geometrical shape of 
the nut (10) has a straight circular cylinder (12), 

which contains a threaded bore (14) and adjoining 
which in the outward direction there is a circular 

disc (22) having an engagement surface (20); which 
has a radially extending unloading gap (26) arranged 

opposite to the slot (24) in the nut (10) and is 
shortened by a circular segment arranged at right-angles 

to the slot (24); the nut (10) has two wing-like  
 

gripping surfaces (28a, 28b) which are disposed 
in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the slot 

(24) passing through the nut axis (A) and are 
connected to the circular cylinder (12) and extend 

over the entire free height of the same; the nut 
(10) and the washer (30) are manufactured from 

plastic material in an injection moulding process 
and the centring surface (18) and the inner wall 

(34) are inclined at an angle of 30Â°. 
Fastening device for a pivotable WC seat (48, 50) 
with a support plate (52), a bolt (44a, 44b) 

extending downwardly perpendicular to it, a pivot 
pin (46a, 46b) arranged horizontally and spaced from 

the support plate and a fastening element screwable 
onto the bolt, characterised in that the fastening 

element is a combination of a nut (10) and washer 
(30) as claimed in Claim 1. 
Fastening device for a pivotable WC seat as claimed 
in Claim 2, characterised in that the support plate, 

the bolt extending downwardly perpendicular to it 
and the pivot pin arranged horizontally spaced from 

the support plate are of one-piece construction and 
ar
e manufactured from a plastics material in an 
injection moulding process. 
Fastening device for a pivotable WC seat as claimed 
in Claim 2, characterised in that the bolt (44a, 

44b) merges into an unthreaded, angled portion (46a, 
46b) constituting the pivot pin and that the support 

plate (52) is screwable onto the bolt. 
Fastening device for a pivotable WC seat as claimed  
 

in Claim 4, characterised in that the bolt (44a, 
44b) and support plate (52) comprise metal.
