<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of the gene product of a herpes simplex 
virus UL13 gene in an assay for screening substances 
for their anti-herpes simplex viral activity. The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome encodes at least 76 genes 
(McGeoch, et al., 1985; Chou, et al., 1986; McGeoch, et al., 1988; Liu, et al, 1991; 
Barker, et al., 1992). Inasmuch as three of the genes are contained within repeated 
sequences, the genome encodes at least 73 polypeptides. The 76 genes comprise 
several groups designated as α, β and γ, whose expression is coordinately regulated 
and sequentially ordered in a cascade fashion (Honess, et al., 1974). For the past two 
decades, this laboratory has investigated the mechanisms by which HSV-1 regulates 
the expression and function of its genes. In the course of these studies, we 
demonstrated that (i) initiation of transcription of viral genes is induced by a 
structural component of the virion (Post, et al., 1981; Batterson, et al., 1983), (ii) 
regulatory proteins induced by this process are phosphorylated (Pereira, et al., 1977; 
Marsden, et al., 1978) and (iii) binding of these proteins to DNA is affected by 
phosphorylation (Wilcox, et al., 1980). Since protein kinases (PK) are known to 
affect the function of regulatory proteins, we sought to identify the substrates of viral 
PKs and clarify their function. Both HSV-1 US3 and UL13 gene products contain motifs common to 
known protein kinases (McGeoch, et al., 1985; McGeoch, et al., 1988; McGeoch, 
et al., 1986; Smith, et al., 1989). Definitive evidence of US3 PK activity emerged  
 
from the observations that (i) the novel enzyme activity detected in cells infected with 
wild type virus was absent from uninfected cells and cells infected with a mutant from 
which the US3 gene had been deleted (Purves, et al., 1986; Frame, et al., 1987), and 
(ii) antibody raised against a synthetic eight-amino acid C-terminal US3 oligopeptide 
reacted with purified preparations of the enzyme (Frame, et al., 1987). Recently, we 
demonstrated that the most prominent target of the US3 PK is an essential, non 
glycosylated membrane protein encoded by a highly conserved herpesvirus gene, 
UL34 (Purves, et al., 1991; Purves, et al., 1992). In the absence of US3, the 
nonphosphorylated UL34 protein associates with several phosphorylated proteins not 
demonstrable in cells infected with wild type virus. Concurrently, it was shown that 
the US11 protein may act as an antiterminator of transcription of UL34 inasmuch as 
(i)
