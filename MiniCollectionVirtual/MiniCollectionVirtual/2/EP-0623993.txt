<ABSTRACT>
A four quadrant multiplier circuit having a high dynamic 
range and capable of operating at low voltages comprises a 

dual transconductance amplifier circuit (TAC) consisting of NPN 
transistors (20 to 23 and 64 to 67), coupled to a first input 

port (36), first and second folded Darlington circuits (57,58), 
and a resistive element (78). Each said Darlington circuit 

comprises first and second NPN transistors (68,70 and 69,71) 
whose emitter-collector paths are connected in series and a third 

PNP transistor (72,73) having its emitter-collector path 
connected between the collector of the first transistor (68,69) 

and the base electrode of the second transistor (70,71). The 
emitter-collector junction (76,77) of the first and second 

transistors (68,70 and 69,71) is connected to the base electrode 
of the third transistor (72,73). The resistive element (78) is 

connected between the base electrodes of the third transistors 
(72,73). A second input port (56) is connected to the base 

electrodes of the first transistors (68,69). The emitter 
currents of the dual transconductance amplifier are supplied by 

way of current mirror circuits (80,81) from the emitter currents 
of the second transistors (70,71). The transconductance 

amplifier circuit (TAC) may be of any suitable type which has its 
transconductance linearly proporti
onal to its emitter currents. 
In a refinement of the circuit, the current to voltage converter 

function of the current mirrors is carried out by the second 
transistors (70,71) and the transistors (82,83) of the current 

mirror circuits (80,81) are omitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a four quadrant multiplier 
circuit which has particular, but not exclusive, application in 
demodulating FM signals in zero-IF receivers. The use of four quadrant multiplier circuits for 
demodulating FM signals is known for example from British Patent 
Specification 1 530 602 in which baseband I and Q signals are 
multiplied by the differentials of the Q and I signals, 
respectively. These multipliers need a high dynamic range 
because, unless the demodulator is preceded by an automatic gain 
control (agc) system with infinitely good regulation, their 
signal inputs will not be constant. Dynamic range in the present 
specification means the range of signal inputs over which 
adequate demodulator performance is obtained, given that 
statistical DC offset causes distortion at low signal input 
levels and limiting non-linearity causes distortion at high 
signal input levels. Noise is generally not a significant 
constraint at this late stage in a receiver. Basic four quadrant 
multiplier circuits are already known for example from U.S. 
Patent Specification 3 241 078. This citation discloses 
a circuit comprising a first long tailed pair circuit for 
receiving a first pair of balanced voltage inputs and a second 
long tailed pair circuit comprising a second pair of long tailed 
pair circuits for processing signals at a second pair of balanced 
voltage inputs. There are two main drawbacks to this circuit. 
The dynamic range is barely sufficient for this application and 
the inputs are stacked one above the other across the supply. 
This stacking means that the inputs lie in two non-overlapping 
voltage ranges and makes it difficult to operate at low supply 
voltages.  
 Four quadrant multiplier circuits without stacking are 
already known for example from Chadwick, P. E. "Low power, low 
voltage receiver integrated circuits", Institution of Electronic 
and Radio Engineers Publication Number 78, Proceedings of the 
Fourth International Conference on Land Mobile Radio, University 
of Warwick, Coventry 15th-17th December 1987, pages 155-161. The 
cited circuit uses PNP transistors in the first tailed pair 
circuit. Stacking is obviated in that the signal path between 
the first and the second pair of long tailed pair circuits is by 
way of current mirror circuits but the problem of limited dynamic 
range remains. A drawback to this circuit is that the PNP 
transistors are a source of difficulty because lateral PNP 
transistors available in standard bipolar processes are slow
