<ABSTRACT>
Dental bleaching compositions that include a high concentration of bleaching agent and a bleaching agent stabilizer that maintains the potency of the bleaching agent over time. The dental bleaching compositions of the present invention may be one-part, pre-mixed compositions that do not require mixing at the time of treating a patient's teeth but which remain stable over time. The bleaching agent may consist of hydrogen peroxide, either in aqueous form or complexed with urea (carbamide peroxide) or sodium perborate. The bleaching agent stabilizer includes an impurity scavenger that binds or ties up impurities, such as errant or residual metal ions, that can cause decomposition of the bleaching agent. The bleaching agent stabilizer may include a carboxylic acid chelator or a tin salt. The bleaching composition may include a thickening agent to achieve a selected viscosity and a neutralizing agent to adjust the pH and a carrier to help provide selected consistency and potency. The dental bleaching compositions may be adapted to be loaded into and delivered from a syringe.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DENTAL BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. The Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to dental bleaching compositions and methods for treating tooth surfaces. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a stable one-component viscous/gelled dental bleaching composition that has a high concentration of bleaching agent. The dental bleaching compositions of the present invention can optionally include a radiant-energy and/or beat-energy absorbing substance which can absorb these forms of energy and cause the bleaching agent to more quickly bleach the tooth surfaces. 2. The Relevant TechnologyThe use of certain foods and tobacco, the process of aging, diseases, trauma, medications, some congenital conditions, and environmental effects can cause teeth to become discolored. Because white or whitened teeth are usually considered to be aesthetically superior to stained or discolored teeth, there has been a heightened level of interest of late in developing compositions and methods for bleaching teeth.A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer hard enamel layer that is slightly porous. The natural color of the tooth is opaque to translucent white or off- white.Some dentrifices, like toothpastes, gels, and powders contain active oxygen or hydrogen peroxide liberating bleaching agents. Such bleaching agents include peroxides, percarbonates and perborates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals or complex compounds containing hydrogen peroxide. Also, peroxide salts of the alkali or alkaline earth metals are known to be useful in whitening teeth.The most commonly used dental bleaching agent is carbamide peroxide (CO(NH2)2-H2O2), also called urea hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide carbamide, and perhydrol-urea. Carbamide peroxide has been used by dental clinicians for several decades as an oral antiseptic. Tooth bleaching was an observed side effect of extended contact time. Over-the-counter compositions of 10% carbamide peroxide are available as "GLY-OXIDE®" by Marion Laboratories and "PROXIGEL®" by Reed and Carnrick. An extended-contact application of bleaching gel held in a dental tray is available as "OPALESCENCE®" by Ultradent. Other bleaching agents such as peroxyacetic acid (CH3C=OO-OH) and sodium perborate, are also known in the medical, dental and cosmetic arts.Patients who have desired to have their teeth whitened have typically done so by applying a bleaching composition to the teeth by means of the
