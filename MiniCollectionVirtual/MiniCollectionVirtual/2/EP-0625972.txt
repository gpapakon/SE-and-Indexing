Process for the preparation of the compounds 
of formula: 


 
in which R represents a polyfluoroalkoxy radical, characterized 

in that 

a) a derivative of formula: 

 
in which R has the same meanings as in formula (I) is 

nitrated, and 
b) the compound of formula: 

 
in which R has the same meanings as in formula (I), thus 

obtained is reacted with ammonium hydroxide. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the nitration is carried out using a nitric 

acid/sulphuric acid mixture. 
Process according to either of claims 1  
 

and 2, characterized in that a nitric acid/sulphuric acid 
mixture is used containing 1 part by volume of concentrated 

nitric acid and 1 to 5 parts by weight of concentrated 
sulphuric acid. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that 1 to 10 parts by volume of nitric 

acid/sulphuric acid mixture are used per one part by 
weight of the compound of formula (II) used. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the nitration is carried out at a 

temperature between 0째C and 20째C. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the reaction of step b) is carried 

out in a closed reactor. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the reaction of step b) is carried 

out in an organic solvent such as an alcohol. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that 5 to 20 parts by weight of ammonium 

hydroxide are used per one part by weight of a derivative 
of formula (III). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the reaction of step b) is carried 

out at a temperature of between 10째C and 150째C.
