The present invention provides a method for making an image 
comprising the steps of: 


placing a dye donor element, having on a support a dye layer 
containing a thermally transferable dye, with said dye layer in 

face-to-face relationship with an image receiving element; 
image-wise heating a thus obtained assemblage by activating a 
number of heating elements of a thermal head being in contact with 

said dye donor element, each of said heating elements corresponding 
to an image pixel and 
separating said dye donor element from said image receiving 
element; 
 
characterised in that during said image-wise heating, heating 

elements corresponding to an image pixel for which no density is 
required are activated such that they generate an amount of heat 

(H

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making an image 
according to the thermal transfer process wherein the image is 
formed by heating an assemblage of a dye donor element and an image 
receiving element by means of a thermal head. More in particular, 
the present invention relates to a thermal transfer process wherein 
wearing of the thermal head is reduced. Thermal dye transfer methods include thermal dye sublimation 
transfer also called thermal dye diffusion transfer. This latter is 
a recording method in which the amount of dye that is transferred to 
an image receiving element can be controlled by controlling the 
amount of heat supplied to the assemblage of a dye-donor element and 
receiving element. Image-wise heating can be carried out by means of a thermal head 
having a plurality of heating elements i.e. heat-generating 
resistors. Generally an assemblage of a dye-donor element and a 
receiving element will be heated by a thermal head from the back of 
the dye donor element i.e. the side of the support of the dye-donor 
element opposite to the side containing the dye layer. The back of 
such a dye donor element is commonly provided with a backing layer 
containing a heat-resistant binder and a number of additives such as 
particles and lubricants to assure a smooth transport of the dye 
donor element over the thermal head. Image-wise heating of the assemblage is generally carried out 
line by line wherein the image information is divided in a number of 
lines which are consecutively supplied to the thermal head. Such a 
line of image data consists of a number of image pixels representing 
an image value to be reproduced. By activating each of the heating 
elements, which are arranged in a line one along the other, in 
accordance with the image value of the image pixel to which they 
correspond the image data of one line can be reproduced. For example 
if the image value of an image pixel is zero the corresponding 
heating element for the image pixel will not be activated whereas 
when the image value of an image pixel represents a certain density 
the image pixel will be activated so as to obtain the desired  
 
density on the image receiving element. This process is repeated 
for all lines of the image so as to obtain a complete reproduction 
thereof. A problem with the above method is that the heating elements of 
the thermal head wear with the number of prints being made. As a 
consequence their efficiency decreases causing a reduction in 
quality of the image. This problem is
