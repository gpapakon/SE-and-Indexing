<ABSTRACT>
A three-way valve including a valve housing having a valve chamber 
and a high pressure fluid supply inlet, high pressure fluid outlet and 

drain 
communicating with the valve chamber is disclosed. A movable member (12) 

is reciprocally received in the valve chamber so as to be reciprocated 
between first and second positions for selectively fluidically 

communicating 
the outlet with either the inlet or drain. A first valve seat (32) is 

formed in the 
valve housing and concentrically disposed in the valve chamber for 

sealing 
communication between the outlet and drain and a second valve 

seat (40) is 
concentrically disposed in a cavity formed in the movable member for 

sealing communication between the inlet and outlet. A floating pin (16) 
is 

received in the movable valve member cavity at a one end of the movable 
valve member and cooperates with the second valve seat for selectively 

sealing fluidic communication between the inlet and the outlet. An 
actuating device is mounted on the valve housing adjacent an end of the 

movable valve member opposite the floating pin for advancing the movable 
valve member toward the first position when energized and for allowing 

the movable valve member to retract to the second position when 
de-energized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a three-way valve adapted to 
selectively control the flow of fluid between a fluid supply, a load device 
and a drain. Three-way valves have long been used for controlling fluid flow in 
a variety of air and hydraulic systems, particularly fuel systems. Such 
three-way valves often control the passage of fluid under high pressure 
from a source to a load device and selectively interrupt the flow of 
pressurized fluid while simultaneously connecting the load device to a 
substantially unpressurized drain. Typically, a three-way valve includes a 
valve housing having first, second and third valve passages interconnected 
by an internal valve chamber containing two valve seats and a valve 
member movable by an actuating device connected to the movable valve  
 
member to control fluid flow among the three valve passages by moving 
between 
(1) a first position in which the movable valve member engages 
a first one of the valve seats to isolate the third of the valve passages 
from the internal chamber while allowing fluid communication between the first 
and second valve passages through the second valve seat and internal 
chamber, and (2) a second position in which the movable valve member 
engages the second valve seat to isolate the second valve passage 
while allowing fluid communication between the first and third valve 
passages through the first valve seat and internal chamber. As is well recognized, both valve manufacturers and designers of 
components incorporating valve assemblies continually strive to minimize 
the size, weight and cost of valve assemblies while maintaining the high 
operating requirements demanded for controlling the flow of very high 
pressure fluids. Thus, the above-discussed three-way valve assembly 
requires a valve assembly including an actuator assembly, a movable valve 
member and a floating pin which are operatively positioned relative to one 
another to minimize the size and weight of both the actuator assembly and 
the entire valve assembly while permitting a simple connection between the 
actuator and the valve element. Also, it is important to design a valve 
assembly capable of being operated by a conventional, "off-the-shelf" 
actuator assembly thereby eliminating the costs involved in procuring a 
specially designed actuator assembly. A known type of three-way valve is the "pin-within-a-sleeve" design. 
For example, both US-A-3,680,782 and US-A-5,038,826 
disclose a "pin within a sleeve" type three-way  
 
valve using a high
