<ABSTRACT>
A gas treatment installation of the type known as a combustion exchanger, comprising a generative combustion bed in which one or several heaters are located to heat the bed and to initiate the chemical reaction. The heaters for initiating the reaction are placed out-of-center in the bed, i.e. outside the central part of the bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the destruction of pollutants through combustion 
in a gas treatment installation of the type known as a 
combustion exchanger, electric heaters are often used to 
maintain the correct operational temperature in the middle 
of the combustion bed. This is the case in WO-A-8 600 389 (US-A-4 741 690) 
deemed to be the most relevant state of the art. According 
to the teachings therein the pollutants are fed into the 
combustion exchanger in which the pollutants are self-combusted 
and/or are made to self-decompose. The hot gas 
leaving the heat-exchanger is used to heat the pollutant-laden 
incoming gas through counter-current regenerative 
heat exchange. If the chemical energy developed in the 
form of heat during the destruction of the pollutants is 
sufficient, there is, however, no need for supply of 
electric energy. The installation is, in this case, self) 
sustaining and the electric heaters need only be used to 
start the operation of the installation. The start-up 
requirement is that the temperature to sufficiently high 
to ensure continuation of the reaction of destruction. 
Once the reaction has started, it generates by itself the 
heat required to maintain the temperature level, provided 
the chemical energy from the reacting pollutants is 
sufficient. When the energy emanating from the pollutant is insufficient 
to maintain the operational temperature in the 
bed at the required level, it is possible, instead of 
using the electric heaters, to mix additional fuel into 
the air to be cleaned, in order to provide the required 
heat. For instance, natural gas or propane could be added 
to the polluted stream of air. Also vaporized solvents are 
sometimes used. Often the prices of energy make it less 
expensive to add fuel than to resort to heating by 
electricity.  
 The dimensions of the electric heating system in an 
electrically heated combustion exchanger generally are 
chosen to ensure that the installation can be operated at 
full air flow and maintain the operational temperature, 
also when the air temporarily contains no pollutants that 
generate energy. In other words, the installation should 
be able to function also with clean air. One consequence 
of this is that the electric connections must be 
dimensioned for considerable power requirements. However,  
 
it is costly to have to provide for considerable power for 
the electric heaters with consequential large connected 
power, which means considerable costs, although the 
equipment perhaps is in use only very unfrequently. The

A gas treatment installation of the type known as 
a combustion exchanger, comprising a generative combustion 

bed in which one or several heaters are located for the 
purpose of heating the bed and initiating the chemical 

reaction, 
characterized
 in that the heaters 
for initiating the chemical reaction are positioned out of 

center in the bed, i.e. outside the central part of the 
bed, and in that said combustion exchanger is provided 

with air-direction changing equipment (2) designed to 
displace the hottest zone to the middle of the bed rapidly 

following start-up by controlling the airflow 
direction through the bed upwards and downwards either at 

intervals of mutually different lengths, or varying the 
flow volumes through the bed pe
r time unit. 
A combustion exchanger as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the heaters (7) are 
positioned in the upper part of the bed.
