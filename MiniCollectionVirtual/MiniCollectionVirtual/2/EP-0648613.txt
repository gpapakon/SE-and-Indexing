<ABSTRACT>
A method for treating a thermally transferred image is 
disclosed. The method comprising the steps of (1) thermally 

transferring an image from the ink layer of a ink sheet which 
comprises a support and a ink layer comprising a sublimation 

dye provided on the support, to the surface of an image 
receiving layer of a image receiving element which comprises a 

support and a image receiving layer provided on the support, 
by means of imagewise heating by a first thermal head, and (2) 

heating the surface of the image receiving layer having the 
transferred image by a second thermal head through a plastic 

film contacted to the surface of the image receiving layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an a method for creating 
a thermally transferred image method and more particularly to 
an image treating method capable of raising the processing 
speed, quality and durability of an image formed by 
sublimation type thermal transfer. There have come widely used in recent years a variety of 
cards represented by licenses such as driver's licenses, 
identification cards, membership cards with a photograph, 
certification cards and name cards with a photograph. On the surface of these cards, or image receiving bodies, 
an image of the owner's face is often formed for 
identification. Since such an image of a person's face has 
gradation, it is also referred to as a gradation containing 
image. Such a gradation containing image is not limited to an  
 
image of a person's face, and as long as an image has 
gradation, it is called a gradation containing image. It is well known that an image formed of a sublimation 
dye can be improved in fixedness and color tone by subjecting 
it to surface heat treatment. As a typical conventional 
technique for such heat treatment, Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. 
No. 55870/1992 proposes to carry out heat treatment, after 
thermally transferring a sublimation dye from a transfer sheet 
onto an image receiving element using a thermal head, by 
applying heat to the image surface through dye-unapplied 
portions of the transfer sheet using the same thermal head as 
the above. A similar disclosure is made by EP-A-251170. 
However, conducting image formation with a 
sublimation dye and heat treatment of a resulting image using 
the same thermal head has a disadvantage of requiring a longer 
processing time, because a sheet carrying a thermally 
transferred image has to be turned back again in the reverse 
direction for each image to receive heat treatment. Further, 
in carrying out heat treatment, the heat energy applied to a 
thermal head is greater than that appropriate to form an image 
effectively; therefore, the heating resistor of such a thermal 
head cannot be cooled adequately after the heat treatment and 
thereby accumulates heat in continuous processing. When a 
thermally transferred image is formed using such a heat 
accumulating thermal head, heat energy is excessively applied 
to unnecessary portions of an image forming area, producing 
unnecessary densities, or so called fog, in the high light  
 
portions of an image. This is another disadvantage involved 
in this technique. Further, for the purpose of protecting an image formed, 
ther
