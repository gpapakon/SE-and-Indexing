<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to that disclosed in
U.S. 4,783,803 entitled "Speech Recognition Apparatus and Method", U.S.
4,866,778 entitled "Interactive Speech Recognition Apparatus" and U.S.
5,027,406 entitled "Method for Interactive Speech Recognition and
Training", assigned to the assignee of the present application.This invention relates generally to speech recognition systems, and
in particular, to methods and apparatus for recognizing compound words.Data processing systems for recognizing human speech, such as
systems capable of transcribing dictation, have been developed. Due to
advances in computer technology, as well as advances in the development
of speech recognition algorithms, those systems have become increasingly
more powerful. For example, assignee of the present invention currently
markets a system capable of recognizing 30,000 words. Many of the
features of that system are described in the above referenced patent,
U.S.4,783,803.GB 2082820 describes a system for converting speech into written
form wherein the limited vocabulary of the translator is overcome by
providing a mode that allows an unrecognised word to be verbally spelled
out by the user letter by letter. In Patent Abstracts of Japan, Volume 6. No. 159 (P-136), a voice
recognition system is described wherein Japanese words are spoken into
the system and a character is retrieved from a character memory and
displayed. If the displayed character is wrong, a candidate character list is
provided from which another character may be selected by the user.US 4914704 describes a text editor for speech input where spoken
words that are recognised as being present in a dictionary are displayed
and words that are not recognised are typed in by the user, character by
character.In IEICE Transactions, Volume E74, No. 7, July 1991, p1811-1815,
Kenji et al., a continuous speech recognition system is described to
process unknown words, whereby words that are not in the lexicon are
transcribed as phone sequences using mathematical modelling of an
utterance, taking into account such factors as the characteristics of
language. Many present speech recognition systems
operate by matching a representation of an acoustic
signal generated in response to an utterance of the
word to be recognized against acoustic descriptions,
or models of words in a vocabulary. Typically, an
analog to digital converter converts the acoustic
signal, generated by speaking the word to be
recognized, into a digital representation. That

<CLAIMS>
A speech recognition system (10) for recognising compound words
from an utterance representative of a succession of one or more formatives

from a predetermined vocabulary, wherein each of said formatives has an
associated acoustic model stored in a memory (42), the system

comprising a user interface (14,26,28,30,32;84) including means
responsive to a user-generated auditory signal or a keyboard command,

for selecting between a first mode and a second mode of operation, the
speech recognition system being characterised by a word recogniser

(12,82) including

means selectively operative in the first mode, being an identification
mode, for matching formatives of said utterance with associated acoustic

models; for identifying said matched formatives and said associated
acoustic models that are representative of a single compound word; and

for combining said matched formatives in response to said identification for
generating a single compound word, and
means selectively operative in the second mode, being a delimiting
mode, for matching formatives of said utterance with associated acoustic

models; and for combining matched formatives spoken between a first
delimiter and a second delimiter into a single compound word.
A system according to claim 1 wherein said word recognizer in said
second mode is selectively operative in a sub-mode for identifying as a

character in said compound word keywords, such as International
Communication Alphabet words, spoken between said first delimiter and

said second delimiter, wherein each of said keywords is representative of a
correspondingly positioned character in said compound word. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein said word recognizer is
selectively operative in a third mode for identifying as a character in said

compound word keywords entered by a user, such as user-generated
auditory signals or keyboard commands, between said first delimiter and

said second delimiter, wherein each of said keywords is representative of a
correspondingly positioned character in said compound word.
A system according to claim 3, wherein one or more of said
keywords are
 International Communication Alphabet words.
A system according to claim 1 wherein said word recognizer
includes means for recognising said compound words from said utterance,

wherein said utterance contains one or more words spoken in isolation, or
spoken as continuous speech.
A system according to claim 1 wherein said means for matching said
acoustic models to said formatives of said utterance performs said

matching based at least in part on a language score which corresponds to
a language model probability estimate of the probability that said single

compound word would occur given a language context derived from one or
more of said formatives of said utterance, or a language model probability

estimate of the probability that said single compound word would occur
given a language context derived from one or more formatives which have

preceded said single compound word.
A system according to claim 1, wherein said word recognizer
includes means for matching said formatives of said utterance with said 

associated acoustic models according to a score representative of a
likelihood of a formative being included in said compound word with other

said formatives.
A speech recognition method for recognising compound words from
an utterance representative of a succession of one or more formatives from

a predetermined vocabulary, wherein each of said formatives has an
associated acoustic model stored in a memory (42) comprising the steps

of: selecting between a first mode and a second mode of operation, in
response to a user-generated auditory signal or a keyboard command; the

speech recognition method being characterised by the further steps of:

i) selectively operating in the first mode, being an identification mode,
and thereby matching formatives of said utterance with associated acoustic

models; identifying said matched formatives and said associated acoustic
models that are representative of a single compound word; and combining

said matched formatives in response to said identification for generating a
single compound word, and
ii) selectively operating in the second mode, being a delimiting mode,
and thereby matching formatives of said utterance with associated acoustic

models; and combining matched formatives spoken between a first
delimiter and a second delimiter into a single compound word.
The method according to claim 8, wherein operation in said second
mode includes the further step of selectively operating in a sub-mode to

identify as a character in said compound word keywords, such as
International Communication Alphabet words spoken between said first 

delimiter and said second delimiter, wherein each of said keywords is
representative of a correspondingly positioned character in said compound

word.
The method according to claim 8 including the further step of
selectively operating in a third mode to identify as a character in said

compound word keywords entered by a user, for example, through user
generated auditory signals or through user generated keyboard

commands, between said first delimiter and second delimiter, wherein each
of said keywords is representative of a correspondingly positioned

character in said compound word.
The method according to claim 10, wherein one or more of said
keywords are International Communication Alphabet words.
The method according to claim 8 including the further step of
speaking one or more of said words as isolated words or as continuous

speech.
The method according to claim 8, wherein operation in said first
mode includes the further step of matching said formatives of said

utterance with said associated acoustic models according to a score
representative of a likelihood of a formative being included in said

compound word with other said formatives.

mode includes the further step of matching said formatives of said

utterance with said associated acoustic models based at least in part on a 
language score which corresponds to a language model probability

estimate of the probability that said single compound word would occur
given a language context derived from one or more of said formatives of

said utterance, or a language model probability estimate of the probability
that said single compound word would occur given a language context

derived from one or more formatives which have preceded said single
compound word.
