<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method and 
assembly for loading the doctor blade 

of a doctoring unit used, e.g., in 
coating a paper web, characterized in 

that the blade can be loaded close to 
the edge of the blade without compromising 

the accuracy of blade profile 
control. The blade is loaded by means 

of a backing member (8) having a Z-shaped 
cross section in which one side 

of the section forms a base (13), while 
the middle part forms a waist (18) 

which turns toward the base (13), and 
the other side (12) of the shape forms 

tip (12) pointing to an opposite 
direction relative to the base (13) and 

has at its end a tapering edge suited 
for pressing against the doctor blade 

(7). This approach is capable of 
eliminating the sliding movement of the 

backing member (8) relative to the 
blade which tends to impair the 

accuracy of blade pressure control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly according to 
the preamble of claim 1 for loading the blade of a 
doctoring unit used for coating, e.g., a paper web. In coating of a paper web, the coat is smoothed onto the 
web most commonly using a doctor blade. The coat mix can 
first be applied onto the web using a separate applicator 
apparatus, whereby the doctor blade is placed at a 
distance in the machine direction from the point of 
application, or alternatively, a coating machine called a 
short-dwell coater can be used in which a application 
chamber is situated immediately beside the doctor blade 
and the applied coat is smoothed immediately by the 
doctor blade. The amount of coat mix adhering to the web being coated 
is adjusted by altering the loading of the doctor blade. 
When the blade loading is altered, also the actual angle 
of the doctor blade to the web changes, and the control 
of applied coat weight is temporarily unstable. This 
relates to the fact that the blade is contoured 
conformant with the web at the previously used blade tilt 
angle, and after the change of this angle, a certain time 
must elapse before the blade tip again wears conformant 
with the web. Changes in blade angle also cause other 
coat defects such as bleeding and uneven coat thickness. 
To avoid such defects, different types of systems have 
been developed suited for maintaining the blade angle as 
constant as possible irrespective of changes in blade 
loading.  
 A change in the doctor blade angle can be compensated for 
by either deflecting the blade so that the blade tip 
angle will not change, or alternatively, rotating the 
doctor blade support beam about the blade tip edge by an 
incremental angle corresponding to the change in the 
blade angle. Such a constant-angle control is easy to 
implement in doctor blade units removed from the 
applicator apparatus, because the doctor blade support 
beam does not carry other equipment related to the 
coating process. In the short-dwell coating process, the 
use of blade-deflecting arrangements is awkward, because 
the required apparatuses are difficult to adapt in 
conjunction with the extremely compact construction of 
the short-dwell coater. Therefore, the blade angle in 
short-dwell coaters is simply controlled by rotating the 
doctor blade support beam about the edge of the blade 
tip. Also in this manner the control of the blade angle 
in short-dwell coaters is complicated, because when the 
doctor blade support assembly is rotated about the edge 
of the
