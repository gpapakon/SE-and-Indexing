<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous composition containing primers for 
opposing strands of two or more target nucleic acids 

can be used in polymerase chain reaction to provide 
simultaneously rapid and efficient amplification and 

detection of those nucleic acids. The primers for each 
target DNA differ in length by no more than 5 

nucleotides and have a T
m
 within the range of from 65 
to 74°C, while the T
m
's are within about 5°C of each 
other. Such compositions are useful in diagnostic test 

kits and methods for amplification and detection of 
multiple nucleic acids, or in "multiplexing", using 

multiple capture probes. All of the capture probes 
have T
m
's which are greater than 50°C and are within 
15°C of each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diagnostic 
compositions, elements, methods and test kits for the 
amplification and detection of a multiplicity of 
nucleic acids associated with one or more infectious 
agents. In particular, it relates to improved methods 
of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using test kits and 
buffered compositions containing "matched" primers for 
a bacterial or viral DNA. Technology to detect minute quantities of 
nucleic acids associated with various infectious agents 
(including viruses, bacteria, fungus and protozoa) has 
advanced rapidly over the last ten years including the 
development of highly sophisticated hybridization 
assays using probes in amplification techniques such as 
PCR. Researchers have readily recognized the value of 
such technology to detect diseases and genetic features 
in human or animal test specimens. The use of probes 
and primers in such technology is based upon the 
concept of complementarity, that is the bonding of two 
strands of a nucleic acid by hydrogen bonds between 
complementary nucleotides (also known as nucleotide 
pairs). PCR is a significant advance in the art to 
allow detection of very small concentrations of a 
targeted nucleic acid. The details of PCR are 
described, for example, in US-A-4,683,195, US-A-4,683,202, 
and US-A-4,965,188 and by Mullis et al, 
Methods of Enzymology, 155, pp. 335-350 (1987). 
Without going into extensive detail, PCR involves 
hybridizing primers to the strands of a targeted 
nucleic acid (considered "templates") in the presence  
 
of a polymerization agent (such as a DNA polymerase) 
and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates under the 
appropriate conditions. The result is the formation of 
primer extension products along the templates, the 
products having added thereto nucleotides which are 
complementary to the templates. Once the primer extension products are denatured 
and one copy of each template has been prepared, the cycle 
of priming, extending and denaturation can be carried out 
as many times as desired to provide an exponential 
increase in the amount of nucleic acid which has the same 
sequence as the target nucleic acid. Despite the broad 
and rapid use of PCR in a variety of biological and 
diagnostic fields, there are still practical limitations 
which must be overcome to achieve the optimum success of 
the technology. It is well known that PCR is susceptible to a 
"carry-over" problem whereby amplified nucleic acids 
from one reaction may be inadvertently carried over 
into subsequent reactions
