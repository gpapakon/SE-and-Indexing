locations in the continuous data sequence respectively 

corresponding to the input events; specifying means (6) for 
specifying one of the input events stored in the second storage 

means; and playback means (5,7) for playing back a selected portion 
of the continuous data stored in the first storage means in

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for
playing back continuous data as well as to a method for playing back
selected portions of continuous data previously sequentially inputted and stored.Conventionally, the following methods have been proposed for
recording scenes in which one person or a plurality of persons talk,
such as a meeting, lecture, conversation over telephones and the
like (hereinafter generally referred to as a "conference").One method, which does not relate to a computer system, is to
record sound/pictures all during the conference or to dictate the
whole conference. Although this method is advantageous in that
information pertaining to the conference can be recorded to the
smallest details, it has a problem that desired information cannot
be selected immediately.Another method is to record the conference by taking notes of
its main points. While this method is advantageous in that one can
take a quick look at the record and know an outline of the
conference, it has a problem that because the notes are limited, it
is difficult to play back details of the conference. Especially,
because such information as nuances, atmosphere, tone, development
of a talk and the like is almost impossible to be described by
characters and figures, it is insufficient to take notes to
understand the details of the conference later. Further, because
a selection of contents to be described is put into the hands of a
note taker, this method has another problem that an important point
may be missed or a undesired point may be selected. Furthermore, 
there is such an inconvenience that when a participant of the conference takes notes,
he/she is obliged to focus in taking the notes, distracting his/her mind from participating
in the conference.Not only in the conference, there has existed no means in general for taking a
quick look at recorded sound/picture data in playing them back, so that a necessary part
cannot be selectively played back. Data such as sound/pictures data (hereinafter
generally referred to as "continuous data") comprises signals which change with time
such as audio and video signals. Due to that, there exists a problem that the whole
record has to be played back from the beginning or the necessary part has to be found
while the whole record is played back fast.Thus, conventionally, it has been difficult to readily select a desired part to be
played back from continuous data which have more detailed information.Playback apparatus in accordance with preamble of the
