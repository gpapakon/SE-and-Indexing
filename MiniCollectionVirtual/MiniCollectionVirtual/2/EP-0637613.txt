<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel resin
composition which is excellent in heat resistance,
mechanical strengths and melt moldability.Aromatic polyamideimide resins are plastic
materials excellent in heat resistance, mechanical
strengths, electrical properties and chemical
resistance, and have been so far used as varnishes,
films, etc. An aromatic polyamideimide resin is
produced typically by a method in which an aromatic
tricarboxylic acid anhydride and a diisocyanate are
reacted in a solvent or a method in which an aromatic
tricarboxylic acid anhydride halide and a diamine are
reacted in a solvent. However, the polyamideimide
resins produced by these methods are, though suitably
used in the preparation of varnishes, cast films, etc.,
not suitable for use in melt molding including
injection molding because of its inferior melt
moldability.In the specification of U.S. Patent No.
4,313,868, there is proposed a copolyamideimide for use
in injection-molding, said copolyamideimide having the
following recurring polyamideimide unit (I) and
recurring polyamide unit (II),
 
   wherein R is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon
radical having about 6 to about 20 carbon
atoms or a divalent hydrocarbon which is
bound to a group selected from the group
consisting of -O-, methylene, -CO- and -SO2-either
directly or via a stable linkage, and
X is a divalent aromatic radical,
the unit (I):unit (II) molar ratio being 80:20 to
20:80.Compared to a polyamideimide resin free of
the recurring unit (II), the above copolyamideimide has
improved melt moldability, but a flow starting time in
melt-molding of the copolyamideimide is close to a
decomposition temperature in melting of the
copolyamideimide, so that good molding of the
copolyamideimide remains unachieved.Japanese Laid-open Patent Application (Kokai)
No. 59-8,755 (8,755/1984) proposes an abrasion-resistant
resin molding material comprising an intimate
mixture of
(a) 30 to 90 % by weight of a polyamideimide
resin,(b) 10 to 70 % by weight of graphite and/or
molybdenum disulfide, and(c) 0 to 30 % by weight of at least one
member selected from a polyphenylene
sulfide resin, a polyamide resin and an
aromatic polyester resin which have
better flowability than the
polyamideimide resin.The above polyamideimide resin (a) is an
aromatic polymer which has 30 to 100 mol% of a
recurring unit represented by the formula (III), 

and which may have less than 70 mol% of a polyamide
unit represented by the formula (IV).

Ar in the formula (III) is a trivalent aromatic group
containing at
