<ABSTRACT>
A cathode ray tube comprising an electron gun. The electron gun has 
electrodes which are secured to supports by connecting elements. The width of said 

connecting elements varies. By virtue thereof, the high-voltage behaviour of the cathode 
ray tube is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cathode ray tube comprising a display screen
and an electron gun having a means for generating electrons, a number of electrodes
and a support which is composed of an insulating material, said electrodes being
provided with connecting elements which are secured in the support.Cathode ray tubes are used, inter alia, in television receivers, computer
monitors, oscilloscopes etc.A cathode ray tube of the class mentioned in the opening paragraph is of
the conventional type. The electron gun comprises a means for generating electrons, for
example a cathode. The electrodes are provided with connecting elements which are
pressed into the support. The support is generally made from glass which can be
softened. In the manufacture of the electron gun, the electrodes of the electron gun are
stacked on top of each other, whereafter the support is (or are, if more than one support
is used) heated. By virtue thereof, the support and the projections can be
interconnected. This is generally achieved by pressing the support against the
projections. Since the glass has been softened by heating, the connecting elements can
be inserted into the support. The connecting elements may be integral with the electrode
or they may be secured to the electrode as a separate part. After cooling, the electrodes
and the support are secured to each other.In operation, voltages are applied to the electrodes. Due to said voltages,
electro-optical fields are formed between the electrodes. The electrons generated are
accelerated and focused by means of said electric fields. Ever higher demands are
imposed on the quality of the electron-optical fields. As a result thereof, the number of
electrodes in the electron gun and the value of the applied voltages increase. A problem
which arises is that sometimes the electrodes themselves can generate electrons. These
electrons may hop between the electrodes. Due to this, the cathode ray tube may be
damaged, which leads to failure. Such electrons may also land on the display screen,
thereby adversely affecting the contrast of the image displayed. These phenomena 
occur, in particular, at locations where high voltages are applied to the electrodes.It is an object of the invention to provide a cathode ray tube of the type
mentioned in the opening paragraph, in which one or more than one of the above
problems is reduced.To this end, the cathode ray tube in accordance with the invention is characterized by the features defined in claim 1.Hopping of electrons between two

<CLAIMS>
A cathode ray tube (1) comprising a display screen (10) and an electron
gun (6) having a means for generating electrons, a number of electrodes and a support

(26) which is composed of insulating material, said electrodes being provided with
securing element (38, 39) which are secured in the support, characterized in that the

electron gun comprises a pair of electrodes (36, 37) which are arranged one behind the other,
said electrodes each having securing means (38, 39) extending in a plane transverse to

the electron beam, the distance transverse to the electron beam between the outside
edges of said securing element of one of the electrodes differing from that of the

securing element of the other electrode of the pair of electrodes, whereby the shortest
distance via the support between an outside edge of a securing element of one of the

electrodes to an outside edge of a securing element of the other electrode of the pair of
electrodes is greater than the distance between the securing elements viewed along the

electron beam. 
A cathode ray tube as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
cathode ray tube comprises means for applying voltages to the pair of electrodes and in

that, in operation, the voltage applied to the electrode having the widest securing
elements is lower than the voltage applied to the electrode having the narrowest

securing elements.
A cathode ray rube as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
difference in said distance between the outside edges of each securing element is greater than the distance between

the securing elements, viewed along the electron beams.
