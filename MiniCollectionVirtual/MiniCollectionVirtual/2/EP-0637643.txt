<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a sheet spreader for 
a sheet feeder apparatus comprising, at least one pair 

of sheet clamps (28), guideway means (60) to extend 
along an entry to a sheet feeder, means (61) to mount 

the clamps on the guideway means for movement along 
the entry to the sheet feeder and a plurality of sheet 

loading stations (18) located at fixed positions (A, B 

&
 C) opposite the guideway means. Each loading station 
has sheet clipping means (30, 31) to receive and 

support a pair of corners of a sheet and means (37, 
38) to effect transfer of the sheet corners from the 

clipping means to the pair of sheet clamps (28) on the 
guideway means when the clamps are located in a 

transfer position adjacent said loading station. Drive 
means (3, 63) to move the sheet clamps (28) of said 

pair independently of one another first together in a 
transfer position at a respective loading station (18) 

and then apart to spread the sheet received at a 
loading station for entry to the sheet feeder (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to spreader feeding 
machines for laundry and textile sheet fabric 
materials. Such machines are well known in the 
industry and over a number of years many various 
designs and types have been available to the markets. The machines which concern the invention are 
those where an operator manually loads the corners of 
an article such as a sheet or table cloth into a 
clipping mechanism which in turn transfers the loaded 
corners to a clamping and spreading mechanism which 
will spread and tension the leading edge of the sheet 
prior to it being fed onto the conveyor of the feeding 
machine for onward conveying to other processing 
equipment. Such machines are described in the 
following patent specifications: U.K. Nos. 1105901, 
1169513 and US 3664046. Production speeds of modern laundry processing 
equipment (such as ironing and folding machines) have 
risen significantly and a single operator cannot load 
the sheet corners to match current production 
requirements. According to the known state of the art 
described in the above mentioned patents the loading 
and transfer of the sheet corners present undesirable 
limitations. The clamping and spreading means are 
arranged to move inward and outward from a fixed 
central feed line position and the clip means must be 
movable to this position in order to transfer the 
sheet corners. A critical mechanical movement is then 
necessary to pick and remove the top edge corners of 
the sheet by the clamp means. The loading positions  
 
where multi-operator usage can be effectively employed 
is limited to the practical mechanics of the 
positioning movements of the clip means to the central 
transfer position. A further limitation is the portion of the 
corner which is actually gripped by the clamp. This 
is a relatively small area of the top edge of the 
sheet and consequently limits the amount of desirable 
tensioning force which can be exerted to spread the 
leading edge of the sheet without causing damage and 
tearing of the fabric. Outward spreading speeds and 
forces must therefore be restricted to prevent such 
damage occurring. An object of the present invention is to 
provide the high speed transfer of the corners of a 
sheet from a loading position to a clamping and 
spreading position with means to spread and tension 
the leading edge in preparation for onward feeding. More specifically the purpose of the invention 
is to provide improved means for clip loading the 
corners of a sheet, coupled with a faster means to 
transfer

<CLAIMS>
A sheet spreader for a sheet feeder 
apparatus comprising, at least one pair of sheet 

clamps, guideway means to extend along an entry to a 
sheet feeder, means to mount the clamps on the 

guideway means for independent movement along the 
entry to the sheet feeder, a plurality of sheet 

loading stations located at fixed positions opposite 
the guideway means, each loading station having sheet 

clipping means to receive and support a pair of 
corners of a sheet and means to effect transfer of the 

sheet corners from the clipping means to the pair of 
sheet clamps on the guideway means when the clamps are 

located in a transfer position adjacent said loading 
station, and means to move the sheet clamps of said 

pair independently of one another first together in a 
transfer position at a respective loading station to 

receive a sheet and then apart to spread the sheet for 
entry to the sheet feeder. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the clamp moving means moves the 

clamps from said loading station in tandem to a 
central location along the guideway before the clamps 

are moved apart to spread the sheet. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in any of 
claims 1 or 2, characterised in that means are 

provided for mounting the clipping means of the or 
each loading station for movement between a sheet 

receiving position remote from the sheet clamps and a 
sheet transfer position in which the sheet corners 

held by the clips are transferred to the sheet clamps. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that the means for moving the 

clipping means between said receiving and said 
transfer positions act in a general horizontal 

direction. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that the means for moving the 

clipping means between said receiving and said 
transfer positions act in an inclined direction from a 

lower loading position at a convenient level for an 
operator and to an upper transfer position to present 

the sheet end to the clamps and in so doing to lift at 
least a proportion of the body of the sheet to 

facilitate spreading of the sheet. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the clipping 

means include means for displacing side edge 
portions of the sheet into the clamps whilst the sheet 

is suspended by the clipping means. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in Claim 5, 

characterised in that the means for displacing 
side edge portions of the sheet supported by the 

clipping means into the clamps comprise air jet means. 
A sheet spreader as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterised in that the clipping means comprise a 

pair of vertically extending sheet support members 
mounted side by side one another to face the sheet 

clamps when the latter are in the loading station, 
releasable sheet clips acting on the adjacent faces of 

the members to hold the end of the sheet adjacent the 
corners on the members, means on the remote sides of 

 
the members to support the corner portions of the 

sheet laid against the members facing towards the 
clamps and air jet means on the members directed 

towards the clamps when in the loading station thereof 
to displace the side edge portions of the sheet laid 

on the members into the clamps when the latter are in 
said transfer position.
