<DESCRIPTION>
Ion-exchange resins are used by industry to separate 
chemical species from solutions containing them. Such 
resins are prepared by substituting various functional 
groups onto a copolymer bead matrix. The functional groups 
are capable of associating with the impurities so as to 
remove them from solution. Ion-exchange resins may be 
cation-, anion-, or chelate-exchange resins, depending on 
the choice of functional group substituted onto the 
copolymer bead matrix. The copolymer bead matrix may also 
be used in preparing polymeric adsorbents, such as those 
disclosed in US-A-4,950,332. The copolymer bead matrix is typically prepared by 
suspension polymerization of a finely divided organic phase 
comprising monovinylidene monomers like styrene, polyvinylidene 
monomers such as divinylbenzene, a free-radical 
initiator, and, optionally diluents which are either phase-separating 
or soluble; see, for example, US-A-4,224,415. 
The copolymer beads produced may be microporous, i.e., 
gellular in character, or macroporous, the result depending 
upon whether the phase-separating diluent is employed. The 
term "macroporous" as commonly used in the art means that 
the copolymer has both macropores and mesopores. The terms 
"microporous", "gel", and "macroporous" are well known in 
the art and generally describe the nature of the copolymer 
bead porosity. Microporous or gel copolymer beads have 
pore sizes on the order of less than 20 Angstroms (Å) (2 
nm), while macroporous copolymer beads have both mesopores 
of from 20 Å to 500 Å (2-50 nm) and macropores of greater 
than 500 Å (50 nm). Gel and macroporous copolymer beads, 
as well as their preparation, are further discussed in US-A-4,256,840.  
 Recently, industry has focused on methods of preparing 
copolymer beads in multi-staged polymerizations, also known 
as seeded polymerization processes. Such copolymer beads 
are desirable due to good mechanical strength and osmotic 
shock resistance. Seeded polymerization processes can also 
prepare beads of relatively uniform size if the seed 
particles employed have similar size uniformity. US-A-4,419,245 
and US-A-4,564,644 disclose processes wherein 
seed particles are suspended in a continuous medium and, 
thereafter, the seed particles are imbibed and polymerized 
with additional monomer to form copolymer beads. GB-A-1,151,480 
discloses a process wherein copolymer beads are 
prepared from porous seed particles. EP-A-0 062 088 
discloses the preparation of gel or macroporous copolymer 
beads by a seeded

<CLAIMS>
A process for making crosslinked copolymer beads 
suitable for making polymeric adsorbents and ion-exchange 

resins characterized by: 

(a) providing a suspension of a monomer mixture 
within a continuous aqueous suspending medium, the 

monomer mixture comprising at least one 
monoethylenically unsaturated monomer selected from 

styrene, paravinyltoluene, vinyltoluene, vinylbenzyl 
chloride or ethylvinylbenzene in an amount of from 20 

to 99.96 weight percent based on total weight of 
monomer 
mixture, at least one polyethylenically 
unsaturated monomer selected from divinylbenzene, 

ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol 
dimethacrylate or mixtures thereof in an amount of 

from 0.04 to 80 weight percent based on total weight 
of monomer mixture, and an effective amount of 

free-radical polymerization initiator; 
(b) maintaining the suspension under adiabatic 
conditions sufficient to polymerize the monomer 

mixture and obtain copolymer beads, the conditions 
including retention within the suspension of a 

substantial amount of exothermic heat evolved during 
polymerization of the monomers to copolymer such that 

the retention of the exothermic heat results in a rise 
in temperature of the suspension to at least 120°C for 

a time sufficient to polymerize at least 90 weight 
percent of the polymerizable monomer based on total 

weight of the monomer in the mixture; and 
(c) recovering the copolymer beads from the 
suspension. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
suspension reaches a temperature of at least 130°C. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the conditions include maintaining the suspension 

at an initial temperature of at least 40°C by applying heat 
from an external source until the exothermic heat evolved 

from polymerization of the monomer to copolymer is 
sufficient to at least maintain the polymerization without 

addition of heat to the suspension. 
A process as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the 
initial temperature is at least 70°C. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the free-radical initiator is selected from 

peroxide, peroxyesters, azo compounds, and mixtures 
thereof, and is present in an amount from 0.05 to 2.0 

weight percent based on the total weight of the monomer 
mixture. 
A process as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
free-radical initiator is selected from benzoyl peroxide, 

t-butyl peroctoate, t-butyl perbenzoate, and mixtures 
thereof. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the monomer mixture contains an inert 

diluent. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the monomer is imbibed into a seed polymer.  

 
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein a portion of the monomer is added to the 

polymerization as it proceeds. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the monomer mixture comprises styrene and 

divinylbenzene.
