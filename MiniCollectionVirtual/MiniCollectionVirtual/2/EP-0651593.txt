<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control 
device for an appliance consuming 

electric power, especially for the 
control of lighting or heating. The 

control element includes a sensor 
element (V8) for producing a control 

current or voltage as a result of a 
light or heat flux received thereby. 

An amplifier element (V4-V1) boosts 
the control current of said sensor 

element (V8) to a sufficient level 
for controlling one or a plurality of 

electronic ballasts, which is e.g. a 
current limiter for a discharge lamp, 

a regulator for a filament lamp or a 
heating effect regulator. The electric 

power required by the amplifier 
element (V4-V1) of the control device 

is supplied from said ballast by 
means of conductors, which also serve 

as a control line between the control 
device and the ballast.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control device for an appliance
consuming electric power, especially for the control
of lighting or heating, said control device including:
a sensor element for producing a control current as a result
of a sensed external effect, such as a light or heat
flux received thereby,an amplifier that boosts the control current of the sensor
element sufficiently in view of controlling one or a plurality
of electronic ballasts connected between a power
source and the appliance to be controlled, anda first transistor of the amplifier, whereby the electric
power required by the amplifier is supplied from said ballast
by means of supply voltage conductors connected between
the ballast and the control device said conductors
also serving as a control line between the control device
and the ballast.Said ballast can be e.g. a discharge lamp current limiter, a
filament lamp regulator, a halogen lamp regulator or voltage
converter or a heating effect regulator. However, a control
device of the invention can be applied to the control of all
types of electric appliances responding to some external effect,
such as light, heat, sound, pressure, acceleration or
the like, which is capable of producing a low control current 
in a transducer which is dependent on the influence of said
external effect.However, a primary application of the invention is the control
of lighting and, thus, the invention will be described
as a lighting control device hereinbelow.A 1 to 10 V analogue signal control has rapidly become popular
in adjustable electronic ballasts.The emergence of a direct control for ballasts has also led
to the increased use of light control systems in an effort to
stabilize the illumination level in an indoor space by means
of various light sensor-amplifier systems. Normally, this
type of system operates in such a manner that the light sensor
measures the illumination level of an object converting
it to a voltage level which is conformed to the control standard
(1-10 V) of ballasts by means of an amplifier unit. Some
of the light of a controlled illuminator or lighting fixture
flows back to the light sensor resulting in a feedback. The
light sensors are provided with a control for setting a desired
illumination level. The sensor increases or decreases
the control until a desired total amount of light is produced
by the lighting fixture and the light flux from outside and
received by the sensor. Thus, the illumination level of a
room can be stabilized at a desired level. The amplifiers
