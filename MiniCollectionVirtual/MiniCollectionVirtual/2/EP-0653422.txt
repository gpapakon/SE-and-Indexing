<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for the preparation of 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazole-4-carbaldehydes of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 is described. This entails a glycine ester hydrohalide being cyclised with an imidic ester to give a 2-substituted 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one, followed by conversion with N,N-substituted formamide acetal into the N,N-substituted aminomethyleneimidazolinone and, finally, chlorination. The 5-chloroimidazole-4-carbaldehydes are important intermediates in the preparation of drugs which lower blood pressure.

Process for the preparation of 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazole-4-carbaldehydes
of the general formula



where R is hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a
cycloalkyl group, or an aryl group or an arylalkyl group

which can be optionally substituted on the aromatic
nucleus, characterized in that a glycine ester

hydrohalide of the general formula

atom, is reacted, in a first step, with an imidic acid

ester of the general formula

 
wherein R has the above-mentioned meaning and R
2
 denotes
an alkyl group in the presence of a base to give the 2-substituted

give an N,N-substituted aminomethylene imidazolinone of

the general formula

 
where R, R
5
 and R
6
 have the above-mentioned meaning and
is finally chlorinated, in a third step, with phosphorus

oxychloride or phosgene and hydrolyzed to give the end
product.
