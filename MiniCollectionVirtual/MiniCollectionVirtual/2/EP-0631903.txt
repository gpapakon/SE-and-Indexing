<ABSTRACT>
A seat body (3) forming a backrest portion (2) is 
made arcuately movable with respect to a base (6) by a 

relative movement guiding mechanism (7) which is formed by 
combination of an arcuately extending guide rail (8) and a 

guide member (9) moving along the same. A seat portion 
(5) is rotatably mounted on the seat body (3) and a 

coupling member (30) is made to engage with a linear 
portion (11) of the guide rail (8), thereby maintaining 

the seat portion (5) in a substantially constant 
inclination regardless of movement of the seat body (3). 

Thus, it is possible to maintain the seat portion (5) in a 
substantially horizontal state also when the angle of the 

backrest portion (2) is adjusted, while making the 
backrest portion (2) reclinable without interfering with a 

backrest portion of an original seat provided in an 
automobile. Thus, a child is not forced into an 

uncomfortable position in an inclined state of the 
backrest portion (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a child safety seat 
for an automobile which is mountable on an original seat of 
an automobile for safely seating a child in the 
automobile and is provided with a reclining mechanism. The present invention also relates, more generally, to a 
reclining seat as set forth in independent claim 10. There is a child safety seat for an automobile which 
comprises a reclining mechanism for keeping a child in a 
comfortable position when it falls asleep on the seat, for 
example. Such a seat typically has a reclinable backrest 
portion. When this safety seat is mounted frontward on an 
original seat of the automobile and the angle of the 
backrest portion is adjusted, however, the backrest 
portion interferes with that of the original seat of the 
automobile. Therefore, the position for mounting the 
child safety seat on the original seat of the automobile 
must be changed every time the angle of the backrest 
portion is adjusted. In order to avoid such a trouble in 
adjustment of the angle of the backrest portion, there has 
been proposed a child safety seat for an automobile  
 
comprising a reclining mechanism having the following 
structure: This type of child safety seat comprises a base which 
is fixed to an original seat of an automobile, and a seat 
body which is movably held by the base. The base is 
provided with a guide rail arcuately extending in a 
vertical plane, while the seat body is provided with a 
guide member which is guided to move along the guide rail. 
Thus, it is possible to change the angle of inclination of 
the seat body without interfering with the original seat 
of the automobile. The aforementioned seat body is provided with 
backrest and seat portions in a fixed manner. When the 
seat body is inclined to adjust the angle of the backrest 
portion, therefore, a forward end of the seat portion is 
also raised up. In such a state, however, the knees of the child are 
drawn up to apply a relatively large load on its hips, 
although the child can recline the upper half of its body 
on the backrest portion.  
 DE-U-9201796 cited during the examination of this 
application discloses a child safety seat for an 
automobile, comprising: 
a backrest portion and a seat portion; a seat body forming said backrest portion; and a base movably holding said seat body, said base and said seat body being coupled with 
each other by a relative movement guiding mechanism 
being formed by combination of a guide rail having a 
portion arcuately extending in a vertical
