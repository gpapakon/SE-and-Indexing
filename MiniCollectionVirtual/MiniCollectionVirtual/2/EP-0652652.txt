<ABSTRACT>
In receiving the repeater monitoring signal multiplexed by superposition or wavelength multiplexing of the 
optical signal of the main line in an optical amplification repeat system, the received optical signal is photoelectrically 

converted by a photodetector and the electrical signal is divided into two. One of the electric signals is subjected to 
equalizing amplification, timing extraction and recognition reproduction so that only the signal component of the main 

tack is extracted. The waveform, phase, and amplitude between this extracted signal component and the signal of 
main line contained in the other signal which is not subjected to recognition reproduction are made to coincide with 

each other by executing the required equalization, delay adjustment and amplitude adjustment. An automatic control 
function is provided to the circuit for adjusting the amplitude of the signal of the main line so as to differentially 

combining the two signals. Thus, the main line signal component is so removed that the level of the remaining 
component is a minimum, and the desired repeater monitoring signal is extracted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for receiving a repeater supervisory signal which is
transmitted while being superimposed on a main optical
signal in an optical amplifier repeater system.To transmit an optical repeater supervisory signal in
an optical amplifier repeater system to the end office
side, there have been proposed the following systems which
superimpose the supervisory signal on the main optical
signal to such an extent as not to affect the main signal.
(1) System which superimposes the supervisory signal on
the envelope of the main optical signal with a low
modulation depth. (For example, Japanese Pat. Laid-Open
No. 119328/90, "Optical Repeater Supervisory Control
System")(2) System which superimposes the supervisory signal on
the main optical signal, using an optical signal of a
wavelength different from that of the main optical signal.The repeater supervisory signal is superimposed on the
main optical signal and the both signals are received
simultaneously; when the supervisory signal is received at
the end office, the main signal is also received.
Consequently, the signal spectrum of the supervisory signal
after photoelectric conversion overlaps the power spectrum
of the main signal, and since the supervisory signal is
superimposed on the main signal at such an extremely low
level as not to exert any influence on the main signal, the
main signal component becomes noise when the supervisory 
signal is received; hence, it is difficult to receive the supervisory signal with sufficient
signal power vs. noise power ratio (SNR).The inventors of this application has proposed a solution to this problem in
Japanese Pat. Appln. No. 337902/92, entitled "Supervisory Signal Receiving Method and
Apparatus." However, the method and apparatus proposed in the prior application are
defective in that the function of keeping the main signal component at minimum at all
times is somewhat poor.The document WO 92/11710 in the name of British Telecommunications plc
discloses an optical communication system in which low-level PRBS (pseudo-random
binary sequence) are pulses superimposed over system data. A correlator including a
code shift and stepping control, a digitally-stabilised analogue integrate and dump circuit,
a PRBS generator and an analogue multiplexer circuit produces an identical PRBS to that
superimposed but shifted in time which is used in combination with an incoming signal
allowing the PRBS signal to be located, separated from the system data and for level and
time delay of
