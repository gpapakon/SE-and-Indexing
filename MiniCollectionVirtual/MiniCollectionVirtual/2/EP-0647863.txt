<ABSTRACT>
Generally stated, the present invention is 
directed to a liquid light guide 10 for surgical 

instrumentation, which includes a flexible elongated tube 
12 having first 14 and second 16 end portions, first 24 

and second 26 light transmissive members disposed at 
respective first and second end portions of the elongated 

tube to substantially seal an interior portion of the 
elongated tube and a light transmissive medium 22 filing 

the interior portion of the elongated tube. The preferred 
light transmissive medium comprises a heavy mineral oil 

having a specific gravity greater than or equal to about 
0.86. Preferred light transmissive members are drawn 

glass rods having polished ends and an index of refraction 
substantially equal to the transmissive medium. 
The liquid light guide of the present invention 
is capable of providing nearly 100% light transmission 

over the entire visible spectral range while substantially 
reducing undesired transmission of infrared and 

ultraviolet radiation. The light guide is contemplated to 
be used with an endoscope and is cost-effective to 

manufacture such that the light guide may be disposed of 
after a single use. Methods of making and using the 

disposable light guide also are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to light 
guides for transferring illuminating light from a light 
source to surgical instrumentation, and, more particularly, 
to a flexible liquid light guide for transmitting light in 
the visible spectral range to an endoscope. In endoscopic surgical procedures, illuminating 
light is typically transmitted from an external light 
source to an endoscope where the light is then transmitted 
via an illuminating system incorporated within the 
endoscope to the body cavity to be viewed. A conventional 
light cable for providing the endoscope with illumination 
is a fiber optic light bundle having a plurality of optical 
fibers of glass or optical plastic. The fiber optic bundle 
is connected at one end to the light source and at the 
other end to an inlet port of the endoscope. This system 
is typically referred to as a fiber optic light guide. A significant drawback of fiber optic light 
guides concerns their degradation when used over a period 
of time. Such degradation is due in part to the repetitive 
flexing the light guide undergoes when the bundle is 
initially connected to the light source and the endoscope, 
and during maneuvering about the operative site in the 
course of the surgical procedure. Since fiber optic light 
guides are relatively expensive and are intended to be 
reused, the light guides are typically employed in many 
surgical procedures over a substantial period of time. 
Consequently, the light transferring quality of the fiber 
optic light guide tends to gradually degrade to a point 
where the level of light emitted by the fiber optic bundle 
is substantially less than the light initially received 
from the light source. One attempted solution to this problem has been  
 
to substitute liquids for fiber optic bundles. Examples of 
such liquid light guides are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
3,740,113; 3,920,980; 3,995,934; 4,045,119; 4,907,133 and 
5,165,773. However, these liquid light guides are subject 
to their own drawbacks and limitations. In particular, the 
liquids described and suggested in these patents provide an 
inferior degree of visible light transmission when compared 
with convention fiber optic light guides. In addition, 
many of the liquids described are not biocompatible and are 
not favored for use in a surgical apparatus. Further, the 
construction of such known light guides entails significant 
expense thereby precluding disposal of the light guides 
after a single use. Consequently, as in conventional fiber 
optic
