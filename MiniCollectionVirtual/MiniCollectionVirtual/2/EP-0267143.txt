<ABSTRACT>
A powder mixture for applying gas phase 
aluminide coatings to nickel or cobalt base 

superalloys is described. A preferred mixture 
consists essentially of Co₂Al₅, NH₄F.HF, and 

chromium metal. The mixture is substantially free 
of aluminum oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for forming a gas phase 
aluminide coating on a nickel or cobalt base superalloy article. Aluminide coatings provide protection against 
oxidation and corrosion degradation to nickel and 
cobalt base superalloy articles used in gas turbine 
engines. U.S. Patents which are indicative of the 
skill in the art relative to aluminide coatings 
include the following: 3,079,276, 3,276,903, 
3,667,985, 3,801,353, 3,837,901, 3,958,047, 
4,132,816, 4,142,023, 4,148,275 and 4,332,843. In 
general, aluminide coatings are formed by heating a 
powder mixture containing a source of aluminum, an 
activator, and an inert buffer or diluent, in the 
presence of the article to be coated. The article 
may either be embedded in the powder mixture (and 
the process is termed a "pack cementation" process) 
or the article is suspended in out-of-contact 
relation with the powder mixture (and the process is 
termed a "vapor phase" process). The source of aluminum may be pure aluminum 
metal or it may be an alloy or intermetallic 
containing aluminum, such as Co₂Al₅, as disclosed in US-A-4,132,816 
to Benden et al.; US-A-3,958,047 
to Baldi discloses the use of 
Ni₃Al as the source of aluminum; and US-A-4,332,843  
 
to Ahuja discloses the use of Fe₂Al₅. 
Activators which have been used in the aluminiding 
process generally include halides of alkali or 
alkaline earth metals. See, e.g., the 
aforementioned patent to Benden. Aluminum oxide is 
the typical diluent added to the powder mixture and 
controls the aluminum activity of the mixture. 
Aluminum oxide also prevents the powder mixture from 
sintering together during the coating process, as 
discussed in US-A-3,667,985 to Levine et 
al.  
 FR-A-1433672 discloses a method of forming an aluminide diffusion 
coating on a Ni-Co based superalloy article by heating the same in non 
oxidant atmosphere within a powder mixture containing a diffusing 
metallic material, an activator and a constituent capable of 
controlling and inhibiting the transfer of the metallic material from 
the powder mixture.  
 Three problems which have been prevalent, 
especially in the gas phase aluminiding processes, 
are the formation of cryolite, Na₃AlF₆, on the 
surface of the coated article; the aggregation of 
"zipper oxides" on the original substrate surface; 
and the formation of oxides within the coating 
itself. Cryolite has been found to accelerate the 
rate of base metal degradation. While cryolite 
formation can sometimes be limited by using special 
alumini
