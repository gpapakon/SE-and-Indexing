<ABSTRACT>
In an image forming apparatus, a charging member, 
image transfer member or similar contact member contacts 

an image carrier implemented as a photoconductive element. 
Even when a voltage is applied to the contact member in a 

relatively low temperature environment, the contact member 
is provided with an adequate charge potential or an image 

transfer potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
image forming apparatus having a charging member, image
transfer member or similar contact member which is applied
with a voltage in contact with a photoconductive element or
similar image carrier with or without the intermediary of a
paper.Generally, an image forming apparatus of the type
described, e.g., a facsimile apparatus or a printer includes a
charging device for charging a photoconductive element, or
image carrier, and an image transfer device for transferring a
toner image from the photoconductive element to a paper. The
charging device and image transfer device have often been
implemented by a corona discharger having a discharge wire
made of tungsten and not contacting the object to be charged.
The charging device implemented by a corona discharger has
the following problems.
(1) A voltage as high as 4 kV to 8 kV has to be applied to
the discharge wire in order to deposit a charge potential of
500 V to 800 V on the photoconductive element.  (2) Since most of the current from the discharge wire
flows into a shield, only several percent of the total
discharge current is available for charging the surface of the
photoconductive element to the predetermined potential,
obstructing efficient use of power.(3) Corona discharge ionizes the air and generates a
great amount of ozone, nitrogen oxides and other harmful
substances. To prevent such substances from deteriorating
the parts of the apparatus and the surface of the
photoconductive element, the apparatus has to be provided
with an ozone filter, a fan for generating a stream of air, etc.(4) Images are apt to become irregular due to the
contamination of the discharge wire.In light of the above, there has been proposed a charging
device having a charge roller or similar charging member
which charges the photoconductive element in contact
therewith when applied with a voltage. Such a non-contact
type charging device is advantageous over the above-stated
contact type device, as follows. The device reduces the
voltage necessary for the predetermined charge potential to
be deposited on the surface of the photoconductive element.
The device produces a minimum of ozone during the course of
charging and, therefore, eliminates the need for an ozone
filter while simplifying an exhaust arrangement. However, the problem with the contact-type charging
device is that the charging efficiency, i.e., a ratio of the
charge potential to the applied voltage changes with a change
in the surface temperature of the
