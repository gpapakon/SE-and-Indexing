<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to information
storage media having magnetic data tracks and optical servo
tracks, and more particularly, the present invention relates
to an apparatus for etching the optical servo
tracks onto the magnetic medium and for verifying the etching
of the optical servo tracks. It also relates to a method for verifying the etching.So-called "floppy" disk memory systems for "desk
top" sized computers are well known in the art. Such systems
employ magnetic storage disks having a diameter of either
5.25 inches or 3.50 inches. Conventional magnetic storage
disks for floppy disk drives have a track density ranging
from forty-eight (48) to one hundred thirty-five (135) tracks
per inch (TPI) (i.e., 1,9 to 5,3 tracks/mm). In contrast, optical storage disks for
optical memory systems achieve track densities greater than
15,000 TPI (590 tracks/mm). The greater track density of optical disks is
achieved by the use of optical servos that maintain fine
positioning of the optical read\write head over the data
tracks on the disk. Typically, concentric optical servo
tracks are pre-recorded on the optical disk to guide the
servo mechanism.New advances in barium-ferrite magnetic media have
allowed bit densities of magnetic storage disks to exceed the
bit densities of optical disks. However, as mentioned above, 
track densities of magnetic media (48 - 135 TPI) are many
times less than their optical counterparts. This limits the
overall capacity of magnetic disks as compared to optical
disks. Conventional magnetic disk systems employ a magnetic
servo mechanism and magnetically pre-recorded servo tracks on
the disks to guide the read\write head. Magnetic servo
systems cannot provide the fine positioning that optical
servo systems can provide.Recently, floppy disk systems have been developed
that combine magnetic disk recording techniques with the high
track capacity optical servos found in optical disk systems.
Such a system is described in AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INSITE
325 FLOPTICAL(R) DISK DRIVE, Godwin, in a paper presented at
the SPIE Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting (1989).
Essentially, an optical servo pattern is pre-recorded on a
magnetic floppy disk. The optical servo pattern typically
consists of a large number of equally spaced concentric
tracks about the rotational axis of the disk. Data is stored
in the magnetic "tracks" between the optical servo tracks
using conventional magnetic recording techniques. An optical
servo mechanism is provided to guide the magnetic read\write
head
