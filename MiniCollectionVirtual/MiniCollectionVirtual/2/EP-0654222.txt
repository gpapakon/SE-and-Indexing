<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for continuous tempering of in 
particular a chocolate mass which passes through a cooling 

zone (A) having a final crystal formation area (K) and a 
subsequent reheating zone (G). The cooling medium flow, 

which overflows the crystal formation area (K), is controlled 
in response to measured values of the temperature 

of the chocolate mass at the crystal formation area. This 
ensures that the heat energy transport from the chocolate 

mass is continuously adapted to the instantaneous requirement, 
irrespective of the inlet temperature of the mass 

and the flowing chocolate mass amount per unit of time. It 
is hereby surprisingly possible to make a tempered chocolate 

mass having a predetermined constant content of 
stable beta crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of continuously tempering
a flowing cocoa butter or other fat containing chocolate-like
mass which passes through a cooling zone having a
plurality of cooling surfaces and a subsequent reheating
zone having a plurality of heating surfaces for the chocolate
mass, seen in the flow direction of said mass, said
cooling surfaces being overflown by at least two separately
circulating cooling media, one of which exclusively
overflows a final crystal formation area for the chocolate
mass in the cooling zone, said heating surfaces being
overflown by at least one separately circulating heating
medium.The invention moreover concerns an apparatus for use in
the performance of the method of the invention, said apparatus
comprising a cooling zone having a plurality of
cooling surfaces and a subsequent reheating zone having a
plurality of heating surfaces for the chocolate mass, seen
in the flow direction of said mass, said cooling surfaces
being overflown by cooling medium which flows in its respective
one of at least two separately circulating cooling
circuits, and the cooling medium in one cooling circuit
comprising separate pumping means exclusively overflows
a final crystal formation area for the chocolate
mass in the cooling zone, said heating surfaces being
overflown by heating medium which flows in at least one
separately circulating heating circuit, each of said separately
circulating cooling and heating circuits comprising
a heating member and a valve for controlling external cold
medium supply to the circuit for controlled regulation of
the cooling or heating medium temperature of the circuit
concerned, said apparatus moreover comprising at least one 
temperature sensor which is arranged in the chocolate mass
at the crystal formation area and is connected to an electronic
control unit.The known tempering devices of the type mentioned above
are built and dimensioned to obtain "optimum" tempering of
the chocolate-like mass at nominal capacity, i.e. at a
predetermined chocolate flow.Large amounts of constantly flowing cooling and heating
medium circulate in the separate cooling and heating circuits
of the devices under stable operating conditions.
Thus, the circulating cooling and heating medium amount is
adapted to discharge and supply the necessary heat energy
amount from and to the chocolate mass to achieve the desired
temperature and thus presumed optimum state of the
chocolate mass at a nominal capacity.In other words, at the nominal capacity of the tempering
apparatus the
