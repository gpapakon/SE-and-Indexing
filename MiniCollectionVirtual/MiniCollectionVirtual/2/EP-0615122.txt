A method for continuously monitoring the rehydration 
kinetics of insoluble dehydrated products, characterized 

in that the dehydrated products are immersed in water and 
the variation in the force applied to the pan (15) of a 

balance (16) by the combination of the product and the water 
of rehydration contained in an enclosure is monitored as 

a function of time. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the insoluble dehydrated products are vegetables, 

fruits, pastas or rice. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it is carried out at a temperature of 20 to 90Â°C. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that it is carried out over a period of 30 

seconds to 24 hours. 
An arrangement for carrying out the method claimed 
in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it comprises 

suspension means (14) fixed to the pan (15) of a balance (16) and 
a system for holding the dehydrated products comprising 

a cage (2) formed with openings (3) to allow the water to pass 
through, but to keep the air inside and a cover (4) for the 

cage (2) surmounted by a hollow rod (5) designed to engage with 
the means mentioned above. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the balance (16) is connected to a data acquisition 

system (17). 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the interior of the cover (4) of the cage (2) 

comprises a grill (6). 
An arrangement as claimed in any of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that the interior of the rod (5) comprises 

a closure cone (7) fixed to a spring (9). 
An arrangement as claimed in any of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that it comprises a system for controlling 

the rehydration temperature (23).
