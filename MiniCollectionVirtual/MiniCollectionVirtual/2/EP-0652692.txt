<CLAIMS>
Method for mounting a component (10) which is
provided with connecting pins (12, 11) on its top and

bottom, for example a laser, on a base printed circuit
board (13), the component (10) being directly connected

via its lower connecting pins (11) to the base printed
circuit board (13), characterized in that the upper

connecting pins (12) are connected to the base printed
circuit board (13) by a pre-bent flexible printed circuit

(14) which is made of a composite material composed of an
epoxy resin and a glass-fibre fabric, the printed circuit

(14) having a copper coating on both sides which is
designed such that, on the outside, it either covers the

entire area or is in the form of copper tracks (17) and,
on the inside, is in the form of copper tracks.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a printed circuit (14) is used in which the copper

tracks (17) run transversely with respect to the bending
axis (18).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
by the use of a printed circuit (14) made of a composite

material which is about 0.2 mm thick and is provided on
both sides with a copper coating of about 70 Âµm.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that a printed circuit is used i
n which at
least about 75% of the bending zone is covered with

copper.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized by the use of a printed circuit (14) which

has a bending radius (R) that does not damage the glass-resin 
composite.
