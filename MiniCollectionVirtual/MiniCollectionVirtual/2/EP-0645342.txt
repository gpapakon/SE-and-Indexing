<ABSTRACT>
A spear valve assembly (5) has a valve body 
(14) for engagement with a keg neck (3) and a 

skirt (17) on the valve body (14) including 
openings (18) for the throughflow of beer during 

filling. A downtube assembly (12) is movable 
relative to the valve body (14) and the skirt (17) 

and includes a downtube (12) for projecting into 
beer in a keg. A locking member (7) is carried by 

the downtube assembly (12) and is arranged to 
project through at least one further opening (19) 

in the skirt. In use, the locking member (7) 
normally prevents the spear valve assembly (5) 

from being ejected from a beer keg by engagement 
behind the keg neck. However, for removal of the 

spear valve assembly (5) the downtube assembly 
(12) is tilted relative to the skirt (17) to 

retract the locking element (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a delivery device 
for delivering a liquid from a container to a 
dispenser, particularly for delivering beer from a 
keg, and to a safety device therefor. In our European publication No. 0493976 we 
have disclosed a safety device, suitable for 
fitting to a keg spear valve, comprising at least 
one locking member which, when fitted, is movable 
relative to the spear valve whereby the keg spear 
valve may be inserted into a keg neck without 
disassembly, the locking member, during insertion 
and once through the keg neck, moving outwardly 
relative to the spear valve so that the locking 
member will prevent the spear valve from being 
ejected from the beer keg by residual pressure by 
engagement behind the keg neck. In several embodiments in that application 
the safety device comprises a separate element 
which projects through an opening in a skirt on 
the valve sleeve and which is biassed outwardly so 
that the projecting portion projects through the 
opening after insertion through the keg neck so as 
to engage behind the neck on unintentional 
pressurized release. However, whilst the arrangements of our 
aforementioned applications work satisfactorily, 
there may be a problem when it comes to servicing 
of the spear valve. In particular, in those  
 
embodiments where the safety device comprises 
small separate locking pieces the locking pieces 
are liable to fall away from the skirt on 
disassembly of the spear valve for cleaning and 
seal replacement. This is likely to lead to the 
loss of locking pieces or at least the 
inconvenience of re-fitting the locking piece in 
the skirt. An object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved safety device. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a spear valve assembly for insertion into 
the neck of a beer keg including a body having a 
skirt portion with at least one opening therein 
and a downtube assembly, and a locking member 
carried by the downtube assembly which, after 
insertion of the spear valve into the keg neck, 
projects through the at least one opening and 
prevents the spear valve from being blown out of 
the keg by engagement behind the keg neck, the 
spear valve assembly only being removable from the 
neck of the beer keg by tilting the downtube 
assembly relative to the skirt to displace the 
locking element laterally whereby the locking 
element may clear the keg neck. The locking 
member is preferably a one-piece safety device 
including an annular portion which locates about 
the

A spear valve assembly (5) for insertion 
into the neck (3) of a beer keg comprising a body 

(14) having a skirt portion (17) with at least one 
opening (19) therein and a downtube assembly (12), 

and a locking member (7) carried by the downtube 
assembly (12) which, after insertion of the spear 

valve into the keg neck, projects through the at 
least one opening (19) and prevents the spear 

valve from being blown out of the keg by 
engagement behind the keg neck, the spear valve 

assembly (5) only being removable from the neck 
(3) of the beer keg by tilting the downtube 

assembly (12) relative to the skirt (17) to 
displace the locking element (7) laterally whereby 

the locking element (7) may clear the keg neck. 
A spear valve assembly according to claim 
1, wherein the piece safety device including an 

annular portion (25) which locates about the 
downtube assembly (12) and at least one projection 

(26) which extends through the at least one 
opening (19) in the skirt (17). 
A spear valve assembly according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein the locking element (7) includes 

two projections (26) which normally project 
through corresponding slots (19) in the skirt 

(17). 
A spear valve assembly (5) comprising a 
 

valve body (14) for engagement with a keg neck 
(3), a skirt (17) on the valve body (14) including 

openings (18) for the throughflow of beer during 
filling and at least one further opening (19), a 

downtube assembly (12) movable relative to the 
valve body (5) and skirt (17) and including a 

downtube for projecting into beer in a keg, a 
valve (27) co-operable with the valve body (5) to 

close the keg, and spring means (6) acting between 
a reaction member (24) on the downtube (12) and 

the valve (27) biassing the valve (27) into its 
closed position, and a locking member (7) carried 

by the downtube assembly (12) so as to project 
through the at least one further opening (19), in 

use, the locking member preventing the spear valve 
assembly (5) from being ejected from a beer keg by 

engagement behind the keg neck, the spear valve 
assembly (5) being removed from the beer keg by 

tilting the downtube assembly (12) relative to the 
skirt (17) to retract the locking member (7). 
A spear valve assembly according to claim 
4, wherein the locking member (7) comprises two 

juxtaposed projections which project through slots 
(19) in the skirt (17). 
A method of converting a keg spear into a 
safety keg spear to prevent the spear being 

ejected on unintentional pressurized release, the 
spear (5) including a valve body (14) for 

 
engagement with the keg neck (3), a downtube 

assembly (12) for projecting into beer in a keg 
and a valve for controlling fluid flow through the 

spear, and a skirt (17) on the valve body (14) 
including openings (18) for the throughflow of 

beer during filling, the method comprising: 
   forming at least one further opening (19) in 

the skirt (17) and fitting a locking device (7) to 
the downtube assembly (12) so that a projecting 

portion of the locking device projects through the 
at least one further opening (19) after insertion 

through the keg neck so as to engage behind the 
neck on unintentional pressurized release. 
A method according to claim 6, wherein 
the spear valve assembly (5) may be removed from 

the keg neck by providing a release tool (20) 
locating the release tool (20) within the downtube 

assembly (12) and tilting the downtube assembly 
(12) relative to the valve body (14) to retract 

the locking device from the at least one further 
opening (19) allowing the locking element to clear 

the keg neck and thereby permit the spear valve 
assembly to be removed from the keg.
