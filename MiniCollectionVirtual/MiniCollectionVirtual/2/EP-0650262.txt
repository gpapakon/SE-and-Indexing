<ABSTRACT>
A low bit rate encoder adapted for compression-encoding digital audio signals of a 
plurality of channels (Ch1 ... Chn) by making use of both the property of the audio 

signal and the hearing sense of the human being, the encoder comprising: an energy 
detecting section (200) for detecting energies of the digital audio signals every digital 

audio signals of the respective channel; a bit allocation amount determining section 
(500) for determining bit allocation amounts to the respective channels on the basis of 

the detected result; a compression-encoding section (400) for compression-encoding the 
digital audio signals on the basis of the bit allocation amounts allocated every respective 

channels in accordance with the determined bit allocation amounts; and a multiplexing 
section (600) for multiplexing the compression-encoded signals every respective 

channels, the bit allocation amount determining means (500) being operative to 
determine bit allocation amounts so that the relationship between the energy and the bit 

allocation amount of the digital audio signal represents a non-linear characteristic such 
that according as energy of the digital audio signal increases, the bit allocation amount 

increases as a whole. Thus, redundancy of bit allocation amount in compression-encoding 
of the multi-channel system is eliminated, and high quality compression 

encoding/decoding can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low bit rate encoder and a
low bit rate encoding method for compression-encoding audio
signals of a multi-channel system, which are used for cinema
film projection systems or stereo or multi-sound acoustic
systems such as a video tape recorder or a video disc
player, etc.From IEEE 1993 International Conference on Consumer
Electronics, vol. 39, no. 3, August 1993 NY, USA, p. 356 to
363, Fuma et al "A single chip decompression LSI based on
ATRAC for mini disc, is known an encoding method and an
encoder for a single channel. The ATRAC system is discussed
below.Although WO-A-9309645 and US-A-4713776 disclose encoding for
a plurality of channels and bit allocation assigning bits in
accordance with the levels of two signals, the problems
discussed below cannot be overcome.Various efficient encoding techniques and devices for
audio or speech signals, etc. are known.As a example of the efficient encoding technique, there
is a blocking frequency band division system, which is so
called transform coding, for blocking, e.g., an audio
signal, etc. in the time region every time unit to transform
signals on the time base every blocks into signals on the
frequency base (orthogonal transform) thereafter to divide
them into signal components in a plurality of frequency
bands to encode those signal components every respective
frequency bands.Moreover, there can be enumerated sub-band coding (SBC) 
which is non-blocking frequency band division system in which an
audio signal, etc. in the time region is divided into signal
components in a plurality of frequency bands without blocking it
every unit time thereafter to encode them.Further, there have been proposed efficient coding
techniques and devices in which the sub-band coding and the
transform coding described above are combined. In this case,
e.g., an input signal is divided into signal components in a
plurality of frequency bands by the sub-band coding thereafter
to orthogonally transform signals every respective frequency
bands into signals in the frequency region to implement coding
to these orthogonally transformed signal components in the
frequency region.Here, as a filter for frequency band division of the
above-described sub-band coding, there is, e.g., a filter of QMF,
etc. Such filter is described in, e.g., the literature "Digital
coding of speech in subbands" R.E.Crochiere, Bell Syst. Tech. J.,
Vol. 55, No. 8, 1976. This filter of QMF serves to halve the
frequency band into bands of equal bandwidth. This filter is
