<ABSTRACT>
Inflating a fighter-pilot's anti-G suit to the correct pressure is 
facilitated by the pressure regulator 

design. Using Preview Control, the movement of the control stick is 
used to predict what the 

G-force on the aircraft will be in the time ahead. A computer 
determines what pressure is 

needed in the suit to safeguard the pilot at that G-force. The size of 
the air-flow aperture in the 

regulator is defined by overlapping windows (30,32) in the housing and 
rotor of the regulator. The rotor 

is moved to give the correct overlap by means of a servo motor 
or stepper motor (38), which 

positions the rotor in response to the computer output. The very fast, 
stable, response of the 

regulator to the computer input enables the suit pressure to follow the 
G-forces predicted by 

Preview Control with great accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anti-G suits, of the kind used by pilots in high performance aircraft. A modern fighter aircraft is capable, as a structure, of withstanding the forces associated with 
carrying out manoeuvres up to about 15-G. However, even with the best of conventional 
precautions to protect the pilot, the pilot undergoes such physiological problems as blacking out 
at about 10-G. Under normal conditions, the pilot starts to suffer G-force-related problems at 6- or 
7-G. It is conventional practice to equip a fighter pilot with an anti-G suit, in which inflatable bladders 
are secured around the pilot's legs. A sensor senses the G-force on the aircraft, and inflates the 
bladders to an appropriate pressure. The pressurised bladders serve to prevent blood pooling in 
the pilot's feet, whereby the blood is prevented from draining from the brain, and causing 
blackout and the other physiological problems. Conventional anti-G suits add about 1-G to the 
pilot's tolerance of G-forces. The designer of the anti-G suit is faced with the following considerations. A first problem is that, 
if the suit is inflated /deflated too slowly, the suit might actually harm the pilot, by trapping blood 
in the lower extremities. A second problem is that the suit should not, for physiological reasons, be pre-inflated to a 
pressure higher than that dictated by the G-force, for more than a few moments, since that might 
seriously affect the pilot's blood pressure, and hence his capability/ comfort level. A third consideration is that it takes about half a second to one second, after the pilot has 
actuated the control stick to call for a change in G-force, for the G-force actually to come onto 
the aircraft. It takes the conventional anti-G suit and pressure regulation device about another 
half-second to a second to inflate the suit to the correct pressure as dictated by the new G-force 
on the aircraft. This speed of response is only acceptable if the aircraft changes G-force slowly, 
and if a second change in G-force is not commenced until the first change has been completed, 
and the suit inflated. Of course, in a fighter aircraft, the pilot may be changing his demands of 
the aircraft several times a second. It may be noted that there are two components to the time it takes to effect a change in the 
pressure in the suit. First, the pressure regulator has to be reset so as to admit a flow of air 
into, or out of, the suit; in particular, in the regulator, the size of the aperture or orifice through 
which air
