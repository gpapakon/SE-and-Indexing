<ABSTRACT>
To achieve high precision measurement of mass flow rate by 
equalising the output amplitude values of upstream and downstream 

sensors without causing a lowering of the mechanical Q of the 
vibrating system , in a Coriolis type mass flow meter, one of the 

upstream and downstream sensors comprises a permanent magnet 2 
mounted on a tube 15 and an induction coil 75, mounted on a base 3, 

the output voltage amplitude of the induction coil 75 being fixed. 
Another sensor comprises a ferromagnetic member 72 mounted on the 

tube 15 and a pair formed by an excitation coil 70 and an induction 
coil 71 mounted on the base 3. The output voltage amplitude of the 

induction coil 71 is controlled to be coincident with the output 
voltage amplitude of the induction coil 75 by adjusting a DC current 

flowing through the excitation coil 70.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Coriolis type mass flow 
meter which measures mass flow rate of a fluid by detecting phase 
difference between vibrations on the up and down stream sides of a 
tube, through which the fluid flows, which are excited by the 
Coriolis force which depends on the mass and velocity of the fluid. Figure 8 explains the operational principle of a general 
Coriolis type mass flow meter. In Figure 8, reference numeral 1 designates a U-shaped tube 
through which a fluid to be measured flows. A permanent magnet 2 is 
fixed to the bottom portion of the U-shaped tube 1. Both ends of the 
U-shaped tube 1 are fixed to a base 3. Reference numeral 4 
designates an electromagnetic drive coil which is disposed in a 
manner such that the drive coil 4 sandwiches the tube 1, and a 
support frame 5 tightly fixed to the base 3 for supporting the drive 
coil 4. The U-shaped tube 1 has its vibration nodes at the portions 
fixed to the base 3 and a structure like a tuning fork which 
minimises vibration energy loss. Reference numerals 11 and 12 
designate electromagnetic pickups for detecting displacement of both 
arms of the U-shaped tube 1. The Coriolis force is generated in the 
fluid flowing through the U-shaped tube 1 by vibrating the tube 1 at 
its normal frequency ω by an electromagnetic force acting between the 
drive coil 4 and the permanent magnet 2 fixed to the tube 1 and 
opposed to the drive coil 4. Figure 9 shows a vibration mode of the U-shaped tube 1. The strength of the Coriolis force is proportional to the 
mass and velocity of the fluid flowing through the tube 1, and its 
direction coincides with the direction of the vector product of the 
direction of motion of the fluid and the angular velocity at which 
the tube 1 is vibrated. Since the directions of motion of the fluid 
are opposite to each other on the inlet and outlet sides of the 
U-shaped tube 1, the Coriolis forces act in the opposite directions 
on both arms of the U-shaped tube 1 to generate a torsional torque in  
 
the U-shaped tube 1. The torsional torque changes at the same 
frequency with the excitation frequency at which the tube 1 is 
vibrated and its amplitude value is proportional to the mass flow 
rate of the fluid. Figure 10 shows the vibration mode excited by the 
torsional torque. The mass flow rate of the fluid can be measured by detecting 
torque amplitude of the torsional vibration with the pickups 11 and 
12. Since, in an actual vibration of the U-shaped tube 1, the 
torsional vibration by the
