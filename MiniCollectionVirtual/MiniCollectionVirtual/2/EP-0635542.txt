<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber reinforced
thermoplastic resin structure controlled in the degree of
combing of the reinforcing fibers and fiber length and
superior in shapeability (or moldability), mechanical
properties, and surface smoothness and a process for
production of the same having a high productivity. More
particularly, it relates to fiber reinforced thermoplastic
resin pellets suitable for making automobile cylinder head
covers, bumper beams, seat frames, instrument panels, wheel
caps, battery trays, etc., office automation equipment and
home appliance chassis, housings, etc., and further tool
housings and fiber reinforced thermoplastic sheets suited
for extrudates, blow molded products, tubes, pipes, and
sheets, for further hot molding use sheets.Fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin structures are
used for various types of applications, such as auto parts
and parts for office automation equipment, making use of
their superior mechanical properties. A review entitled
"Strength Predictions of Injection Molding Compounds" by
P.A. Templeton for the 42nd Annual Conference, Composites
Institute, The society of the Plastics Industry Inc 19-D/1
to 19-D/8 (1987) concerns the tensile strengths of fiber
reinforced injection molding compounds, for which chopped
strand fiberglass is used.Studies are also underway for increasing the length of the
reinforcing fibers so as to improve mechanical properties
etc. For example, in the case of fiber reinforced
thermoplastic pellets, as shown in Japanese Examined Patent
Publication (Kokoku) No. 41-20738, in a method for
extruding a chopped strand using an extruder, the
reinforcing fibers end up breaking and therefore good
mechanical properties cannot be exhibited.
Accordingly, studies have been pursued so as to increase 
the fiber length of the reinforcing fibers so as to
improve the mechanical properties etc. As shown in
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 63-37694,
a roving of reinforcing fiber connected by the
pultrusion method is covered with a plastic and cut into
predetermined lengths to form pellets. Further, there are
also known pellets with uniformly dispersed reinforcing
fibers of a fiber length of 3 to 20 mm obtained by the
paper machine process and the dry nonwoven fabric process
as shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 3-7307 and pellets obtained by mixing a resin
powder and glass fibers in advance in a Henschel mixer
etc. and then melting in a ram extruder as shown in
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
