<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory
element using an artificial lattice magnetoresistance film
defined by the precharacterizing features of claim 1
and known from the US-A-3 531 780.Heretofore, developments of magnetoresistance
sensors (hereinafter, called as MR sensor) and
magnetoresistance heads (hereinafter, called as MR head)
have been pursued. As the magnetic materials, mainly
permalloy such as Ni0.8Fe0.2 and the likes have been used.
In case of using these materials, magnetoresistance
variation ratio, MR ratio (hereinafter often denoted as
ΔR/R), is about 2.5 %. Then, in order to obtain a
magnetoresistance material of higher sensitivity,
materials having larger values of ΔR/R are tried to be
sought. In recent years, it has been found that giant
magnetoresistance effects are obtainable in
antiferromagnetically coupled [Fe/Cr] or [Co/Ru]
artificial lattice films (Physical Review Letters, vol.61,
p.2472, 1988; ditto, vol.64, p.2304, 1990). And the giant
magnetoresistance effect was also found in [Ni-Fe/Cu/Co]
artificial lattice film using a magnetic thin film Ni-Fe
and Co which were separated by a metallic nonmagnetic thin
film Cu and were not magnetically coupled, and one having 
a ΔR/R of 10 % under an applied magnetic field of 3 kOe
at room temperature was obtained (Journal of Physical
Society of Japan vol.59, p.3061, 1990). Furthermore, the
giant magnetoresistance effect was also found in [Ni-Fe-Co/Cu/Co]
or [Ni-Fe-Co/Cu] artificial lattice film using a
magnetic thin film of Ni-Fe-Co or of Co which was coupled
antiferromagnetically through a metallic nonmagnetic thin
film Cu. And one having a ΔR/R of 10 % under an applied
magnetic field of 3 kOe at room temperature was obtained
(The Institute of Electronics, Information and
Communication Engineers, Technical Research Report, MR91-9).
However, as for the application of these metallic
artificial lattice films, heretofore, only magnetic
sensors and magnetic heads were pursued.Object of the present invention is to constitute
a magnetic thin film memory element using an artificial
lattice magnetoresistance effect film as described above
for the information data readout. When the above-mentioned
metallic artificial lattice film is used for the
purpose of the information data readout, if we intend to
obtain such a large ΔR/R effect by [Fe/Cr] or [Co/Ru], a
large applied magnetic field is required. Therefore, it
is not suited to actual applications. Although the use of
conventional magnetoresistance materials such as
Ni0.8Fe0.2 can make the
