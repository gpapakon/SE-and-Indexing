<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display
device of high picture quality with substantially
eliminated residual image.In prior art liquid crystal display devices, two opposite
transparent electrodes formed on the two substrates
were used as electrodes for driving the liquid crystal
layer. In accordance therewith, a display method based on
the twisted nematic display has been adopted, wherein the
liquid crystal display is operated by applying an electric
field approximately in vertical direction to the substrate
boundary planes. On the other hand, there has been known a
method wherein the direction of the electric field is approximately
parallel to the substrates; in this method, a
pair of comb-like electrodes is used as disclosed, for
example, in JP-B-63-21907 and WO91/10936 or US-A-4 345 249. In these cases, 
the electrodes are not necessarily transparent, and opaque
metallic electrodes having high conductivity are used.
However, the above prior art is silent about the liquid
crystal material, the orienting film and the insulating
film, which are necessary for obtaining a high picture
quality when driving the display system, wherein the electric
field is supplied to the liquid crystal in an approximately
parallel direction to the substrate plane (hereinafter
called in-plane switching system), with active matrix
driving or simple matrix driving.When a character or a drawing is displayed in the display
plane, the image of the character or the drawing
remains for a while in the display plane even after erasing,
and sometimes it causes an uneven display called afterimage.
The afterimage is a common problem which leads to insufficient
image quality both for display methods wherein the
electric field is supplied in perpendicular direction or the
in-plane switching system. Especially, in the case of the
in-plane switching system, the afterimage effect occurs more
easily than in cases wherein the applied electric field is
perpendicular to the substrate plane.It is the object of the present invention to provide a
liquid crystal display device of high picture quality with
substantially eliminated residual image. The above object is achieved according to claim 1; the
dependent claims relate to preferred embodiments.The liquid crystal display device of the present invention

device of in-plane switching type comprises:
