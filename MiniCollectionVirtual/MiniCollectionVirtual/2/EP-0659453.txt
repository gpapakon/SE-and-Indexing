<ABSTRACT>
The stand has 
a loading device (2) which is mounted on a frame (1) 

supporting a rear wheel (B) of a bicycle (90). The loading 
device (2) includes a resistance generator (48) which has a 

rotary shaft (49) connected to a drive drum (46) urged against 
a tire (91) of the rear wheel (B). The drive drum (46) has 

an outer diameter so that the drum (46) is able to contact a 
plurality of block typed tread patterns adjacently disposed 

in the circumferential direction of the tire (91).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exercise stand for a bicycle, and 
more particularly to a bicycle exercise stand which holds the 
drive wheel of the bicycle clear of the floor surface and 
exerts a load on a drive wheel so that bicycle pedaling 
exercise simulates actual cycling. Using a bicycle as an indoor training apparatus has been done 
for several decades. There are on the market exercise stands 
which support a drive wheel, i.e. a rear wheel, of the bicycle 
clear of the floor and with which, by rotating the pedals, the 
user can achieve an exercise effect similar to that of actual 
cycling. One such stand is shown in Fig. 9. A pair of 
tubular members 101, 102 extend perpendicular to the drawing 
sheet and parallel with each other for forming a frame 100. 
Two pairs of legs 103, 104 (only the leg on the near side is 
shown) which extend upward are mounted at ends of the tubular 
members 101, 102. The upper portions of the legs 104 are 
pivotally supported at the upper portions of the legs 103. 
A pair of holding members 105 (only one is shown), for firmly 
holding the hub 111 of the rear wheel, are mounted at the top 
ends of the legs 103.  A loading device 106 is mounted on the tubular member 101, 
said device 106 generating a resistive force in accordance 
with the rotational speed of the rear wheel 111 . As shown 
in Fig. 14, the loading device 106 includes a resistance 
generator 107, having a rotating shaft 108, and a 
small-diameter drive cylinder 109 which is mounted on the 
rotating shaft 108 and makes contact with the tire 112 of the 
rear wheel 111. The resistance generator 107 includes a pair 
of permanent magnets and a metallic rotary disk secured to the 
rotary shaft. The magnets are disposed on the opposite side 
and face each other. The rotation of the rotary disk results 
in eddy currents and exerts a load on the rotating rotary 
shaft. When the rear wheel 111 of the bicycle 110 has been placed on 
the drive cylinder 109, by firmly holding the hub of the rear 
wheel 111 between the two holding members 105, preparation of 
the bicycle 110 for exercise is completed. A load resistance 
in accordance with to the rotational speed of the rear wheel 
111 is generated in the generator 107, and that load 
resistance is transmitted to the rear wheel 111 through the 
drive cylinder 109. When the tread pattern is of the rib type extending 
continuously in the circumferential direction, the drive 
cylinder 109 and the tread pattern are in contact with each 
other at every moment as the drive

An exercise stand for a bicycle (90) including a 
frame (1) for supporting the drive wheel (B) of the bicycle 

(90), and a loading device (2) having a rotary drive member 
(46) which rotates and contacts with a tread pattern provided 

with an outer peripheral surface of a tire (91) as the drive 
wheel(B) is rotated by the rotation of the pedals (92) of the 

bicycle (90), said loading device (2) being arranged to exert 
a resistive load to the drive wheel (B) characterized by 

that: 
   said rotary drive member (46) has an outer diameter 

enabling the rotary drive member (46) to contact with a 
plurality of adjacent tread patterns circumferentially 

juxtaposing in a tire (91), wherein said the tread pattern is 
block type. 
An exercise stand according to Claim 1, wherein the 
loading device includes a resistance generator (48) having a 

rotary shaft (49) operably connected to the rotary drive 
member (46) to a resistive load in accordance with the 

rotation of the rotary shaft (49). 
An exercise stand according to Claims 1 or 2, further 
including means (42, 53) for urging the rotary drive member 

(46) against the drive wheel(B) supported by the frame (1). 
An exercise stand according to Claim 3, wherein the 
urging means has: 

   a metal support member (42) pivotally mounted on the 
frame (1) and rotatably supporting the rotary drive member 

(46); and 
   a tension spring (53) disposed between the frame (1) and 

the support member (42), for urging the support member (42) 
toward the frame (1). 
An exercise stand according to Claim 4, wherein the 
resistance generator (48) is mounted on the support member 

(42) and the rotary drive member (46) and the rotary shaft 
(49) are operably connected by a belt (51). 
An exercise stand according to anyone of Claims 3 to 
5, further comprising: 

   holding means (54), for, against the urging force of the 
urging means (42, 53), holding the rotating drive member (46) 

in an non-pushing position in which it is clear of the drive 
wheel(B). 
An exercise stand according to Claim 6, wherein the 
holding means includes: 

   a stop pin (57) mounted on and projecting from the metal 
support member (42); and
