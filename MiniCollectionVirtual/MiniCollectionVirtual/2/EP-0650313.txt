<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for operating a fluorescent lamp 
having first and second power source circuits, the 

second power source circuit including a high 
frequency transformer having two or more outputs for 

supplying pre-heating electric currents to filaments, 
the second power source circuit being arranged to be 

controllable individually from the first power source 
circuit for supplying a tube electric current to turn 

on a fluorescent lamp so that the electric power 
level for pre-heating the filaments is switched 

between a state where a light adjustment is performed 
by turning on/off a tube electric current at high 

frequency and a state where the fluorescent lamp is 
turned off in a standby mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
operating a fluorescent lamp which is used as a light
source in a copying machine or facsimile apparatus and
which exposes an original document to light.Hitherto, a light source for exposing an original
document to light in a copying machine, such as an
electrophotographic apparatus, has mainly been a halogen
lamp or a fluorescent lamp. A fluorescent lamp is usually
employed in a low-speed machine that does not require a
large amount of light. Since the fluorescent lamp
consumes a very small amount of electric power, employment
of a fluorescent lamp in higher speed machines is
preferable. An examples of a drive circuit and of a control
circuit for a fluorescent lamp to be mounted on a copying
machine are shown in Fig. 16.Reference numeral 1 represents a fluorescent lamp, 2
represents an inductor for limiting an electric current
for turning on the fluorescent lamp 1, 3 represents an
inverter transformer, 4 represents an inverter transformer
drive transistor, 5 represents a resonance capacitor, 6
represents a DC stabilizing power source in the apparatus,
7 represents a diode bridge, 8 represents a control
transistor for turning the fluorescent lamp 1 on and off,
9 and 10 represent bypass capacitors, 11 and 12 represent
filaments in the fluorescent lamp 1, and 13 represents an
oscillator. Reference numeral 20 represents a commercial
AC power source, 21 represents an AC-to-DC converter for
generating a low-level DC output voltage VDD for use in the
apparatus from the commercial AC power source 20, 22
represents a system controller for controlling the system
of the apparatus, and 23 represents a mode signal for
controlling the output voltage VDD from the AC-to-DC
converter 21.The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 16 will
now be described with reference to a timing chart shown in
Fig. 17. When electric power is supplied to the
apparatus, the apparatus is brought into a standby mode. 
At this time, a standby mode signal is supplied from the
controller 22 to the AC-to-DC converter 21. This results
in an output voltage VDD from the AC-to-DC converter 21
that is lower than the voltage level required in the
copying operation, the lower voltage level being 12V in
this embodiment.The fluorescent lamp 1 is turned off during the
standby mode. However, a low level pre-heating electric
current must be supplied to the filaments 11 and 12 in
order to smoothly turn on the fluorescent lamp 1 when the
copying operation starts. In this case, the output
voltage from the
