<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermal detector having a monolithic structure, comprising a layer of material sensitive to infrared radiation and an insulating layer constituted by a heat-stable polymer which can be deposited as a thin film and having a microporous structure. This insulating layer enables the sensitive layer to be thermally decoupled from the substrate which includes read circuits, with which the detector is equipped. The performance of present-day monolithic infrared detectors may thus be significantly enhanced by virtue of the appreciable reduction in thermal losses within the sensitive layer and this is due to the greatly reduced thermal conductivity of the layer of dielectric polymer. Application: infrared images.

Process for producing a thermal detector which
includes a substrate and a layer (C
2
) of material sensitive
to infrared radiation, characterized in that it

includes the following steps:

production, on the substrate, of a first layer
(C
1
) of polymer dissolved in a solvent A;
segregation of the first layer (C
1
), causing
the appearance of a heterogeneous two-phase

layer;
removal of the solvent A, making it possible to
form an obtained layer (C'
1
) of polymer having
a microporous structure of reduced thermal

conductivity;
production of the layer (C
2
) of sensitive
material on the said obtained layer (C'
1
).
Process for producing a thermal detector according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the segregation

step is carried out by immersing the first layer (C
1
) on
the substrate in a substance B which is not a solvent for

the polymer and is miscible with the solvent A.
Process for producing a thermal detector according
to Claim 2, characterized in that the removal of the

solvent A is carried out, simultaneously with that of the
substance B, by heat treatment.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the heat treatment is carried out in an atmosphere

of a gas having thermal insulation properties that are
superior to those of air, so as to fill the micropores

being formed in the polymer layer with this gas. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the gas is xenon.
Process for producing a thermal detector according
to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the

polymer dissolved in the solvent A is a polyimide
precursor.
Process for producing a thermal detector according
to Claim 5, characterized in that the step of removing

the solvent A is followed by a high-temperature heat
treatment so as to convert the precursor into a polyimide.

followed by a step in which connection vias are produced

by etching.
Process for producing a thermal detector according
to Claim 11, characterized in that the production of

the connection vias is followed by a metallization step
