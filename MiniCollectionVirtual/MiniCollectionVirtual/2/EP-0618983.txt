<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to insertion elements, recombinant molecules and amplifiable
nucleic acids for use with nucleic acid hybridization assays; methods for identifying such
insertion elements, recombinant molecules and amplifiable nucleic acids, and methods for
making them. The utility of detecting target nucleic acids in clinical diagnostics is well established.
Various methods have been developed for detecting specific nucleic acid targets as diagnostic
of the presence of a particular organism. These include hybridization assays which rely upon
one or more nucleic acid probes designed to hybridize or bind to specific sequences within the
target nucleic acid.The sensitivity of the assay is a concern for all assay formats. Many formats include
specific means for enhancing the sensitivity of the basic assay. For example, methods have
been developed for amplifying the amount of target present in the sample to be assayed prior
to detection. This can be done using a variety of techniques such as the well known
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), multienzyme amplification
reaction (3SR), strand displacement amplification reaction (SDA), and target-dependent
replication (TDR).Assay sensitivity can also be enhanced by amplifying the signal detected. This can be
accomplished by monitoring a continuously generated signal over time or increasing the
number of labels for detection. This can be accomplished through the use of numerous probes
with single labels or the use of probes with numerous labels. Such signals can be readily
generated by radioisotopic, enzyme or fluorescent labels attached to an assay probe. These
techniques are well known. The assay signal can also be amplified by amplifying the probe
to which the label producing the detected signal attaches. This is illustrated for sandwich
hybridization assays as follows.Sandwich hybridization assays typically employ two separate nucleic acid probes. Each
probe is designed to hybridize or bind to a mutually exclusive segment within the target
nucleic acid. One probe, the detector probe, is constructed to combine with a label moiety.
The label moiety is either directly detectable or permits a detectable material to be made.
Suitable labels include radio isotopically labelled nucleotides, enzyme/substrate pairs and
fluorescent dyes as are well known in the art. The second probe, the capture probe, is
constructed to bind to a support in addition to the target. The capture probe is used to isolate
the target from extraneous and
