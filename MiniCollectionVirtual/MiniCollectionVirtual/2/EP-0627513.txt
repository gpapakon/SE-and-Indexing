<ABSTRACT>
In a fabric for the reinforcement or armouring of sheet-like structures (3), especially of plastic roofing and sealing webs, consisting of weft and warp threads (13, 14) forming open spaces (15) with one another, a basic fabric (11) has adjoining it an edge region (12) in which the weft threads (13) and/or the warp threads (14) are reinforced.

<CLAIMS>
Fabric for strengthening and/or reinforcing flat structures (3), more 
especially plastics material roofing and sealing webs, formed from weft and warp 

threads (13, 14), which form open spaces (15) with one another, characterised in 
that a basic fabric (11) is connected to an edge area (12), in which the weft threads 

(13) and/or the warp threads (14) are strengthened and the open spaces (15) in the 
edge area (12) are greater than in the basic fabric (11). 
Fabric according to claim 1, characterised in that two or more adjacent weft 
threads (13a, 13b) are brought 
together in the edge area (12). 
Fabric according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the warp threads in 
the edge area (12) comprise thread bundles (16). 
Fabric according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised in that the warp 
threads in the edge area (12) have a larger diameter. 
Fabric according to at least one of claims 1 - 4, characterised in that weft 
and warp threads (13, 14) are stabilised in the basic fabric (13) and/or in the edge 

area (12). 
Fabric according to claim 5, characterised in that the stabilisation is effected 
by means of plastics materials, starch or glue.  

 
Fabric according to claim 6, characterised in that the stabilisation of the 
fabric (10) is adapted to the respective material of the flat structure (3).
