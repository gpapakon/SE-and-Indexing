<ABSTRACT>
An operating lever device of the present invention includes 
a housing (3), an operating lever (5) pivotably mounted on 

the housing (3) by a first support shaft (4), a first link 
(7) pivotably mounted on the operating lever (5) by a second 

support shaft (6), an operating cable (8) connected to an 
end portion of the first link (7) and extending outwardly 

through the housing (3), and means (9) for restraining the 
pivotal movement of the first link (7) in a manner that when 

the operating lever (5) is operated the end portion of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bicycle brake operating lever device 
as defined in the preambles of claim 1 or 3.  
 From EP-A-0 593 842 as prior art according to Art. 54(3) and (4) 
EPC there is known a bicycle brake operating lever device of the 
kind referred to above. In GB-A-723 953 there is described a lever control means for a 
cable-operated mechanism, more especially for controlling 
variable speed gears for cycles. The movement of a lever is 
restrained at the positions of notches so that the lever device 
is fixed in the respective positions and the lever will not 
automatically return in the original position if the applying 
force will be released. Therefore this lever control means cannot 
be used as a brake operating device for bicycle.  
 A known operating lever device of this type is for example 
described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication Hei 3-292280. The conventional lever device is so constructed as to pull 
an operating cable connected to an operating lever when the 
operating lever is operated. A power transmission ratio adjusting 
mechanism is provided between the operating lever and the 
operating cable. Herein the "power transmission ratio" is defined 
as a value given by dividing an output produced on the side 
of the operating cable by a unit input applied to the operating 
lever. The conventional power transmission ratio adjusting mechanism 
includes an operating lever pivotally supported on a bracket 
by a support shaft, a slotted hole provided in the operating 
lever, a cam groove provided in the bracket, a cam follower 
engaging with the slotted hole and the cam groove, and a cable 
connector connected to the cam follower. It is so constructed that, when the operating lever is 
rotated about the support shaft, the cam follower moves between 
the slotted hole and the cam groove and thereby changing a distance 
between the cable connector and the support shaft, thus  
 
altering the power transmission ratio. In other words, with the conventional power transmission 
ratio adjusting mechanism, the cam follower provided at the cable 
connector is fitted in the slotted hole formed with the operating 
lever and in the cam groove formed with a housing, and therefore 
a frictional resistance excessively increases and the operating 
lever requires a greater power to be operated, thereby resulting 
in heavy lever operation. Since the operating lever is rotated with its support shaft 
being as a support point while the cable connector pulls the 
operating cable by
