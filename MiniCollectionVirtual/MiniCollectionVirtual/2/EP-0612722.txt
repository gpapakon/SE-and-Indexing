<ABSTRACT>
Isocyanate-substituted isophthaloyl chlorides may be 
made by forming a mixture of amino-substituted isophthalic 

acid or a salt thereof, with phosgene and halogenated 
solvent in the presence of a catalyst, heating said mixture 

in a pressure vessel under autogenous pressure, treating 
the mixture to remove the solvent, and distilling the 

mixture to yield the isocyanate-substituted isophthaloyl 
chloride. The preferred catalyst is imidazole and the 

preferred isocyanate-substituted isophthaloyl chloride is 
5-isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of isocyanatesubstituted 
isophthaloyl chlorides. According to this invention isophthaloyl chlorides are 
prepared by reacting an amino-substituted isophthalic acid 
or a salt of an amino-substituted isophthalic acid with 
phosgene and halogenated aliphatic solvent in the presence 
of a catalyst under elevated pressure and temperature, e.g. 
in a pressure vessel under autogenous pressure. The preferred amino-substituted isophthalic acid is 5-amino 
isophthalic acid and the preferred halogenated solvent 
is chlorinated benzene. Examples of isocyanate substituted isophthaloyl 
chlorides which may be made by the process of the invention 
are 2 -isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride, 
4-isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride and 
5-isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride. 5-isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride (ICIC) also may be 
produced by using alternatives to the preferred reactants 
mentioned above. For example, salts of 5-aminoisophthalic 
acid such as disodium 5-aminoisophthalate or 5-aminoisophthalic 
acid hydrochloride may be substituted for 
5-aminoisophthalic acid. Similarly, the catalyst imidazole 
may be replaced by other heteroatom-containing compounds 
capable of complexing phosgene. Examples of such catalysts 
include, but are not limited to pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide 
(DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and 
the like. Likewise, solvents such as dioxane or methylene 
chloride may be employed, so long as the solvent is 
reasonably unreactive with the reactants and products. The isocyanate-substituted isophthaloyl chlorides made 
by the process of this invention may be used in solution in 
a solvent to treat polyfunctional amino impregnated 
substrates, which treated substrates may be used as reverse 
osmosis membranes. The specification of copending EP 
91306964.7 describes a method of making reverse osmosis  
 
membranes wherein a polyfunctional amine treated substrate 
is treated with an isocyanate-substituted acyl halide. 5-isocyanatoisophthaloyl chloride (ICIC) was prepared 
by heating a mixture of 10 grams of 5-aminoisophthalic acid, 
a catalyst of 0.5 grams of imidazole, 60 grams of phosgene, 
and 50 ml of chlorobenzene solvent in a pressure vessel at 
160°C for 18 hours at under autogenous pressure. Removal of 
the solvent, followed by distillation of the product at 123-128°C 
and 0.2 mm Hg yielded 8.8 grams of ICIC.
