<ABSTRACT>
A circuit is provided for rectifying an AC input voltage to provide a 
substantially constant DC output voltage. A composite input voltage is derived from 

the AC input voltage, which is composed of a scaled input AC voltage shifted by 
a selected DC bias voltage such that the entire range of such input signal voltages 

is contained within the supply voltages of detection circuitry which controls the 
rectifier circuitry. The detection is thus carried out during both the upper and lower 

excursions of the input AC voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC supply circuit, particularly but not
exclusively for use in mains powered equipment which detects the magnitude of the
mains voltage applied and accordingly adjusts the operation of associated rectifier
circuitry.There exists, throughout the world, a wide variety of mains AC voltages.
Broadly, there are two groups: those of the low voltage range (88-132Vrms) and
those of the high voltage range (176-264Vrms). It is desirable to design electrically
powered equipment which can be used throughout the world, thereby to simplify
design and production and to allow equipment to be portable between countries
other than where originally purchased. This requires that the equipment must be
adaptable for use on both voltage ranges.The simplest way of achieving this has been to associate a manually
operated doubler/bridge switch with the equipment. The operator will set the
switch to the correct position before applying the mains voltage to the equipment.Figures 1A and 1B illustrate a manually operated doubler/bridge switch.
Four diodes D1-D4 are connected together as bridge rectifier. An AC input voltage
VLN is applied between nodes 2, 4, where node 2 is connected to the anode of D1
and the cathode of D2, and node 4 is connected to the anode of D3 and the cathode
of D4. Two capacitors C1, C2, preferably of equal value, are connected in series
between nodes 6, 8, being the DC output nodes of the bridge rectifier. A load L is
connected between nodes 6, 8 and is supplied with the DC output. A switch T is
connected between node 4 and node 10, being the node between the two capacitors.
When the manual switch T is open, as shown in figure 1A, diodes D1-D4 form a
conventional bridge rectifier with capacitors C1, C2 to smooth the DC output
generated. This is the bridge rectification mode. When the switch T is closed, as
shown by figure 1B, diodes D1, D2 and capacitors C1, C2 operate as a combined
voltage doubler and rectifier circuit of the known type. Diodes D3, D4 are
superfluous in this mode. This is the voltage doubling rectification mode.One major drawback of the manually operated doubler/bridge switch is 
that forgetting to check the position or choosing the wrong position of the switch
would cause damage to the equipment, otherwise the equipment will have to be
predesigned to prevent such damage, incurring extra cost.An automatic doubler/bridge switch circuit is also known, which
automatically doubles and rectifies a low range AC input voltage and which merely
rectifies a high
