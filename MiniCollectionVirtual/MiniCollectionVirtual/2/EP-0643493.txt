<ABSTRACT>
An improved error control coding scheme is implemented in low 
bit rate coders in order to improve their performance in the presence of 

transmission errors typical of the digital cellular channel. The error 
control coding scheme exploits the nonlinear block codes (NBCs) for 

purposes of tailoring those codes to a fading channel in order to provide 
superior error protection to the compressed half rate speech data. For a 

half rate speech codec assumed to have a frame size of 40 ms, the speech 
encoder puts out a fixed number of bits per 40 ms. These bits are 

divided into three distinct classes, referred to as Class 1, Class 2 and 
Class 3 bits. A subset of the Class 1 bits are further protected by a CRC 

for error detection purposes. The Class 1 bits and the CRC bits are 

encoded by a rate Â½ Nordstrom Robinson code with codeword length of 
16. The Class 2 bits are encoded by a punctured version of the 

Nordstrom Robinson code. It has an effective rate of 8/14 with a 
codeword length 14. The Class 3 bits are left unprotected. The coded 

Class 1 plus CRC bits, coded Class 2 bits, and the Class 3 bits are mixed 
in an interleaving array of size 16x17 and interleaved over two slots in a 

manner that optimally divides each codeword between the two slots. At 
the receiver the coded Class 1 plus CRC bits, coded Class 2 bits, and 

Class 3 bits are extracted after de-interleaving. Maximum likelihood 
techniques using soft decision are employed to decode the Class 1 plus 

CRC bits as well as the Class 2 bits. The CRC is also used to further 
reduce the bit error rate (BER) of the subset of Class 1 bits over which it 

was applied by using generalized decoding techniques. In addition to the 
CRC based bad frame indication flag, raw channel bit error rate 

estimates for each codeword are also sent to the decoder as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to digital communications 
systems and, more particularly, to a high performance error control 
coding scheme for channel encoders and decoders that adds redundancy 
to the data prior to transmission and then decodes the data upon reception 
in a selective fashion. Such devices for error protection of data are 
commonly referred to as "channel codecs" for channel coding and 
channel decoding. The invention has particular application in digital 
cellular networks but may be advantageously used in any product line 
that employs low rate voice codecs and require error control for 
compressed speech data. Cellular telecommunications systems are evolving from their 
current analog frequency modulated (FM) form towards digital systems. 
The Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) has adopted a 
standard that uses a full rate 8.0 Kbps Vector Sum Excited Linear 
Prediction (VSELP) speech coder, convolutional coding for error 
protection, differential quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation, 
and a time division, multiple access (TDMA) scheme employing a 40 ms  
 
frame subdivided into six time slots per carrier frequency. The full rate 
standard occupies two time slots per 40 ms and is thus expected to triple 
the traffic carrying capacity of the cellular systems. In order to further increase its capacity by a factor of two, the 
TIA has begun the process of evaluating and subsequently selecting a half 
rate speech and channel codec that would only require one time slot per 
40 ms. For the purposes of the TIA half rate codec selection, the half 
rate speech plus channel codec should have an overall bit rate of 6.5 
Kbps and is restricted to a frame size of 40 ms. The half rate speech 
plus channel codec is expected to have a voice quality comparable to the 
full rate standard over a wide variety of conditions. These conditions 
include various speakers, influence of handsets, background noise 
conditions, and channel conditions. The error protection scheme used in the full rate standard utilizes 
the well known half rate convolutional channel encoder. The half rate 
convolutional channel encoder adds redundancy to the compressed speech 
data by using a shift register, generating two output bits for every input 
bit, and multiplexing the output bits to form the output. The generation 
of each output bit is done by a weighted modulo 2 sum of the input bit 
and the shift register contents according to a predefined generator 
polynomial. The number of memory
