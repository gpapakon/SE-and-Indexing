<ABSTRACT>
The insert has a fixed casing (1) with an inner sleeve (2) arranged in the casing (1), a cage (3) which can rotate and move radially in relation to the casing (1), a spindle (4) fitted transversely in the inner sleeve (2) so as to pivot, engaging inside the cage (3) and actuatable from outside, and planely superimposed perforated discs. One of the discs is used as an inlet plate (5) and is secured to the casing (1), while the other is used as a temperature plate (6) and secured to the cage (3). A further disc is fitted between the inlet (5) and the temperature plate (6) and used as a volume plate (7) radially movable with the cage (3) in relation to the inlet plate (5). The temperature plate (6) can rotate with the cage (3) in relation to the volume plate (7) and move radially with the volume plate (7) in relation to the inlet plate (5).

corners in the bottom view and the shape of a trapezium 

in the top view, the base side of which runs 
perpendicular to the longitudinal centre axis. 
Holder according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterized 

in that in the region of the longer base side the volume 
disc (7) has teeth (72) on whose side the opening (71) is 

provided with an inclined wall (73) opening towards the 
temperature disc (6) and otherwise with a wall (74) 

perpendicular to the front faces of the discs. 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the temperature disc (6) is circular in form and 

has two sector-shaped openings (61) arranged in an 
axially symmetrical manner, one of which openings is 

connected to the cold water supply and the other to the 
hot water supply. 
Holder according to Claim 6, characterized in that on the 
edge between the sector-shaped openings (61) the 

temperature disc (6) has steps (62) let in on the upper 
side with which it rests on internal shoulders (31) in 

the cage (3). 
Holder according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
the steps (62) are separated from each other and from the 

openings (61), the walls (64) of which run perpendicular 
to the base surfaces. 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that in its contour the inlet disc (5) is formed from 

two diametrically opposite partial circles (51) of larger  
 

diameter and two partial circles of smaller diameter 
arranged between the partial circles (51) of larger 

diameter, which are connected together by straight line 
(53). 
Holder according to Claim 9, characterized in that the 
inlet disc (5) has two openings (54) arranged in an 

axially symmetrical manner with respect to its 
longitudinal centre axis, one of which is connected to 

the cold water supply, the other to the hot water supply, 
and which are circular on the underside of the inlet disc 

(5) and rectangular with rounded corners on the upper 
side, wherein the openings (54) on the upper side are
