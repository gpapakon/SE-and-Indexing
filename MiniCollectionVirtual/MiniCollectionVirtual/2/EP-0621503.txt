<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display element includes a 
transparent substrate (11)
, a plurality of source and gate 
buses (18,19) formed on the substrate (11), thin film 

transistors (16), each connected to a source and gate bus 
(18,19) and pixel electrodes (15), each connected to a drain 

electrode (15a) of the thin film transistor (16). 
One end portion of each pixel electrode (15) is 
extended under a gate insulating film (22) underlying the 

neighbouring gate bus (18) and defines an additional 
capacitance region (30). The extended portion of the pixel 

electrode (15) is divided into a plurality of comb-tooth-like 
electrodes (15b), each defining divided additional 

capacitors. One of the comb-tooth-like electrodes (15b1) is 
separated by a gap (40) from the pixel electrode (15), and 

first and second electrodes (41,42) for laser welding use are 
formed on the comb-tooth-like electrode (15b1) and the pixel 

electrode (15) facing each other across the gap (40). The 
first and second electrodes (41,42) form series-connected 

first and second capacitances (C1b,C1c) for laser welding use 
between them and a third electrode (43) for laser welding use 

formed above them with a gate insulating film (22) interposed 
therebetween. When one of the divided additional capacitors 

connected to the pixel electrode (15) is bad in insulation, 
the defective one of the divided additional capacitors is cut 

off and the first and second capacitances (C1b,C1c) are 
caused to short by welding, whereby the total additional 

capacitance can be held substantially constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal 
display element and, more particularly, to the configuration 
of an additional capacitance region which is connected to 
its pixel electrodes. Fig. 1 shows a conventional liquid crystal display 
element of a structure in which liquid crystal 14 is 
hermetically sealed in the space defined by a pair of 
opposed transparent substrates 11 and 12 as of glass with a 
spacer 13 interposed therebetween along their marginal 
edges. The one transparent substrate 11 has on its inside 
surface a plurality of pixel electrodes 15 each adjoined by 
a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as TFT) 16 
serving as a switching element. The TFT 16 has its drain 
connected to the pixel electrode 15 corresponding thereto. 
The other transparent substrate 12 has on its inside surface 
a transparent common electrode 17 opposite the pixel 
electrodes 15. As shown in Fig. 2, the pixel electrodes 15 
substantially square in shape are closely arranged in rows 
and columns on the transparent substrate 11 and gate and 
source buses 18 and 19 extend adjacent and along the pixel 
electrodes 15 in the row and column directions, 
respectively. At each intersection of the gate and source 
buses 18 and 19 the TFT 16 is disposed, which has its gate 
connected to the gate bus 18, its source connected to the 
source bus 18 and its drain connected to the pixel electrode 
15. A voltage is applied across a pair of selected 
ones of the gate and source buses 18 and 19, the TFT 16 
connected thereto at their intersection thus conducts to  
 
store charges in the pixel electrode 15 connected to the 
drain of the conducting TFT 16, and consequently, a voltage 
is applied across that portion of the liquid crystal 14 
lying between the charged pixel electrode 15 and the common 
electrode 17 to make the liquid crystal 14 permit or inhibit 
the passage therethrough of light, thus providing a 
selective display. The display can be erased by discharging 
the charges stored in the pixel electrode 15. Fig. 3 is an enlarged plan view showing one pixel 
and the neighboring portion in a conventional liquid crystal 
display element, Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken on the 
line IV-IV in Fig. 3, and Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken 
on the line V-V in Fig. 3. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the 
pixel electrode 15 and the source bus 19 of ITO or similar 
transparent conductive material are formed on the 
transparent substrate 11, a semiconductor layer 21 as of 
amorphous silicon is formed which bridges a gap
