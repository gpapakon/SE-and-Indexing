<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a mixed ionic electronic conductor membrane comprising a dense layer sandwiched between two porous layers. Furthermore the invention discloses the application of this membrane to the use of partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. One porous layer, which is in contact with air, promotes the generation of oxygen ions. The oxygen ions diffuse through the dense layer to the second porous layer which is in contact with a hydrocarbon and result in partial oxidation of the hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Multi-Laver Membrane Composites and Their Use in Hydrocarbon Partial OxidationFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to multilayer composites having a multicomponent metallic oxide membrane. In another embodiment, the present invention also relates to the use of the composite in a hydrocarbon partial oxidation process.Background of the InventionThe use of multicomponent metallic oxide membranes that are selectively permeable to oxygen has been proposed for a variety of applications. Among these applications are oxygen separation and utilization, including the separation of oxygen from air, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to produce chemicals in high temperature or electrocatalytic reactors, and complete oxidation of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in high temperature solid-oxide fuel cells.One type of multicomponent metallic oxide membrane is a non-porous mixed ionic conductor (MIEC) membrane. An MIEC membrane is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. This type of membrane is useful in a process for partially oxidizing methane. In this process the MIEC membrane is used as a component of a membrane reactor. The membrane forms a barrier between two regions. One region contains a gas having oxygen molecules. A second region contains both the methane reactant and CO and hydrogen produced during the partial oxidation reaction. The CO and hydrogen produced during this reaction are frequently referred to as syngas.The partial oxidation of methane reaction involves activating oxygen at the inlet interface of the MIEC membrane to produce O2'ions. The ions, each neutralized by two positive electron holes, diffuse across to the other side of the membrane where they react with the methane to produce CO and hydrogen. High oxygen selectivities, but low oxygen permeabilities, have been observed with a number of MIEC membranes operating in the temperature range used in the partial oxidation reaction. Low oxygen permeability leads to a low value of oxygen transport flux across the membrane; this in turn limits the amount of oxygen available to the partial oxidation 

reaction. Large surface area, high cost reactors are therefore needed for efficient partial oxidation to occur because of the low oxygen permeability.Efforts directed towards improving oxygen permeability have focused on reducing the thickness of the MIEC membrane. Experiments show, however, that reducing the thickness beyond a critical thickness on the order of a millimeter does not result in increasing oxygen flux across the membrane. MIEC
