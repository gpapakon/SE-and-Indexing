<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor ceramic device
using a ceramic element which has a negative temperature
coefficient of resistance.In a switching power source, for example, an
overcurrent flows at the moment a switch is turned on. As a
device for absorbing such an initial inrush current, a
so-called NTC thermistor device is used. An NTC thermistor
device has a high resistance at room temperature, and is
characterized in that the resistance decreases as the
temperature rises. This high resistance can suppress the level
of an initial inrush current, and, when the temperature of the
device is then raised by heat generated by the device itself,
the resistance decreases so that the power consumption is
reduced in a steady state. Conventionally, a spinel oxide is
used as a ceramic element of such an NTC thermistor.When such an NTC thermistor device is used to prevent
an inrush current from flowing, the NTC thermistor device must
have a low resistance in an elevated temperature state which is
caused by the heat generated by the device itself. However, a
conventional NTC device using a spinel oxide generally has a
tendency that the B-value is small as the specific resistance 
is made low. Consequently, such a conventional NTC device has
a problem in that the resistance cannot be decreased in an
elevated temperature state to a sufficiently low level, thereby
disabling the power consumption in a steady state to be
reduced.In Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. SHO
48-6352, etc., ceramics having a composition in which 20 mol%
of Li2O3 is added to BaTiO3 is proposed as an NTC thermistor
device having a large B-value. However, this NTC thermistor
device has a high specific resistance of 105 Ω·cm or higher at
140 °C, and hence there arises a problem in that the power
consumption in a steady state is increased.In contrast, a device using VO2 ceramics has
resistance-sudden change characteristics in which the specific
resistance is suddenly changed from 10 Ω·cm to 0.01 Ω·cm at 80
°C. Therefore, the device is excellent for use of preventing
an inrush current from flowing. However the VO2 ceramic device
has problems in that it is unstable, and that it must be
rapidly cooled after a reducing firing process resulting in
that its shape is restricted to a bead-like one. Since the
allowable current of the device is as low as several tens
milliamperes, there arises a problem in that the device cannot
be used in an apparatus such as a switching power source where
a large current flows. JP-A-48040395 concerns a
