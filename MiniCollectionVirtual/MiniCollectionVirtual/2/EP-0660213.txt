<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a plurality of commonly 
piped compressors for a refrigeration system having a 

plurality of refrigeration cases including the steps of 
sensing a suction pressure of the refrigeration system, 

determining whether the sensed suction pressure is within 
a predetermined pressure range, and turning compressors ON 

or OFF in stages until the suction pressure is within the 
predetermined pressure range. The method also includes the 

steps of sensing a case temperature for each of the 
refrigeration cases if the sensed suction pressure is 

within the predetermined pressure range and determining 
whether the sensed case temperature is within a 

predetermined temperature range. The method further 
includes the steps of turning selectively the load of the 

refrigeration cases ON and OFF until the case temperature 
is within the predetermined temperature range if the sensed 

case temperature is not within the predetermined 
temperature range and ending the method if the sensed case 

temperature is within the predetermined temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates 
to a method 
of refrigeration case synchronization for compressor 
optimization. A conventional refrigeration system such as that disclosed, for example in US-A-4 831 832, includes a 
compressor for compressing refrigerant vapor and 
discharging it into a condenser. The condenser liquifies 
the refrigerant which flows into a receiver. From the 
receiver, the liquid refrigerant flows through a heat 
exchanger and through a thermostatic expansion valve. The 
expansion valve expands the liquid refrigerant into a vapor 
which flows into and through an evaporator. Passing 
through the evaporator, the expanded refrigerant absorbs 
heat from a refrigeration case, aided by a circulating fan, 
and then returns to the compressor. Typically, the refrigeration system includes a 
plurality of refrigeration cases and compressors. The 
compressors are commonly piped together to form a 
compressor rack and pressure detection sensors are used for  
 
establishing and detecting a compressor suction pressure 
range in the refrigeration system for determining when 
upper (cut-in) and lower (cut-out) limits of the compressor 
suction pressure range have been exceeded. The 
refrigeration system uses a logic circuit for turning or 
cycling the compressors ON and OFF in succession or stages 
when the limits are exceeded to bring the compressor 
suction pressure within the compressor suction pressure 
range. One disadvantage of the above refrigeration 
system is that the cut-in and cut-out limits provide only 
a coarse control of the compressor rack in the compressor 
suction pressure range. As a result, the compressors of 
the compressor rack may be cycled frequently, resulting in 
a shorter life for the compressors. Another disadvantage 
is that the cycling of the compressors may cause the 
compressor suction pressure to rise or fall too quickly, 
resulting in excessive condenser cycling. Therefore, there 
is a need in the art to control each refrigeration case 
load to regulate the compressor rack only when the 
refrigeration cases cannot maintain control. There is also 
a need in the art to reduce the cycling of rotating 
machinery (e.g., compressors and condenser fans) by 
increasing the work done by non-rotating machinery (e.g., 
case expansion valves).  
 It is, therefore, one object of the present invention 
to provide a method of refrigeration case synchronization for 
compressor optimization. It is another object of the present invention to reduce 
cycling of rotating machinery such as
