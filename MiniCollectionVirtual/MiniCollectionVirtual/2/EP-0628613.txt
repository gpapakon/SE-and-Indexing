<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous coating
composition, especially to an aqueous metallic-base coating
composition suitable for automobiles.To minimize bad influences on environments, aqueous
paint has been intensely developed in the field of
automobile coating instead of conventional solvent-based
paint. But in general when a metallic-base paint containing
aluminum pigment for automobiles are made aqueous, the
aluminum pigment will not be oriented uniformly, which
causes poor appearance.To improve appearance finished by using an aqueous
metallic paint, for example, a coating composition
comprising a dispersion of particles which have carboxyl or
sulfonic acid groups are produced by two-step emulsion
polymerization, in Jap. Pat. Laid-Open Publication No. Sho
58-168664. But this coating composition, when coated on a
vertical or slanting face, is like to generate so-called
"sugging" which refers to a state of flow-down of the
coating film before drying, and "unevenness" which refers to
a convex part of the coating film caused by collection of
flown coating composition, and as a result the productivity
of the coating procedure may be reduced. 
Jap. Pat. Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 4-25582 discloses
an aqueous metallic-base coating composition containing
both an amide group-containing aqueous acrylic resin and an
urethane-containing aqueous dispersion, in order to improve
the appearance of the coated film, but there still exist
problems in coating workability. Jap. Pat. Publication No.
Hei 2-32947 discloses a process for preparing multiple
coating layers whose viscosity is controllable by using
fine particles of crosslinked polymer. However, the
fluidity is inappropriate for use as a coating liquid.US-A-5,166,254 discloses a water-based coating
composition comprising
A) 10-40 wt % of an acrylic hydrosol polymer having
an average molecular weight of 5,000 to 75,000 and
consisting of 2-10 wt % methylol methacrylamide, 2-10 wt %
hydroxyethyl acrylate, 1-6 wt % methacrylic acid and a
remainder amount of methyl methacrylate, styrene or
ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate; andB) 20-85 wt % of a latex polymer having a particle
size of 0.06-2.0 % µm and consisting essentially of
polymerized monomers of alkyl (meth)acrylate. Both
components A and B are reacted with ammonia or amine.The present invention provides an aqueous metallic-base
coating composition which enables a coating film to be
formed, having improved appearance at a high workability,
almost free from "sagging" and unevenness.The present invention
