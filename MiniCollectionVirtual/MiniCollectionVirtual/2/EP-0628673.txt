<ABSTRACT>
A shuttering block exhibits two longitudinal walls, forming an outer wall (1) and an inner wall (2), at least two transverse walls (3), extending only over part of the height of the block, a cavity (8), located between the walls and intended for filling with concrete, and an insulating insert (6) arranged on the inner side of at least one of the two longitudinal walls. In relation to the lateral end sides of the block, the transverse walls (3) are offset inwards, as a result of which, in the known manner, the shuttering block is formed at least approximately in the form of an H. In each case one further insulating insert (7) is pushed over the transverse walls (3), said insert enclosing the transverse walls (3) in each case laterally and in the region of their reduced height.

Formwork block comprising two longitudinal walls forming an outer wall (1) and 
an inner wall (2) connected together by means of at least two transverse walls (3) 

extending over only part of the height of the block, a hollow space between the 
walls for filling with concrete and an insulating layer (6) arranged on the inner 

surface of at least one of the two longitudinal walls, characterised in that the 
transverse walls (3) are set inwards in relation to the lateral ends of the block, the 

formwork block thereby forming at least approximately an H-shape in the known 
manner, and that a further insulating layer (7) is placed on each of the transverse 

walls (3), said insulating layers laterally embracing the transverse walls (3) in the 
region of their reduced height. 
Formwork block according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer wall (1) is 
provided with the insulating layer (6) and that the transverse walls (3) are at least 

approximately flush with the underside of the block on their undersides, the further 
insulating layers (7) being placed on the respective transverse walls (3) from 

above. 
Formwork block according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the 
insulating layers (6) for the longitudinal wall (1) and for the transverse walls (3) 

are made in one piece. 
Formwork block according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the width 
of the insulating layers (7) for the transverse walls (3) decreases towards the inner 

surface of the block directed towards the interior of the building on both sides of 
the transverse walls (3). 
Formwork block according to claim 4, characterised in that the insulating layers 
(7) for the transverse walls (3) taper towards the inner surface of the block 

directed towards the interior of the building when viewed from above. 
Formwork block according to claims 4 and 5, characterised in that the ratio of the 
reduction in the width of the insulating layers (7) for the transverse walls (3) in the  

 
region laterally embracing the latter from the outside to the inside is at least 

approximately 2:1. 
Formwork block according to claim 6, characterised in that, given a formwork 
block length of approximately 500 mm, the maximum width of each insulating 

layer (7) for a transverse wall (3) is approximately 20 to 40 mm for the region 
projecting laterally beyond each transverse wall (3). 
Formwork block according to claim 7, characterised in that, given a formwork 
block length of approximately 500 mm, the maximum width of each insulating 

layer (7) for a transverse wall (3) is at least approximately 30 mm for the region 
projecting laterally beyond each transverse wall (3). 
Formwork block according to claim 7 or claim 8, characterised in that, given a 
formwork block length of approximately 500 mm, the transverse walls (3) each 

have a thickness of approximately 50 mm and a spacing of approximately 200 mm 
and that, given a formwork block width of approximately 300 mm, the wall 

thicknesses of the longitudinal walls (1, 2) are approximately 45 to 55 mm and the 
insulating layer (6) extending along one longitudinal wall is approximately 50 to 

60mm. 
Formwork block according to one of claims 2 to 9, characterised in that the region 
of each insulating layer (7) covering the top of the transverse walls (3) is 

approximately 10 to 30 mm, preferably approximately 15 mm. 
Formwork block according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the 
transverse walls (3) each have transition regions (4) directed towards the top of 

the block in the connecting region with the longitudinal walls (1, 2).
