<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to benzodiazepine derivatives which are
useful as drugs exhibiting antagonism at the gastrin and/or CCK-B
receptor, and to their production.Many benzodiazepine derivatives have been described in the course
of development of psychotropic drugs which act as agonists at the
"benzodiazepine receptor" in the central nervous system. More
recently benzodiazepine derivatives have been described which act
as antagonists at the CCK-A (cholecystokinin-A) and CCK-B
receptors. It was further reported that those compounds which were
selective antagonists for the CCK-B receptor were able to reduce
the secretion of gastric acid in response to the administration of
pentagastrin (V.J. Lotti & R.S.L. Chang, Eur.J.Pharmacol. 162,
273-280, 1989). Examples of benzodiazepine derivatives which act
as antagonists at the CCK-B receptor are disclosed in, for example,
U.S.Patent No.4,820,834.The compounds of the present invention are novel. They differ from
the compounds described in U.S.Patent No.4,820,834, particularly in
the nature of the substituent at position 1 of the benzodiazepine
nucleus. The present invention includes compounds of better
pharmacological characteristics than those described in U.S.Patent
No.4,820,834; preferred compounds of the invention have a higher
affinity for the CCK-B receptor and/or discriminate more
selectively between the CCK-B and CCK-A receptors than the
previously described compounds.The present invention provides a benzodiazepine derivate of formula
I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof : "Halogen" may for example be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The aromatic residues herein (R2, R3) may be substituted.
Preferably at least one
of R2 and R3 is unsubstituted, monosubstituted or disubstituted
phenyl or unsubstituted, monosubstituted or disubstituted 2-, 3-,
or 4-pyridyl. Preferably one (most preferably each) of W and X is
a hydrogen atom.Preferably R4 is
cyclo- or polycycloalkyl (which may be unsubstituted or substituted
with one or more alkyl groups) and contains e.g. from 3 to 8 carbon
atoms; or is of formula II or III :
 
in which R6 is H, alkyl (e.g. C1 - C3) or -CO-alkyl (where the
alkyl is e.g. C1 - C3) and b is 1 or 2. Preferably R5 is
as defined for R4.Examples of cycloalkyl groups include
cyclopentyl and cyclohexanemethyl.Examples of saturated heterocyclic groups include pyrrolidyl and
tetrahydropyranyl. Examples of substituents at the heteroatom
include simple alkyl and acyl groups (e.g. of up to 3,4,5 or 6
carbon atoms, such as formyl,
