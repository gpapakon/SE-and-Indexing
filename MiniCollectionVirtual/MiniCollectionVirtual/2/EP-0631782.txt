<ABSTRACT>
To stabilize the active ingredients, a caffeine is 
incorporated into a solid pharmaceutical preparation 

comprising a dextromethorphan and a phenylpropanolamine. 
The pharmaceutical preparation may further comprise 

ibuprofen. The active ingredients may be further 
stabilized, in combination with the incorporation of 

the caffeine, by grouping and incorporating separately 
each or suitably combined plural of the active ingredients 

into different groups or by minimizing the amount 
of any reducing sugar such as lactose. The solid pharmaceutical 

preparation is practically valuable since 
decomposition of each active ingredient with the lapse 

of time is remarkably suppressed and the active ingredients 
are stabilized for a longer period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilized
solid pharmaceutical preparation which is useful for
therapy and prophylaxis of various symptoms of cold,
and a method of producing the same. In more detail,
the present invention relates to a stabilized solid
pharmaceutical preparation which comprises a dextromethorphan
as an antitussive and/or an expectorant, a
phenylpropanolamine as a decongestant effective for
nasal mucus and nasal congestion, and a caffeine, and
which may further comprise ibuprofen as an antipuretic,
analgesic and/or antiinflammatory agent, and method of
producing such preparations. Particularly, the present
invention provides a stabilized pharmaceutical preparation
comprising a dextromethorphan, ibuprofen and a
phenylpropanolamine which are stabilized by further
adding a caffeine to suppress or inhibit decomposition
of each of the active ingredients even when these
active ingredients are incorporated or granulated in
one group.Ibuprofen was first synthesized by Nicholson and 
Adamo in 1964, developed as a drug by Boots Pure Drug
Co., Ltd., England, and has been utilized mainly as an
antipyretic, analgesic and/or antiinflammatory agent.
A phenylpropanolamine is a sympathomimetic drug having
ephedrine-like pharmacological activities and therapeutic
activities for nasal mucus and nasal congestion,
and utilized as a drug for rhinitis in nonproprietary
drugs.In JP-A-61-501913 corresponding to WO85/04589, and
in WO91/17746, there are disclosed, for instance, pharmaceutical
compositions of cold remedies comprising a
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent such as ibuprofen
and the like as an analgesic ingredient, phenylpropanolamine
hydrochloride as a decongestive ingredient,
dextromethorphan hydrobromide as an antitussive and
chlorpheniramine maleate as an antihistamine. These
pharmaceutical preparations are prepared by mixing
dextromethorphan, ibuprofen and phenylpropanolamine
hydrochloride directly with lactose and/or other base
without being subjected to stabilization.As a result of various investigations for preparing
general cold remedies having more excellent actions,
the present inventors found that pharmaceutical
preparations comprising the dextromethorphan, the
phenylpropanolamine (e.g. phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride,
etc.) and further comprising ibuprofen are 
particularly favourable as cold remedies.These pharmaceutical preparations, however,
deteriorate or impair the stability of the active
ingredients, and, thus, cause not only decrease of the
effective amounts of the ingredients
