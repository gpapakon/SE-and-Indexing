<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bolt lock (2) for platform gates (drop sides, sideboards) of commercial vehicles, having a bolt lever (4) which is arranged in a hollow section (5), in particular in a stake, and can be swivelled by way of a locking hook (12) and a pivoting axis (14) about a swivelling axis (10). In the locking position the locking hook engages in a counterholder on a platform gate and can be swivelled into an opening position with the aid of an operating element engaging in the region of the pivoting axis. In order to ensure reliable locking and, at the same time, safe swinging down of a platform gate stressed with internal pressure, the hollow section and the pivoting axis of the locking hook are provided with latching elements (15,17) which are of complementary design, pass, in the event of internal pressure bearing against the platform gate, from a swivelling position into a latching position and block the opening movement of the bolt lever.

<CLAIMS>
A locking member for vehicle sides with a locking lever 
(4) located in a hollow profile (5), particularly in a 

stanchion, said locking lever (4) is pivotable with a 
locking hook (12) and an articulation axis (14) about 

a pivoting axis (10),
 
the locking hook (12) engages in a locking position in 

an abutment of a vehicle side and is pivotable into an 
opening position with the aid of a control element engaging 

in the area of the articulation axis (14),
characterized
 in that
 
the locking lever (4) is pivotable guided with clearance 

about the pivoting axis (10) and that
 
the hollow profile (5) and the articulation axis (14) 

are provided with complementary formed engagement elements 
(15, 17), which when an internal pressure acts on 

a vehicle side, pass from a pivoting position into an 
engagement position and block the opening movement of 

the locking lever (4). 
Locking member according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that,
 
as engagement element (15) of the articulation axis 

(14) is provided an articulation bolt (20) fixed on the 
locking lever (4) and which comprises a bolt shank  

 
(21) parallel to the pivoting axis (10), and that as 

engagement element (17) of the hollow profile (5) an 
engagement opening (22) is formed in the area of a base 

surface (6) of the hollow profile (5), in which the articulation 
bolt (20) engages with a free bolt end in 

the case of an internal pressure-loaded, inclined lokking 
lever (4). 
A locking member according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that
 
the engagement opening (22) is formed in a reception 

plate (24), and that
 
the reception plate (24) is fixed to the base surface 

(6) of the hollow profile (5). 
A locking member according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in that
 
the articulation bolt (20) is held under pressure in a 

pivoting position and in the case of a predetermined 
internal pressure exerted on the locking hook (12) engages 

in the engagement opening (22). 
A locking member according to claim 4,
characterized
 in that
 
a compression spring (23) is placed around the bolt 

shank (21) of the articulation bolt (20) and said compression 
spring (23) is supported on a locking lever-side 

guide ring (29) and on a guide ring (31) on the 
reception plate (24). 
A locking member according to claim 5,
characterized
 in that
 
a helical compression spring (25) with a defined compressive 

force is arranged around the bolt shank (21).  
 
A locking member according to claim 5,
characterized
 in that
 
a leaf spring (33) with a defined compressive force is 

arranged,
 
that said leaf spring (33) is bent in hairpin-like manner 

and has a locking lever-side spring leg (40) as 
well as a hollow profile-side spring leg (42), and 

that for guiding the bolt shank (21) in the hollow profile-side 
spring leg (42) is formed a circular opening 

(43) and in the locking lever-side spring leg (40) an 
elongated slot-like opening (41). 
A locking member according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the pivoting axis (10) of the locking lever (4) is 

arranged horizontally and is formed by a shaft (8) 
fixed in the hollow profile (5) about said shaft (8) the 

locking lever (4) is vertically pivotable and is held 
in an inclined position. 
A locking member according to claim 8,
characterized
 in that
 
the inclined position of the locking lever (4) is 

almost 5Â°. 
A locking member according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the shaft (8) is provided with a sealing element (36) 

in the vicinity of a hollow profile opening (37) for 
the locking hook (12).
