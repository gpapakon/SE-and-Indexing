<ABSTRACT>
A sheet or web material comprising a hydrophobic resin support or paper 
support coated with at least one hydrophobic resin layer wherein said resin 

support or resin layer is coated with a transparent antistatic layer containing 
as an essential component a polythiophene with conjugated polymer backbone in the 

presence of a polymeric polyanion compound, characterized in that said antistatic 
layer is coated with an overlying adhering barrier layer applied from an aqueous 

polymer dispersion wherein the dispersed polymer has hydrophilic functionality 
sufficient to render said overlying layer adherent to a thereon coated 

hydrophilic colloid-containing layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet or web material having 
antistatic properties, and is particularly but not exclusively concerned 
with recording materials wherein a hydrophobic resin support carries an 
antistatic layer and an overlying barrier layer imparting good adherence to 
a hydrophilic colloid-containing layer, e.g. a light-sensitive gelatin-silver 
halide emulsion layer. It is known that hydrophobic resin sheet and web materials of low 
conductivity readily become electrostatically charged by friction with 
dielectric materials and/or contact with electrostatically chargeable 
transport means, e.g. rollers. The charging occurs particularly easily in 
a relatively dry atmospheric environment. Sheets and webs of hydrophobic resins, e.g. polyesters or 
cellulosetriacetate, are commonly used as support element of recording 
materials. Such materials are subjected to frictional contact with other 
elements during their manufacture, e.g. during coating or cutting, and 
during use, e.g. during the recording of information, e.g. with a 
step-and-repeat or movie camera or - in the case of silver halide 
photographic materials - during image-processing or image projection. Especially in the reeling-up or unreeling of dry photographic film in 
a camera or projector high friction may occur, resulting in electrostatic 
charges that may attract dust or cause sparking. In unprocessed 
photographic silver halide emulsion materials sparking causes developable 
fog and degrades the image quality. In order to reduce electrostatic charging of photographic sheet or web 
materials comprising a hydrophobic resin support coated with at least one 
silver halide emulsion layer without impairing their transparency it is 
known to incorporate ionic compounds in these materials, e.g. in the 
gelatin-silver halide emulsion layer(s) or other hydrophilic colloid 
layers. In order to avoid diffusion of ionic compounds out of said layers 
during the wet processing treatments of said materials, preference has been 
given to incorporate therein antistatic high molecular weight polymeric 
compounds having ionic groups, e.g. carboxylic sodium salt groups, at 
frequent intervals in the polymer chain [ref. Photographic Emulsion 
Chemistry, by G.F. Duffin, - The Focal Press - London and New York (1966) -  
 
Focal Press Ltd., p. 168]. The conductivity of an antistatic layer containing said ionic 
conductive polymers is moisture dependent and is lowered considerably by 
treatment with an acidic photographic processing liquid,
