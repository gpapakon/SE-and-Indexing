<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling an occupant restraint 
system, such as an air bag (102), includes position sensors 

(80, 84, 86) for sensing position of an occupant and a 
weight sensor (70) for sensing weight of the occupant. 

Both the position sensors (80, 84, 86) and the weight 
sensor (70) are connected to a controller (24). A seat 

position sensor (30), a seat back incline sensor (36), and 
belt payout sensor (64) are also used to determine occupant 

weight and position. A vent valve (120) is connected to 
the reaction can (103) of the air bag (102) and is 

controlled by the controller (24). The controller (24) 
establishes an occupant weight range from the weight 

sensors and an occupant position range from the position 
sensors. The controller (24) selects one of a plurality of 

discrete control zones dependant upon both the sensed 
occupant position range and the sensed occupant weight 

range. The controller (24) then provides a regulating 
signal to the vent valve (120) based on the selected one of 

the discrete control zones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a vehicle
occupant restraint system and is particularly directed to a
method and apparatus for controlling an actuatable
restraining device.Occupant restraint systems for use in vehicles are
well known in the art. One such restraint system includes
a crash sensor, an inflatable air bag, and an actuation
circuit that controls deployment of the air bag in response
to an output from the crash sensor. The crash sensor can
be an accelerometer that provides an electrical signal
having a value functionally related to the vehicle's
deceleration. A controller evaluates the accelerometer
signal and provides an actuation signal when it determines
a vehicle crash condition is occurring of such nature that
the air bag should be deployed. The actuation circuit 
includes a squib operatively connected to a source of inflation
fluid.In response to an actuation signal from the controller, the
actuation circuit applies a current through the squib which
causes the squib to ignite. When the squib ignites, the source
of inflation fluid discharges gas into the air bag, which results
in inflation of the air bag.The art has recognized that it is not always desirable to
inflate the air bag with 100% of the gas provided from the source
of inflation fluid. One proposed system controls the amount of
gas that inflates the air bag in response to the detected weight
of the occupant. Such a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
5,232,243 to Blackburn et al. and assigned to the assignee of the
present invention. Another proposed system, disclosed in Gentry
et al., U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 986,041, filed
December 4, 1992, and assigned to the assignee of the present
invention, controls the amount of gas that inflates the air bag
in response to detected occupant position.European Patent Application No. EP-A-0 473 324 (Automotive
System Laboratory Inc.) proposes a system for controlling air bag
inflation dependant on the weight and position of a vehicle
occupant through sequential triggering of a series of ignition
cartridges to inflate the air bag, dependant on the sensed
position and the weight of the vehicle occupant. This European
Patent discloses an apparatus according to the preamble of claim
1.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method
and apparatus for controlling an occupant restraining device.According to the present invention, this object is achieved
by the apparatus and method for controlling an occupant restraint
system if of a vehicle as defined in independent
