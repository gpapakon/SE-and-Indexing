<ABSTRACT>
A bracket (4) for allowing mounting of an 
outboard motor on the tube (1) of an inflatable boat is 

secured to the tube by virtue of the inflation of the 
latter. Studs on the tube have heads (15) which when 

the tube is deflated can enter wide portions of keyhole 
slots (13) on the bracket but which when the tube is 

inflated are held by virtue of that inflation in 
narrower parts of those slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inflatable boats with 
outboard brackets. These are per se known objects 
which are used to enable the attachment of an outboard 
motor to an inflatable boat which does not have a rigid 
transom. Current outboard brackets are fabricated parts 
which are fitted, by means of projecting rods and 
hooks, into projecting eyelets on a pre-inflated tube 
of the boat. Both the fabrication of these brackets and 
their fitting to the tube present considerable 
disadvantages, for example in terms of cost, visual 
appeal and corrosion resistance. According to one aspect of the present 
invention an inflatable boat has an outboard bracket 
which is a one-piece integral member having a portion 
adapted to overlie the outer surface of an inflated 
flotation tube of an inflatable boat, a portion 
projecting therefrom and adapted to mount an outboard 
motor thereupon, and securing means in the conforming 
portion interacting with securing means on the tube, 
those means being engageable while the tube is in less  
 
than fully inflated condition, but being locked in 
inter-engagement in a fuller inflation of the tube. In a preferred embodiment the securing means on 
the conforming portion are keyhole slots arranged at 
opposite ends of the conforming portion and spaced 
apart around the arcuate circumference of the 
conforming portion, adapted to be engaged by studs 
projecting from the tube and entering through the wider 
portion of the keyhole slot for forming an engagement, 
and being urged into a narrower portion of the keyhole 
slot upon fuller inflation of the tube. In a preferred 
embodiment there are a pair of such apertures at each 
of the respective ends, the keyholes of one pair being 
arranged in orthogonal directions in relation to the 
keyholes of the other pair. Alternatively, the 
keyholes of both pairs may be arranged in parallel but 
opposed. Preferably, the conforming portion is held a 
small distance away from the tube by the securing 
means, to prevent chafing of the tube by the edges of 
the bracket. Distances of less than 5 mm are 
preferred, 3 mm being suitable. In further possibilities, at least one end of 
the conforming portion may be adapted to inter-engage 
with a receiving pocket on the tube whereby inflation 
of the tube assures penetration of the respective end  
 
of the receiving portion into the pocket and retention 
by that pocket. The invention provides in another aspect a 
method of fitting an outboard bracket to an inflatable 
boat which consists of

<CLAIMS>
An inflatable boat (3) with a bracket (4) for 
mounting an outboard motor to a flotation tube (1) of 

the inflatable boat (3), the bracket comprising 

a portion (6) for receiving said motor; 
a conforming portion (5) adapted to overlie 
said tube; 
securing means (13,16) on the conforming 
portion locked in interengagement with securing means 

(14,15) on an outer surface of the tube (1) when the 
tube is inflated but releasable when the tube is at 

least partially deflated. 
A boat according to claim 1 wherein said 
securing means on said conforming portion is a slot 

(13,16) and on said tube is a projection therefrom (14) 
and there is an overlap portion (15) on said 

projection, inflation causing overlap of said overlap 
portion over an edge of the slot to cause the locking 

interengagement. 
A boat according to claim 2 wherein said 
conforming portion has parallel upper and lower edges 

(11,12) and there is a pair of said slots adjacent each 
of said edges. 
A boat according to claim 2 or claim 3 wherein 
said slots (13,16) each have two portions, one being  

 
wider than the other and wherein said overlap portion 

(15) is a head of a stud (14) forming said projection, 
said head being wider than the less wide portion but 

narrower than the wider portion of the slot. 
A boat according to claim 4 wherein the 
elongations of said slots adjacent the respective edges 

are all parallel. 
A boat according to claim 4 wherein the 
elongations of said slots adjacent and said edge are 

perpendicular to the elongations of said slots adjacent 
the other said edge. 
A boat as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims with an outboard motor mounted to said receiving 

portion. 
A method of securing to an inflatable boat (3) 
a bracket (4) for mounting an outboard motor to said 

boat comprising providing securing means (13-16) on an 
outer surface of an inflatable buoyancy tube (1) of 

said boat and on a portion (5) of said bracket, in an 
at least partially deflated condition of said tube 

placing said securing means together, and inflating 
said tube to cause a locking interengagement of said 

securing means thereby and retain said bracket on said 
tube. 
A method according to claim 8 wherein the 
securing means on the tube are projections (14) with an  

 
overlap portion (15) thereon and the securing means on 

the bracket are slots (13,16) with two portions one 
being wider than the other, the narrower of the 

portions of the slot being narrower than the overlap 
portion (15) of the projection and the wider of the 

portions of the slot being wider than the overlap 
portion (15), the overlap portions being passed through 

the wider portions of the slots when the tube is at 
least partially deflated, inflating the tube causing 

the overlap portions to overlie the narrower portions 
of the slot.
