<DESCRIPTION>
 *HUNGER SUPPRESSING FOODSTUFF AND METHODThis invention relates to foodstuffs for suppressing hunger and particularly soft, drinks formulated to high total titratable acidity effective to suppress10 hunger when ingested prior to a meal- Soft drinks of all varieties are well known. They are prepared from still or carbonated water either at home or bottled for sale in the retail trade. The beverages are composed of water, sweetening agents, acid■"■-> flavor, color and optionally buffering agents and preservatives. Many contain clouding systems designed to replicate natural beverages particularly fruit beverages.The sweetener, acid and carbon dioxide ratios vary with the type of beverage flavor. FDA approved food~-^ colors are often used. Flavors are available from suppliers and can be alcohol extracts of ginger, grape and certain lemon-lime flavors. Emulsion of essential oils are available for citrus flavors, as well as root beer and cola. Caffeine is often added for bitterness. Fruit juice25 is widely used to manufacture orange, grapefruit, lemon, grape and lime beverages. Sodium citrate is sometimes employed as a buffering agent.Acidulents are widely used with citric acid, phosphoric acid, malic acid and tartaric acid most commonly30 used in carbonated beverages. These acids are usually employed at up to 0.12% by weight in ginger ale and lemon->35 

 lime and orange beverages and lower amounts in root beer and cola. Higher amounts are used in lemonade and grapefruit. See Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 4, pp 710-725 by John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y. (1978) .Numerous patents have disclosed sweetening compositions for beverages and beverages of reduced calories or of improved nutritional value. U.S. Patent No. 3,647,483, to Eisenstadt, teaches a saccharine sweetening composition comprising saccharine, with glucono-delta- lactone, sodium and/or potassium gluconate and cream of tartar used to avoid the bitter aftertaste of saccharine. The composition is not an acidic beverage and if employed in a beverage would not give the acid content required by the present invention.U.S. Patent No. 3,946,121, to Eisenstadt, discloses a sweetener consisting of saccharin, glucono- delta-lactone and an edible bicarbonate. Both Eisenstadt sweetener compositions are intended to sweeten coffee, tea and conventional beverages. U.S. Patent No. 3,619,205, to Le Van, et al. , discloses a slush iced beverage of still or carbonated water. Equal portions of the spoonable slush are mixed with water to form

<CLAIMS>
 What is claimed is:
1. A method of reducing food intake comprising: providing a foodstuff containing an intensive sweetener, an amount of acid sufficient to maintain a total titratable acidity in excess of 100, and buffer to maintain the pH above 2.5 said amount of acid effective to suppress hunger on later ingestion of food.
2. The method of Claim 1 wherein the foodstuff is a still or carbonated beverage having a pH from 2.5-6.0, and wherein the acid is selected from the group consisting of citric acid, glucono-delta-lactone, gluconic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid and mixtures thereof and the buffer is a salt of one or more of said acids.
3. The method of Claim 2 wherein the acid comprises citric acid, phosphoric acid and glucono-delta- lactone.
4. The method of Claim 3 in which each of the phosphoric and citric acids is present in at least 0.15% and the glucono-delta-lactone is present in at least 0.7% of the beverage.
5. The method of Claim 3 in which the buffer is present above about 0.25% of the beverage.
6. The method of Claim 5 in which the mixture of acids is present in from at least 0.7% of the beverage. 


 7. The method of Claim 6 which contains at least 0.2% citric acid, at least 0.2% phosphoric acid, at least 0.7% glucono-delta-lactone, at least 0.4% buffering material comprising salts of acids effective to maintain the pH from 2.5 to 3.5 and an intensive sweetener.
8. A food intake reducing soft drink comprising one or more edible acids in an amount of at least 0.7% of the soft drink effective to reduce food intake following ingestion of the beverage, at least .25% edible buffering material to maintain the final beverage pH above about 2.,5 and an intensive sweetener and flavoring.
9. The drink of Claim 8 in which the edible acid is selected from the group consisting of citric acid, phosphoric acid, glucono-delta-lactone, gluconic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid and mixtures thereof.
10. The drink of Claim 8 in which the acid is a mixture of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of citric and phosphoric acid and glucono-delta- lactone and wherein the acid and lactone total at least 0.7% of the beverage.
11. The drink of Claim 10 in which the buffering material is present in above about 0.25% of the .beverage.
12. The drink of Claim 10 in which the buffering material is present at above about 0.40% of the beverage.
