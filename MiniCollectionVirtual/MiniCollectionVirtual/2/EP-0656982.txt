<ABSTRACT>
An electrical rain sensor to be mounted on the outside of the main frame of an openable window, particularly a skylight, comprising a sensing element with two electrodes mounted opposite one another in an insulating holder, the distance between the electrodes being less than the size of a raindrop. To the electrodes an electric circuit is connected which by detection of a change in an electrical quantity caused by the presence of raindrops, activates a maneuvering device which closes the window. The holder (8) is produced by moulding of an electrically insulating thermoplastic, wherein the supply lines to the electrodes (15, 16) as well as a heating element for the drying of the sensor is produced as inserts in the holder by moulding of an electrically conductive thermoplastic polymer into excavated recesses and/or grooves in the holder (8). The electrodes can be designed as coatings of a weather resistant conducting material, particularly material containing graphite, the conducting material being applied to most of the surface of the sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
An electric rain sensor and a method of
manufacturing a sensor element thereto.The invention relates to an electric rain sensor
for mounting on the outside of the main frame or on
another stationary member of an openable window, in
particular a skylight, of the type where opening and
closing may be carried out by means of an electrical
maneuvering device, said rain sensor comprising a
sensing element with two electrodes opposite one another
in or on a substantially plane sensing surface of an
insulating holder, the distance between the electrodes
being less than the size of a raindrop, means for
applying a voltage between the electrodes and an
electrical circuit connected to the electrodes for
detecting a change in an electrical quantity caused by
the presence of raindrops, a heating element being
mounted on the holder for drying of the sensing surface,
and the holder being produced by moulding of an
electrically insulating thermoplastic.Such rain sensors are known for instance from DE-A-2363978,
DE-A-4023673, and DE-A-3939317 in addition to
CA-A-1119669 and are often installed in connection with
electrically operated windows in order to ensure the
closing of an open skylight in the event of rain or
snow. In known installations the sensing element is
frequently positioned inside on the main frame, in order
to avoid exposure to bad weather resulting in contamination
and corrosion to such a degree that the sensor no
longer functions as intended. Positioning the sensing
element on the inside, however, often results in a
particular drawback, namely that it frequently is placed
in such a manner - for instance on a vertical section
of the main frame - as to be sheltered from the wind
when the wind is in certain directions thereby being
struck by the rain either too late or not at all. DE-C-3 246 412 discloses a humidity sensing element
for industrial application
according to the preamble of claim 1,
wherein the electrodes are
imbedded in an added insulating layer.With some types of rain sensors a relatively long
period of time may pass before the sensing surface -
after having been exposed to rain - dries and
consequently the window can only be opened after a
significant time delay with respect to the end of the
rainfall.It has been attempted to avoid these problems by
the positioning of a rain sensor of the kind mentioned
above on the outside and attaching an electrical heating
element to the sensor, the heating element being either
permanently activated or turned on immediately after the
sensor has become
