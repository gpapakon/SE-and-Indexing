<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of adipic acid. The dominant commercial process for the manufacture of adipic acid 
involves the air-oxidation of cyclohexane to form a mixture of cyclohexanol and 
cyclohexanone, which is subsequently oxidized with nitric acid to form a mixture of 
carboxylic acids, including adipic acid. Another patented process (Burke U.S. Patent 4,788,333 and U.S. 
Patent 4,788,334) for making adipic acid involves the hydrocarboxylation of 
pentenoic acids and their esters. Pentenoic acids and their esters, and in particular 
3-pentenoic acid, are available from butadiene and butadiene derived feedstocks by 
metal catalyzed hydrocarboxylation. Such processes have the potential of providing 
high yield, high rate, low pollution processes for the manufacture of adipic acid. In the hydrocarboxylation of 3-pentenoic acid and its esters, 
undesirably high levels of branched products are formed. Burke (U.S. 4,788,333) 
has disclosed that, for the production of adipic acid by the hydrocarboxylation of 
pentenoic acids, high linear selectivity is obtained when an iodide promoted 
rhodium catalyst is employed in conjunction with selected halocarbon solvents. 
While better linear selectivity is obtained in halocarbon solvents, their use results in 
additional costs associated with the containment, recovery and recycle of these 
volatile, environmentally hazardous solvents. Burke discloses in U.S. 4,939,298, that branched diacids can be 
isomerized to adipic acid by heating in the presence of carbon monoxide and an 
iodide or bromide promoted rhodium catalyst. The most commonly used promoters for metal catalyzed 
hydrocarboxylation also promote the conversion of pentenoic acids and esters to 
valerolactones. These lactones normally consist primarily of gamma-valerolactone 
(hereinafter referred to as valerolactone). Valerolactone can be hydrocarboxylated 
to adipic acid as described in Burke EPO published application 0395038, but there 
are costs and yield losses associated with such processes.  
 In U.S. 4,788,334 Burke discloses that the rate of hydrocarboxylation 
of pentenoic esters in selected aromatic and halocarbon solvents is accelerated by 
the addition of an aliphatic or aromatic acid having a pKa in the range of 4.2 to 5.2. Craddock et al. (U.S. 3,816,489) have disclosed a process for the 
production of terminal carboxylic acids from ethylenically unsaturated compounds 
by hydrocarboxylation "in the presence of catalyst compositions essentially 
comprising
