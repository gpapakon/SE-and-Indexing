<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an olefin polymerization
catalyst having a multidentate ligand. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with
an olefin polymerization catalyst comprising at least
one transition metal compound selected from compounds
of formulae I and II:

wherein M is a transition metal selected from the group
consisting of metals of Groups IIIA including the
lanthanide series, IVA, VA, VIA, VIIA and VIII of the
Periodic Table of the Elements; X is an anionic ligand;
n is an integer represented by formula G-2 in which G
is the Group number of the Group of the Periodic Table
to which the transition metal belongs; J is a non-coordinating
anion; and 
ligand
L1 is a group containing at least one
phosphorus-containing group and ligand L2 which is
selected from a ligand having a σ-bond and a ligand
having a σ-bond and a bond selected from at least one
π-bond and at least one lone electron pair donative
bond;
wherein L1 contains an element of Group VB or
Group VIB of the Periodic Table of the Elements. The
catalyst of the present invention has extremely high
catalytic activity for an olefin polymerization reaction
as compared to conventional olefin polymerization
catalysts. Therefore, by the use of the catalyst of 
the present invention, a desired olefin polymer can be
produced efficiently with a high productivity per unit
weight of the catalyst. The olefin polymerization
catalyst of the present invention is also advantageous
in that it has high heat stability, that the olefin
polymer produced has high molecular weight, high bulk
density and improved powder characteristics, and that
the molecular weight of the olefin polymer can be
controlled and the amount of an auxiliary catalyst
which is optionally employed can be reduced.In the polymerization of an olefin, it is known to
employ as a catalyst a compound having a monodentate
ligand comprised of nitrogen as a heteroatom and having
a single alkadienyl ligand. For example, Journal
"Organometallics" 9, 867 (1990) discloses the polymerization
of an olefin in which use is made of a catalyst
comprised of a metal of Group IIIA of the Periodic
Table in which the catalyst has a heteroatom monodentate
ligand and, bridge-bonded thereto, an alkadienyl
ligand. Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Specification No. H3-163088 (corresponding to
European Patent Application Publication No. 416815)
discloses the polymerization of an olefin in which use
is made of a catalyst comprised of a transition metal 
in which the catalyst has a
