<ABSTRACT>
A seat device 2 includes a seat member 4 and, pivoted 
thereto, a seat back 6. A first end 8 of the device is 

positioned adjacent vertically extending side wall of a 
bus. The device is arranged to be moved between the 

operative configuration shown in Figure 1(a) and the 
storage configuration shown in Figure 1(d) by sliding the 

device horizontally in the direction of arrows 14 to the 
position shown in Figure 1(b); pivoting the seat back so 

that it lies flat against the seat member as shown in 
Figure 1(c); and folding a leg 12 of the device inwardly 

and pivoting the device about its first end 8, to the 
position shown in Figure 1(d). When so disposed, the 

space vacated by the device may accommodate a wheel chair.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seat device and 
particularly, although not exclusively, relates to a 
passenger seat device for a passenger vehicle, for example 
a bus or a mini-bus. The operators of passenger vehicles are obliged to 
provide facilities for wheelchair-bound passengers. At the 
present time, many passenger vehicles are modified by the 
complete removal of a two person seat, so as to provide a 
space large enough to accommodate a wheelchair. 
Disadvantageously, if the wheelchair space is unoccupied 
by a wheelchair-bound passenger, an able-bodied passenger 
cannot be seated in the space because the two person seat 
has been completely removed. Also, the seat cannot quickly 
be replaced in position after its complete removal. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a seat device which may alleviate the aforementioned 
disadvantages. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a seat device arranged to be fixed to a 
structure and being movable between a first operative 
configuration and a second storage configuration, the seat 
device including a seat member arranged to undergo 
translational movement during movement of said device 
between said first and second configurations. Such a seat device may advantageously be moved 
relatively quickly and easily between said first operative 
configuration, wherein the seat member of the seat device 
is suitably arranged to be sat upon by a person or 
persons, and said second storage configuration in which  
 
the device may be positioned, for example, adjacent a wall 
of a vehicle, thereby leaving a space in which a 
wheelchair may be positioned. Said seat device is preferably arranged to be fixed 
in a vehicle. Said seat member is preferably arranged to undergo 
translational movement between first and second positions. 
Said translational movement of said seat member between 
said first and second positions is preferably 
substantially linear. Said seat member suitably defines a 
substantially planar, suitably generally horizontally 
extending, surface upon which a person may sit. Said seat 
member is preferably arranged to undergo translational 
movement in a direction substantially parallel to said 
substantially planar surface of said seat member. Said 
seat member suitably includes front and rear portions 
which extend generally in a first direction. In use, a 
person suitably sits on the seat to face in a direction 
which is substantially perpendicular to said first 
direction. Preferably, at least a

<CLAIMS>
A seat device arranged to be fixed to a structure and 
being movable between a first operative configuration and 

a second storage configuration, the seat device including 
a seat member arranged to undergo translational movement 

during movement of said device between said first and 
second configurations. 
A seat device according to Claim 1, where said device 
is arranged to be fixed in a vehicle. 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein, in 
use, said seat member is arranged to be sat upon when the 

device is in said first operative configuration and, when 
the device is in said second storage configuration, a 

space, vacated by said device, is defined in which a 
wheelchair may be positioned. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said seat member includes a rear portion which extends 

generally in a first direction and at least a component of 
the translational movement of the seat member is in said 

first direction. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said seat member is arranged to undergo translational 

movement in order to adjust the distance of the seat 
member from a wall part of said structure. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said seat member is arranged to undergo pivotal movement 

during movement of the device between said first and 
second configurations. 
A device according to Claim 6, wherein a pivot axis 
of said seat member extends in a direction which is 

transverse to the direction of translational movement of 
said device. 
A device according to any preceding claim, including 
a seat back arranged to pivot between first a second 

positions. 
An assembly comprising a seat device according to any 
of Claims 1 to 8, said seat device being fixed to a 

structure. 
A method of moving a seat device according to any of 
Claims 1 to 9 between a first operative configuration and 

a second storage configuration, the method including the 
step of causing a seat member of the seat device to 

undergo translational movement.
