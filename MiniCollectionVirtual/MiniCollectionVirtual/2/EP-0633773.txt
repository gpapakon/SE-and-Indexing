<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a retinoid for the manufacture
of a medicament for treating hyperpigmentation in black skin and to a
cosmetic method for lightening black skin.The patent literature includes many references to the depigmentation of
skin. For example, DE-A-2131441 describes compositions for bleaching
pathologically hyperpigmented skin and normally dark, noncaucasian skin,
containing a bleaching agent (specifically hydroquinone and its derivatives), a
skin irritating and desquamation agent (including, inter alia, retinoic acid) and
an antiinflammatory agent.Similarly, FR-A-2383663 describes the use of ethanol/castor oil as a
vehicle for hydroquinone as a depigmentation agent, together with retinoic
acid and a corticoid, for treating skin spots resulting from sun exposure and
aging; and EP-A-0421110 describes a skin depigmentation composition
containing 4-hydroxyanisole and a retinoid, the latter serving to reduce local
irritation caused by the depigmenting effect of 4-hydroxyanisole.Additionally, US-A-4877805 is directed exclusively to the treatment of
sun-damaged skin with retinoids but mentions only the treatment of caucasian
skin. Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) presents as
irregular, darkly pigmented spots occurring after inflammatory
injury to the skin such as from acne, folliculitis, eczema and
shaving. PIH resolves slowly but may persist for months.
Black subjects of all ages are commonly afflicted with PIH,
and the consequent disfigurement may necessitate medical
attention (Kenney, Jr. J.A. et al, Clinics in Dermatology,
1989; 7:1-10; Grimes P.E. et al, Dermatologic Clinics, 1988;
6:271-81; and McDonald C.J. et al, Progress in Dermatology,
1979; 4:15-20). Unfortunately, although the biology of skin
pigmentation is well understood, therapy of PIH is
unsatisfactory, and currently available therapies such as
hydroquinones can be associated with unsightly depigmentation,
irritant dermatitis and ochronosis (McDonald C.J., Progress in
Dermatology, 1973; 4:15-20; Kligman A.M. et al, Arch.
Dermatol., 1975; 111:40-48; Findlay G.H. et al, Br. J.
Dermatol., 1975; 93:613-22; and Hoshaw R.A. et al, Arch.
Dermatol., 1985; 121:105-8).In recent studies of topical retinoic acid (RA) treatment
of photodamage, lightening of sun-induced dyspigmentation,
i.e., actinic lentigines, has been observed (Weiss J.S. et al,
JAMA, 1983, 259:527-32; Kligman A.M. et al, J. Am. Acad.Dermatol., 1986; 15:836-59; Weinstein G.D. et al, Arch.
Dermatol., 1991; 127:659-65; Rafal E.S. et al, New Engl.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a retinoid for the manufacture of a topical medicament for
treating post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation of noncaucasian skin, the

medicament not containing hydroquinone or 4-hydroxyanisole.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the retinoid is selected from
retinoic acid, retinol, 13-cis-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid.
Use according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the retinoid is
included in the medicament in an amount that allows topical application of

from 0.005 to 10 mg of the retinoid per cm
2
 of the skin to be treated.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
medicament includes also a cytochrome P
450
 enzyme inhibitor.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the skin is
Asian skin or black skin.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
medicament further comprises an ingredient selected from water, oils,

alcohols, emulsifying agents, perfumes, coloring agents, fillers, abrasive
agents and moisturizers.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the
medicament is in the form of an oil, ointment, cream, lotion or gel.
A method for the cosmetic treatment of noncaucasian skin to
effect lightening of the skin, the method comprising applying topically a 

composition containing a retinoid but not containing hydroquinone or 4-hydroxyanisole.

from retinoic acid, retinol, 13-cis-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid.
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, wherein the
composition is applied in an amount corresponding to 0.005 to 10 mg of the

retinoid per cm
2
 of the skin being treated.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 10, wherein the
composition includes also a cytochrome P
450
 enzyme inhibitor.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 11, wherein the skin
is Asian skin or black skin.
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 12, wherein the
composition further comprises an ingredient selected from water, oils,

alcohols, emulsifying agents, perfumes, coloring agents, fillers, abrasive
agents and moisturizers.
