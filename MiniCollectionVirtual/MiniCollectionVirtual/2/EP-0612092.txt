<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker with a tilting remote control unit (11) includes a first mechanism (20) associated with a handle (24) and with a switching bar (18) and a slider (110) for driving the handle (24) by means of a second mechanism (42) with a geared-down motor unit (74). Each mechanism (20, 42) is arranged between a pair of support plates (128, 130; 44, 46). The lower part of at least one plate (44, 46) of the second mechanism (42) includes a first anchoring element (132) intended to interact with a second anchoring element (134) provided on the upper part of the corresponding plate (128, 130) of the first mechanism (20) the engaging of the first and second anchoring elements (132, 134) at the end of tilting travel of the remote control unit (11), causing automatic centring of the second mechanism (42) on the first mechanism (20).

A remote-controlled circuit breaker (10) formed by assembly of a remote control
unit (11) on the front panel of a multipole circuit breaker (12) with an insulating case

(13), wherein :

the circuit breaker (12) comprises a first mechanism (20) associated to a handle
(24) passing through an opening of the front panel of the case (13), and to an

insulating switching bar (18) beanng the movable contacts (16) of the different poles,
the handle (24) being able to occupy at least two stable extreme positions according

to the open or closed state of the contacts,
the remote control unit (11) is mounted with rocking on a spindle (120) of a sole
(122) fitting on to the front panel of the circuit breaker, and houses a second

mechanism (42) equipped with a gearing-down device (74), and comprising :

first means (64, 58) for storing mechanical energy in at least one spring (50) of an
energy storage system (48),
second means for coupling the second mechanism (42) mechanically to the handle
(24) of the circuit breaker (12),
and third means (94, 106) for commanding opening and closing of the first and
second mechanisms (20, 42) resulting in rotation of the switching bar (16),
both of the first and second mechanisms (20, 42) being arranged between a pair of
support plates (128, 130; 44, 46).

characterized in that

the bottom part of at least one support plate (44, 46) of the second mechanism (42)
comprises a first securing element (132) designed to cooperate with a second

securing element (134) provided on the top part of the corresponding support plate
(128, 130) of the first mechanism (20), coming into engagement of the first and

second securing elements (132, 134) at the end of the rocking travel of the remote
control unit (11) causing automatic centring of the second mechanism (42) on the first 

mechanism (20), and that
the second mechanism (42) is provided with a slide rack (110) driving the handle
(24), and with an error prevention device cooperating with the handle (24) to prevent

the end of rocking travel of the remote control unit (11) in case of discrepancy of the
states of the first and second mechanisms (20, 42).
The remote-controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the
distance separating the two parallel plates (44, 46) of the second mechanism (42) is

identical to that separating the support plates (128,130) of the first mechanism (20).
The remote-controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the first securing element (132) is formed by a female part cooperating with a

conjugate male part of the second securing element (134), said male part comprising
a tooth protruding out from the front panel of the circuit breaker.
The remote-controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the
upper face of the fitting sole (122) bears a connection terminal block (127) and is

provided with at least one lateral opening (126) for access to the compartments
housing the auxiliary units provided in the case (13) of the circuit breaker.
The remote-controlled circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the

error prevention device comprises a protuberance (136) of the slide rack (110) and
an indicator (138) for indicating the loaded or non-loaded state of the energy storage

system (48), and that said indicator (138) comprises an error prevention lever (140)
having a first end securedly affixed to a drive lever (58) arranged between the slide

rack (110) and the energy storage system (48), and a second end in the shape of a
blocking nose (146) designed to interfere with the handle (24) when the circuit

breaker is open and the second mechanism (42) is in the non-loaded state.
The remote-controlled circuit breaker according to claim 5, characterized in that the
protuberance (136) of the slide rack (110) is arranged to come up against the stop

formed by the handle (24) when the circuit breaker is closed and the second
mechanism (42) is in the closed state.
