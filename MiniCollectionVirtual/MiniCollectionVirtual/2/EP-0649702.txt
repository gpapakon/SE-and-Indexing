<ABSTRACT>
The surface of a fatigue-resistant eutectic or near-eutectic 
lead/tin solder containing at least one doping 

element of cadmium, indium, and antimony is treated with an 
aqueous solution of an acidic chloride or acidic nitrate. 

The surface treatment method of the present invention removes, 
or substantially reduces, the presence of any cadmium, 

indium, and/or antimony, as well as the oxides of tin 
and lead, leaving a surface that is substantially tin and 

lead. The resulting treatment renders the solder compatible 
with mildly reducing fluxes of low activity and improves 

the wettability of the solder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tin-lead eutectic 
solders, and, more particularly, to improving the fatigue 
resistance of such solders. Eutectic and near-eutectic lead-tin solder alloys are 
used to provide solder joints in a wide variety of electronic 
devices. In addition to providing electrical connections, 
the solder joint provides a vital mechanical link 
between electronic devices and connectors. During operation, many electrical devices are subjected 
to vibration and continual changes in temperature. Many 
times, the coefficient of thermal expansion of each the 
various materials at and around the solder joint is different. 
As a result, the continual changes in temperature 
cause the solder joint to be continually subjected to varying 
degrees of stress and strain. The solder joint may 
also undergo continual stress due to vibrations and other 
forces exerted against the joint. It would be desirable to provide solder joints which 
are structurally strong and resist fatigue due to mechanical 
or thermal stress and strain. Such fatigue-resistant 
solder would be especially well-suited for used in electronic 
equipment which is subjected to extreme thermal 
fluctuations and mechanical load. Further, fatigue-resistant 
solder would be desirable for use in electronic devices 
where a long service life is required.  
 Fatigue-resistant solders are disclosed and claimed in 
application Serial No. 08/015,875, filed February 10, 1993, 
entitled "Improved Fatigue-Resistant Eutectic Solder", and 
assigned to the same assignee as the present application. 
The fatigue-resistant solders are lead-tin eutectic solders 
free of silver and gold and doped with less than 1 weight 
percent of at least one dopant selected from the group consisting 
of cadmium, indium, and antimony. The doped solder 
has improved fatigue resistance over undoped solders. Continued investigations with these fatigue-resistant 
solders show that some desirable flux materials cannot be 
used to improve wetting and diminish the tendency of the 
solder to form balls. The reason for this is that the surfaces 
of the solder particles are enriched in the oxides of 
the Cd, In, and Sb dopants, and these oxides inhibit wetting 
of the metallic surfaces to be soldered. They also 
inhibit the fusing of solder particles into a single, massive 
solder joint. Specifically, experiments by the present inventors on 
Cd- and In-containing solders show that these dopants tend 
to segregate at the surface of the solder and tend to oxidize.
