<ABSTRACT>
An infusion maker comprising, similarly to an espresso 
maker, a lower container or boiler (11) and an upper 

container (12). The bottom (12') of the upper container 
(12) is provided with an outlet (16) which connects 

said upper container (12) with the intermediate cup 
(14), and the chimney conduit (15) conveying the liquid 

from the lower container to the upper container is 
provided with a movable sleeve (17) which may be moved 

from a position associated with the closing of said 
outlet (16) and the opening of said chimney conduit 

(15), thus permitting the passage of the liquid from 
the lower container into the upper container, to a 

position associated with the opening of said outlet 
(16) and the closing of said chimney conduit, thus 

causing the liquid in the upper container to pour into 
the lower container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infusion maker 
for preparing infusions and similar potions. At present, infusion makers are known which have 
their own specific structure and only one modality of 
use. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an infusion maker that may be used advantageously as a 
real infusion maker and as an espresso maker as well, 
being it suitable for two modalities of use. Another object of this invention is to provide an 
infusion maker having the same general configuration as 
an espresso maker, of the type comprising two 
containers superimposed and communicating through a  
 
filter, but suitable for permitting the passage of 
liquid from the lower container to the upper container 
and vice-versa, so that liquid may also flow several 
times through the product from which an infusion is 
obtained. The infusion maker according to the present 
invention is substantially as claimed in claim 1; 
however, further details will become apparent from the 
continuation of the description, illustrated only by 
way of non-limitative example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows the infusion maker viewed from outside; Figure 2 is a vertical sectional view of the machine, 
with water flowing upwards from the lower container to 
the upper container. Figure 3 is a sectional view similar to Figure 2, but 
with water flowing downwards, from the upper container 
to the lower container of the machine. Figure 4 shows an enlarged detail of Figure 2, and Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view at the level of the 
cover. Such infusion maker - like any machine for the 
production of espresso coffee - comprises a lower 
container or boiler 11 designed to receive starting 
water, an upper container 12, with a handle, designed  
 
to receive infusion and provided with a cover 13, and a 
cup 14 located between the lower and the upper 
containers, designed to contain the herbs or product 
used to get an infusion. Said cup 14 is designed to be 
introduced into the upper part of the lower container 
or boiler 11 and is provided with a suction conduit 14' 
which extends downwards and ends in proximity to the 
bottom of said lower container or boiler 11. The upper container 12 is blocked, for example by 
screwing and in a watertight manner, on the lower 
container or boiler 11, and the bottom thereof 12' is 
above the intermediate cup 14 and the product contained 
therein. In the middle of the upper container 12, a 
chimney conduit 15 is provided which projects

<CLAIMS>
1) An infusion maker comprising, similarly to an 
espresso maker, a lower container or boiler (11) 

designed to 
receive starting water, an upper container (12) 

provided with a cover (13) and designed to receive 
infusion, a cup (14) located between the upper and 

lower containers and designed to contain the product 
from which the infusion is produced, both containers 

being blocked one on the other in a watertight manner, 
the cup (14) being provided with a suction conduit 

(14') which extends downwards and ends in proximity to 
the bottom of the lower container (11), and the upper 

container being provided with a bottom (12') from which 
a chimney conduit (15) projects, the said chimney 

conduit being open at the bottom, towards the 
intermediate cup (14), and closed at the top, and 

having at least one radial hole (15') for permitting 
the liquid in the lower container to run upwards into 

the upper container after flowing through the product 
in the said cup (14) when the infusion maker is heated, 

characterized in that at least one outlet (16) is 
provided in the bottom (12') of the upper container 

(12) which connects the said container (12) with the 
intermediate cup (14) and in that the chimney conduit 

 
(15) is provided with a movable sleeve (17) which may 

be moved from a position associated with the closing of 
said outlet (16) and the opening of said radial hole 

(15') of the chimney conduit (15), thus permitting the 
passage of the liquid from the lower container into the 

upper container, to a position associated with the 
opening of said outlet (16) and the closing of said 

radial hole (15'), thus causing the liquid in the upper 
container to pour into the lower container after 

flowing through the intermediate cup. 
2. An infusion maker as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
said sleeve (17) caps and is movable on the chimney 

conduit (15), and it is fixed to a knob (19) located on 
the cover for the displacements of the sleeve. 
3. An infusion maker as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
wherein the said sleeve (17) is provided, at the 

bottom, with a closing shaft (18') designed to be 
introduced into the outlet 16 like a plug, and, at the 

top, with a radial hole (20) which may be moved to a 

position coinciding with or away from the radial hole 
(15'), the said movements being associated with 

displacements of the sleeve. 
4. An infusion maker as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
said outlet (16) and/or the said closing shaft (18') 

are provided with a seal (16'). 
5. An infusion maker as claimed in claims 3 and 4, 
wherein the said sleeve is susceptible of upward and 

rotatory displacements. 
6. An infusion maker which can also be used as a coffee 
maker and for the production of espresso coffee 

when the sleeve is in a position associated with the 
closing of the outlet (16) and the opening of the 

radial hole (15') in the chimney conduit (15).
