<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an injection moulding maching or die casting machine which a sensor arrangement is provided within the die to allow detection of the melt front by means of an associated method. A sensor arrangement (21) of this kind comprises a measuring passage (16) which extends transversely to the direction of transport of the melt, within the gate of the die (8, 9), the said passage being closed by the melt front and triggering a corresponding switching signal.

Diecasting or injection moulding machine with a device
for detecting the melt front of the cast material, with one

stationary and one moving mould half with a runner optionally
contained therein and mould cavity, wherein the melt can be

injected by an injection piston via the runner into the mould
cavity of the mould and the position of the melt front can be

detected by means of a sensor, characterised in that the
measured height (29) of the melt front (15) is arranged in

front of the mould cavity (6) and in that the sensor comprises
a measuring duct or measuring gap (16, 16') which extends

transversely to the conveying direction of the melt and of
which the passage can be closed by the rising melt front (15)

so the sensor arranged outside the measuring duct or measuring
gap (16, 16') generates a measurement signal for the open

and/or closed loop control of the machine parameters.
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that a
thin measuring duct (16) is provided which is designed as a

horizontal transverse groove and is allocated a vacuum system
(20) for evacuation purposes and in that a pressure signal

(32) can be generated as control signal (33) by means of a
pressure measuring device (21) on the basis of the penetration

of a proportion of the melt front (15) into the measuring duct
(16).
Machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the measuring duct (16, 16') is introduced into the moving or

stationary mould half (9) of the diecasting mould (7).
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the

measuring duct (16, 16') is arranged in the region of the
runner (13). 
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a measuring chamber (30) for the

collection of melt is provided between the runner (13) and the
measuring duct (16, 16').
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a cooling arrangement (22) and

preferably a cooling duct (22) and preferably a temperature
measuring device (24, 25) are provided in the region of the

horizontally extending transverse groove or of the measuring
duct (16, 16').
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the
sensor comprises, as measuring gap or measuring duct, a

horizontal thin transverse groove (16') which is equipped with
a signal generator (38) on one side and a signal receiver (40)

on the other side of the diecasting mould (7) and in that a
passage signal (39) can be generated by the diecasting mould

(7) and can be interrupted in the sense of signal generation
when the melt front (15) reaches the measured height (29).
Machine according to claim 7, characterised in that an
ultrasonic device or a light beam with photodiode and light

barrier or a laser beam device with a respective transmitter
and receiver is used as signal transmission means.
Method of detecting the melt front of the cast material
on a diecasting or injection moulding machine with a

stationary and a moving mould half with runner and mould
cavity contained therein, wherein the melt is injected via the

runner into the mould cavity of the casting mould by means of
an injection piston and the position of the melt front is

detected by a sensor, characterised in that the measured
height (29) of the melt front (15) is arranged, in particular

in the region of the runner (13), in front of the mould cavity
(6) and in that a thin measuring duct or measuring gap (16,

16') is provided which extends transversely to the conveyance 
direction of the melt, of which the passage is closed by the

rising melt front (15) and thus generates a measurement signal
for the open and/or closed loop control of the machine

parameters.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that a
proportion of the melt front (15) penetrates into the

measuring duct (16) designed as a thin horizontal transverse
groove, solidifies there and in that a pressure signal (32) is

generated as control signal (33) by vacuum by means of a
vacuum system (20).
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that the
melt front is cooled by means of a cooling arrangement (22) in

the region of the horizontally extending transverse groove or
the measuring duct (16, 16'), a temperature measuring device

(24, 25) preferably being provided to detect the temperature
of the melt.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that the
sensor device comprises as measuring gap a horizontal thin

transverse groove (16, 16') which is equipped with a signal
generator (38) on one side and a signal receiver (40) on the

other side of the diecasting mould (7) and in that a passage
signal (39) is provided by the diecasting mould (7) and is

interrupted in the sense of signal generation when the melt
front (15) reaches the measured height (29).
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that an
ultrasonic device or a light beam with photodiode and light

barrier or a laser beam device with a respective transmitter
and receiver is used as signal transmission means.
