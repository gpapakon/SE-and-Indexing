<ABSTRACT>
A panty liner (10) comprising a primary liquid-retaining 
component in the form of a unitary sheet of non-woven 

fabric (12). A liquid-impervious barrier layer (20) is affixed to 
the sheet of non-woven fabric (12) to prevent body exudate 

absorbed therein to egress through a garment facing side 
of the panty liner (10). The invention also extends to a 

method and to an apparatus for manufacturing the panty 
liner (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a disposable panty liner as disclosed
in the preamble of claim 1 and to a method and to an apparatus
for manufacturing the aforementioned panty liner. The preamble
of claim 1 is based on EP-A-0 104 906.EP-A-0 104 906 describes a panty liner having an absorbent
body facing side made of non-woven fabrics, such as rayon, and
a garment facing side, wherein the body facing side may also
include an outer cover. The outermost surface of the body
facing side of the liner is provided with an aesthetically
pleasing pattern of depressed areas, which are in the form of
flowers.To prevent garment staining as a result of occasional non-menstrual
vaginal discharges, it is common practice to use a
thin, disposable absorbent product known in the trade as
"panty liner" which is fastened to the undergarment of the
wearer to capture and retain the body exudate. Typically, a
panty liner is constructed in the same fashion as a sanitary
napkin. More specifically, it has a thin absorbent core
confined into an envelope including a top, liquid-permeable
layer and a bottom, liquid-impervious layer. To fasten the
panty liner to the undergarment of the wearer, the liquid-impervious
bottom layer is coated on selected areas with
pressure-sensitive 
adhesive which is covered with a silicone-coated, peelable
paper sheet protecting the adhesive while the panty liner
is not in use. This form of construction yields an
absorbent product which is efficient in providing the
required protection against leakage and garment staining.Panty liners are intended to be used much more
frequently than sanitary napkins, sometimes on a daily
basis, and for that reason, it is desirable to manufacture
the product at the lowest possible cost. However, most of
the currently marketed products require sophisticated and
complex assembly equipment and techniques which makes the
objective of a very low cost product difficult to achieve.An object of the present invention is a panty liner
which is relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture,
yet capable to provide excellent protection against
garment staining from non-menstrual vaginal discharges.Another object of the invention is a method for
manufacturing the aforementioned panty liner.Another object of the invention is an apparatus for
manufacturing the aforementioned panty liner. As embodied and broadly described herein, the
invention provides a disposable panty liner (for the
purpose of this specification, the expression "panty
liner" shall mean a sanitary product for absorbing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disposable panty liner, comprising:

a unitary sheet of non-woven fabric constituting a
primary liquid-retaining component of said panty liner, said unitary sheet of non-woven fabric includes a top surface

constituting a skin-contacting surface of said panty
liner;

and
a liquid-impervious barrier layer on said unitary
sheet of non-woven fabric for preventing body exudate

collected by said unitary sheet of non-woven fabric to
egress through a garment facing side of said panty liner,

characterized in that

said top
surface comprises a plurality of recesses in a spaced

apart relationship, said recesses being capable to retain
highly viscous body exudate discharged on said panty

liner.
A panty liner as defined in claim 1, wherein said
unitary sheet of non-woven fabric comprises rayon fibers.
A panty liner as defined in claim 2, wherein said
unitary sheet of non-woven fabric comprises rayon fibers

blended with an additive provided in an amount ranging
from about 20% to about 40% by weight of the unitary sheet 

of non-woven fabric and selected from the group consisting
of polypropylene fibers, cotton fibers, acrylic fibers,

wood pulp fibers, bico fibers, paper fragments and
mixtures thereof.
A panty liner as defined in claim 1, wherein said
unitary sheet of non-woven fabric includes a binder

substance for increasing a resistance of said unitary
sheet of non-woven fabric.
A panty liner as defined in claim 4, wherein said
binder substance is selected from the group consisting of

vinyl ethylene, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, vinyl
acrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate,

carboxylated polystyrene, rubber polyethylene,
polyacrylonitrile and mixtures thereof.
A panty liner as defined in claim 4, wherein said
binder substance is present in said unitary sheet of non-woven

fabric in the range from about 8% to about 17% of
solids by weight of said unitary sheet of non-woven fabric

treated with binder. 
A method for manufacturing a panty liner as defined in
any of the claims 1 to 6, said method comprising the

steps of:

providing a unitary sheet of non-woven fabric having
a top surface constituting a skin-contacting surface of

said panty liner;
forming said non-woven fabric with a plurality of
recesses in a spaced apart re
lationship, said recesses
being capable to retain highly viscous body exudate

discharged on said panty liner;
cutting said non-woven fabric to form a primary
liquid-retaining component; 
providing said primary liquid-retaining component
with a liquid-impervious barrier layer to prevent body

exudate captured by said primary liquid-retaining component
to egress from a garment facing side of said panty

liner.
An apparatus for manufacturing panty liners as defined in
any of the claims 1 to 6 from fibrous starting material

in sheet form whose individual fibers are capable of
movement under the influence of applied fluid forces,

said apparatus comprising:

means to generate a fluid stream applied to said
starting material for entangling said fibers to form a

unitary non-woven fabric having a top surface constituting
a skin-contacting surface of said panty liner;
means to form a plurality of recesses in a spaced
apart relationship, said recesses being capable to retain

highly viscous body exudate discharged on said panty
liner;
means for applying on a first main surface of said
non-woven fabric a binder to increase a resistance of

said non-woven fabric;
means for providing on said non-woven fabric a
liquid-impervious barrier layer to prevent body exudate

discharged on a second main surface of said non-woven
fabric to freely egress from said first main surface;
means for applying a coating of adhesive to a main
surface of said liquid-impervious barrier layer, which is

opposite to said non-woven fabric in order to releaseably
retain the panty liners to undergarment material;
means for applying on said coating of adhesive a
removable protective web for protecting said coating of

adhesive while the panty liners are not in use; and
means for cutting said non-woven fabric, said
liquid-impervious barrier layer and said removable

protective web into individual panty liners.
