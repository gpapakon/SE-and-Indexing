<CLAIMS>
A process for purifying a (meth)acrylic acid contaminated
with aldehydes, in which a primary amine or a salt thereof is

added to the (meth)acrylic acid and the (meth)acrylic acid is
separated from the mixture by distillation, wherein, in addition

to the added primary amine or its salts, at least one
organic sulfonic acid or one of its salts is added to the

(meth)acrylic acid contaminated with aldehydes, before the
treatment by distillation.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein up to 5 mol of primary
amine or a salt thereof are added per mole of aldehydic

impurities.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein up to 5 mol of
at least one organic sulfonic acid or of one of its salts are

added per mole of added primary amine compound.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein from 1
to 3 mol of primary amine or of a salt thereof are added per

mole of aldehydic impurities, and from 0.5 to 2 mol of at
least one organic sulfonic acid or of a salt thereof are

added per mole of added primary amine compound.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
added primary amine compound comprises hydrazine or a

hydrazine derivative.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
added primary amine compound comprises aminoguanidine or a

salt thereof. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the added primary
amine compound comprises aminoguanidine bicarbonate.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
added sulfonic acid compound comprises dodecylbenzenesulfonic

acid.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
(meth)acrylic acid contaminated with aldehydes is a crude

(meth)acrylic acid which has been produced by the catalytic
gas-phase oxidation method.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, which is carried
out continuously.
