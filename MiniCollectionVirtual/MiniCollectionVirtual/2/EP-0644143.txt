<ABSTRACT>
A transport device for sheet-like material stacked on transport pallets, with an undercarriage and with supporting members (6) attached thereto for grasping the transport pallet and with a lifting device (8) cooperating therewith, is to be developed in such a way that the individual and particularly uppermost sheets of the sheet stack raised via the transport pallet cannot slip out of place during accelerating or braking operations. For this purpose, there are mounted on the undercarriage in a manner capable of being thrown on at least two sheet-like clamping members (10) which act on opposite sides of the sheet stack and which, to secure the sheet stack, are thrown forcibly on to the outer sides of the sheet stack. For raising or lowering the sheet stack, these sheet-like clamping members are returned into an initial position, in which they do not touch the outer sides of the sheet stack.

<CLAIMS>
Transport vehicle for a pile of flat or sheet-shaped 
material (sheet pile) on a transport pallet 

consisting of a carriage frame (2) with wheels (3) 
wherein provided on the carriage frame (2) is a 

pallet receiving device and a transport securer for 
the sheet pile (5), wherein, as transport securer, 

there are arranged at least a pair of flat 
constructed clamping elements (10) which can be 

horizontally settable in the transport movement 
direction against the corresponding outer sides of 

the sheet pile (5) and as pallet receiving device, 
carrier elements (6) movable up and down of a 

lifting device are arranged, characterised by the 
following features: 


that carriage frame (2) has, seen transversely to 
the transport movement direction, a portal-shaped 

aperture between the front and rear wheels (3), 
the clamping elements (10) and the bearer elements 
(6) are arranged within the aperture, wherein the 

bearer elements can be brought into engagement with 
the transport pallet (4), and 
the wheels (3) of the portal-shaped carriage frame 
(2) are installed swivellably by 90Â° with respect to 

the transport device for moving them over the 
transport pallet (4). 
Transport vehicle according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the clamping elements (10) are 

installed on the carriage frame (2) by means of 
equal length thrust crank drives (11) with 

positioning means linked thereto. 
Transport vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that two bearer elements (6) with a 

number of pins (9) are installed liftably and  
 

lowerably on the carriage frame (2) in such a 
fashion that the transport pallet (4) can be engaged 

in each case via a bearer element (6) on two 
oppositely lying sides. 
Transport vehicle according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the bearer elements (6) are 

constructed as horizontally movable pins (9) which, 
via adjustment means, can be moved for grasping the 

transport pallet (4) with a part of their length 
below a carrier pallet of the transport pallet (4). 
Transport vehicle according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that for limiting the 

clamping force between the clamping elements (10) 
and the sheet pile (5), pressure sensors are 

provided.
