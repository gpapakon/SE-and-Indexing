<ABSTRACT>
The electrical device consists essentially of three main components, the printed circuit board (10), the housing base (11) and the housing cover (12). These three components are joined together in the region of an outer edge. For this purpose the housing base (11) and the housing cover (12) have securing or supporting sections (18, 25) running substantially parallel to the surface of the printed circuit board. To keep the number of taboo zones for securing or connecting the printed circuit board and the housing sections low, the longitudinal extent of the connecting points is very much shorter than the total length of the corresponding edges of the printed circuit board.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical device, particularly a switching and
control device, for vehicles having at least one circuit

board (10) which carries an electronic circuit and which
is arranged in a housing which, at least, consists of a

housing cover (12) and a housing bottom (11), housing
cover (12), housing bottom (11) and circuit board (10)

being permanently joined to one another by joining means
in the area of their outside edges, the joining means for

joining circuit board (10), housing bottom (11) and
housing cover (12) being arranged at individual joints

(14, 24) at the edge of the circuit board (10), and the
edge length of the joints (14, 24) being small in

comparison with the total edge length of the circuit
board (10).
Electrical device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the joining means consist of flanged-over

sections (27) of at least one of the two housing parts
(housing bottom 11, housing cover 12).
Electrical device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that at least one of the two housing

parts (housing cover 12, housing bottom 11) is constructed
as deep-drawn stamped sheet metal part.
Electrical device according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the housing cover (12) and the

housing bottom (11) and the circuit board (10) exhibit,
at least in the area of the joining means, parallel-extending

sections (18, 25) at which they rest on one
another.
Electrical device according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the parallel sections of housing cover 

(12) and/or housing bottom (11) are created by bending
away edge areas of the corresponding housing part.
Electrical device according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the bent-away edge areas of the housing

parts protrude towards the interior of the housing.
Electrical device according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that the housing bottom (11) and/or

the housing cover (12) exhibit mounting sections (24) or
support sectios (14) which are open towards the outside

in the area of the joints.
