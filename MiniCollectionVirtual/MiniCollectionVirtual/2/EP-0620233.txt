<ABSTRACT>
A poly(meth)acrylic acid dispersion containing an organic solvent as the outer phase, with a disperse phase containing particles having a mean particle size of from about 20 to 300 nm with low polydispersity, obtainable by free-radical polymerisation of (meth)acrylic acid and optionally up to 5% by weight of comonomers which cause cross-linking of the poly(meth)acrylic acid, in a nonpolar, organic solvent in the presence of stabilisers, costabilisers and initiators, where   (1) the stabiliser is a block copolymer comprising at least one block A and at least one block B, where block A has been formed by polymerisation of monomers containing vinyl groups, and block B is a polyoxyalkylene block, (2) the weight ratio between the stabiliser and (meth)acrylic acid plus any comonomers present is from about 1:3 to 1:100, (3) the costabiliser is water or an alkane diol having up to 3 carbon atoms, and (4) the weight ratio between the costabiliser and (meth)acrylic acid plus any comonomers present is at least 
>
/= 1:50 and at most 1:1, and   (5) the weight ratio between the outer phase and the inner phase is from about 100:5 to 100:70.
