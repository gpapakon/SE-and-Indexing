<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
delivery of a beneficial agent to a patient or into a
system for later delivery to a patient. More
specifically, the present invention relates to an
improved drug delivery system.For many applications, drugs can be mixed with a
diluent before being delivered, for example,
intravenously to a patient. The diluent can be, for
example, a dextrose solution, a saline solution, or even
water. To this end, many drugs are supplied in powdered
form and packaged in glass vials. Other drugs, such as
some chemotherapy drugs, are packaged in glass vials in
a liquid state.Powdered drugs can be reconstituted by utilizing a
syringe to inject liquid into a vial for mixing; the
syringe eventually withdrawing the mixed solution from
the vial. When a drug must be diluted before delivery
to a patient, the drug is often injected into a container
of diluent after it is reconstituted; a container can be
connected to an administration set for delivery to the
patient.Drugs may be packaged separate from the diluent for
various reasons. One of the most important reasons is
that many drugs do not retain their chemical and physical
stability when mixed with a diluent and thus cannot be
stored for any substantial period of time. Also, drugs
are often packaged separately from the diluent because
many companies that manufacture drugs are not engaged in 
the business of providing medical fluids and containers
for intravenous delivery, and vice versa.Therefore, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, or other
medical personnel must mix the drug and diluent. This
presents a number of problems. The reconstitution
procedure is time consuming and requires aseptic
techniques. The operator must provide the proper diluent
and a syringe before beginning. The reconstitution
procedure should be performed preferably or under
preferably sterile conditions. This requirement requires
the operator to be more cautious, thereby consuming more
time. Additionally, sterile conditions are often hard
to maintain. In some instances, a laminar flow hood may
be required under which the reconstitution procedure is
performed.A further concern is that some drugs, such as
chemotherapy drugs, are toxic. Exposure of the operator
to the drugs during reconstitution can be dangerous,
especially if the operator works with such drugs on a
daily basis and is repeatedly exposed to them.Although after a drug is reconstituted and withdrawn
into a syringe barrel, the drug can, in some instances,
be injected immediately into a patient, more

<CLAIMS>
A device for coupling a container (54), including a beneficial agent,
to a second member (64), the device comprising:-


a substantially hollow member (12) having a wall (14) dividing the
hollow member into first and second sections (16,18),
the first section (16) having a receiving portion (42) for receiving at
least a portion of a container (54) and the second section (18) being

connectable to a second member (64), and
a channel member (26,127,226) mounted in the wall (14) and
having openings (30,32) into the first and second sections (16,18), so as to

define a flow path (27) therebetween,

characterised in that:-
the first section (16) has means (50) for providing communication
between the interior of the container (54), received in said receiving portion

(42), and
the interior of the first section,
the first section (16) having walls (60) at least a portion of which
can be squeezed inwardly to force liquid from the first section (16) into

the container (54), in use.
The device of Claim 1 including a shell (28) circumscribing a
portion of the channel member (26) and defining a channel (34)

therebetween having a first opening (38) in the first section (16) and a
second opening (36) in the section (18). 
The device of Claim 2, wherein the opening of the channel member
(26) extends into the first section (16) a greater distance from the wall (14)

than the opening (38) of the shell (28).
The device of Claim 2, wherein the opening (30) of the channel
member in the first section (16) is at substantially the same level as the

opening (38) of the shell (28).
The device of Claim 2, 3 or 4, including a sheath (44) covering at
least the openings (32,36) to the second section (18) of both the channel

member (26) and the shell (38).
