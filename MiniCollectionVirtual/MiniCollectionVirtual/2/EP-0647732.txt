<ABSTRACT>
A circular knitting machine is provided that 
has a bed member and a needle cylinder including a 

cylinder base rotatably mounted to the bed member. The 
knitting machine also has a bearing assembly positioned 

between the bed member and the cylinder base for 
rotatable mounting of the bed member to the cylinder 

base. In alternate embodiments, the bearing assembly 
preferably includes a first race (
71
) slidably 
connected to either the cylinder base or the bed member 

and a second race (
72
) connected to either the cylinder 
base or the bed member and positioned adjacent and 

spaced-apart from the first race (
71
). First and 
second tracks are respectively mounted to the first and 

second races, and bearings are positionally supported 
by and between the first and second tracks so that the 

cylinder base freely rotates about the bed member. A 
thermal-expansion compensator is preferably integrally 

formed with either the cylinder base or the bed member 
and is positioned closely adjacent the corresponding 

race respectively connected to either the cylinder base 
or the bed member. The compensator is adapted for 

compensating for thermal expansion in the cylinder base 
during heating and cooling thereof. The compensator 

preferably includes a flexible flange integrally formed 
with either the cylinder base or the bed member and 

positioned closely adjacent the corresponding race. 
The race positioned closely adjacent the flexible 

flange is preferably slidably connected to the 
corresponding cylinder base or bed member so that 

slidably movement of the corresponding race responsive 
to heating and cooling of the cylinder base thereby 

moves the flexible flange.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circular knitting
machine, and more particularly to a circular knitting
machine having a needle cylinder rotatably mounted to a
bed member for rotation thereof about the bed member.Circular knitting machines are generally
considered a high precision type of knitting machine.
Some types of conventional circular knitting machines
have a needle cylinder which includes a cylinder base.
The cylinder base is conventionally seated in a
generally L-shaped bed and is supported in a rotatable
manner by a bearing assembly that is positioned between
the cylinder base and the L-shaped bed. The bearing
assembly conventionally includes pairs of annular wire
tracks and a plurality of ball bearings mounted between
the pairs of wire tracks.When this type of circular knitting machine
is in operation, the needle cylinder increases in
temperature particularly because the knitting tools
which are guided in the needle cylinder perform rapid
upward and downward movements. As the temperature in
the needle cylinder increases, the heat formed therein
is transferred from the needle cylinder to the cylinder
base causing thermal expansion in and around the
cylinder base. When the machine is stopped, however, 
the ambient atmosphere often cools the cylinder base.
A distortion occurs which is caused by these
temperature changes, i.e., temperature differential.
This distortion substantially affects the machine's
accuracy.In one attempt to solve this problem in this
type of circular knitting machine, as described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,489,573 by Engelfried et al. titled
"Circular Knitting Machine," the circular knitting
machine has an elastic support flange that moves the
position of one of the circular wire tracks of a pair
thereof responsive to pressure fluctuation (i.e.,
caused by the thermal expansion of the cylinder base)
between the circular wire track and ball bearings.
Another non-elastic support flange of the other
corresponding circular wire track is anchored in such a
way as to cooperate with the elastic support flange.
The spacing between the wire tracks of the pair is
increased and the wire tracks slide outwardly on the
ball bearings. The thermal expansion of the cylinder
base is thus compensated.In the above prior art type of circular
knitting machine, however, a preload or pretension is
applied to the bearing assembly in order to maintain
the machine accuracy. This results in an increased
machine torque and, hence, an excessive load to the
bearing assembly. This excessive load may cause damage
to
