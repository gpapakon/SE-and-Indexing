<ABSTRACT>
A composition incorporating a chlorine dioxide generating compound 
such as sodium chlorite into a polymer or oligomer film is coatable onto 

various substrates. Controlled release is accomplished by absorption of 
moisture from the environment. The chlorine dioxide so released acts as a 

biocide and a fumigant. To form the composition, the chlorite is dissolved 
into a hydrogen bonded phase containing a monomeric or polymeric amide or 

a monomeric or polymeric alcohol. This hydrogen bonded phase is then mixed 
with an incompatible apolar phase consisting of anhydride such as a polymer 

such as a maleic anhydride copolymer with olefin, or a grafted maleic 
anhydride-polypropylene polymer. Chlorine dioxide is released by direct 

reaction of the anhydride or hydrolzed anhydride with the chlorite anion across 
the phase boundary. Increasing the molecular weight of the phases, increasing 

the phase incompatibility and decreasing the concentration of anhydride will 
all decrease the chlorine dioxide release rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a composition for reducing
bacterial and fungal growth and repelling insects, and more particularly to
an ionomeric composition having biocidal or insect repelling releasing agent
and method for making same.Chlorine Dioxide ("ClO2") has been incorporated in polymer [JP
63,296,758, NOK Corp, 1988; CA 111 P120181s] and ceramic beads [JP
63,274,434, Enkler Busin.K.K., 1988; CA 111 P11975h], and in a calcium
silicate wrapped in non-woven cloth [JP 57,168,977, Enkler Busin.K.K.,
1982; CA 98 P77552] to be used as a deodorant. Food preservation is an
application where a gel form is preferred [JP-A-57022102, Diamaru Kogyo
Kaishi, Ltd., 1982; CA 97 22409]. Chlorine dioxide generating gels have
also been used as topical applications for disinfection [A.J. Kenyon, S.G.
Hamilton and D.M. Douglas, Am.J.Vet.Res., 45(5), 1101 (1986)]. Most attempts to generate chlorine dioxide involve acidification (and
or chlorination) of an aqueous solution of chlorite, acidification
(and/or reduction) of chlorates ["Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry, The
Halogens", Vol 3, R.C.Brasted, D. Van Nostrand Co., New York, 1954,
p134-142] or reduction of a chlorite solution with aldehydes [US 2,323,594,
Mathieson Alkali Works, 1943]. Typically the preparation involves mixing
component A (gel with suspended NaClO2) with component B (gel with
lactic acid) immediately prior to use. α-hydroxy carboxylic acids (citric,
tartaric, malic, glycolic) are especially useful for generating ClO2 by the
reaction:
H+ + NaClO2 → HClO2 + Na+5HClO2 → 4ClO2 + HCl + 2H2O
[Ger.Offen. 2,817,942, H.Allinger, 1979; WO-A-8808823, J. Mason,
1988, CA 110 P98205h]. Alternatively, NaClO2 and lactic acid have been
separately encapsulated in polyvinyl alcohol and then mixed with water to
generate ClO2 [Can. 959,238, Chemical Generators, 1974]. Formulations
involving sulfonic acids are also available [Europ. Pat. Appl. EP 287,074,
Alcide Corp., 1987; CA 111 P45299f].Another method for the production of chlorine dioxide employs
acetic anhydride in the reaction:
2NaClO2 + (MeCO)2O + H2O → ClO2 + NaCl + MeCOOH + H++MeCOONa + O2 (The unbalanced proton takes part in reaction 
Interestingly prehydrolysis of the anhydride to acetic acid prior to the
addition of chlorite produces no chlorine dioxide. Direct reaction of
chlorite with anhydride in the presence of water is obviously important in
the reaction [W. Masschelein, I and EC Prod. Res. and Dev., 6(2), 137
(1967)].This work suggests the possibility of storing chlorite in a complex
wi
