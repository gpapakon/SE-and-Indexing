<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process for controlling the detoxification of aqueous solutions containing cyanides and/or cyano complexes, in particular cyano zinc complexes, using a source of formaldehyde to form glyconitrile and a source of hydrogen peroxide for perhydrolysis of the glyconitrile. According to the invention, during the addition of the source of formaldehyde, the pH is kept constant at a pH in the range from 8.5 to 12 by addition of an acid and the addition of the source of formaldehyde is terminated when the pH no longer increases.

<CLAIMS>
Process for controlling the decontamination of aqueous
solutions, in particular waste water, containing

cyanides and/or labile heavy metal cyanocomplexes, in
particular zinc cyanocomplexes, comprising the steps


(i) continuous or periodic addition of a source of
formaldehyde to the aqueous solution to be

treated at a pH value in the range of 8.5 to 12,
during which free and liberated cyanide is

converted into glyconitrile, and then
(ii) perhydrolysis of the glyconitrile by continuous
or periodic addition of a source of hydrogen

peroxide at a pH value in the range of 8.5 to 12,
the redox potential being measured and the

addition terminated when, with the pH value
maintained constant, the redox potential no

longer increases,

characterised in that

during step (i) the pH value is maintained
substantially constant by pH-controlled addition of an

acid and the addition of formaldehyde is terminated
when the pH value is no longer raised thereby.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

in steps (i) and (ii) the pH value is adjusted to, and
maintained constant, within the range of 9.5 to 10.5.
Process according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that

the pH control is effected with the use of P-, PI- or
PID-controllers.
