<ABSTRACT>
Low power discharge preionizers, or species (34), are provided by a ionizable 
species generator (20) that preconditions a laser gas (18) to eliminate arcing in lasers 

(10), such as pulsed (high repetition rate) lasers (10). The present invention creates the 
species (34) in a low power discharge and the species (34) prevents initial arcs from 

occurring between high voltage electrodes (14, 14a) of the laser (10). The laser (10) 
comprises a pressure vessel (11) containing the laser gas (18), a fan (12) for circulating 

the laser gas (18), a heat exchanger (13), a catalyst (17a), and two high voltage 
discharge electrodes (14, 14a) for exciting the laser gas (18) to create lasing. A high 

voltage power source (21) is coupled to the electrodes (14, 14a) for providing a 
discharge voltage thereto. A primary auxiliary discharge source (19) is disposed 

adjacent to the electrodes (14, 14a) that is used as a preionizer that create a low density 
of charged particles in the main discharge volume to act as a uniform seed for the main 

voltage pulse derived from the electrodes (14, 14a). The ionizable species generator 
(20) is disposed in the pressure vessel (11) and provides a low power discharge that 

preconditions the gas (18) to eliminate arcing in the laser (10). A preionization 
discharge generated by the ionizable species generator (20) is used to generate species 

(34) that have low ionization potential. These easily ionized species are then preionized 
by ultraviolet radiation generated from the primary auxiliary discharge adjacent to the 

main discharge electrodes (14, 14a) to form a uniformly ionized background for the 
main discharge to work on. The low ionization potential species (34) replace the gas 

hydrocarbon contaminants that are adsorbed by the catalyst (17a). A method of 
eliminating arcing in the laser (10) is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention was made with Government support under Contract No. 
DAAA15-90-C-0024 awarded by the Department of the Army. The Government has 
certain rights in this invention. The present invention relates generally to pulsed lasers, and more particularly, 
to discharge stabilization of high repetition rate lasers. The assignee of the present invention has developed TEA CO2 lasers that 
provide high repetition rate (to 200 Hz) output in a compact, sealed package using a 
catalyst. However, this compact, sealed, high repetition rate TEA CO2 laser, and other 
such pulsed lasers that utilize a catalyst, suffer from discharge arcing in the first several 
shots just after turn-on from a quiescent state. The quiescent state may be as short as 
tens of seconds. Arc elimination is important for laser lifetime and to guarantee "first 
shot" capability in a high data rate situation. Heretofore, no means or method of 
suppressing initial arcing has been available. High repetition rate TEA CO2 lasers produce laser output by pumping a gas 
mixture with a high power electrical discharge that takes place between two accurately 
aligned and surfaced electrodes. Lasers of this type that operate sealed with a catalyst 
have the problem that when they are first turned on, discharge arcing occurs for the first 
several shots. These arcs are highly localized current paths that prevent laser emission 
and cause inordinate wear of the electrodes, with the danger of permanent electrode  
 
damage under similar repeated use. However, the initial arcs do generate preionizer 
species that stabilize subsequent discharges. The problem of initial shot arcing has been associated with high repetition rate 
(200 Hz) lasers that are compact, with relatively small gas ballast, and that operate 
sealed with a heterogeneous catalyst. In these lasers, neutral, low ionization potential 
hydrocarbons that are necessary for discharge stabilization are attached by the catalyst. 
The initial arcs produce low ionization potential species from the main gas constituents 
that replace the hydrocarbons. For very large lasers, operating at reduced repetition 
rates on the order of 20 Hz, initial shot arcing has generally not been a problem, but it 
is not yet known if the quality of laser output could be enhanced using the auxiliary 
discharge concepts of the present invention. Heretofore, a primary auxiliary discharge located adjacent to the electrodes has 
been used to preionize low density hydrocarbons that then act as a uniform background
