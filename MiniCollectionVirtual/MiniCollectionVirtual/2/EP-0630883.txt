<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the improved process for
preparing N-alkyl-3,4-dialkyl-2,6-dinitroanilines. The
present invention more particularly concerns a commercially
viable process to prepare the compound pendimethalin,
(known by the chemical name N-(1-ethylpropyl)-2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine)
its derivatives and its intermediates.Pendimethalin and its derivatives are reported by United
States Patent Number 4,066,441 as excellent pre-emergent
herbicides.Several procedures are reported in the literature to prepare
these compounds. The last step in preparing the compound
pendimethalin is reported by US 3,920,742 to involve the
nucleophilic substitution of 3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitrohalobenzene
(especially the chloro derivative) with the
appropriate amine, thus:

where the chloro-intermediate was prepared in one of
several problematic multi-step processes beginning with
o-xylene, as follows:o-Xylene is first chlorinated to form 4-chloro-o-xylene,
which in turn is nitrated with fuming nitric acid to give the
3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-chlorobenzene in a yield of 27%.
First of all, the low yield is not commercially viable.
Secondly, the chlorination step affords a mixture of chloro
isomers, requiring the distillation of the product mixture to
separate the 4-chloro- isomer from its 3-chloro isomer with
only great difficulty due to their very close boiling points.
Finally, the low yield of the nitration step stems from the
need to purify the 3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-chlorobenzene
from dangerous higher nitrated by products. This alone makes
this process difficult for commercialization.A second process, illustrated by US 4,123,250, involves
nitrating 3,4-dimethylaniline to form 3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitroaniline
which is then reacted via a Sandmeyer
reaction to form 3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-chlorobenzene.
This process suffers from low yields and requires the
laborious separation from various by-products.A third process, illustrated by US 4,199,669 and US
4,261,926, is based on the reductive alkylation of
3,4-dimethylaniline with a ketone or directly from
4-nitro-o-xylene, thus: 

and the product is subsequently nitrated with concentrated
nitric acid to give the 2,6-dinitro derivative. This process
suffers from the fact that the preparation of the
4-nitro-o-xylene always is accompanied by the 3-nitro
derivative, and their separation is very difficult.Several improvements have been reported in attempts to
overcome the above described problems. Thus, US 3,929,916 and
US 3,929,917 disclosed the use of mercury salts or
