<ABSTRACT>
In a premixing burner for operating an internal combustion engine, a combustion chamber of a gas turbo group or a combustion plant, which can be used for the combustion of fuels with widely differing properties, a diffusor (4) is arranged downstream of a swirl generator (1), a converging part (2) and a throat (3) for the supply of the fuel (9), the converging part (2), the throat (3) and the diffusor (4) being of rotationally symmetrical design and the cross-sectional shape being adapted in such a way that no flow separation at the wall is possible.

<CLAIMS>
Premixing burner for the operation of an
internal combustion engine, a combustion chamber of a

gas turbine group or a firing system, comprising a
swirl generator (1) for combustion air (10), a

convergent part (2) adjoining it, a throat (3) for the
supply of liquid fuel (9) by means of a central lance

(11) and a diffuser (4) arranged downstream, in that
the swirl generator (1) is a double-cone burner with an

adapted slot width and with the injection of fuel
missing, and in that supply openings (13) for further

fuels (9) are arranged in the throat (3), some of the
supply openings (13) being radially aligned and

intended for the supply of gaseous, pulverized or
liquid fuel (9) and at least some of the supply

openings (13) being tangentially aligned and intended
for the supply of at least one further gaseous fuel

(9).
Premixing burner according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the convergent part (2), the

throat (3) and the diffuser (4) have a rotationally
symmetrical configuration.
Premixing burner according to Claim 1 and 2,
characterized in that the variation in cross section is

adapted in such a way that no flow separation is
possible at the wall.
Premixing burner according to Claim 1 and 2,
characterized in that the premixing burner can be

completely cooled convectively.
Premixing burner according to Claim 1 and 2,
characterized in that it is mainly the diffuser (4)

which can be cooled convectively.
Method for operating a premixing burner
according to Claim 1, characterized in that, when

operating with gaseous fuels which have a high flame
speed, the fuels are introduced via the openings (13)

in the throat (3) in the opposite direction to the
swirl direction of the combustion air (10), in that 

when operating with gaseous fuels which have a low
flame speed and a low calorific value, the fuels are

introduced via the openings (13) in the throat (3) in
the same direction as the swirl direction of the

combustion air (10) and in that, when operating with
liquid or pulverized fuel, the fuel is introduced into

the swirled combustion air (10) in the throat at right
angles to the flow direction or shortly before the

throat (3) by means of the central lance (11).
