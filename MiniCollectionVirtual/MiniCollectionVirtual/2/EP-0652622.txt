<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the construction of a
thin structure motor for driving a medium used in a
magnetic disk drive unit or an optical disk drive unit, the
production method thereof, and the laminated core and the
production method thereof.Fig. 139 shows the stator of the spindle motor for the
disk drive unit disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
No. 5-39020. The same Figure shows a stator core 20 formed
integratedly by punching the magnetic material and stator
coils 2 which are wound around respective teeth of the
stator core 20 so that they are contained in respective
slots. The spindle motor using this stator core 20 is
called inner rotor type. Inside the stator, a rotor and
rotor magnets are disposed so as to face the stator. The
structure of the inner rotor makes it possible to form a
thin structure motor and therefore is suitable for a
magnetic disk drive unit and optical disk drive unit which
are required to be of compact and thin structure.Figs. 140, 141 show a stator of the spindle motor for
the disk drive unit disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.2- 133055 and the magnetic pole tooth of the stator
core, respectively. Fig. 140 shows the stator core formed
integratedly by punching magnetic material and Fig. 141
shows a magnetic tooth 15 of the stator core, which is 
wound with stator coil 2. The spindle motor using this
stator core is called outer rotor type. Outside the
stator, a ring like rotor and rotor magnets are disposed so
as to face the stator. A rotor shaft is located in the
center of the stator and the rotor shaft is connected to
the ring like rotor magnet through a thin circular plate.
The spindle motor having such structure also makes it
possible to obtain small diameter and thin structure, and
therefore is often used as the spindle motor for driving a
magnetic disk drive unit or an optical disk drive unit.Figs. 142A, 142B, 143A, 143B show part of the stator
cores of other spindle motors for the disk drive unit
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.2-133055. The
spindle motor using this stator core is also of outer rotor
type. A difference thereof from the aforementioned outer
rotor structure is that part of the respective magnetic
teeth can be separated. In the stator core shown in Figs.
142A, 142B, slot heads 15-2 are inserted into the magnetic
teeth wound with the coil 2. In the stator core shown in
Figs. 143A, 143B, respective magnetic teeth 15-3 wound with
the coils 2 are inserted into the stator body 15-1.Fig. 146 shows the structure of a motor for the
mag
