<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for stiffening and/or correcting a spinal section consisting of at least two vertebrae, comprising at least two screw-shaped supports (12) securable to one of the vertebrae of the spinal section to accept and secure a compression or traction shaft (32) interconnecting the supports (12). The compression or traction shaft (32) consists especially of a rod-like connecting component (20), arranged between two neighbouring supports (12) and at least one spacer (34, 34', 34'', 34''', 34'''') movably acceptable by the rod-like connector (20), arranged between two neighbouring supports (12) and spacing said supports (12) apart. The connector (20) has a thread (38) at one end (36) and, at the other end (42), also has a thread (44) or possibly a flange-like thickening (50) or the like for securing or tensioning supports (12) and spacer (34, 34', 34'', 34''', 34'''').

Device for stiffening and/or correcting a section 
of the spine which consists of at least two vertebrae, 

the device comprising at least two screw-shaped holding 
arrangements (12) which can in each case be fastened to 

one of the vertebrae of the section of the spine for the 
purpose of receiving and securing a compression or 

distraction rod (32) which connects the holding 
arrangements (12) to one another, characterized in that 

the compression or distraction rod (32) is made up of a 
rod-shaped connection element (20) which can be received 

by the holding arrangements (12), and of at least one 
spacer element (34, 34' 34'', 34''', 34'''') which can be 

received in a displaceable manner by the rod-shaped 
connection element (20), is arranged between two adjacent 

holding arrangements (12) and keeps these holding 
arrangements (12) at a distance from one another, the 

connection element (20) being provided at one end (36) 
with a thread (38) and being provided at the other end 

(42) likewise with a thread (44) or a flange-like 
thickening (50) for securing or clamping together the 

holding arrangements (12) and spacer element (34, 34', 
34'', 34''', 34''''). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the end faces (52) of the two ends (54, 56) of the 

at least one spacer element (34) coincide with the plane 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spacer 

element (34). 
Device according to Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized in that one of the end faces (52') of the  

 
tw
o ends (54', 56') of the at least one spacer element 
(34') coincides with the plane perpendicular to the 

longitudinal axis of the spacer element (34'), and one of 
the end faces (52') of the two ends (54', 56') of the at 

least one spacer element (34') coincides with a plane 
other than the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal 

axis of the spacer element (34'). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the end faces (52'') of the two 

ends (54'', 56'') of the at least one spacer element 
(34'') coincide with a plane other than the plane 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spacer 
element (34''). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the spacer element (34, 34', 

34'', 34''', 34'''') is designed having a different 
length. 
Device according to at least one of Claims 2 to 
5, characterized in that the end faces (52, 52', 52'', 

52''', 52'''') of each spacer element (34, 34', 34'', 
34''', 34'''') are roughened for bearing in a 

rotationally stable manner on the holding arrangement(s) 
(12) and/or the adjacent spacer element(s) (34, 34', 

34'', 34''', 34''''). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the end faces (52, 52', 52'', 

52''', 52'''') of each spacer element (34, 34', 34'', 
34''', 34'''') are provided with approximately radially 

extending grooves, notches or the like and projections or 
the like for bearing in a rotationally stable manner on 

the holding arrangement(s) (12) and/or the adjacent 
spacer element(s) (34, 34', 34'', 34''', 34''''). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the at least one spacer element 

(34''') has an outer circumference with a wrench face for 
turning the spacer element (34''') by means of a tool, in 

particular a spanner. 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that a further rod-shaped connection
