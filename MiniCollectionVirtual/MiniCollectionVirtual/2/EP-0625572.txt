<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method of providing a cDNA containing the 
whole of the information on the primary structure of a protein by selectively 

synthesizing only the complete-length cDNA that contains a sequence beginning 
with the cap site of a mRNA. The process for producing an intermediate 

for the synthesis of the complete-length cDNA comprises the step of treating 
a mRNA extracted from cells with an alkaline phosphatase to eliminate the 

phosphate group from the 5' end of an uncapped incomplete-length mRNA, 
the step of decapping from the 5' end of a capped complete-length mRNA, 

and the step of linking the 5'-end phosphate group formed in the above step 
to either the DNA oligonucleotide represented by the following ge
neral formula 
(I) or a DNA-RNA chimera oligonucleotide by means of a T4RNA ligase 

to selectively add the DNA oligonucleotide or DNA-RNA chimera oligonucleotide 
having an arbitrary sequence to the 5' end of the complete-length 

mRNA: 5'-dN₁-dN₂-

a deoxyribonucleotide selected from among dAMP, dCMP, 

dGMP and dTMP; N represents a ribonucleotide selected from among 
AMP, CMP, GMP and UMP; "-" represents a phosphoric ester linkage;

linking a double-stranded DNA primer having a dT tail by annealing to 
the poly (A) tail of the 3' end of the complete-length mRNA having the 5' 

end to which the DNA oligonucleotide or DNA-RNA chimera oligonucleotide 
have been added as described above, and then synthesizing a single-stranded

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
synthesizing a full-length cDNA from mRNA. This
invention enables screening of proteins useful in
industry and mass production of the proteins.Bio-active proteins produced by cells have been
widely utilized in industry as materials for medicines,
diagnosis, biosensors, bio-reactors and so on. The
progress of gene technology has facilitated the discovery
of these proteins and enabled us to produce a large
amount of the proteins. The fundamental technology is a
cDNA cloning technique.Information on the amino acid sequence of a protein
is encoded by mRNA. If the mRNA is converted to a
corresponding DNA, i.e., a complementary DNA (cDNA), the
cDNA can be used for determining the primary structure of
the protein and producing a large amount of the protein.
Therefore, there have been developed various cDNA cloning
techniques which include isolating a mRNA from cells,
synthesizing cDNAs from the mRNA, and isolating a CDNA
encoding a target protein.The most important requisite for cDNA cloning is to 
synthesize a cDNA containing an entire protein coding
region encoded by an intact mRNA. The intact mRNA
contains a characteristic structure at the 5' terminal,
so called a cap. The cDNA containing an entire sequence
involving from the nucleotide at which the cap is added
is called a "full-length cDNA". If a full-length cDNA is
synthesized, we can know the whole information on the
primary structure of a protein and also use it for the
mass production of the protein encoded by the cDNA.
According to the conventional terminology, a "full-length
cDNA" have been used as a cDNA containing an entire
coding region of the protein even if the cDNA contains no
cap site sequence. In this invention, however, a "full-length
cDNA" is defined only as a cDNA containing a
nucleotide sequence starting from the cap site.The Gubler-Hoffman method [Gene 25:263-269(1983)],
which is most widely used for cDNA synthesis, could not
give a full-length cDNA, because deletion at the
terminals of cDNA occurs. On the other hand, the
Okayama-Berg method [Mol.Cell.Biol. 2:161-170(1982)] is
known to give a full-length cDNA at high efficiency. The
characteristic of this method is to add a dC tail to the
3' end of the first strand cDNA synthesized from mRNA.
This method, however, does not always give a full-length
cDNA, because dC tailing also occurs to the truncated
cDNA generated by unexpected termination of cDNA
synthesis. The truncated cDNAs originated from the 
degraded mRNAs are also synthesized.It
