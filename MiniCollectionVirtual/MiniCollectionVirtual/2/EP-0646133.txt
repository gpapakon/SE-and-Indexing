<DESCRIPTION>
 CLARIFIED AND COLD-MELT KONJAC GLUCOMANNANThis invention relates to clarified konjac (that is, purified glucomannan derived from konjac) and methods for preparing the same. It includes clarified konjac powders as well as sols and gels prepared therefrom. The clarified konjac glucomannan has enhanced purity and a low nitrogen content, and aqueous sols and gels thereof have low turbidity. This invention also relates to aspects of the clarified konjac including a cold-melt product and to methods for making the above products as well as varying the clarified konjac viscosity.Konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) is a plant, the tuber of which is the source of a well-known foodstuff in China and Japan, namely konjac flour. This flour, which contains a variety of insoluble materials described below as well as a major amount of desirable water-soluble substances, comprises a highly viscous sol of glucomannan and soluble starches when reconstituted in water. The principal soluble constituent is glucomannan, a polysaccharide comprised of D-glucose and D-mannose, which is useful as an ingredient in various foodstuffs, as well as in industrial applications such as films, oil drilling fluids, and paints.There are numerous impurities in crude (native, unclarified) konjac flour, principally insoluble starches, cellulose, and nitrogen-containing materials, including proteins, many of which impurities are derived from "sacs" which encapsulate the konjac flour in the tuber. As a result, the sols and gels of crude konjac flour have a highly turbid, milky-white or cloudy appearance (due to water-swollen particulate impurities) . U.S. Patent 3,928,322 to Sugiyama et al. (and U.S. 

 3,973,008, which is cumulative thereto) disclose a method for producing konjac mannan polysaccharide, i.e. glucomannan, which comprises the principal ingredient of konjac flour, from raw konjac flour by first removing insoluble components from an aqueous konjac flour sol by filtration or other conventional means, thereafter dialyzing the sol and subjecting the resulting liquid to freeze-drying to obtain a turbid, cotton-like, low density fibrous product which is hard to grind and poorly soluble in water.Japanese Patent Disclosure 01-49657, filed March 1, 1989, discloses a konjac mannan product which has a nitrogenous component of not more than 0.2%. However, the method of achieving this reduced nitrogen content is not disclosed but appears to be by simple dilution. U.S. Patent 2,144,522 teaches a method for decolorizing and clarifying galactomannan
