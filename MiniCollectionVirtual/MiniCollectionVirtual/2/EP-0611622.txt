<ABSTRACT>
A parting and/or grooving tool includes a support blade 
(10) and a cutting insert (12) removably securable in a 

recess (11) formed by upper and lower jaws (10a, 10b) 
at the front portion of the blade. The insert is 

clamped into place by a screw (23) which engages in a 
slot (19) that extends at an angle in relation to the 

longitudinal axis of the recess (11) such that the 
upper jaw (10a) is subjected to an elastic bending of 

such nature that a downwardly directed clamping force 
is exerted towards the upper surface of the cutting 

insert (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting
tool for chip cutting machining of metallic workpieces,
preferably for parting and grooving operations.US-A-3 785 021 discloses a cutting tool of the
aforesaid type comprising a support blade, the front
portion of which is provided with a recess for
receiving a cutting insert. The recess forms upper and
lower jaws having a bottom support surface and an
integral upper clamp surface which can be actuated so
as to be brought into clamping contact with the cutting
insert. The insert is clamped by means of the spring-load
that arises from bending the upper jaw upwards in
cantilever fashion upon insertion of the insert into
the recess. In order to release the insert from the
recess, a special tool is inserted into the recess at a
location behind the insert and urge the clamp
outwardly.Such a clamping, however, has been found to be
unstable under certain conditions, e.g., under the
influence of large cutting forces and heavy vibrations.Another cutting tool for parting and grooving
operations is disclosed in US-A-4 357 123. According to
this construction, the fastening means for the cutting
insert have to be actuated in a direction which is
perpendicular to the plane of the blade. This makes it
less easily accessible. Moreover, also this
construction has been found unstable under the
influence of large cutting forces and heavy vibrations. Still another cutting tool for parting and
grooving operations is disclosed in DE-U-89 15 043, cf.
in particular Fig. 3,
on which is based the preamble of claim 1.
According to this construction,
an upper jaw portion of an insert support blade may be
cantilevered by means of a press screw. However, this
upper jaw portion is completely unsupported by any
holder body. Thus, the blade is relatively long and
thin which makes it prone to vibrations.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a tool in which the insert can be clamped into
its mating recess in a support blade by actuation of a
clamping device of such nature that the insert can, 
with greater certainty, maintain its position in a
clamped position even under the influence of large
cutting forces and heavy vibrations in such tool.It is another object to provide a toolholder
which facilitates the clamping of inserts in various
holders with mainly the same clamping force.It is a further object of the present
invention to improve the clamping ability towards the
insert while minimizing the risk of tool failure.These objects are achieved with a metal
cutting tool according
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A metal cutting tool comprising a holder body (34),
a support blade (10), and fastening means (16, 17, 18)

for removably fastening the rear part of said support
blade to said holder body, said support blade (10)

having a front end defined by upper and lower jaw
portions (10a, 10b) spaced apart by an insert-receiving

recess (11), a front end of said recess being open to
receive an insert (12), said upper jaw portion (10a)

being elastically flexible in cantilever fashion to
impart a clamping force to the insert (12) disposed in

said recess (11), a first slot (19) formed in said
blade in spaced relationship to a rear end of said

recess (11) and forming an oblique angle relative to a
longitudinal axis of said recess, a second slot (11c)

formed in said blade and extending from said rear end
of said recess (11), a rear end of said second slot

being spaced from a forward end of said first slot by a
portion (33) of said blade, an actuating means (23)

mounted in said blade (10) so as to intersect said
first slot (19) and be engageable with a wall of said

first slot, whereby said actuating means can be pushed
against said wall of said first slot for elastically

bending said upper jaw portion (10a) to impose said
clamping force against the insert (12) in said recess,


characterized in that
 said second slot (11c) is
generally aligned with said first slot (19) and in that

a rear part of said upper jaw portion overlaps with
said holder body (34). 
Cutting tool according to claim 1, wherein a
distance from said front end of said first slot (19) to

said actuating means (23) is greater than a distance
from said rear end of said second slot (11c) to the

rear end of said recess (11).
Cutting tool according to claim 1, wherein said
oblique angle is an obtuse angle.
Cutting tool according to claim 3, wherein said
obtuse angle is from 130 to 160Â°.
Cutting tool according to claim 1, wherein said
actuating means includes a screw (23) threadedly

mounted in said blade (10) and defining means for
pushing said actuating means in response to rotation of

said screw (23).
