<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a bearing seat for a half-shell bearing in a metal part is disclosed, in which the metal part is produced by a forging or casting operation while simultaneously forming a half-shell-shaped recess, the diameter of which is slightly less than that of the half-shell bearing. The recess is then worked by non-cutting shaping until the diameter of the recess corresponds to that of the half-shell bearing. This method is distinguished by very low costs and in addition can also be used in restricted space conditions.
