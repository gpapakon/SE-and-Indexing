<ABSTRACT>
An overfill prevention valve (12) is provided in the fill line of a tank (2). 
The valve (12) is arranged such that the valve (12) is held at a closed 

position unless an overflow for the tank is open. 
When the overflow plug (24) is removed from the outlet (22) causes the 

inlet (26) to be in fluid communication with the valve outlet (14) and 
allows the distribution network (16) and the tank (2) to be filled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an overfill prevention valve. Such a
valve is suitable for use in filling a tank or reservoir to a level determined
by an outlet, such as an overflow, which, in normal use, is closed except
during filling of the tank.Known self contained liquid circulation systems, such as oil cooling
and/or lubrication systems, generally require a predetermined volume of
fluid to be admitted into a tank (herein including a reservoir or a sump).
Furthermore, the tank may not be filled directly, but the liquid may pass
through a distribution network thereby priming the network before
flowing into the tank. In such systems, it is known to fill the tank up to
a level determined by a standpipe or some other overflow arrangement
which is normally closed.Overfilling may occur if the overflow is inadvertently left closed during
the filling operation. Such overfilling may give rise to increased
churning of the liquid which may affect equipment performance and lead
to elevated temperatures and internal pressures.US-4883148 discloses a filling valve according to the preamble of claim 1
for use with an engine oil reservoir
which has an overflow drain passage closure member which must be
removed in order to gain access to an inlet passage closure member.
However, nothing prevents replacement of the closure member after the
inlet passage has been opened, and thus there is no positive prevention
of overfilling. According to the present invention there is provided an overfill
prevention valve for use in conjunction with a fluid reservoir having a
fluid inlet and a fluid overflow, the valve comprising a valve body having
a first inlet for connection to a fluid supply, a first outlet for connection
to said reservoir inlet in use, a second inlet for connection to said
reservoir overflow in use, and a second outlet, there being an overflow
passage establishing fluid flow communication between the second inlet
and the second outlet, the valve further including a valve member
moveable between an open position in which the first inlet has fluid
flow communication with the first outlet and a closed position in which
said communication is prevented, and, an overflow plug removably
closing the second outlet and having a mechanical interrelationship with
said valve member such that when the plug is in position closing the
second outlet it holds the valve member in said closed position.Preferably said plug has an extended portion which, when the plug is
closing the second outlet, abuts a portion of the valve
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An overfill prevention valve (12) for use in conjunction with a
fluid reservoir (2) having a fluid inlet (4) and a fluid overflow (18), the

valve (12) comprising a valve body having a first inlet (26) for connection
to a fluid supply, a first outlet (14) for connection to said reservoir inlet

(4), a second inlet (20) for connection to said reservoir overflow (18), and
a second outlet (22), the valve (12) further including an overflow plug

(24) removably closing said second outlet (22), and a valve member (28)
moveable between an open position in which said first inlet (26)

communicates with said first outlet (14) and a closed position in which
fluid flow communication between said first inlet (26) and said first outlet

(14) is prevented, the valve (12) being characterized by an overflow
passage i
n said valve body interconnecting said second inlet (20) and
said second outlet (22), and a mechanical interrelationship between said

plug (24) and said valve member (28) whereby said plug (24) when
closing said second outlet (22) holds said valve member (28) in said

closed position preventing fluid flow communication between said first
inlet (26) and said first outlet (14).
An overfill prevention valve as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that the plug (24) has an extending portion (46) which,

when the plug (24) is positioned to close said second outlet (22), abuts a
portion (40) of the valve member (28) and holds the valve member (28)

in said closed position.
An overfill prevention valve as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that the valve member (28) is biased towards said open 

position for permitting fluid flow communication between the first inlet
(26) and the first outlet (14).
An overfill prevention valve as claimed in Claim 3,
characterized by a spring (45) arranged to urge said valve member (28)

towards said open position.
