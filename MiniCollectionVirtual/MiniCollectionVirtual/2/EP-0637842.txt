<ABSTRACT>
An LC element, semiconductor device and a manufacturing method 
thereof whereby a channel 22 is formed by applying a voltage 

to a gate electrode 10 having a predetermined shape formed on 
a p-Si substrate 30 via an insulation layer 26, whereby a 

connection is formed between a first diffusion region 12 and 
a second dif
fusion region 14 formed at separated positions 
near the surface of the p-Si substrate 30; both the channel 

22 and gate electrode 10 function as inductors, and between 
these a distributed constant type capacitor is formed, and 

possessing excellent attenuation characteristics over a wide 
band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an LC element capable of
attenuating a predetermined frequency band and used either as
part of a semiconductor or other device, or as a discrete
element, and a method for manufacturing such a semiconductor
device and LC element.The rapid advancement of electronics technology in recent
years has brought about the use of electronic circuits in an
increasingly broad range of fields. Therefore, stable
operation of these electronic circuits is sought without being
affected by external conditions.However, these types of electronic circuits are directly
or intermittently subject to the incursion of external noise.
Consequently, a problem exists whereby operating error is
caused in electronic products using these electronic circuits
in not a few cases.In particular, there are many cases of using switching
regulators as electronic circuit DC power supplies. As a
result of transient current produced by such operations as
switching, and by load fluctuations arising from switching
operation of utilized digital ICs, noise having many frequency
components is often produced in the switching regulator power 
supply line. This noise is conveyed via the power supply line
or by radiation to other circuits in the same product, giving
rise to such effects as operating error and impaired signal to
noise ratio, and in some cases even causing operating error in
other nearby electronic products.Various types of noise filters are presently being used
with respect to electronic circuits in order to remove this
type of noise. In particular, since a great many electronic
products of numerous types have come into use in recent years,
the restrictions in regard to noise have grown ever more
severe, and development of an LC element having functions as
a compact high performance noise filter capable of reliably
removing such noise is desired.One example of this type of LC element is an LC noise
filter disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No.3-259608. In the case of this LC noise filter, the L and
C components exist as distributed constants, and compared to
an integrated constant type LC filter, favorable attenuation
response can be obtained over a relatively wide band.However, this LC filter comprises a capacitor type
conductor formed on one surface of an insulation sheet and an
inductor type conductor formed on the other surface.
Manufacturing the filter involves folding over this insulator
sheet, which is among the processes that add to manufacturing
complexity.Also, wiring is required
