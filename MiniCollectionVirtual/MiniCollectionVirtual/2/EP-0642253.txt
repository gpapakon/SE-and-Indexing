<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam printer includes a movable mirror which 
is rotated by a scan mirror motor. Laser light is 

alternately deflected toward an information reading 
station and an information writing station by applying the 

laser light to the movable mirror from a semiconductor 
laser. The laser light is switched between writing-use 

light and reading-use light at the time the movable mirror 
is rotated through a predetermined angle. In the laser 

beam printer having the semiconductor laser which is used 
for both writing and reading information, information is 

written and read out during one rotation of the movable 
mirror. It is therefore possible to perform a reading 

operation and a writing operation simultaneously by simply 
switching the laser light at the predetermined time 

depending on the rotation angle of the movable mirror.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical scanning
apparatus such as a laser beam printer and a laser fax
machine using, for example, an electrophotographic system.In an optical scanning apparatus such as a laser beam
printer having a document reading function, writing and
reading of information are usually performed using a
single laser light source. For example, the following two
methods have been proposed. One is a method for changing
the optical path of laser light by changing the angle of a
reflecting mirror positioned on the optical path (see U.S.
Pat No. 4,573,084). The other is a method for dividing 
light into reading-use light and writing-use light by
positioning a half mirror on the optical path (see U.S.
Pat No, 4,386,374).First, with the method for changing the angle of the
reflecting mirror, as illustrated in Fig. 8, laser light
is first deflected when reflected by a rotating polygon
mirror 61. The deflected laser light goes through an f
correction lens 62 and reaches a movable reflecting mirror
63. When the reflecting mirror 63 is in a position
indicated by the solid line of Fig. 8, the laser light
which has been modulated according to a predetermined data
signal is guided to a surface of a photoreceptor 64 for
writing information. On the other hand, when the
reflecting mirror 63 is in a position indicated by the
alternate long and two short dashes line of Fig. 8, the
laser light illuminates a surface of a document 65.
Information is read out when reflected light from the
document 65 is received by a light receiving element 66.With the method in which a half mirror is positioned
on the optical path, as illustrated in Fig. 9, the laser
light is deflected by the rotating polygon mirror 61, goes
through the f correction lens 62 like in the
above-mentioned method, and reaches a half mirror 67. The
half mirror 67 divides the laser light into light which
goes through the half mirror 67 and light which is 
reflected by the half mirror 67. The laser light
reflected by the half mirror 67 illuminates the surface of
the document 65. When reflected light from the document
65 is received by the light receiving element 66,
information is read out. When reading information, a
douser 68 is disposed between the photoreceptor 64 and the
half mirror 67 so as to stop the laser light which has
passed through the half mirror 67 from illuminating the
photoreceptor 64. On the other hand, when writing
information on the photoreceptor 64 using the laser light
which has passed through the half mirror 67, the
