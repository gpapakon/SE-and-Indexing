<ABSTRACT>
A rechargeable pocket lamp (1) detachably mounted in a support (7) inside a motor vehicle is automatically connected in the mounted state to the vehicle energy supply system for recharging at least one rechargeable battery (4). The pocket lamp (1) is provided with a lamp (13) which can be switched on by means of a switch (29) and which is arranged behind a transparent cover (2) set in a housing (18) of the pocket lamp. In order to increase the possibilities of use of the pocket lamp, the switch (29) has a knurled ratchet wheel (12) to which the lamp (13) is fixedly linked. When the ratchet wheel (12) is moved, at least one further transparent cover (3) in the housing (18) can be illuminated by the lamp (13). The possibilities of use of the pocket lamp (1) are further increased by providing the housing (18) with a swivellable permanent magnet (14) which can be locked in several positions.

Rechargeable torch to be detachably installed in 
a support in the interior of an automotive vehicle or 

the like, the torch being, in its installed position, 
automatically connected to the on-board power supply of 

the automotive vehicle for the charging of at least one 
rechargeable battery and being provided with a bulb 

which can be switched-on via a switch, said bulb being 
disposed behind a light-permeable cover inserted into a 

housing of the torch, characterised in that the switch 
(29) has a lockable rotary wheel (12), to which the bulb 

(13) is securely connected, and in that, when the rotary 
wheel is adjusted accordingly, at least one additional 

light-permeable cover (3) in the housing (18) can be 
illuminated by the bulb (13). 
Torch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the light-permeable covers (2, 3) are of different 

colours. 
Torch according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that one cover (2) is clear glass and the other cover 

(3) is amber-coloured. 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the clear-glass cover (2) is 

configured as a lens. 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the clear-glass cover (2), which 

is configured as the top wall of the rectangular housing 
(18), is secured in the upper region of a lateral wall 

(22) of the housing (18) via associated clip connections  
 

(26), and the amber-coloured cover (3) is secured 
therein via associated detachable clip connections (27). 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the bulb (13) is inserted in a 

radially conical recess (28), which is provided in the 
rotary wheel (12) and serves as the reflector, the 

rotary wheel (12) being provided with switching contacts 
(31, 33), which impinge on conductor paths of a printed 

circuit board (21). 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that all of the switching functions of 

the bulb (13) are controlled via the printed circuit 
board (21), which is fitted with corresponding component 

parts. 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the bulb (13) is switched as a 

flash bulb in its position associated with the 
amber-coloured cover (3). 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the rotary wheel (12) accommodates 

a spring-loaded locking element (39), which co-operates 
with a locking cam (40) secured to the housing and 

having three locking positions (I, 0, II), the bulb (13) 
being switched-off in the central locking position (0), 

in which the bulb (13) assumes a 45° position relative 
to the two covers (2, 3), and the bulb (13) being 

switched-on in the other remaining locking positions (I, 
II), in which the bulb (13) acts on either the 

clear-glass cover (2) or the amber-coloured cover (3).  
 
Torch according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the rotary wheel (12) is coupled 

laterally and securely to a switch wheel which acts on a 
lock bolt, which is guided in a spring-loaded manner at 

the housing end, in such a manner that, when the bulb 
(13) is in its switched-on state, the connection 

contacts (5) of the torch (1) are mechanically blocked 
by the lock bolt to prevent them entering the plug (20) 

disposed on the support (7). 
Torch according to the preamble of claim 1, 
characterised in that the housing (18) is provided with 

a pivotable permanent magnet (14), which is lockable in 
a plurality of positions. 
Torch according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the permanent magnet (14) is mounted in a recess 

(42), which is open towards the base (41) and the front 
wall (24) of the rectangular housing (18), and is, in 

consequence, pivotable through 90°. 
Torch according to claims 11 and 12, 
characterised in that the permanent magnet (14), which 

has a U-shaped cross-section, is provided with an 
enclosing plastics material coating (44), the free ends
