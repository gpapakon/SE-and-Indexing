<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a rotary cylinder machine in the form of a two-stroke internal combustion engine or a compressor in which a cylinder block (5) with several circumferentially distributed cylinders (13) rotate about a first axis (7). Three pairs of pistons (15) rigidly joined together by piston rods (17) with their stroke axes mutually staggered by 120  are guided on a crankshaft (21) arranged eccentrically to the first axis (7) and rotatable about a second axis (23). The piston rods (17) are also supported on three eccentric discs (25) fixed on the crankshaft (21) and also mutually staggered by 120 . The gas exchange takes place via preferably piston-controlled slots (51, 53) in the cylinders (13) closed on the outside by cylinder heads (33). In the gas exchange path of the slots (51, 53) there are rotary disc valve control devices (57), at least on the outlet side, which, when necessary, control the gas exchange together with the piston-controlled slots (51, 53). The gas may be fed in via rotary disc valve controls or an inlet passage opening into a crankshaft chamber of the rotary engine (5) may be provided which is connected to the inlet slots via overflow channels. In its embodiment as an internal combustion engine, there may be a blower driven by a variable-speed motor may be provided to control the degree of filling of the combustion chambers (37).
