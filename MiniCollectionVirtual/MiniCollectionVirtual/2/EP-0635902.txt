<ABSTRACT>
The self-stripping connector comprises a rectangular box structure with a contact terminal (10). The terminal includes two flanks which are folded up at right angles to the base, with inwardly projecting edges (32) defining a channel into which a cable may be inserted. A cable is inserted into this channel and a pair of tabs (16) at the end are folded over to retain it. The connector also includes a closed box section (24) open at one end, forming a female connector which can be fitted to a male terminal pin (12).

Single-piece contact terminal, having: 

a front contact part folded in such a way as to 
constitute a bottom (22) and two parallel and double-walled 

sides, one wall of which has an elastic contact 
strip which is turned inwards and which is held separate 

from the other strip and in initial prestress by a 
portion of the other wall so as to define a passage for 

inserting a complementary connector strip (12), and 
a rear part having two tabs (16) for crimping 
onto the insulation of a wire which are sufficiently long 

to be able to be crimped onto the insulation, 
 
characterized in that it further includes an intermediate 

part which is folded to present two parallel side walls 
(32) each equipped with two fins which are perpendicular 

to the elongate direction of the contact terminal and 
delimiting a passageway for cable insulation displacement, 

with cable insertion parallel to the plane of the 
bottom, in that the said crimping tabs (16) are parallel 

to the bottom and oriented parallel to the side walls, 
and in that the two sides are orthogonal to the said side 

walls. 
Electrical connection module, including an 
insulating shell (52) in which several parallel housings 

are formed, aligned in the same plane and open 
transversely to this plane, each containing a contact 

terminal (10) equipped with two side walls (32) oriented 
perpendicularly to this plane and delimiting a passageway 

for cable insulation displacement, the said passageway 
opening out towards the opening of the housing,  

 
characterized in that each of the contact terminals (10) 

is in a single piece and exhibits: 

a front contact part folded in such a way as to 
constitute a bottom (22), and two parallel and double-walled 

sides, one wall of which has an elastic contact 
strip which is turned inwards and which is held separate 

from the other strip and in initial prestress by a 
portion of the other wall so as to define a passage for 

inserting a complementary connector strip (12), the 
terminals being oriented in such a way that the elastic 

contact strips are parallel to the plane of alignment of 
the housings, 
an intermediate part folded so as to exhibit the 
two side walls (32), oriented orthogonally to the said 

plane and delimiting a stripping passageway (34), which 
opens out on the same side as the opening of the 

housings, and, 
a rear part having two tabs (16) for crimping 
onto the insulation of a wire, which are parallel to the 

bottom, and which are sufficiently long to be able to be 
crimped onto the insulation, oriented parallel to the 

side walls, 
the two sides of the front part of the terminal 
being orthogonal to the said side walls (32). 
Module according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the front part of each terminal constitutes a cage 

having a bottom adjoining two sides each having an inner 
wall and an outer wall which are connected to one another 

by a 180째 fold, each side exhibiting a fold at 90째 in 
such a way as to constitute a cage roof, one of the said 

side walls being in the extension of the roof and the 
other in the extension of the bottom, and the side walls 

having folds at 90째 orthogonal to the sides. 
Module according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that each side wall consists of a portion of the 

terminal having two folds at 90째 so as, for each 
terminal, to delimit two wire stripping passageways. 
Method of connecting a module according to Claim 
4 onto a flat cable, characterized in that a shell fitted  

 
with terminals is placed into an anvil (54) having a 

cavity for accommodating the shell (52); a flat cable is 
put in place; a hold-down clamp (58) equipped wi
th 
parallel partitions (60) which are intended to hold the 

cut out side walls, to prevent these side walls being 
moved apart and to cut the flat cable between the 

conductors of this cable is pressed against the anvil; 
punches (62) for engaging the insulated wires of the 

cable are pushed in, through the hold-down clamp, between 
the respective insulation-displacement side walls; 

punches (64) for crimping the tabs (16) onto the insulation 
of the wires are pushed in through the hold-down 

clamp; and the hold-down clamp is withdrawn.
