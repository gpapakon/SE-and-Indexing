<ABSTRACT>
A fastener for securing in garments has a flexible, thin, flat wall part (1) which can be attached to the garment and consists of a plurality of wall pieces (2, 3, 4), each of which has an overlapping part (2a, 2b; 3a, 3b; 4a, 4b) which overlaps an overlapping part of the adjacent wall piece, each overlapping part having an edge, of which a portion (2c, 3c, 4c) is attached to the overlapping part of the adjacent wall piece, and of which a further portion can be placed loosely against the overlapping part of the adjacent wall piece in order to close the securement and can be moved away from the overlapping part of the adjacent wall piece in order to open the securement. In order to design the opening of the fastener to be more variable in shape and size, the wall part (1) of the fastener consists of at least three wall pieces (2, 3, 4), each of which has two overlapping parts (2a, 2b; 3a, 3b; 4a, 4b), one of which lies over an overlapping part of the one adjacent wall piece, and the other lies below an overlapping part of the other adjacent wall piece, the edge portions (2c, 3c, 4c) lying loosely against the respective overlapping parts in the closed state of the securement intersecting at a point (5) located essentially in the centre of the surface of the wall part (1).

A closure for entry into articles of clothing, 
having a flexurally soft, thin, flat wall part (1) 

which is adapted to be fixed to the article of clothing 
and which consists of a plurality of wall pieces (2, 3, 

4) each of which has an overlap part (2a, 2b; 3a, 3b; 
4a, 4b), which overlaps an overlap part of the adjacent 

wall piece, each overlap part having an edge, a portion 
(2c, 3c, 4c) of which is fixed on the overlap part of 

the adjacent wall piece, and another portion of which 
is adapted to be loosely placed on the overlap part of 

the adjacent wall piece in order to close the entry, 
and is movable away from the overlap part of the 

adjacent wall piece in order to open the entry, 
characterised in that the wall part (1) consists of at 

least three wall pieces (2, 3, 4), each of which has 
two overlap parts (2a, 2b; 3a, 3b; 4a, 4b), one of 

which lies over an overlap part of an adjacent wall 
piece, and the other of which lies below an overlap 

part of the other adjacent wall piece, the edge 
portions (2c, 3c, 4c), which rest loosely against the 

associated overlap parts when the entry is closed, 
intersecting at a point (5) situated substantially in 

the middle of the surface of the wall part (1). 
A closure according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the loosely contacting edge portions (2c, 3c, 4c) 

of each wall piece (2, 3, 4) are rectilinear. 
A closure according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that each wall piece (2, 3, 4) is in two layers and 

is folded along the respective loosely contacting edge 
portions (2c, 3c, 4c).  

 
A closure according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the wall pieces (2, 3, 4) 

consist of a textile material. 
A closure according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the wall part (1) is fixed to a breast prosthesis 

pocket at the edge thereof facing the body. 
A closure according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the wall part (1) is fixed to the edge (7), facing 

the body, of a cup (8) of a prosthesis brassiere (9), 
said cup receiving a breast prosthesis. 
A closure according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the wall part is fixed to the edge, facing the 

body, of a bathing costume cup receiving a breast 
prosthesis.
