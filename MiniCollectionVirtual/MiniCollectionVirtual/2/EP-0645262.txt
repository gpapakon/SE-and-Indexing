<ABSTRACT>
Device for preventing the penetration of foreign 
matter and for allowing the application and retention of 

lubricant in self-orientating twin castors comprising a 
pair of wheels (14, 15) which are rotatably mounted on a 

spindle (6) driven through a seat (5) of a support (2) 
which is composed of a vertical wall (3) lying between the 

wheels and in which a vertical cylindrical recess (4a) is 
formed; the recess is open upwards for the rotational 

engagement of a stem (4b) for mounting the castor on a 
piece of furniture; two tubular portions (7, 8) are rigidly 

coupled to the opposite sides of the wall and are coaxial 
to the spindle (6); tubular bosses (16) rigidly coupled to 

the respective wheels (14, 15) protrude into the tubular 
portions (7, 8); a vertical blind recess (21) is 

furthermore formed in the wall and opens into the seat (5) 
above the spindle (6); a through bore (22) is also provided 

in the wall and is aligned with the blind recess (21) below 
the spindle; a spring (20) is accommodated in the recess 

(21) and acts on the spindle (6); the device is 
characterized in that it comprises elements (23-28) for 

closing the bore (22) and for preventing the leakage of 
lubricant through the tubular portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
preventing the penetration of foreign matters and for
allowing the application and retention of lubricant in
self-orientating twin castors of the type comprising a pair
of coaxial wheels.So-called twin castors are constituted by a pair of
wheels which are rotatably mounted on a spindle but axially
retained by annular ridges that engage grooves of the
spindle. The spindle is driven through a supporting seat
constituted by a vertical wall lying between the wheels and
by a sort of semicylindrical hood that covers the wheels in
their upper region. A cylindrical recess is formed in the
vertical wall, is open in the upper region, and acts as a
rotation seat for a vertical self-orientation stem to be
inserted and fixed in a seat of the piece of furniture to
which the castor is to be applied.Two tubular portions extend from both sides of the
wall and are coaxial to the spindle; the opposite ends of
said spindle extend into said portions. Said portions are
optionally internally provided with engagement elements in
order to axially retain the wheels. Said engagement
elements are constituted by semicircular teeth behind which
a flange engages; said flange is externally provided on a
boss which is rigidly coupled to the respective wheel. The
boss in practice acts as a bearing for the rotary support
of the wheel on the spindle. In some embodiments, the
tubular portions are constituted by a series of axial tabs 
which have, at their ends, teeth which are directed
inwardly to engage the flange of the wheels. Some types of
twin castor, meant to be mounted on chairs, are of the
self-braking type in order to keep the chair in position
when the user is about to sit thereon. In these castors,
the spindle supporting seat is vertically oblong, and the
braking effect is achieved by means of a spring
accommodated in a blind recess formed in the thickness of
the vertical wall and opening at the top of the seat. The
spring, which is inserted in the blind recess through a
lower through bore and the spindle seat, is strong enough
to produce, when only the weight of the seat bears on the
castor, a thrust on the spindle that moves said spindle
into a position in which the bosses of the wheels are in
sliding contact within the tubular portions, which prevent
their rotation.Twin castors of the above type are disclosed in
European publications no. 386 956 and 458 446 and in
British patent no. 2,025,220.In known twin castors there is the drawback that dirt,
dust, hairs and other matter

Device for preventing the penetration of foreign
matter and for allowing the application and retention of

lubricant in self-orientating twin castors constituted by a
pair of wheels (14,15) which are rotatably mounted on a

spindle (6) driven through a seat (5) of a support (2)
which is composed of a vertical wall (3) lying between said

wheels and in which a vertical cylindrical recess (4a) is
formed, said recess (4a) being open upwards for the

rotational engagement of a stem (4b) for mounting the
castor on a piece of furniture, two tubular portions (7, 8)

being rigidly coupled to the opposite sides of said wall
and being coaxial to said spindle (6), tubular bosses (16)

rigidly coupled to the respective wheels protruding into
said tubular portions, a vertical blind recess (21) being

furthermore formed in said wall and opening into said seat
(5) above said spindle (6), a through bore (22) being also

provided in said wall and being aligned with said blind
recess (21) below said spindle (6), a spring (20) being

accommodated in said recess (21) and acting on said spindle
(6); characterized in that a lubricant is provided in the

supporting region between the bosses (16) of the wheels and
the tubular portions (7, 8) of the support (2) and in that

it further comprises means for preventing the leakage of
lubricant through said tubular portions (7, 8) including

means for closing said bore (22) and a ridge (10a, 29) that
extends inside the opposite ends of said tubular portions

(7, 8) below said spindle (6) and between teeth (9, 10) for
retaining the wheels (14, 15).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said means for closing said bore comprise a plug (23)

having an annular external collar (24) that is adapted to
engage in an annular groove (25) of said bore (22).
Device according to any one or more of the
preceding claims for castors in which the tubular portions

(7, 8) have slots (12, 13) for the extraction of inserts
for forming the teeth (9, 10) for retaining the wheels (14,

15), characterized in that a cylindrical sector (26) whose
radius of curvature corresponds to the radius of curvature

of said tubular portions (7, 8) is rigidly coupled to said
plug (23), the opposite ends of said sector (26) having

ridges (27, 28) which, when said plug (23) is inserted in
said bore (22), rest so as to produce a seal on the outer

surface of said tubular portions (7, 8), forming a tray for
collecting any seepage of lubricant from the rotation

region through said slots (12, 13).
Device according to claim 2, characterized
in that said plug (23) has a through channel (31) in which

a closing pin (32) is inserted.
Device according to claim 4, characterized
in that said pin (32) has a conical head (33) which is

suitable to engage in a corresponding flared portion of
said cylindrical sector (26).
