<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic pressure regulators of the kind in which pressure and flow of 
air (or another gas) into a receptacle have to be tightly controlled. A particular example where the need arises for tight control of pressure and flow is in the supply 
of air to the inflatable bladders of an anti-G suit for a high performance fighter aircraft. The 
invention is also applicable to other cases where the pneumatic pressure to be regulated is 
subject to rapid changes, and where the pressure in the receptacle must accurately follow the 
changes. As a general rule, conventional pneumatic systems lend themselves to applications where forces 
change rapidly. The difficulty has been that pneumatic systems did not perform well where tight, 
accurate control of the rapidly changing forces is required. In a hydraulic system, the fact that the hydraulic fluid is incompressible permits the hydraulic fluid 
to be used as an incompressible, seemingly-solid, stable, force-transmitting column or strut. In a 
pneumatic system, on the other hand, the corresponding "strut" of air is not at all solid and 
stable, but is resilient and compressible to a marked degree. Hydraulic systems that have been 
developed for position-control, such as the linear-spool valves of the type used in hydraulic 
servo-systems, which provide a "solid" strut of a progressively variable or adjustable length, have 
no counterpart in the field of pneumatic pressure-control systems. The conventional view of hydraulic and pneumatic systems is that hydraulics are necessary if 
accuracy of position-control is required, whereas pneumatics are favoured if force control is 
required without a particular need for accuracy of position. Neither system is quite right if both 
stable position-control and accurate force-control are required. One disadvantage of hydraulic systems lies in the slowness with which the system takes up 
slack, and responds to changes in force. The low volumetric flow rate of the hydraulic liquid, as 
compared with air, is the limitation. The usefulness of hydraulic systems has therefore tended to 
be restricted to applications which require accurate position control at low fluid-flow rates. 
Hydraulic systems tend not to be favoured when the need is for moving large quantities of fluid. 
Even unsophisticated pneumatic systems on the other hand can quickly respond to changing 
force requirements, even if large quantities of fluid (air) need to be moved in order to change the 
force. However, one of the areas in which
