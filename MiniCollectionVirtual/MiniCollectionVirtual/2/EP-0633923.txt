A granular phosphate-free detergent additive containing 

(A) 10 to 70% by weight of sodium perborate monohydrate 
with an average particle size of 0.2 to 1.2 mm, 
(B) 25 to 80% by weight of a granular mixture with an 
average particle size of 0.2 to 1.2 mm of which at 

least 75% by weight is inorganic and free from 
peroxygen and which contains (based on water-free 

substance in component B) 45 to 75% by weight of 
synthetic finely crystalline zeolite, 0 to 30% by 

weight of sodium sulfate and 1 to 12% by weight of 
salts of homopolymeric or copolymeric carboxylic 

acids, 
(C) 5 to 30% by weight of nonionic surfactants fixed to 
the granular components (A) and (B), 
 
characterized in that (B) contains 2 to 10% by weight, 

based on the water-free substance in component (B), of a 
layer silicate. 
An additive as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
fraction with a particle size below 0.05 mm makes up less 

than 1% by weight and preferably less than 0.1% by 
weight, the fraction with a particle size below 0.1 mm 

makes up less than 2% by weight and preferably less than 
1% by weight, the fraction with a particle size above 2 

mm makes up less than 5% by weight and preferably less 
than 1% by weight and the fraction with a particle size 

above 1.2 mm makes up less than 10% by weight and preferably 
less than 5% by weight. 
An additive as claimed in claim 1 or 2 containing 20 
to 60% by weight and more particularly 30 to 50% by 

weight of component (A), 35 to 70% by weight and more 
particularly 40 to 60% by weight of component (B) and 7 

to 25% by weight and more particularly 10 to 20% by 
weight of component (C).  

 
An additive as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the sodium perborate monohydrate 

used has an apparent density of 450 to 650 g/l and 
preferably 500 to 600 g/l. 
An additive as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that 50 to 72% by weight (based on 

water-free substance) of component (B) consists of 
synthetic fine-particle zeolite containing bound water, 

0 to 30% by weight of sodium sulfate, 1.5 to 8% by weight 
of homopolymeric or copolymeric polycarboxylic acids 

(expressed as sodium salt) and 3 to 7% by weight of a 
layer silicate and also bound water. 
A process for the production of the additive claimed 
in one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a 

homogeneous dry mixture of components (A) and (B) is 
sprayed and at the same time mixed with a liquid component 

(C) or with a component (C) liquefied by heating. 
A powder-form to granular, phosphate-free to lowphosphate 
detergent, characterized by a content of the 

detergent additive claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5.
