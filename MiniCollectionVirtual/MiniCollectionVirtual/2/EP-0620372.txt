<ABSTRACT>
A fluid-powered cylinder is provided with a piston 6 which is movable in the interior space 2 of a cylinder body 3 via a fluid from a first stroke position in the area of a cylinder head 4 in a direction towards the area of a cylinder cap 5 into a second stroke position and has at least one piston rod 7. The respective stroke movement of the piston 6 can be controlled via the interaction of a magnet part 8 located on the piston periphery with at least one operating member 9 located on the outer periphery of the cylinder. In the area of movement of the piston 6, the cylinder body 3 is formed with at least one wall aperture 12 connecting the cylinder interior space 2 to the outer area and closed fluid-tight via a non-magnetizing filling member 11, and the operating member 9 is provided close to the wall aperture 12 on the outer periphery of the cylinder.

A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium and provided with a
working piston (6) comprising at least one piston rod (7) and adapted to be moved by a

fluid out of a first position in the region of a cylinder head (4) in a direction towards the
area of a cylinder bottom (5) and into a second position, its respective travelling

movement being controllable by the co-operation of a magnetic part (8) disposed on the
periphery of the piston with at least one switching member (9) disposed on the outside

periphery of the cylinder, characterised in that in the area of movement of the working
piston (6), the cylinder body (3) is constructed with at least one wall aperture (12) which

connects the cylinder interior (2) to the outside area and which is occluded in fluid-tight
manner by a non-magnetisable filling member (11) in the form of a receiving bush (13),

the switching member (9) being provided close to this, on the outer periphery of the
cylinder, the receiving bush (13) being welded to the cylinder body (3) and having in the

region (16) of the bottom an outer contour (22) which is substantially adapted to the
radius (21) ofthe cylinder interior (2), forming a gap-free transition to the inner peripheral

surface (23).
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to claim 1,
characterised in that with the lifting movement of the working piston (6), the magnetic

part (8) disposed thereon can be moved into a signal triggering position which influences
the switching member (9) and which is close to the bottom area (16) of the receiving bush

(13).
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the cylinder body (3) consists of a magnetisable material such as steel

and in that the filling member (11) consists of non-magnetisable chrome nickel steel.
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to one of claims
1 to 3, characterised in that a reed switch (10) is provided as the switching member (9). 
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to one of claims
1 to 4, characterised in that the magnetic part (8) is provided as a ring magnet formed

from soft-magnetic synthetic plastics material.
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to one of claims
1 to 5, characterised in that the receiving bush (13) is in the region of the outer contour

(22) machined jointly with the inner periphery of the cylinder body (3).
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to one of claims
1 to 6, characterised in that the reed switch (10) is fixed by an elastic damping material

in the region of an insertion aperture (25) of the receiving bush (13).
A working cylinder actuated by a pressurised medium, according to claim 7,
characterised in that an elastomer ring is provided in the insertion aperture (25) and

secures the reed switch (10).
