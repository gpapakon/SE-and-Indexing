<ABSTRACT>
A safety belt arrangement for the back seat of a motor vehicle includes three-point belts, the upper deflection points, which are provided at the height of the shoulders of the occupants of the rear seats being mounted on a deflection element which is arranged adjacent to the middle of the vehicle. In order to be able to provide three-point belts in the region of the rear seat structure of a motor vehicle which is provided with a folding top in such a way that the belt can be used without restriction regardless of whether the top is open or closed, provision is made for a supporting frame to be arranged between the adjacent seats of the rear seat structure, on which frame there are mounted the deflection elements which are provided at the height of the shoulders of the occupants of the rear seats.

A safety-belt arrangement (8) for a seat unit of a motor vehicle with diagonal belts (13)
which are arranged on the outer sides of the seat unit and the belt straps of which are

each guided through a respective upper deflecting member arranged substantially at the
shoulder height of the occupants, wherein the upper deflecting members (14) of the

safety-belt arrangement (8) extending adjacent to a longitudinal median plane of the
vehicle are attached to a support frame (17) provided between the two seats (2, 3) of the

seat unit arranged adjacent to each other as viewed in the transverse direction of the
vehicle, 
characterized in that
 the support frame (17) projecting upwards above the seats
(2, 3) of a rear seat unit (1) comprises a tubular hoop (18) constructed substantially in a

U-shape and extending in the transverse direction of the vehicle and a supporting pillar
(29) connected to the said tubular hoop (18) and situated in front thereof and extending

substantially in a longitudinal median plane
