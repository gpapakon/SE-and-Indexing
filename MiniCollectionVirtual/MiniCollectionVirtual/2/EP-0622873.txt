<ABSTRACT>
A ram drive mechanism for an automated terminal 
crimping machine of the type having a rotating crank shaft 

with an offset crank pin (2) protruding therefrom and 
orbiting about the rotation axis of the crank shaft. The 

mechanism includes a ram (20) mounted for reciprocating 
motion in a first direction toward a crimping zone and in 

a second direction away from a crimping zone. The ram 
(20) carries tooling for performing a terminal crimping 

operation. The mechanism also includes a ram drive 
linkage comprising a drive link (40) having a pivotal 

connection with the crank pin (2) at one end. Another end 
of the drive link (40) has a pivotal connection with a 

link pin (50). The drive linkage reciprocates the ram 
(20) in accordance with orbiting of the crank pin (2). 

The ram (20) is arranged such that the one end of the 
drive link (40) is disposed relatively further in the first 

direction than the other end of the drive link (40), whereby 
the drive link (40) is in tension during the reciprocation of 

the ram (20) toward the crimping zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for 
crimping electrical terminals to conductors and, in 
particular, to a ram drive linkage for an automated 
terminal crimping machine and an adjustable pin for the 
ram drive linkage thereby allowing selection of the proper 
crimp height. Automatic crimping presses have long been used in the 
connector industry to effect high-speed mass termination 
of various cables. Figs. 1 and 2 are side and front 
views, respectively, of one exemplary automatic crimping 
"T-terminating unit" Model No. 768793 which is 
commercially available from AMP, Incorporated. In 
general, such presses include a reciprocating ram group 1 
which is driven by an electric motor 3 through a torque 
multiplication mechanism 5. Various crimping tool-heads 
may be secured to the underside of ram group 1, and the 
attached tool head is driven with the ram group into 
proximity with a continuous-feed applicator 8, which 
tenders the terminals to be crimped. Significant torque multiplication is necessary to 
generate a sufficient downward force for the crimping 
operation, and this is accomplished in the illustrated 
machine by a pulley-driven torque multiplication mechanism 
5. More specifically, the electric motor 3 is housed on a 
lower shelf of the illustrated press. The motor 3 drives 
a pulley 4 which is housed in the rear of the press. The 
pulley 4 drives a belt 7 which extends upwardly and 
encircles a large flywheel 9, which in turn drives a 
cylindrical crank shaft through a clutch enclosed in 
flywheel 9. The crank shaft is rotatably seated in the 
upper section of the press and runs to the front of the 
press. An offset crank pin 2 protrudes forwardly from an 
end face of the crank shaft. The crank pin 2 is offset  
 
from the rotation axis of the crank shaft and orbits about 
the axis as the crank shaft is rotated. The conventional automatic crimping presses are of a 
push link design wherein the crank pin 2 is directly 
coupled to a push link 6, which is in turn coupled to a 
ram 20 through a ball joint and socket 11. The crank pin 
2 compresses the push link 6 and ram 20 downwardly during 
180° of its orbit to advance the entire ram group 1 and 
crimping tool head toward the applicator 8. This 
illustrated press and its commercial counterparts do not 
allow convenient adjustment of the crimp height to 
compensate for such things as tooling wear, dimensional 
tolerances of replacement parts, and dimensional changes 
due to temperature variations. Furthermore, the current
