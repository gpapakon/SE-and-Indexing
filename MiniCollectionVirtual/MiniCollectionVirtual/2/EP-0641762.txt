<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for 
the preparation of 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester derivatives and 
further optically active substances thereof, which are 
useful as intermediates for preparing blood cholesterol 
reducing agents [e.g., hydroxymethylglutaryl-Co-A (HMG-CoA) 
reductase inhibitor]. It is known that 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester derivatives are 
useful as intermediates for preparing blood cholesterol 
reducing agent [hydroxymethylglutaryl-Co-A (HMG-CoA) reductase 
inhibitor such as trans-6-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-2H-pyran-2-one]. For example, a process for preparing the above blood 
cholesterol reducing agent using as the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative (E)-7-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-hydroxy-3-oxo-6-heptenoic 
acid methyl ester is described in Journal 
of Medicinal Chemistry [J. Med. Chem., 1985, Vol..28, No. 
3, pp. 352]. As a process for preparing the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative, Chemistry Letters [Chem. Lett., pp. 161, 1975] 
discloses the following process: Aldehydes are reacted with 
diketene in the presence of TiCl4 at -78°C, which then 
reacted with alcohols, to prepare the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative. Further, Chemistry Express [Chem. Express,  
 
Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 193-195, 1991] discloses the process 
that an aldehyde is reacted with diketene in the presence 
of samarium triiodide at -45°C, which is then reacted with 
an alcohol at -10°C, to prepare the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative. Thus, these processes are required to perform the 
reaction at extremely low temperatures (-78°C or -45°C), 
and therefore the processes have disadvantages as industrially 
applicable processes. Further, these processes are 
employed for preparing a racemic mixture of the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative, while a process for preparing 
directly an optically active substance of the 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivative from aldehyde and diketene has been 
unknown so far. An object of the invention is to provide a novel process 
which is industrially useful for the preparation of 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester 
derivatives. Another object of the invention is to provide a novel 
process which is industrially useful for the preparation of 
optically active 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester derivatives. The invention resides in a process for the preparation 
of a 5-hydroxy-3-ketoester derivative of the formula (IV): 
 
in which R1 represents an alkyl group, an alkyl group having 
a substituent group, an alkenyl group, an alkenyl group 
having a substituent group, an alkynyl
