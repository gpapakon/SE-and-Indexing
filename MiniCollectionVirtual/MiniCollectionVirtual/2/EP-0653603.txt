Device for simultaneously ejecting two fluids 
(1, 2), in particular pyrotechnic fluids, intended to 

react upon mutual contact after their ejection, said 
device comprising: 


first and second sealed reservoirs (21, 121) for 
the first and second of said fluids (2, 1), respectively, 

the first and second reservoirs (21, 121) being mutually 
isolated to prevent contact between the first and second 

fluids (2, 1), 
first and second ejector nozzles (118; 124) for 
the first and second fluids (2, 1), respectively, 
first and second sealed conduits (20, 114; 112) 
respectively connecting the first nozzle (118) to the 

first reservoir (21) and the second nozzle (124) to the 
second reservoir (121) and mutually isolated to prevent 

contact between the two fluids (1, 2), 
means (7, 49) operable to expel the first and 
second fluids (2, 1) simultaneously from the first and 

second reservoirs (21, 121) to the first and second 
nozzles (118, 126) via the first and second conduits 

(20, 114; 122), 
 
   characterised in that the first and second 

reservoirs (21, 121) comprise first and second coaxial 
cylinders (27, 129) closed downstream with reference to a 

common axial direction (9) by a respective end wall 
(25, 107) into which the first conduit (20, 114) or the 

second conduit (122) respectively opens, and in that the 
means (7, 49) operable to expel simultaneously the first 

and second fluids (2, 1) include first and second pistons 
(7, 49) adapted to slide axially in at least said 

direccion (9) inside the first and second cylinders 
(27, 129), respectively, and closing the first and second 

cylinders (27, 129), respectively, upstream with 
reference to said direction (9), the second piston (49)  

 
being mechanically coupled to the first piston (7) so 

that sliding of the first piston (7) in said direction 
(9) inside the first cylinder (27) causes sliding of the 

second piston (49) in said direction inside the second 
cylinder (129), and means (82) operable to cause sliding 

of the first piston (7) in said direction (9) inside the 
first cylinder (27). 
Device according to claim 1 characterised in 
that it comprises at least two sealed subassemblies 

(3, 4) stored separately and adapted to be assembled 
together for use, namely a first subassembly (4) 

comprising the first cylinder (27) containing the first 
fluid (2), the corresponding end wall (25) and the first 

piston (7), and a second subassembly (3) comprising the 
second cylinder (129) containing the second fluid (1), 

the respective end wall (127) and the second piston (49). 
Device according to claim 2 characterised in 
that it comprises a third subassembly (5) separate from 

the first and second subassemblies (3, 4) in storage and 
assembled to the first and second subassemblies (3, 4) 

for use, the third subassembly (5) including the means 
(82) operable to cause sliding of the first piston (7). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the means (82) operable to cause 

sliding of the first piston (7) include a pyrotechnic 
generator (82) operable to produce pressurised gas acting 

on the first piston (7) in the first cylinder (27) in 
opposition to the first fluid (2). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the means (82) operable to cause 

sliding of the first piston (7), the first cylinder (27) 
and the second cylinder (129) are axially aligned in said 

direction (9). 
Device according to claim 5 characterised in 
that the first piston (7) includes an axial rod (48)  

 
adapted to push the second piston (49) in said direction 

(9), said rod (48) projecting axially in said direction 
(9) relative to the first piston (7) through the first 

cylinder (27) and the respective end wall (25) in order 
to engage with the second piston (49). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that it comprises, at the opening 

(31, 125) of each of the first conduit (20, 114) and 
second conduit (122) into the respective end wall 

(25, 107), a normally closed valve (29, 126) opening 
towards the first conduit (20, 114) or the second conduit 

(122), respectively, when the pressure in the first or 
second cylinder (27, 129), respectively, exceeds a 

predetermined threshold. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
for use as an infra-red flare characterised in that the 

first and second fluids (2, 1) comprise an oxidising 
fluid (2) and a pyrophoric fluid (1).
