<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polyketone yarns of which the maximum tangential modulus at an elongation of more than 0,2 % is at least 10 N/tex which display both high strength and, if so desired, a high elongation at break. The quality number, which is measured on a single filament out of a bundle of at least about 30 filaments spun simultaneously through one spinneret and given as 

g(s,e), is higher than 85, preferably higher than 100. The quality number of a yarn spun through one spinneret of one or more holes is higher thant 110, preferrably higher than 120. The yarns are manufactured by extruding a solution of a linear polymer of alternating ethylene and carbon monoxide units in a resorcinol-containing solvent, after which the solvent is removed with the aid of methanol as coagulant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a yarn of a linear polymer of alternating 
ethylene and carbon monoxide units of which the maximum tangential 
modulus at an elongation of more than 0,2% is at least 10 N/tex, and a 
process for making such yarns. Single filament yarns of this type are disclosed in International 
Patent Application W0 90/14453. The maximum modulus of the polyketone 
yarns described in said document generally is satisfactory. Also, some 
yarns of satisfactory tenacity are described. However, the elongation 
at break of yarns which possess such satisfactory tenacity is low, as 
a result of which the yarns are not always suitable for application in 
industry. The yarns described in this application which do have 
sufficient elongation at break are substantially less strong, so that, 
generally speaking, it can be argued that the overall quality of the 
yarns according to this document is found insufficient for every 
practical application. 
Yarns of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph are also 
disclosed in EP-A-456 306. In this document, a yarn of good overall 
quality is described. However, the yarn is obtained by spinning 
through 6 capillaries, which means that the yarn is comprised of 6 
filaments spun simultaneously. Such a slender yarn is not suitable for 
industrial practice. In the present document, with a yarn both single filament yarns and 
multifilament yarns are meant. 
Polyketone yarns have now been found which exhibit very favourable 
properties in both of these respects, i.e., yarns of good tenacity 
also have the desired comparatively high elongation at break. The 
yarns of the very favourable quality now found can be prepared in a 
highly economical manner, viz. by spinning more than 30 filaments  
 
simultaneously through one spinneret. It is well-known that by 
spinning a yarn through a capillary comprising more than a few 
spinning holes, say 30 holes ore more, the physical properties of the 
yarn will be considerably less than the yarn obtained by spinning 
through one or just a few spinning holes, especially when spinning at 
practical conditions. The invention now consists in that the quality number according to the 
formula σ-ε of the yarn of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph 
is higher than 38 mN/tex and the yarn comprises at least 30 filaments 
which are spun simultaneously through one spinneret. In the formula 
σ.ε, σ stands for the tenacity of the yarn measured on a single 
filament and is expressed in mN/tex, while ε stands for the elongation 
at
