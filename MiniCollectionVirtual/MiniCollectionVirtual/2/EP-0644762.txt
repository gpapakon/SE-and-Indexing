<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new medical use of 
the pyrazolopyridine compound or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof. Some pyrazolopyridine compounds are known to be 
useful as psychostimulant, antihypertensive agent, remedy 
for renal insufficiency, diuretic, and the like (e.g. 
EP-0299209, EP-0379979, etc), but up to now it is not 
known that the pyrazolopyridine compound is useful for the 
prevention and/or the treatment of anemia by improvement of 
the erythropoietin production. 
The Merck Manual. 15 th. edition, 1987, Merck Sharp & Dohme 
Research Laboratories, p. 1105-1106, discloses that renal 
lesions result in anemia.  
 The present invention relates to a new use of the 
pyrazolopyridine compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof. More particularly, it relates to the use of the 
pyrazolopyridine compound for the 
preparation of a medicament for the 
prevention and/or the 
treatment of anemia in a human being or an animal by improvement 
of the erythropoietin production  
 The object of the present invention is to provide 
a use of the pyrazolopyridine compound or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof for the 
manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or the 
treatment of anemia in a human being or an animal by 
improvement of the erythropoietin production. The inventors have found the pyrazolopyridine 
compound of the present invention has increased the 
production of erythropoietin. The pyrazolopyridine compound to be used in the 
present invention is shown by the following formula (I) : 
 
wherein 
R1is lower alkyl, aryl which may have one or more 
suitable substituent(s) or a heterocyclic 
group, R2is a group of the formula : 
 
   (wherein R4is protected amino or hydroxy 
and  
 R5is hydrogen or lower alkyl); 
cyano; 
a group of the formula : 
-A-R6 
   (wherein R6is an acyl group, or a group 
of the formula : 
-CORN 
   wherein RNis N-containing heterocyclic 
group which may have one or 
more suitable substituent(s) 
selected from the group 
consisting of lower alkyl, 
lower alkoxy(lower)alkyl, 
acyloxy(lower)alkyl, carboxy, 
protected carboxy and 
acyl(lower)alkyl, and Ais lower aliphatic hydrocarbon 
group which may have one or more 
suitable substitutent(s)); 
amidated carboxy; 
unsaturated heterocyclic group which may 
have one or more suitable substituent(s); 
amino or protected amino; and R3is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or 
halogen,  
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Some of the compound (I) are known compounds and
