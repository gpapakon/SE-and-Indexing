<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous wax and polydiorganosiloxane dispersions (P) containing dispersant, containing, as wax,   (A) at least one oxidised hydrocarbon wax having a needle penetration (ASTM D-1321) of 
<
/= 4 dmm, and optionally (B) at least one unoxidised hydrocarbon wax, and, as polydiorganosiloxane, (C) at least one optionally amino-modified and/or nonionogenically modified polydiorganosiloxane having a nitrogen content of 
<
 0.6% by weight, are suitable as highly permanent plasticisers and sewability improvers in particular for white goods.
