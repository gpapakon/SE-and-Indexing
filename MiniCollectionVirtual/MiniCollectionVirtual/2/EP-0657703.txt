<ABSTRACT>
A shaft (60) extends across an air discharge opening (15) and is 
rotatably mounted therein. A drive means (55) is operatively connected 

to the shaft for rotating the shaft on its axis. A plurality of planar 
discs, (70), are eccentrically mounted on the shaft. A pair of 

adjacent louver blades (35, 40) extending across the air discharge 
opening are pivotally mounted at their one edge in the air discharge 

opening. A spring (80) is connected to the louver blades for biasing 
them into an engaging relationship with the discs such that, as the 

discs rotate, the louver blades are caused to rotate on their axes to 
cause a change in the direction of airflow emanating from the discharge 

opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air sweep mechanism disposed 
in an air discharge opening of an air conditioning system 
to sweep the discharged air across both the horizontal and 
vertical planes. Air conditioning systems are typically provided with 
discharge openings from which conditioned air may be 
distributed to a desired area. The discharge openings are 
commonly supplied with a mechanism which includes louvers 
for controlling the direction of the airflow emanating 
therefrom. The louvers may be used to improve the air 
distribution performance of these systems. For example, 
to provide improved air distribution performance it has 
become common practice to employ sweeping mechanisms which 
include a driving device for moving the louvers back and 
forth to sweep the conditioned air from top to bottom or 
side to side. It should be noted, however, that these 
mechanisms typically include a complex linkage between the 
louvers and the driving device. The louvers are also used to control the "throw" of the 
conditioned air. Controlling the throw of the conditioned 
air refers to the ability to control the depth 
distribution of the conditioned air. An increase in the 
throw corresponds to an increase in the depth of the air 
distribution into the desired area. To provide an 
increase in the conditioned air's throw, some sweeping 
mechanisms periodically adjust the louvers to a non-parallel 
position to pinch the air that flows between the 
louvers. This periodic pinching increases the air speed, 
thereby increasing the throw of the airflow. Such an 
apparatus is shown and described in U.S. Patent No. 
5299978. issued on 5 April 1994 to the assignee of the 
present invention. While this apparatus provides 
up-and-down air distribution and periodic thrusting of the  
 
air, there are certain features of the design which are undesirable. 
For example, it does not provide side-to-side sweeping of the 
conditioned air, and the linkage mechanism between the louvers and the 
driving device is relatively complex. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved 
air sweep mechanism for an air conditioning system. Viewed from one aspect the invention provides an air sweep 
mechanism of the type disposed in an air discharge opening of an air 
conditioner system for automatically directing and sweeping the airflow 
emanating therefrom, the air sweep mechanism comprising:
 
   a shaft extending across the air discharge opening and rotatably 
mounted therein;
 
   drive means operatively connected
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An air sweep mechanism of the type disposed in an air discharge 
opening (15) of an air conditioner system (10) for automatically 

directing and sweeping the airflow emanating therefrom, the air sweep 
mechanism comprising: 

   a shaft (60) extending across the air discharge opening and 
rotatably mounted therein; 

   drive means (55) operatively connected to said shaft for rotating 
said shaft on its axis; 

   a plurality of discs (70) disposed in spaced relationship on said 
shaft such that for each disc, the distance between at least one point 

on its periphery and the axis of said shaft is larger than the distance 
between another point on its periphery and the axis of said shaft; 

   a pair of adjacent louver blades (35, 40) extending across the 
air discharge opening, each louver blade having first and second edges 

(45, 50) and being pivotally mounted in the air discharge opening about 
its first edge (45); and 

   biasing means (80) for biasing said louver blade second edges 
(50) toward each other to thereby cause an engaging relationship 

between said discs and said pair of louver blades such that as said 
discs rotate, the louver blades are caused to pivot about their first 

edges thus causing a change in the direction of airflow emanating from 
the discharge opening. 
An air sweep mechanism as claimed in claim 1 wherein said biasing 
means comprises a tension spring (80) connected between said louver 

blades. 
An air sweep mechanism as claimed in any one of claims 1 and 2 
wherein said pair of louver blades are disposed on opposite sides of 

the shaft. 
An air sweep mechanism as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 
3 wherein said plurality of discs are elliptical in shape. 
An air sweep mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
 

said plurality of discs are substantially planar and are mounted on 
said shaft such that each disc has its plane angled with respect to a 

plane normal to the axis (75) of said shaft. 
An air sweep mechanism as claimed in claim 5 wherein each disc is 
so mounted as to have its place at an angle of substantially forty-five 

degrees with respect to the plane normal to the axis of said shaft. 
An air sweep mechanism of the type disposed in an air discharge 
opening of an air conditioner system for automatically directing and 

sweeping the airflow emanating therefrom, the air sweep mechanism 
comprising: 

   a shaft disposed across the air discharge opening and rotatably 
mounted therein; 

   a plurality of elliptically shaped discs mounted in axially 
spaced relationship on said shaft; 

   a pair of adjacent louver blades disposed on opposite sides of 
said shaft, with each having first and second edges and being pivotally 

mounted at its first edge; 
   biasing means connected to said louver blades for biasing said 

louver blade second edges toward each other thereby causing said pair 
of louver blades to engage said plurality of discs; and 

   drive means operatively connected to said shaft for rotating said 
shaft and said discs about the axis of said shaft thereby causing said 

louver blades to pivot about their first edges which in turn causes 
sweeping of the conditioned air through a plane normal to the axis of 

the shaft as it passes between said pair of louver blades. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein said drive means 
comprises a motor. 
An air sweep mechanism comprising: 
   a pair of louver blades extending across an air discharge opening 

and pivotally mounted about a louver axis substantially parallel to 
said louver blades; 

   at least one disc disposed between said pair of louver blades and 
rotatable about a disc axis substantially parallel to said louver 

 
blades; 

   biasing means for biasing said louver blades to pivot such that 
each louver blade contacts a peripheral edge of said disc; and 

   drive means for driving rotation of said disc; 
   wherein the distance between said peripheral edge and said disc 

axis varies around said disc such that, in use, rotation of said disc 
drives pivoting of said pair of louver blades to cause a redirection of
