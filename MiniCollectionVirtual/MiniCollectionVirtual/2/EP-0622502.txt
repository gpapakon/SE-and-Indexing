<ABSTRACT>
False floors are known whose load-bearing substructure exhibits foot supports for the floor panels and grid-arrangement load-bearing bars fastened on said foot supports. The floor panels (15) comprise a metallic tub (13) with a filling (16) consisting of, for example, anhydrite. The tubs (13) are delimited at the top by an encircling, outwardly projecting flange (14). When these floor panels (15) are laid, cavities (18) are present laterally between the same. In the event of high loading, in particular point loading at the border regions of such floor panels (15), the flanges (14) may deform. In order to avoid this and to improve the load-bearing capacity of the false floor overall, grid-arrangement load-bearing bars (19) or parts of such are arranged in the cavities (18) between the floor panels (15) such that they support the flanges (14) of the tubs (13) of the floor panels (15), with the result that loads can be transferred onto the foot supports (10) via said grid-arrangement load-bearing bars (19).
