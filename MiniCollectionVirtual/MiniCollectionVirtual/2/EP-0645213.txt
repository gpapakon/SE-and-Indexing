<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a device for the firm positioning of a pallet on a clamping table, consisting of a vertically movable pallet carrier (3) for transporting and for lifting and putting down a pallet (1) provided with clamping elements (5) on the underside, and of at least one clamping means which is arranged in the clamping table (7), can be actuated by vertical movements of the pallet carrier (3), and has at least one wedge slide (12, 13) for locking a clamping element (5) of the deposited pallet (1) as well as at least one actuator (18), which can be operated by the pallet carrier (3), for releasing the locking action against spring force (21, 23), the actuator (10) being directly fastened to one of the wedge slides (12, 13).

A device for the fixed positioning of a pallet on a clamping 
table, comprising 


a vertically movable pallet carrier (3) for transporting 
and lifting or placing on a pallet (1) provided with 

tensioning elements (5) on the underside, and 
at least one tensioning device which is arranged in the 
clamping table (7), may be actuated by vertical movements 

of the pallet carrier (3) and has at least one tapered 
slide valve (12, 13) for clamping a tensioning element (5) 

of the deposited pallet (1), and at least one adjusting 
element (18), which may be actuated by the pallet carrier 

(3), for releasing the clamping action in opposition to a 
spring force (21, 23), 
 
characterized 


in that the adjusting element (10) is secured directly to 
one of the tapered slide valves (12, 13), and 
in that, to clamp a plurality of tensioning elements (5) at 
the same time, the tapered slide valve (12) carrying the 

adjusting element is connected to at least a second tapered 
slide valve (13) by way of a push rod (20) and at least one 

spring (21). 
A device according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the push rod (20) is guided to be displaceable in one of the 

tapered slide valves (12) and is connected with force fit to this 
tapered slide valve (12) by way of the one spring (21). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that there is secured to the push rod (20) one 

end of a second spring (23) which is supported by its other end 
against a fixed stop.
