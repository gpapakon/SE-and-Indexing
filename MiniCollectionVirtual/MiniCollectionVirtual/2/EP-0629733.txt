<ABSTRACT>
A machine particularly for household use for washing and 
rinsing laundry, comprising a washing tank, a programmer, the 

electric circuits connecting the programmer to the various 
functional elements of the machine, and at least one rinsing 

cycle including a phase for loading rinsing liquid into the 
tank, a drum rotation phase and a phase for draining the rinsing 

liquid, the drum rotation phase being composed of a 
first period in which the drum rotates at low speed, a second 

period in which the drum is brought to a rotating speed similar 
to the centrifuging speed, and a third period in which 

the drum is slowed down to a low rotating speed. The second 
period in which the rotating speed is similar to the centrifuge 

speed lasts between 2 and 30 seconds, or is such as to 
impart, in accordance with the cylindrical perimeter, a centrifugal 

acceleration of at least 10 g for at least 3 seconds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for washing 
and rinsing fabrics, in particular to a household machine for 
washing and rinsing fabrics, according to the preamble of 
claim 1. In the following there will be specific reference to 
household washing machines, but it is understood that the 
present invention is entirely applicable to machines for 
washing and drying fabrics as well. Washing machines, particularly household washing machines, 
are known that utilize electromechanical means called 
programmers for making the functional elements of the machine 
perform all the required functions, with the times and in the 
sequence desired. The current drive on the market to reduce all kinds of 
consumption, from energy to raw materials to the water for 
household use, together with the constant endeavor to orient 
service increasingly toward the consumer's needs, has stimulated 
the development and production of increasingly efficient 
washing machines with reduced consumption of energy, 
detergent and/or water. So-called recirculating washing machines have therefore 
been particularly developed in recent years, which all offer 
very reduced water consumption. Since the greatest water consumption occurs during the 
conventional rinsing phases, the effort to reduce water consumption 
has unfortunately been concentrated on reducing water 
consumption during these rinsing cycles, the inevitable  
 
consequence being a progressive lowering of the water level 
in the tank to the point that it merely touches the lower 
edge of the drum so that the laundry contained there is not 
sufficiently soaked; this is all the more so when there is a 
full laundry load in the drum. The logical consequence has been an inevitable impairment 
of rinsing results, whether in conventional machines or 
in ones functioning with recirculation of washing liquid. Technical solutions have naturally been developed for 
eliminating the disadvantage of unsatisfactory rinsing. For 
example, DE 4 115 776 C2 illustrates a rinsing process consisting 
in a succession of centrifuge impulses alternating with 
water loading phases. Nevertheless the proposed solution is not fully satisfactory 
because of the considerable frequency with which water 
is drawn into the tank and the resulting elevated use of 
the pressure switch. The document US-A-3,388,410 discloses a cleaning apparatus and a method for 
cleaning clothes wherein the drum is rotated at two different speeds during the 
cleaning cycle. In addition, the rotary chamber speed is

<CLAIMS>
A machine for washing and rinsing laundy, comprising a washing tank, a 
drum inside the tank for receiving the fabrics to be washed and rinsed, a 

programmer, the electric circuits connecting the programmer to the various 
functional elements of the machine, a circuit for recirculating the liquid 

contained in the tank, a recirculating pump inserted in the circuit, a 
discharge nozzle of the circuit disposed with an orientation so as to cast the 

liquid jet into the central inside area of the drum, and at least one rinsing 
cycle that includes a phase (A) for loading rinsing liquid into the tank, a 

drum rotation phase and a phase for draining the rinsing liquid, 

characterized in that
 the drum rotation phase is composed of a first 
period (B1) in which the drum rotates at low speed, a second period (B2) in 

which the drum is brought to a rotating speed similar to the centrifuging 
speed with a short impuls of high rotating speed, and a third period (B3) in 

which the drum is slowed down to a low rotating speed and during the 
phase for loading rinsing water the drum is rotated at a speed sufficiently 

high to distribute at least part of the laundry along the inside cylindrical 
perimeter of the drum and the recirculating pump is kept in operation 

during the drum rotation phase during the rinsing cycle. 
The washing machine according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the 
second period, in which the rotating speed is similar to the centrifuge 

speed, lasts between 3 and 30 seconds, and
 
in the second period the rotating speed is such as to impart, in accordance 

with the cylindrical perimeter of the drum, a centrifugal acceleration of at 
least 10 g for at least 3 seconds. 
The washing machine according to any of the previous claims, 

characterized in that
 the rotating speed of the third period (B3) is  
 

sufficiently high to distribute the laundry along the inside circular 
perimeter of the drum.
