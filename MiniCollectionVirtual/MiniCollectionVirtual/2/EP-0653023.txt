<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lockable telescopic device (1) which includes a cylindrical tube (10) and a piston rod (3). The piston rod (3) includes an expandable locking device (60) which, when active, forcibly abuts a part of the inner wall of the tube (10). The expandable locking device (60) includes two sleeves (61, 62) which accompany movement of the piston rod (3) in the longitudinal direction of the device (1). The piston rod (3) and the tube (10) are locked against relative movement by rotating the sleeves (61, 62) relative to one another with the aid of a lever (51) mounted on the piston rod. The invention also relates to the use of the lockable telescopic device in conjunction with so-called engine shelves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lockable telescopic
device according to the preamble of Claim 1 and to the
use of the lockable telescopic device. Such a telescopic
device is known from US-A-3,095,825.There are many situations in which there is a need for
a simple and reliable telescopic device which will
enable objects and apparatus of different kinds to be
adjusted to different positions and firmly locked
therein, in particular in case of strong forces acting on
the telescopic device.The object of the present invention is to provide an
attractive device of the aforesaid kind. This object
is achieved with a lockable, telescopic device that
has the features set forth in Claim 1.
The dependent claims define advantageous embodiments of
the invention.One advantage afforded by the invention, among other
advantages, is that the device can be readily adjusted
to different lengths and locked in its adjusted position,
and can be used in extremely difficult environments.The invention will now be described in more detail
with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof
and also with reference to the accompanying drawings,
in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal view of the inventive
device; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view in
larger scale taken on the line II-II in Figure 1;
Figure 3 is a longitudinal sectioned view of the
device; and Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view in
larger scale taken on the line IV-IV in Figure 3.The illustrated inventive telescopic device 1 comprises
a cylinder 2 and a piston rod 3.The cylinder 2 is constructed around a cylindrical
tube 10 which is sealed at its rearward end by an
attachment in the form of a sleeve 11 welded to said 
end. Also mounted on the rearward end of the cylinder 2
is a nipple 12 for connection to a hydraulic system,
when used. As will be seen from Figure 2, the tube 10
is provided internally with a keyway 13 which extends
along at least a major part of the length of the
cylinder 2.Fitted to the forward end of the cylinder 2 is a so-called
cylinder cover 14 which is screwed to the tube
10 by means of a screw joint 15. The cylinder cover 14
includes a central opening and carries three ring
seals in the form of a stripper or wiper 16, a U-cuff
17 and an O-ring 18. A stop shoulder 19 is mounted on
the outside of the tube 10.The piston rod 3 comprises a circular rod 30 having a
centre part 31 whose diameter is adapted to the internal
diameter of the tube 10 and the cover 14. The
rearward end of the rod 30 is provided with a shoulder
32 whose diameter is smaller
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lockable telescopic device comprising a cylindrical tube (10) and a piston rod (3),
wherein said piston rod (3) includes an expandable locking device (60) which, in its active

position, is in pressure abutment with a part of the inner wall of said tube (10); and
wherein said expandable locking device (60) includes an eccentric sleeve (61) which is

non-rotatable in relation to said piston rod (3) or which is integral with said piston rod (3),
and an outer sleeve (62) which is slidable and non-rotatable in relation to said tube (10),

characterized in that

said telescopic device further comprises
a

keyway (13) provided on the inner surface of said tube (10) and extending axially along
the length of said tube (10) and an external key (72) of said outer sleeve (62) which

engages with said keyway (13) of said tube (10). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the outer sleeve (62) is provided
with at least one slot (73) so as to enable the

sleeve to expand.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the eccentric sleeve (61) and
the outer sleeve (62) are fixed axially to the piston

rod (3) such as to accompany movement of said piston
rod.
A device according to any one of Claims 1-3,

characterized
 in that the peripheral
surface of the eccentric sleeve (61) includes two

eccentric parts (64, 65) which are terminated by
transition edges (66, 67).
A device according to any one of Claims 1-4,

characterized
 in that the outer sleeve
(62) has a centre hole which includes two eccentric

parts (68, 69) which are terminated by transition
edges (70, 71); and in that the outer sleeve (62) has

a circular peripheral surface. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-5,

characterized
 in that the piston rod (3)
is provided with an operating device (51) which enables

the piston rod (3) to be rotated relative to the
tube (10).
A device according to any one of Claims 1-6,

characterized
 in that the tube (10) has a
working fluid connection point (12).
A device according to any one of Claims 1-7,

characterized
 in that the tube (10) and
the piston rod (3) are provided with attachment means

(11 and 38 respectively) for connecting the device to
an object.

to any one of Claims 1-8, 
characterized

in that the device is used to adjust the angular
position of a so-called engine shelf in conjunction

with adjusting belt tension and like tasks.
