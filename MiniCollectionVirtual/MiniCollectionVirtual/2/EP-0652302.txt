<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for vacuum web coating, an evaporation 
means has a plurality of separately spaced outlet 

nozzles(29) through which vapour is conveyed to a 
deposition zone(30) at the surface of a chilled rotatable 

drum(20,31) in a vacuum chamber(12) over which drum the 
substrate web is advanced by a web transport system. 
The outlet nozzle arrangement advantageously comprises 
a plurality of linear slots disposed transversely to the 

web substrate path to deliver vapour at positions disposed 
sequentially in the direction of the web substrate advance, 

the nozzle outlets being disposed on an arcuate surface 
around, but spaced 
from, the curved surface of the 
rotatable drum (20). 
By varying the nozzle profile, for example the width 
and/or spacing of the nozzle outlets the application of the 

coating may be tightly controlled to obtain improved 
uniformity of the coating, material collection efficiency 

and control of the substrate heat loading. The apparatus 
is particularly suitable for applying thick coatings of 

material such as metal on paper or plastic films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for vacuum web coating and to a process of 
web coating by vapour deposition of a coating of a material on a web substrate in vacuum. In vapour deposition processes coating material is vaporised in a heated crucible 
and the vapour is condensed on a surface ofthe web to be coated, the web generally being 
a large continuous web which is continuously moved through a vapour deposition zone 
by winding gear. The deposition zone is usually provided by a chilled metal surface and 
generally is a rotating cold drum over which the web is advanced. In order to avoid 
contaminants the coating process is carried out in a vacuum chamber at high vacuum 
wherein the pressure is generally in the range 1.33 - 1.33 x 10-2 pascals (10-2 - 10-4 Torr) 
and the process is accordingly termed vacuum web coating. The crucible is generally 
contained in an evaporation retort having an elongated outlet nozzle profiled as a slit 
disposed across the web path, through which nozzle the vaporised material is transferred 
to the web surface where it condenses as a thin film coating. Using appropriate transport 
systems one or both sides of a web may be coated with one or more coats of material. 
The thickness and uniformity of the film can be accurately maintained by controlling the 
rate of evaporation ofthe coating material and the time of exposure of the web substrate 
to the vapour emerging from the nozzle, the exposure time being generally controlled by 
controlling the travel speed of the web relative to the nozzle. Web coating by vapour 
deposition has been described in the book "Web Processing and Converting Technology 
(Van Nostrand Reinhold Company - 1984) - Chapter 11 entitled "High - vacuum roll 
coating" by Ernst K Hartwig". In US-A-3081 201 a method of forming an electric 
capacitor is described which comprises vapour depositing a dielectric layer on a flexible 
substrate as the substrate is continuously rolled upon a mandrel by vaporising dielectric 
material from an evaporator provided with a single nozzle and then vapour-depositing a 
conducting layer over the dielectric layer by vaporising conducting material in a second 
evaporator also provided with a single nozzle. Using these processes, well defined film 
coatings of metals, alloys or other materials having thicknesses typically of less than 
0.1 µm (micron) can be applied to substrates such as paper or plastics as thin as  
 
1.0 µm (micron). We have found, however, that for thicker coatings such as the 5-25 µm 
(micron)
