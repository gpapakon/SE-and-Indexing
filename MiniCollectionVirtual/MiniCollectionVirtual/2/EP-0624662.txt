<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the plating of aluminum 
and aluminum alloys, and, more particularly, to the 
plating of 390 aluminum alloys with iron. The automotive industry is investigating the use of 
aluminum engines with aluminum pistons to reduce the weight 
of the vehicle and to meet fuel economy requirements. However, 
it is essential that either the piston or the cylinder 
bore be coated with a metal harder than aluminum to 
prevent piston skirt scuffing during cold starts. Therefore, 
an inexpensive, environmentally sound method of plating 
the piston with iron would be valuable. Presently, an iron coating is plated onto the surface 
of the aluminum pistons, generally employing a copper undercoat. 
In one process, copper cyanide and iron chloride 
baths are used in the plating. Copper cyanide is a highly 
toxic and tightly regulated material. The iron chloride 
bath is also a highly toxic and extremely corrosive bath 
that is very destructive to the equipment around it. An alternative approach is to insert an iron sleeve 
into the cylinder bore. Still another approach is to coat 
the inside of the bore with a suitable metal alloy by thermal 
spray coating processes and then re-machining the bore. 
These approaches are estimated to be 8 to 14 times as expensive 
as piston plating.  The previous methods employ many steps. Examples of 
the previous art for plating on aluminum may be found in 
Metal Finishing Guidebook and Directory Issue '92, pages 
157-158, and Electroplating Engineering Handbook, Fourth 
Edition, edited by Larry Durney, pages 185-188. In a recent patent application (application Serial No. 
07/959,881, filed October 13, 1992) filed in the name of 
the present inventor and assigned to the same assignee as 
the present application, a process of plating iron onto 
aluminum is disclosed and claimed, using a zincate process. 
However, while the teachings of that invention are certainly 
useful, it requires the added zincate step. Further, 
one cannot plate iron directly onto the zincate layer without 
an additional adhesion layer such as nickel or copper. 
The reason for this lies in the mechanism of the zincate 
itself. Zincate readily deposits an immersion layer on 
aluminum, but the reduction step to the next metal is limited 
to those metals that will reduce over the zincate 
without dissolving and destroying the very thin zinc coating. 
Also, zincate often requires a postplate bake to enhance 
the adhesion. It is desired to provide a method, preferably inexpensive, 
for
