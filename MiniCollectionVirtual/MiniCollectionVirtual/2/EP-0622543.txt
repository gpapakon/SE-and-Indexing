Hydraulic adjusting device for fluid-flow 
machines having a variable-pitch propeller, transmission 

elements for conducting a hydraulic fluid being arranged 
in and on a shaft connected to the variable-pitch propeller, 

and the shaft (3) passing completely or partly 
through a space (6) of the fluid-flow machine, which 

space (6) contains a hydraulic fluid, characterized in 
that the space (6) is hermetically sealed off from the 

environment, in that a hydraulic pump (8), control 
elements (10) and transmission elements (5, 14) are 

arranged inside the space (6) in such a way that any 
leakage between hydraulic pump (8), control elements (10) 

and transmission elements (5, 14) constitutes a return 
flow into the space (6). 
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hydraulic pump (8) is arranged next to 

the shaft (3) and can be driven from the shaft (3) by 
mechanical transmission elements (14) during operation of 

the fluid-flow machine. 
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hydraulic pump (8) is arranged next to 

the shaft (3) and can be driven by an electric motor. 
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hydraulic pump (8) is arranged inside 

the shaft (3) or a shaft part and rotates with it. 
Adjusting device according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that a gear (2) arranged between motor or generator 

(1) drives the hydraulic pump (8). 
Adjusting device according to Claim 4, characterized  
 

in that a servomotor (11) arranged on the motor or 
generator (1) and passing through the shafts and/or shaft 

parts with a one-piece or multi-piece transmission 

element (13) drives the hydraulic pump (8). 
Adjusting device according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the hydraulic pump 

(8) has an intermittent mode of operation. 
Adjusting device according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the hydraulic pump (8) has an 

electromechanical and/or electrothermal operating principle. 
Adjusting device according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that mechanical and/or 

electromechanically operable control elements (10) 
control the path of the hydraulic fluid.
