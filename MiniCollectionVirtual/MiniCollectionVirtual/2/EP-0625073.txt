<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
operator interfacing methods for inputting operator-selectable 
control parameters to a centrifuge instrument. A centrifuge instrument is a 
device operable to expose a liquid sample carried within a 
centrifuge rotor to a centrifugal force field. The rotor is 
mounted on the upper end of a drive spindle that projects into 
an enclosed chamber. Typically, a cooling arrangement is 
provided whereby the temperature of the sample may be 
controlled for the centrifuge run. The most common operator-selectable control parameters 
of a centrifuge run are: (1) rotor angular velocity ("speed") and 
its associated parameter (2) relative centrifugal force ("RCF"), 
(3) sample temperature, and (4) duration of the run. The unit 
for relative centrifugal force is ("xG"), where G is force due to 
gravity. For instruments operating in the so-called "ultra-speed" 
regime it is common that the angular velocity needed to 
perform a selected protocol may lie in the range from 
approximately twenty thousand through approximately eighty 
to one hundred thousand revolutions-per-minute (rpm). The 
value of relative centrifugal force to which a sample is exposed 
during a run is dependent both upon the rotor speed and the  
 
distance of the sample from the axis of rotation. Values of this 
parameter in excess of one hundred thousand xG are common. For the large majority of protocols (on the order of 
seventy-five percent) a sample temperature of four degrees (4째 
C) is used. A lesser but still significant number of protocols (on 
the order of an additional fifteen percent) require a sample of 
temperature twenty degrees (20째 C). The remainder of 
protocols may require alternative temperature value between 
0째C and 40째C. The time duration for a centrifuge run is either 
implemented using an "elapsed time" mode or an indefinite 
time ("HOLD") mode. In the former the centrifuge run extends 
for a time period selected by the operator. The run is 
automatically terminated at the end of that period. In the 
latter mode the centrifuge run continues until it is manually 
terminated by the operator. Most operator manipulable control panels for centrifuge 
instruments include a speed parameter function control key, a 
temperature parameter function control key, a time parameter 
function control key, and a time "HOLD" parameter function 
control key. The numeric values for the selected speed 
parameter, temperature parameter and time parameter are 
input to the instrument using a ten-digit (zero through

digit in the first subset shifting all previously 
displayed digits one place to the left and entering 

each subsequent significant digit in the thousands
