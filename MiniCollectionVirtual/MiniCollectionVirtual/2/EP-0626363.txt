<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a cyclic ketone, and more particularly of cyclopentanone and 2,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, from the corresponding dicarboxylic acid, by decarboxylation and cyclisation. The process of preparation of the invention is characterised in that the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase in the presence of an effective amount of a metal or derivative of the elements chosen from: boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, antimony, bismuth, molybdenum, rubidium, caesium or vanadium.
