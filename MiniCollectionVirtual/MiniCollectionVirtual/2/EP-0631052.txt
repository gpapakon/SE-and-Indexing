<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a compressor having a plate rotatable about an 
axis of a rotary shaft and a piston connected to the plate, 

wherein the plate causes the piston to reciprocate between a 
top dead center and a bottom dead center in accordance with 

the rotation movement of the plate. A cam surface is provided 
with the plate for actuating the piston. A shoe engages with 

the plate for transmitting the rotation movement of the plate 
to the piston. A recess is formed on the piston for 

restricting rolling of the shoe on the plate for causing the 
shoe to slide on the plate to reduce a pressure caused by a 

contact between the cam surface and the shoe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wave plate type compressor 
in which pistons reciprocate due to the rotation of a solid 
cam shaped wave plate secured to a rotary shaft. In compressors of the type that use the rotating movement of 
a swash plate to reciprocate pistons in their associated 
cylinder bores, each piston reciprocates only once for each 
complete revolution the swash plate makes. One way to 
increase the compression displacement per rotation of the 
swash plate, is to design larger sized compressors. Since 
compressors however are often mounted in vehicles, their large 
design is distinctly undesirable. One proposed solution to the above shortcoming is the recently 
developed wave plate type compressor disclosed in, Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-110783. This compressor 
design uses a solid cam shaped plate, having a surface that 
contains wave like undulations extending in a peripheral 
direction. The design of this plate thus varies from that of 
the conventional swash plate. The conventional wave plate type compressor will now be 
briefly described with reference to Fig. 15. A pair of cam 
surfaces 51a and 51b having predetermined widths are provided 
at the periphery of the front and rear surfaces of a wave  
 
plate 51. Rollers 53, 54 are rotatably supported between the 
cam surfaces 51a, 51b and a double-headed piston 52. The 
contact made between rollers 53, 54 and their respective cam 
surfaces 51a and 51b is in a widthwise direction across the 
cam surfaces. When the wave plate 51 turns, therefore, the 
rollers 53, 54 roll on the cam surfaces 51a and 51b, so that 
the displacement of the cam surface 51a, caused by the 
rotation of the wave plate 51, is transmitted via the rollers 
53, 54 to the double-headed piston 52. This in turn, causes 
the piston 52 to reciprocate. The cycle with which the piston 
52 reciprocates can be represented according to a displacement 
curve of the wave plate's cam surfaces 51a and 51b. With a two 
cycle curve, when there are two portions on the displacement 
curve corresponding to top and bottom dead center positions 
of the piston 52, the piston 52 reciprocates twice to perform 
two compression cycles. During this time, the wave plate 51 
makes only one complete revolution. The above wave plate type compressor has the following 
disadvantages. The rollers 53, 54 are rotatably supported by 
the piston in such a way as to roll over the cam surfaces as 
the wave plate 51 turns. However, when the support portions 
of the piston 52 cause
