<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrodeposition bath of platinum 
alloy which has characteristics superior to that of pure platinum in 
terms of luster and high hardness and allows thick plating and to a 
process for manufacturing a platinum alloy electrodeposited product 
using the same. Platinum is widely used as a noble metal material for 
decoration. Such decorative platinum are obtained using a known 
platinum plating bath, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. Hei-2-107794. However, such conventional platinum plating baths have problems 
in that they give deposits with lusterless appearance or low hardness, 
cannot achieve thick plating or has inconsistent deposition efficiency, 
and thus they are not very preferable for decoration. 
In addition, industrial use of such platinum plating has been limited 
to the fields such as electrodes manufacturing. The present invention is to provide a platinum alloy 
electrodeposition bath employing no pure platinum but an alloy of 
platinum and other metals, whereby allowing thick plating, giving  
 
lustrous or high-hardness platinum alloy layers, and a process for 
manufacturing a platinum alloy electrodeposited product using the 
same. In the preceding and following descriptions, the term 
"electrodeposition" is used as having a broad concept which includes 
electroplating and electro forming. These and other objects of the invention will become more 
apparent upon a reading of the following detailed description and 
embodiments. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, the platinum 
alloy electrodeposition bath according to this invention contains 2 
to 100 g/lit. of platinum in the form of Pt(OH)₆²⁻ complex ion and 
at least one of Sn, Zn and Pd in an amount of 1 mg/lit. or more. In this case, Sn assumes a stable state in the form of Sn(OH)₆²⁻ 
and allows to give excellent platinum-tin alloy layers. Further, Zn assumes a stable state if it is present in the bath 
in the form of Zn(OH)₃- or Zn(OH)₄²⁻ and allows to give excellent 
platinum-zinc alloy layers. Pd is stable when it is present in the bath in the form of 
complex ion expressed by [Pd(NH₃)n]²⁺ , wherein n is 1 to 4. In this 
case, a halogen anion such as I⁻ , B⁻ , Cl⁻ and F⁻ may further be 
coordinated. Meanwhile, stability of Pd can further be increased by 
allowing amidosulfuric acid (sulfamic acid), potassium amidosulfate 
(potassium sulfamate) or sodium amidosulfate (sodium sulfamate) to 
be present in the electrodeposition bath.  If Pd is reacted with
