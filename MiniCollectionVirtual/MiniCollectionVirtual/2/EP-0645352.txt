<ABSTRACT>
Transparent substrate (1), especially made of glass, provided with a stack of thin layers comprising essentially and successively starting from the substrate:     - a first layer of dielectric material (2) - a first layer with properties of reflection in the infrared, especially metallic (3)   - a second layer of dielectric material (4) - a second layer with properties of reflection in the infrared, especially metallic (5)   - a third layer of dielectric material (6) - a third layer with properties of reflection in the infrared, especially metallic (7)   - a fourth layer of dielectric material (8).   The thickness of the third layer with properties of reflection in the infrared (7) is greater than that of the second layer with properties of reflection in the infrared (5), itself greater than that of the first layer with properties in the infrared (3).
