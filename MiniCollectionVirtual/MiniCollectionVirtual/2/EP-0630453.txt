<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid valve assembly (1), subject to high vibration and shock induced loading, providing both axial and radial motion restraint of critical valve structures as economical means for achieving structural integrity. The valve comprises locking means (43) for releasably attaching the solenoid assembly (3) to the solenoid valve train (19). A mounting adapter (27) is attached to the solenoid valve train (19). This adaptor (27) has an external frustoconically mateable surface interactable with a flux ring (7) positioned between the adaptor and the shell (5) of the solenoid assembly (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
solenoid valves. In one of its aspects it relates
to the assembly of solenoid valves. In another of
its aspects it relates to improving the resistance
to failure of solenoid valve assemblies which
encounter mechanical stress.Solenoid valves have become a mainstay in
the everyday operation of machinery. They find use
in items ranging from household heating and cooling
systems to automobile engines to control systems
for the largest of modern construction equipment.
They are particularly important in uses requiring
instant response.Solenoid valves provided with replaceable
solenoid assemblies have in recent years been
designed utilizing computers to optimize the size,
weight, material of construction and all other
aspects that contribute to their improved
usefulness in specialized applications. As the
environments for these specialized applications
have become increasingly hostile in recent years,
valves designed for specific purposes can meet
conditions in operation that involve stresses that
approach the stress limitations of their design.
For example, in heavy machinery applications of
recent design, the valves can be subjected to high
vibrational frequencies greatly exceeding those 
encountered in previous applications, with the
result that even small design gaps resulting from
machine tolerances can result in large stresses
threatening the mechanical integrity of the
components.It is essential that such solenoid valves
maintain their structural integrity for long
periods of time, because premature failure of a
solenoid valve under operating conditions has
potentially serious results. Moreover, repair of a
prematurely failed solenoid valve results in
unanticipated maintenance and higher costs to the
operator. Furthermore, loss of use of some large
moving and construction equipment for even a short
time can be costly.It has been found that solenoid valves
used in such equipment, installed in a standard
configuration with the solenoid housing shell
extending from the mounting and assembled with
industry standard internal tolerances, can be
subjected to conditions that cause excessive
vibration, acting much like a bell vibrating on a
fixed clapper, that builds up cantilever-type
stress forces that result in mechanical failure of
the coil and valve assembly.In the solenoid valve assemblies that
suffer the vibrational problems that inspired the
present invention, a mounting adapter attached to a
solenoid valve train is juxtaposed at an external
surface with an internal
