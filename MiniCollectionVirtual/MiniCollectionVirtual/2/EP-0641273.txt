<ABSTRACT>
A hand tool for applying a ferrule (22) to a safety cable (20) is disclosed having a ferrule positioning device (52) to position the ferrule while a safety cable is placed therethrough, a tensioning mechanism (82) for applying tension to the cable, and a crimping mechanism (46, 50) to attach the ferrule to the safety cable. A pair of handles (26, 28) are pivotally attached to each other and are associated with the crimping mechanism such that when the handles are squeezed together, the crimping mechanism deforms the ferrule to attach it to the safety cable. The hand tool also incorporates a locking device (144) to prevent the handles from moving towards each other until a predetermined tension has been placed in the safety cable, and a ratchet device (112) to prevent the handles from returning to their initial positions until the ferrule has been properly crimped onto the safety cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hand tool for applying a ferrule to a safety cable
passing through a plurality of threaded fasteners to prevent the unintentional unthreading of
such fasteners.In rotary machinery having close tolerances between rotating and stationary elements,
such as turbines, it is imperative that all objects, no matter how small, be kept from contact
with the rotating elements of the machinery. The presence of any foreign object could result
in the catastrophic failure of the entire machine.Such machinery is inherently complex and requires many nuts, bolts, screws and
other threaded fasteners to assemble all of its components. Since the operation of such
machinery may involve very high rotating speeds, which may induce vibrations into the
machine elements it is necessary to provide some means for preventing the inadvertent
unthreading of the numerous threaded fasteners. It is known to apply lock wires to threaded fasteners to prevent their
inadvertent unthreading. Typically, the lock wire passes through a
transverse hole in at least two threaded fasteners and is twisted back on
itself in alternating clockwise and counterclockwise directions between the
threaded fasteners. The process is duplicated between additional threaded
fasteners until the entire threaded fastener pattern has been safety wired.
Following the required stringing and twisting, the wire is cut and bent into
a certain position.While the known lock wire technique has provided satisfactory
results, it requires a very time consuming and laborious application
process. Often the final result is unsatisfactory due to variations in the
quantity and tautness of the twists, and the variations in the tension on
the lock wire. It has been estimated that annual losses of approximately
$10,000,000 are incurred just from re-working unacceptable lock wire
assemblies.US-A-Specification 4 966 600, on which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, shows a tensioning device as a hand tool for crimping a ferrule on
a surgical wire.EP-A-0 385 667 discloses a ratchet device on a hand crimping tool for
preventing return of the crimping mandrel until a full crimping position has
been reached.EP-A-0 390 760 shows a cutting means to perform a cutting operation
after a crimping procedure.The present invention provides apparatus for applying a ferrule to
a strand element such as a wire or a cable, including a tool body, a ferrule
positioning means associated with the tool body for positioning a ferrule
that has received a strand element inserted
