<ABSTRACT>
A length adjustable column (37) for chairs, tables or the like has a vertical tube (1) and a length adjustment element (2) arranged therein. For fixture to a base, a sleeve-like cone section (17) is provided, said sleeve-like cone section (17) being provided on its inner surface (22) with at least one recess (20) into which a projection engages. A plurality of such projections (21) spaced apart from one another are provided over the length of the vertical tube (1), so that the cone section (17), formed by half-shells (19) or simply slotted, can be locked at various heights on the vertical tube (1) in the direction of the axis (3).

<CLAIMS>
A longitudinally adjustable column (37) for chairs, tables or the like, 

characterized by
an upright tube (1, 1', 1'') with a central longitudinal axis (3), which 
- related to the axis (3) - comprises at least two projections (21, 34) 

disposed at a distance from each other and protruding outward from its 
external side (23), 
a pneumatic or hydropneumatic length-adjusting element (2) arranged 
concentrically of the central longitudinal axis (3) in the upright tube (1, 1', 

1''), and 
a sleeve-like cone section (17) with a external conical surface (24) to be 
inserted into a taper adapter (43) of a pedestal (39), with a internal side 

(22) for abutment on the external side (23) of the upright tube (1, 1', 1''), 
and with at least one recess (20, 30, 31) to fit over one of the projections 

(21, 34). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the cone section (17) is formed as a sleeve (26) divided by a slot 
(27). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the cone section (17) consists of two half shells (19, 19''). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 the recess is formed as a groove (20).  
 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 the recess is in the form of a groove and open towards 
a rim (28, 29) on the side of the end of the cone section (17) - related to the 

axis (3). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 the cone section (17) - related to the central 
longitudinal axis (3) - is arranged on the upright tube (1, 1', 
1'') 
approximately without play. 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that
 a projection is formed by a crimp (21). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in that
 a projection is formed by a annular deformation (34). 
A longitudinally adjustable column according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the sleeve (26) is made of hard elastic material.
