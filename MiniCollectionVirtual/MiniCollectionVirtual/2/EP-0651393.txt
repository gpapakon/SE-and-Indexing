<ABSTRACT>
A memory cell array is divided into a plurality of 
blocks selected by an upper row address and further 

divided into a plurality of sub blocks in a word line 
direction. Word line driving circuits are provided 

individually for each of the sub blocks. Further, a 
plurality of word line driving current supplying circuits 

are provided which are selectively activated in 
response to an input of all or part of an upper row 

address for selection of one of the plurality of blocks 
to supply word line driving current to the word line 

driving circuits. The word line driving circuits in the 
same column direction are supplied with word line driving 

current by way of at least two signal lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device, and more particularly to a semiconductor memory
device which includes a word line driving circuit of the
divisional decoding type.The degree of integration of semiconductor memory
devices increases with advances in the technology in
fine working technique. In particular, high integration
has been achieved with dynamic random access memories
(hereinafter referred to as DRAMS) which have a simple
memory structure, and at present, DRAMs of 16 Mbits are
being mass-produced and sample shipment of DRAMs of 64
Mbits is also planned.64-Mbit DRAMs are semiconductor memory devices of
the divisional decoding type wherein word lines are
divided into a plurality of blocks and a word line
driving circuit for supplying current is provided for
each block of word lines to achieve high speed driving
of the word lines.Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the basic
construction of a semiconductor memory device of the
divisional decoding type, and Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram 
of a word line driving circuit represented by WD1a
in Fig. 1.A memory cell array is divided into a plurality of
blocks each selected by an upper row address, and each
block is divided into a plurality of sub blocks SB1a to
SB1c, SB2a to SB2c and SB3a to SB3c in the word line
direction.Word line driving circuits WD1a to WD1d are
disposed in a manner such that sub block SB1a, SB1b,
SB1c lie between word line driving circuit WD1a and
WD1b, WD1b and WD1c, WD1c and WD1d, resectively. Word
line driving circuits WD2a to WD2d, WD3a to WD3d and
WD4a to WD4d are disposed with respect to sub block SB2a
to SB2c, SB3a to SB3c and SB4a to SB4c in the same way
as word line driving circuits WD1a to WD1d. Word lines
in sub block SB1a are alternately connected with word
line driving circuit WD1a and WD1b. Similarly, word
lines in sublock SB1b, SB1c, ... , SB4c are alternately
connected with word line driving circuit WD1b and WD1c,
WD1c and WD1d, ... , WD4c and WD4d, respectively.Further, sensing amplifiers SA1a to SA1c, SA2a to
SA2c, SA3a to SA3c and SA4a to SA4c for amplifying data
of bit lines are provided for sub blocks SB1a to SB1c,
SB2a to SB2c, SB3a to SB3c and SB4a to SB4c,
respectively. Sensing amplifiers SA1a to SA1c, SA2a to
SA2c, SA3a to SA3c and SA4a to SA4c are determined by 
upper row address signals S1 and S2 and are selectively
activated by block select signals BLS1 to BLS4 outputted
from block select signal generation circuit BSG1.Memory cells MC0 and MC1 are disposed at points at
which word lines
