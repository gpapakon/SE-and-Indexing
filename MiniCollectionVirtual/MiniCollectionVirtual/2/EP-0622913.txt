<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical transmitting apparatus
used for optical communication.From document EP-A-0534644 there is known an optical transmitting apparatus, having
a light source, a wavelength selecting element, an optical fiber, and an optical/electrical
converter. A transmitter adds a pilot carrier or signal to the data to be transmitted. The
frequency of the pilot carrier is chosen to be below or above the frequency band applied
to the data. The optical filter controller generates a frequency so that it coincides with that
of the transmitted optical carrier signal.From document EP-A-0530025 there is already known an optical transmitting apparatus
with a light source, a fiber, and tunable filter, whereby the center of wavelength of the
transmission of the band pass filter can be adjusted. This document teaches to set the
transmission bandwidth of the filter to coincide with high precision with the center of the
wavelength of transmission.Document EP-A-0381341 discloses an apparatus wherein an optical branching device is
used for the detection of an optical signal.Recently, optical communication systems tend to
transmit a larger amount of data at a higher rate through a
longer distance. To meet these needs, several technologies
of controlling the wavelength of the light have been
studied.For example, there has been performed an attempt to
insert an optical filter into a transmitting path to improve
the quality of a transmitting signal, and performed a
wavelength multi-transmission by which a plurality of
optical signals having different wavelengths are multiplexed
so that a multi-channel transmission is performed through a
length of an optical fiber.These optical transmitting apparatus comprise a light
source drive section for receiving an input signal, an
output light source, an optical filter, an optical fiber for  
transmitting a signal, an optical/electrical converter, and
a demodulator. When an optical signal is transmitted, a
directly modulated output light from the output light source
develops a wavelength spread called a chirping. Where a
bias current of the output light source is significantly
higher than a threshold current, the wavelength is shifted
when the modulated pulse is on or off. Therefore, inserting
the optical filter causes only an on-level signal light
having a short wavelength to be passed. This causes an off-level
light having a long wavelength to be removed, thereby
increasing the extinction ratio of a transmitting signal and
improving the transmitting quality
