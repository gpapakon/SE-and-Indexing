<ABSTRACT>
An electric toothbrush having in its slip-on brush a piston is disclosed, which is set rotating by a motor shaft projecting out of the handle segment. This piston exhibits a lifting cam, by means of which it effects an axial motion relative to the motor shaft in the slip-on brush. This axial motion causes a reciprocating motion of a toothed rack, which sets the bristle tufts of the toothbrush rotating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric toothbrush with an 
electric motor, which generates a motion of rotation and has a 
motor shaft, a gear that converts the motion of rotation into 
a reciprocating stroke, and a slip-on brush, which is to be 
attached to a handle segment so as not to be rotatable in said 
handle segment and which has a reciprocatable toothed rack in 
order to drive the rotatable bristle carriers. Such an electric toothbrush 
comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1, 
is the subject matter of the 
EP-B-O 254 397. In the case of the toothbrush known in this 
document a contrate gear, which is driven by means of a pinion 
by the electric motor in the handle segment, is disposed in an 
eccentric, from which a crank arm leads to a reciprocatable 
connecting rod that leads out of the handle segment. This 
connecting rod couples with a toothed rack in the slip-on 
brush, when said brush is slid on the handle segment. The 
toothed rack generates in turn an alternating motion of rotation 
of the individual bristle carriers in the brush head. If one wants to attain an adequately long stroke of the 
toothed rack, so that the bristle tufts exert more than one 
rotation at each stroke, the connecting rod leading out of the 
handle segment must execute an equally long stroke. That requires 
an eccentric, which is offset on the contrate gear by 
half the stroke. The result is automatically a relatively 
large diameter of the contrate gear, so that the diameter of 
the handle segment, too, must be correspondingly large, a 
feature that is often undesired.  
 The problem on which the invention is based is to design 
an electric toothbrush of the aforementioned kind in such a 
manner that its gear can be arranged to convert the motion of 
rotation of the electric motor into a reciprocating motion 
even while generating a longer stroke in toothbrushes with a 
small diameter. This problem is solved by the invention 
as defined in claim 1. Such a gear has a small space requirement in the radial 
direction of the toothbrush, even if a large stroke has to be 
generated with it, because this stroke is generated by the 
course of the lifting cam; and the desired stroke can be 
generated exclusively by extending the lifting cam in the 
axial direction or by arranging several lifting cams in succession. 
Despite this advantage, the toothbrush according to 
the invention is constructed very simply, so that it can be 
manufactured inexpensively and the risk of malfunctioning is 
low. The lifting cam can

<CLAIMS>
An electric toothbrush having a handle segment 
(1) and a slip-on brush (2) defining a longitudinal axis 

therethrough; a motor shaft (4) extending within the 
handle segment (1) and aligned substantially parallel to 

the longitudinal axis thereof; an electric motor (3) 
located within the handle segment (1) for rotating the 

motor shaft (4) about the longitudinal axis of the motor 
shaft (4); a reciprocal toothed rack (8) located within 

the slip-on brush (2) which extends substantially 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the electric 

toothbrush; and a rotatable bristle tuft (9) operatively 
connected to the reciprocal toothed rack (8); 

characterized in that the toothbrush comprises: 

(a) a gear (6) mounted for rotation with the 
motor shaft (4) and for sliding movement along the motor 

shaft (4), the gear (6) being operatively connected to 
the reciprocal toothed rack (8) so as to convert the 

rotation of the motor shaft (4) into a reciprocating 
stroke of the reciprocal toothed rack (8); and 
(b) a first lifting cam (11) and a first cam 
follower (12) interacting with the first lifting cam (11) 

and associated with the gear (6) such that when the gear 
(6) is in the revolving motion of rotation, the first 

lifting cam (11) and first cam follower (12) cause the 
gear (6) to oscillate back and forth along the motor 

shaft (4) thereby causing a reciprocating stroke of the 
reciprocal toothed rack (8) and a corresponding 

rotational movement of the rotatable bristle tuft (9). 
The electric toothbrush of Claim 1, and further 
comprising: 


(a) an extension (13) fixed on the gear (6) on 
the side of the gear (6) facing away from the motor (3); 

and  
 
(b) a second lifting cam (14) and second cam 
follower (16) interacting with the second lifting cam 

(14), the second lifting cam (14) positioned to rotate 
with the gear (6) and the second cam follower (16) 

connected to the reciprocal rack (8) such that when the 
gear (6) is rotating, the extension (13) rotates 

therewith which acts to increase the distance of the 
reciprocating stroke of the reciprocal rack (8). 
The electric toothbrush of Claim 2, and further 
comprising a rack holder (15) in the shape of a 

cylindrical sleeve fixed to the reciprocal rack (8) and 
colinearly extending therefrom in the direction of the 

gear (6), the second cam follower (16) being fixed in the 
rack holder (15) and the extension (13) telescoping 

within the rack holder (15).

wherein the first lifting cam (11) is a guide groove that 

extends on the outer surface of the gear (6), the guide 
groove engaging the first cam follower (12) which is 

fixed to the slip-on brush (2).

wherein the diameter of the extension (13) is smaller 

than the diameter of the gear (6). 
The electric toothbrush of Claim 2, wherein the 
first lifting cam (11) and the second lifting cam (14) 

are oriented in opposing directions such that as the gear 
(6) moves axially outward on the motor shaft (4) relative 

to the motor (3), the reciprocal rack (8) moves axially 
outward relative to the extension (13). 
The electric toothbrush of Claim 1, and further 
comprising a radially extending guide pin (24) associated  

 
with the reciprocal rack (8) for movement therewith, and 

a guide groove (25, 26) extending longitudinally in the 
slip-on brush (2), the guide pin (24) engaging the guide 

groove (25, 26) so as to rotationally fix the reciprocal 
rack (8) in the slip-on brush (2) during a reciprocating
