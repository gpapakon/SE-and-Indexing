<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is mainly for use in semiconductor
manufacture and relates to an improvement in the method
of feeding gas into the deposition chamber so as to be
capable of suppressing pressure fluctuations when the gas
feed is changed.Figure 4 is a schematic block diagram showing an example
of gas piping system at present in use in a semiconductor
manufacturing plant. This piping system comprises a
processing or deposition chamber 20, a reactive gas feed
line 22 consisting of a chamber pressure regulator 21 and
a line changeover valve V1' i.e. a valve capable of
opening and closing the line to the transmission of gas,
an inert gas feed line 24 consisting of a chamber
pressure regulator 23 and a line changeover valve V2', a
vacuum exhaust line 25 connected to the chamber 20, and
a vacuum pump 26 connected to the vacuumexhaust line 25.V3' and V4' are shunt valves for vent pipe connected to
the primary side of the line changeover valves V1', V2';
27 is a vacuum gauge connected to the chamber, and V is
a switch valve placed in the vacuum exhaust line 25.In this gas pipeing system, into the chamber 20 evacuated 
and exhausted by the vacuum pump 26, reactive gas is
supplied from the reactive gas feed line 22 and inert gas
from the inert gas feed line 24, alternately, thereby
processing to form a film on a wafer in the chamber 20.
The flow rate of reactive gas and inert gas supplied into
the chamber 20 is controlled by the chamber pressure
regulators 21, 23 placed in the lines 22, 24 so that the
pressure in the chamber 20 may be a pressure suited to
film forming process.Along with the trend of high integration of
semiconductors the film thickness of the wafer now needs
to be thin, and it is difficult to control the film
thickness. One of the factors to disturb the film
thickness is pressure fluctuations in the chamber at the
time of changeover of the gas feed lines.In the conventional gas piping system, the flow rate of
gas is controlled by the chamber pressure regulars 21,
23 so that the pressure in the chamber 20 may be kept at
a set pressure. However, when the gas feed lines 22, 24
are changed over, inevitably, pressure fluctuations occur
in the chamber 20. As a result, the film thickness of the
wafer varies, or plasma fails to occur in the chamber 20.
It took a considerably long time until the pressure in
the chamber 20 is stabilised, and a time loss was caused. Figures 5 to 8 are graphs showing test results of
pressure fluctuation tests of the chamber 20 at the time
of line changeover by using the
