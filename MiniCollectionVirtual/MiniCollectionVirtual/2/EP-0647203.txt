Device for continously loading, transporting and distributing helical springs (12) comprising 
a first vibrating means (16) and a second vibrating means (16) and a flexible tube (10) in which 

the springs are juxtaposed coaxially, the tube (10) being long and wound around a movable 
support (14), the first vibrating means (16) being provided with fixing means (25) for this 

movable support (14), for the loading of the springs, this tube having at its only free end means 
of connection to a machine (22) for making springs, and the second vibrating means (16), of the 

same type as the first vibrating means but separate therefrom, also being provided with fixing 
means (25) for this movable support, the connection means for the tube also being connectable 

to a machine (26) for distributing springs, notably a distribution pen. 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
support is a spindle (14) which receives the wound up tube (10). 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the springs (12) are oriented and with an identical winding direction within the same tube (10). 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised in that the diameter of the tube (10) is bigger than the diameter of the spring (12) 
so as to leave a clearance which allows the spring (12) to move within the tube (10). 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the tube (10) has a friction coefficient limited so as to facilitate translational 

movements of the said springs (12) along the tube (10). 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that 
the tube (10) is made of polyethylene and the clearance is between 0.2 and 1 mm. 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the vibrating means (16) have a given polarity for a given helical winding 

direction of the springs (12) and comprising a polarity reverser so as to cause the springs to be  
 

inserted or evacuated (12) from the tube (10) in the same winding direction of these springs 
(12). 
Loading, transport and distribution device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
vibrations are emitted in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the spindle (14). 
Packaging of springs (12) loaded by means of the loading, transport and distribution device 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, the packaging comprising a movable support spindle (14) 

provided with means of fixing (25) onto a vibrator (18) and a long flexible tube (10) wound 
around the spindle (14), the tube comprising at its free end connection means (24) with a 

machine for fabricating springs (22) and with spring distribution means (26), notably with a 
distribution pen.
