internal combustion engine with a variable valve timing

system, an electronic engine control module has a
microprocessor programmed to perform selecting one of

a first control mode in which an intake-air quantity of
the engine is controlled by adjusting the throttle

opening, and a second control mode in which an intake-air
quantity of the engine is controlled by adjusting the

intake-valve closure timing. The microprocessor is
programmed to perform calculating a desired value of the

intake-air quantity based on engine operating conditions,
in accordance with a predetermined time-delay

characteristic between initiation of adjustment of the
throttle opening and an actual change in an internal

pressure in the intake-air passage. The microprocessor
is also programmed calculating a target throttle opening

based on the operating conditions, and setting a target
intake-valve closure timing at a basic intake-valve

closure timing, when the first control mode is selected.
Conversely when the second control mode is selected, by

means of the microprocessor, the target throttle opening
is set at a predetermined throttle opening, and the target

intake-valve closure timing is calculated based on the
desired value of the intake-air quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the improvements of an intake-air quantity control apparatus for an internal combustion engine equipped with a variable valve timing system capable of electronically arbitrarily controlling an intake- and/or exhaust-valve timing depending on engine/vehicle operating conditions, and specifically to techniques for controlling engine power output (a quantity of intake air entering an internal combustion engine) by adjusting an intake-valve open timing (often abbreviated to "IVO") and an intake-valve closure timing (often abbreviated to "IVC").In recent years, there have been proposed and developed various electronically-controlled variable valve timing systems which are capable of operating intake and exhaust valves electromagnetically. One such electronically-controlled variable valve timing system for an internal combustion engine having electromagnetically-powered valve units has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 10-311231. In the Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 10-311231 or in DE 198 47 851 A, each of intake and exhaust valves is comprised of an electromagnetic solenoid valve whose opening and closing are achieved by way of an electromagnetic force instead of the use of a typical cam-drive mechanism. Thus, an intake-valve open timing (IVO), an intake-valve open timing (IVO), an exhaust-valve open timing (EVO), and an exhaust-valve closure timing (EVC) can be continually changed in response to command signals from an electronic control module (ECM). In such internal combustion engines with a variable valve timing control system having electromagnetically-powered valve units, an intake-air quantity can be adjusted by properly controlling or managing an intake valve timing (IVO and/or IVC), in place of throttle-opening adjustment. In this type of engines with electromagnetically-powered engine valve units, a throttle valve is often eliminated, or a throttle valve is installed on the engine only for the purpose of generation of a negative pressure in an intake-air passage. Suppose an internal pressure in the intake-air passage reaches a pressure level close to atmospheric pressure with the throttle kept at an extremely less throttle opening. In this case, the intake-air quantity control system based on adjustment of an intake-valve opening time period (a time interval between IVO and IVC) is superior to that based on only the throttle-opening adjustment, from the viewpoint of reduced pumping loss and reduced fuel consumption rate.In
