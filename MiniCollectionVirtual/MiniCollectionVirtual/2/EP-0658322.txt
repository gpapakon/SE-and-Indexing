<ABSTRACT>
A wrist restraining glove(110) comprises a hand receiving 
portion(111) for receiving a hand(H), a wrist band(113) 

integrally joined to the hand receiving portion(111), and a 
tension member(115) integrally joined on the palmar surface 

of at least the hand receiving portion(111). When the glove 
is worn on the hand, the wrist band(113) is wrapped around a 

wrist. The tension member(115) exerts a tensile force when 
pulled longitudinally, thereby an outward pivotal movement of 

the hand about the wrist can be suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a wrist restraining glove which is suitable for golfing and
by which an unnecessary pivotal movement of the wrist can be
suppressed to enable an accurate and powerful swing of a golf
club.The present invention also relates to
a wrist restraining glove which is also suitable for
sports such as baseball, tennis and by which an unnecessary
pivotal movement of the wrist can be suppressed to reduce arm
fatigue.The present invention further relates to
a wrist restraining glove which is suitable for
driving and physical working to reduce arm fatigue.It is well-known that pivotal movement of the hand about
the wrist during a swing of a golf club greatly influences the
direction and speed of a ball hit by the club. For example as
shown in Fig.37A-37B, during a swing of a golf club 1, the
pivotal movement of a hand 50 about a wrist 53 within a plane
parallel to the back 51 of the hand 50 (the pivotal movement as 
shown by an arrow "X" in Fig.37A, which is called as "a
cocking pivotal movement" in a golf swing) is effective for
making a powerful swing to increase the speed of a ball hit by
a club without varying the direction of flight of the ball.However, the pivotal movement of the hand 50 about the
wrist 53 to the direction perpendicular to the back 51 of the
hand 50 (the pivotal movement as shown by an arrow "Y" in
Fig.37B) is undesirable because it results in a decreased
speed of the ball and incorrect direction of flight.US Patent No 2154197 discloses a wrist restraining glove
that has a hand receiving portion and a cuff or wristlet
integrally joined thereto, in which a number of pockets are
provided extending lengthwise across the wrist partly on the
side and partly on the back or front of the glove, and these
pockets contain resilient stays which are not rigidly attached
to the glove but are held by the pockets across the wrist
joint to oppose movement in certain directions.US Patent No 3606343 is another attempt at improving a
golf swing in which a wristlet of elastic or cloth is
connected by a cord to finger loops.In the approach taken by the
present invention, in particular, it is desirable during a
swing of a golf club to permit or induce the pivotal movement
of the hand 50 about the wrist within the plane parallel to
the back 51 of the hand 50, but it is desirable to suppress 
the pivotal movement of the hand 50 about the wrist 53 in a
direction perpendicular to the back 51 of the hand 50
(movement in an outer direction perpendicular to the back 51).However, it is

<CLAIMS>
A wrist restraining glove (110) for restraining
pivotal movement of the hand about the wrist comprising a hand

receiving portion (111) and a wristlet (113) integrally joined
to said hand receiving portion; 
characterised by
a tension member (115) integrally joined with a palmar
portion of the hand receiving portion (111) and

with the wristlet (113) so as to be placed in tension by
and to exert a tensile force against outward pivotal

movement of the hand (H) about the wrist.
A wrist restraining glove according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 said tension member (115) is made
of resilient material and is elongated on the palmar surface as

it extends from the wristlet to the hand receiving portion.
A wrist restraining glove according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 said wristlet has band members
(113) having opposite ends (114) provided with interengageable

male (114a) and female (114b) fastening means for keeping said
wristlet in firm engagement around the wrist.
A wrist restraining glove according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 at least a part of said wristlet
(113) is extensible around the wrist.
A wrist restraining glove (410) according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 a longitudinal cut out (416) and
a flap member (417) are provided on a back of the hand

receiving portion (411), the flap member being pivotable away
from and toward the back of the hand to open and to fasten the

longitudinal cut-out in closed condition. 
A wrist restraining glove (410) according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 the tension member (415) exerts
the tensile force against an outward pivotal movement of the

hand about the wrist independently of the fingers, and further
comprising:


an elongate cut-out (416) formed to extend longitudinally
through a back of the hand receiving portion (411) and the

wristlet (412); and
a flap member (417) provided on the back of both said hand
receiving portion and said wristlet, the flap member being

pivotable away from and toward the back of the hand
receiving portion to open and to fasten the cut-out

closed.
A wrist restraining glove (450) according to claim 6,

further characterised in that
 a pocket (459a,459b) is formed in
the flap member (459), and a resilient restraining plate (459c)

made of resilient material is loosely inserted therein to
suppress an outward pivotal movement of the hand about the

wrist.
A wrist restraining glove (450') according to
claim 6, 
further characterised in that
 a notch (459d',459e') is
formed medially of the flap member (459') to facilitate a

lateral pivotal movement of the hand about the wrist.
A wrist restraining glove (550) according to claim 6,

further characterised in that
 a resilient restraining plate
(555) made of resilient material is integrally joined to the

outer surface of the flap member (559), said restraining plate
having a greater resistance to bending in an outward direction

than to bending in a lateral direction, perpendicular to the
outward direction. 
A wrist restraining glove according to claim 9,

further characterised in that
 said restraining plate (555) has
a gourd-shape configuration comprising a narrow medial portion

(555b) interconnecting respective wide portions (555c,555a)
thereof adjacent the wrist and fingers, respectively.
A wrist restraining glove according to claim 10,

 said medial, narrow portion
(555b) is thicker than said portions (555c,555a) adjacent the

wrist and fingers, respectively.
A wrist restraining glove (120) according to claim 1
or claim 6, 
further characterised in that
 the hand receiving
portion (121) is fingerless and includes an annular, palm

receiving portion (121) from which a wearer's fingers extend in
exposed condition.
A wrist restraining glove (180) according to claim 1,

further characterised in that
 said tension member (185) is
provided in a cut-out (182) to exert an inward tensile force

against an outward pivotal movement of the hand about the
wrist.
