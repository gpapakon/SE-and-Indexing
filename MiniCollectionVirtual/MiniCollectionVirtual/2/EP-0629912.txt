<ABSTRACT>
A magenta coupler and a light sensitive silver halide 
color photographic material containing the coupler are 

disclosed. The magenta coupler is represented by formulas 

wherein R₁ is a hydrogen atom or a substituent, R₂, R₃ and R₄ 
each represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent, L is an 

alkylene group, n is 0 or 1, R₅ and R₆ each represents a 
hydrogen atom or a substituent, where R₅ and R₆ may be 

condensed to form a cycle, and X is a hydrogen atom or an atom 
or a group that can be released upon the reaction with an 

oxidation product of color developing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide color
photographic light sensitive material containing a magenta
coupler and, particularly, to a silver halide color
photographic light sensitive material in which a color
reproducibility and color reproducibility can be excellent and
a dye image stable against heat and light can be obtained when
containing a novel pyrazoloazole type magenta coupler therein.As for the couplers generally applicable to silver halide
color photographic light sensitive materials, there have been
known couplers including, for example, the yellow couplers
each comprising a open-chained ketomethylene type compound,
the magenta couplers each comprising a pyrazolone or
pyrazoloazole type compound and the cyan couplers each
comprising a phenol or naphthol type compound. Among them, a 
5-pyrazolone compound has very often been used for the magenta
couplers so far.The known pyrazolone magenta couplers are described in,
for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,600,788 and 3,519,429 and
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection
(hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) Nos. 49-111631(1974)
and 57-35858(1982). However, the dyes made of
the pyrazolone magenta couplers have produced an undesirable
side-absorption and there has been demand for improvement,
as described in 'The Theory of the Photographic Process', the
4th Ed., Macmillan Publishing Co., 1977, pp.356 - 358; 'Fine
Chemical', Vol.14, No.8, CMC Press, pp.38 - 41; and the
Lecture Transcription published at the 1985 Annual convention
of the Society of Photographic Science of Japan, pp.108 - 110.As described in the documents referred to above, the dyes
made of the pyrazoloazole type magenta couplers do not produce
any side-absorption. The documents referred to above, U.S. Patent
Nos. 3,725,067, 3,758,309 and 3,810,761 and so forth describe
that the couplers of this type are excellent.However, the light-fastness of azomethine dyes made of
the couplers is so seriously low that the characteristics of
color photographic light sensitive materials, particularly
those of print type color photographic light sensitive
materials are seriously affected.Various studies and researches have been tried for improving
the light-fastness. For example, JP OPI Publication Nos. 59-125732(1984), 
61-282845(1986), 61-292639(1986) and 61-279855(1986)
disclose the techniques of making use of a
combination of a pyrazoloazole type coupler and a phenol
type compound or a phenylether compound and JP OPI
