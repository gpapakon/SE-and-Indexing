<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved 
moisture-management garment (10) and support garment including 

a moisture-management panel (11) which extends from an upper 
crotch area (12) of the garment to a lower crotch area (13) of the 

garment (10). The panel (11) includes an inner fabric layer (14), 
intermediate fabric layer (15), and an outer fabric layer (16). 

The inner fabric layer (14) is constructed of wicking yarns 
for residing in skin contact during garment wear. The 

intermediate fabric layer (15) comprises one or more moisture 
transport inserts (15) which reside adjacent to the inner 

fabric layer (14) for transporting moisture away from the 
inner fabric layer (14) and away from the skin of the wearer. 

An outer fabric layer (16) resides adjacent the intermediate 
fabric layer (15) for receiving and dispersing moisture wicked 

outwardly from the inner (14) and intermediate (15) fabric layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 023,006, filed on February 26, 
1993, which is a continuation-in-part of application 
Serial No. 003,263, filed on January 12, 1993, which is a 
continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 991,761, 
filed on December 17, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part 
of application Serial No. 945,677, filed on 
September 16, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 842,224, filed on February 26, 
1992, which is a continuation-in-part of application 
Serial No. 791,066, filed on November 12, 1991. This invention relates to garments, particularly 
undergarments and panty hose for normal, regular and 
everyday use having a crotch area constructed from a 
moisture-management fabric. The invention also relates 
to support undergarments, such as athletic supporters, 
for particular use during recreation and exercise. The fabric composite from which these garments, or 
portions thereof, are constructed is intended to quickly 
move moisture away from the skin of the wearer, while 
enhancing the dispersion of the moisture to those fibers 
of the fabric which do not touch the skin, and  
 
facilitating its evaporation through the outer shell. 
One such fabric is the "Coolmax" or "Thermax" fabric 
manufactured by DuPont. This fabric, when incorporated 
in the present invention, is particularly effective for 
wicking moisture away from the skin of the wearer, and 
not adding noticeable bulk to the crotch area of the 
garment. Typical moisture-management garments include 
several layers of moisture absorbing material and a 
moisture barrier material to prevent leakage through the 
garment onto outer clothing. These type undergarments 
are expensive, bulky, and generally quite uncomfortable. 
Moreover, these undergarments usually include a 
continuous front panel constructed entirely of 
moisture-absorbing fabric layers, having no fly opening. The present invention eliminates this problem by 
providing an undergarment with a fly opening that does 
not compromise the undergarment's ability to effectively 
absorb and disperse moisture to drier areas of the 
garment for evaporation. The particular fly opening 
satisfies the long felt need for a garment possessing all 
the features of a normal undergarment with the addition 
of moisture-management characteristics. Moroever, the 
crotch area of the present invention retains the feel and  
 
appearance of a regular brief, but with superior features 
for managing perspiration. The
