<ABSTRACT>
An 8→10 modulator (13/22) stores a conversion table, 
and, when receiving 8-bit data as an address, outputs 

10-bit data stored at the received address as a modulated 
code. The conversion table of the 8→10 modulator is 

constructed such that each NRZI-represented 10-bit datum 
includes at least one "0."

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coding and decoding methods 
and to magnetic recording apparatus suitable for use in 
recording information onto a magnetic recording medium such 
as a magnetic tape, a magnetic disk or a magneto-optical 
disk. In, for example, the DAT (digital audio tape recorder) 
or like apparatuses, data is recorded onto a magnetic tape 
after being subjected to block coding. That is, data is 
made 8-bit-unit data, for instance, and then converted to 
10-bit-unit codes (hereinafter referred to as "8-10 
conversion"). The 10-bit-unit conversion codes are 
subjected to NRZI (nonreturn to zero inverted) modulation, 
and then recorded onto the magnetic tape. Further, in this 
case, the data is recorded with such a recording linear 
density that no intersymbol interference occurs in 
reproducing the digital data or intersymbol interference 
can be eliminated even if it occurs. That is, as shown in Fig. 9 of the accompanying 
drawings, when the NRZI-modulated conversion codes are 
"10110100 ...." (Fig. 9(a)), the minimum inversion interval 
of the magnetization (indicated by arrows in Fig. 9(b)) on 
the magnetic tape is set at such an interval as causes no 
intersymbol interference during reproduction. As a result, in a reproducing operation, the 
reproduction signal assumes a signal as obtained by 
differentiating the NRZI-modulated conversion data (see 
Fig.  
 
9(c)). That is, the reproduction signal is such that the 
absolute value of a level (amplitude) corresponding to a 
position of inversion of magnetization on the magnetic tape 
(i.e., a position at which the NRZI-modulated conversion data 
takes "1") has approximately a prescribed level LA (> 0), and 
that of a position not corresponding to inversion of 
magnetization (i.e., a position at which the NRZI-modulated 
conversion data takes "0") has approximately a 0 level. Therefore, the original NRZI-modulated conversion codes 
can be restored by integrating the reproduction signal, and 
then judging whether the integrated signal is (or regarded as 
being) at the H level or L level, that is, performing a binary 
level judgment. However, in the DAT that does not utilize the 
intersymbol interference as described above, a large 
reproduction signal is needed in a high frequency band and the 
minimum inversion interval of magnetization on the magnetic 
tape should be sufficiently long. Therefore, the recording 
linear density cannot be increased any further. In view of the above, to improve the recording density, 
information recording and
