<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to process for 
preparing a coated substrate having improved resistance to 

yellowing which comprises coating a substrate with a 
one-component coating composition containing 


a) a blocked polyisocyanate which is the reaction product of 
a polyisocyanate with an oxime or lactam blocking
 agent 
for isocyanate groups and 
b) a compound containing at least two isocyanate-reactive 
groups,

 
provided that component a) and/or component b) contains 

the group, -CO-(R)N-N(R)-CO-, wherein R represents 
hydrogen or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical, 

in an amount of 0.01 to 5% by weight, based on the solids 
content of components a) and b), 
 
by applying the one-component coating composition wet-on-wet to 

a coating composition containing acid groups and/or melamine 
resins which has previously been applied to the substrate or by 

adding a melamine resin to the one-component coating 
composition prior to applying it to the substrate, which may 

optionally have been precoated. 
The present invention also relates to the coated 
substrate having improved resistance to yellowing prepared by 

this process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
coating a substrate with a one-component coating composition 
containing oxime- or lactam-blocked polyisocyanates in the 
presence of acids or melamine resins to provide a coated 
substrate with improved resistance to yellowing. There is a need in the automotive industry for 
topcoats which can be applied over existing basecoats and which 
provide improved properties when compared to conventional 
thermoset melamine/acrylics. Recently, two-component 
polyurethane coatings have increasingly been used as 
clearcoats. These coatings possess excellent environmental 
etch resistance as well as excellent appearance, durability, 
hardness and flexibility. The two-component polyurethane coating compositions 
suffer from one major disadvantage, i.e., they require 
two-component spray equipment as opposed to the thermoset 
melamine/acrylics which are applied using one-component 
equipment. Therefore, an additional capital expenditure is 
required to obtain the necessary spray equipment for applying 
the two-component polyurethane coating compositions. One possibility for providing a one-component 
polyurethane coating composition would be to convert the 
existing two-component polyurethane coating compositions by 
blocking the isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate component. 
In this regard oxime-blocking agents are the preferred blocking 
agent because they possess storage stability in combination 
with a low unblocking temperature. One of the difficulties of oxime- or lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanates is that when they come into contact with  
 
melamine resins or acids, they exhibit increased yellowing when 
compared to similar coatings which are not in contact with or 
blended with melamine resins or acids. The amount of yellowing 
increases as the curing temperature increases. Accordingly, 
blocking agents which require higher deblocking temperatures 
may suffer from increased yellowing due to the higher 
deblocking temperature. Such contact may occur when coating 
compositions containing oxime- or lactam-blocked polyisocyanates 
are applied as clearcoats over acid-containing 
and/or melamine-resin containing, thermoplastic or thermoset 
basecoats; when they are applied wet-on-wet as unicoats over 
acid-containing and/or melamine resin-containing primers; or 
when the coating compositions contain oxime- or lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanates in combination with acids and/or melamine 
resins. From the non prepublished EP-A 581040 are coating compositions known,
