<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer material comprises a supporting film, which is provided on at least one of its surfaces with a sealing layer inhibiting the passage of gases. Between the sealing layer and the surface of the supporting film facing it there is provided a finishing, dissipating the surface energy during application of the sealing layer. The sealing layer has on its surface facing away from the film a coating which prevents mechanical damage. It bears on its surface facing away from the film a coating consisting of organic materials. These may comprise a lubricant or resins, which firmly adhere on the sealing layer. The resins may take the form of synthetic resins. The coating may, however, also comprise waxes, which adhere firmly on the surface of the sealing layer facing away from the supporting film. They may take the form of synthetic waxes. The sealing layer may bear on its surface facing away from the film a coating consisting of organic materials. In a process for making a multilayer material inhibiting the passage of gases, a sealing layer is applied to at least one surface of a supporting film. Before the application of the sealing layer, there is applied to the surface of the supporting film facing the sealing layer a finishing by which the surface energy is dissipated during the application of the sealing layer. In another process for making a multilayer material inhibiting the passage of gases, a sealing layer is likewise applied to at least one surface of a supporting film. Before the application of the sealing layer, there is applied to the surface of the supporting film facing the sealing layer a finishing by which unevennesses of the surface are smoothed and a high-gloss surface is produced. In a third process for making a multilayer material inhibiting the passage of gases, a sealing layer is applied to at least one surface of the supporting film. Before the application of the sealing layer, there is applied to the surface of the supporting film facing the sealing layer a finishing by which the temperature resistance of the surface is increased.
