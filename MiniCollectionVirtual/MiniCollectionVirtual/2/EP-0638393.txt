<ABSTRACT>
A large capacity locking pliers includes a body, a 
fixed jaw, a movable jaw, and an over-center toggle linkage 

secured between the movable jaw and the body to lock the movable 
jaw in position with respect to the fixed jaw. The jaws define 

respective working surfaces, and each of the working surfaces 
defines an end portion, an intermediate portion, and a concave 

inner portion. The concave inner portion of the fixed jaw 
extends over an arc α of at least 45° and the concave inner 

portion of the movable jaw extends over an arc β of at least 80°. 
These concave inner portions are concentric when the movable jaws 

move to a selected open position to grip a large cylindrical 
workpiece. The fixed and movable jaws are asymmetrical in order 

to facilitate fabrication and finishing of the completed pliers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to locking pliers of the type
having a fixed jaw, a movable jaw, and an over-center toggle
linkage secured to the movable jaw to pivot the movable jaw about
a pivot axis and to lock the movable jaw in position with respect
to the fixed jaw, of the type as defined in the preamble of
claim 1.Many conventional locking pliers suffer from the
disadvantage of an inefficient gripping geometry for large
diameter workpieces. If an attempt is made to close a
conventional locking pliers on a large diameter workpiece, the
closing forces may tend to move the workpiece out of the open
jaws, in some cases preventing a stable grip from being obtained. A locking pliers of the type as described above is known from
US-A-4 989 479. The working surfaces of the movable jaw and the
fixed jaw of the known pliers are equally shaped with curved
portions having the same radii of curvature and extending over
the same arc angle. In order to improve the gripping properties
of the known pliers, both working surfaces are provided with
asymmetrically shaped teeth. The present invention is directed to an improved
locking pliers which is well suited to grip both large and small
diameter workpieces, while reducing or eliminating any tendency
of the workpiece to be pushed out of the pliers as the jaws are
closed.According to this invention, as claimed in claim 1, a large capacity locking
pliers is provided comprising a body, a fixed jaw and a movable
jaw. The fixed jaw is secured to the body and comprises a first
working surface. This first working surface comprises a first
end portion, a first intermediate portion, and a first concave
inner portion. The movable jaw is pivotably mounted to the body
to pivot with respect to the fixed jaw about a pivot axis that
is fixed with respect to the body. This movable jaw comprises
a second working surface opposed to the first working surface,
and this second working surface comprises a second end portion,
a second intermediate portion, and a second concave inner
portion. An over-center toggle linkage is secured between the 
movable jaw and the body to pivot the movable jaw about the pivot
axis and to lock the movable jaw in position with respect to the
fixed jaw. The first and second end portions are positioned to
abut one another in surface contact when the movable jaw is moved
to a selected closed position.The locking pliers defines a jaw axis extending between the pivot
axis and the first end portion. The first concave inner portion
deviates from the jaw axis by a maximum

<CLAIMS>
A large capacity locking pliers (10) comprising a body (12);

a fixed jaw (14) secured to the body (12) and comprising a first working surface
(16), said first working surface (16) comprising a first end portion (18), a first

intermediate portion (20), and a first concave inner portion (22),
a movable jaw (30) pivotably mounted to the body (12) to pivot with respect to the
fixed jaw (14) about a pivot axis (28) that is fixed with respect to the body (12),

said movable jaw (30) comprising a second working surface (32) opposed to the
first working surface (16), said second working surface (32) comprising a second

end portion (34), a second intermediate portion (36), and a second concave inner
portion (38);
an over-center toggle linkage (44) secured between the movable jaw (30) and the
body (12) to pivot the movable jaw (30) about the pivot axis (28) and to lock the

movable jaw (30) in position with respect to the fixed jaw (14); and
said first and second end portions (18,34) positioned to abut one another in
surface contact when the movable jaw (30) is moved to a closed position,
characterized in that
said first and second concave inner portions (22,38) are asymmetrical to one
another with respect to a jaw axis (J) defined by said locking pliers (10), said jaw

axis extending between the pivot axis (28) and the first end portion (18), wherein
the first concave inner portion (22) deviates from the jaw axis (J) by a maximum

value equal to X at a first location on the jaw axis (J), wherein the second inner
portion (38) when in the closed position deviates from the jaw axis (J) by a

maximum value equal to Y, at a second location on the jaw axis (J), wherein X/Y 
is less than 0.5, and wherein the first location is disposed between the pivot axis

(28) and the second location on the jaw axis γ.
The pliers of claim 1 wherein the concave inner portions (22,38) are cylindrical in
