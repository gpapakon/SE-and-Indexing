<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aerosol container for pharmaceutically active aerosols which are to be administered in specified quantities and are provided in the form of a suspension in the container, the suspension comprising at least a propellent gas in addition to a pharmaceutically active substance. The aerosol container (1) comprises a metering valve (2) which has a metering chamber (20) and a valve tube (21). In a first position of the valve tube, the metering chamber communicates with the interior of the container and is filled with a specified quantity of the aerosol. In a second position of the valve tube, it releases the quantity of the aerosol located in the metering chamber. The propellent gas is an alternative propellent gas which is free from chlorofluorocarbons, preferably a propellent gas comprising only fluorocarbons, and the inside wall of the container is plastic-coated.

An aerosol container filled with pharmaceutically active aerosols that are to be
administered in predetermined amounts and that are supplied in the container in the form

of a suspension, the suspension also comprising, in addition to a pharmaceutically active

substance, at least a propellant gas, which aerosol container has a metering valve that
comprises a metering chamber and a valve stem, the metering chamber being in communication

with the interior of the container and being full of a predetermined amount of the
aerosol in a first position of the valve stem, and releasing the amount of aerosol disposed

in the metering chamber in a second position of the valve stem, wherein the propellant gas
comprises only fluorohydrocarbons and, where appropriate, also cosolvents and/or

surfactants, and wherein the inner wall of the container is coated with a plastics coating of
polytetrafluoroethylene or perfluoroethylenepropylene.
An aerosol container according to claim 1, wherein the thickness of the container wall is
in the range from approximately 0.1 mm to approximately 2 mm, and is especially

approximately 0.4 mm, and the thickness of the plastics coating is in the range from
approximately 1 nm to approximately 1 mm, and is especially some 10 nm.
An aerosol container according to either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the volume of the
interior of the container is in the range from approximately 1 ml to approximately 100 ml

and the volume of the metering chamber is from approximately 5 µl to approximately
400 µl.
The use of an aerosol container according to any one of the preceding claims for the
storage and administration of a predetermined amount of a pharmaceutically active

aerosol in the form of a suspension.
The use according to claim 4, wherein the pharmaceutically active substance in the
suspension is an anti-asthmatically active substance or substance mixture.
The use according to claim 5, wherein the pharmaceutically active substance in the
suspension is Formoterol or a corticosteroid, especially 9α-chloro-6α-fluoro-11β,17α-dihydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxo-androsta-1,4-diene-17β-methoxycarbonyl-17-propionate,

or 
a mixture of Formoterol and that corticosteroid.
The use according to claim 5, wherein the pharmaceutically active substance is
(1R,2S)-(3E,5Z)-7-[1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1-hydroxy-10-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)-3,5-decadien-2-ylthio]
-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyrane-2-carboxylic
acid.
