<ABSTRACT>
A gas indicator (11) for a modified atmosphere food package 
(19) comprises a series of strips (12,13,14,15,16) which 

progressively change colour as the proportion of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere progressively changes in magnitude 

due to absorption of the carbon dioxide by the food product 
(17) over time. The indicator (11) thus is "tuned" to 

indicate changing atmospheric conditions inside a see-through 
envelope (10) and thus the condition of the product (17) can 

be monitored and any tampering with the package (19) is evident.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas indicator for a package and, more 
particularly, to a gas indicator for a package containing a food 
product in a modified atmosphere contained within the package. 
Generally, such packaging of food products is referred to as 
modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). In BE-A-822 378, WO-A-89/05761 and US-A-5,096,813 indicator 
systems are disclosed in which a sensor contained within a 
package changes colour if the package is tampered with and a gas 
enters into or escapes from the package. In BE-A-822 378 the 
system provides for the addition of a basic gas to a package 
before it is closed and a sensor contained within the package 
changes colour when the basic gas is released if the package is 
tampered with. In WO-A-89/05761 and US-A-5,096,813 the system 
disclosed includes a sensor contained within the package which 
changes colour if the package containing no oxygen is tampered 
with such that oxygen enters into the package. Although the systems disclosed in BE-A-822 378, WO-A-89/05761 and 
US-A-5,096,813 provide a gas indication within a package which 
changes colour when a gas enters in or passes from a package, the 
systems do not provide for an indication of any change of 
atmosphere within the package if it is not tampered with.  
 Furthermore, the system disclosed in BE-A-822 378 would not 
function for MAP because MAP does not involve the addition of a 
basic gas. The main gas used in MAP is carbon-dioxide, which is 
acidic. It is the acidity of carbon dioxide used in MAP that 
provides packaged food with a long shelf life. The addition of a 
basic gas will offset and ruin this effect. Similarly, the system disclosed in either WO-A-89/05761 or US-A-5,096,813 
would not be suitable for MAP in which the atmosphere 
contained in a package included oxygen. More importantly, 
however, the system is not suitable for MAP because it is not 
reversible and therefore does not provide the facility for 
indicating increase and decrease of the proportion of a gas in 
the atmosphere contained within a package. The system also would 
be difficult to process because of the short time available 
during which the sensor material could be exposed to air. 
Furthermore, the period stated in US-A-5,096,813 of one to eight 
hours for colour change of a gas sensor to take effect is much 
too slow for MAP where it is required that such colour change 
should be effective within seconds or minutes. Generally, in MAP an envelope containing a good product is 
flushed with a specific mixture

<CLAIMS>
A food package (19) comprising a sealed envelope (10) 
containing a food product (17), a predetermined ratio of 

gases and a plurality of indicators (12, 13, 14, 15 and 
16) characterised in that each of the indicators (12, 13, 

14, 15 and 16) is adapted to change colour at different 
predetermined ratios of the gases. 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that 
the indicators (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) are arranged to 

provide a colour graded series when activated. 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 
characterised in that the indicators (12, 13, 14, 15 and 

16) adapted to change colour are applied to an inner 
surface of the envelope (10). 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that 
the indicators (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) comprise a label.  

 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that 
the indicators (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16) comprise material 

printed on the said inner surface. 
A package (19) as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the indicators (12, 13, 14, 

15 and 16) are protected from the product (17) by means of 
a gas permeable membrane. 
A package (19) as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that one of said gases is carbon dioxide. 
A package (19) as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that one of said gases is oxygen. 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that 
one of said gases is carbon dioxide. 
A package (19) as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that 
one of said gases is oxygen.
