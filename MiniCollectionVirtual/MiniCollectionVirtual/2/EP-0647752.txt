<ABSTRACT>
It comprises means (9; 509) for keeping axially moveable elements (2, 4; 120, 140; 520, 540) in a first position, in which they cooperate in rotation (at A) with the rotor (2) by means of a bolt-carrying head (6; 106; 506); and means (B) for ensuring that the rotation of a bush assembly (4; 104; 504), fixed into rotation to the rotor by means of the tumblers (3) when a correct key is not inserted, causes the displacement of the moveable elements towards a second position, in which they free the bolt-carrying head from union with the rotor. When an attempt is made to open the lock with a tool or a false key, the tumbers fix the bush to the rotor, causing the latter to rotate, this rotation bringing about an axial movement for the disconnection of the lock and the rotor consequently rotating freely and not acting on the bolt. The axially moveable elements can be the said rotor and the bush or intermediate parts. The lock can also comprise means for preventing the lock from being forced by exerting a torque and a force for preventing axial displacement, and means for preventing the possibility of direct action on the bolt.

Disengageable lock for motor vehicles and the like, which
has:


a rotor (102, 202) provided with tumblers (3) and mounted so
as to be gyratory inside a stator (1);
a sleeve assembly (104, 204) interposed so as to be gyratcry
between the rotor and stator, the said sleeve assembly being

provided with recesses or grooves enabling the said tumblers
to pass, and the sleeve assembly being fixed to the rotor with

respect to rotation by means of the said tumblers if a correct
key is not inserted in the said lock,
and at least one element which is axially movable between
two positions, a first position in which it makes a bolt-carrier

head (106, 206) fixed to the rotor with respect to
rotation, and a second division in which it leaves the said

bolt-carrier head free with respect to the rotor;
elastic means (9) in order to keep the said at least one
axially movable element in the said first position in the

absence of any external actions on the lock;

in which the rotation of the sleeve assembly (104, 204) causes
the axial movement of the said at least one element from the

said first position to the said second position, so that, when
the rotor (102, 202) is caused to turn by inserting in the

lock an object other than the correct key, the tumblers (3) of
the rotor rotate the sleeve assembly, the latter causes the

axial movement of the said at least one element, the bolt-carrier
head (106, 206) becomes free from the rotor with

respect to rotation and remains at rest;

the said at least one axially movable element having a
transmission piece (120, 220) between the rotor (102, 202) and 

the bolt-carrier head (106, 206), fixed to the rotor with
respect to rotation, and a coupling piece (140, 240) between

the said transmission piece and the sleeve assembly (104,
204), this coupling piece being axially movable and having

means for driving the transmission piece in the said axial
movement between the first position and the second position,

the transmission piece becoming decoupled from the bolt-carrier
head as a result of this axial movement;

characterised in that the said coupling piece (140, 240) is
fixed to the sleeve assembly (104, 204) with respect to

rotation and has means (140b, 1b; 240b, 1b) for moving axially
when its rotation is brought about, and in that the said

coupling piece has at least one internal radial shoulder
(140g), housed in a complementary seat formed in the external

surface of the rotor, in order to re-establish the coupling
with respect to rotation between the rotor (102) and the bolt-carrier

head (106) in cases where, after the insertion in the
lock of an object other than the appropriate key, the sleeve

assembly (104), the coupling piece (140) and the transmission
piece (120) are not situated in the first position.
Disengageable lock according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the sleeve assembly (104; 204) is formed by two identical

half-sleeves, substantially semi-cylindrical in shape.
Disengageable lock according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the means for the axial movement of the

coupling piece when its rotation is brought about include at
least one longitudinal coupling (140b, 1b; 240b, 1b) of the

coupling piece with the stator, the walls of which are
inclined.
Disengageable lock according to Claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the transmission piece (120; 220)

cooperates with the bolt-carrier head (106; 206) through at
least one longitudinal coupling (A). 
Disengageable lock according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the union between the transmission piece

and the rotor consists of an axial projection (102h; 202h) on
the rotor, with a non-circular cross-section, coupled with a

complementary axial slot (120h; 220h) formed in the
transmission piece.
Disengageable lock according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the union between the coupling piece and

the sleeve consists of at least one longitudinal projection
(140f; 240f) on the coupling piece housed in a complementary

Disengageable lock according to Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the said means for the coupling piece to

drive the transmission piece in its axial movement include a
transverse shoulder (140i) formed by the coupling piece, which

is coupled with another complementary transverse shoulder
(120i) consisting of the transmission piece.
Disengageable lock according to Claims 1 to 6,

Disengageable lock according to Claim 8, characterised in
