Hydrocyclone, preferably with a slender, conical main part 
of the cyclone body with the outlet end of a heavy fraction at 

the apex of the truncated cone and with an immersion tube at the 
other end of the cyclone, which preferably has a cylindrical 

construction, for the discharge of a light fraction, which is 
essentially not gas, as well as with a distributor within the 

immersion tube for deflecting the flow within the latter for the 
purpose of recovering the pressure height, the distributor (5) 

being located at a minimum distance from the inlet end of the 
immersion tube (3) of half the inner diameter of the immersion 

tube (3); characterised in that the hydrocyclone comprises an 
additional gas outlet tube (6) located concentrically with 

respect to the immersion tube and within the latter and the 
distance of the distributor (5) from the inlet opening of the gas 

tube (6) amounts to at least one, preferably to at least 1.7 
times the inner diameter of the immersion tube. 
Hydrocyclone according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the radial extent (blade width) of the blades (7) of the 

distributor (5) amounts to 15-30% and in the case of the 
additional central gas tube (6) between 15 and 20% of the inner 

diameter of the immersion tube. 
Hydrocyclone according to one of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterised by a rounding of the inlet edge of the immersion 

tube (3) with a radius between 0.65 times and 0.9 times the wall 
thickness of the immersion tube (3). 
Hydrocyclone according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by a peripheral, rounded thickening (10) at the 

inlet edge of the immersion tube (3). 
Hydrocyclone according to Claim 4, characterised in that 

the thickening (10) is located at least partly inside the 
immersion tube (3).  

 
Hydrocyclone according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by a narrowing-down of the blade (7) reducing the 

blade width at the beginning (inlet end) of the blade (7) to a 
width of 0 over a length of the latter of up to 20% of the inner 

diameter of the immersion tube. 
Hydrocyclone according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the narrowing-down takes place in the form of a branch or a 

section of the branch of a parabola or hyperbola. 
Hydrocyclone according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the distributor comprises blades (7) having 

a simple curvature for the smooth impingement of the flow at the 
beginning (inlet region of the distributor 5) with a curvature 

or inclination decreasing in the downstream direction towards the 
radial planes of the cyclone passing through the blades, the 

curvature decreasing to a straight extent of the blade (7) at its 
outlet end and they lie with their outlet end in a corresponding 

radial plane of the hydrocyclone.
