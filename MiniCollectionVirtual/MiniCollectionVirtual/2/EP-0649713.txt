<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is a constituent part of a cutting appliance and comprises a U-shaped bracket frame with two parallel parts (3,4), between the free ends of which a cutting wire (11) is tensioned. In each case one guide device (14,15) is arranged on said parallel parts (3,4). The cutting appliance comprises a likewise U-shaped retaining frame (2) with two parallel parts (23,24), which each exhibit a groove for guiding the guide devices (14; 15) of the apparatus (1). An elongate support (28) is mounted pivotably at the free ends of the parallel parts (23,24) of the retaining frame (2). The cutting wire may be an oscillating saw wire or a heating wire.

Cutting unit for cutting pieces from soft material, comprising a stirrup (3, 4, 5), which is
guided so that it can be displaced in a parallel manner and which has two parallel stirrup

arms (3, 4) and a connecting strut (5), a cutting wire (11, 48) being tensioned between
the two free ends of the stirrup arms (3, 4), an
d comprising a frame-shaped holding
device with two parallel frame arms (23, 24), which are connected together at one end

by a part (25) which connects them and, at the other end, by an elongated load-carrying
member (28), a guide strip (38) for guiding the piece to be cut being fastened to the

load-carrying member (28), characterised in that the stirrup arms (3, 4) are each guided
by a guide device (14, 15) in guides (46, 47) of the frame arms (23, 24) and in that the

load-carrying member (28) is fastened to the frame arms (23, 24) so that it can be
pivoted about an axis parallel to the cutting wire (11, 48) and so that it can be arrested.
Cutting unit according to Claim 1, characterised in that the cutting wire (11; 48) is
extended by a connecting wire accommodated within the stirrup.
Cutting unit according to Claim 2, characterised in that the connecting wire is configured
as a driving wire (11'), in that the cutting wire (11) and the driving wire form a loop

and in that a driving appliance is present in order to transfer a mechanically oscillating
motion to the driving wire and therefore also to the cutting wire (11).
Cutting unit according to Claim 3, characterised in that the stirrup encompasses one
roller (8, 9) each in the end region of the stirrup arm (3, 4) and one roller (8', 9') each in

the region of two corner connections (6, 7) of the stirrup in order to keep the driving
wire tensioned.
Cutting unit according to Claim 2, characterised in that the cutting wire is a hot wire
(48) and the connecting wire is an electrical conductor through which an electric current

is supplied to the hot wire (48).
Cutting unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the cutting wire
(11) is a saw wire, which has at least one wire (58) which encompasses a main wire (60) 

which is wound around by at least one winding wire (59), or which encompasses at least
two entwined wires (61, 62; 62, 63).
Cutting unit according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a distance rod (37)
is present in order to fix the load-carrying member (28) in a pivoted position relative to

the parallel frame arm (23, 24) of the holding frame (2).
Cutting unit according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the load-carrying
member (28) has an elongated gap (35) into which the cutting wire (11; 48) can be

introduced at the end of the cutting path.
Cutting unit according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the guide strip (38)
is pivotably arranged on the load-carrying member (28).
