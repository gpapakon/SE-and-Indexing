<ABSTRACT>
This relates to a granular detergent composition containing (a) from about 0,00025 to about 0.015 grams of active enzyme per 100 grams of composition, of certain lipases, (b) from about 0.5 to about 10 wt.% of alkyl alkoxy sulfate or polyhydroxy fatty acid amide, and (c) from about 2 to about 30 wt.% of additional anionic or nonionic surfactant, wherein (a)/(b) is between about 0.09 and about 0.28, for improved performance after the first wash cycle. A method for cleaning fabrics is also provided.

 GRANULAR DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS WITH LIPASEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a granular detergent composition containing lipase produced by a lipase producing strain from the fungi Humicola sp. or Ther omvces sp., or the bacteria PseudoÏ€tonas Dseudoalcaliqenes or Pseudomonas fluorescens. A method of cleaning fabrics using such a composition is also included.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The inclusion of lipase in detergent compositions for improved cleaning performance is known. Examples are European Patent Application 0368 589, published May 16, 1990; U.S. Patents 4,707,291, Thorn et al , issued November 18, 1987, 4,769,173, Cornelissen et al issued September 6, 1988, 4,861,509, Cornelissen et al, issued August 29, 1989, 5,069,809, Lagerwaard et al, issued December 3,1991; and Japanese Publication 01161-096, published December 17, 1987.Unfortunately, although cleaning benefits from using granular laundry detergent compositions on stained or soiled laundry are clear after multiple laundry cycles, it has heretofore been difficult to see those benefits (particularly on grease and oil stains such as bacon grease and spaghetti sauce) after only one cycle in the washing machine and clothes drier. In fact, washing in granular detergents containing lipase at the conventional higher levels (in commercial products) often brings about a first cycle cleaning loss although there is a multi-cycle cleaning benefit. It has been found that, for the lipases shown below, keeping the amount of lipase low (i.e. at the level shown below), and including certain anionic or nonionic surfactants in a specified weight ratio in the granular detergent composition, will result in improvement in the removal of triglyceride-based stains or soils, such as greasy food stains and body soils, from fabrics even after the first laundry cycle. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a granular detergent composition comprising, by weight:(a) from about 0.00025 to about 0.015, preferably about 0.0025 to about 0.010, grams of active enzyme per 100 grams of composition, of lipase produced by a lipase producing strain of Humicola sp. or Thermomvces sp. or Pseudomonas pseudoalcalioenes or Pseudomonas fluorescens.:(b) from about 0.5 to about 10% of aikyl alkoxy sulfate and/or polyhydroxy fatty acid amide; and(c) from about 2 to about 30% of additional anionic or nonionic surfactant; wherein (a)/(b) is between about 0.09 and about 0.28.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe granular detergent compositions herein

3. A granular detergent composition according to Claim 1 or 2 comprising from 0.0025 to 0.010 grams of active enzyme per 100 grams of composition, of lipase produced by a lipase producing strain of Humicola lanuginosa or Pseudomonas oseudoalcaligenes.
4. A granular detergent composition according to any of the preceding claims comprising from 0.5 to 5 weight % of aikyl sulfate which has been ethoxylated with from 0.5 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of aikyl sulfate.
5. A granular detergent composition according to any of the preceding claims wherein the amount of lipase divided by the 


a ount of aikyl alkoxy sulfate or polyhydroxy fatty acid amide is between 0.10 and 0.20.
6. A granular detergent composition according to any of the preceding claims further comprising from 20 to 70 weight % of detergency builder selected from the group consisting of the salts of carbonate, silicate, sulfate, phosphate, aluminosilicate, and citric acid and mixtures thereof.
