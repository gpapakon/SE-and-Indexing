<ABSTRACT>
Gas generating apparatus comprises an electrochemical 
cell having gas generating (2) and counter electrodes (3) 

with an intervening body of electrolyte (9). Current 
passing between the electrodes causes the generation of gas 

at the gas generating electrode. A first membrane (24) 
permeable to gas but substantially impermeable to the 

electrolyte is positioned sufficiently close to the gas 
generating electrode (2) that gas generated by the gas 

generating electrode diffuses through the electrolyte and 
out through the membrane under the influence of a gas 

concentration gradient, substantially without forming 
bubbles in the electrolyte and irrespective of the 

orientation of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to gas generating apparatus 
comprising an electrochemical cell having gas generating 
and counter electrodes with an intervening body of 
electrolyte, whereby current passing between the electrodes 
causes the generation of gas at the gas generating 
electrode. Such apparatus is hereinafter referred to as of 
the kind described. Gas generating apparatus of the kind described finds 
particular use in calibration gas generators. These 
generators are used to produce a closely controlled 
concentration of a gas, such as chlorine, in a purge gas 
for use in calibrating gas sensors. A typical example is 
described in US-A-4460448. Another typical electrochemical calibration gas 
generator is produced by Bedfont Technical Instruments 
Limited, model EC3. In this generator, chlorine gas 
evolves at a generating electrode immersed in an acidic 
electrolyte solution of potassium chloride. Purge gas is 
bubbled through the electrolyte chamber, mixes with bubbles 
of chlorine gas and vents through the top of the apparatus. 
Hydrogen gas evolves at a counter electrode in a second arm 
of the electrolyte chamber and also vents through the top 
of the apparatus. A problem with this type of apparatus is that it may 
only be operated in one orientation since gas can only vent 
in one direction. Also, if the apparatus is inverted or 
otherwise tilted from its normal operation, electrolyte can 
leak out. For this reason, the generator is not 
particularly portable. DE-A-3013711 describes a generator 
which is designed to prevent electrolyte flooding during 
inadvertent inversion but this design does not ensure that 
the cell can operate in any orientation because there is no 
provision for the management of the bubbles which 
inevitably form during operation.  In accordance with the present invention, gas 
generating apparatus of the kind described further 
comprises a membrane permeable to gas but substantially 
impermeable to the electrolyte is positioned sufficiently 
close to the gas generating electrode that gas generated by 
the gas generating electrode diffuses through the 
electrolyte and out through the membrane under the 
influence of a gas concentration gradient, substantially 
without forming bubbles in the electrolyte and irrespective 
of the orientation of the apparatus, and wherein the 
electrochemical cell defines a generally U-shaped 
electrolyte chamber, the counter electrode extending into 
one of the arms of the U and the gas generating electrode 
being positioned at the base of
