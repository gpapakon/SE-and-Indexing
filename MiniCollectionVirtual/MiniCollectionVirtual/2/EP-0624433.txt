<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to pliers, in particular for circlips (securing rings), having two pliers halves (1,2) which are pivotably interconnected via a single joint and are in each case constructed at one end in the form of a handle and equipped at the other end with a functional element (4) constructed in accordance with the particular application. In order to develop pliers of the type described at the beginning such that they are less expensive to produce while at the same time having an insulating action and being lighter than the known pliers, it is proposed that the pliers halves (1,2) are made of plastic and the functional element (4) is moulded into the end of the pliers halves (1,2).

<CLAIMS>
Pliers, in particular for retaining rings, having
two pliers halves (1, 2), which are pivotably connected

to one another by means of a single reverse-action joint
(30) and in each case are formed into a handle at one end

and are provided at the other end with a functional
component (4) which is designed to match the respective

intended application, the single reverse-action joint
(30) being formed by a bearing pin (32), which is integrally

moulded on one pliers half (2), with a cylindrical
circumferential surface (33) and by a cylindrical bearing

opening (31), which is formed in the other pliers half
(1) and has an internal diameter which corresponds to the

external diameter of the bearing pin (32), and by a screw
(34), which is screwed into the bearing pin (32), characterized

in that the pliers halves (1, 2) consist of
homogeneous plastic material, in that the functional

component (4) is moulded into the plastic at the ends of
the pliers halves (1, 2), and in that the screw head (35)

of the screw (34) bears only against the outside, surrounding
the bearing opening (31), of the pliers half

(1).
Pliers according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a washer (36) is arranged between screw head (35)

and the outside, surrounding the bearing opening (31), of
the pliers half (1).
Pliers according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the pliers halves (1, 2) are produced from glass-fibre-reinforced

polyamide.
Pliers according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a recess (41) is formed on the functional component

(4), which recess is filled by solidified plastic.
Pliers according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the functional component (4) is coated

with hard material, e.g. with TiN, TiC, WC or BN.
Pliers according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that in each case one pin (5) for holding a

spring is formed on inwardly directed faces of the pliers
halves (1, 2).
