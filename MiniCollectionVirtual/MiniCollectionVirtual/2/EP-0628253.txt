<ABSTRACT>
Pickle stock having a cured appearance is obtained by 
immersing pickle stock in a curing liquid and then subjecting the 

immersed pickle stock to a vacuum having a pressure of 0 to 70 kPa 
and then to a pressure of greater than 170 kPa. The vacuum and 

pressure treatments are each carried out for an effective 
treatment time not exceeding one minute.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of
producing a pickle product having a cured appearance. More
particularly, the present invention is directed to a method for
producing a pickle product having a cured appearance without the
necessity of a traditional fermentation step. The expression
"cured" is herein used to include cured by fermentation as well as
having a cured appearance as a result of other not non-fermentation
processes.Cured pickle products are very popular with consumers all
over the world because they typically have a flavor and an
appearance that clearly distinguishes them from other types of
pickle products, such as "fresh pack".The traditional method of curing a pickle stock, such as
cucumbers, peppers or other vegetables, typically requires the
fermentation of the pickle stock. These traditional fermentation
processes require that the raw pickle stock be placed in a vat or
other suitable container containing a brine curing solution and
stored in this brine curing solution for a period of time
sufficient for fermentation to take place and produce a cured
product. Traditional fermentation processes can take from three
to four weeks to produce a cured product and require many large
storage tanks to accommodate a pickle stock crop such as
cucumbers. Tank yard operations in the traditional fermentation
processes involve a considerable amount of labor and capital
expenditure with respect to running and maintaining the tank yard.
Disposal of the spent brine raises additional problems since many
municipalities have ordinances regulating chloride discharge.
Manufacturers have attempted to reduce the amount of chloride
discharge by reducing the fermentation salt levels, recycling
spent pickling brine and attempting to prevent tank leakage.
However, these steps do not solve but merely delay the problem of
disposing of the large volumes of dilute salt brine generated.In addition to the problems discussed above, traditional
fermentation processes also suffer from factors which result in
inconsistent or poor quality product and loss of yield. These
factors include "softening" of the pickle stock; slow, no, or
wrong fermentation; bloating and other gaseous defects; physical
handling damage; incomplete curing appearance; and freeze damage 
in cold climates.In order to overcome the above-discussed problems, U.S.
Patent No. 4 844 929 discloses a one-step nonfermentative pickling
process in which a pickle stock is placed in a solution containing
pickling powders made up of acidulants, spices,

<CLAIMS>
A method of curing pickle stock wherein the pickle stock
is immersed in a curing liquid, and the immersed pickle stock is

subjected to a vacuum treatment step then to a pressure treatment
step characterised in that the vacuum and pressure treatment steps

are each for an effective treatment time not exceeding one minute.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the vacuum
treatment step is a vacuum having a pressure of between 0 and 70

kPa (i.e. between 0 and 7,000 kgm
-2
 absolute) and the pressure
treatment step is a pressure of greater than 170 kPa (17,500 kgm
-2

absolute).
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
curing liquid is substantially chloride free water.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
curing liquid is a brine solution.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the
curing liquid contains a sweetener.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the
curing liquid contains vinegar.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
pickle stock is cucumber.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
pickle stock has its outer skin broken before being subjected to

the vacuum.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
vacuum treatment step is repeated.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
pressure treatmen
t step is repeated.
