<ABSTRACT>
A phase locked loop frequency synthesizer in which the output frequency is changed in a series of steps in order to reach a final frequency value. The steps are computed and stored in a memory in a control unit. The steps are chosen to approximately cancel the poles of the transfer function of the synthesizer. The phase locked loop provides increased switching speed without adding extra components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to frequency
synthesizers of the type having a phase locked loop (PLL), and
more particularly, to an improved frequency synthesizer which
can quickly switch frequencies while maintaining suppression of
disturbances.A phase locked loop is a well known circuit which
typically includes a phase detector, a filter, and a voltage
controlled oscillator (VCO). A stable input signal or
reference signal is applied to the phase detector which
compares the input signal to the output of the voltage
controlled oscillator. The output signal of the phase detector
is representative of the phase difference between the input
signal and the output signal of the voltage controlled
oscillator. The output signal of the phase detector is
filtered. The filtered signal is then used as an error signal
to control the voltage controlled oscillator, thereby causing
the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator to track the
frequency of the stable input signal.It is well known to those skilled in the art to
generate different signals having a carefully determined
frequency fvco using a frequency synthesizer having a PLL 10 as
illustrated in Fig. 1. The PLL 10 includes a controllable
oscillator VCO 14 which is locked to a crystal source which
provides an input signal fxtal. The frequency of the VCO signal
fvco is typically divided by a controllable divider 15 having a
division number N to obtain a signal having a frequency fv. The signal fv is thereafter compared to the reference signal
fref which is derived from the division of the input signal fxtal
from the crystal frequency source by a frequency divider 11
having a division number R. The comparison of the signals
having frequencies fref and fv in the phase detector 12
generates the control or error signal E. The control signal E
is filtered by the filter 13 in order to remove signal
components emanating from the signals fref and fv respectively.
The filtered signal U controls the VCO 14 so that a balanced
condition is reached (fvco=fxtal x N , R). By choosing different
division numbers, N and R respectively, different frequencies
can be achieved with a relatively high degree of accuracy.In this type of frequency synthesizer, the frequency
can be changed by selecting the division numbers R and N.
After a new frequency has been selected, a certain time is
required to achieve a balanced condition. The amount of time
is usually dependent upon the filter 13. In many
implementations, it is necessary to quickly achieve a stable
output signal fvco.
