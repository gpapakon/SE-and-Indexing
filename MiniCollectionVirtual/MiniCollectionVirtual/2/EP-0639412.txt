<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating an elongate sealing cap for the 
juxtaposed and interconnected upstanding edge flanges of 

cladding panels comprises the steps of feeding an elongate 
strip of metal longitudinally through a succession of sets 

of forming rolls of predetermined individual peripheral 
configuration. The metal strip is shaped to turn the side 

edges of the strip to an inclined angle to the plane of the 
strip and is then deformed progressively in passing through 

a plurality of the sets of forming rolls finally into a 
U-shaped configuration in section, with the inclined side 

edges directed inwardly of U-shape at a final set of 
forming rolls. An elongate extruded flexible sealing 

member is fed into the partially deformed metal strip at an 
intermediate set of forming rolls, and thereafter the 

deformed metal strip is passed with the flexible sealing 
member contained therein through the remaining sets of 

forming rolls to the final set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cladding panel edge cap 
fabrication. More particularly the invention relates to a method of 
fabricating an elongate moisture resistant capping assembly 
for applying to cladding panel edges at the juxtaposition 
of building cladding panels. It is well known to provide cladding panels for the 
roofs and walls of buildings. Such panels frequently are 
of an elongate nature fitting on the wall or roof alongside 
each other, and proposals have been made for jointing 
together the juxtaposed edges of such panels, and for 
sealing the joints so that the total panel assembly is 
impervious to moisture. We have ourselves proposed a system for connecting and 
sealing the edges of juxtaposed panels wherein the panels 
have, along their juxtaposed edges, upstanding flanges, the 
upstanding flanges being physically secured together, and  
 
there being an elongate moisture resistant cap placed over 
the juxtaposed and interconnected upstanding flanges along 
the edges of the assembled panels. The cap we have previously proposed comprises 
essentially, in section, a metallic U-shaped member within 
which is located a U-shaped sealing gasket. It is commercially desirable to reduce the cost of 
such moisture resistant cap to as low a figure as possible, 
since a significant quantity of such elongate cap is 
required with respect to cladding panels for the connection 
therebetween. Since the cost of fabrication of the sealing 
cap is a most important factor in determining the cost of 
the cap, it is a desirable aim to provide an efficient, 
simple and effective way of fabricating the cap, and it is 
an object of the present invention to provide a method of 
fabrication which at least substantially meets this aim. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a method of fabricating an elongate sealing cap 
for the juxtaposed and interconnected upstanding edge 
flanges of cladding panels comprising the steps of feeding 
an elongate strip of metal longitudinally through a 
succession of sets of forming rolls of predetermined 
individual peripheral configuration in which, in 
succession, the metal strip is shaped to turn the side 
edges of the strip to an inclined angle to the plane of the 
strip and then deformed progressively in passing through a 
plurality of the sets of forming rolls finally into a 
U-shaped configuration in section, with the inclined side  
 
edges directed inwardly of the U-shape at a final set of 
forming rolls; feeding an elongate extruded flexible 
sealing

<CLAIMS>
A method of fabricating an elongate sealing cap for 
the juxtaposed and interconnected upstanding edge flanges 

of cladding panels, the method being characterised by the 
steps of feeding an elongate strip of metal longitudinally 

through a succession of sets of forming rolls of 
predetermined individual peripheral configuration in which, 

in succession, the metal strip is shaped to turn the side 
edges of the strip to an inclined angle to the plane of the 

strip and then deformed progressively in passing through a 
plurality of the sets of forming rolls finally into a 

U-shaped configuration in section, with the inclined side 
edges directed inwardly of the U-shape at a final set of 

forming rolls; feeding an elongate extruded flexible 
sealing member into the partially deformed metal strip at 

an intermediate set of forming rolls, and thereafter 
 

passing the deformed metal strip with the flexible sealing 
member contained therein through the remaining sets of 

forming rolls to the final set. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that 
the individual configuration of the sets of rolls is such 

that, after inclining the side edges of the metal strip, 
the strip is formed into an increasing sharp angled "V" 

section configuration and then into a "U" section 
configuration. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 
characterised in that the flexible elongate sealing member 

is provided with a section on extrusion of an approximate 
open "V" shape to aid its insertion into the partially 

formed U-shaped strip during fabrication of the cap. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the flexible sealing member is formed 

of an elastomeric sealing material. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that 
the elastomeric sealing material is a vinyl rubber. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the metal strip is formed of steel. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6 
 

characterised in that the flexible sealing member is 
positively fed into the partially formed cap member at the 

relevant set of forming rolls by the periphery of a 
friction wheel which engages the sealing member. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the extruded flexible sealing member 

is fed to the roll forming machine from a drum thereof. 
A method as claimed in Claim 8 characterised in that 
the strip is fed from a coil. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that the fabricated sealing cap is cut to 

predetermined stock lengths on leaving the final set of 
forming rolls.
