<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion
containing liposomes. More specifically, the present invention
relates to an aqueous dispersion containing liposomes containing a
hydroxy acid and an amino acid as stabilizing agents.Liposomes are vesicles composed of lipid bilayer membranes and
their applications have recently been developed in various fields
such as drug delivery systems, diagnostic drugs, artificial enzyme
carriers, sensors and cosmetics. In particular, liposomes
encapsulating drugs have been actively developed for the purposes of
stabilization of unstable drugs, slow release of drugs in living
bodies and targeting of drugs to lesion sites. However, liposomes
themselves are often unstable to heat and it has been known that, even
though they are prepared as a suspension, they relatively rapidly
exhibit aggregation or fusion with one another as well as
precipitation and coloration. Thus, in view of the above the commercialization
of liposome formulations is problematic.Hitherto, some studies have been conducted to improve the
storage stability of liposomes. However, many of them mainly aimed at
repressing the aggregation of liposomes, preventing the precipitation
of liposomes and preventing the leak of encapsulated materials, and
much attention has not been paid to the change of apparent color,
i.e., the coloration, which can be very easily recognized upon their
practical use. This coloring phenomenon has been known to be caused 
by the degradation products which are due to the peroxidation
degradation of phospholipids generally used as lipids for forming
liposomes. As a solution of this problem, there have been proposed
liposome formulations where vitamin E is added to the lipids for
forming liposomes (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No.
2-295917). However, vitamin E itself is very unstable to heat, light
and oxygen and has a problem of giving rise to a color change
due to its degradation.On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(KOKAI) No. 62-42733 discloses that liposomes were prepared by using
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, a synthetic phospholipid, as a lipid
for forming liposomes and specific hydrating agents and sterilized by
heat and these liposomes were stable without change of color after
one year storage at room temperature. However, the stabilizing effect
of the hydrating agents on liposomes prepared by using yolk lecithin
or soybean lecithin was not described or suggested at all. Moreover,
the liposomes composed of synthetic phospholipids
