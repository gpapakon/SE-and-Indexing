<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a cured composite, and a process for producing 
the cured composite. One embodiment of the invention particularly relates to 
a process for producing a light pipe ("FLP") having flexibility. The invention 
also relates to efficiently fabricating an FLP which is useful for conveying 
visible light, and which remains flexible and transparent under a wide range of 
use conditions. The production of a cured composite is known from EP-A-469 673, in 
which a continuous object of thermoset polymer is made by continuous 
polymerization, utilizing ultraviolet radiation to polymerize monomer in a 
clad. This production method teaches the use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation to 
obtain polymerization within a few seconds. Problems with this method 
include: 1) reduction of light transmittance and increased yellowness in 
thermoset polymers due to use of UV initiators, 2) requirement of fast 
polymerization such as within a few seconds by UV radiation, to avoid 
shrinkage of the thermoset polymer within the clad after the clad has 
solidified, and 3) the teaching away from thermal cure by heat. Further, this 
reference does not disclose a light pipe having flexibility and optical properties 
such as low light transmission loss. The range of applications to which a visible light-conveying light pipe 
can be applied are dictated by the physical and optical characteristics the FLP 
develops during the fabrication process. For example, US-A-4,708,833 
discloses a method for producing an elastomeric optical fibre by allowing a 
strand of polymer styrup to fall and simultaneously be crosslinked ("curing") 
by ultraviolet light, electron beam, or heat, thus curing the polymer syrup 
(elastomeric core) and achieving structural integrity, and then simultaneously 
or subsequently applying a cladding. Production methods using such rapid 
curing of the core suffer from several disadvantages: 1) limited breadth of 
available curing chemistry, 2) increased production rates require a 
proportional increase in cure rate or distance to a take-up roller, and 3) 
reduced light transmittance of the light pipe, particularly in the blue portion of 
the visible spectrum (i.e. increased yellowness) from use of curing materials 
that degrade or yellow upon heating or irradiation. US-A-4,957,347 ("347") teaches a flexible, clad monofilament production 
method which fills a pre-formed cladding tube with monomer, and then cures 
the monomer within the filled cladding. Such monomer-fill processes have 
advantages in
