<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a channel system with a cross-section with rounded corners, comprising various elements, such as straight, branch, corner, reducing fittings and/or the like. The elements have planar (1) and arched (2), such as convex, concave or corresponding wall parts, and which elements are manufactured of a material preferably with thin walls, such as sheet metal, plastic or the like. For achieving a cross-section with rounded corners, the elements of the channel system are formed by using joining arrangements to connect at least arched wall parts (2) with each other, preferably substantially the edges thereof, wherein the elements connected with each other form a flow or wiring channel or the like. The elements of the channel system, having different sizes and/or shapes, are formed by combining basic parts (1a, 1a', 2a, 2b, 2c) forming planar (1) and arched (2) wall parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a channel system with a 
cross-section with rounded corners, comprising various 
elements, such as straight, branch, corner, reducing 
fittings and/or the like with planar and arched, such 
as convex, concave or corresponding walls, and which 
elements are manufactured of a material preferably 
with thin walls, such as sheet metal, plastic or the 
like. For achieving a cross-section with rounded 
corners, at least part of the elements of the channel 
system are formed by using joining arrangements to 
connect at least arched wall parts with each other, 
preferably substantially the edges thereof, wherein 
the elements connected with each other form a flow or 
wiring channel or the like. Particularly as flow channels, channels with a cross-section 
with rounded corners are more advantageous 
for flowing than acute-angled, e.g. rectangular or 
quadratic channels. In a channel with acute angles, 
the flow is naturally not evenly distributed onto all 
parts of the wall, as compared with a channel with 
rounded corners, and turbulence is induced by acute 
angles. Thus for example in ordinary ventilation 
systems, impurities are gradually accumulated in the 
ducts. Commonly used channels with rounded corners are spiral 
tubes which are manufactured for each standardized 
tube size. In a channel system made of spiral tubes, 
the various branch, corner, reducing and corresponding 
fittings are manufactured by applying ordinary sheet 
working techniques. Thus the manufacture of the said 
elements requires good professional skills and/or 
specially tailored equipment, such as moulds, templates  
 
or the like. For reasons of manufacturing techniques, 
it is usually necessary to provide certain elements 
of a channel system having a cross-section with 
otherwise rounded corners with partly sharp edges, 
whereby it is not possible to maintain the advantageous 
cross-section with rounded corners in all parts. 
Naturally, for different elements needed for each 
tube size, tools for each size must be used. In 
practice, such channel systems made of spiral tubes 
usually have a clumsy general appearance due to 
elements manufactured with most various techniques 
and skills. The publications GB-1,301,858 and GB-1,552,916 disclose 
elements formed by planar parts joined together, 
applicable for use in a channel system with a cross-section 
with sharp edges. GB-1,301,858 presents a 
fireproof channel element, the wall being formed by 
flat plates joined together by corrosion-resistant 
connecting

A modular channel system for forming a flow or 
wiring channel or the like having a cross-section with 

rounded corners, comprising basic channel elements of different 
sizes defining straight, or branched, or cornered, or 

reducing fittings, said basic channel elements comprising at 
least one planar wall (1) and at least one arched (2) wall, 

made preferably of thin material, whereby for achieving 
a cross-section with rounded corners, the basic channel elements of 

the channel system are formed by combining together 
basic parts, substantially the edges thereof, by 

joining arrangements, to form wall parts with planar 
(1) and arched (2) shapes, wherein at least one planar 

wall part (1) of a basic channel element in the channel system is 
formed of a first basic part (1a, 1a'), defining a 

substantially flat sheet, and at least one arched wall 
part (2) of the same basic channel element is formed by a second basic 

part (2a) which extends in a longitudinal direction (s) of the channel 
and is arched transversely with respect to said 

longitudinal direction, at least one longitudinal 
edge of said second basic part being attached to the 

first basic part (1a),
 
   characterized in that said channel system is 

configurable to form a basic channel element comprised of: 

at least one first basic part (1a;1a') 
at least one second basic part (2a); 
a third basic part (2b) joining two longitudinal 
directions (s1, s2) in an arch and configured in a 

transverse direction at least partly in an arch, the 
third basic part (2b) being connected between first and 

second substantially longitudinal edges thereof, at 
least at its first substantially longitudinal edge to a 

second basic part (2a) of said basic channel element, or to another third basic part 
(2b) and at its second subs
tantially longitudinal edge 
to a first basic part (1a') of said basic channel element; and  

 
a fourth basic part (2c) configured to be 
continuously arched and connected at least at one of 

its edges to a second basic part (2a), a third basic 
part (2b) and/or another fourth basic part (2c). 
The modular channel system according to claim 1, 
wherein the arches of at least the edges to be

using a substantially equal radius (R) of curvature. 
The modular channel system according to claim 1

wherein the second edge of a third basic part 
(2b) to be joined with a first basic part (1a') is 

configured to join the plane (t) defined by the first 
basic part (la') in an arch, whereby the said edge is 

formed by two flat edge parts in angles deviating from 
each other in the said plane (t).
