<ABSTRACT>
A papermaking apparatus that can form a paper web having a 
good fiber formation is disclosed. A plurality of vertically 

adjustable forming rolls (2) are provided on the top surface of 
an endless felt couch (5) between a lead-in roll (10) and a couch 

roll (11), and stationary forming bars (3a) are provided on the 
bottom surface of a wire screen (4). The endless felt couch and 

the wire screen, between which paper stock is interposed, are 
caused to move by undulation to generate pulses, which in turn 

apply shear force onto the paper web to dewater the paper web 
while facilitating fiber dispersion on the paper web.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a papermaking apparatus, 
and more particularly to a papermaking apparatus that can 
manufacture paper having good fiver texture. This invention also 
relates to a multi-layer paper forming apparatus having a 
plurality of such papermaking apparatuses. A conventional type of papermaking apparatus basically 
comprises a flow box 32 for feeding paper stock to the wire-screen 
cylinder 31, a wire-screen cylinder 31 for dewatering the 
paper stock, and a couch roll 33 for forcing an endless felt 
couch 34 onto the wire-screen cylinder 31 to transfer a wet paper 
web to the bottom surface of the endless felt couch 34 to feed 
to the succeeding process, as shown in Fig.1. In such a conventional type of papermaking apparatus, the 
paper stock injected from the flow box 32 is dewatered by the 
wire-screen cylinder 31 , and then the endless felt couch 34 is 
forced onto the wire-screen cylinder 31 by the couch roll 33. 
As pulses are generated by the pressure of the couch roll 33 
exerted onto the endless felt couch 34, shear force is applied 
to dewater the paper stock, with the water draining inside the 
wire-screen cylinder 31 . As a result, a wet paper web is 
produced and transferred to the bottom surface of the endless 
felt couch 34. In the conventional type of papermaking apparatus, when  
 
paper stock is fed from the flow box 32 to the wire-screen 
cylinder 31, a fiber texture of paper is already formed but only 
to an insufficient degree. The fiber texture is therefore 
modified later by the shear force based on pulses caused by the 
pushing force of the couch roll 33. The aforementioned conventional type of papermaking 
apparatus has the following problems. 
(1)The number of pulses is few because pulses are generated 
at only one location. Consequently, the fiber texture formed by 
the flow box 32 is not adequately modified, and a good texture 
cannot be obtained. (2) At higher speeds, the wet paper web tends to disintegrate 
at the contact area of the couch roll 33, making it impossible 
to increase the amount of deposition of the wet paper web per 
wire-screen cylinder, and accordingly the amount of paper stock 
to be fed. As a result, it is difficult to form a thick paper 
web. It is an object of this invention to provide a papermaking 
apparatus that can form a paper web having a good fiber texture. It is another object of this invention to provide a multi-layer 
paper forming apparatus that can form multi-layer paper 
having a good fiber texture. The

A papermaking apparatus comprising; 
   a wire screen (4) circulating over a path, including a 

horizontal part, between a first roll (6) and a second roll (7), 
   an endless felt couch (5) circulating along the top surface 

of the horizontal part of said wire screen at the same speed as 
the speed of said wire screen, 

   a flow box (1) for feeding paper stock from the side of said 
first roll in between sid wire screen and said endless felt couch 

in said horizontal part, 
   a pulse inducing means (2, 3a, 3b) provided between said 

first and second rolls for applying pulses to said paper stock 
at plurality of locations by causing said wire screen and said 

endless felt couch, between which said paper stock is interposed, 
to move by undulation to dewater said paper stock while 

facilitating fiber dispersion on said paper stock to form a wet 
paper web, and 

   a couch roll (11) for transferring a wet paper web on said 
wire screen to said endless felt couch by forcing said wire 

screen and said endless felt couch that has cleared said pulse 
inducing means onto said second roll. 
A papermaking apparatus in which said pulse inducing 
means comprises a plurality of forming rolls (2) provided at a 

predetermined spacing on the top surface of said endless felt 
couch, and a plurality of forming bars (3a) provided at a 

predetermined spacing on the bottom surface of said wire screen; 
said forming rolls being disposed between each of said forming 

bars, and said forming rolls and said forming bars being 
adjustable for the respective vertical relative positions thereof 

 
so that said wire screen and said endless felt couch, between 

which paper stock is interposed, travel by undulation between 
said forming rolls and said forming bars. 
A papermaking apparatus in which said pulse inducing 
means comprises a plurality of forming rolls (2) provided at a 

predetermined spacing on the top surface of said endless felt 
couch, and a plurality of table rolls (3b) provided at a 

predetermined spacing on the bottom surface of said wire screen; 
said forming rolls being disposed between each of said table 

rolls, and said forming rolls and said table rolls being 
adjustable for the respective vertical relative positions thereof 

so that said wire screen and said endless felt couch, between 
which paper stock is interposed, travel by undulation between 

said forming rolls and said table rolls. 
A papermaking apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 where in 
said forming bars are stationary, and said forming rolls are 

supported in such a manner that said forming rolls are vertically 
movable in combination or singly. 
A papermaking apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 wherein 
said table rolls are stationary, and said forming rolls are 

supported in such a manner that said forming rolls are vertically 
movable
 in combination or singly. 
A papermaking apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 where in 
said forming bars and said forming rolls are supported in such 

a manner that said forming bars and said forming rolls are 
vertically movable in combination or singly.
