<DESCRIPTION>
 RAIL-GRINDING VEHICLETECHNICAL FIELD The subject invention concerns a method of grinding rails and a rail grinding vehicle designed to perform the method, according to which a grinding disc is formed with a rotational shaft extending essentially transversely to the longitudinal direction of the rail and the distance of the grinding disc to the rail is adjustable by means of actuating means in addition to which the grinding disc is affected by at least one sharpening tool.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION That the rails on which trams and trains travel are exposed to wear, is a well-known fact. The wear is due to a number of various factors, and the degree of such wear may vary considerably along e.g. one and the same tram line. The wear leads to a certain unevenness or undulation of the rail including troughs and peaks. In a tram rail the distance separating neighbouring peaks may be in the order of one to a couple of decimeters. This undulatory or grooved condition of the rail obviously causes wheel vibrations which are transmitted to the vehicle itself, with resulting impaired comfort. For this reason, the rail is ground from time to time in order to lessen these problems.Known types of rail grinding vehicles do not include a system for automatic evaluation of the rail quality. Instead, such evaluation is effected by ocular inspection or on the basis of notes made on board one tram carriage. This procedure might mean that the entire rail between two stops is ground when in actual fact it might only have been necessary to grind some 10 or 20 meters. In one known type of grinding vehicle a large number of rotating horizontal grinding cups having a diameter of approxi¬ mately 100 mm are used. The grinding capacity of such cups 

is very limited and consequently the grinding operations take very long while at the same time the grinding vehicle itself is very complex and expensive because each individual cup must be driven. One prior-art grinding vehicle uses a large rotating grinding disc. The rotational shaft of the grinding disc extends transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the rail, and the action of the disc is against the rail in the manner of a spinning wheel. The grinding disc is sharpened by a sharpening tool to the desired profile configuration so that in the grinding operation it imparts the desired profile configuration also to the rail. The cutting or removal capacity of this type of grinding device is quite superior and consequently its productivity is higher. But since the
