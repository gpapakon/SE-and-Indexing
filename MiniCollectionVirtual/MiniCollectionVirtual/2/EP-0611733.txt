<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20) for coating a glass ribbon (22) has an 
exhaust (26,28) on each side of a coating unit at different distances 

therefrom. With this arrangement, portions of the ribbon 
upstream and downstream of the coating unit are exposed to 

coating vapors from the coating unit for different periods of 
time. A coating mixture includes tin containing precursors 

and a silicon containing precursor. The silicon containing 
precursor has the structural formula 


 
where R
1
 is a group which does not have an oxygen available to 
form a peroxide, R
2
 is a functional group giving the silicon 
containing precursor the ability to be easily converted to 

silicon oxide coating, R
3
 is a bridging group to provide for 
multiple silicon atoms and R
4
 completes the bonding on the 
foundation silicon atom. An accelerant e.g. a phosphorus 

containing precursor may be used with the metal containing 
precursors to increase the deposition rate of the coating. 

The coating deposited on the glass has regions of continuously 
varying weight percent of silicon oxide and tin oxide as the 

distance from the glass-coating interface increases, with the 
surface of the coating farthest from the glass-coating 

interface being predominantly tin oxide. The regions within 
the coating provide the coating with different indices of 

refraction to eliminate iridescence resulting from increased 
thickness of the tin oxide at the outer coating surface and to 

provide the coated glass article with a neutral color. When 
phosphorus is used as the accelerant, the percent of 

crystallinity is reduced and approaches 0, thereby reducing or 
eliminating the coating haze.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for the chemical vapor deposition of one or more
different metal oxides on a substrate e.g. glass, to silicon containing
precursors used in the preparation of coating compositions
containing silicon oxide and to the product(s) e.g. coated
glass made thereby.It is known in the art that when a film of a
transparent metal oxide, such as tin oxide, is deposited on a
glass substrate, the coated glass substrate has non-uniform
light-reflection across the visible spectrum because of the
difference in the refractive index between the metal oxide and
the glass substrate. In addition, when the thickness of the
metal oxide coating is not uniform, the coating tends to
display a multiplicity of interference color effects commonly
referred to as iridescence. Such iridescence effects render
the coated glass aesthetically unacceptable for most
architectural applications. Thus, various methods to mask
such iridescence effects and/or reduce reflectance have been
proposed.One technique for minimizing or eliminating the
difference of the refractive index between a metal oxide and a
glass substrate is disclosed in U S -A- 3,378,396 to
Zaromb wherein a glass substrate is coated by simultaneously
directing separate sprays of a tin chloride solution and of a
silicon chloride solution onto a stationary heated glass piece
in an oxidizing atmosphere e.g. air. The heat of the glass
piece thermally converts the metal chlorides to their metal
oxides. The ratio of the sprays to each other are gradually
varied to vary the ratio of the weight percent of the metal
oxides in the coating. The resultant coating has a
continuously-changing composition throughout its thickness,
e.g. near the glass-coating interface, the coating is
predominantly silicon oxide, the surface of the coating'
furthest from the glass-coating interface is predominantly tin
oxide and there-between the coating is made up of varying
weight percent amounts of silicon oxide and tin oxide. Strong
in his publication entitled "Practical Applications of High
and Low-Reflecting Films on Glass", pages 441-443 of Le
Journal de Physique et Le Radium, Vol. 11, July 1950, teaches
that a coating technique similar to that taught by Zaromb
reduces the iridescence of the coated article.Additional techniques using the Zaromb teachings to
coat a moving substrate are taught in U S - A (S)-4,206,252
and 4,440,882. These patents further teach the
depositing of a second coating composed of fluorine-doped tin
oxide on the first coating
