<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for rendering acrylic 
based negative photoresists resistant to hot alkaline 

permanganate etchant and the iron chloride etchant and for 
improving the adhesion of the photoresist to the substrate, 

yet does not require halogenated reagents to develop or strip 
the photoresist. It has been discovered that the degradation 

of acrylic based negative photoresists by the permanganate 
etchant may be overcome by exposing an imaged acrylic based 

negative photoresist to select wavelengths of actinic 
radiation either ultraviolet light that is rich in deep UV, 

about 254 nm wavelength; or infrared radiation from about 2.4 

to about 8 microns. Where UV radiation is used, the 
photoresist is then baked to reduce undercutting of the 

photoresist. Thereafter, the photoresist is stripped using 
nonhalocarbon solvents.

<DESCRIPTION>
Conventionally in the manufacturing of metalized ceramic 
substrates for use as chip carriers, a negative photoresist 
subtractive circuitization process is employed. The 
metalization layer is typically a trilayer composed of a 100 
nm (1000 angstrom) thick chromium layer, a 5-20 micron thick 
copper layer, and about a 100 nm (1000 angstrom) chromium 
layer which is disposed on a ceramic substrate. A negative 
photoresist, typically a polyisoprene cyclized rubber 
photoresist such as KTFR manufactured by Shipley Corporation, 
is applied atop the metalization, exposed, and developed to 
produce an image. The image is used for subtractive 
circuitization, in which the trilayer is etched in 
conveyorized etching equipment to form the surface 
circuitization; the metal that is not protected by photoresist 
is removed. First, a 45°C alkaline permanganate etchant is 
employed to selectively remove the top layer of chromium. 
Next, the copper layer is selectively removed by an iron 
chloride etchant. Next, the bottom layer of chromium is 
selectively removed by etching a second time with the 45°C 
alkaline permanganate etchant. After the etching is 
completed, the photoresist is stripped leaving a metalized 
pattern on the ceramic substrate. Portions of the remaining 
metalization may be removed, using similar procedures, during 
subsequent manufacturing steps. The KTFR is a negative photoresist so it is not subject to the 
narrow processing windows to which positive photoresists are 
subject. Additionally, the KTFR photoresist can withstand 
high temperatures and can withstand both the iron chloride  
 
etchant and hot alkaline permanganate etchants. However, the 
KTFR photoresist requires halocarbon solvents, such as methyl 
chloroform (MCF) and Freon® to develop and strip the 
photoresist. Governmental regulations require that the use of 
such halocarbon solvents be eliminated within the next few 
years. Acrylic based negative photoresists can withstand high 
temperatures and do not require MCF or Freon® for development. 
However, they demonstrate poor resistance to the 45°C alkaline 
potassium permanganate etchant. Imaged acrylic based negative 
photoresist degrade within about 15 seconds after coming into 
contact with the hot permanganate etchant. Also, such acrylic 
based negative photoresists are frequently undercut by the hot 
permanganate etchant. It is desirable to have acrylic based negative photoresist 
that: can withstand both the iron chloride etchant and the 
hot alkaline permanganate etchant
