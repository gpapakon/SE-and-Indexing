<ABSTRACT>
A fluid delivery system for aspirating liquid 
from a bottle (40) and conveying the liquid 

to an analytical instrument while allowing ambient air or gas to enter the bottle to relace 
the aspirated liquid. The bottle opening is sealed 

by a valve (50). A tube (61) extends from the 
valve to the liquid within the bottle. A coupling component 

(54) is removably connected to 
the analytical instrument and to the valve for operatively connecting the instrument to the 

tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a system for dispensing liquid from a
container, such as a bottle. The invention is specifically directed to a system for
aspirating liquid reagent from a container for use in analytical instruments. A preferred
reagent bottle of the type described by the present invention includes an opening which
is closed by a valve. A fluidic coupling component provides a fluidic connection between
the valve and the analytical instrument. The analytical instrument includes a manifold
to which the coupling is connected and means for creating suction at the manifold. The
reagent is selectively drawn from its container by the analytical instrument as needed in
accordance with predetermined testing procedures. As reagent is drawn from the bottle,
air or gas must be introduced or vented into the bottle to replace the reagent. However,
the bottle must be sealed with respect to liquid and gas when reagent is not being drawn,
i.e. when the bottle is not attached to the instrument. A liquid seal must also be
maintained during drawing of reagent from the bottle to prevent leakage of reagent to the
outside of the bottle, i.e. when the bottle is attached to the instrument.Known systems for delivery of liquids such as reagent which make use of needles
or other fluid couplings or bayonet-like plungers have been less than satisfactory with
respect to sealing of the bottle during and between drawing of fluid from the bottle.Creating an effective fluid seal at the point where the coupling component is
connected to the analytical instrument is a necessary consideration.Leaking around the cap of the bottle is another problem. Leaking is likely to
occur if the cap is tightened too loosely following the filling of the bottle.The process of replacing an empty reagent bottle with a full bottle remains a 
difficult and time-consuming step with some prior art systems. Care must be exercised to
insure that all of the components of the system are properly connected to insure feeding of
reagent from the bottle to the analytical instrument to insure proper sealing between
interconnected components to prevent leaking of reagent from the system.A liquid delivery system is shown in US patent No. 4,854,486, issued 8 August 1989
to Daley et al. The delivery system in the Daley patent includes a valve assembly for a
container which has a bottom opening. A vent tube extends from the valve assembly to the
top of the container. The delivery system also includes a probe which has a liquid
passageway and a gas
