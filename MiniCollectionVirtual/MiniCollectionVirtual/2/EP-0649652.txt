<ABSTRACT>
Minimal-dose beta-blocker preparations are used for the short-term therapy of transient functional cardiovascular symptoms and produce in the body only those concentrations of active ingredient which do not produce any significant changes in the physiological values in the cardiovascular system under resting conditions for the specific beta-blocker used in each case and significantly reduce adrenergically induced transient stimulation effects, these being oral, transdermal or topical preparations. This makes differential therapy of functional symptoms possible, which does not apply to conventional beta-blocker preparations designed for long-term therapies. This results in an improvement both in the quality of life and in the benefits/risk ratio of the beta-blockers. The duration of therapy also need not be extended beyond the extent necessary for the symptoms because there is no risk of rebound after discontinuation. Thus, another and novel indication made possible is short-term use for primary therapy of sleep disturbances associated with autonomic syndromes, especially also associated with postmenopausal symptoms.

Use of a composition for the production of a
medicament for a short-term therapy of transient

functional cardiovascular symptoms with beta-blockers,
the composition being present in oral pharmaceutical

form with a hydrophilic beta-blocker, which, for the
specific beta-blocker employed in each case in the

body, only produces those active compound
concentrations having threshold activity with which

transient adrenergic stimulation effects can be
effectively clinically decreased without clinically

effective alterations of the cardiovascular values
being produced under resting conditions, the

pharmaceutical form being administered as a single dose
at dose intervals of 24 - 52 h in amounts of 10% to 50%

of the currently employed lowest oral therapeutic
single dose of the specific beta-blocker which is given

during use thereof in chronic therapies, with the
proviso that a short-term therapy of ventricular

tachycardias in connection with ventricular arrhythmias
is excluded.
Use according to Claim 1 for the treatment of
sleep disorders in the context of functional syndromes,

which in particular also includes use in sleep
disorders in the course of post-menopausal

symptomatologies.
Use according to Claim 1, the pharmaceutical
forms being employed in those packs which are intended

to achieve threshold beta-blocker concentrations for
the treatment of vegetative symptomatologies, in 

particular also with the absorption and design features
of single doses which in each case cause a therapeutic

effect for a number of days.
Use according to Claim 1, the hydrophilic beta-blocker
employed being atenolol, nadolol or sotalol.
