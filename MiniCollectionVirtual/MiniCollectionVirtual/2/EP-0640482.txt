<ABSTRACT>
An ink cartridge (1) includes a negative pressure 
producing material (3); an accommodating portion (4) for 

accommodating the negative pressure producing 
material, the accommodati
ng portion is provided with 
an opening (2) for receiving an ink supply tube (7) of an ink 

jet recording head; wherein the material is 
sandwiched between surfaces in the accommodating 

portion, and a distance between the surfaces smaller 
than twice an outer diameter of the ink supply tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
cartridge
arrangement according to the preamble of claim 1
for containing ink to be ejected
through a recording head.An ink jet recording system is known
e.g. from EP-A-0 424 133
to
effect recording on a recording material such as
paper, OHP sheet. The ink jet recording system is
such that the ink is ejected to the recording material
from a recording head, and therefore, the running cost
is low and the noise produced is low.Recently, a type of ink jet recording system
in which a recording head and an ink container are
carried on a carriage and are scanningly moved, is
particularly noted from the standpoint of downsizing
of the apparatus.Furthermore, in consideration of the fact
that the service life of the recording head is longer
than the service life of the ink container, the ink
container is made separable from the recording head.Referring to Figure 1, such an exchangeable
ink container is illustrated.An outer wall of an ink container 11 is
provided with an ink supply port 13 for permitting
supply of the ink to the recording head 12. By 
connecting an ink supply pipe 14 of a recording head
12 to the ink supply port 13, the supply of the ink is
permitted from the ink container to the recording head
12.Designated by a reference numeral 17 is an
air vent to function to introduce the air into the ink
container upon ink supply. The ink container 11, an
ink retaining member 15 is provided. By the proper
ink retaining force of the retaining member 15, the
ink is prevented from leaking through the recording
head 12, and proper ink supply to the recording head
12 is assured. As for the ink retaining member 15,
cotton like fibers or porous materials having
continuous pores, are usable. Particularly, sponge
material of polyurethane foam or the like is widely
used because the ink retaining force can be easily
adjusted.In an ink jet cartridge having an integral
recording head and ink container, an ink supply pipe
of the recording head is fixedly mounted relative to
the ink retaining member or a vacuum generating member
in the ink container under a predetermined pressure of
contact. By doing so, the vacuum producing member is
maintained at a predetermined compressed state so that
the air introduction at the contact portion is
prevented. In addition, the vacuum producing material
is compressed to increase the capillary force toward 
the supply pipe, and therefore, the adjacent ink can
be concentrated to the supply pipe. The situation is
different in an ink cartridge which is
