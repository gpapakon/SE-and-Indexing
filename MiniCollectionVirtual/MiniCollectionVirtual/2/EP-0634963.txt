<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method according to the preamble of claim 1. To achieve higher performance from turbine engines, manufacturers have designed 
various parts to operate at higher temperatures. Although these parts are often made from 
superalloys that can tolerate high temperatures, cooling is critical to reliable operation. 
Various superalloys, including alloys of Ni and Ti, are well known in the aerospace industry. 
Turbine blades are one example of superalloy parts that require cooling. Typically, turbine 
blades have internal cooling passages that permit cooling air to flow though them. The internal cooling passages in a turbine blade are formed by casting the blade 
around a ceramic core that can comprise Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2. The ceramic core is the 
pattern for the cooling passages. After the blade is cast, the ceramic core is leached out of 
the blade, leaving a hollow space inside the blade in the form of the cooling passages. The 
ceramic core is typically leached out of the blade with an aqueous solution of KOH. Occasionally, parts of the ceramic core are not removed during the leaching step. 
Because even small parts of the core can block the cooling passages or cause other damage, 
none of the core can be left inside the turbine blades. Therefore, the blades must be 
inspected to ensure that the core was completely removed during the leaching step. 
Currently, turbine blades are inspected with a neutron radiographic method. First, the 
cooling passages in a blade are bathed in a Gd-containing solution to tag any residual ceramic 
core. Gd is a strong neutron absorber that highlights any residual ceramic core when exposed 
to neutrons. If any residual ceramic core is found in the blade, the Gd is washed out of the 
cooling passages and the leaching step is repeated. Neutron radiographic inspection has several drawbacks. First, safety precautions 
required when dealing with a neutron source make the inspection very expensive. Second, 
only a few facilities are capable of performing the neutron radiographic inspection. If these  
 
facilities are not convenient to the blade manufacturing site, the blades must be shipped to the 
inspection facilities. This increases expenses and delays the manufacturing process. Third, 
neutron radiation makes the turbine blades slightly radioactive. As a result, the radioactivity 
in the blades must be allowed to decay to a safe level before further processing. This further 
delays the manufacturing process. Fourth, the Gd compound can

A method for making a hollow metal article, comprising the steps of casting a metal 
article around a ceramic core of an appropriate shape such that the ceramic core is embedded 

inside the metal article and leaching at least a portion of the ceramic core from inside the 
metal article to leave a hollow space in the shape of the ceramic core inside the metal article, 

exposing the article to an x-ray detectable agent, wherein the x-ray detectable agent has a 
higher x-ray density than the ceramic used to make the core, making an x-ray radiograph of 

the metal article after the ceramic core is leached from inside the metal article, and analyzing 
the x-ray radiograph to determine if any ceramic core remains inside the hollow space; 

wherein the method is characterized by:

The method of claim 1, wherein the x-ray detectable agent has a higher x-ray density 
than the metal used to make the article.

an atomic number greater than 56. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the x-ray detectable agent comprises W, Pb, Hf, Ta, 
Th, or U. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the metal article is made from a superalloy. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the metal article is a turbine engine turbine blade. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the x-ray detectable agent is introduced into the 
ceramic core before the leaching step as a doping agent such that the x-ray detectable agent 

becomes an integral part of the ceramic core. 
The method of claim 7, wherein the x-ray detectable agent comprises Hf.  
 
The method of claim 1, wherein the x-ray detectable agent is introduced into any 
ceramic core remaining inside the hollow metal article after the leaching step as a tagging 

agent such that any ceramic core remaining inside the hollow space after the leaching step 
absorbs at least some of the x-ray detectable agent.

The method of claim 9, wherein the x-ray detectable agent is introduced into the 
ceramic core by: 


(i) immersing the metal article in a solution of the x-ray detectable agent such 
that air trapped inside the hollow space can escape, 
(ii) applying a vacuum over the x-ray detectable agent solution to help remove 
air trapped inside the hollow space, 
(iii) leaving the metal article in the x-ray detectable agent solution for a sufficient 
time for pores in any ceramic core remaining inside the hollow space to 

absorb the x-ray detectable agent, and

x-ray detectable agent absorbed by any ceramic core remaining inside the 

hollow space is not removed from the metal article.
