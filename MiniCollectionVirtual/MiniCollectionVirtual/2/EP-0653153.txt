<ABSTRACT>
A milking machine for milking animals, such as 
cows, which is provided with one or more filtration devices 

(8) for filtering milk. Such a filtration device (8) is 
provided with one or more filters (9, 10) and also with 

change-over means (15 to 18) to direct a flow of milk 
automatically through a filter (9, 10) to be cleaned regularly. 

This cleaning is effected by means of a cleaning liquid, 
which is led through the filter (9, 10) in a direction which 

is opposite to that in which the milk passes through the 
filter (9, 10). When a given filter (9; 10) is being cleaned, 

the milk flows through an other filter (10; 9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a milking
machine according to the preamble of claim 1.
Such a filtering device for liquids in general
is disclosed in US-A-4 636 306.Another filtration device is disclosed in DD-A-221625.
This device comprises a disc with filter segments.
Each time a cow is milked, a filter segment is
used to filter the milk by moving the disc in a different
position. After milking the entire herd the filter disc is
removed, cleaned and disinfected. The filtration device
as disclosed in DD-A-221625 has the drawback that it
has to be exchanged manually. This is time-consuming
and inconvenient. Also, the filter exchange interrupts
the milking process. This is particularly inconvenient in
systems of continuous milking, such as robotic milking
systems. NL-A-9300143 discloses a filtration device
which enables exchanging the filters without interrupting
the milking process. This device has the drawback
that the filters need to be replaced and cleaned manually
which is again time-consuming, expensive and
inconvenient.To enable an uninterrupted purification of the
milk, a filtration device according to the invention is provided
with the features of claim 1.
In this way the flow of
milk from animals milked in succession can be purified
by filtration by means of a filter cleaned regularly without
requiring that additional time is allotted for filter cleaning.
When the milk is led through a first filter, a second
filter can be cleaned.In principle, it will be sufficient to provide two filters
in the filtration device, so that, when the milk is
passed through one filter, the other filter is cleaned and,
after this other filter has been cleaned and a certain
number of cows has been milked subsequently, the milk
is passed through the cleaned filter, whereas then the
first-mentioned filter is being cleaned. For this purpose
there are provided automatically operated change-over
means to direct at the same time the milk flow in
one direction through a first filter and a cleaning liquid in
the opposite direction through a second filter.The change-over means may be made up of
multi-way valves, particularly computer-controlled
three-way valves, by which in a first position milk, and in
a second position a cleaning liquid is allowed to pass
through a filter. The filters may be of tubular design and,
extending upwardly, they may be arranged in parallel.
The cleaning liquid can be hot water, which is fed pulsatingly
through a relevant filter.A filtration device in which a flow of milk is automatically
redirect

<CLAIMS>
A milking machine for milking animals, such as cows,
comprising one or more filtration devices (8), the filtration

device being provided with at least two filters (9, 10), and
with connections to pass alternately milk in a first

direction through a filter and a cleaning liquid through this
filter in a second direction, opposite to the first

direction, and wherein, when the connections are in position
to pass milk through one filter a cleaning liquid may pass

through another filter, 
characterized in that
 there are
provided automatically operated change-over means (15 to 18)

to provide for cleaning of one filter when milk is passed
through the other filter, and for passing, after the first

filter has been cleaned and a predetermined number of cows
has been milked subsequently, the milk through the cleaned

filter, whereas then the said other filter is being cleaned. 
A milking machine according to
claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the filtration
device (8) comprises two filters (9, 10).
A milking machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 there are provided
automatically operated change-over means

(15 to 18) to direct at the same time the milk flow in
one direction through a first filter (9; 10) and a

cleaning liquid in the opposite direction through a
second filter (10; 9).
A milking machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the change-over
means (15 to 18) are constituted by multi-way

valves.
A milking machine according to claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the multi-way valves (15 to 18) comprise
computer-controlled three-way valves, which in a

first position allow milk to pass through a filter (9,
10) and in a second position a cleaning liquid.
A milking machine according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 a filter (9, 10) is
of tubular design.
A milking machine according to claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 the filters (9, 10) extending upwardly are
arranged in parallel.
A milking machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the cleaning liquid
is hot water, which is fed pulsatingly through a

filter (9, 10).
A milking machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it is provided
with a milking robot (5) for connecting teat cups (6)

automatically to the teats of an animal present in a
milking parlour (1) and for subsequently milking this

animal automatically, whilst the milk obtained is
routed through an automatically cleaned filtration

device (8) and is purified there.
A milking machine according to claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 the filtration device (8) is disposed near
the milking parlour (1).
A milking machine according to claim 9 or 10,

characterized in that
