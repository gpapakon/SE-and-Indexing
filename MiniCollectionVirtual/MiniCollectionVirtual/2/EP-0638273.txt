<ABSTRACT>
A kitchen machine with a housing (1) and a bowl (9) which can be placed 
on the housing (1) and can be closed with a lid (33). A rotary tool (27) can be placed in 

the bowl (9) and can be driven by means of an electric motor (21) arranged in the 
housing (1). The kitchen machine is provided with a locking device (63) which locks the 

lid (33) during rotation of the tool (27) in order to prevent that a user of the kitchen 
machine can injure himself with the rotating tool (27). 
The locking device comprises a centrifugal member (65, 111) which 
cooperates with a safety member (105). The use of the centrifugal member (65, 111) 

achieves that the lid (33) is not released by the safety member (105) after switching-off 
of the electric motor (21) until the moment the tool (27) has come substantially to a 

standstill. It is prevented in this way that the user can injure himself with the tool (27) 
still running out under the influence of its mass inertia after switching-off of the electric 

motor (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a kitchen machine with a housing and a bowl
which can be placed on the housing and can be closed by means of a lid, while a
rotatable tool can be placed in the bowl and driven by means of an electric motor
arranged in the housing, the kitchen machine being provided with a locking device for
locking the lid during rotation of the tool.A kitchen machine of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is
known from European Patent 0 158 032 and comprises a locking device which is
mechanically coupled to a switch button for operating the electric motor. The locking
device comprises a bush which is journalled in the housing of the kitchen machine and
is provided with two incisions made substantially diagonally opposite one another. The
bush is provided with a concentric disc which has a number of teeth near a
circumference. The switch button is also journalled in the housing and is provided with
a C-shaped rim at a lower side. When the bowl with the lid are not placed on the
housing correctly, the bush will be in such a position that the C-shaped
rim of the
switch button hits against the bush upon rotation of the switch button, and the electric
motor cannot be switched on. It is prevented in this manner that the electric motor can
be switched on while the bowl and the lid are not positioned correctly on the housing.The lid of the bowl comprises a tongue which is also provided with a
number of teeth near a circumference. If the bowl with the lid is placed correctly on the
housing, the tongue is rotated into a recess of the housing, whereby the teeth of the
tongue engage with the teeth of the bush, and the bush is rotated into a position in
which the incisions of the bush are present opposite the ends of the C-shaped
edge of
the switch button. The electric motor can now be switched on by rotation of the switch
button, the C-shaped rim entering the incisions of the bush. After rotation of the switch
button, the bush cannot be rotated anymore, so that the lid of the bowl is locked. It is
prevented thereby that the lid can be removed during rotation of the electric motor and
that the user can injure himself with the rotating tool. A disadvantage of the known kitchen machine is that the lid of the bowl is
released already by the locking device the moment the electric motor is switched off
with the switch button. The user of the kitchen machine may thus remove the lid from
the bowl immediately after switching-off of the electric motor. The user can still injure
himself with the tool then,

<CLAIMS>
A kitchen machine with a housing (1) and a bowl (9) to be placed on the
housing (1) and to be closed by means of a lid (33), while a rotatable tool (27) can be placed in the

bowl (9) and driven by means of an electric motor (21) arranged in the housing (1), the kitchen
machine being provided with a locking device (63,) for locking the lid during rotation of the

tool (27), characterized in that the locking device (63) is provided with a centrifugal member (65)
which is rotatably coupled to a shaft (23) which is drivable by the electric motor (21) and which

is movable from a first into a second position under the influence of a rotation of said
drivable shaft (23), and with a safety member (105) which cooperates with the lid (33) and with the

centrifugal member (65), the safety member releasing the lid (33) in the first position of the
centrifugal member (65) and locking the lid (33) in the second position of the centrifugal

member (65).
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
drivable shaft (23) to which the centrifugal member (65) is coupled is a motor shaft of the electric

motor (21).
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
drivable shaft (23) extends in vertical direction, while the centrifugal member (65) is provided

with a ball (85) which is guided by a guide fastened (71) to the drivable shaft (23) and extending
obliquely relative to the drivable shaft (23) with a positive angle of inclination, and is

provided with a slide (75) cooperating with the safety member (105), resting on the ball (85) and
guided so as to be displaceable parallel to the drivable shaft.
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the
centrifugal member comprises three balls (85) which are each guided in an individual guide (73),

while the guides enclose angles of substantially 120° with one another.
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the
angle of inclination of the guides (73) is substantially 30°.
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that the
locking device (63) is provided with a pivot arm (93) which near one of its two ends is fastened

to a coupling shaft (95) extending transversely to the drivable shaft (23) and journalled in the 
housing (1) and near its other end rests on the slide (75), while the safety member (105) is

displaceable in a direction transverse to the drivable shaft (23) and transverse to the coupling
shaft (95) and is provided with a slot (107) which extends parallel to the drivable shaft (23) and is in

engagement with a pin (103) fastened on a side arm (99) of the coupling shaft (95).
A kitchen machine as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that the pivot
arm (93) rests on a support ball (97) of the slide.
