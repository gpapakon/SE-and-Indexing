<ABSTRACT>
A differential mechanism (10) having two output cam members (22, 23) rotatable about an axis (A) each cam member having a single annular cam surface of undulating form comprising pairs of mutually inclined surfaces (24, 25; 26, 27). The inclined surfaces are engaged by end surfaces (29, 30; 32, 33) of followers (28) so that relative contra rotation of the output cam members (22, 23) causes the cam followers (28) to slide axially. An input element (16) engages and supports the followers and moves the followers circumferentially relative to the output cam members. The input element (16) engages with a radially inner portion (36) of each cam follower to move the follower circumferentially relative to the cam output members (22, 23), and the cam surfaces (24, 25; 26, 27) are inclined (P, P2) away from the axis of rotation (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a differential mechanism 
particularly but not exclusively for use in motor 
vehicles. Differential mechanisms commonly used on vehicles 
are of the sun and planet gear type and have a well 
known disadvantage that when one wheel is on a 
slippery surface such as mud or ice and the other 
wheel is on a firm surface capable of providing 
traction, the first wheel will simply spin as it 
receives all the available power transmitted to the 
differential. Limited slip differential mechanisms have been 
proposed in an attempt to overcome this problem 
which restrict the extent to which one wheel can 
spin relative to the other but such differentials 
are more complex and therefore, more costly to 
produce. In European patent application EP-A-0284329 there 
is proposed an alternative differential mechanism 
comprising two output cam members rotatable about 
an axis, each said member having a single annular  
 
cam surface thereon of undulating form comprising 
pairs of mutually inclined surfaces, and a 
plurality of cam followers having end surfaces 
engaging the cam surfaces of the output cam 
members, the arrangement being such that relative 
contra rotation of said output cam members causes 
the cam followers to slide axially, and an input 
element engaging the followers which are slidably 
supported by the input element and moving the 
followers circumferentially relative to the output 
cam members. Such a differential will hereinafter be called a 
differential of the type described. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a differential of the type described which is 
suitable for use in four wheel drive applications. According to the invention there is provided a 
differential of the type described characterised in 
that the input element engages with a radially 
inner portion of each cam follower to move the 
follower circumferentially relative to the cam 
output members and the cam surfaces face inwardly 
towards the axis of rotation.  
 Preferably one output cam surface is formed on a 
housing containing the differential, and the second 
output cam surface is on a pinion which is 
rotatable within the housing. Conveniently in a four wheel drive application the 
housing is drivably connected to the front wheels 
of the vehicle, and the pinion is drivably 
connected to the rear wheels of the vehicle. Oil pump means may be provided, driven from a 
component of the differential which rotates during 
use of the differential to pump oil into the 
differential. The oil
