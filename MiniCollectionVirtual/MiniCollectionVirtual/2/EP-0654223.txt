<ABSTRACT>
An ambient stable snack product comprising a particulate 
material and a binding material, wherein the product has a 

water activity (Aw) of less than about 0.94 and a pH 
between about 4 and about 6.5. Preferably the particulate 

material comprises or contains meat, creamed coconut, 
desiccated coconut, sunflower seeds, flour, mango, onion, 

butter, satay, barbecue, sweet and sour, chili, or curry 
powder and the binding material comprises egg albumin; a 

carbohydrate binder such as various flours, gums, glucose 
syrup; modified starches such as ZORBIT; gels; thickeners; 

stabilised protein; and the like and mixtures thereof. The 
product may also contain at least one flavouring component 

and/or at least one fat component. A method for preparing 
such a snack product is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ambient stable food product,
especially a hand held ready-to-eat snack product,
characterised by the presence of fat,a low Aw and a low pH.The traditional eating pattern of the developed world
consists three meals that are taken at regular intervals
throughout the day. However the pattern is changing as
people supplement or replace one or more of these main
meals with another, usually light meal, at their
convenience or pleasure.These light meals or snacks are generally intended to be
consumed almost immediately, that is without any cooking or
other method of preparation, and as they are often bought
on impulse, taste is paramount.The problem encountered by researchers in this field is to
prepare a product that contains a perishable food such as
chicken but which remains stable at ambient temperature for
convenience of storage. Micro-organisms thrive in moist
conditions at room temperature which is why foods such as
chicken, which has a water activity of about 0.98, must be
frozen if it is to be stored for prolonged periods.
Methods of preserving food include decreasing its pH and
/or drying but the final product can be at best,
unsuitable for a tasty convenience food and at worst,
simply unpalatable. DE 3,538,805 describes a snack on a stick containing at
least one edible binder, standard additives such as
kernels, nuts, fruits, cereals as well as flavouring and
aromatising agents. The snack food can be made ready-to-eat
by dry-heating and is either after-dried to a water
activity value below 0.9, especially below 0.8, or stored
as a deep-frozen article.GB-A-1 579 324 discloses pet-food, containing meat or other proteinaceous material
and having a water content of 24-45 wt.% and a pH of 4-7, while also a cross-linked
algiante is present.EP-A-0 012 255 discloses pasteurized food products, having Aw-values of 0.86-091
and a pH of 4.5-5.5. Although example 4 defines a vegetable tart which can be fried,
this product only contains limited amounts of fat (about 11 wt.%).The present inventor has developed a tasty, ambient stable,
snack food product and method for preparing same that
overcomes at least some of the difficulties described
above. The superior ambient stability of the product is
believed to be a result of the combination of suitable Aw
and suitable pH, the stability being particularly
surprising when the product contains a perishable protein.According to the present invention there is provided a
snack product comprising a particulate material, fat and a
binding
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ambient stable snack product comprising a
particulate material, fat and a binding material characterised

in that the snack product comprises 20-50 wt% (on snack-product) of fat and that the water activity (Aw) of the product is less than
0.94 and the pH is between 4 and 6.5.
A snack product according to claim 1, wherein the
water activity (Aw) of the product is between 0.4 and

0.9 and the pH is between 5 and 6.
A Snack product according to claim 1, wherein
sufficient water has been removed and glucose syrup added

such that the product is substantially dry and crunchy.
A Snack product according to claim 1, wherein the
product has been sufficiently pasteurised so that the

product is substantially moist and chewy.
A snack product according to claim 1, wherein the
particulate material comprises or contains meat, creamed

coconut, desiccated coconut, sunflower seeds, flour, mango,
onion, butter, satay, barbecue, sweet and sour, chili, or

curry powder and the binding material comprises egg
albumin; a carbohydrate binder such as various flours,

gums, glucose syrup; modified starches such as Zorbit;
gels; thickeners; stabilised protein; and

mixtures thereof.
A snack product according to claim 1, further
comprising at least one flavouring component.
A method for preparing an ambient stable snack product
comprising mixing and moulding a particulate material, a fat and

a binding material, wherein the product has a fat-content of 20-50 wt% (on snack-product) and a water
activity (Aw) of less than 0.94 and a pH between

4 and 6.5. 
A method according to claim 7 for preparing an ambient stable snack product
comprising mixing a flavouring component, a fat component,

a particulate material and a binding material, optionnally after having heated and/or dried the binding material until achieving a 20-25% weight loss
placing the mixture in a mould, cooking the mixture until

achieving a weight loss of up to 50% and removing the snack
product from the mould, wherein the snack product obtained has a fat content of 20-50 wt% a water

activity (Aw) of less than 0.94 and a pH between
4 and 6.5.
