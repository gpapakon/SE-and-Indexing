<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and a method for filling or plugging cigarette-paper tubes. The device has at least one tobacco transfer piston, ram, rod (48, 222) or the like, mounted axially displaceably in a housing (10, 110, 216), for transferring at least one tobacco strand (151) out of a strand casing (150) into an associated cigarette-paper tube (66) which, for this purpose, can be pushed with its open end onto a slip-on nozzle (60), in such a way that the tobacco transfer takes place through the slip-on nozzle (60) into the associated cigarette-paper tube (66). Furthermore, there is provided for the at least one tobacco-filled strand casing (150) a receiving space (23, 23'), in which the latter is held non-displaceably, with external support, during the transfer of the tobacco strand (151) into the cigarette-paper tube (66).
