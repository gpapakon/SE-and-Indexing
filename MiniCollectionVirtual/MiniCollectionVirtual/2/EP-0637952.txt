<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent body in an absorbent 
article, such as a sanitary napkin, panty protector, incontinence 
guard, diaper and like articles. Many different designs of absorbent articles of this kind are 
known to the art. The absorbent body of products of this nature 
are normally comprised of one or more layers of cellulose fluff 
pulp, which is sometimes intermixed with so-called superabsorbents, 
which are polymers that are capable of absorbing water or 
body liquid in quantities equal to several times their own 
weight. The absorbent body may also include other constituents, 
for instance constituents which improve the liquid-dispersing 
properties or the ability of the body to remain intact and also 
its ability to resist deformation in use. SE-B-465 806 describes an absorbent body for use in absorbent 
articles of this kind, said absorbent body including a first 
layer which is intended to lie proximal to the wearer in use and 
which includes a first mixture of fibres, and a second layer 
which includes a second mixture including absorbent fibres. One serious problem with articles of this kind is that they often 
begin to leak long before their total absorption capacity has 
been fully utilized. This is due, among other things, because the 
body liquid discharged by the wearer is unable to penetrate into 
the absorbent material quickly enough and, instead, leaks from 
the sides of the sanitary napkin or incontinence guard. Another problem relates to so-called rewetting, which means that 
absorbed body liquid is pressed back into contact with the 
wearer's skin by external forces, for instance when the wearer 
sits down.  
 It is desirable for the surface of the article which  
 
faces towards the wearer in use, i.e. the proximal surface, 
remains as dry as possible. This is difficult to achieve, particularly 
with sanitary napkins, since the menstruation liquid has 
a high viscosity and therefore tends to fasten to the surface 
material of the napkin. A thin article is also desired, so that the article can be worn 
as discretely as possible. The object of the present invention is to provide an absorbent 
article of the kind defined in the introduction which can be made 
very thin while still being essentially proof against leakage. 
The article shall also exhibit high surface dryness and low 
rewetting tendencies. Another object is to provide an article in 
which the absorbent material has a high tensile strength which 
corresponds to at least 2 N/50 mm in a dry state,

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent body in an absorbent article, such as a sanitary 
napkin, panty protector, incontinence guard, diaper and the like, 

the absorbent body including a first layer (4) which is intended 
to lie proximal to the wearer in use and which includes a first 

mixture of fibres, and a second layer (5) which includes a second 
mixture including absorbent fibres, 
characterized in that
 said 
first mixture is 80-95 percent by weight resilient fibres and 5-20 

percent by weight heat-actuable binding fibres, said heat-actuable 
fibres being actuable at temperatures at which the resilient 

fibres are not heat-actuable; said second mixture is 45-90 
percent by weight absorbent fibres and 5-15 percent by weight, 

preferably 8-10 percent by weight heat-actuable binding fibres; 
and in that the binding fibres have been bonded together by heat 

treatment and function to hold the fibre structures together in 
said layers (4, 5) such that said layers form a laminate having a 

tensile strength of at least 2 N/50 mm in a dry state. 
An absorbent body according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the resilient fibres are comprised of hydrophilic synthetic 

fibres. 
An absorbent body according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the resilient fibres are comprised of wet-stable absorbent 

fibres, e.g. chemi-thermomechanical pulp, or chemically stiffened 
cellulose fibres. 
An absorbent body according to any one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized 
in that
 the binding fibres are comprised of bicomponent 
fibres whose casing material has a lower melting point than the 

fibre core material; and in that the heat treatment of the absorbent 
body has been carried out at a temperature which is lower 

than the core melting point but higher than the casing material 
melting point. 
An absorbent body according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 
the bonds between the binding fibres are so weak that the material 

is able to swell when wetted, therewith to break said bonds.  
 
An absorbent body according to one or more of the preceding 
Claims, 
characterized in that
 the second layer (5) includes 5-30 
percent by weight of a superabsorbent material, calculated on the 

dry weight of the layer. 
An absorbent body according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 
the superabsorbent material is present in at least one layer 

disposed between fibre layers. 
An absorbent body according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 
the superabsorbent material is disposed between tissue layers 

(9). 
An absorbent body according to one or more of the preceding 
Claims, 
characterized in that
 the second layer (5) exhibits a 
compression pattern which functions to increase the dispersion of 

liquid in the longitudinal direction of the absorbent body, said 
compression pattern having the form of longitudinally extending 

compressed bands for instance. 
An absorbent body according to one or more of the preceding 
Claims, 
characterized in that
 the said second layer (5) is 
divided into two layers, a storage layer (5a) and a dispersion 

layer (5b); and in that the storing layer (5a) includes 45-70 
percent by weight absorbent fibres, 5-15 percent by weight heat-actuable 

binding fibres and 5-30 percent by weight superabsorbent 
material and the dispersion layer (5b) includes 80-90 percent by 

weight absorbent fibres and 10-20 percent by weight heat-actuable 
binding fibres. 
A method of manufacturing a web of absorbent material intended 
for an absorbent article, such as a sanitary napkin, panty 

protector, incontinence guard, diaper and like article in accordance 
with Claim 1, 
characterized by
 dry-forming a fibre web on 
top of another, similarly dry-formed fibre web, wherein one of 

the fibre webs includes a mixture of 80-95 percent by weight 
resilient fibres and 5-20 percent by weight heat-actuable binding 

fibres and the other of said fibre webs includes a mixture of 45-90 
percent by weight absorbent fibres and 5-15 percent by weight  

 
heat-actuable binding fibres; and by heating the mutually superimposed 

fibre webs so as to activate the binding fibres and 
thermally bond said fibre webs, which are then compressed to form 

a laminate having a tensile strength of at least 2 N/50 mm in a 
dry state. 
A method according to Claim 11, 
characterized by
 applying 
superabsorbent material in or on the other of said fibre webs in 

conjunction with dry-forming said web.
