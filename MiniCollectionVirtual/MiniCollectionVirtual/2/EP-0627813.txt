<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an integrated amplifier whose gain factor (As) is 
adjusted by means of an auxiliary amplifier (2). The gain factor (As) is determined by 

the ratio of two on-chip resistors (R1, R2) and by the ratio of the dimensions of 
transistors in long-tailed pair circuits (6-2 ... 6-N) in the signal amplifier (3) to those of 

the transistors in the long-tailed pair circuit (6-1) in the auxiliary amplifier (2). Both 
resistance ratios and ratios between complete circuits can be realised highly accurately 

in integrated circuits. As a result, the accuracy of the gain factor (As) is great. In an 
embodiment of the invention the dimensions of the long-tailed pair circuits (6-1 

... 6-N) 
in the auxiliary amplifier (2) and in the signal amplifier (3) are the same. This achieves 

that if the adjusting voltages and adjusting currents of corresponding transistors in the 
long-tailed pair circuits (6-1 ... 6-N) are the same, the gain factor (As) is over a large 

range independent of supply voltage and temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated amplifier comprising an auxiliary
amplifier which includes a first long-tailed pair circuit having an input for receiving an
auxiliary voltage, a signal amplifier which includes at least a second long-tailed pair
circuit having an input for receiving a signal voltage to be amplified, and adjusting
means for adjusting, via a tail current from at least the second long-tailed pair circuit, a
gain factor of the signal amplifier in response to the value of an output current of the
first long-tailed pair circuit.An integrated amplifier of this type may be used, for example, as a
microphone preamplifier in a transmission IC for wire telephony. In that field there is
an important requirement that the gain factor be accurately defined.An integrated amplifier as described in the opening paragraph is known
from US 4,489,282. In the amplifier described in that document the output current of
the first long-tailed pair circuit is compared with an external reference current. The tail
current of one or more long-tailed pair circuits in the signal amplifier is adjusted on the
basis of the difference between these currents. The external reference current is
dependent on an off-chip resistor. External resistors can be obtained with any desired
accuracy. This provides great accuracy of the gain factor to be adjusted. A drawback of
the amplifier described in that document is that it is not fully integrable and, therefore,
relatively expensive due to the presence of the off-chip resistor. In the German Patent
Application DE 41 01 892 A1, an operational transconductance amplifier structure
(OTA) is described, comprising a controlled auxiliary or master OTA and at least one
signal or follower OTA. The transconductance of the master OTA is inversely
proportional to a reference resistor coupled to an output of the master OTA. A control
loop of the master OTA comprises a comparator to one input of which a voltage is fed
being proportional to the reference resistor and an output current of the master OTA
and to another input of which a reference voltage is fed. At least a fraction of the 
reference is also fed to an input of the master OTA. An output of the comparator
provides a control voltage for the master OTA, the control voltage further being
coupled to the follower OTAs of which the transductance is thus also inversely
proportional to the reference resistor. The transconductances of the follower OTAs can
be scaled by scaling factors which are determined by ratios of resistors in the
