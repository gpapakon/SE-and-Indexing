<ABSTRACT>
Suppression of charge loss and hot carrier degradation in EEPROMs and EPROMs, and of instability in the polysilicon pull-up resistors (R1, R2, 14) associated with SRAMs is achieved by the inclusion of at least one layer of silicon-enriched oxide (26, 28, 30) in the MOS structure. In such MOS structures, the silicon-enriched oxide layer (26, 28, 30) may be disposed immediately beneath the interlayer dielectric layer (16), or immediately beneath the inter-metal oxide layer (20), or immediately beneath the passivation layer (24), or in any combination of these locations. Each silicon-enriched oxide layer (26, 28, 30) has a refractive index of at least about 1.50, and preferably contains at least about 10

 METHOD AND STRUCTURE FOR SUPPRESSING CHARGE LOSS IN EEPROMs/EPROMS AND INSTABILITIES IN SRAM LOAD RESISTORSPREDECESSOR APPLICATIONSThis application corresponds to United States Patent application serial no. 07/860,370 (filed March 30, 1992), which application issued as UnitedStates Patent no. on , 1993. Said application serial no. 07/860,370 was a continuation-in-part of United States Patent application serial no. 07/794,922 (filed November 20, 1991 ), which was a continuation- in-part of United States Patent application serial no. 775,085 (filed October 1 1 , 1991 ) of United States Patent application serial no. 07/476,089 (filed March 5, 1990), which application issued as United States Patent no. 5,057,897 on October 15, 1991 .FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to fabricating semiconductor integrated circuit ("IC") MOS and MOS storage devices, and more particular- ly to a method and structure providing internal passivation to suppress hot carrier degradation in MOS devices, to suppress charge loss in memory devices such as electrically programmable read only memory ("EEPROM") devices and electrically erasable and programmable read only memory ("EPROM") devices, and to preserve stability of pull-up resistors in static random access memory ("SRAM") devices.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metal-oxide-silicon ("MOS") devices in general and MOS memory devices in particular can suffer performance and reliability degradation from a number of sources. For example, all MOS devices can suffer from hot carrier degradation. Memory devices such as electrically programmable read only memory ("EEPROM") devices, electrically erasable and programmable read only memory ("EPROM") devices also can suffer from charge loss, which 

affects their ability to reliably store data. Static random access memory ("SRAM") devices can suffer from trapped mobile carriers that affect the stability of associated polysilicon pull-up resistors, which renders accurate data readout difficult.Before examining the nature of these problems and such solutions as are known in the art, it is helpful to briefly review the fabrication of MOS devices, including memory devices.MOS integrated circuits typically provide many MOS devices fabricated on a substrate, with electrical isolation between adjacent devices provided by a field oxide layer. Typically a semiconductor layer comprising active source and drain regions for the MOS devices is covered by gate oxide regions, which regions are in turn covered by first polysilicon
