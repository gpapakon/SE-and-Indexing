<ABSTRACT>
The false floor of the invention exhibits a multiplicity of floor panels (1, 5), which are mounted, in each case in the region of their corners, by means of supports (3) on a firm underlying surface, a cavity being formed between the underside of the floor panels (1, 5) and the underlying surface. In this arrangement, the floor panels (1, 5) are provided in an alternating manner, like the pattern of a chessboard, as lower panels (1) and upper panels (5), the lower panels (1) exhibiting, on their side directed towards the underlying surface, a shoulder (8) which runs around them in a continuous or interrupted manner, juts out like a flange essentially in the panel plane and onto which the upper panels (5) can be laid. Consequently, the gap or the separation joint between the individual panels are covered in the direction of the cavity, as a result of which the degree of fire protection is improved.
