<ABSTRACT>
The shift quality of an automated mechanical 
transmission (10) is improved and transmission wear is 

reduced by controlling the armature current of the motor 
driving the transmission shifting mechanism (22). The 

current is monitored by a microcontroller (16) to 
determine if the shifting mechanism has encountered a 

snag or has stalled during a shift operation. The 
microcontroller (16) is programmed to control the duty 

cycle of a pulse width modulated (PWM) voltage signal, 
applied to the motor, in accordance with an algorithm 

which provides both proportional and derivative control 
of the error between the measured current and a target 

current. The rapid reduction in current spikes through 
PWM control reduces the force applied to the shifting 

mechanism (22) and thus the sliding clutch and 
transmission gearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automated mechanical 
transmission systems wherein gear ratio change is 
accomplished by a DC motor driven shift mechanism and 
more particularly to a method of controlling the force 
applied by the motor in order to improve the shift 
quality and reduce wear of the transmission. Automated mechanical transmission systems 
employing microprocessor based electronic control units 
which respond to various vehicle operating condition or 
to operatcr inputs to effect a gear ratio change or 
shift are well known in the art. See, for example, U. 
S. Patent 5,053,962 assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention. An electric motor driven 
shift mechanism may be used to perform the shift 
operation in response to either a manual or automatic 
shift initiation. See, for example, U. S. Patent 
4,873,881 assigned to the assignee of the present 
invention. In US-A-4,873,881, a shift finger 
is driven by one or more DC motors along an X-X axis to 
select a particular shift rail and along a Y-Y axis to 
effect movement of a sliding clutch into or cut of 
engagement with a gear.  
 There are three possible movements involved in 
the shift of an automated mechanical transmission. The 
three movements are (a) pull to neutral, (b) rail change 
and (c) gear engagement. During pull to neutral the 
sliding clutch of the transmission disengages from one 
of the transmission gears and moves to a neutral or out 
of gear position. During gear engagement the sliding 
clutch moved from the neutral position into gear 
engagement with the selected gear. It is important that 
both gear disengagement and gear engagement be as smooth 
as possible to maximize shift quality and minimize cab 
lurch or jerk. Cab lurch occurs when an unintended or 
unexpected gear engagement or disengagement occurs. During a pull to neutral operation, the 
sliding clutch is preloaded by the shifting mechanism 
with a predetermined force. This preload force is less 
than the frictional force normally developed by 
driveline torque acting on the clutch and the clutch 
therefore remains engaged with the gear. However, 
oscillations in the driveline may cause the frictional 
sliding force developed at the sliding clutch by the 
driveline to drop below the preload force. This can 
result in an premature gear disengagement causing cab 
lurch. It is preferable that disengagement take place 
during the zero torque shift window which occurs 
normally during deceleration of the engine relative to 
the vehicle. Also, if disengagement is
