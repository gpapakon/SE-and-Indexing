<ABSTRACT>
Wall element, in particular a double wall element, for erecting a large-surface-area shuttering wall, comprising wall elements which butt against one another with their lateral abutment edges and exhibit a base plate (1) with rectilinear and mutually parallel, lateral abutment edges (15, 16) on one large side of the base plate. For rapid erection of the shuttering wall, there is configured on the other large side of the base plate (1), behind one abutment edge (15), a fit-in extension (3) which projects beyond said edge, is in the form of a plate and has an obliquely downwardly running bottom end edge (6) and, behind the other abutment edge (16), a fit-in cutout (7) which is adapted to the fit-in extension. Consequently, the wall elements can be fitted in a sliding manner one into the other until the mutually adjacent abutment edges of the two wall elements come into contact with one another.

Wall element for constructing a wall, in particular a 
large-area shuttering wall, comprising a plurality of 

wall elements that abut one another with their lateral 
butt edges (15, 16), the wall element having a base panel 

(1) that is vertical in the installed position with 
straight lateral butt edges (15, 16) parallel with one 

another at the long sides of the base panel (1), wherein, 
looking at the base panel (1), behind the one butt edge 

(15) at the one long side of the base panel (1) there is 
formed a plate-like lock-in projection (3) projecting 

laterally beyond that butt edge, and behind the other 
butt edge (16) on the other long side of the base panel 

(1) there is formed a coupling recess (7) matched to the 
lock-in projection (3), wherein the lower end edge (6) of 

the coupling projection (3) and the lower limiting edge 
(10) of the coupling recess (7) in the installed state 

run obliquely downwards, starting from the butt edge, at 
the same acute angle to the respective butt edge (15, 

16), so that by means of the coupling projection (3) of 
its base panel (1) the wall element is slideably 

insertable in the recess (7) of the base panel (1) of 
another identical wall element until the adjoining butt 

edges (15, 16) of the two wall elements meet one another, 
characterised in that spaced from and parallel with the 

base panel (1) there is arranged a second base panel (1) 
of identical construction, wherein the coupling 

projections (3) and coupling recesses (7) located on the 
two base panels, which projections and recesses are 

arranged behind said panels when looking at the base 
panels (1), face each other and are held together to form 

the double wall element, and the coupling inserts (3) and  
 

the coupling recesses (7) of the base panels (1) are 
formed on the same long side of a respective one of the 

two base panels (1). 
Wall element according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the coupling projection (3) and the coupling recess 

(7) are laterally offset with respect to the plane of the 
respective butt edge (15, 16). 
Wall element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that panel parts (8) defining the coupling projection 

(3) and the coupling recess (7) are mounted, when looking 
at the base panels (1), behind and on said base panels. 
Wall element according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the coupling projection (3) and/or the coupling 

recess (7) is formed on a respective strip (9, 9a). 
Wall element according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each of the two long sides of the 

base panel (1) has a plurality of coupling projections 
(3) and coupling recesses (7) respectively. 
Wall element according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the distribution density of the coupling projections 

(3) and coupling recesses (7) in the lower region of the 
wall element is greater than in the upper region thereof. 
Wall element according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the height of the coupling recess 

(7) measured parallel to the butt edges (15, 16) is 
greater than the respective height of the coupling 

projection (3). 
Wall element according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that it is manufactured substantially  

 
from a cement-bonded material, from rigid gypsum panel 

or from timber. 
Wall comprising several wall elements according to any 
one of claims 1 to 7, in which the wall elements are 

assembled and joined to one another to form a 
prefabricated large-area double wall.
