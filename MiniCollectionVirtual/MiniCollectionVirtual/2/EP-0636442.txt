<ABSTRACT>
A metal cutting tool (1) comprising an exchangeable cutting insert 
(2) having a body portion (3) and a cutting head portion (4); 

said cutting head portion 
comprising an upper rake surface (4a) and a front relief 

flank surface (4b), defining between 
them a cutting edge (4c); and a cutting insert holder (7) formed 

with a pair of clamping 
jaws releasably clamping said insert in said holder, a first 

of said clamping jaws (5) 
being located adjacent said rake surface, a second of said 

clamping jaws (6) being 
located adjacent a base edge (2a) of said relief flank surface, 

a projecting portion (6a) of 
said second clamping jaw extending beyond said base edge (2a); 

a coolant flow 
channel (8) formed in said holder having an inlet adapted to 

be coupled to a coolant 
flow supply; a downstream portion of said channel having an outlet formed in 

said projecting portion and being so formed that a coolant outflow from said outlet 
is directed substantially parallel to said relief surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metal cutting tool according to the preamble of claim 1 and as known from EP-A-0 534 450.With such metal cutting tools, the cutting edge of the insert is defined between a rake surface thereof and a relief flank or clearance face and, in use, the cutting edge and the portion of the relief flank adjacent thereto, become rapidly worn and the insert must therefore be frequently replaced or reversed so as to index a fresh cutting edge in position.Wear of the relief flank starts at the cutting edge itself and progressively extends downwardly in the direction of the base of the cutting insert. It is known that once the extent or depth of the worn region, as measured from the cutting edge, exceeds a certain magnitude, the continued use of that existing edge of the cutting tip deleteriously affects the cutting operation. As a consequence, cutting insert manufacturers specify for each particular type of cutting insert a prescribed maximum depth of flank wear (generally referred to as VBmax) after which the cutting insert should be replaced or indexed.It is well-known that one of the factors which influences flank wear is the hardness of the insert material. Thus, the harder the material the less will be the rate of wear and the longer the cutting insert can be used before wear has reached VBmax requiring replacement However, this hardness is directly related to the working temperature and with rise of working temperature there is an associated reduction in hardness, with a consequent increase in the rate of wear.It is for this reason that, in the use of such cutting tools, means have been provided for the fluid cooling of the cutting insert in the region of the cutting edge thereof.In one known method of fluid cooling, the upper surface of the cutting insert is sprayed with a coolant fluid but it is found that the continued movement of the chip over the rake surface of the cutting insert disturbs the effective cooling of the insert by the coolant.In another known method of cooling; a coolant is passed through the cutting insert from the base thereof to the upper rake surface. It is found in practice, however, that the pressure of the chip on the upper rake surface prevents the coolant from effectively reaching the region of the cutting edge, and here again the efficiency of cooling is limited.A further method which has been employed has been to direct a coolant through a duct formed in the cutting insert or cutting tip, which duct emerges from an aperture in the relief flank of the
