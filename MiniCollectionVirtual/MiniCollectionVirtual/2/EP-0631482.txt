<ABSTRACT>
A device for controlling a flow control valve (18) in the lid (10) of a pressure cooking apparatus. The device comprises a lid handle (12) in which a locking member (25) is radially slidable between two abutment positions to enable free movement of the valve (18) when in a first abutment position, and hold the valve (18) in a flow release position when in a second abutment position. The locking member (25) is resiliently slidable from a return position corresponding to its first aubutment position, and combined with a system (40) for automatically locking and releasing the slidable locking member, which system locks said locking member (25) in a position substantially corresponding to the second abutment position, and automatically releases it when the lid (12) is placed on the pan (1) of the cooking apparatus. The device may be used as a valve control device.

<CLAIMS>
A device for controlling a flow-limiting valve (18) mounted in the lid (10) of 
an appliance for cooking under pressure, said device including a lid 

handle (12) in which a latch (25) is mounted to slide radially between two 
stop positions, enabling the valve (18) to move freely when in a first stop 

position, and keeping the valve (18) in a flow-escape position when in a 
second stop position, the device being characterized in that: 


the latch (25) is mounted to slide resiliently from a return position 
corresponding to its first stop position; and 
the latch (25) is associated with a system (40) for automatically locking 
and unlocking its sliding, said system serving firstly to lock the position 

of said latch (25) in a position corresponding substantially to the second 
stop position, and secondly to unlock it automatically during closure of 

the lid (12) on the bowl (1) of the cooking appliance. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking and 
unlocking system (40) comprises locking means (41, 50) which co-operate 

to lock the latch (25) in its second stop position, and release means (55) 
acting on the locking means (41, 50) during closure of the lid (10) on the 

bowl (1) to ensure separation of the locking means (41, 50) and release of 
the latch (25). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the locking means (41, 
50) are situated on the lid handle (12) and the trip means (55) are situated 

on the bowl handle (2), the two handles (2, 12) being movable relative to 
each other and being designed to be superposed in the closed position of 

the appliance.  
 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the locking means 
comprise firstly a trigger (41) resiliently mounted to move in a receiving 

seat (42) formed in the body of the latch (25), said trigger being provided 
with a locking stud (44), and secondly a stud-engaging catch (50) that is 

stationary and secured to the lid handle (12), said catch (50) and the stud 
(44) being relatively mounted in such a manner as to co-operate to 

prevent sliding of the latch (25) substantially in its second stop position. 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the trigger (41) is 
resiliently mounted to move along a direction that is substantially 

perpendicular to the sliding axis of the latch (25). 
A device according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the trip means 
comprise a stop (56) secured to the bowl handle (2) and disposed thereon 

in such a manner as to be engaged by the locking trigger (41) when the lid 
handle (12) comes close to its closure position relative to the bowl handle 

(2) so as to cause the trigger (41) to be moved away from its locking 
position, thereby releasing the latch (25). 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that it 

includes automatic re-cocking means (29, 60) for re-cocking the locking 
and unlocking system (40) and operated during opening of the cooking 

appliance. 
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that the automatic recocking 
means (29, 60) comprise a control finger (29) secured to the latch 

(25), preferably at the bottom portion thereof, and a control ramp (60) 
designed to be engaged by said finger, said ramp having an inclined 

section (61) and being secured to the bowl handle (2) in such a position 
that, during opening of the lid (10) by rotation, the control finger (29) 

engages the ramp (60) and moves thereover as opening takes place with  
 

a radially outward component, thereby bringing the latch (25) towards its 
second stop position, the inclined section (61) being of sufficient length to 

enable the locking means (41, 50) of said latch to be automatically recocked. 
A device according to claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the latch (25) 
and the trigger (41) are mounted to move resiliently by means of 

compression spring (30, 43). 
A pressure cooker fitted with a device according to any one of claims 1 to 
9.
