<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fastening the load-bearing framework of an installation channel or the like on the base of a housing, comprising a fastening plate which is secured on the base by means of a screw, via a slot formed in said fastening plate, and which bears a screw, connected fixedly to it, for the connection of the load-bearing framework. In order to exclude displacement of the load-bearing framework or of the installation channel as a result of the slot which is necessary for mounting, the fastening plate (7) is provided, on its upper side (11), with a toothing arrangement (12) running transversely with respect to the slot (8), and an intermediate plate (13), which likewise exhibits a corresponding toothing arrangement (14) on its underside, and has a bore for the screw (10), is arranged between the upper side (11) of the fastening plate (7) and the head of the screw (10).
