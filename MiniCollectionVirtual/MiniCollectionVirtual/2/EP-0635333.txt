<ABSTRACT>
The oscillating spindle sander (1) includes 
a housing or frame (3) which supports a worktable (5). A 

drum (9) having a sanding surface extends above the 
worktable (5) to sand a workpiece. The drum (9) is 

driven by a motor (15) which directly drives the drum 
(9) both rotationally and translationally.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spindle or drum sanders and in 
particular to an oscillating spindle sander. Spindle sanders include a rotating drum having a sanding 
surface to sand the edges of workpieces. To improve the sanding 
ability of drum sanders, sanders have been designed which both 
oscillate and rotate the sanding drum. However, motors typically 
output only rotational motion. They do not directly output 
translational motion which is needed to oscillate the sanding 
drum. Thus, to induce oscillation, a series of pulleys, 
cylinders, or cams have been used. The extra moving parts 
required by such a construction not only add to the cost and 
complexity of the sander, but increases the likelihood of a 
malfunction. One such oscillating drum sander is shown in U.S. 
Patent 4,821,457 to Ianuzzi which uses a hydraulic cylinder 
having a pair of control switches to create vertical oscillation 
of the spindle. One object of this invention is to provide an 
oscillating spindle sander in which a single motor directly 
drives the spindle both rotationally and translationally. Another object is to provide such a sander which is made 
of a minimum number of parts, is easy to construct and maintain, 
and is economical to produce. These and other objects will become apparent to those 
skilled in the art and in light of the following disclosure and 
accompanying drawings.  Briefly stated, the invention provides an oscillating 
spindle sander in which the sander is directly driven both 
rotationally and translationally. The sander includes a housing, 
a worktable for supporting a workpiece, a drum extending through 
the worktable and having a sanding surface, and a direct drive 
motor for directly transmitting rotational and reciprocal motion 
to the drum. The motor includes a stator, a rotor, a first means 
for producing a first magnetic field for inducing rotational 
motion and a second means for producing a second magnetic field 
for inducing translational motion. By controlling the creation 
of the first and second magnetic fields, the motor will directly 
drive the drum both rotationally and translationally. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an oscillating spindle 
sander of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the sander with a 
motor shown in phantom; FIG. 3 is a schematic of the electrical connection of 
the motor; and FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a motor used to 
rotate and translate the spindle sander. An oscillating spindle sander 1 includes a frame or 
stand 3 having a
