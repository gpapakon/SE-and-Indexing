<ABSTRACT>
A structure for use in an antenna or as a broadband electromagnetic field simulator, having an open horn TEM waveguide coupled to launch energy in a strip line formed between a forwardly extending plate section and a ground plane. When used as a simulator the test volume is located outside the horn between the forwardly extending plate section and the ground plane. The plate section which functions as a radiating element initially extends parallel to the ground plane and then curves downwardly to terminate adjacent it. In alternative embodiments the plate section extends upwardly, initially with an exponential configuration. In a simulator embodiment it may then terminate at a vertical, grounded wall faced with anechoic material. The horn contains a flat conductor plate positioned parallel to and spaced from the top edge defining an asymmetrical transmission line within the horn. This plate conductor can be coupled to the forwardly extending plate section directly, by means of an RLC coupling network or by means of an array of laterally spaced conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to electromagnetic radiating
structures suitable for use as electromagnetic simulators.
An electromagnetic simulator is a type of test equipment
used for checking the behaviour of equipment in the
presence of strong electromagnetic fields.Continuous Wave (cw) measurement of electromagnetic
susceptibility and radiated interference can be carried out
using multiple antennas whose electromagnetic properties
must be well known in the near field or using TEM cells
whose volume and/or frequency limits make them unsuitable
for broadband testing of large (few metres in height)
electronic sub-systems.Pulse measurements of electromagnetic susceptibility
are currently conducted using parallel line simulators, G-TEM
cells or distributed load conical simulators. The
parallel line simulators suffer from high frequency
limitations. The use of G-TEM cells limits the volume of
the tested object and the conical simulator suffers from
frequency limitations.U.S. Patent No. 4,605,916, issued August 12, 1986, to
Tehon discloses a TEM cell consisting of an outer metal
shielded enclosure having tapered end sections and an inner
metal septum plate dividing the enclosure into upper and
lower sections of approximately equal size. The connector
assemblies at each end of the cell include flanges
connecting the outer conductor of the feed to the tapered
walls and a connection from the inner conductor to the
septum. Due to the reflecting walls of the closed cell the
field uniformity of the TE mode is severely affected and
all higher frequencies are attenuated. The TEM mode which
does propagate is limited to frequencies defined by λ/2
being the height of the septum. Thus only low frequency
performance is achieved. U.S. Patent No. 4,546,358 issued October 8, 1985 to
Edlin et al. discloses a test cell formed in the space
between a parallel plate conductor and ground plane which
together form a transmission line. The parallel plate
conductor is fed by a tapered line section from a coaxial
feed, in order to maintain a constant impedance, and the
parallel plate conductor terminates in a fluted edge to
avoid reflections. The use of the tapered line as the
radiating antenna will not allow connection of the
radiating antenna into other testing structures independent
from the ground as for example in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6.
CA-B- 1273060, issued August 21, 1990 to BBC Brown, Boveri & Co
Ltd (US-A-4,837,581), upon which the precharacterising portion of
claim 1 is based, discloses an EMI testing device using a wave
guide of
