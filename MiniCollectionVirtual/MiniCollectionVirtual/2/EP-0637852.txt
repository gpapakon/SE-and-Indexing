<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
pressurized secondary metal gas cells, such as, nickel 
hydrogen aerospace secondary storage cells. 
Specifically, the present invention relates to an 
improved secondary, metal gas, storage cell of small or 
miniature size and shape, commonly referred to as a 
button cell, except in planar configuration. Metal gas cells, and in particular nickel hydrogen 
batteries, generally include an elongated plate stack 
encased within a sealed metal vessel. The vessel is 
generally in the form of a single cylindrical vessel 
having dome-shaped ends and is filled with a gas under 
pressure, such as hydrogen. Such single cells comprise 
a battery when electrically linked together in either 
series or parallel combinations. An example of such 
secondary cells, useful as aerospace batteries, is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent NO. 4,950,564, the contents of 
which are hereby specifically incorporated herein by 
reference. As can be seen from the referenced patent, a 
plurality of stacked plates are mounted together within 
the single containment vessel. While this particular 
secondary cell design is quite effective, there are 
certain drawbacks to this type of structure. In this 
design and other existing designs, the electrode plates 
are circular in form to conform to the cylindrical 
vessel and are provided with a central aperture to 
receive a core support member. The electrode plates are 
blanked out from larger rectangular materials. 
Accordingly, the use of circular shaped electrode plates 
with central apertures creates a substantial amount of  
 
scrap. Moreover, cells of such a design require a 
multiplicity of smaller diameter positive electrode 
plates utilizing multiple belleville washers to maintain 
proper stack compression for the long service life of 
the cell. This complicated design adds weight and 
volume to the cell. In applications where weight is a 
critical factor, such as, certain aerospace 
applications, the added weight resulting from this 
design is undesirable. In applications where only 
limited space is available, such as, small, high powered 
aerospace applications, the added volume can be even 
more undesirable than the added weight. These and other 
disadvantages associated with such cells were solved by 
my planar cell invention set forth in my copending U.S. 
Patent Application, Serial No. 07/926,062, filed August 
5, 1992, the contents of which are hereby specifically 
incorporated herein by reference. My present invention relates to the use
