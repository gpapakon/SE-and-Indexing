<ABSTRACT>
A single-screw extruder has an integrated gear pump (6), which comprises two gear wheels (10, 11) in engagement with each other, the gear wheel (10) being pushed with a form fit onto the screw shank (2) and driven by it, while the other gear wheel (mating gear wheel) (11) is mounted to the side of the screw shank (2) in a continuation (7) of the barrel. In this arrangement, the gear wheels (10, 11) are surrounded on both their end faces by a stationary pump housing, which is arranged inside the screw barrel (1) and comprises two sealing plates (14, 15) which can be pushed onto the screw shank (2) and are connected with a form fit to the screw barrel (1). The sealing plates (14, 15) have openings for the screw shank (2) and the mating gear wheel spindle to pass through. Furthermore, on the sealing plates (14, 15) or on the screw barrel (1) level with the sealing plates (14, 15) there is provided at least one product passage window (18, 19), open towards the screw chamber.

Single-shaft worm for feeding or extruding highly
viscous products with a built-in gear pump comprising

two gear wheels (10, 11) in mesh with one another, the
one gear wheel (driving gear wheel) (10) being

connected to and driven by the worm shaft (2), while
the other gear wheel (mating gear wheel) (11) is

mounted laterally of the worm shaft (2) in a housing
extension (7), characterized in that


a) the gear pump (6) is integrated into the worm and
the driving gear wheel (10) is slipped positively

onto the worm shaft (2),
b) the gear wheels (10, 11) at their two end faces
are enclosed by a fixed pump housing, which is

disposed inside the worm housing (1) and
comprises two sealing plates (14, 15), which may

be slipped onto the worm shaft (2) and are
positively connected to the worm housing (1),
c) the sealing plates (14, 15) have openings for
passage of the worm shaft (2) and of the mating

gear wheel axle and
d) a product penetration window (18, 19), which is
open towards the worm area, is provided at each

of the sealing plates (14, 15) or at the worm
housing (1) at the level of each of the sealing

plates (14, 15).
Single-shaft worm according to claim 1, characterized
in that the driving gear wheel (10) is mountable as a

fitting element onto the worm shaft (2) and further
worm fittings (3, 4) for kneading or mixing are

optionally provided. 
Single-shaft worm according to claim 1 - 2,
characterized in that the longitudinal part of the

pump housing is formed by the sub-section of the worm
housing (1) lying opposite the ring gears.
Single-shaft worm according to claim 1 - 2,
characterized in that the pump housing additionally

comprises an annular longitudinal housing part (17),
which adjoins the sealing plates (14, 15) in a flush

manner and encloses the two ring gears in an axial
direction.
Single-shaft worm according to claim 1 to 4,
characterized in that the end sealing plates (14, 15)

and the longitudinal housing part (17) have a figure-eight-shaped
contour adapted to the gear wheels (10,

11).
Single-shaft worm according to claim 1 to 5,
characterized in that the gear pump (6) is installed

adjacent to the worm outlet (5).
