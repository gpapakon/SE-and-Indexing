<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for transferring electrically 
conductive coating material comprises a filling station 

having a first coupling element (34) connected to a source of 
the coating material (12) and a shuttle (42) carrying a second 

coupling element (50) which is movable with respect to the 
filling station between a paint transfer position in 

which the coupling elements (34,50) engage and a neutral position 
physically spaced from the filling station. The shuttle (42), 

in turn, is connected to the reservoir of a piston pump (54) 
which communicates with one or more air operated or air 

assist spray guns (64). A high-voltage power supply (68) is 
connected to the metal body of the piston pump (54) to charge 

the electrically conductive coating material immediately 
before it is supplied to the spray gun (64). A 

pneumatic/mechanical control system controls the 
operation of the shuttle (42), pump (54) and electrostatic power 

supply (68) to ensure that a voltage block (30) is maintained 
between the source of coating material (12) and the 

electrostatically charged coating material which is 
discharged from the spray gun (64).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrostatic spray
coating, and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus
for dispensing electrically conducting coating materials
from at least one manually operated dispenser wherein the
source of supply of the electrically conductive coating
material is electrostatically isolated from the high
voltage electrostatic power supply whenever a dispenser is
operating, and wherein such electrostatic isolation is
achieved exclusively with pneumatically and mechanically
operated controls.The application of coating materials using
electrostatic spraying techniques has been practised in
industry for many years. In these applications, the
coating material is discharged in atomised form and an
electrostatic charge is imparted to the atomized particles
which are then directed toward a substrate maintained at
a different potential to establish an 
electrostatic attraction for the charged, atomized
particles. In the past, coating materials of the
solvent-based variety, such as varnishes, lacquers,
enamels and the like, were the primary materials employed
in electrostatic coating applications. The problem with
such coating materials is that they create an atmosphere
which is both explosive and toxic. The explosive nature
of the environment presents a safety hazard should a
spark inadvertently be generated, such as by accidentally
grounding the nozzle of the spray gun, which can ignite
the solvent in the atmosphere causing an explosion. The
toxic nature of the workplace atmosphere created by
solvent coating materials can be a health hazard should
an employee inhale solvent vapors.As a result of the problems with solvent-based
coatings, the recent trend has been to switch to water-based
coatings which reduce the problems of explosiveness
and toxicity. Unfortunately, this switch to water-based
type coatings has sharply increased the risk of
electrical shock, which risk was relatively minor with
solvent-based coatings. The problem of electrical shock
has been addressed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,078,168 and
5,197,676, both owned by the assignee of this invention. 
In systems of the type disclosed in these patents, a
"voltage block", i.e. an air gap, is provided between one
or more sources of the conductive coating material and
the electrostatically charged coating material which is
directed to the coating dispensers. This voltage block
insures that there is never an electrical path between
the source of water-based coating material and the high
voltage electrostatic power supply.In systems of the
