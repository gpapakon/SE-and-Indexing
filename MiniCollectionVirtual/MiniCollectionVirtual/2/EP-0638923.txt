<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an improved
method of etching a cold wall chemical vapor deposition (hereinafter
CVD) chamber and more particularly, relates to an improved method of
in-situ cleaning a substantially moisture-free cold-wall CVD chamber by
a low temperature and low pressure etching process utilizing a reactive
gas of nitrogen trifluoride, chlorine trifluoride, sulfur hexafluoride,
carbon tetrafluoride or the like, or mixtures thereof.References are made in this specification to
pressures denominated in Torr. One unit of Torr is
equivalent to 1.33322 x 102 N/m2 and references to Torr
should be understood accordingly.
References are sometimes made to thicknesses denominated in Angströms (Å). The unit of
Angström is equivalent to 0.1 nanometre. Recent technological advances in the increasing
miniaturization of electronic circuits is made possible by advances in
semiconductor processing. Certain advanced processing techniques
require exposing a semiconductor's structure to a reactant gas under
carefully controlled conditions of elevated temperatures, sub-ambient
pressures, and uniform reactant gas flow. The examples of much
processes include low-pressure CVD, reduced-pressure CVD, and selective
epitaxial deposition.Cold wall CVD systems have been used in recent years for the
deposition of various semiconductor materials on silicon wafers. One of
such low-pressure CVD system is a single-wafer cold-wall CVD system 
utilizing a high-throughput CVD chamber. More stringent standards of
film quality and increasing wafer sizes utilized in recent years are
diverting the equipment technology away from very large batch systems
toward single-wafer processing. Such single-wafer processing equipment
are being designed as a multichamber clustered integrated processing
system incorporating the use of load-lock systems wherein a wafer can be
transported from one single-wafer process chamber to another through a
central load-lock system without breaking vacuum.A typical single-wafer cold-wall CVD chamber is radiantly
heated to enable precise temperature control in the range from about
500°C to about 1,000°C. The wafer is mounted on a susceptor, which is a
silicon carbide coated graphite disc, to receive uniform deposition of
materials on the wafer surface. The susceptor may be rotated by a motor
during deposition to further improve the uniformity of the coating.
This type of thermal reactor for semiconductor processing provides for
high-throughput, flexible thermal control, and process uniformity
