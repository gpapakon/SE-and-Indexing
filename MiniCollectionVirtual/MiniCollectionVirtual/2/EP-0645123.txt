A syringe for the controlled discharge of pasty, dental materials, said syringe
comprising a sleeve-shaped cartridge (2) of plastics which holds the material and

into which a rotary piston (4) is inserted from the one end of said cartridge and
which at its other end comprises a material discharge nozzle (9) which at least at

its end facing the cartridge is made of plastics and which at its end facing away
from the cartridge has an opening width which is smaller than the inside diameter

of the cartridge, with the rotary piston being pushed at its insertion end against a
stopper and being displaceably held in a bearing (7), characterized in that for

fastening the material discharge nozzle to the cartridge filled from its discharge
end with pasty, dental material, said cartridge has about the same cross section

over its length and has its discharge end provided with an edge (13) projecting
over the outside circumference thereof for forming the connecting surface of the

cartridge with the material discharge nozzle, with the connecting surface (11)
being opposite the material discharge nozzle (9) at the edge (13) of a connecting

surface (11), and that an encircling energy flow indicator (15) which faces the
connecting surface (11) of the cartridge (2) and is intended for ultrasonic energy

projects from the connecting surface (11) of the material discharge nozzle (9),
with the cartridge (2) being fastened to the material discharge nozzle (9) via said

indicator after heating by ultrasonic energy.
A syringe according to claim 1, characterized in that the connecting surface (11)
of the material discharge nozzle (9) runs parallel to the front side of the cartridge

(2).
A syringe according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a raised encircling
portion which forms the energy flow indicator (15) is formed on the connecting

surface (11) of the material discharge nozzle (9).
A syringe according to claim 3, characterized in that the energy flow indicator (15)
tapers to a point at its free end.
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the material 
discharge nozzle (9) has an encircling edge (14) which projects beyond the

connecting surface and is in contact with an outside of the cartridge (2).
A syringe according to claim 5 in combination with claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the energy flow indicator (15) is located in a transitional region between the

connecting surface (11) and the projecting edge (14).
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the material
discharge nozzle (9) is provided on its outside with a connecting surface (20)

which is approximately parallel to the connecting surface (11).
A syringe according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the cartridge
(2) and the material discharge nozzle (9) are made of polypropylene.
