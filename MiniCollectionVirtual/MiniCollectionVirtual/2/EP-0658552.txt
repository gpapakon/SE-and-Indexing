<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the preparation of an 
α-tocopherol derivative represented by the following 

formula (VII): 

wherein n stands for 0 or an integer of from 1 to 5. 
According to the process, trimethylhydroquinone and a 

particular allyl alcohol derivative or a specific 
alkenyl alcohol are subjected to a condensation 

reaction in the presence of a fluorosulfonate 
[M(RSO₃)₃]
, a nitrate [M(NO₃)₃] or a sulfate 

[M₂(SO₄)₃], wherein M represents a scandium, yttrium or 

lanthanide atom, and R represents a fluorine atom, a 
fluorinated lower alkyl group, or an aryl group which 

may be substituted by one or more fluorine atoms. The 
lanthanide atom means a lanthanum, cerium, 

praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, 
europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, 

erbium, thulium, ytterbium or lutetium atom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of α-tocopherol derivatives which are
useful as antisterile vitamins, hyperlipidemics, blood
flow increasing agents, oxygen radical scavengers,
anti-cytosenility agents, antioxidants and the like.α-Tocopherol derivatives represented by the
following formula (VII):

wherein n stands for 0 or an integer of from 1 to 5
have heretofore each been prepared by condensing
trimethylhydroquinone represented by the following
formula (I):
 
with one of phytols represented by the following
formulas:

in accordance with a Friedel-Crafts reaction.

   The catalyst is essential for the Friedel-Crafts
reaction. Described specifically, Lewis acids such as
zinc chloride, aluminum chloride, stannic chloride,
ferric chloride, titanium tetrachloride and boron
trifluoride-ether complex as well as combinations of
Lewis acids and protonic acids such as hydrochloric
acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid have been used.
For example, a process employing zinc chloride and a
hydrogen halide in Japanese Patent Publication No.
21835/70, a process using ferric chloride and hydrogen
chloride is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open (KOKAI) No. 14176/72; a process employing
stannic chloride and hydrogen chloride in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 21712/70, and a process relying
upon a boron trifluoride-ether complex in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 8821/72.The catalysts employed in the conventional
preparation processes of α-tocopherol derivatives (VII)
are accompanied by the problem that they cannot be
recovered and reused because they are extremely
unstable to water and are decomposed or deactivated
upon contact with water formed in the reactions or
during washing with water. These catalysts are also 
accompanied by the economical drawback that they have
to be used in a stoichiometrically equivalent amount
relative to trimethylhydroquinone or the corresponding
phytol and they account for a large percentage of the
production cost despite their use as catalysts. They
also involve the problem that they require a larger
reactor and the disposal of greater waste. Further, it
is difficult from the standpoint of environmental
conservation to dispose zinc, tin, phosphorus and the
like. The conventional preparation processes are
therefore not considered to be industrially suited.The conventional catalysts employed in the
preparation of the α-tocopherol derivatives (VII)
involve many problems in economy, handling, waste
disposal and the like as described above. It has
