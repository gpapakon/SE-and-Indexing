<ABSTRACT>
A hard facing alloy is applied to a surface of a 
substrate by making a mixture of at least two 

constituents whose net composition is the desired hard 
facing alloy composition. The constituents have 

different solidus temperatures, at least one of which is 
above a processing temperature of the substrate and 

another of which is below the processing temperature of 
the substrate. In one preferred approach, the mixture 

is prepared by pressing and lightly sintering the 
constituents in the form of powders, so that the mixture 

retains its shape and can be attached to the substrate 
surface. Then the substrate is heated to the processing 

temperature and maintained for a time sufficient to 
permit interdiffusion of the several different phases 

toward a homogeneous hard facing alloy composition 
uniformly through a major portion of the volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the protection of 
materials from wear damage, and, more particularly, to 
the application of a hard, wear resistant coating to a 
surface of a metallic substrate. In some of the most challenging materials 
applications, a load-bearing metallic alloy is used in a 
wear-producing environment that gradually wears the 
material away. Most strong, tough alloys are not 
sufficiently wear resistant to survive for extended 
periods in such environments. To provide the necessary 
combination of properties, materials systems have been 
developed having hard, wear-resistant coatings applied 
onto more ductile substrates to protect them. The 
coatings are often known as "hard facings". One common method of applying a hard facing or 
coating onto a substrate is welding. A bead of the hard 
facing material is melted and deposited upon the surface 
of the substrate. The surface region of the substrate 
is usually also melted, forming a weld pool of hard 
facing material and substrate material that solidifies 
with the coating bonded to the substrate. (This use of 
the term "welding" is not to be confused with the 
joining of two pieces by melting them at their surfaces, 
another common usage of the term.) Weld application of a hard facing is widely and 
successfully used. However, it has important 
disadvantages in some situations. The surface of the 
substrate is heated, melted, and rapidly solidified,  
 
which may result in cracking of the surface. The melted 
substrate mixes with the hard facing alloy, diluting the 
hard facing alloy away from its preferred composition. Weld application of hard facings is a slow, 
expensive process, and often requires a skilled 
craftsman in order to achieve good results. 
Consequently, the quality and thickness of the weld 
coating are sometimes unpredictable due to personnel, as 
well as manufacturing variations. The substrate must 
often be specially heat treated after application of the 
coating, in order to reduce stresses which could cause 
the coating to fail during service. There is a need for an improved method for 
application of hard coatings to surfaces of substrates. 
The method should overcome the foregoing disadvantages 
of the welding process. The present invention fulfills 
this need, and further provides related advantages. The present invention provides a method for 
application of hard facing overlay coatings to surfaces. 
It is more controllable than welding, faster to use, and 
achieves more consistent results. It is also more 
econo

A process for hard facing a substrate, 
comprising the steps of: 

   identifying a hard facing alloy composition; 
   providing the hard facing alloy composition as a
