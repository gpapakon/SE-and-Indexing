<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a metal expansion anchor for anchorage in a bore of a masonrywork structure, which anchor exhibits a bolt (1), having a plurality of expansion cones (9) attached in a thread (8), and an expansion sleeve (2) which is provided with an internal thread (10) adapted to the expansion cones (9). In order to achieve high retaining forces along with a low drawing-in force, the expansion portions (12) are formed along the internal thread (10) of the expansion sleeve (2) at regular intervals by U-shaped clearances (11). The expansion sleeve (2) is produced from metal powder by injection moulding, using a binder system, with subsequent binder extraction and sintering, the injection moulds for the internal thread (10) of the expansion sleeve (2) exhibiting an unscrewable thread core.

An expansible anchor of metal having a bolt (1), the bolt having
several connected expander cones (9) in the form of a thread, and an

expansible sleeve (2), which is provided with an internal thread matching
the expander cones (9) and is arranged to be anchored in a hole drilled in

masonry by drawing in the bolt (1), the expansible sleeve (2) being
pressed radially outwards via the expander cones (9), 
characterized in
that
 expandable expansible portions (12) are formed at uniform intervals
along the internal thread (10) of the expansible sleeve (2) by U-shaped

channels (11) in the expansible sleeve (2).
An expansible anchor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

between the channels (11) of the lateral edges (13) of two adjacent
expansible portions (12) there remains a web (14), the wall thickness of

which is reduced by grooves (15) in the outer wall.
An expansible anchor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the angle of pitch (α) of the expander cones (9) of the bolt (1) arranged to
form a thread (8, 10) and of the expansible portions (12) of the expansible

sleeve (2) lies between 20° and 50°, and is preferably 25°.
An expansible anchor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

between the threads (8, 10) of the expansible sleeve (2) and the bolt (1)
there is a clearance, and the pitch (α
H
) of the thread (10) of the expansible
sleeve (2) is slightly steeper than the pitch (α
B
) of the thread (8) of the bolt
(1). 
An expansible anchor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the front end face (17) of the expansible sleeve (2) is closed by a wall
(18).
An expansible anchor according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

projections (19) are arranged on the outer wall of the expansible sleeve
(2), preferably at the rear end, to safeguard against rotation.
A method for the manufacture of a sleeve-shaped expansible
sleeve (2) of metal for an expansible anchor with a bolt (1), the bolt (1)

having several connected expander cones (9) forming a thread, according
to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the expansible
sleeve (2) is manufactured from powdered metal by an injection-moulding

method using a system of binders combined with subsequent removal of
binders and sintering, the injection moulding tool having a removable

thread core for the internal thread (10) of the expansible sleeve (2).
