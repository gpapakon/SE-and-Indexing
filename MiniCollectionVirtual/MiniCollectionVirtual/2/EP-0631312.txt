<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device includes vertical 
placement part (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d) for mounting the 

semiconductor device on a surface of a circuit board 
(11) in a vertical position, and a connection part (14) 

for making electrical connections between the circuit 

board (11) and a semiconductor element (13). A stage 
(15) is provided on which the semiconductor element 

(13) is placed. The stage has supporting members 
causing the semiconductor device to vertically stand on 

the circuit board. Wiring boards (17, 18), stacked on 
a side of the stage (15) on which the semiconductor 

element (13) is placed, have windows (22) in which the 
semiconductor element (13) is located. The vertical 

placement part (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d) includes wiring 
lines extending between edges of the circuit boards 

facing the circuit board and peripheries of the 
windows. The wiring lines have ends located in the 

vicinity of the edges of the circuit boards and have a 
shape enabling the semiconductor device to be mounted 

on the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to
semiconductor devices, and more particularly to a
semiconductor device which can be mounted on a circuit
board so that the semiconductor device stands
vertically.In recent years, a surface mounting package
has been widely used in which a semiconductor device is
soldered on a circuit board, rather than holes made to
the circuit board and used to solder leads thereon. A
package placed vertically on the mounting surface of
the circuit board (hereinafter referred to as a
"vertical package") is known in order to increase the
density of mounting on the circuit board.It is desired to achieve a package which has
the advantages of both the surface mount package and
the vertical package.A semiconductor device having a package
structure having the advantage of the surface mount
package and the advantage of the vertical package is
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
2-21645. Fig. 1 shows a semiconductor device 1
disclosed in the above application.In Fig. 1, a resin package 2 houses a
semiconductor device 3. Inner lead portions 4a of
leads 4 are connected with the semiconductor device 3,
and the outer lead portions 4b thereof extend out of
the package 2. Further, predetermined tip portions of
the outer leads 4b are bent at the same angle.Spacers 5 are placed on both ends of the
section from which the outer leads 4b of the package 2
extend. Each of the spacers 5 includes a clip 6 and a 
cylinder part 7 with the diameter contractible. The
spacers 5 are used, as shown in Fig. 2, to mount the
semiconductor device 1 on a circuit board 8.Slots 8a with which the relevant cylinder
parts 7 can be engaged are formed on the circuit board
8. The semiconductor device 1 is made to stand
vertically on the circuit board 8 by engaging the
cylinder parts 7 with the slots 8a of the spacers 5.
The outer leads 4b are soldered to a pattern 8b formed
on the circuit board 8.However, with the semiconductor package 1,
the slots 8a are needed to vertically place the
semiconductor packages 1 on the circuit board 8.
Unlike normal surface mount packaging, the holes 8a
have to be formed before mounting. This is a problem
because it reduces mounting efficiency.Also, as shown in Fig. 2, the outer lead 4b
extends for a relatively long distance toward the
circuit board 8 and is bent. The bent portion of the
outer leads 4b is soldered to the pattern 8b formed on
the circuit board 8. That is, the outer lead 4b has a
long portion extending out of package 2. External
disturbances may enter through
