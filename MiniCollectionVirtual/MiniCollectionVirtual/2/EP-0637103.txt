<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector comprises, an insulative 
housing block (2), electrical contacts (4) held by the 

housing block (2), spring fingers (11) on each of the 
contacts (4) for gripping onto a conductive pin, 

cavities (6) in an insulating housing (5) for receiving 
the fingers (11), mouths opening into the cavities (6) 

for receiving conductive pins to be gripped by the 
spring fingers (11), and a break way key and latch 

assembly (30) for connecting together the housing block 
(2) and the housing (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a removable key for
electrical connectors, and, more particularly, to a
break away key and latch assembly for an electrical
connector.An electrical connector known from US-A-4,984,992
comprises an insulative housing block,
electrical contacts held by the housing block, spring
fingers on each of the contacts for gripping onto a
conductive pin, and cavities in an insulating housing
for receiving the fingers. The pin extends into a mouth
of the cavity, the spring fingers are inserted into the
cavity and grip onto the conductive pin.According to an electrical connector assembly,
as disclosed in US-A-4 506 940, electrical cable
connectors are connected to respective groups of
electrical wires. The connectors are adapted for mating
connection with a header. The connectors are adapted
with electrical contacts connected to the wires to
connect the wires to an array of conductive pins
projecting through a bottom of the header.According to US-A-4,984,992, a cable connector
comprises respective groups of electrical wires
terminated with electrical contacts in multiple housing
blocks. The housing blocks are nested together in a
housing. Removable keys on a connector are disclosed in
US-A-4,773,881. The keys are joined to the connector
by weakened areas. Each of the weakened areas can be
broken to remove a selected key from the connector.An object of the invention is to provide a removable
key for a connector, the key being unitary with a latch,
and the key being removable from the latch.Another object of the invention resides in a key
unitary with a latch for retaining together separate
parts of an electrical connector, the key being
removable from the latch.Another object of the invention resides in a key
having removable keying elements joined with a latch for
retaining together an insulating housing and an
insulating housing block of an electrical connector.There is disclosed herein
an electrical connector
comprising at least one external key on the connector
being received by the keying elements to align the
connector for connection with selected pins, the key
being removable for replacement by another key, and a
combination of removable fingers of the key comprising
at least one finger removed and at least one other
remaining finger on the key, the remaining finger being
received by the keying elements.The present invention consists in an
electrical connector comprising a housing block
including electrical contacts therein and a projection,
an insulating housing member disposed onto
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector comprising a housing
block (2) including electrical contacts (4) therein and

a projection (25), an insulating housing member (5)
disposed onto the housing block, and a latch (31) for

latching the housing block (2) and the housing member
(5) together, wherein


said latch includes a key member (32) joined together
with said latch, said latch removably disposed in said

housing member (5) and having a hook (33) for hooking
into said projection (25) thereby latching said housing

block (2) and said housing member (5) together;
said housing member (5) includes a passage (27)
through which the latch (31) passes to engage and

connect with the projection (25).
An electrical connector as recited in claim 1,
wherein the latch (31) includes a knob (34) projecting

from the latch (31) and constructed for registration on
an exterior of the housing member (5).
An electrical connector as recited in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the key member (32) is removably joined with the

latch (31) such that the key member (32) may be broken away from the latch.
An electrical connector as recited in claim 1,2 or 3,
wherein the housing member (5) includes a window (28)

aligned with the hook (33) on the latch (31).
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the passage (27) in the housing member (5) 

aligns with a keyway (26) along which the key member
(32) extends.
An electrical connector as recited in claim 5,
wherein a window (28) through the housing member (5)

communicates with the passage (27), the window being
aligned with the hook (33) on the latch (31).
An electrical connector as recited in any of claims 1 to 6,
wherein multiple additional key members (32) in parallel

with one another and joined to multiple additional
latches (31), a knob (34) bridging across the additional

latches (31), multiple additional housing blocks (2) and
multiple additional housing members (5) having multiple

additional passages (27) through which the additional
latches (31) can pass to engage and connect with the

housing block (2).
