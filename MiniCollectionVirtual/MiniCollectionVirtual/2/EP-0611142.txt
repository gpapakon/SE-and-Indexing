<ABSTRACT>
A process for optically joining a plurality of 
optical fibers to an opponent member (50), comprising the 

steps of forming an optical fiber array by fixing the 
optical fibers (6) between a V-grooved base plate (1) and 

a fixing base plate (2) with the optical fibers fitted in 
respective V-grooves formed on a surface of the V-grooved 

base plate, and optically joining the optical fibers of 
the optical fiber array to the opponent member by using, 

as a joining reference surface, either one of a first 
surface (2a) of the fixing base plate at which the 

optical fibers are fixed and a second surface of the 
fixing base plate (2b) opposite to said surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
optically joining an optical fiber array to an opponent
member.In order to optically join an optical fiber to
an opponent member such as an optical waveguide, it is
necessary to coincide a center of a core of the optical
fiber with an optical center of the opponent member.
For this purpose, an optical fiber array is first
prepared by fixing the optical fiber between a V-grooved
base plate and a fixing base plate, and this optical
fiber array is aligned with the opponent member.
In order to accurately effect this alignment, the
following processes have been heretofore developed and
investigated.According to a first process, an optical fiber
array and an opponent member are placed on respectively
separate stages, a light beam is led into the optical
fiber array as an input terminal, and the optical fiber
array is joined to the opponent member after alignment 
through which one or two stages are finely moved to make
a power of the light beam emitted from the opponent
member maximum. This process is the most general and
practical process currently performed. However, the
process requires a complicated system, and complexity
and cost required for the completion of the joining pose
great problems.According to a second process, a guide groove is
formed in an optical fiber array and a corresponding
guide groove is formed in an opponent member. Then,
alignment is effected between them by inserting a guide
pin into both the guide grooves. However, this process
has the problem in that it takes a time to form the
guide grooves. In particularly, since the guide groove
must be formed on the opponent member without grinding
the upper surface thereof when the opponent member is an
optical waveguide substrate, it is very difficult to
attain given accuracy.JP-A-2-125209 discloses a process of this type, in which
are clamped between a pair of plates which both have
V-grooves for them. In addition both plates have larger V-grooves
for guide pins. One plate overlies and contracts the opponent member. According to a third process, an optical fiber
array is aligned with an opponent member by using given
outer surfaces of the optical fiber array and the
opponent member as reference surfaces. This process is
very attractive in that the alignment is automatically
effected only by inserting both the array and the
opponent member into a given package. However, there
has been no manufacturer who had succeeded in the 
actually industrial development of the third process,
and this

A process for optically joining a plurality of
optical fibers to an opponent member, comprising the

steps of forming an optical fiber array by fixing the
optical fibers between a V-grooved base plate (1) and a

reference jig, and while an optical center of the
opponent member is aligned with centres of cores of the

optical fibers.

Claims 1 to 3 wherein bared portions of the optical 

fibers are fitted to the V-grooves (3) of the V-grooved

portion and the
 receiving base plate portion,
