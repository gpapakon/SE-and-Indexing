<ABSTRACT>
A management centre (37) of the DAMA type performs dynamic allocation of communication resources on demand. Communication between an outgoing switching centre (301), formulating a request for communication, connected to an outgoing traffic station (311), and an incoming switching centre (302), connected to an incoming traffic station (312) is established by use of an outgoing traffic station (311) comprising: - means (331) for routing the communication requests on frames cut up into time intervals each corresponding to a predetermined incoming traffic station (312), - means (35) for detecting the arrival of communication requests in the frames, - means (36) for transmitting, to the management centre (37), a request for allocation of resources comprising designation of the outgoing traffic station (311) and that of the incoming traffic station (312).

4
), an originating switching
centre (30
1
) formulating a call request via an originating traffic station (31
1
)
connected to said originating switching centre (30
1
) and responding to said call
requests by assigning a resource of said satellite (38) and a resource of a

terminating traffic station (31
2
) connected to a terminating switching centre (30
2
)
with which a call is to be set up in order to provide communication between said

originating traffic station (31
1
) and said terminating traffic station (31
2
),

characterized in that said originating traffic station (31
1
) comprises:

means (33
1
 to 33
4
) for routing call requests formulated by said originating
switching centre (30
1
) on frames divided into time slots, each time slot
corresponding to a predetermined terminating traffic station (31
2
),
means (35) for detecting the arrival of call requests in said frames, and
means (36) for transmitting to said management centre (37), in response to
each call request, a resource assignment request comprising the identity of said

originating traffic station (31
1
) and that of said terminating traffic station (31
2
).
System according to claim 1, characterized in that said means (33
1
 to 33
4
) for
routing said call requests in predetermined time slots comprise a PABX

connecting said originating switching centre (30
1
) to said originating traffic
station (31
1
).
System according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that said resources are
carrier frequencies assigned to modems (32) in said traffic stations (31
1
 to 31
4
),
each modem (32) being connected by time slot selector means (34) to said

means (33
1
 to 33
4
) for routing call requests formulated by said originating
switching centres (30
1
) in frames divided into time slots.
System according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that said resources are
time slots of a frame transmitted between said originating (31
1
) and terminating
(31
2
) traffic stations.
System according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said
telephone switching centres (30
1
 to 30
4
) form a meshed network.
System according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said
telephone switching centres (30
1
 to 30
4
) form a star network. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that said call
requests comprise four-bit words (b1 to b4; b5 to b8) conveyed in one half-slot

of time slot IT16 of a frame including 32 time slots in total.
Traffic station (31
1
 to 31
4
) of a communication system via satellite links between
telephone switching centres (30
1
 to 30
4
), each switching centre (30
1
 to 30
4
)
being connected to a traffic station (31
1
 to 31
4
),

characterized in that it includes:

means (33
1
 to 33
4
) for routing call requests formulated by said switching
centre (30
1
 to 30
4
) to which it is connected in frames divided into time slots,
each time slot corresponding to a predetermined destination traffic station (31
2

to 31
4
),
means (35) for detecting the arrival of call requests in said frames, and
means (36) for transmitting to a management centre (37) in response to each
call request, a resource assignment request comprising its identity and that of

said destination traffic station (31
2
 to 31
4
).
Method of communication by satellite link between telephone switching centres
(30
1
 to 30
