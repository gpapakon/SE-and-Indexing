<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an electric machine whose windings (85) are connected to controllable semiconductor valves (101), in particular of the power-transistor type, the windings (85) also being in heat-exchange contact with a fluid-coolant cooling device. The coolant channel (93, 99) in the cooling device is integrated with the windings as a single component. The cooling device generates a forced flow of fluid coolant, in particular a liquid coolant, in the coolant channel (93, 99). In order to decrease the space requirements of the cooling system and at the same time improve the operating characteristics of the machine, the invention proposes that the semiconductor valves (101) also form part of the component and are also in heat-exchange contact with the coolant in the coolant channel (93, 99).
