<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF DETERMINING OPTIMUM AB ERIAL APPT.AWATTOWTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention generally relates to pressure measurement systems, and more particularly relates to a method for non-invasively determining the intra-arterial blood pressure of a wearer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSystems for measuring the intra-arterial blood pressure of a patient can be subdivided into two main groups—those which invade the arterial wall to access blood pressure and those which use non-invasive techniques. Traditionally, the most accurate blood pressure measurements were achievable only by using invasive methods. One common invasive method involves inserting a fluid filled catheter into the patient's artery.While invasive methods provide accurate blood pressure measurements, the associated risk of infection and potential for complications, in many cases, outweigh the advantages in using invasive methods. Because of these risks associated with invasive methods, a non-invasive method, known as the Korotkoff method is widely used.The Korotkoff method is known as an auscultatory method because it uses the characteristic sound made as the blood flows through the artery to mark the points of highest (systolic) and lowest (diastolic) blood pressure. Although the Korotkoff method is non-invasive, it only provides a measurement of the highest pressure point and the lowest pressure point along the continuous pressure wave. While systolic and diastolic pressure are sufficient for accurate diagnosis in many instances, there are many applications in which it is desirable 

to monitor and utilize the entire characteristic curve of the blood pressure wave. In these applications, the Korotkoff method is simply incapable of providing ample information. In addition to this limitation of the Korotkoff method, it necessitates the temporary occlusion (complete closing) of the artery in which blood pressure is being monitored. While arterial occlusion iε not prohibitive in many applications, there are occasions where the patient's blood pressure must be monitored continuously (such as when undergoing surgery) and accordingly, the prohibiting of blood flow, even on a temporary basis, iε undesirable.Because of the above-mentioned risks involved with invasive blood pressure measurement, and the shortcomings of the Korotkoff method, extensive investigation has been conducted in the area of continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and recording. Some of these non-invasive techniques make use of tonometric principles which take
