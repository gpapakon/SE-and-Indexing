<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle crash cushion (10) is mounted to a 
wall (W) adjacent to a roadway (R). The cushion (10) 

includes an array of panels (12) positioned to overlap 
one another and oriented parallel to the wall (W). A 

mechanical linkage (16) couples the panels (12) to the 
wall (W) and suspends the panels (12) above grade such 

that the panels (12) are movable toward the wall (12). 
Energy absorbing elastomeric tubes (30) are positioned 

between the panels (12) and the wall (W) such that 
movement of the panels (12) toward the wall (W) deforms 

the energy absorbing elastomeric tubes (30), thereby 
retarding movement of the panels (12) toward the wall 

(W).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle crash 
cushion for decelerating a vehicle that has left a 
roadway and is moving toward a wall. Young U.S. Patent 3,672,657 (assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention) discloses a vehicle 
crash cushion of the general type defined above. The 
Young system includes an array of parallel diaphragms 
with water-filled energy absorbing elements between the 
diaphragms. The outermost diaphragms are arranged to 
overlap, and the entire assembly is mounted to slide on 
slide plates perpendicular or adjacent to a wall. An 
impacting vehicle will move the outermost diaphragms 
toward the wall, thereby accelerating water in the 
energy absorbing elements. In this way, the severity 
of the impact between the vehicle and the wall is 
substantially reduced. The Young crash cushion has shown itself to 
be quite effective in actual use. In one installation 
the Young crash cushion was placed on a wall at a 
freeway turn in Detroit. Over ten years of practical 
experience have shown a substantial reduction in 
serious injuries and fatalities. Nevertheless, the Young crash cushion is not 
without drawbacks, primarily with respect to the level 
of maintenance required to maintain the crash cushion  
 
in an operational condition. It has been found that 
there is a tendency for the outermost diaphragms not to 
return to the original position after an impact. In 
some applications this may require that an entire 
freeway be shut down while the outer diaphragms are 
pulled back to the operational position. In practice 
there is a tendency to delay such maintenance, and the 
diaphragms themselves are more susceptible to damage if 
hit by a second impact at a time when they have not 
recovered properly from the first. Furthermore, the 
Young crash cushion includes a number of interior 
diaphragms which are susceptible to damage in a severe 
impact. Certain elements are formed of wood, which are 
susceptible to water damage and rotting, and debris 
such as sand and litter tends to be trapped within the 
system. It is difficult to remove this debris, and 
excessive sand can build up inside the unit and 
interfere with the operation of the crash cushion. The present invention is directed to an 
improved vehicle crash cushion which is less 
susceptible to the maintenance problems of the Young 
crash cushion described above. According to this invention, a vehicle crash 
cushion is provided for decelerating a vehicle that has 
left a roadway and is moving toward a wall. The

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle crash cushion (10) for decelerating 
a vehicle that has left a roadway (R) and is moving 

toward a wall (W), said cushion comprising: 

a plurality of panels (12) positioned to 
overlap one another partially along an anticipated 

impact direction (A); 
a mechanical linkage (16) coupled to the 
panels (12) to suspend the panels (12) above grade 

adjacent the wall (W) such that the panels (12) are 
oriented generally parallel to the wall (W) and the 

panels (12) are movable toward the wall (W); and 
a plurality of energy absorbing elements (14) 
positioned adjacent the panels (12) between the panels 

(12) and the wall (W) and suspended above grade at 
least in part by the linkage (16) such that movement of 

the panels (12) toward the wall (W) deforms the energy 
absorbing elements (14), thereby retarding movement of 

the panels (12) toward the wall (W). 
The cushion of Claim 1 wherein the linkage 
(16) is configured to raise the panels (12) as the 

panels (12) move toward the wall (W). 
The cushion of Claim 2 wherein the linkage 
(16) comprises a plurality of support struts (38), each 

pivoted at a first end adjacent the wall (W) and at a 
second end adjacent a respective panel (12). 
The cushion of Claim 3 wherein the linkage 
(16) further comprises a plurality of suspension cables 

(44) anchored at one end and coupled to the struts (38) 
to limit movement of the support struts (38) away from  

 
the wall (W) and thereby to hold the panels (12) above 

grade. 
The cushion of any preceding claim wherein each of the 
energy absorbing elements (14) comprises an elastomeric 

element. 
The cushion of Claim 5 wherein each of the 
elastomeric elements (14) comprises an elastomeric tube 

(30), wherein adjacent ones of the elastomeric tubes 
(30) are secured together to form a cluster, and 

wherein only one of the elastomeric tubes (30) in each 
cluster is secured in a fixed position with respect to 

the wall (W). 
The cushion of claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the 
elastomeric elements (14) adjacent the panels (12) 

define protruding elements (36) which bear on low 
friction bearing surfaces (37) defined by the panels 

(12). 
The cushion of any preceding claim wherein adjacent 
panels (12) are interconnected by slip joints (48) that 

allow relative movement between adjacent panels (12) in 
an impact. 
The cushion of any preceding claim further comprising a 
plurality of longitudinally extending cables (46) 

extending between the wall (W) and respective panels 
(12), said longitudinally extending cables (46) 

oriented to prevent excessive movement of the panels 
(12) in the anticipated impact direction (A) during an 

impact.  
 
The cushion of any preceding claim further comprising a 
plurality of mounting brackets (18), wherein the 

mechanical linkage (16) and the energy absorbing 
elements (14) are mounted to the mounting brackets 

(18), and wherein the mounting brackets (18) are 
mounted to the wall (W). 
The cushion of Claim 3 wherein the first 
end is dispersed at a lower elevation than the second 

end, and wherein said support struts (38) are oriented 
at an acute angle less than 45Â° with respect to the 

wall (W) such that movement of the second ends toward 
the wall (W) raises the second ends.
