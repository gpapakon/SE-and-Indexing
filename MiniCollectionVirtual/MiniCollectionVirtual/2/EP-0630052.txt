<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 
metal-insulation-silicon (hereunder abbreviated as MIS) 
type semiconductor device, which can be employed as, for 
example, a read-only memory, and a method for producing an 
MIS type semiconductor device. In recent years, there has been a marked tendency 
to develop a large capacity and highly-integrated 
semiconductor device. Moreover, there has been increased a 
demand for a very fine semiconductor device. Thus, a 
layout of a semiconductor pattern and a structure of a 
semiconductor device, which are more advantageous for 
producing a very fine semiconductor device (namely, for 
microminiaturizing a semiconductor device), are required. 
This holds true for a read-only memory. Meanwhile, a threshold voltage of an MIS type 
transistor an be controlled according to the kinds and 
concentrations of impurities to be added to a semiconductor 
substrate, which is employed as a channel, in a diffusion  
 
process. In a read-only memory, information is selectively 
stored according to whether or not an operating threshold 
voltage of a gated transistor is greater than a reference 
voltage. An example of a conventional MIS type 
semiconductor device (hereunder sometimes referred to as a 
first conventional MIS type semiconductor device), as well 
as a method for producing such a conventional MIS type 
semiconductor device, will be described hereinbelow by 
referring to FIGS. 8 and 9. FIG. 8 is a sectional view of the first 
conventional MIS type semiconductor device. As illustrated 
in this figure, the first conventional MIS type 
semiconductor device consists of a gate oxidation film 132 
formed on a silicon substrate 131, a plurality of gate 
electrodes comprised of a gate-electrode polysilicon layer 
133 and connected in series with one another, a source 
diffusion layer 134 and a drain diffusion layer 135 which 
are formed in the silicon substrate 131, n-type diffusion 
layers 136 formed between the gate electrodes, an n-type 
diffusion layer 139 for forming a depletion type 
metal-oxide semiconductor (hereunder abbreviated as DMOS) 
channel, an insulation layer (hereunder sometimes referred 
to as an inter-layer insulation film) 137 and an aluminum 
wire 138. FIGS. 9(a) to 9(d) are sectional views of the first  
 
conventional MIS type semiconductor device for illustrating 
the method for producing the first conventional MIS type 
semiconductor device. Hereinafter, this method will be 
described by referring to these figures. First, as shown in FIG. 9(a), a photoresist mask
