<ABSTRACT>
The battery retaining system has a printed circuit 
board, a battery, and contact fittings. L-shaped contact 

fittings soldered to the backside of the circuit board hold 
battery electrode conducting tabs through slits in the 

circuit board. The battery is solidly retained with reliable 
electrical contact while minimizing the use of circuit board 

area. Spent batteries which are harmful to the environment 
can be easily removed and recycled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for retaining a 
battery on a printed circuit board inside battery driven 
electrical equipment such as an electric razor. Many compact electrical devices, such as the electric 
razor, which are powered by dry cells or rechargeable 
batteries have been known for some time. Electrical equipment 
driven by dry cell batteries are provided with a battery 
compartment allowing battery installation and removal to 
facilitate spent battery exchange. On the other hand, 
electrical equipment driven by rechargeable batteries are 
often assembled with internal rechargeable batteries, a 
rechargeable battery charging circuit, and AC plug blades for 
connecting to commercial power as a source of power for 
charging. This is done because rechargeable batteries can be 
used repeatedly with recharging. When rechargeable batteries 
in this type of electrical equipment become discharged as a 
result of driving the load, they can be recharged by 
inserting the AC plug blades into an electrical outlet 
without removing the batteries from inside the electrical 
equipment. Recharging renews the batteries to full charge 
able to again drive the electrical equipment. In this manner, 
since rechargeable batteries can be used repeatedly, there is 
no need to exchange batteries, no need to install or remove 
batteries, and the batteries can be permanently built-in to 
the electrical equipment. Therefore, the electrical equipment 
is easy to use and its structure is simplified since no 
battery compartment is required. Fig. 1 shows an oblique view of a rechargeable battery 
with conducting tabs 2 welded to its electrode regions, and  
 
Fig. 2 shows an oblique view of a rechargeable battery 
mounted on a printed circuit board. Part number 1 is a 
rechargeable nickel cadmium battery. This battery 1 is 
provided with a positive (+) and negative (-) electrode 
region, and a conducting tab 2 is spot welded to each 
electrode region. As mentioned previously, when the nickel 
cadmium battery is used in electrical equipment such as an 
electric razor, there is no need to remove or replace the 
battery 1 inside the electrical equipment. Therefore, the 
conducting tabs 2 can be soldered directly to the printed 
circuit board 3 housed within the electrical equipment. The 
conducting tabs 2 are made for the purpose of soldering to a 
printed circuit board 3. Space on the printed circuit board 3 
is allocated for the battery 1 and slits 4 through the board 
are provided for the conducting tabs 2 at both ends
