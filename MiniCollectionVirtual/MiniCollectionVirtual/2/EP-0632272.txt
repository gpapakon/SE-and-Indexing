<ABSTRACT>
Four embodiments of a reluctance type rotational speed 
sensor are disclosed. In the first embodiment, an 

annular magnet circumscribes a sensing coil having a 
unitary rotor nested within it, and is disposed between 

two elements which comprise the stator. In a second 
embodiment, a magnet is disposed between two halves which 

comprise a rotor, the entire assembly nesting within a 
sensing coil and being disposed between the two stator 

elements. In the third embodiment, the rotor carries 
multiple magnets in an axially opposed position with 

respect to teeth formed on the stator. The magnetic flux 
in the magnetic circuit increases and decreases as the 

rotor magnets alternate between aligned and non-aligned 
positions enabling measurement of angular speed in 

accordance with the increase and decrease of magnetic 
flux. Any of the first three embodiments may be used, 

with minor modifications, in environments where a 
rotating shaft turns within a stationary bore, or where a 

rotating bore turns about a stationary shaft. The fourth 
embodiment incorporates the features of the first three 

and further includes a caliper-like stator and coil 
assembly which may be removed for service without 

requiring extensive disassembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
Application Serial No. 071236,689, filed 8/24/88. This invention relates generally to rotational speed 
sensors, and more particularly to compact, unitary 
rotational speed sensors. Rotational speed sensors are used in many control 
and indicating systems. One frequently used type employs 
the variable reluctance principle. Common problems in 
such sensors in the prior art include constructing a 
device which will fit into compact spaces while 
maintaining close control over rotor-stator spacing, and 
providing sufficient output signal in terms of both 
signal amplitude and number of pulses per revolution. Prior art devices known to the inventors include 
those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,462,761 to 
3,480,812 to Hershberger; 3,596,122 to Stewart; 
3,604,966 to Liggett; 3,649,859 to Watt; 4,027,753 to 
Lantz; and 4,110,647 to Eslinger et al. In particular,  
 
the Hershberger device shows a nesting arrangement of 
rotor, magnet, coil and stator elements. Watt discloses 
a reluctance-type rotational speed sensor utilizing 
radially extending teeth on both stator and rotor. The 
Lantz device comprises a sealed system. None of the 
above-mentioned devises, however, combine the various 
teachings of the present invention to obtain a 
significantly more compact design that is capable of 
greater output levels, and versatile enough for use in 
many environments. The present rotational speed sensor improves upon 
prior art speed sensors by utilizing an axially compact 
design to obtain accurate measurements in a variety of 
environments. The flat, generally circular shape allows 
the sensor to measure the rotational speed of either a 
rotating shaft or a rotating bore. The sensor is 
designed to minimize the effects of eccentricities and 
unwanted relative movement between sensor components. 
For example, both radial runout and axial runout have 
minimal effect on the output of the sensor. Furthermore, 
the particular design of the magnetic circuit used by 
this sensor enables it to generate a high output signal 
for its size. The present speed sensor includes a rotor and a 
stator, each having teeth defining slots which act in  
 
conjunction with an annular magnet to increase and 
decrease magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit. The 
changes in flux generated by the rotor system induce 
alternating voltage in a coil of wire in a well known 
manner to produce signals representative of rotational 
speed. The first embodiment includes a coaxially nested 
rotor,
