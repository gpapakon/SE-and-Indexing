<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus A for sewing the opposed longitudinal 
edges 102 of a pair of fabric pieces 101 to a pair of stringer 

tapes 106 of a continuous slide fastener chain FC along the 
outer longitudinal edges of the stinger tapes 106 includes a 

support plate 9 for supporting thereon the fabric pieces 101 in 
parallel juxtaposition while the fabric pieces 101 are delivered 

to said sewing station 3, a pair of parallel juxtaposed edge 
folders 10 disposed longitudinally along a central portion of the 

support plate 9 and extending downstream toward the sewing 
station 3 for progressively folding over opposed longitudinal 

edges 102 of the fabric pieces 101 as the fabric pieces 101 are 
advanced along the corresponding edge folders 10, and an 

endless belt drive unit 11, disposed in confrontation with the 
edge folders 10 across the support plate 9 and having a pair of 

endless belts 27 frictionally engageable with a pair of parallel 
space portions, respectively, of the fabric pieces 101 extending 

parallel to the edge folders 10, for positively feeding the fabric 
pieces 101 toward the sewing station 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for folding
over the opposed longitudinal edges of a pair of fabric pieces or
paneis of an article and then sewing the folded longitudinal
edges of the panels to a continuous slide fastener chain along
the outer longitudinal edge of a pair of stringer tapes of the
slide fastener chain having a row of interengaged coupling
elements.In the manufacture of a slide fastener sewn to the
opposed longitudinal edges of a pair of fabric pieces or panels
of an article, such as left and right front panels of a garment, or
front and rear panels of a bag, the opposed longitudinal edges
of the panels are folded over and the thus folded longitudinal
edges of the panels are attached by sewing to the outer
longitudinal edges of a pair of stringer tapes of a continuous
slide fastener chain. Several examples of known apparatus
used for performing the above-mentioned sewing operation are
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2131250, 2977904, 3286669,
4674422, 4996933 and 5070799. It is common to all the
disclosed apparatus that a pair of parallel juxtaposed fabric
pieces or panels of an article and a continuous slide fastener
chain having a row of interengaged coupling elements are
supplied concurrently to a double needle sewing machine. The
sewing machine operates to attach the panels to the slide
fastener chain by sewing the opposed longitudinal edges of the
panels to the outer 
longitudinal edges of a pair of stringer tapes of the slide
fastener chain. An edge-folding means is disposed upstream of
the sewing machine and extends longitudinally along the path
of supply of the panels for progressively folding back the
opposed longitudinal edges of the panels as the panels are
advanced toward the sewing machine. With the edge-folding
means thus provided, the opposed longitudinal edges of the
panels are supplied in a folded condition to the sewing
machine. The thus folded longitudinal edges are then sewn to
the outer longitudinal edges of the stinger tapes by the sewing
machine.The edge-folding means generally has a pair of spiraled
or convoluted guide grooves extending from the upstream side
to the downstream side of the path of feed of the panels. At an
upstream end of the edge-folding means, the leading edges of
the respective panels are set such that opposed longitudinal
edges of the panels are received in the guide grooves. Then, the
panels are advanced toward the sewing machine. As the panel
advances, the opposed longitudinal edges received in the guide
grooves are bent downwards,

An apparatus A for sewing the opposed longitudinal
edges 102, 102', 102" of a pair of fabric pieces 101, 101', 101''

to a pair of stringer tapes 106 of a continuous slide fastener
chain FC along the outer longitudinal edges of the stringer tapes

106, the slide fastener chain FC including a row of interengaged
coupling elements 103, said apparatus A comprising: (a) a

sewing station 3 having a pair of laterally spaced sewing
needles 6 providing a pair of longitudinally extending rows of

stitches; (b) means 4 disposed upstream of said sewing station
3 for guiding the slide fastener chain FC longitudinally toward

said sewing station 3; and (c) means 5 disposed above said
guide means 4 for delivering the fabric pieces 101, 101', 101"

toward said sewing station 3 while holding the fabric pieces
101, 101', 101" in parallel juxtaposition, characterized in that

said delivering means 5 includes:

(i) a support plate 9 for supporting thereon the fabric
pieces 101, 101', 101" in parallel juxtaposition while the fabric

pieces 101, 101', 101" are delivered to said sewing station 3,
(ii) a pair of parallel juxtaposed edge folders 10 disposed
longitudinally along a central portion of said support plate 9
