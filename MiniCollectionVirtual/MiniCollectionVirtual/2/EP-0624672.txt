<ABSTRACT>
The device contains a part (7) co-rotating with the weaving rotor (2) and having reception channels (11) for the weft-thread feed and contains a part (8) stationary relative to the weaving rotor (2) and having connecting channels (10) for the weft-thread feed. Provided between the first and second parts (7, 8) are three supporting units (30) which form a three-point support and which keep the first and second parts (7, 8) at a distance from one another, in order to form a gap (9). As a result, advantageously, the friction between the first and second parts (7, 8) is reduced and, at the same time, the transfer and distribution of the weft threads are improved.

A device for the distribution of weft threads to weft 
ducts of the rotor of a series shed loom, which device 

comprises a first part (7) rotating with the rotor (2) 
and having a number of transfer ducts (11) for the weft 

thread supply and a second part (8) fixed with respect to 
the rotor and having a number of connecting ducts (10) 

for the weft thread supply, which via at least one 
rolling bearing (14) are disposed coaxially to one 

another and which are retained by means of energy storing 
devices (23) in an operating position,
characterised in that
 at least three support units (30) 
are provided, which form a three-point support in order 

to keep the first and second parts (7, 8) spaced apart 
and to create a gap (9),
and in that
 the support units (30) are adjustable in 
order to adjust the width of the gap (9). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 an arrangement is associated with 
each support unit (30) in order firstly to adjust the 

support unit (30) free from play and secondly to fix and 
to secure it in a predetermined position. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the support units (30) are 
connected in a rotationally secure manner to the first 

part (7). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the rolling bearing (14) is a cross 
roller bearing or a thin ring ball bearing in order to 

effect a play-free interaction of the first and second 
parts (7, 8).  

 
A series shed loom having an air-jet picking system and 
having a device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised by
 a mechanism for monitoring the width of 
the gap (9) between the first and second part (7, 8). 
A loom according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the mechanism comprises a sensor 
nozzle (43), which is disposed outside the connecting 

ducts (10) in the second part (8), through which an air 
stream discharges into the gap (9), a signal generator, 

which are in effective connection with the sensor nozzle 
(43), and indicating elements (46), which are connected 

to the signal generator (45), to indicate predetermined 
pressure states.
