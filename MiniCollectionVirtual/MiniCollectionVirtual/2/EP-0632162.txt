<CLAIMS>
Sheet which is non-forgeable by chemical
agents, comprising at least one forgeproof means, at

least one of these means consisting of a metal salt
combined with a co-reagent, characterized in that the

co-reagent is a compound chosen from those of the group
formed by:


organic acids chosen from carboxylic acids
containing at least two acid groups, sulphonic

acids and amino acids, as well as the salts of
these acids,
organic acid derivatives chosen from amides,
lactams, anhydrides and acid chlorides,
compounds with a reductive aldehyde function,
compounds with a reductive ketone function,
carbon dioxide precursors,
compounds comprising a phenolic structure being
excluded from this group.
Sheet according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the metal salt is chosen from cobalt II or III

salts and nickel salts, or mixtures thereof.
Sheet according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the metal salts are chosen from

the nitrates, sulphates and acetates, these salts being
anhydrous or hydrated.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the sulphonic acids or amino

acids comprise at least two acid groups.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the carboxylic acids are chosen 

from the group formed by malonic acid, glutaric acid,
phthalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid,

tricarballylic acid and trimellitic acid.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the anhydride is 2-sulphobenzoic

anhydride.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the amino acids are chosen from

glutamic acids and asparagines.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the compound containing a

reductive aldehyde function is butyraldehyde.
Sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the carbon dioxide precursors are

carbonates or bicarbonates, in particular sodium
carbonate or bicarbonate.
Non-forgeable document, characterized in that
it is obtained from a sheet according to one of the

preceding claims.
Use, as a co-reagent intended to improve the
sensitivity of a metal salt used as a forgeproof agent

for a sheet, of a product chosen from the family
consisting of:


organic acids chosen from carboxylic acids
containing at least two acid groups, sulphonic

acids and amino acids, as well as the salts of
these acids,
organic acid derivatives chosen from amides,
lactams, anhydrides and acid chlorides,
compounds with a reductive aldehyde function,
compounds with a reductive ketone function,
carbon dioxide precursors,
compounds comprising a phenolic structure being
excluded from this group.
Use according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the metal salt is a cobalt II or III salt or a

nickel salt or a mixture of these salts.
