<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method are disclosed for spinning filaments from a material such as cellulose acetate dope. The filaments are spun from a spinnerette at the top of a vertically elongated spinning cabinet. Gas is first directed parallel to the filaments as they are spun. A short distance down the cabinet, gas is directed radially inwardly toward the filaments. The two flows of gas merge and flow parallel to the filaments to the bottom of the cabinet, where the gas is withdrawn radially outwardly from the filaments.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SPINNING FILAMENTSTechnical FieldThis invention relates to apparatus and method for spinning filaments. It is especially suitable for spinning cellulose acetate dope into filaments which are used as tow for articles such as, for example, cigarette filters.Background of the InventionSynthetic yarn filaments are traditionally produced by melt, wet or dry spinning techniques, each being very well known in the art. For the production of cellulose acetate filaments, the dry spinning technique has been utilized quite successfully in the past. That is, a solution (usually called a "dope") comprising cellulose acetate and a volatile solvent therefor (usually acetone) is typically extruded through spinnerettes into a gaseous medium which serves to volatilize and evaporate the solvent thereby forming filaments of cellulose acetate. Usually multiple filaments are extruded, gathered into a tow and made into a filter rod, which is subsequently used for cigarette filters in a manner well known in the art. Spinning, 

volatilization and evaporation normally occur in a vertical chamber commonly referred to as a cabinet.At present, the gaseous medium is introduced into the spinning cabinets in such a way as to produce much turbulence and disturbance of the filament bundle which results in undesirable defects in the tow band. This invention discloses an apparatus and method to introduce and retrieve this warm process gas so as to minimize these defects and maximize the heat and mass transfer between the tow and process gas.Brief Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 is a schematic elevational view of the spinning cabinet according to this invention; Figure 2 is an enlarged elevational view in section showing details of the air feed means at the top of the cabinet and the air removal means at the bottom of the cabinet;Figure 3 is a section view along line 3—3 of Figure 2; andFigure 4 is a section view along line 4—4 of Figure 2. 

 Description of the InventionAccording to the present invention, there is provided a method of forming a filament bundle from a spinning solution comprising the steps of 5 a) providing a substantially enclosed, vertically elongated spinning cabinet with at least one spinnerette near the uppermost part thereof, b) spinning a multiplicity of filaments from a spinning solution through the spinnerette in a10 vertically downward direction, c) directing a first stream of warm gas in a downward direction around the filaments as they emerge from the spinnerette whereby solvent

CLAIMS
1. Method of forming a filament bundle from a spinning solution characterized as comprising the steps of a) providing a substantially enclosed, vertically elongated spinning cabinet with at least one spinnerette near the uppermost part thereof, b) spinning a multiplicity of filaments from a spinning solution through said spinnerette in a vertically downward direction, c) directing a first stream of warm gas in a downward direction around the filaments as they emerge from said spinnerette whereby solvent diffuses from within the filaments to the surfaces thereof and is volatilized, and whereby said filaments begin to individually solidify and strengthen, d) directing a second stream of warm gas radially inwardly and into said filament bundle at an entrance spaced an appreciable distance downward from said spinnerette, whereby diffusion and volatilization of solvent and solidification of the filaments is continued, e) removing both said first and second streams of warm gas at a position adjacent the exit of 


 said filaments from said cabinet in a generally radial outward direction, and f) providing a pressure differential between the top and bottom of said cabinet to maintain the flow of gas in a downward direction.
2. Method according to Claim 1 wherein said spinning solution is cellulose acetate dope.
3. Method according to Claim 1 wherein said spinning solution is cellulose acetate dissolved in acetone.
4. Method according to Claim 1 wherein said gas is air.
5. Method according to Claim 1 wherein said first and second streams of warm gas contain volatilized solvent at the point of removal from said cabinet, said method further comprising the steps of separating at least a portion of solvent from said gas and recirculating at least a portion of said gas as said first and second streams.
'
 6. Apparatus for forming a filament bundle from a spinning solution characterized as comprising 


a) a substantially enclosed, vertically elongated spinning cabinet having at least one spinnerette at the uppermost part thereof, b) means for spinning a multiplicity of filaments from a spinning solution from said spinnerette in a vertically downward direction, c) means for directing a first stream of warm gas in a downward direction around the filaments as they emerge from said spinnerette whereby solvent diffuses from within the filaments to the surfaces thereof and is volatilized, and whereby said filaments begin to individually solidify and strengthen, d) means for directing a second stream of warm gas radially inwardly and into said filament bundle at an entrance spaced an appreciable distance downward from said spinnerette whereby diffusion and volatilization of solvent and solidification of the filaments is continued, e) means for removing both said first and second streams of warm gas at a position adjacent the exit of said filaments from said cabinet in a generally radial outward direction, and f) means providing a pressure differential between the top and bottom of said cabinet to 


 maintain the flow of gas in a downward direction.
7. Apparatus according to Claim 6 wherein said means for directing a first stream of warm gas, said means for directing a second stream of gas and said means for removing both said first and second streams of gas each comprise a cylindrical perforated plate for causing a substantially even flow of said gas around said filaments.
