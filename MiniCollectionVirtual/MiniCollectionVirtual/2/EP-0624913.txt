<ABSTRACT>
A lithium secondary battery comprises a natural 
graphite as a negative electrode capable of occluding and 

discharging lithium ion, in which the natural graphite has 
been heat treated at a temperature of at least 1,800°C. The 

heat treatment removes impurities from natural graphite. As 
a result, the electrolyte solution used for the battery 

hardly decomposes during charge and discharge and self 
discharge hardly occurs during storage of the battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary 
battery and, more specifically to an improvement of the negative 
electrode material used therefor to achieve better cycle 
characteristics and storage capability. In recent years, lithium secondary batteries utilizing 
nonaqueous electrolytes have become spotlighted because of 
a possible high-voltage design without taking decomposition 
voltage of water into consideration, thus differing from 
water-based secondary batteries utilizing aqueous 
electrolyte solutions, such as nickel-cadmium batteries. Metallic lithium has been used as the negative 
electrode material of these lithium secondary batteries. In 
recent years, however, it has been pointed out that metallic 
lithium causes poor cycle characteristics due to the growth of 
dendritic deposits of lithium. Carbon materials, that occlude 
and discharge lithium ion solely during charge and discharge 
and have no such problem, and now studied as 
replacement of metallic lithium. Among these carbon 
materials, natural graphite having particularly high 
crystallinity and a large discharge capacity of 370 mAh/g, 
is one of the most promising negative electrode materials. However, natural graphite, being a natural product,  
 
contains in the crystals thereof impurities such as bound 
water and active terminal groups. These impurities react, 
during charge or discharge or during storage, with the 
electrolyte solution used to decompose and degrade it, 
whereby lithium secondary batteries with a negative 
electrode of natural graphite have had the problem of poor 
cycle characteristics and storage characteristics. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a lithium secondary battery with a negative 
electrode of natural graphite having excellent cycle 
characteristics and storage characteristics. The present invention provides a lithium secondary 
battery (hereinafter referred to as "the battery of the 
present invention") comprising natural graphite as a 
negative electrode capable of occluding and discharging 
lithium ion, said natural graphite having been heat treated 
at a temperature of at least 1800°C. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many 
of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained 
as the same become better understood by reference to the 
following detailed description when considered in connection 
with the accompanying drawings, wherein:
