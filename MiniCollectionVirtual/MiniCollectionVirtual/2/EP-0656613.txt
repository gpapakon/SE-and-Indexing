<ABSTRACT>
A novel motion generator is presented for motion simulation of a person (20), placed in front of a virtual environment (surroundings) generated by a viewing system (10), within the virtual environment, which motion generator has an actuator (control member) which can be actuated by the person (20) and supplies control signals to the viewing system (10) according to the desired motion, which viewing system generates thereafter a visible image of the virtual environment, which corresponds to the eye point or the viewing angle of the person (20) which moves in a simulated manner. In order to shorten the learning phase for the correct actuation of the actuator, while keeping the hands of the person (20) free at the same time, the actuator has a sensor (14) which is subject to the body displacement of the person (20) placed in front of the viewing system (10) and a two-dimensional path or force pickup (sensor) (15) which is connected to the sensor (14) and whose output signals form the control signals.

Motion generator for simulated motion, within a virtual
environment, of a person (20) positioned in front of that

virtual environment which is generated by a visual system
(10), with a control element to be operated by the person

(20) which outputs control signals according to the
desired motion to the visual system (10) which then

generates a visual image of the virtual environment
according to the eye point of the person (20) whose

motion is being simulated, characterised in that the
control element has a sensor (14) which is mechanically

subjected to the body displacement of the person (20) who
is positioned at a fixed place in front of the visual

system (10) and who wishes to begin moving forwards,
sideways or backwards, and a two-dimensional detector of

displacement or force (15) which is coupled to that
sensor and whose output signals form the control signals.
Motion generator according to Claim 1 characterised in
that the sensor (14) consists of a ring (16) which

surrounds approximately horizontally the body or legs,
preferably in the thigh region, of the person (20) at a

radial distance and which is kept in a neutral position
by means of restoring devices (18) and is arranged so as

to be radially deflectable in the horizontal plane
against the force of the restoring devices (18).
Motion generator according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the restoring devices consist of springs (18) or

rubber-elastic buffers which, offset by equal angles at
the circumference, act externally on the ring (16) in the

radial direction.
Motion generator according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the ring (16) is attached to a frame structure (17)

via the springs (18) or the rubber-elastic buffers. 
Motion generator according to one of the Claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the ring (16) has a circular or

elliptical shape.
Motion generator according to one of the Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that the ring (16) is divided into two

ring-sections (161, 162) which are hinged to one another
at one of their joints and releasably locked at their

other joint.
