<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for collecting waste, in particular waste packing glass comprising at least one intake container and at least one collecting container (1) and a lifting device (15) for raising an intake container into a discharging position above the collecting container (20), wherein the intake container comprises a bottom part (2) and a bottomless housing (3) part fitting thereon and provided with waste intake openings (4) that is movable relative to the bottom part between a closed position in which a lower edge of the housing part lies sealingly against the bottom and an open position in which the lower edge is situated at a distance from the bottom part, wherein a lifting-engaging member (16) for the lifting device is connected to the bottom part and the collecting container comprises a lifting device (25, 26) engaging on a lifting-engaging member (30) connected to the housing part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for collecting 
waste, comprising at least one intake container having a 
bottom part and a bottomless housing part fitting thereon 
and provided with waste intake openings that is movable 
relative to the bottom part between a closed position in 
which a lower edge of the housing part lies sealingly 
against the bottom and an open position in which the lower 
edge is situated at a distance from the bottom part, first 
engaging means for first lifting means being connected to 
the bottom part and second engaging means for second lifting 
means being connected to the housing part. Such a device is known from AU-B-559326. In the 
present day trend of separated collection of different kinds 
of waste material, on each collecting point a number of 
intake containers are positioned, each for a different kind 
of waste material. Each of these containers has to be 
emptied separately, so as to avoid mixing of the separated 
waste materials. Furthermore, the separate intake containers 
take up a lot of space and for the persons discarding the 
waste materials it is cumbersome to walk back and forth 
between the different containers for getting rid of their 
waste materials, and this is not inducive for stimulating 
the desired separate collection of the waste. The invention has for its object to provide a 
device of the kind set forth above with which these 
disadvantages are eliminated. This object is achieved with the device according 
to the invention as characterized in claim 1. Different 
sorts of waste can now be collected in the different 
compartments of one and the same intake container. 
Particularly, when used for waste packing glass, a separate 
compartment can be formed for each type of glass, in 
particular for each colour. During emptying the different  
 
compartments are positioned by the aligning means above the 
different compartments of the collecting container, so that 
the different types of waste, in particular different types 
of glass, also fall into the separate compartments of the 
collecting container. A favourable embodiment is characterized in claim 
2. The intake container can be positioned at a random 
location in lengthwise direction of the rails so that the 
collecting container can be evenly filled. The rails 
simultaneously form the aligning means. A simple embodiment is characterized therein in 
claim 3. Application of the step of claim 4 achieves that 
the waste thrown into the intake container falls entirely 
and without leaving remnants

<CLAIMS>
Device for collecting waste, in particular 
waste glass packing, comprising at least one intake 

container (1) having a bottom part (2) and a bottomless 
housing part (3) fitting thereon and provided with waste 

intake openings (4) that is movable relative to the bottom 
part (2) between a closed position in which a lower edge of 

the housing part (3) lies sealingly against the bottom (2) 
and an open position in which the lower edge is situated at 

a distance from the bottom part (2), first engaging means 
(15) for first lifting means being connected to the bottom 

part (2) and second engaging means (30) for second lifting 
means (25) being connected to the housing part (3),
characterized in that
 the bottom part (2) comprises at least 
one vertical transverse wall (5, 6) lying sealingly against 

the walls of the housing part (3) and dividing the intake 
container (1) into compartments each provided with its own 

intake openings (4), in that the device further comprises a 
collecting container (20) provided with a corresponding 

number of transverse walls (21, 22) and having aligning 
means (23) for positioning the intake container (1) relative 

to the collecting container (20) such that the transverse 
wall(s) (5, 6) thereof lies or lie substantially in the same 

plane as the corresponding transverse wall(s) (21, 22) of 
the collecting container (20), said aligning means (23) 

comprising guide surfaces which facilitate positioning of 
the intake container (1) thereon and support surfaces for 

supporting said intake container. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
aligning means comprises two rails (23) which are disposed 

at a distance parallel to each other and to the transverse 
wall(s) (21, 22) of the collecting container, each of which 

can be moved upward by the second lifting means formed by a  
 

number of hydraulic cylinders (25) and wherein each intake 
container (1) has on two opposite sides, along the lower 

edge, parts (30) protruding outside the bottom part (2) and 
co-acting with the rails (23) and forming the second 

engaging means. 
Device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the rails 
(23) are formed by angle irons each having a leg directed 

towards the other angle iron. 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing 
claims, wherein the intake container (1) has internally an 

approximately pyramid-shaped bottom (7). 
Device as claimed in any of the foregoing 
claims, wherein the housing part (3) of the intake container 

(1) is movably connected to the bottom part (2) by a 

vertical slide guide (9). 
Device as claimed in claim 5, wherein the first 
engaging member is a rod-like member extending slidably over 

a distance through the slide guide (9) and protruding above 
the housing part and provided at its bottom end with a stop 

(16) which in the extended position engages the bottom (2).
