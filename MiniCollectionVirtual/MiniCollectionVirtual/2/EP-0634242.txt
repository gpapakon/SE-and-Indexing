<ABSTRACT>
A punch-type cutter for cutting a workpiece into substantially 
rectangular pieces is provided which comprises a pair of 

jaw members adapted to be opened and closed about a pivot shaft. 
Each of the jaw members includes, attached thereto, a cutting 

blade on an abutting surface thereof, the cutting blades being of 
a substantially U-shaped configuration. The cutting blades are 

arranged to be inter-engaged with each other with one of the 
cutting blades being positioned within the other of the cutting 

blades, so that a workpiece positioned between the cutting blades 
may be cut to form cutout pieces of a substantially rectangular 

configuration. A protrusion is disposed within one of the cutting 
blades. The protrusion extends to a point outwardly of the 

cutting plane of the one cutting blade. A through hole of a 
substantially rectangular configuration in a horizontal cross-section 

is formed within the other of the cutting blades. The 
through hole permits discharge of the cutout pieces therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punch-type cutter to
cut structural members of buildings, vehicles, marines boats or
the like into rectangular cutout pieces for de-construction of
such buildings or the like.A shearing machine including a pair of linear blades
connected for scissor-like movement is usually employed to de-construct
structural members of buildings, vehicles, marine boats
or the like. It is noted, however, that, when such a shearing
machine is used to cut a structural member or workpiece having a
length larger than that of its blades, it is difficult to completely
cut such structural member along it entire length due to
the interference between the blades and the structural member.
In order to avoid this problem, a punch-type cutter has been
proposed which comprises a pair of jaw members having, in their
abutting surface, a cutting blade of a substantially U-shaped
configuration (refer to Japanese Patent Publication No. 05(1993)-3224).
This cutter is capable of cutting a workpiece into a
small pieces of a rectangular configuration, so that the blades
can be easily advanced. Further, such small pieces of a rectangular
configuration have substantially constant dimensions and
weight, so that they may be easily handled and recycled.It is noted, however, that the above punch-type cutter
has a problem in that rectangular cutout pieces may remain between 
the jaw members. Accordingly, such cutter requires sweeping
operation to remove cutout pieces from the abutting surface of
the jaw members after each cutting operation, since no discharge
mechanism for such cutout pieces is provided. Such sweeping
operation is performed, for example, by opening the jaw members,
after completion of cutting work, and by shaking the cutter.
Such sweeping operation is of course time-consuming and wearisome.A punch-type cutter provided with a discharge mechanism
for cutout pieces has been proposed (refer to Japanese Patent
Publication No. 05(1993)-3224). The discharge mechanism includes
a steel plate connected through springs to an abutting surface of
one of the jaw members, the plate serving to displace cutout
pieces outwardly from the jaw member. Specifically, the springs
disposed between the plate and the one of the jaw member are
compressed when the jaw member are closed. When the jaw members
are opened, the thus compressed springs extend to urge the steel
plate outwardly, so as to displace the remaining cutout pieces
out of the jaw member. It is to be noted that such discharge
mechanism is not preferable since

<CLAIMS>
A punch-cutter comprising:

a pair of jaw members (4,5)

adapted to be opened and closed,

about a pivot shaft (6),
and with respective cutter blades (14, 20),

of substantially U-shaped, co-operatively inter-fitting, configuration,

to produce a workpiece (25) cut-out portion (26),
a jaw through hole (11),

of substantially rectangular configuration

in horizontal cross-section,
for cut-out portion discharge,

upon workpiece penetration and severance;
characterized by
a protrusion (23) upon one jaw, disposed within the jaw cutting
blades, and extending to a point outwardly of the blade cutting

plane, and locatable in the through hole (11) of another jaw;
the protrusion (23) comprising a series of blocks (22a-22c), of
triangular cross-section, and wave-like longitudinal side profile,

as an in-fill to the associated blade span, and
being disposed, in relation to the cutter blades, to engage a
prospective cut-out portion upon initial jaw closure, somewhat

before workpiece blade contact, and progressively to deform
the prospective cut-out portion, about workpiece blade contact,

whilst still entrained with the workpiece;
the through hole (11) having a flared exit mouth (18), to promote
discharge therefrom of a pre-deformed cut-out portion, as a

discrete, unitary, element, upon severance from the workpiece,
by co-operative blade interaction.
A punch-cutter

as claimed in Claim 1,

wherein one jaw member of a pair is stationary,

while the other is relatively movable,

by an interconnecting actuator cylinder.
A punch-cutter

as claimed in Claim 2,

wherein a piston rod of said actuator cylinder

is pivotably connected to said stationary jaw member,

and the actuator cylinder

is pivotably connected to said movable jaw member,

at a position rearwardly of said pivot shaft.
