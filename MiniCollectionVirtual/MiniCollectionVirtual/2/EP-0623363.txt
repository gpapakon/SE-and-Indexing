<ABSTRACT>
A feedthrough filter capacitor assembly (10) and 
related installation method are provided for 

shielding a conductive terminal pin or lead (12) of the 
type used, for example, in an implantable medical 

device such as a heart pacemaker or defibrillator, 
against passage of external interference signals. 

The feedthrough assembly (10) includes a terminal pin 
subassembly (26) having at least one terminal pin (12) 

supported within a cylindrical conductive ferrule (28) by 
a hermetically sealed insulator ring (30). The ferrule (28) is 

adapted for mounting onto a conductive pacemaker 
housing (22), as by welding or brazing, to support the 

terminal pin (12) for feedthrough passage to the housing 
interior. A co-axial filter capacitor (24) is mounted at 

an inboard side of the pacemaker housing (22), with 
capacitor electrode plate sets (40,42) coupled respectively 

to the pacemaker housing (22) and to the terminal pin (12) by a 
conductive adhesive (54) or the like. In one preferred 

form, multiple filter capacitors are provided in a 
substantially coplanar array within a common base 

structure, with each capacitor in association with a 
respective terminal pin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
improvements in feedthrough terminal pin assemblies
and related methods of installation, particularly of
the type used in implantable medical devices such as
heart pacemakers and the like to decouple undesired
interference signals from the device. More
specifically, this invention relates to an improved
feedthrough terminal pin and capacitor assembly and
related installation method, including one or more
filter capacitors, and adapted particularly for use
in connecting a lead wire or electrode through a
hermetically sealed housing to internal electronic
components of the medical device while decoupling
interference signals against entry into the sealed
housing. The invention is particularly designed for
use in heart pacemakers (bradycardia), defibrillators
(tachycardia), and combined pacemaker defibrillator
devices.Feedthrough terminal pin assemblies are
generally known in the art for connecting electrical
signals through the housing or case of an electronic
instrument. For example, in implantable medical
devices especially such as a heart pacemaker or
defibrillator or the like, the terminal pin assembly
comprises one or more conductive terminal pins 
supported by an insulator structure for feedthrough
passage from the exterior to the interior of the
medical device. Many different insulator structures
and related mounting methods are known in the art for
use in medical devices wherein the insulator
structure also provides a hermetic seal to prevent
entry of body fluids into the housing of the medical
device. However, the feedthrough terminal pins are
connected to one or more lead wires which effectively
act as an antenna and thus tend to collect stray or
electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals for
transmission to the interior of the medical device.
In some prior art devices, the medical device has
included ceramic chip capacitors which have been
added to the internal electronics of the device in an
effort to filter and thus control the effects of such
interference signals. This internal, so-called
"on-board" filtering technique has potentially
serious disadvantages due to intrinsic parasitic
resonances of the chip capacitors, in combination
with permitting EMI entry into the interior of the
device housing. In another and normally preferred
approach. A filter capacitor has been combined
directly with the terminal pin assembly to decouple
interference signals to the housing of the medical
device.In a typical construction, a coaxial
feedthrough filter capacitor used
