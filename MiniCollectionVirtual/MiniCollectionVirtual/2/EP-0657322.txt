<ABSTRACT>
Control method for a vehicle with electrical propulsion and with a clutchless transmission mechanism (9), of the type including an electric motor (2) actuated by a central control unit (3) as a function of commands given by the driver, characterised in that it consists in recognising the fact that the vehicle has entered stop phase and, as soon as this recognition has occurred, in automatically activating drive of the motor (2) so as to move the vehicle at a substantially constant speed, and to do this for as long as the contact powering the vehicle has not been cut or the forward/reverse selector of the vehicle has not been engaged in the neutral position, or else that the handbrake has not been actuated.
