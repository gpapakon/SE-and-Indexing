<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) having high HFP content and end-of-melting temperature, Tm(end), as low as 200  C are disclosed. Exceptional performance as a processing aid in polyolefins results from having Tm(end) of the TFE/HFP copolymer close to the processing temperature of the polyolefin. These TFE/HFP copolymers are soluble in fluorinated cyclic solvents. Copolymer/solvent systems copolymer at significant concentrations in selected solvents are fluid and stable at room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of partially-crystalline 
tetrafluoroethylene copolymers having unusually low crystalline 
melting temperatures, which makes them useful in solution form and as 
aids for the extrusion processing of polyolefins, including polyolefins 
incorporating antiblock agents. Homopolymers of TFE are crystalline or partially-crystalline 
fluoroplastics. Copolymerization with other monomers that introduce 
side groups into the polymer affects the properties of the polymers. 
Generally, at low levels of comonomer incorporation, both melting 
temperature Tm and crystallinity decrease with increasing comonomer 
content. Crystallinity is reflected, for example, by the heat of fusion per 
unit mass as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). At 
high levels of comonomer incorporation, all detectable crystallinity may 
vanish. If the monomers and their concentrations are properly chosen, 
and molecular weight is properly controlled, useful fluoroelastomers or 
fluoroplastics may be obtained. For example, the TFE copolymer with 
perfluoro (methyl vinyl) ether (PMVE) in the approximate molar 
composition TFE/PMVE = 70/30 is a well-known fluoroelastomer. On 
the other hand, copolymers of TFE with HFP or perfluoro (propyl vinyl) 
ether (PPVE) in the approximate molar compositions TFE/HFP = 92/8 
and TFE/PPVE = 98.5/1.5 are well-known fluoroplastics. These 
particular perfluoroplastics have nominal Tm of about 260°C and 305°C, 
respectively, as judged by the peak of the melting endotherm by DSC. 
See Figure 1. The minimum Tm(peak) for fluoroplastics in these 
compositional families recognized by ASTM standards is 250°C for 
TFE/HFP polymers (ASTM D-2116) and 300°C for TFE/PPVE polymers 
(ASTM D-3307). Such fluoroplastics have had commercial utility in part 
because of their relatively high Tm and the mechanical properties that 
accompany the level of crystallinity associated with relatively low 
comonomer incorporation.  
 Partially-crystalline polymers are those which exhibit crystallinity 
under some conditions, as opposed to those polymers which are 
non-crystalline under all conditions. A partially-crystalline polymer 
typically exhibits crystallinity as polymerized, or after fabrication when 
the melted polymer is cooled slowly enough to permit development of 
molecular order. As is well-known, quenching from the melt can reduce 
or even preclude crystalline order in a specimen of a partially-crystalline 
polymer. The resultant quenched polymer is nevertheless considered
