<ABSTRACT>
This method of forming a product integrally with a surface 
layer material achieves to use a single forming die capable of 

vacuum forming and urethane forming and to require no 
preheating step before vacuum forming, by employing a surface 

layer material (2) having a sufficient shapability at an urethane 
forming temperature and an urethane base (1) which can endure 

residual stress caused by elogation of the surface layer 
material after vacuum forming. Thus, the product can be 

manufactured at a low cost. First, a surface layer material (2) 
which comprises a synthetic resin having a 30% modulus of 0.1 

to 2.0 kg/cm is placed at a forming die (a first die (3)) which 
is capable of vacuum forming and urethane forming, and vacuum 

formed into a predetermined shape. Second, a liquid urethane 
raw material which becomes an urethane base (1) having a maximum 

bending load of 30N or more after forming is introduced into a 
cavity of the forming die (3) and solidified, thereby formed into 

the urethane base (1) integrally with the surface layer material 
(2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming a 
product integrally with a surface layer, and more particularly, 
to a method of forming a product in which a surface layer 
material is integrally formed on the surface of an urethane 
base, and to the product obtained thereby. This product 
according to the present invention can be suitably used as 
automotive interior component parts such as door trims, arm 
rests, and instrument panel garnishes. Conventionally, a product formed integrally with a surface 
layer material in which a surface layer material composed of a 
synthetic resin such as a polyvinyl chloride sheet is 
integrally formed on the surface of an urethane base composed 
of hard or semi-hard urethane foam has been used as an 
automotive interior component part, for example, a door trim. This product is formed by using a vacuum forming die and 
an urethane forming die, as shown in process drawings of Figure 
6. In the conventional forming method, first, a surface layer 
material 80 composed of a synthetic resin such as a polyvinyl  
 
chloride sheet is heated to about 140 to 150°C by a heater 81 
and softened. Second, the softened surface layer material 80 is 
set at a vacuum forming die 82 having a die surface in a 
predetermined shape, and drawn down into close contact with 
that die surface by vacuum and formed in a predetermined shape. 
After the shaped surface layer material 80 is removed from the 
vacuum forming die 82 and cooled down, the surface layer 
material 80 is set at a shaped die surface of an urethane 
forming die 83 which is controlled at an urethane forming 
temperature (about 60 to 100°C in general). Then, a liquid 
urethane raw material is introduced into a cavity of the 
urethane forming die 83 and solidified, thereby forming an 
urethane base comprising hard or semi-hard urethane foam 
integrally with the surface layer material 80. Thus, a product 
formed integrally with a surface layer is obtained. As described in the above, the conventional method of 
forming a product integrally with a surface layer employs two 
forming dies consisting of the vacuum forming die 82 and the 
urethane forming die 83, and, in addition, needs to preheat 
the surface layer material 80 before vacuum forming. Therefore, 
both the cost of forming dies and the number of processing 
steps are increased, which inevitably increases the production 
costs of the product. The reason why the surface layer material 
80 is preheated to be softened beforehand is to render a 
predetermined shape
