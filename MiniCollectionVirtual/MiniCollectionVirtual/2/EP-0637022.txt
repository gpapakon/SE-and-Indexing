<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive in which the disk spindle motor for a rotatable 
recording/reproducing media has a printed circuit stator winding (9b1) on a 

printed circuit board (9b3) within the disk drive housing (1) fitted between 
axially spaced circular flanges (9a4, 9a5) of a bobbin-shaped motor rotor (9a). 

Alternately poled, equally circumferential spaced, axial magnetic fields between 
the axially spaced circular flanges link radially disposed printed circuit winding 

sections (9b11). Electronic elements (15d-17) on the printed circuit board (9b3) 
are linked internally of the housing with the magnetic head (5b1) and the 

actuator motor winding (5e1) which powers the actuator (5) for moving the 
magnetic head (5b1) to different radial locations on the rotatable media (7a). 

Bi-polar energization of the stator winding (9b1) of the disk spindle motor (3) is 
under the control of a commutating circuit (9b4) controlled by a Hall sensor 

(9b18) linked by the axial permanent magnet fields. Motor speed control is 
achieved by controlling the voltage level of the commutating circuit (9b4) or by 

controlling the duty cycle of the voltage coupled to the stator winding (9b1). 
The disk drive design integrates the printed circuit assembly (9b3) with the disk 

spindle motor (3) and the electronics (15d-17) of the printed circuit assembly 
(9b3) within the disk drive housing (1) which reduces the disk drive profile and 

eliminates elaborate feed through connections with an external printed circuit 
assembly. The use of an axial gap disk spindle motor (3), integrated with a disk 

drive base (1), and provided with a printed circuit winding (9b1), reduces the 
disk spindle motor profile and brings the printed circuit assembly (9b3) inside the 

disk drive housing, eliminating the additional increment of the profile normally 
consumed by the printed circuit assembly. These cumulative reductions in 

structural profile reduce the overall profile of the memory disk structure in the 
disk drive, increasing the mechanical volumetric efficiency of the disk drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disk recording/reproducing devices and more
particularly to such devices of a structural design which simplifies the
fabrication of parts, and sub-assemblies, simplifies assembly, increases product
yield, reduces product costs, and, importantly, embodies structural design
features which increase mechanical volumetric efficiency by functionally
integrating parts which are conventionally, physically separated in an assembly
stack and thereby not functionally related to reduce the profile of the device.US-A-5 124 863 discloses a recording/reproducing device having the
precharacterising features of appended claim 1.Recording/reproducing devices typically comprise a rotatable disk
media structure which includes a disk powered by a disk spindle motor, and, an
actuator structure which comprises a transducer/actuator arm assembly on a
movable support and powered by an actuator motor, for moving the transducer
radially of the disk. The actuator may be either of the rotary or linear type and
functions under servo controlled actuator motor power to move the transducer
to different radial positions on a disk. In a disk drive this mode of operation is
referred to as a track seeking and track following operation.In a disk drive, the memory disk structure comprises one or more
disks in a memory disk assembly, concentrically mounted about a disk spindle
hub which is driven by a radial gap disk spindle motor having a stator mounted
to the base of the disk drive housing. In the memory disk assembly, one or
more disks are clamped in a stack about the disk spindle hub, multiple disks
being axially spaced by ring spacers of sufficient thickness to space the disks to
clear individual actuator structures therebetween. The stator of the disk spindle 
motor is assembled within the disk spindle hub. The disk spindle hub functions
as the motor rotor.As disk drives are reduced in size, such motor designs in the memory
disk structure become impractical in both radial and axial dimension. As the
radius is reduced adequate motor torque is no longer available. Design efforts
to increase motor torque by increasing the radius of the motor and reducing the
axial dimension, have resulted in radial gap disk spindle motors having relatively
thin-flat, rotors of sufficient diameter so that motor torque requirements may be
met. The stator structure with its windings is disposed within the motor rotor.
