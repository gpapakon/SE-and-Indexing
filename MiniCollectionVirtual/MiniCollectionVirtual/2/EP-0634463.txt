<ABSTRACT>
A brighter white opacified paint, which contains a 
conventional film-forming polymer together with a 

conventional optical brightener and particles anatase 
titanium dioxide and/or zinc sulphide as the white 

opacifier. Unlike the rutile form of titanium dioxide, the 
anatase form or zinc sulphide enables the optical 

brightener to function usefully in the presence of the 
white opacifier especially when the amount of optical 

brightener present is not more than 10 micromoles/g of the 
non-volatiles content of the paint. Preferably the 

particles are encapsulated in polymer or attached to a 
discontinuous polymer barrier comprising particles of 

organic polymer in order to space them apart and improve 
opacity. A small amount of fluorescence is also obtainable 

from chloride-produced rutile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to paints containing white 
opacifier and having improved brightness. The paints are 
suitable for application at ambient temperatures (i.e. 0 to 
40Â°C) to surfaces of the type found on buildings or their 
fittings or furnishings. White opacifiers are pigments 
which enable a dried coat of paint to hide marks on the 
surface to which the coat has been applied. If colours 
other than white are wanted, the white opacifier will be 
used in combination with other pigments or dyes which 
impart the wanted colour. The invention is especially 
useful with paints which dry to give matt or silk (i.e. 
mid-sheen) finishes of the type popular for painting walls 
and ceilings, and it is particularly beneficial in white 
paints and paints of a light pastel shade. Silk paints 
usually contain from 8 to 15% by volume of white opacifier 
whilst matt paints usually contain from 11 to 20% by 
volume. Apart from white lead (now regarded as too poisonous 
for general use), zinc sulphide was probably the earliest  
 
modern white opacifying pigment. It was then largely 
displaced by the titanium dioxides which have higher 
opacifying powers. Two forms of titanium dioxide have been used 
commercially in paints and the like. They are anatase and 
rutile. Both were made by the sulphate process as 
described in Volume 3 of the third edition of Kirk-Othmer's 
"Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology" published in 1983 by 
John Wiley & Sons of New York, see pages 145 to 148. 
Anatase was the first form to become commercially 
available, possibly because lower temperatures are used in 
its manufacture. However, rutile has the higher density 
and refractive index and so is more effective as an 
opacifier. It is often said that rutile can be around 
30% more effective as an opacifier than anatase. The early availability of anatase meant that it was 
the form of titanium dioxide originally used in paints. 
However, during the 1940's sulphate-produced rutile became 
available and its greater effectiveness as an opacifier 
meant that it began to displace anatase from paints. Both 
forms of titanium dioxide can promote the degradation of 
many of the organic film-forming polymers used in paints, 
but during the 1950's it was discovered that this 
degradation could be substantially reduced by coating 
rutile with up to as much as 20 wt% of hydratable inorganic 
oxides such as alumina silica, zirconia and/or tin oxide. 
Accordingly, during the 1950's, coated sulphate-produced 
rutile displaced anatase from paints
