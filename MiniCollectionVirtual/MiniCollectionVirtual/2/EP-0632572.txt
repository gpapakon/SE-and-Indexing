<ABSTRACT>
The efficiency of a reluctance motor is enhanced, the noises and vibrations are reduced, and the cost, size 
and weight are reduced. For the reciprocating energization of the armature coil, one end of the coil of each phase, 

and the other are connected to the switching elements on the anode and cathode side through diodes connected in the 
forward direction. By this arrangement, the number of the switching elements required is reduced to half the number 

of switching elements of a conventional one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a current supply
control circuit for a reluctance motor designed to supply
the armature coils with armature current flowing in both
forward and backward directions.A reluctance motor with a fixed armature having a
magnetic pole wound repeatedly with armature coils of
plural phases will be explained hereinafter with respect
to current supply to the armature coils. In the
following explanation, angles without any special
comments are electric angles.Furthermore, in the following description, the terms
"one direction" may be replaced with the terms "forward
direction" or "going direction", while the term "the
other direction" may be replaced with the term "reverse
direction" or "returning direction".Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing a fixed
armature and a rotor. Rotors 1, each formed by
laminating electromagnetic steel sheets, are equipped
with salient poles 1a, 1b, each having a width of 180
degrees (= 90 degrees in terms of mechanical angle), and
are mutually spaced with phase difference of 360 degrees.
A rotational shaft 2 is provided at a center of the rotor
1. The arrow A indicates a rotational direction of the
rotor 1.A fixed armature 3, similarly formed by laminating
electromagnetic steel sheets, has an inside surface
provided with uniformly spaced 12 slots 3a, 3b, 3c,---, 
and is fixed to a frame member 4.The slots 3a, 3d are respectively wound with one
coil, while the slots 3g, 3j are respectively wound with
another coil. To constitute a 1st-phase armature coil,
these two coils are connected with each other in series
or in parallel, although they are connected in series in
this embodiment.The slots 3b, 3e are wound with one coil, while the
slots 3h, 3k are wound with another coil. These two
coils are connected with each other in series, thus
constituting a 2nd-phase armature coil.The slots 3c, 3f are wound with one coil, while the
slots 3i, 3l are wound with another coil. These two
coils are connected with each other in series, thus
constituting a 3rd-phase armature coil.Fig. 2 is a development showing the rotor 1, a
rotational plate 15 detecting the position of rotor 1,
and armature coils.In Fig. 2, armature coils 5a and 5d represent the
previously-described 1st-phase armature coil. Armature
coils 5b and 5e represent the previously-described 2nd-phase
armature coil. Armature coils 5c and 5f represent
the previously-described 3rd-phase armature coil. Lead
terminals of 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-phase armature coils are
denoted by reference numerals 6a, 6b and 6c, 6d
