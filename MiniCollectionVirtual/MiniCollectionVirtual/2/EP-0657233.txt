A rolling process for the manufacture of a pulley (1) 
having a plurality of V-shaped peripheral grooves (6) in 

which a circular semi-finished product is subjected to 
successive steps of plastic deformation carried out by 

implements (20) each having a pair of rolls (22, 23) 
operating simultaneously on the same peripheral portion 

of the semi-finished product and a pivoted fork (21) 
supporting the rolls (22, 23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rolling process for 
the manufacture of pulleys having at least one V-shaped 
peripheral groove, and also a rolling implement. In the known processes, pulleys of the said type are 
manufactured by successive rolling steps: more 
particularly, the cylindrical outer surface of a semi-finished 
product obtained by rolling or drawing from a 
flat disc is gradually subjected to plastic deformation 
by means of rolls having annular projections adapted to 
form the profiles of the grooves by cold-heading. The 
various rolling steps are effected by different operating 
heads, each of which has a respective roll. This process has various disadvantages however. Specifically, the use of a single roll for each rolling 
step means that that roll must exert the entire load 
needed to achieve the desired deformation alone and 
acting on a single zone of contact of limited area. This 
causes the material to creep suddenly from the centre 
towards the ends of the zone of contact which leads to 
very high loads on the sides of the roll projections. 
This thus causes rapid wear and, in some cases, fracture 
of the roll itself. Moreover any small divergence of the  
 
straight line of action of the roll from the axis of the 
piece results in undesirable transverse components of the 
load being exerted on the roll itself and on the operating 
head. 
To what has been stated must be added the fact that 
pulleys made by means of the known processes often have 
unsatisfactorily precise dimensions due to irregularities 
in the flow of material during the plastic deformation. 
FR-A-2 527 957 (closest prior art for claim 1) discloses a rolling process in which two 
identical rolls are simultaneously used for each rolling 
operation. The load needed to achieve the desired 
deformation is therefore divided between the two rolls; 
however, since each of the rolls has a working profile 
which is complementary to the workpiece profile to be 
obtained in the corresponding rolling operation, no 
further advantage, but load reduction, is obtained with 
respect to the use of a single roll. 
Therefore, the aforesaid problems are only solved to a 
limited extent. 
The object of the present invention is to provide a 
rolling process for the manufacture of pulleys having 
peripheral grooves which is free from the disadvantages of 
the known processes specified above. 
This object is achieved by a rolling process as claimed in 
claim 1. 
The invention also relates to a rolling 
implement. Such an implement,

<CLAIMS>
A rolling process for the manufacture of a pulley(1) 
having at least one peripheral groove (6), in which a 

circular semi-finished product is rotated about its 
own axis and subjected to successive steps of plastic 

deformation by means of rolls (22, 23) having working 
profiles (31, 32), at least one of the steps being 

implemented by means of two rolls (22, 23) operating 
simultaneously on the same peripheral portion (5) of 

the semi-finished product intended to have the said 
groove (6), 
characterised in that
 said two rolls (22, 
23) operating simultaneously have respective working 

profiles (31, 32) which differ from each other. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 said two rolls (22, 23) are mounted on a movable 
support (21) which is pivotable about a first pivot 

axis (25) parallel to the axis of rotation (12) of 

the semi-finished product and to the respective 
axes(30) of the rolls (22, 23). 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
, in at least one other of the rolling steps, two further rolls 
(22, 23) 

operating simultaneously are employed, which 
have respective working profiles (31, 32) 

which are the same as each other. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised by
 including a first roughing 
step in which the grooves (6) are roughly formed by a  

 
first roll (22) having a substantially straight working 

profile (31) and a second roll (23) having a plurality 
of rounded annular projections. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised by
 including at least one step 
implemented by means of a pair of rolls (22, 23) having 

respective pluralities of annular projections (34), the 
projections of the rolls (22, 23) being staggered 

axially of each other. 
A process according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 
the projections (34) of the rolls (22, 23) are 

separated by portions with a straight profile. 
A rolling implement (20) adapted to be installed in an 
operating head (18) of a rolling machine (7) for the 

manufacture of pulleys (1) having at least one 
peripheral groove (6), said implement including a 

support (21) adapted to be mounted on the operating 
head and a pair of idle rolls (22, 23) having parallel 

axes and carried by the support (21) 

characterised in that

are fixedly mounted or said support (21), 

such that, in use, they
