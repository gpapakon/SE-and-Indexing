<ABSTRACT>
An accumulation conveyor (25) includes a plurality of product conveying zones 
(A,B....N) arranged in tandem, each zone including a series of conveying 

rollers (30). Each zone includes an actuator (38) for moving a drive belt 
(40) against the rollers (30) to drive them. Each zone includes a product 

sensor (42) comprising a mechanical sensor (46) and a valve (62). The valve 
(62) is pneumatically coupled to the actuator (38) of an upstream zone for 

causing operation thereof. When a particular one of the actuators (38) is 
operated, the mechanical sensor (42) positioned in its zone is retracted 

below the conveying rollers (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to accumulation
conveyors such as pneumatically actuated accumulation
conveyors. The invention is especially adapted for use
with belt-driven roller conveyors utilizing product
detecting sensor rollers, but may be used with other
drive systems and product detectors.Pneumatically actuated accumulating conveyors have long
been known. A commercially successful accumulation
conveyor is disclosed in US-A-3768630. The development
of accumulation conveyors has evolved to the point where
the units are reliable and controlled in a manner to
optimize the throughput of product while providing the
desired accumulation function. For example, in EP-A-0484098
(see also US-A-5191967, published after the
priority date hereof), the drive means of an associated
zone is deactivated if the product sensing means for that
zone and all of the product sensing means downstream of
that zone sense the presence of product in order to
produce an accumulation portion in which no zones are
actuated. The drive means of an associated zone is
actuated if any of the zones downstream of the associated
zone are activated in order to produce a transport
portion in which all zones upstream of any actuated zone
are actuated to transport product without singulation of
any upstream grouped product. The drive means for each
zone is connected directly to the source of actuating
fluid in order to actuate the drive means directly from
the source.In WO 93/01113 such direct connection with a source of 
actuating fluid is accomplished in the same manner by
attaching a pneumatic solenoid, or cylinder, to the arm
of the sensing roller of the controlled zone and
actuating the solenoid from the air diaphragm which
actuates the drive means of the zone downstream of the
controlled zone. With the pneumatic solenoid operatively
positioned to engage the sensor valve for the controlled
zone, the precise same operation as set forth in EP-A-0484098
and/or US-A-5191967 is accomplished. When any
product sensing roller downstream of a zone does not
sense the presence of a product, its sensor valve
actuates the air diaphragms in order to drive that zone.
This, in turn, actuates the solenoid of the upstream zone
which retracts the sensing roller and actuates the sensor
valve for that zone which drives the upstream zone. This
operation cascades upstream in order to retract the
sensor rollers for all zones upstream of a zone that do
not sense the presence of product in that zone.While such retractable sensor pneumatic control scheme is
