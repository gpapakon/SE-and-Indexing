<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically
powered smoking articles, and particularly to methods
and apparatus for controlling the supply of energy to
electrically powered smoking articles.A smoking article is a device in which a
flavor generating material, such as tobacco or a
tobacco-derived substance, is heated in order to
release flavorants. One type of smoking article is
described in commonly assigned United States Patent No.
5,060,671, which is hereby incorporated by reference in
its entirety. That patent describes an electrically
heated smoking article that uses a disposable array of
electrical heating elements. Each heating element has
an individual charge of tobacco flavor generating
material deposited thereon. The disposable array is
easily mated to the "permanent" portion of the smoking
article, which contains a power supply, such as a
battery, and control circuitry. In such a device, an
aerosol or vapor containing flavorants is generated as
a result of a transfer of thermal energy from at least
one, but less than all of the heating elements to the
tobacco flavor generating material deposited thereon
for each puff taken by the smoker.In smoking articles which use an array of
heating elements, control circuitry should be provided
for selecting which of the heating elements in the
array will be energized for a particular puff. If the
smoker is required to manually select the particular
element to be heated, the enjoyment associated with
using a smoking article may be diminished. Furthermore,
the control circuitry should be capable of
preventing repeated actuation of any one heating
element, to avoid re-heating of a charge of tobacco 
flavor generating material and consequent generation of
undesirable compounds which may have an adverse impact on
flavor.The control circuitry in a smoking article should
also be capable of regulating the power delivered to each
heating element to ensure that a sufficient amount of energy
is transferred to the tobacco flavor generating material, so
that a consistent aerosol or vapor is generated for each puff.
The power source of such smoking articles (typically a battery
or a series of batteries) loses charge over time; therefore,
it may be necessary to energize the heating elements longer as
the power supply ages, in order to deliver the same amount of
energy as when the power supply was new, so as to achieve an
acceptable aerosol or vapor.Smoking articles are typically small, hand-held
devices that are carried by the smoker, and the power supply
in such devices
