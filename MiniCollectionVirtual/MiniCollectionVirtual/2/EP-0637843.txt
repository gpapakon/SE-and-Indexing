<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a structure for protection against electrostatic overvoltages for the terminals of an integrated circuit of multiple supplies, each supply being connected between a high-potential terminal and a low-potential terminal. Each terminal (P1, P2, etc.) of the circuit, including supply terminals (VDD1, VDD2..., VSS1, VSS2...), is connected to the anode of a first diode (D1), the cathode of which is linked to a first conducting rail (R1) and to the cathode of a second diode (D2) the anode of which is linked to a second conducting rail (R2). A unidirectional clipper component (Z) is linked by its cathode to the first rail and by its anode to the second rail.

integrated circuit associated with a plurality of power

supply sources against electrostatic overvoltages, each
power supply being connected between a high voltage pad

and a low voltage pad, the circuit comprising:

a plurality of connecting pads of an
integrated circuit with a plurality of power supply

sources distributed between a plurality of input/output
pads (P1, P2,...) and a plurality of supply pads

consisting of a plurality of connection pads to a high
potential (VDD

, VDD
2
,..., VDD
i
,...) and a plurality of
connection pads to a low potential (VSS
1
,
VSS
2

j
,...),
a plurality of first diodes (D1),
a plurality of second diodes (D2),
a unidirectional clipping component (Z),

pads (P1, P2,...) and some of the supply pads (VDD
1
,
VDD
2
,..., VSS
1
, VSS
2
,...), each pad is connected to the
anode of one of the first diodes (D1), the cathode of

which is connected to the first conductive bus (R1),
and to the cathode of one of the second diodes (D2),

the anode of which is connected with the second
conductive bus (R2), and
the unidirectional clipping component (Z) is
connected by its cathode to the first conductive bus

(R1) and by its anode to the second conductive bus
(R2).
The protection circuit of claim 1,
characterized in that all the power supply pads are 

connected to the first and second diodes in the way
indicated in claim 1, for said
 some of the supply pads.
The protection circuit of claim 1,

the highest power supply source is connected to the

first bus, and the low voltage pad (VSS
j
) of the lowest
power supply source is connected to the second bus.
The protection circuit of claim 1,
characterized in that the buses (R1, R2) are

constituted by conductive paths that are formed at the
periphery of the integrated circuit, inside and beyond

the connecting pads, respectively.
