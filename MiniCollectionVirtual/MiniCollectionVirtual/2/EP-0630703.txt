<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing an easily openable can lid of a resin laminated metal plate, consisting of the 
steps of subjecting a resin laminated metal plate for easily openable can lids, which is composed of a metal plate or 

a surface-treated metal plate one or both surfaces of which are laminated with a crystalline saturated polyester resin 
film of a thickness of 10-100 µm, elongation of not less than 150 % and crystal melting heat at a crystallinity of not 

more than 10 % of not less than 10 joule/g to composite extrusion molding using upper and lower metal molds having 
a radius of round shoulders of 0.1-1.0 mm so as to form a cut guide groove of a thickness of its remaining uncut 

bottom portion of not more than 1/2 of the thickness of the raw metal plate, and thereafter heat treating the crystalline 
saturated polyester resin layer around the cut guide groove at a temperature not lower than the cold crystallization 

starting temperature and lower than the melting point thereof; and easily openable can lid obtained by this method; 
and a resin laminated metal plate used to obtain the can lid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an easy-open can lid comprising a laminated
metal sheet composed of a metal sheet such as a steel
sheet, aluminum sheet, or a surface-treated metal sheet
composed of such a metal sheet provided with surface
treatment film or plastic lamination such as tin plating,
a chromate film, a coating (painting), on which is
laminated a specific crystalline saturated polyester
resin film and which is provided with a tear-along groove
for facilitating opening of the can and to a resin
laminated metal sheet easy-open can lid
and a resin laminated metal sheet for an easy-open
can lid. The resin laminated metal sheet easy-open can
lid according to the present invention is superior in
ease of can opening, corrosion resistance, and feathering
property and is suitable for use for canned drinks,
general canned food, and other broad applications.Among the easy-open cans used for canned drinks,
general canned food, etc., there are the tear-off types
where a tab consisting of part or all of the container
lid is torn off by pulling and separated from the can
body and the stay-on tab types where the tab remains
attached to the can body. In these easy-open cans, coated
aluminum sheet or steel sheet is used as the can opening
material. This is punched out into the basic lid shape,
then is placed on a flat bottom die and pressed down on
by a top die on which is provided a sharp sectional edge
scoring blade shaped to the contour of the tab so as to
form a tab shaped tear-along groove with a V-sectional 
shape. To facilitate can opening, it was necessary to
press-form the tear-along groove by the scoring blade so
as to reach approximately 1/2 to 2/3 of the thickness of
the sheet before processing. If the depth of the tear-along
groove was too shallow, the ease of can opening
would be poor, while if too deep, the strength would be
insufficient and there would be problems in transport
such as opening of the can due to even small external
impact.The can-opening materials are being made extremely
thin due to the demands for ease of can opening.
Therefore, considerable precision is being demanded for
the scoring tools as well, and therefore, the problem has
arisen of a significantly reduced tool life. To deal with
this problem, measures have been devised to extend tool
life such as with the "process for formation of a tear-off
type tab for a can composed of forming a thin upward
facing connection piece between the portions around the
tab (tear-along bead groove) and the can body,
