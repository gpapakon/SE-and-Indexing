<ABSTRACT>
A microscope comprises a cantilever (3) having a distal 
end equipped with an electrically conductive probe (1) 

allowing current to flow and having a fine tip whose voltage 
is controllable, a position control mechanism (9, 17) for 

controlling position of a sample (6) with respect to a base 
end of the cantilever (3), a small displacement measuring 

mechanism (5, 10, 11) for measuring a deflection amount of the 
cantilever (3), and a deflection control mechanism (12, 13) 

for controlling deflection of the cantilever so as to adjust 
a distance between the fine tip of the probe (1) and the 

sample (6). A method for measuring surfaces using this novel 
microscope comprises steps of: maintaining deflection of the 

cantilever (3) at a constant value by using the small 
displacement measuring mechanism (5, 10, 11) and the 

deflection control mechanism (12, 13); applying a constant 
voltage between the electrically conductive probe (1) and the 

sample (6); scanning the sample (6) along surface of the 
sample with the probe (1), while a tunneling current is 

maintained at a constant value by using the position control 
mechanism (9, 17); and measuring a control amount of the 

position control mechanism (9, 17) in a direction vertical to 
the sample (6) and a control amount of the deflection control 

mechanism (12, 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning probe
microscope, and more particularly to an active cantilever
equipped, scanning probe microscope with advanced functions
combining the atomic force microscope (hereinafter abbreviated
as AFM) and the scanning tunneling microscope (hereinafter
abbreviated as STM) and to a method for measuring surfaces by
using this novel microscope.In early 1980s, STMs were developed as an apparatus
allowing the observation of surfaces of solids with atomic-scale
resolution. STMs utilize the phenomenon that a tunneling
current flowing between an electrically conductive probe with
a fine tip and the surface of a sample greatly depends on a
distance between the probe and the surface of the sample.
According to the STM measuring method, the probe scans the
surface of the sample over its surface to observe the atomic
arrangement while the tunneling current is maintained at a
constant value. Furthermore, the measurement of electronic
state density can be also executed by obtaining the voltage-current
characteristics of the tunneling current. Lately, some novel microscopes have been developed based
on the principle of such a STM measurement.Among them, AFMs are characterized by the detection of an
attractive force or a repulsive force acting between the
sample and the fine tip equipped probe, thereby enabling the
measurement of roughness on the sample surface. In other
words, the AFMs allow detailed observation, which was not
achieved by the conventional STMs, on the surface structures
of a wide range and a variety of materials, such as
semiconductors, metals, organism and insulators.However, these conventional STM and AFM, both a scanning
probe microscope, have been encountered with the difficulty in
identifying atomic species, in spite of the fact that they can
assure the observation of atomic arrangement on the surface of
metals, semiconductors, insulators, and the like. The AFM, if
the probe is supported on a cantilever of a small spring
constant to increase sensitivity in the vertical direction
with respect to the sample, will encounter with another
problem that, when the probe comes close to the sample, the
cantilever is abruptly attracted toward the sample as soon as
an attraction force acts between the sample and the probe. It
means that the conventional AFM may not maintain the distance
between the prove and the sample to cause a desired attracting
force therebetween. A scanning probe microscope according to the preamble of
claims 1 - 3 is disclosed in EP-A-0 449 221.The
