<ABSTRACT>
In a holder (100) for a disc-like article, there is provided in the surface (9, 10) facing the disc-like article a nozzle (8), from which gas emerges and holds the disc-like article, by means of the low pressure arising as a result of the Bernoulli principle, against a circular annular projection (108) provided in the surface (10) facing the article. The projection (108) is elastically flexible in the direction of the axis (14) of the holder (100), i.e. perpendicularly to the surface (10) of the holder (100) facing the article, so that the article is held securely on the holder (100) against displacement in a direction parallel to the surface (10) without it being necessary to provide lateral supports such as cams or the like. Since lateral supports can be forgone, these do not also hinder the flowing off of treatment liquid from the edge of the article which is secured on the holder (100).

A holder (1, 100) for disc-shaped articles (11) based on the Bernoulli principle, with a nozzle (8)
in the surface (9, 10) ofthe holder (1, 100) facing the article (11), surrounding an axis (14)

through the centre of the said surface (9, 10) and perpendicular to the surface (9, 10), and to
which gas under pressure can be fed to form a gas cushion between the holder (1) and the disc-shaped

article (11), and with at least one projection (85, 90, 108) in the said surface (9, 10) of the
holder (1, 100) facing the article (11), as a support pad for the article, wherein the projection (85,

90, 108) is disposed within the region of the surface (9, 10) of the holder (1, 100) facing the
article (11) which is surrounded by the nozzle (8), characterized in that the holder is rotatable

about the said axis (14) and in that the projection (85, 90, 108) is provided at least regionally at a
radial distance from the axis (14) of the holder (1, 100) but radially inside the nozzle (8) and

there forms a support pad for the article (11).

material.
A holder according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the projection (85, 90, 108) is elastically
yielding in a direction perpendicular to the surface (9, 10) of the holder (1, 100) facing the article

(11).
A holder according to claim 1 or 3, characterized in that the projection is concentric with the axis
(14) ofthe holder (1, 100).
A holder according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the projection (85) is a plate of
elastically yielding material sunk into the surface (9, 10) of the holder (1) facing the article (11).
A holder according to any of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the plate (85) is a plate (85) of
porous plastics material or porous ceramic.
A holder according to any of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the plate (85) is supported
relative to the holder (1) by elastic elements.
A holder according to claim 7, characterized in that the elastic elements are helical springs (94). 
A holder according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the projection in the surface (9, 10) of
the holder (100) facing the article (11) is a ring (108) of elastically yielding material fitted in the

surface (9, 10) of the holder (100) facing the article (11).
A holder according to claim 9, charactenzed in that the ring (108) of elastically yielding material
is fitted in a circular groove (107) in the surface (10) of the holder (100) facing the article (11)
A holder according to claim 9 or 10, charactenzed in that the ring (108) consists of silicone

coated with Teflon.
A holder according to claim 9 or 10, charactenzed in that the ring (108) consists of porous
plastics material or is hollow.
A holder according to claim 1, characterized in that several projections (90) are arranged in a row
parallel to the outer periphery of the holder (1) ) in the surface (10) of the holder (1) ) facing the

article (11), in a circle in the case of a circular holder (1),
A holder according to claim 13, characterized in that each projection (90) is supported relative to
the holder (1) by an elastic element (94).
