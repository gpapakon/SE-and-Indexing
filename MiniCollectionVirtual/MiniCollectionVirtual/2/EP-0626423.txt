<DESCRIPTION>
Polyimides, such as those described in Edwards, U.S. Patent 
3,179,614, can be used in a wide variety of commercial applications. The 
outstanding performance characteristics of these polymers under stress and at 
high temperatures have made them useful in the form of bushings, seals, 
electrical insulators, compressor vanes and impellers, pistons and piston rings, 
gears, thread guides, cams, brake linings, and clutch faces. It is often desirable to incorporate various additives in such 
polyimide compositions before fabrication into their final form. Accordingly, 
graphite has been incorporated to improve the wear characteristics in bearing 
applications. Diamonds have been incorporated for abrasive applications. 
Fluoropolymers have been incorporated in the past for lubricity in forming and 
extrusion of shapes. Despite the variety of polyimides and additives that have 
previously been available, a continuing need for polyimide compositions, 
particularly when processed into the shape of bushings and bearings, is a 
reduction in the thermal expansion of such materials. In bushings and bearings, 
close clearances to adjacent metal surfaces are needed, in combination with 
excellent wear characteristics. In the past, while additives could be incorporated 
for the reduction of wear, it has previous not been possible to prepare a polyimide 
composition having both low wear and friction performance and a low coefficient 
of thermal expansion. The present invention provides polyimide compositions containing 
graphite and a fibrous inorganic filler which exhibits greatly reduced thermal 
expansion compared with the same composition containing no fibrous filler. The 
compositions also exhibit low wear and friction performance against a steel 
mating surface, equivalent to the same composition containing no fibrous 
inorganic filler. Specifically, the present invention provides a polyimide 
composition consisting essentially of complemental quantities of about 25-65 
parts of at least one polyimide, about 25-45 parts by weight of graphite powder, 
and about 10-30 parts by weight of wollastonite.  The compositions of the present invention contain about 25-65 
parts by weight of at least one polyimide, and preferably about 35-55 wt %. Parts 
by weight, in the present invention, are indicated as parts per 100 parts of the 
combination of polyimide, graphite, and wollastonite. A wide variety of 
polyimides can be used, including those described in Edwards, U.S. Patent 
3,179,614, hereby incorporated by reference.
