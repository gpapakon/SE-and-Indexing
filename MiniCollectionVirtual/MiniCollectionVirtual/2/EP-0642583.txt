<DESCRIPTION>
Various references and patents are cited below. The 
full disclosure of these references is hereby incorporated 
by reference into the application to more fully describe 
the state of the art. NM23 is a protein which was identified based on its 
reduced expression in highly metastatic tumor cells. U.S. 
Patent No. 5,049,662, filed October 13, 1987 and issued 
September 17, 1991, describes the first successful cloning 
of nm23 as well as predicting metastatic potential from 
nm23 RNA levels (see also Leone et al., Cell 65:25-35 
(1991)). Nm23 was subsequently shown to be homologous to 
Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate kinase (hereinafter 
"NDPK") (Wallet et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:1199-1202 
(1990)). NDPKs were long known to transfer a terminal 
phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside 
diphosphate. Two closely related forms of human nm23, 
nm23-Hl and nm23-H2, have been identified which are about 
90% homologous at the DNA level (Rosengard et al., Nature 
342:177-180 (1989); Stahl et al., Cancer Res. 48:6550-6554 
(1991)). Chu and Chang, Science 242:564-567 (1988) identified 
a nuclear factor that binds damaged DNA, and is absent in 
the E complementation group of xeroderma pigmentosum 
patients. This factor, termed "XPE-BF", is thought to be 
involved in the recognition step of DNA excision repair. 
A functional homolog of XPE-BF is the yeast photolyase, a 
photo-reactivating enzyme that repairs pyrimidine dimers 
(Patterson and Chu, Mol. Cell-Biol. 9:5105-5112 (1989)). 
Tumor cell lines grown in progressively increasing  
 
concentrations of cisplatin, a DNA-damaging 
chemotherapeutic drug, were tested for nuclear XPE-BF 
levels (Chu and Chang, P.N.A.S. 87:3324-3327 (1990)). The 
HeLa-R1 cell line was found to be 4.7-fold more resistant 
to cisplatin inhibition of growth than parental HeLa 
cells, and concurrently exhibited a 4-fold increase in 
XPE-BF level. However, the further selection in cisplatin 
of the HeLa-R3 cell line, which was 14-fold more resistant 
to cisplatin inhibition of growth than parental cells, was 
not accompanied by a further increase in XPE-BF level. The present invention provides the surprising 
discovery that increased expression of nm23 increases the 
susceptibility of a cell for chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy. Further, the subject data shows increased 
expression of nm23 can result in reduced levels of XPE-BF. 
Thus, the invention provides an exciting means to increase 
the susceptibility of tumor cells to DNA damaging agents.
