<ABSTRACT>
In an image projecting apparatus such as a 
microfilm reader and a microfilm reader printer, 

without causing no distortion and blur in a projected 
image on a screen surface, the inclination angle of 

the screen can be changed for the user to see the 
screen surface with ease such that the screen surface 

becomes rectangular to the user's line of sight and 
the external light reflected by the screen surface 

is prevented from entering the user's eyes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
projecting apparatus such as a microfilm reader and
a microfilm reader printer.In a conventional film reader or reader printer,
generally, a screen of a reader section is secured
to its apparatus body in an upright state. Therefore,
the angle of the screen cannot be changed.Then, when observing an image projected on
the screen, depending on the height of the apparatus,
the height of the chair or users' sitting heights,
some users cannot see the screen surface well and need
to see it upwardly (angle of elevation) or downwardly
(angle of depression) as their line of sight does not
become orthogonal thereto.Also, even though the external light such as
fluorescent light and outdoor daylight reflected by
the screen surface enters users' eyes and the users
cannot see the projected image on the screen surface
well, they cannot prevent its condition by changing
the angle of the screen. In JP-A-58161480 a television receiver of the projective type is disclosed having
a television projection tube, and a first and a second mirror for projecting television
pictures on a screen. The second mirror and the screen are rigidly fixed together
by a swivel arm. The swivel arm is pivotly arranged around a central part of the
second mirror, so that the screen and the second mirror rotate in common. By
rotating the screen the center of the displayed image is shifted. Such shift of the
displayed image results in an image distortion and the displayed image is running
out-of-focus.From US 5,047,800 an image projecting apparatus is known having a fixedly
arranged screen and mirrors for projecting an image onto the screen. This
apparatus further comprises a printing section for printing an image. In the
optical path between a light source for illuminating a microfilm and said screen
an image rotating prism for rotating the direction of the image to be projected
and an optical element for shifting the optical axis are arranged. These optical
elements allow to correct the position of an image to be recorded. It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide an image projecting apparatus
which enables a user to see the surface of a screen
with ease.The object is solved by an image
projecting apparatus according to
claim 1. Advantageous embodiments
are defined in the subclaims.At least one
reflection mirror is provided in a projection optical
system for projecting the image of the image carrying
member on the screen. When changing the inclination
angle of the screen, both the
