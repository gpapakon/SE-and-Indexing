<ABSTRACT>
The fixing device has a covering hood (1) with a gripping magnet body (5) inside it, coupled to a hood cover part (7) and movable into a hood aperture (2) for a ferromagnetic formwork base opposite it. There are one or more individual spring elements (8) between the cover part and the gripping magnet body. They can be turned out towards the hood aperture when the gripping magnet body is placed on the base.

<CLAIMS>
A fixing device for shuttering purposes, with a
covering hood (1) and a magnetic clamp body (5) which is

arranged inside the covering hood (1), is coupled via
connecting means to a hood cover part (7) and can be guided

relative thereto in the vicinity of a hood opening (2) which
is associated with an opposing ferromagnetic shuttering

support (22), on which or from which the magnetic clamp body
(5) can be mounted or released respectively depending on its

position, with respect to the cover part (7), 
characterised
in that
 between the cover part (7) and the magnetic clamp
body (5) one or more individual spring elements (8) are

inserted as connecting means and are aligned (8a) so that
when the magnetic clamp body (5) is mounted on the

shuttering support they can be deflected in the direction of
the hood opening (2), wherein the spring element or elements

(8,8b) are in the form of tension springs (8) which, on the
one hand, are secured to the inside of the cover part (7)

and, on the other hand, are secured to the opposing upper
side of the magnetic clamp body (5).
A fixing device according to Claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the spring elements (8,8b) are of basic cylindrical
shape and arranged so that the longitudinal axis (8a) of

the basic shape extends in a direction through the hood
opening (2).
A fixing device according to Claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 the spring element (8,8b) is applied with its end
face (14,15) against the inside or outside of the hood cover

part (7) and/or against an outside of the magnetic clamp
body (5) facing away from the hood opening (2). 
A fixing device according to any one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 the spring elements
are made of rubber material.
A fixing device according to any one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterised by
 a removal member (10)
engaging on the magnetic clamp body (5), which passes

through the covering hood (1) and has a handle which can be
operated outside the covering hood (1) and which,

preferably, consists of non-magnetisable material, including
non-magnetic high-quality steel.
A fixing device according to Claim 5, 
characterised
in that
 the removal member (10) passes through the covering
hood (1) with a bolt (11) fastened to the magnetic clamp

body (5), on the outer projecting end of which there is
formed as a handle a plate-like or dish-like knob (12) which

forms an underside (27) opposing the hood outside for the
engagement of a lever implement (24) bearing on the outside

of the hood.
A fixing device according to Claim 6, 
characterised
in that
 the bolt (11) is so aligned that its imaginary
extension (11a) passes through the hood opening (2).
A fixing device according to any one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterised by
 an elongate basic shape
at least of the covering hood (1) with a length (1) which is

at least a multiple of the width (b) of the upper side of
the covering hood (1).
A fixing device according to the preamble of Claim

1, 
characterised in that
 the covering hood (1) has opposing
side walls (20a,20b) which diverge outwardly from one

another at least at an edge portion (S) respectively
adjoining the hood opening (2). 
A fixing device according to Claim 9, 
characterised
in that
 the opposing side walls (20a,20b) have portions (P)
extending parallel to one another, which each merge into the

diverging edge portions (S) respectively via an obtuse angle
(w).
A fixing device according to Claim 9 or 10,

characterised by
 a removal member (10) engaging on the
magnetic clamp body (5), which passes through the covering

hood (1) with a shank or bolt (11) secured to the magnetic
clamp body (5) and has a handle which can be operated

outside the covering hood (1) and which is formed on the
outwardly protruding end of the shank or bolt (11) as a

plate-like or dish-like knob (12) which, at its free
outwardly facing upper or end side, is provided with a

contact surface (30) for the underside of the magnetic clamp
body (5) of another stacked-up fixing device.
A fixing device according to Claim 11,

characterised in that
 the width, breadth or diameter of the
knob (12) is of smaller dimensions than the distance apart

of the opposing side walls (20a,20b) of the covering hood
(1).
A fixing device according to Claim 11 or 12,

characterised in that
 the removal member (10) and/or at
least its handle or its knob (12) consists of non-magnetisable

material, in particular non-magnetic high-quality
steel.
A fixing device according to Claim 11,12 or 13,

characterised in that
 the distance or difference in height
(31) of the upper or end side (30) of the knob (12) from or

with respect to the upper side of the hood cover part (7)
corresponds to the distance (A) or difference in height of 

the underside of the magnetic clamp body (5) from or with
respect to the hood opening (2) defined by the diverging

side wall edge portions (S) if the magnetic clamp body (5)
is situated in its position released from the shuttering

support (22) and withdrawn from the hood opening (2).
A stack of a plurality of fixing devices according
to any one of Claims 9 to 13, 
characterised in that
 in each
case an upper fixing device is mounted with its hood opening

(2) on the cover part (7) of a lower fixing device, and the
opposing diverging side wall edge portions (S) of the upper

fixing device enclose with their insides the cover part (7)
of the covering hood (1) of the lower fixing device and/or

the upper outer edges (29a,29b) thereof between the hood
cover part (7) and the opposing side walls (20a,20b).
A stack according to Claim 15, with a plurality of
fixing devices according to Claim 11,12,13 or 14,


characterised in that
 in each case an upper fixing device is
placed with the underside of its magnetic clamp body (5) on

the upper or end side (30) of the knob (12) of a lower
fixing device.
