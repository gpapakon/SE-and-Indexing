<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having the formula X-A-Y are disclosed where X and Y are groups capable of intercalating DNA and comprise optionally substituted fused bi- or polycyclic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic at least partially aromatic ring systems having a substantially flat conformation. A is a substantially rigid divalent group which is extended such that X and Y are kept apart at a substantially fixed distance from each other such that X and Y are capable of intercalating different DNA duplexes. The compounds have potential applications as anti-tumour and antiviral agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DNA BIS-INTERCALATORSThis invention relates to a novel class of DNA bis-intercalators .DNA intercalators are compounds which bind to DNA duplexes by inserting between base pairs in the 5 DNA chain. DNA bis-intercalators have two intercalating groups in a single molecule and this enables these compounds to bind twice to a double stranded DNA chain. Many DNA bis-intercalators are known and have been discussed by, for example, LePecq 0 et al. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 2915- 2919, Cannellakis et al. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 418, 277-289, Gaugain et al. (1978) Biochem. , 17, 5078-5088, Welsh et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 198, 63-71. In all of these references, the two c intercalating groups of the molecule are joined together by a flexible linking group about which they can rotate freely. Since the linking group is flexible, the free energy of binding is more favourable _ if the intercalation occurs 0 intramolecularly rather than intermolecularly . Hence the binding of one intercalating group inevitably leaves the other in close proximity to other' binding sites in the same duplex and hence relative movement of the intercalating groups leads to intramolecular 5 cross-linking. Wakelin, Medicinal Research Reviews, 1986, 6, 275, has shown that in such cases the intercalating groups insert between base pairs which are only a few nucleotides apart in the DNA chain. Previous bis-intercalators have thus achieved Q intramolecular rather than intermolecular cross- linking .The present invention relates to DNA bis- intercalators having two intercalating groups linked by a rigid linker unit which has an extended c configuration. The requirement that the linker should 

 be rigid and have an extended configuration ensures that the two intercalating groups are kept apart from each other at an essentially fixed distance and angle. The linker should be rigid so that the intercalating groups are held apart and are extended such that they are kept apart to permit one intercalating group to be free to bind to a DNA duplex when the other is already bound to a different DNA duplex. The binding of both -intercalatorε into the same duplex is thus prohibited unless the duplex folds back on itself to cross-link distant parts of. the same molecule. The bis- intercalators with rigid linkers of the present invention, therefore, cross-link DNA duplexes to form intermolecular links or cross-link distant parts of the same molecule. The binding of one intercalating group leaves the other group pointing out from the
