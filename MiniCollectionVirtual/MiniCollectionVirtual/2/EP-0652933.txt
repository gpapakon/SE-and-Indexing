<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detergent compositions containing
crystalline layered silicates and ethylenediamine-N, N'-disuccinic
acid or salts thereof.Detergent compositions incorporating layered sodium silicates are
known in the art, being disclosed in, for example, DE-A-3742043
and EP-A-0337219. These disclosures teach that the layered
crystalline forms of sodium silicate display superior mineral hardness
sequestration ability relative to the corresponding silicate salts in
amorphous form and are thus advantageous as detergent builder
materials.Laundry detergent compositions containing the nil-phosphorus,
chelant, ethylenediamine-N, N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) are also
known in the art, being disclosed in, for example, EP-A-0267 653.
This disclosure teaches that EDDS when incorporated in such
laundry compositions assists in the removal of food, beverage and
certain other organic stains from fabrics during the laundry process.
It also teaches that EDDS may be used as a replacement for all or
part of the phosphonate chelants currently used in many existing
laundry products.A known problem associated with laundry washing processes is the
deposition and build up of insoluble inorganic salt encrustations on
the surface of the fabrics during the wash process. These
encrustations may remain largely intact on the fabric surface at the
end of the wash process. Over a number of wash cycles further
build up of such insoluble inorganic salt deposits may occur giving 
the fabrics a dingy, discoloured appearance. The inorganic salts are
largely calcium or magnesium salts or salts of heavy metal ions such
as zinc, iron, manganese and copper.The Applicant has established that it is the build up of insoluble
heavy metal ion salts which principally contributes to the
aforementioned dingy and discoloured fabric appearance. The
Applicant has also established that the encrustation of such heavy
metal ion salts on the surface of the fabrics may contribute to
localised fabric damage when the fabric is washed using a detergent
composition containing a peroxygen bleach. This effect arises due to
the action of the heavy metal ion salt which catalytically activates the
peroxygen bleach at the fabric surface, thus causing fabric damage.The Applicant has now found that the above mentioned problem of
build up on fabrics of insoluble inorganic salts, and particularly
heavy metal ion salts, over a number of wash cycles, can be
mitigated by the use of laundry detergent compositions containing
crystalline layered sodium silicates and EDDS
