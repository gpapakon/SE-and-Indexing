<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission system having a synchroniser (1) for forming a plesiochronous or synchronous signal, with at least one device (2, 3) for forwarding the signal and with a desynchroniser (4). The desynchroniser (4) contains at least one buffer memory (4) for temporarily storing data of a transport element, contained in the signal, a write address generator (8) for controlling the process of writing the data into the buffer memory (5), a control arrangement (7) for forming a control signal for the write address generator (8) from the signal, a read address generator (10) for controlling the process of reading the data out of the buffer memory (5), a differential arrangement (12) for forming difference values from the addresses of write and read address generator (8, 10) and a circuit (11) for generating from the difference values a read clock signal supplied to the read address generator (10). The control arrangement (7) is also provided for determining the displacement of at least one transport unit in the signal and for supplying the displacement found to a correction circuit (9) which is used for forming the phase deviation between a subordinate transport unit and a higher-level transport unit. A combining circuit (14) is in each case provided for combining a correction value formed from the subtraction of the two phase deviations and a difference value of the differential arrangement (12).
