<ABSTRACT>
Mammamodulin (MM), a novel 52-55 kDa protein expressed by hormone-independent mammary tumor cells, has been found to affect the morphology, motility, growth and hormone receptor expression of hormone-dependent mammary tumor cells. The presence of MM, e.g., in tumor biopsies, is an important diagnostic indicator. Inhibitors of MM activity, such as MAbs to MM and MM antagonists, are useful in the treatment and control of breast cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
MAMMAMODULIN , A HORMONE-INDEPENDENT MAMMARY TUMOR CELLS SPECIFIC PROTEIN.This invention relates to mamπiamodulin, which is a novel factor not known to exist so far in nature, produced by hormone-independent human mammary tumor cells affecting the morphology, growth and hormone receptor expression of hormone-dependent tumor cells. More specifically the invention relates to mammamodulin in purified form, i.e. at least partially free from compounds with which it is associated in nature, up to high purity, e.g. enabling the determination of at least partial amino acid sequence(s). Means for the production and purification of mammamodulin are described, as are related diagnostic and therapeutic strategies made possible by the discovery of this factor.Growth of human mammary tumors is a complex process governed by hormones and growth factors of endocrine, autocrine and paracrine origin. An important feature of mammary tumors is their dependency on hormones, particularly estrogen. This hormone dependency is often lost as the cancer develops, rendering endocrine treatment ineffective, and correlates closely with more aggressive behavior by the tumors. The prognosis for breast cancer victims once the tumor enters the hormone-independent stage is extremely poor.It has now been discovered that a previously unknown factor, which has been named mammamodulin (MM), is expressed by hormone-independent mammary tumor cells. This factor stimulates less aggressive, hormone- dependent tumor cells to grow more rapidly while the expression of hormone receptors is down modulated. It is believed that, long term, MM plays a central role in the phenotypic switch from hormone-dependency to hormone- independency during tumor progression. 

 This factor has been, for the first time, identified, isolated and purified. Availability of substantially pure MM now enables various diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of breast cancer. For example, MM levels may be assayed and used as a diagnostic indicator to determine the stage and seriousness of breast cancer. Substances which are observed to suppress MM's cell activation properties, as well as monoclonal antibodies to MM or other MM binders, may be used as therapeutics to block MM's stimulation of hormone-dependent cells, thereby stabilizing the cancer and preventing progression into the aggressive, hormone-independent stage of tumor growth. Finally, MM analogues may be used therapeutically to block MM receptors on hormone-dependent cells.MM is a protein having an
