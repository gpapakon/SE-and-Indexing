<ABSTRACT>
A needleless injection device (20) includes an initiator valve (144) controlling flow of compressed gas into a reservoir (168). A poppet valve (170) connecting to the reservoir has a gas pressure regulation end to regulate flow from the initiator valve into the reservoir. A clamp piston (210) is driven forward by gas pressure from the reservoir and causes jaws (236) to clamp onto a plunger (362) extending into an ampule (360). The poppet valve opens when reservoir pressure reaches the cracking pressure of the poppet valve. Gas from the reservoir rushes through the poppet valve into a drive chamber and forces a drive piston (212), containing the clamp piston and jaws, forward causing the plunger to slide into the ampule. A jet of injectant is ejected out of the nozzle of the ampule and penetrates through the patient's skin. An improved method of needleless injection uses a specific pressure profile, ampule nozzle diameter, patient, injection site, and injectant parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a needleless
hypodermic injection method.Various needleless hypodermic injection devices have
been known and used in the past for performing the method
according to the invention. These devices, also
known as jet injectors, typically use spring or compressed
gas driven plungers to accelerate an injectant to a
velocity sufficient to pierce through the skin and enter
the underlying tissues.The document US-A-4722728 discloses an injector which pressurizes
a fluid injectant within an ampule by driving a plunger into the
ampule with sufficient force to expel the desired volume of
fluid.While large jet injection apparatus have been successfully
used for mass inoculations, e.g. in the military
services, these apparatus are relatively complex, costly,
limited in performance and are not portable. Thus,
injections using needles remain as the standard despite
their disadvantages (for example, accidental needle sticks
and risk of spreading infection to both the patient and
medical professional; safe disposal of the used needle,
patient's fear of needles; and pain caused by needle
injections). Jet injection avoids or diminishes these
disadvantages.Although many portable needleless injectors have been
proposed, these known devices have not achieved widespread
acceptance in the medical field, due to a variety of
factors. Significantly, the characteristics of needleless or
jet injections typically vary with the pressures exerted
by the injection device, the nozzle diameter of the
ampule, the patient's size, age and weight, the nature of
the injection site, and the viscosity of the injectant.A long standing basic difficulty with jet injection
has been the complex problem of determining which are the
preferred injection variables. These variables include:
1) pressure profile, 2) nozzle size, 3) patient factors,
i.e., age, sex and size, 4) injection site, and 5) medication
viscosity. The repeated failures of the prior art to
adequately solve these complex variables problems has
contributed to the lack of acceptance of a handheld and
portable jet injector in the medical community.The pressure profile is the pressure exerted on the
liquid injectant, typically measured over time, from the
beginning to the end of the injection. The pressure
profile must be selected, in combination with the nozzle
size and other factors, to deliver the injectant through
the skin to the desired depth, preferably with minimum
pain.The patient factors are also important. Gender is
significant as women typically

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing an injection jet by pressurizing a
fluid injectant within an ampule (360), comprising the steps

of:

driving a plunger (362) into the ampule (360) with
sufficient force to generate a pressure of 26000-30000

kPa within 6 milliseconds;
reducing the pressure generally linearly until
0.5 ml is expelled and the pressure is

8000-14000 kPa;
maintaining the pressure at 8000-14000 kPa
until a desired volume of injectant is expelled from the ampule

(360); and
reducing the pressure to about 0.0 kPa within
5.0 milliseconds.
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of
adjusting the diameter of the nozzle opening of the ampule

(360).
The method of claim 1 or 2 further comprising the step of
adjusting the viscosity of the injectant.
The method of claim 3 wherein the viscosity of the
injectant is from 0.01 to 0.70 poise.
The method of one of claims 1-4 further comprising the step
of filtering the compressed gas before releasing it into a

reservoir.
