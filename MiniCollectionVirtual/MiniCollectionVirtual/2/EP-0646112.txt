<DESCRIPTION>
 TERTIARY AND SECONDARY AMINES AS ALPHA-2 ANTAGONISTS AND SEROTONIN UPTAKE INHIBITORSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to novel organic compounds and compositions which are both alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonists and serotonin (5- hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake inhibitors, processes for making such compounds, synthetic intermediates employed in these processes, and a method for treating diseases of the central nervous system including depression, aggression, obsessive compulsive disorders, panic attacks, memory disturbances, anxiety, hypochondriasis, and aspects of Alzheimer's disease, diseases of the vascular system including hypertension, glaucoma and migraine, metabolic disorders such as diabetes or feeding disorders, and alcoholism.Background of the Invention There is evidence that the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders is related to some type of serotonin dysfunction. The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine binds with high affinity to a recognition site associated with the transport of 5-HT. The site at which these tricyclic antidepressants bind is not identical to the 5-HT binding site and yet binding of compounds of this type inhibits the uptake of 5-HT (serotonin); an allosteric relationship is postulated (Charney, D.S., Krystal, J.H., Delgado, P.L., Heninger, G.R., Annu. Rev. Med. 1990, 41: 437). A number of compounds which demonstrate highly selective serotonin uptake inhibition have shown clinical efficacy as antidepressants (Fuller, R.W., Wong, D.T., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Set, 1990, 600: 68). It has been found that serotonin uptake inhibitors bind with less affinity to neurotransmitter receptors than the tricyclic antidepressants; this lower binding affinity is thought to be responsible for fewer chlorinergic and histaminergic side effects for these uptake, inhibitors (Robertson, D.W., Fuller, R.W., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., 1991, 26: 23) relative to the tricyclic antidepressants.Serotonin uptake inhibitors are thought to offer clinical advantages over the tricyclic antidepressants because they exhibit fewer severe adverse drug reactions, particularly as far as cardiovascular side effects and overdose potential. Serotonin uptake inhibitors have shown some indications of efficacy in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (Zak, J., Miller, J., Sheehan, D., Fanous, B., J. 

 Clin. Psychiatry, 1990, 49: 23), panic disorders (Baton, R., Pohl, R.I., Yergani, V., Rainey, J., Oxenkrug, G., Acta. Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75: 315), alchoholism (Gill, K., Amit, Z., Koe, K-,
