Fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion 
engines with a nozzle body (10) in which a pressure space 

(21) connected to a fuel feed passage (47) and, at the 

combustion-chamber end, a valve seat (18) are formed, 
with a valve needle (15) which, at its combustion-chamber 

end, has a closing head (16) that opens towards the 
outside and interacts with the valve seat (18) on the 

nozzle body (10) and has an offset piston (20) delimiting 
the pressure space (21) axially and acted upon by the 

fuel, with a closing spring (40) tensioning the valve 
needle (15) against the valve seat (18) with the sealing 

surface of the closing head (16), counter to the flow of 
fuel, and with spray openings, controllable as a function 

of the needle stroke, in the piston (20) of the valve 
needle (15), the piston (20), which directly adjoins the 

closing head (16) in the upstream direction, having a 
recess (25) open axially towards the pressure space (21), 

characterized in that the recess (25) is bounded at the 
periphery by a shell (26) and radially at the inside by 

the stem (14) of the valve needle (15), and in that the 
spray openings are part of apertures (30; 33) which 

penetrate the shell (26) and emerge in the circumference 
of the shell (26) at a location axially offset from the 

sealing surface (17) of the closing head (16), the piston 
(20) accommodating the spray openings and the valve 

needle (15) forming a one-piece component. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the recess (25) in the piston (20) 

is open wide towards the pressure space (21) and in that  
 

the apertures (30; 33) extend as far as the base (24) of 
the recess (25). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to either of 
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the axes of the 

spray holes (30) extend along the lateral surface of an 
obtuse cone. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the apertures (30, 

33) have an elongate cross-section extending parallel to 
the centre line of the valve needle 15. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the cross-section of the apertures 

(30, 33) widens from the base to the end of the piston 
(20). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the cross-section of the apertures 

(30, 33) has the shape of a rectangle, triangle or oval. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of preceding 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the apertures 

(30, 33) are designed as holes (30) penetrating the shell 
(26) of the piston (20). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the apertures (30, 

33) are designed as grooves (33) which penetrate the 
shell (26) of the piston (20), starting from the end of 

the latter. 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a relief cut (23) is arranged at 

the transition from the sealing surface (17) and the 
piston (20) of the closing head (16). 
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that an annular suface (19), the angle 

of taper of which is more obtuse than that of the sealing 
surface (17), is arranged between the sealing surface 

(17) of the closing head (16) and the relief cut (23).
