<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel quaternary 
ammonium salts and said salts for use as medicines. Conventionally, trimebutine maleate has been primarily 
used as a gastroprokinetic agent. Trimebutine maleate has wide utility due to its 
dual activities of promoting and suppressing the gastric 
contractions. However, it is not necessarily satisfactory in 
that relatively high dose, i.e., 300 mg per day is required, 
and that adverse side effects are involved. Therefore, studies have been conducted in search for 
gastroprokinetic agents which can replace trimebutine 
maleate (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No. 
163074/1991). However, the results have not necessarily been 
successful in providing gastroprokinetics. 
Accordingly, development of drugs which possess much 
stronger activity in enhancement of gastrointestinal 
motility has still been desired. J. Org. Chem., Vol. 51, pages 730 to 732 describes 
the compound 1-oxo-1-[(2-(((((5-trimethylammonio)methyl)-2-furanyl)methyl)thio)ethyl)amino]-2-nitroethene 
(V). The present invention provides novel quaternary ammonium 
salts represented by the following  
 
formula (I): 
 
wherein R1 and R2 represent alkyl groups having 1 to 5 
carbon atoms which may be the same or different from each 
other; R3 represents hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon 
atoms, phenyl, benzyl, or -COOR4 (wherein R4 represents 
alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms); A represents alkyl having 
1 to 5 carbon atoms, alkenyl having 2 to 5 carbon 
atoms, alkynyl having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, -(CH2)p-COOR5 
(wherein R5 represents hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to 5 
carbon atoms, and p represents an integer 
of from 1 to 5), 
 
(wherein 
R6 represents hydrogen, hydroxyl, nitro, alkyl having 1 to 
5 carbon atoms, -COOR5, or -SO3R5); Q- represents a 
counter anion of quaternary ammonium salt; X represents 
  
 
Y represents methylene, oxygen or sulfur; Z represents 
 
(wherein R7 and R8 are the same or different from each 
other and independently represent hydrogen, halogen, 
nitro, alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or lower alkoxyl, 
and R9 represents alkyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or 
phenyl); l and m represent each an integer of 1 or 2; and 
n represents an integer of from 1 to 3, 
and said salts for use as medicines. Since the compounds according to the present invention 
have an activity of accelerating the gastrointestinal 
contractions, i.e., they improve the gastrointestinal motility 
remarkably, as well as high safety, they have utility in the 
medical field of
