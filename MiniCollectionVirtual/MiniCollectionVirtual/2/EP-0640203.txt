<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 
a furnace assembly and a process for treating exhaust air from a sludge drying system. An example of a furnace assembly and a process for treating exhaust air 
from a sludge drying system is shown in FR-A-2 466 439. In this document, 
the deodorizing chamber is not fluidly separated from the exhaust chamber. Sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment 
plant or a paper mill is mainly mechanically dewatered. 
This mechanically dewatered sludge is fed to a sludge 
drying plant which utilizes heated air in a rotating drying 
drum. The dried sludge is pelletized and can be either 
sold as fertilizer or disposed of as permitted by 
restricting regulations. The air discharged from the 
dryer, i.e., exhaust air, is cooled after separation from 
the sludge particles. A main portion of the exhaust air is 
recycled to the burner. The rest of the exhaust air is 
released into the atmosphere. If not further treated, the 
exhaust air released into the atmosphere will usually  
 
include unwanted organic particles which may accumulate 
during the drying process. This exhaust air may cause 
emission problems due to its odor and organic substance 
content which is being restricted to low concentrations. It is known that such organic substances are 
inactivated at temperatures of above 800°C and this has lead 
to the use of afterburners for removal from the exhaust 
air. Such system is disclosed in VSA - Dokumentation, 
"Klarschlamm behandeln" by U. Keller (1981). A process 
using afterburners will require additional energy to burn 
the exhaust air and expensive equipment to be added to the 
system. Also, the amount of exhaust air created by the 
entire sludge drying process will increase considerably. Examples of other sludge drying systems are disclosed 
in U.S. Patents: 3,410,233 to Seiler; 3,963,471 to 
Hampton; 4,761,893 to Glorioso; 4,901,654 to Albertson et 
al; 4,926,764 to van den Broek; 4,953,478 to Glorioso; and 
5,069,801 to Girovich, all of which are hereby incorporated 
herein by reference. Such prior systems provide a wet scrubber and/or an 
afterburner for treating exhaust air, which require 
extensive modification to existing systems and have high 
operating costs. A major cost factor of prior systems is a separate 
afterburner for burning the exhaust air containing the 
organic particles. The exhaust air is wet and loaded with 
particulates and other contaminants. Thus, the exhaust air 
is subjected to scrubbing and cooling to remove some of the 
particulates and water prior
