molding member (2) and a movable molding member (3); mirror 

plates (2d,3c) arranged to face each other between the 
stationary molding member and the movable molding 

member thereby to form a cavity for molding a disc; a 
stamper (7) arranged on at least one of the mirror plates 

for transferring recording information to the disc; a 
gate insert (10) arranged in a hollow portion between a 

gate leading to the cavity and an inlet port of a 
molten resin; a hot plunger (11) adapted to come into 

sliding contact with the gate insert (10) and heated and 
held; drive means (18) for moving back and forth the hot 

plunger to open/close the gate; an ejector mechanism (6)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sprueless disc 
mold and a disc molding method for injection-molding a 
recording medium disc substrate such as a video disc 
or a compact disc (as abbreviated to CD) having an 
opening at its center. Generally speaking, the disc substrate is 
manufactured by an injection-molding process using a 
disc mold. As shown in Fig. 11, this molding process 
is performed by charging a cavity 56, which is formed 
between a mirror plate 50 of a stationary molding 
member and a stamper 54 mounted on a mirror plate 52 
of a movable molding member, with a molten resin 
injected from the (not-shown) nozzle of an injector 
through a sprue hole 58. The stamper 54 is used to transfer the helical or 
concentric pits, which are formed with surface 
corrugations having a width of about 0.5 microns, as 
recording information data to the disc. This stamper 
54 is fixed by having its inner circumferential edge 
and outer circumferential edge held on the mirror 
plate 52 of the movable molding member by the flanged 
portion 60a of a stamper holder 60. After the molten resin charged in the mold has 
been solidified to a predetermined hardness, the disc 
substrate has its center opening 66 (as shown in Fig.  
 
12) punched out by a center punch 64 which is enabled 
to slide therein by using a sleeve 62 as a guide 
member. Here will be described a disc substrate 1 to be 
molded by the mold described above. The disc substrate 1 has its shape schematically 
shown in a top plan view and in a section in Figs. 12 
and 13. This disc is formed with at its center with 
the opening 55 and around this opening 66 with an 
annular groove 68 to be formed as a recess by the 
flanged portion of the stamper holder, and is divided 
across the annular groove 68 into a clamp area 70 at 
the inner side and a signal area 72 at the outer side. 
To this signal area 72, there are transferred by the 
stamper 54 the pits which are formed in the helical or 
concentric shape. Moreover, the disc substrate 1 is thus molded by 
an injection-molding apparatus and is then stacked on 
a stacker. In order that, in this case, the disc 
substrate may be prevented from contacting with and 
being damaged by another while promoting the heat 
dissipation from the substrates, each of these 
substrates is formed with an annular stack rib 80 on 
its back providing the recording information face. 
This stack rib 80 is formed either in a radially 
outward or inward offset from the annular groove 68 
arranged to face it on the surface or in
