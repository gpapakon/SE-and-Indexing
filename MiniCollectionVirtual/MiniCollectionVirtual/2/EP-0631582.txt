<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cyclic
silylureas and their preparation, to their
cyclosilazane starting materials and their
preparation, and to aminoalkylalkoxysilanes used to
make cyclosilazanes and their preparation. More
particularly, the present invention relates to cyclic
silylureas which retain the cyclosilazane ring
structure after formation. Cyclic silylureas of the
present invention are used as additives in
formulations for room temperature vulcanizing (RTV)
coatings, adhesives and sealants to impart fast cure
and reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) release,
such as the release of methanol.The US-A-3,146,250 describes nitrogen-containing
cyclic silanes, methods for their preparation
and methods for making nitrogen-containing siloxanes
from these compounds.There has been a continuing need in the
adhesives and sealant industry for faster-curing
silicone systems, allowing more rapid assembly of
full-strength articles of manufacture, including
automobiles. There has been a more recent need to
have such systems cure with lower, more
environmentally acceptable levels of volatile organic
compounds.Fast curing can be attained with systems
based on a polyfunctional silazane (i.e., compounds
with Si-N bonds) as curing agents. Such systems
typically cure by releasing low molecular weight
organic amines or ammonia, which are environmentally
undesirable because of unacceptable odor and 
toxicity. Cyclosilazanes and derivatives are
compounds with Si-N bonds which cure at high rates by
cleaving the Si-N bond without release of volatile
organic compounds.Cyclosilazanes have not achieved commercial
acceptance in the industry because of the inability
to produce them easily and in large quantity.
Earlier attempts at making even small quantities have
suffered from a combination of low efficiency and
high cost, coupled in some cases with generation of
high levels of hazardous waste by-products which
require costly disposal by incineration or
land-filling.Thus, there is a need for
cyclosilazane-based curing agents for silicone and
related adhesive systems which can be prepared in
commercial equipment with high efficiency at
practical cost of production and waste disposal, and
which provide high curing rates with reduced
generation of volatile organic compounds.
Surprisingly, that need is met by the cyclic
silylureas and cyclosilazanes of the present
invention.In accordance with the present invention
there is provided a class of cyclic silylureas and a
process of preparing them by contacting a
cyclosilazane
