<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a holder for use in 
combination with pre-filled cartridge-needle units having 

a proximal end and a needle (22) at the distal end 
thereof, the holder comprising a hollow body (36) sized 

for housing the cartridge-needle unit therein, means for 
permitting the body (36) to move axially relative to the 

cartridge-needle unit and for retaining the cartridge-needle 
unit within the holder; and a cap (40) for the 

proximal end of the cartridge-needle unit, wherein the 
cartridge-needle unit can be activated by application of 

force or torque to the cap (40). In a preferred 
embodiment, the cap (40) is tamper-evident and attached to 

the proximal end of the body (36). The holder reduces the 
susceptibility of health care workers to accidental needle 

strikes and enables the cartridge-needle unit to be 
activated safely and easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disposable holder for 
pre-filled cartridge-needle units containing means for 
activating the cartridge-needle unit. Disposable medicament-containing cartridge needle 
units for use in conjunction with reusable hypodermic 
syringe holders are well known in the art and in 
widespread commercial use. Such cartridges 
conventionally feature a cylindrical body closed at the 
proximal end with a flexible plunger slidable within the 
bore of the cartridge and closed at the distal necked-down 
end with a septum secured to the cartridge by a 
crimped-on aluminum collar. The necked-down distal end 
conventionally is fitted with a needle hub/needle/needle 
guard assembly. Such cartridge-needle units are 
available from Sanofi Winthrop Pharmaceuticals under the 
Carpuject® trademark. These units have satisfied widespread demand. 
However, on occasion, and for reasons which are not 
completely understood, a very small percentage of these 
units have experienced so-called 'plunger backout', 
i.e. the plunger slides towards the proximal end of the 
cartridge, sometimes exposing the sterile solution and 
thus rendering it unsuitable for use. Plunger backout 
tends to be exacerbated when the units are transported 
via air or used and/or stored in high altitude 
environments. Additionally, these units can be subject 
to unauthorized diversion of the medicaments contained 
therein. In use, the cartridge-needle unit must be 
activated, i.e. the proximal end of the needle cannula  
 
must penetrate the sealed septum such that communication 
is achieved between the fluid and the proximal end of 
the needle. When used in conjunction with conventional 
reusable syringe holders of the type described, for 
example, in Hadtke, U.S. Patent 4,585,445 and in 
EP-A-0 485,028, this is accomplished when the health 
care worker advances the cartridge through the holder by 
rotating a clamping element. Such reusable holders enable the user to avoid 
holding the cartridge-needle unit when the needle unit 
is exposed. Nevertheless, health care workers are 
especially susceptible to accidental and potentially 
infectious, and indeed, on occasion, possibly fatal, 
needle strikes due to the careless handling and/or 
disposing of the cartridge-needle unit after use. The 
consequences to health care workers of strikes from 
needles contaminated with various infectious diseases 
such as hepatitis or AIDS can be particularly severe. 
The frequency of such accidental needle strikes in the 
United States is surprisingly

<CLAIMS>
A disposable holder for use in combination 
with pre-filled cartridge-needle units having a proximal 

end and a needle (22) at the distal end thereof, said 
holder comprising: 

   a hollow body (36) sized for housing the 
cartridge-needle unit therein; 

   means (32,34) for permitting the body (36) to move 
axially relative to the cartridge-needle unit and for 

retaining the cartridge-needle unit within the holder; 
and 

   a cap (40) for the proximal end of said cartridge-needle 
unit, characterized in that said cartridge-needle 

unit can be activated by application of force to said 
cap (40). 
A holder as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
cap (40) is attached to the proximal end of said body by 

frangible tethers (42). 
A holder as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
cap (40) comprises a lever element (52). 
A holder as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
body (36) comprises male threads (54), and said cap (40) 

comprises female threads (55) adapted to be threaded 
onto said male threads (54). 
A holder as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said cartridge-needle unit 

comprises a circumferential ring (32) and said body (36) 
is squeezably deformable and comprises retaining slots 

(34) which accept said circumferential ring (32), 
positioned so that said needle (22) can be withdrawn 

into said body (36). 
A holder as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 4, wherein said cartridge-needle unit comprises a 

circumferential ring (32) and said body (36) comprises 
cam slots (39) which accept said ring (32), said 

slots (39) being positioned so that said needle (22) can 
be withdrawn into said body (36). 
A holder as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
cam slots (39) are triangular in shape. 
A disposable holder for use in combination 
with pre-filled cartridge-needle units having a proximal 

end and a needle (22) at the distal end thereof, said 
holder comprising:
