<ABSTRACT>
When developing development systems, one seeks to design software systems as modular as possible for controlling the communications system. This is also the aim in the case of a call processing system for controlling connections in a communications system. The basic structure of the disclosed call processing system has a signalling interface system and a call control system. Both systems are limited to the logical connection control and present their independent connection requests to a resource control system which carries out the physical connection control. The call processing system further has a coordination system for coordinating the so-called independent connection requests to the resource control system.

<CLAIMS>
Call processing system for controlling connections 
in a switching system, having the following features: 


a) a signalling interface system (ESIS) which forms the 
interface of the call processing system to the 

signalling type on which the respective connection 
ends are based, and carries out that part of the 

logic connection control which is dependent on the 
type of signalling, 
b) a call control system (CCS) which carries out that 
part of the logic connection control which is independent 

of the type of signalling, 
c) initialization of connection control processes at 
the physical level by corresponding connection 

requests to a resource control system (PSS, RHS), 
which connection requests are produced by the 

signalling interface system (ESIS) and the call 
control system (CCS) in a mutually independent 

manner, 
d) a coordination system (LSS) which coordinates the 
mutually independent connection requests submitted 

to the resource control system (PSS, RHS) by the 
signalling interface system and the call control 

system. 
Call processing system according to Claim 1,
 
characterized
 
in that the call control system (CCS) and the signalling 

interface system comprise a transient system having a 
plurality of transient modules,  

 

a) the transient modules dynamically producing in each 
case one chain of entities per connection, which 

entities communicate with one another by means of an 
information interface which is common to all the 

transient modules, 
b) an entity in each case autonomously carrying out a 
sub task of the logic connection control and in so 

doing, being able to submit corresponding autonomous 
connection requests to the resource control system 

PSS, RHS), via the coordination system (LSS). 
Call processing system according to Claim 2,
 
characterized
 
in that 


a) stimulation information which causes user actions is 
in each case initially received by the entities at 

the ends of a chain and, after carrying out a sub 
task corresponding to the entity, can be passed on 

along the chain. 
b) the position of an entity in the chain is defined by 
the function of its transient module. 
Call processing system according to Claim 2,
 
characterized
 
in that the call control system (CSS) additionally 

comprises a static system having a plurality of steady-state 
modules, a steady-state module receiving commands 

from the produced entities of a transient module and then 
carrying out that part of the control task of a transient 

module which is dependent on the structure of the data 
base. 
Call processing system according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized
 
in that the coordination system (LSS) comprises coordination 

modules (LSM), 

a) which receive and buffer store connection requests 
produced for an active connection end point (VEP) 

involved with a connection, 
b) which pass onto the resource control system (PSS,  
 

RHS) a connection request buffer stored by them when 
they have received control over an active connection 

end point (VEP), 
c) which give up control over a specific active connection 
end point (VEP) between one another in such a 

manner that only one coordination module has control 
over this active connection end point (VEP) at a 

specific point in time. 
Switching system having a call processing system 
according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized
 
in that it comprises a resource control system having a 

switching control system (PSS) and resource systems 
(RHS), 


a) the switching control system (PSS) controlling the 
connections at the physical level in a central 

manner and for this purpose receiving connection 
requests from the call processing system, while 
b) the resources systems (RHS) of the switching system 
control the respective resources locally and for 

this purpose receive commands from the switching 
control system (PSS). 
Switching system according to Claim 6, characterized
 
in that 


a) the switching control system (PSS) processes, independently 
of one another, the connection requests 

received from the call processing system, 
b) in the case of first connection requests, the 
switching control system (PSS) sets up a path envelope 

which includes data describing the switched 
path, 
c) the switching control system (PSS) transfers the 
said path envelope to the coordination system (LSS) 

after carrying out the connection request, 
d) the coordination system (LSS) stores the path envelope 
and also passes it to the switching control 

system (PSS) in the case of a later connection  
 

request. 
Switching system according to Claim 6,
 
characterized by 


a) a first group (GP4, GP5) of central control processors 
in which one central control processor in each 

case comprises a transient system according to 
Claim 2, a coordination system (LSS) and a switching 

control system (PSS), 
b) a common information interface of the transient 
modules, which is designed as an interprocessor 

information interface. 
Switching system according to Claim 8, characterized 
by
 
a second group (GP1, GP2, GP3) of central control processors, 

in which one central control processor in each case 
comprises a specific steady-state module of the static 

system according to Claim 4 and that part of the data 
base (DB) which is relevant to this steady-state module.
