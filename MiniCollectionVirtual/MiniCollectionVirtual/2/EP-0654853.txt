<ABSTRACT>
Female electrical contact element of the type made from a metal strip which is a good electrical conductor and has a degree of elasticity, the said strip being cut out and folded in order to have, at one end, means (4, 6) for fixing an electrical conductor, while the other end has the shape of a U with a central part (web) (11) and two side parts (flanges) (12, 12a), each side part, along its free edge, on the side opposite its free end, including a strip (16, 16a) folded over towards the inside of the U and extended towards the free end of the latter by a resilient (springy) strip piece (17, 17a) bent in such a way as to form a resilient clamp intended to grip against a male tab (blade terminal, tongue), characterised in that each resilient strip piece (17, 17a), on its face turned towards the corresponding side part (12, 12a), is integral with (fastened to) a complementary resilient tab (26).

<CLAIMS>
A female electric contact element of the type created from 
a good electricity conducting metallic strip and provided with 

a certain elasticity, said strip being cut out and folded to show 
at one extremity, means (4,6) for securing an electric conductor 

(5), whilst the other extremity assumes the shape of a U with a 
core sheet (11) and two wings (12,12a), each wing comprising 

along the length of its free edge, of the side turned towards the 
means (4,6) for securing an electrical conductor, a strip 

(16,16
a
) folded towards the interior of the U and extended from 
the side opposed to the securing means (4,6) of an electric 

conductor by a flexible rod (17,17
a
), arched in such a way as to 
constitute a flexible clamp intended to tightly hug a male 

tongue, characterised in that each flexible rod (17,17
a
) 
comprises a raised and secured, independent complimentary 

flexible tongue (26) on its surface turned towards the 
corresponding wing (12,12
a
). 
A female electric contact element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each flexible rod (17,17
a
) comprises 
dog points (21,21
a
) on its surface turned towards the 
corresponding wing, engaged in the holes (28) of the 

complimentary tongues (26), and whose free extremities are 
flared, each wing (12,12
a
) having a light (14,14
a
) to the right 
of the dog points (21,21
a
). 
A female electric contact element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each complimentary tongue (26,26
a
) is 
secured on the corresponding surface of each flexible rod 

(17,17
a
) by solder points. 
A female electric contact el√©ment according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the free extremities of wings (12,12
a
) and 
of the core sheet (11) comprise tips (13) folded down towards the 

interior of the U.  
 
A female electric contact element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the extremities of wings 12,12
a
) turned 
from the side of securing means (4,6) for an electric conductor, 

comprise an abutment (18,18
a
) extending into the interior of the 
U, perpendicularly to said wings.
