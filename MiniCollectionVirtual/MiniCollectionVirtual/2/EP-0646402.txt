<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process and apparatus for removing emissions 
originated in the manufacturing industry, especially from 

polymerization operations and thermoplastic polymer processing 
operations by collecting air containing the emissions, directing 

the air containing the emissions to a candle filter in a candle 
filter housing and rinsing the air containing the emissions within 

the candle filter with a solvent with an apparatus, which contains 
a header for collecting air, containing the emissions, a duct, a 

candle filter housing, which is connected to the header by the 
duct, a candle filter, located in the candle filter housing, which 

is connected to the duct, a nozzle for rinsing the candle filter 
with a solvent, which is connected to the candle filter, and a fan 

for moving the air through the header, duct, candle filter and 
candle filter housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process and apparatus 
for removing emissions, originated in the manufacturing industry 
like the chemical, pharmaceutical, coatings, recycling and oil 
industry. Especially it relates to a process and apparatus which is 
suitable for removing monomer and oligomer emissions from 
polymerization reactions and thermoplastic polymer processing 
operations. More specifically, it relates to a process and 
apparatus for removing monomer and oligomer emissions before, 
during and after the polymerization reaction for the manufacture of 
thermoplastic polymers and during thermoplastic polymer processing 
operations like extrusion, injection molding and fiber spinning 
operations. In the manufacturing industry, like the chemical, pharmaceutical, 
coating, recycling and oil industry, exists a broad variety of 
sources for emissions which are released in the environment, which 
is not desirable. For example, in chemical reactions, emissions of 
reaction components, additives and solvents may be released. 
During distillation, vapors of chemicals or solvents may be 
released. During coating of cars, vapors of coatings, additives 
and solvents may be released. During recycling of polymers , 
monomers or oligomers of the hydrolyzed polymer may be released. 
During cleaning of reactors, chemicals and solvents may be 
released.  Before, during and after the polymerization reaction for the 
manufacture of thermoplastic polymers like polyamides, polyester, 
polyolefins, polycarbonates, polystyrenes, polyacrylonitriles, 
polyurethanes, polysulfones, polyethysulfones, polyvinylchloride, 
copolymers and mixtures thereof, monomer vapors may be released in 
the environment from transportation tanks, storage tanks, 
pipelines, ducts, polymerization reactors, polymer melts, polymer 
strands water bath, cutters, dryers and the like, which is not 
desirable. During thermoplastic polymer processing like injection 
molding or extrusion the thermoplastic polymers are for example 
extruded through an extruder into strands for chip production or 
into films, fibers, profiles, tubes and the like. During the 
extrusion at a temperature of from about 180 to about 350Â°C, 
monomer or oligomer vapors, compounds formed by thermal 
evaporation, thermal decomposition, or vapors of additives are 
released from the surface of the extruded polymers, which are 
leaving the nozzle of the extruder. These vapors evaporate 
immediately into an aerosol that would form deposits in the 
neighborhood of the
