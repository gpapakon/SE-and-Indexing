<ABSTRACT>
A phosphor screen (7) comprising three color phosphor 
layers that emit red, green, and blue light is 

provided on the inner surface of a panel (1) of an 
envelope, and an in-line type electron gun assembly (6) 

for emitting three electron beams (5R, 5G, 5B) aligned 
on the same axis (generally a horizontal axis X) is 

mounted in a neck (3). This electron gun assembly (6) 
has three cathodes arranged in a row, and a plurality of 

electrodes for sequentially focusing and accelerating 
the electron beams from the respective cathodes toward 

the phosphor screen. A pair of belt-like magnetic segments 
(20) are provided on the outer wall of the neck of 

the envelope to serve as magnetic members for adjusting 
an external magnetic field. Each magnetic segment (20) 

is made of a hot-rolled silicon steel plate having a 
thickness of 0.35 mm, a width of 4 mm, and a length of 

40 mm in the direction of the tube axis. The magnetic 
segments (20) are arranged such that their centers in 

the longitudinal direction correspond to the cathodes on 
an electron beam alignment plane, and extend in the 

back-and-forth direction of the tube axis each by 20 mm 
about the cathodes (10) as the center. By these magnetic 

segments (20), a change in convergence caused by 
the external magnetic field can be suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode
ray tube and, more particularly, to an in-line type
color cathode ray tube having improved convergence
characteristics.Generally, as shown in FIG. 1, an in-line type
color cathode ray tube has an envelope constituted by a
panel 1 and a funnel 2 continuous to the panel 1. A
phosphor screen comprising three color phosphor layers
that emit red, green, and blue light, i.e., a screen 7
is formed on the inner surface of the panel 1, and a
shadow mask (not shown) is disposed to closely oppose
the phosphor screen 7. An in-line type electron gun
assembly 6 that emits three electron beams 5B, 5G, and
5R aligned on the same axis (generally, a horizontal
axis X) is incorporated in a neck 3 of the funnel 2. A
deflecting unit 4 is mounted on the outer portion of a
region extending from the funnel 2 to the neck 3. A
multipole field generating means PM for generating a
multipole field is mounted on the outer circumferential
surface of the neck 3. The three electron beams 5B, 5G,
and 5R emitted from the electron gun assembly 6 are
adjusted by the multipole field generating means PM so
that high color purity and convergence can be obtained
at the center of the screen. When the three electron
beams 5B, 5G, and 5R are deflected by the deflecting
unit 4 to scan the screen, a color image is reproduced 
on the phosphor screen 7.Usually, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the in-line
type electron gun assembly 6 has three cathodes 10B,
10G, and 10R, and a plurality of electrodes 11. The
three cathodes 10B, 10G, and 10R have heaters inserted
therein and are aligned in a row. The plurality of
electrodes 11 sequentially control, focus, and
accelerate the electron beams emitted from the cathodes
10B, 10G, and 10R toward the phosphor screen. The
electrodes 11 are integrally fixed together with the
three cathodes 10B, 10G, and 10R by an insulating
support 12. Each of the cathodes 10B, 10G, and 10R is
constituted by at least a cathode sleeve 13 having a
cathode element provided with an electron emitting portion
at one end portion thereof, a cathode cylinder 14
serving as a holding member for holding the cathode
sleeve 13, and a cathode strap 15 provided on the outer
circumferential surface of the cathode cylinder 14 to
surround it by about half its circumference. The two
ends of the cathode strap 15 are integrally fixed to the
insulating support 12 together with other electrodes.
In a large number of electron gun assembly, the electrodes
11 are made of a non-magnetic material, while a
magneti
