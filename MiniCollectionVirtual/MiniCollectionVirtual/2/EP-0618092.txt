<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle tyre with a tread profile which is provided with profile elements such as profile blocks or tread belts in which fine indents are arranged. By means of the fine indents (2, 2', 2'', 12, 12') individual elements which have at least approximately the shape of a double-T carrier are formed in the profile elements (1, 1', 11, 11', 21).

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle tyre, having a tread surface profile 
which includes profile elements, such as profile blocks 

or tread strip bands which extend in the circumferential 
direction of the tyre and are provided with a plurality 

of fine incisions, characterised in that profile 
elements (1, 1', 11, 11', 21) are provided with fine 

incisions (2, 2', 2'', 12, 12'), which form individual 
elements having at least approximately a double-T-shaped 

configuration. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that profile blocks are disposed in the tread strip 

profile and include a single individual element having 
at least approximately a double-T-shaped configuration. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the tread strip profile includes profile blocks 

(1, 1', 11, 11', 21), which are each provided with a 
plurality of individual elements having at least 

approximately a double-T-shaped configuration, at least 
two individual elements at a time being so disposed that 

one bar member lies in the space between the bar members 
of the second individual element. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that at least one tread strip band (4) is disposed 

in the tread strip profile, and the individual elements, 
which have at least approximately a double-T-shaped 

configuration, are disposed in said band in two rows 
which extend in the circumferential direction, the 

double-T-shaped individual elements communicating 
directly with one another within each row, and every two 

bar members of individual elements, which directly 
succeed one another in the one row when viewed with  

 
respect to the circumferential direction, are disposed 

with an accurate fitting between the bar members of the 
individual elements of the other row. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the profile block edges, or 

respectively the tread strip band edges, partially form 
the outlines of the double-T-shaped individual elements. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the double-T-shaped individual 

elements, which are disposed internally of a profile 
block or a tread strip band, have at least substantially 

identical dimensions.
