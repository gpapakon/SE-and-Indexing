<ABSTRACT>
In built-in ceiling luminaires a cover ring or also a luminaire insert having light-shaping elements is often provided in the light exit opening, which have to be removed for lamp replacement or for other maintenance for the inside of the luminaire to become accessible. This is to be made possible in a simple manner and in a way which does not require any tools and facilitates maintenance. For this purpose, a guide element (11) is provided for fastening the luminaire insert (10) and/or the cover ring (102). Said guide element is mounted on the luminaire housing (2) so as to be displaceable in an axially parallel manner and carries at the free end the luminaire insert which is fastened rotatably and can be pivoted out laterally in the disengaged state. In the engaged state, the luminaire insert is centred at the luminaire housing and releaseably locked by means of locking elements (14, 15, 114). The solution can be used in the case of all ceiling luminaires which have to be serviced from the underside of the ceiling.

<CLAIMS>
Ceiling-recessed light fixture having a light 
source (6), which is arranged in a main reflector (7), 

and a light fixture insert unit (10) which is arranged 
underneath the light source and covers it, is detachably 

fastened to a light fixture housing (2) and contains 
technical lighting elements, a guide element (11) being 

provided on the light fixture housing (2) for the attachment 
of the light fixture insert unit (10), characterized 

in that this guide element is mounted on the light 
fixture housing in the direction of the main beam axis of 

the ceiling-recessed light fixture so as to be longitudinally 
displaceable as far as an extended limit position, 

and the light fixture insert unit is attached to its end 
which is remote from the housing in an asymmetrical and 

rotationally movable fashion, the length of this guide 
element being dimensioned with respect to the recessing 

depth of the light fixture insert unit in such a way that 
in the extended state the light fixture insert unit can 

be pivoted away from the ceiling opening, and that 
latching means (14, 114, 114', 15) are provided with 

which, in the retracted state, the light fixture insert 
unit is detachably fastened to the light fixture housing. 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the latching means (14, 114, 

114', 15) comprise at least one elastically deformable 
element (15) which is fastened to the light fixture 

housing (2) and latches to the light fixture insert unit 
(10), or is fastened to the light fixture insert unit 

(10), with prestressing and latches to the light fixture  
 

housing (2) with sprung prestressing. 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to Claim 
2, characterized in that an inner flange (103) which is 

arranged on the reflector side and in whose edge the 
guide element (11) is mounted in a rotationally movable 

fashion, but is arranged so as to be axially fixed, is 
provided on the light fixture insert unit (10). 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to one 
of the preceding claims, characterized by a bearing 

bracket (12) which is bent in a U shape, is secured to 
the light fixture housing (2) and in whose legs coaxial 

receiving holes are provided as guide surfaces for the 
guide element (11). 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to one 
of the preceding claims, characterized in that the light 

fixture housing (2) has a flange (220) and the latter has 
a through-hole (for example 17) for the guide element 

(11), in that a latching spring (15) is arranged on this 
housing flange (220) so as to cover the through-hole, and 

in that a groove-shaped neck (114) which runs radially 
all around is provided, into which neck (114) the latching 

spring engages in the retracted state of the light 
fixture insert unit (10). 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to Claim 
5, characterized in that further guide elements (14) are 

provided as centring means and further latching means on 
the flange (103) of the light fixture insert unit (10), 

rotationally symmetrically with respect to the guide 
element (11), said further guide elements (14) engaging 

in a centring fashion in corresponding receiving holes 
(17) in the flange (220) of the light fixture housing 

(2). 
Ceiling-recessed light fixture according to Claim 
6, characterized in that these further guide elements 

(14) are each assigned a further latching spring (15).
