<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel composition. More
particularly, this invention relates to a fuel
composition containing an aliphatic amine and a polyalkyl
hydroxyaromatic compound.It is well known in the art that liquid hydrocarbon
combustion fuels, such as fuel oils and gasolines, tend to
exhibit certain deleterious characteristics, either after
long periods of storage or under actual operational
conditions. Gasolines, for example, in operational use tend
to deposit sludge and varnish at various points in the power
system, including the carburetor or injectors and the intake
valves. It is desirable, therefore, to find a means for
improving liquid hydrocarbon fuels by lessening their
tendency to leave such deposits.U.S. Patent No. 3,849,085 discloses a motor fuel composition
comprising a mixture of hydrocarbon in the gasoline boiling
range containing about 0.01 to 0.25 volume percent of a high
molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbon substituted phenol in
which the aliphatic hydrocarbon radical has an average
molecular weight in the range of about 500 to 3,500. This
patent teaches that gasoline compositions containing a minor
amount of an aliphatic hydrocarbon, substituted phenol not
only prevents or inhibits the formation of intake valve and
port deposits in a gasoline engine but also enhances the
performance of the fuel composition in engines designed to
operate at higher operating temperatures with a minimum of 
decomposition and deposit formation in the manifold of the
engine.U.S. Patent No. 4,134,846 discloses a fuel additive
composition comprising a mixture of (1) the reaction product
of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol,
epichlorohydrin and a primary or secondary mono- or
polyamine, and (2) a polyalkylene phenol. This patent
teaches that such compositions show excellent carburetor,
induction system and combustion chamber detergency and, in
addition, provide effective rust inhibition when used in
hydrocarbon fuels at low concentrations.U.S. Patent No. 4,231,759 discloses a fuel additive
composition comprising the Mannich condensation product of
(1) a high molecular weight sulfur-free alkyl-substituted
hydroxyaromatic compound wherein the alkyl group has a
number average molecular weight of about 600 to 3,000 (2) an
amine containing at least one active hydrogen atom, and (3)
an aldehyde, wherein the respective molar ratio of reactants
is 1:0.1-10 : 0.1-10.The present invention provides a novel fuel
composition comprising a major amount of hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline or diesel
