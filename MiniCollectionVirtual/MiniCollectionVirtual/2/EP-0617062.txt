<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers of aryl phosphonic acids can be made in a 
bulk polymerisation process with unsaturated monomeric 

hydrocarbons. Preferred are alpha-phenyl vinyl phosphonic 
acid and styrene. Bulk polymerisation process avoids 

suspending agents, emulsifying agents or water. Absence of 
halogen avoids environmental problems. A free radical 

initiator is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulk polymerisation method and in particular to 
the bulk copolymerisation of an aryl - substituted phosphonic acid having 
some unsaturation and an unsaturated hydrocarbon monomer. The present invention also relates to copolymers produced by means of the 
aforesaid method and to their use, in the form of processed plastics 
materials or of powders, as flame-retardants. It is known to prepare copolymers of certain aryl - substituted phosphonate 
esters and unsaturated monomers by means of suspension polymerisation, 
emulsion-polymerisation and solution-polymerisation. Some of these 
copolymers are capable of being processed to form transparent plastics 
materials and, in addition, some of the copolymers are inherently 
flame-retardant. We have now found that copolymers of superior processing and flame-retardant 
qualities can be made in a bulk-polymerisation process from aryl - 
substituted phosphonic acids and unsaturated hydrocarbon monomers. Bulk 
polymerisation (ie absence of suspending agent, emulsifying agent or water) 
results in a quicker and more efficient reaction. The absence of halogen 
from the reaction avoids environmental problems. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the production of a 
copolymer of an aryl - substituted phosphonic acid containing at least one 
unsaturated carbon-to-carbon bond and an unsaturated hydrocarbon monomer, in 
which the phosphonic acid and the monomer are subjected to bulk 
polymerisation in the presence of a free-radical initiator. The present invention also provides a copolymer produced by the method 
described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and further provides the 
use of such a copolymer as a flame-retardant.  The method of bulk polymerisation according to the present invention may 
suitably include the following steps: 
(a) heating a mixture of the phosphonic acid with sufficient of the 
unsaturated monomer to dissolve the acid but insufficient to cause 
significant homopolymerisation of the monomer; (b) further heating the mixture (a) under an inert atmosphere; (c) adding thereto a quantity of the free-radical initiator; (d) further heating the mixture (a) and the free-radical initiator; (e) adding, in a dropwise manner, the required stoichiometric quantity of 
the unsaturated monomer (in which is dissolved a further quantity of 
the free-radical initiator) to bring about substantially complete 
copolymerisation; (f) further heating the phosphonic acid, the monomer and the free-radical 
initiator
