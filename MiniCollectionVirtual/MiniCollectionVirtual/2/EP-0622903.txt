<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes an input buffer circuit (10) having 
sleep mode and bus hold capability. An input section (11) of the 

buffer circuit is operated from an operating voltage which is lower 
than a supply voltage of the buffer circuit thereby minimizing the 

static power dissipation. Sleep mode circuitry (15, 36, 38) is 
included for effectively disconnecting an input signal from the rest 

of the buffer circuit thereby minimizing dynamic power 
dissipation. Bus hold circuitry (40) is included for holding the 

logic state appearing at an output of the input buffer circuit when 
the input signal is removed thereby further reducing the static 

power dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to electrical 
circuits, and more particularly, to a novel input buffer having sleep 
mode and bus hold for providing low static and dynamic power 
dissipation. In the past, a variety of circuit configurations have been 
utilized to provide complementary metal oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) circuits which are capable of accepting transistor-transistor 
logic (TTL) voltage levels. The semiconductor industry 
has also combined CMOS with bipolar to form BICMOS circuits 
having TTL compatible inputs. One notable disadvantage of most, if 
not all, such prior circuits is the amount of power dissipated by 
the circuits' input stage. The voltage value of a TTL signal 
generally varies over a large range, and often drops to a level that 
is insufficient to disable the prior circuits' input transistors. 
When this occurs, excessive power is dissipated in the form of 
leakage current flowing through these input transistors. There have been attempts to minimize the static power 
dissipation of an input stage. For example, a circuit for lowering 
the operating potential of the input transistors of the circuit and 
then restoring the voltage level at the output of the circuit is fully 
described in US patent application having U.S. Patent No. 5,276,362 
and issue date of January 4, 1994. Although the circuit minimizes 
static power dissipation, it does not, however, minimize the 
dynamic power dissipation nor does it provide a sleep mode or a 
bus hold function Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a circuit that has an 
input which operates with a TTL input signal, that has low static 
and dynamic power dissipation, and that has the capability of 
operating in a sleep mode and a bus hold function.  FIG. 1 is a detailed schematic/block diagram illustrating an 
embodiment of an input buffer circuit having sleep mode and bus 
hold circuitry in accordance with the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a more detailed schematic diagram illustrating an 
embodiment of the bus hold circuitry in accordance with the 
present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated input buffer circuit 
10 having sleep mode and bus hold circuitry incorporated therein. 
Circuit 10 provides translation of a TTL level signal appearing at 
terminal 16 to a CMOS level signal at an output 33 of circuit 10. 
Also included in circuit 10 is an input circuit 11 and a level shifter 
18 wherein level shifter 18 may be, for example, a schottky diode. 
It is worth noting that circuit 10 may be utilized to
