<ABSTRACT>
In a demodulator for radio data signals, the transmission of which is carried out by phase shift keying of a suppressed auxiliary carrier, a multiplex signal containing the auxiliary carrier-frequency signal being conducted via a band pass filter and an amplitude limiter, the amplitude-limited carrier-frequency signal is sampled at a sampling frequency which is a multiple of the frequency of the auxiliary carrier. The samples are added together over a predetermined part of in each case one period of the auxiliary carrier. The samples added together are supplied to a digital signal processing circuit.
