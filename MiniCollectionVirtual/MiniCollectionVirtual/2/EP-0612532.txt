<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a vaccine which contains, per
dose, an effective immunizing amount of a modified feline

enteric coronavirus and a suitable carrier. The vaccine of
this invention may also contain an adjuvant, an effective

immunizing amount of a second modified virus and a an
effective immunizing amount of a modified bacteria.

Additionally provided by this invention is a method of
immunizing a dog against disease caused by canine

coronavirus involving administering to the dog a dose of
the vaccine of this invention. The method of this

invention may also involve administering one or more
additional doses of vaccine to the dog, immunizing the dog

against disease caused by a second virus and immunizing the
dog against disease caused by a bacteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and 
are composed of a single genus of large, enveloped viruses 
which infect a variety of mammalian and avian species. 
The virus is heat labile but acid stable which contributes 
to the ability to survive passage through the stomach. 
Virions of most coronaviruses contain three proteins: the 
phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, N; a small membrane 
embedded glycoprotein, M; and a large petal-shaped peplomer 
glycoprotein, S. The M protein is synthesized on ribosomes 
bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and accumulates in 
the Golgi apparatus and is believed to determine the site 
of virus budding from the infected cell. The S protein 
mediates many of the biological properties of the virus, 
such as attachment to cell receptors, penetration, cell-fusion, 
and is the major target for virus-neutralizing 
antibodies. A proportion of the S glycoprotein which is 
not incorporated into virions is transported to the plasma 
membrane of the cell where it remains bound to the surface 
of the cell. Canine coronavirus (CCV) was first reported by Binn et 
al. (1) The isolate was recovered from dogs suffering from 
diarrhea during an epizootic in Germany. Keenan etal. (2) 
reported that the isolated virus was capable of inducing 
intestinal lesions in susceptible neonatal puppies. CCV gastroenteritis in dogs is highly contagious, and 
following exposure, the virus rapidly spreads throughout 
the small intestine. The incubation period is generally 24 
to 48 hours but has been as long as one to four days, as 
reported by Keenan etal. (2) Following oral exposure, the 
virus enters and colonizes in the upper duodenum. Viral  
 
replication results and the infection then proceeds 
caudally throughout the entire small intestine within days. 
As a result of the enteritis, the CCV may also spread 
locally to the regional mesenteric lymph nodes. The replication of the CCV is localized within the 
digestive and absorptive cells that are located in the 
upper two-thirds of the intestinal villi. The viral 
replication causes death and desquamation of the intestinal 
epithelial cells resulting in shortening of the intestinal 
villi. The desquamating cells containing infectious virus 
are a source of infection for more caudal segments of the 
intestines and the feces. Loss of digestive enzymes and 
absorptive capacity results in diarrhea, and dehydration of 
puppies. Deaths have occurred within as little as 24 to 36 
hours after onset of clinical signs despite good

that the effective immunizing amount of the modified feline 

enteric coronavirus is an amount which contains greater than 
about 5 micrograms of S viral antigen. 
The vaccine of claim 1, further characterized in 
that the modified feline enteric coronavirus is an 

inactivated feline enteric coronavirus. 
The vaccine of claim 3, further characterized in 
that the inactivated feline enteric coronavirus virus is 

inactivated by contacting the virus with an agent selected 
from the group consisting of binary ethylenimine, formalin or 

Î²-propriolactone. 
The vaccine of claim 1, further characterized by 
having an adjuvant in an amount effective to enhance the 

immunogenicity of the modified feline enteric coronavirus. 
The vaccine of claim 5, further characterized in 
that the adjuvant is selected from the group consisting of
 
aluminum hydroxide, saponin or aluminum phosphate. 
The vaccine of claim 5, further characterised in 
that the effective amount of the adjuvant is from about 3 % 

by volume of the dose to about 10 % by volume of the dose. 
The vaccine of claim 1, further characterized by 
having an effective immunizing amount of a second modified 

virus. 
The vaccine of claim 8, further characterized in 
that the second modified virus is a modified canine 

adenovirus, modified canine parvovirus, modified canine 
parainfluenza virus or a modified canine herpesvirus. 
The vaccine of claim 1, further characterized by 
having an effective immunizing amount of a modified bacteria. 
The vaccine of claim 10, further characterized in 
that the modified bacteria is a modified Leptospira. 
A method of immunizing a dog against disease caused 
by canine coronavirus characterized by administering to the 

dog a dose of the vaccine of claim 1.
