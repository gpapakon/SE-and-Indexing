<ABSTRACT>
A signal processing circuit (23) for use in a control system for an internal 
combustion engine receives a first series of signals from a first transducer 

(25, 26) driven by the engine crankshaft and a second series of signals 
from a second transducer (28, 29). The signals of the first series occur at 

short intervals of time and those of the second series at relatively long 
intervals and serve as engine cylinder identification signals. The signals 

of the second series include a further signal which occurs a 
predetermined time before one of the identification signals to provide an 

engine position signal. The processing circuit (23) supplies the cylinder 
identification signals and the engine position signal separately to a 

microprocessor based engine control system and it is constructed to 
supply artificial identification signals and an artificial position signal in 

the event of failure of the second transducer, the artificial signals being 
derived from the signals of the first series.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal processing circuit for use in a control 
system of an internal combustion engine, the processing circuit in use 
receiving a first series of signals from a first transducer, the signals of the 
first series occurring at relatively small intervals of engine crankshaft 
rotation and a second series of signals from a second transducer, the 
signals of the second series occurring at relatively large intervals of 
rotation of the engine crankshaft, and serving as engine cylinder 
identification signals, the signals of the second series including a further 
signal which occurs a predetermined interval before one of the engine 
cylinder identification signals and which acts as an engine position 
signal. The supply of the first and second series of signals to an internal 
combustion engine control system is well known in the art and the 
control system on the basis of the above signals and further signals 
supplied to it determines in the case of a compression ignition engine, 
which cylinder is to receive fuel and the timing and duration of fuel 
delivery. In a known system the first transducer is associated with a disk or wheel 
which is driven by the engine crankshaft and the periphery of the disk 
defines teeth which are spaced at 6 degree intervals. The second 
transducer is associated with a disk or wheel which in the case of a four 
stroke engine is driven at half engine speed by the camshaft of the 
engine, and has a number of equi-spaced teeth equal in number to the 
number of engine cylinders with an additional tooth to provide the 
engine position signal, the additional tooth being say 15Â° in front of one 
of the aforesaid teeth.  
 EP-A-203575 and DE-A-4040828 show known systems for providing 
engine cylinder identification and engine position detection and which 
also provide for engine operation in the even of transducer failure. Modern control systems are microprocessor based and it has been the 
practice to separate the cylinder identification signals and the engine 
position signal using suitable software. In order to ease the software 
overhead it is proposed to separate the so-called "N" signals which 
identify the cylinders and the so-called "+1" signal which represents the 
engine position, in a hardware signal processing circuit. It is also 
proposed that the processing circuits should generate artificial "N" signals 
and an artificial "+1" signal to the control system. According to the present invention there is provided a signal processing 
circuit for
