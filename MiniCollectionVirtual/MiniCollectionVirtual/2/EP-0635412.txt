The invention relates to an entry step (1) for the driver's cab of a goods vehicle, with integrated reservoir (6) for a fluid which serves to clean windscreens and/or headlights. According to the invention, the reservoir (6) is installed standing above an entry step (3) in the entry box, at least largely forming its rear wall. Furthermore, the filling opening of the reservoir (6) which can be closed by a simple cap (24) is arranged at its highest point a large distance to the rear of the side wall (5) of the entry box and is easily accessible from the outside of the entry step (1) for filling processes.

Entry to the cab of a truck with integrated reservoir for a fluid for cleaning 
the windscreen and/or the headlights, characterised in that the reservoir (6) 

is installed vertically above a step (3) in the entry box and forms a large 
portion of the rear wall of said entry box and that the filler hole of said 

reservoir is located at the topmost position very far in the rear towards the 
rear side wall (5) of the entry box and can be closed with a simple cap (24) 

and is accessible for filling operations from the outside of the entry (1). 
Entry according to Claim 1, characterised in that in its installation position 
the reservoir (6) extends at least partially into the rear wall (4) of the entry 

box where said rear wall is recessed (7) towards the centre of the vehicle. 
Entry according to Claim 2, characterised in that a part (8) of the bottom 
side of the reservoir (6) is positively supported on the bottom face (9) of 

the recessed portion (7) which forms an obtuse angle of approximately 60° 
to 80° with the rear wall (10) of said recessed portion (7). 
Entry according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that the 
rear side wall (13) (as viewed in forward driving direction) of the reservoir 

(6) runs approximately parallel to, is adjacent to and supported on the rear 
side wall (5) of the entry box. 
Entry according to one of the Claims 2 and 3, characterised in that between 
the step (3) of the entry box and the bottom area (9) of the recessed portion 

(7) a connecting vertical portion (14) of the rear wall (4) has such a height 
and that that portion (15) of the reservoir bottom side which freely 

protrudes from the recessed portion (7) points upwards and outwards at 
such an oblique angle that a sufficiently large space of trapezoidal cross 

section is provided for the insertion of the tip of a shoe of a person stepping 
on the entry step. 
Entry according to Claim 1, characterised in that the rear wall (16) of the 
reservoir (6) is provided with an inward recess (17) in which an electric 

pump (18) is installed for supplying cleaning fluid to the cleaning points on 
the vehicle.  

 
Entry according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that on its 
outer wall (20) facing the outside of the entry (1) the reservoir (6) is 

provided with fluid level indicator (21) at which the actual fluid level can 
be permanently read off from the outside of the entry (1). 
Entry according to Claim 1, characterised in that the filler hole of the 
reservoir (6) is located at the topmost point of a filler neck (23) which is 

positioned close to the rear side wall (5) of the entry box on the upper side 
(22) of the reservoir (6) and leads upwards at an oblique angle towards the 

outside of the entry (1).
