<ABSTRACT>
Protective device (guard) for entries to ovens, which incorporates a plurality of transparent plates fitted close together and which are fastened via their ends to support means which are joined together with the possibility of pivoting and which live in guides parallel to the entry flanks of the oven; it being possible for the support means to be moved inside the guides manually or automatically so that the plates are concealed in one of the flanks of the oven, leaving the entrance thereto free. This guard is used to cover the entry of the oven by means of removable plates, preventing direct access to the inside of this oven.
