<ABSTRACT>
The thermoplastic compositions include polymethyl methacrylate which has a percentage of syndiotactic triads which is higher than or equal to 70 % and a reinforcing additive of multilayer structure in which at least one of the layers consists of an acrylic elastomer. The compositions are transparent, impact-resistant and have an improved heat resistance.

<CLAIMS>
Impact-resistant transparent thermoplastic 
compositions comprising methyl methacrylate polymer which 

has a percentage of syndiotactic triads which is higher 
than or equal to 70 %, obtained by anionic polymerization 

in the presence of an initiator system comprising an 
initiator and an alkali metal alcoholate containing an 

alkoxy group, and a reinforcing additive of multilayer 
structure, at least one of the layers consisting of an 

elastomer. 
Compositions in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized in that they comprise between 40 % and 99 % 

by weight of methyl methacrylate polymer, and from 1 % to 
60 % of reinforcing additive. 
Compositions in accordance with either of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the PMMA has a 

syndiotactic triad content higher than or equal to 78 %. 
Compositions in accordance with any one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the reinforcing additive 

includes at least one elastomeric layer based on 
polyalkyl acrylate or polyalkoxyalkyl acrylate in which 

the alkyl group has from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. 
Heat- and impact-resistant articles comprising a 
composition in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4. 
Articles according to Claim 5, obtained by 
extrusion, or injection or other moulding.
