<ABSTRACT>
A carrier (10) containing a plurality of layers of articles arranged in stacked end-to-end fashion. The carrier is fully enclosed and includes side end panel flaps (26) which extend substantially the entire distance from the top panel to the bottom panel of the carrier to strengthen the carrier and prevent bowing of the panels. Score lines in the side end panel flaps further prevent bowing during folding. The top panel (14) is formed by overlapping top panel flaps (16, 18), the inner top panel flap including a folded-under reinforcing flap which produces an area of triple thickness between handle openings in the flaps and which extends into the end panels for additional reinforcement purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carriers which are adapted to
contain a plurality of articles. More particularly, it
relates to a carrier which is adapted to carry a plurality
of layers of articles in stacked end-to-end relationship.Sleeve-type carriers are commonly used to package
beverage cans and other types of articles, and are
typically formed from paperboard blanks which have been
folded into collapsed sleeve form. Each collapsed sleeve is
opened by a packaging machine, and cans or other articles
are introduced through one or both of the open ends of the
sleeve, after which the end panel flaps are folded and
secured together. The cans are normally introduced in
upright position while the carrier sleeve is supported on
one of its side panels, with the open ends of the sleeve
facing out, transverse to the direction of movement of the
sleeves through the machine, to receive the cans. The
resulting carrier contains a layer of cans the ends of
which are located adjacent the side panels of the carrier.
Additionally, a handle is normally incorporated into the
top panel of the carrier to facilitate lifting and
carrying.A typical embodiment of such a prior art sleeve type
carrier is disclosed for example in US-A-3994432. It
comprises a bottom panel, two side panels, a top panel
formed from two top panel flaps and two end panels formed
from adhered flaps connected to the top, bottom and side
panels along fold lines.Although such carriers have been designed to contain
varying numbers of articles, typical beverage can packages
as the above indicated one hold only six or twelve cans.
This is partly because a conventional sleeve-type carrier
would be quite long if its length were increased to
accommodate large numbers of cans, and would be unwieldy to 
carry. Further, the heavier load caused by the additional
cans would tend to promote tearing, particularly in the
handle area.One way to overcome some of the problems associated
with packaging large numbers of cans in a carrier is to
package them in stacked layers. This would make the package
more compact and would not increase its size to the point
where it could not be readily handled. For example, if
twenty-four standard 12-fluid ounce cans are packaged in a
carrier disclosed in WO93/15971 - which document however
has been published only after the priority date of the
subject application - in two layers containing twelve cans
each, with each layer being four can diameters long and
three can diameters wide, the length of the carrier is the
same as the length of a
