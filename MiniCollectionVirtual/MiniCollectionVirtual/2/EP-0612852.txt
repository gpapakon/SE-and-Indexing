<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing high-strength bainitic steel 
rails with an excellent rolling-contact fatigue resistance 

comprising the steps of hot rolling steel containing 0.15 % 
to 0.45 % carbon, 0.15 % to 2.00 % silicon, 0.30 % to 2.00 % 

manganese, 0.50 % to 3.00 % chromium, and at least one 
element selected from a group of molybdenum, nickel, copper, 

niobium, vanadium, titanium and boron, subjecting the hot-rolled 
rail to an accelerated cooling from the austenite 

region to a temperature between 500° to 300° C, at which the 
accelerated cooling is stopped, at a rate of 1° to 10° C per 

second, and then further cooling the rail to a lower temperature 
by natural or controlled cooling. The obtained rail 

exhibits a hardness of Hv 300 to 400 in the center of the 
rail head surface of the head and not lower than Hv 350 in 

the gage corner, and the hardness of the gage corner is 
higher than that of the center of the rail head surface by 

Hv 30 or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for manufacturing
high-strength bainitic steel rails having a head surface
with excellent rolling-contact fatigue resistance required
of the rails used in high-speed railroads, and more particularly
to high-strength rails having a bainitic structure
resistant to fatigue cracks that could occur in the gage
corner between the head and the sides of rails and the squat
or dark spot appearing at the top plane of the rail head
surface and processes for manufacturing such rails.Recently the weight of loads carried and speed of
travel have been improved to increase the efficiency of railroad
transportation. Thus, railroad rails are now subjected
to more severe service conditions and, therefore, required
to have higher quality.Concrete problems include a sharp increase in the wear
of rails installed in curves and the incidence of fatigue
crack developing from the interior of the gage corner which
is the principal contact point of rails with the wheels of
trains running thereover.The following solutions have been employed for the 
problems just described:
(1) As-rolled rails of alloyed steels prepared by adding
large quantities of copper, molybdenum and other alloying
elements. (Refer to Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
No. JP-A-140316 of 1975 (US-A-4 008 078).)(2) Heat-treated rails of non-alloyed steels manufactured
by applying accelerated cooling (by air-mist cooling)
to the head or entirety of the rail between 700° and 550° C
(Refer to Japanese Patent Publication No. JP-B-55-23885 of 1980.)(3) Heat-treated rails of low-alloy steels having improved
wear and fatigue crack resistance and capability to
form harder welds prepared by the addition of lower percentage
of alloying elements. (Refer to Japanese Patent Publication
No. JP-B-59-19173 of 1984.)These high-strength rails are made of steels having
bainitic, ferritic and fine-pearlitic structures to improve
their resistance to wear and resistant inner fatigue defects.In tangent and gently curved tracks of railroads where
not much resistance to wear and inner fatigue defects is required,
repeated contacts between wheels and rails cause
rolling-contact fatigue failures on the rail head surface.
This results rolling contact fatigue or transverse defects
resulting from the propagation of fatigue cracks started at
the top plane of the rail head surface into the interior 
thereof. The failures called "squat" or "dark spot" that
appears mainly in the tangent tracks of high-speed railroads
is a typical example. Although the
