<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to roll shuttering as used, for example, in tunnel linings. Measures to improve force transmission and centring between the deflecting elements (6) and the shuttering skin (7), to attach side shuttering (31, 32), to improve the drive of the deflection elements (6) and to mount the shuttering head on one side are proposed. A high surface quality of the layer (1) to be applied is achieved by the proposed measures, and lateral oozing out of the layer to be applied in the state in which it has still not set is effectively prevented by means of the side shuttering (31, 32).

Support arrangement for supporting a layer (1) of a
settable mixture applied to a wall (2), in the not yet

self-supportingly set condition of the mixture,

consisting of a shell skin (7), spanned between two turning
elements (6), which shell skin offers, in the region

between the turning elements (6), a shuttering-like support
surface (5), whereby
the shell skin (7) is of a non-elastic material and has on
the side adjacent the applied layer (1) a smooth surface

constitution,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) has, on the side away from the applied
layer (1), guide elements (27) which engage into

counterparts (29) which are provided on the turning
elements (6).
Support arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) is formed of steel or plastics bands, in
particular teflon bands.
Support arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) is of plastics bands, in particular
teflon bands, applied to a carrier material without

discontinuities.
Support arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) is of plastics bands, in particular
teflon bands, connected with one another in a staggered

manner, free from discontinuities.
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that,
 
there is arranged on the side of the shell skin (7) away

from the applied layer (1) a support element (9) the
curvature of which is adapted to the contour of the wall

(2).
Support arrangement according to claim 5,

characterised in that,

the support element (9) has suitable counterparts (28) into
which the guide elements (27) of the shell skin (7) engage.
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that,

the guide elements (27) are rivets, which engage into
grooves (28, 29) of the turning elements (6) and, if

applicable, of the support element (9).
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterised by

a flexibly mounted, shuttering-like side support (31, 32)
which supports the settable mixture at least in the region

of a side line of the support surface (5) between the wall
(2) and the shell skin (7), and
a pressing arrangement which presses the flexibly mounted
side supports (31-34) elastically against the unevennesses

of the wall (2), following these unevennesses, so that the
region between the shell skin (7) and the wall (2) is

substantially completely closed along at least one side
line of the support surface (5).
Support arrangement according to claim 8,

characterised in that,

the side support (31, 32) is constituted by means of one or
more rotatable discs (31), which roll along the wall.
Support arrangement according to claim 9,

characterised in that,

a plurality of overlapping discs (31
1
, 31
2
), arranged 
interleaved, are provided.
Support arrangement according to anyone of claims 8 to
10,

characterised in that,

the side supports are attached to the support arrangement
by means of sprung telescopic and/or swing arms (34, 33).
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
11,

characterised in that,

there is provided a drive arrangement (8, 25) for advancing
the support arrangement by means of rotation of at least

one of the turning elements (6), whereby the advancing
force from the drive arrangement is such that the static

friction between the shell skin (7) and the applied layer
(1) is not overcome.
Support arrangement according to claim 12,

characterised in that,

the drive arrangement (8, 25) includes an electric motor
with variable torque, in particular a squirrel cage

induction motor with phase control (winding motor).
Support device according to any of claims 1 to 13,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) is a band circulating endlessly around
both turning elements (6).
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
13,

characterised in that,

the shell skin (7) is wound off from a wind-off drum (26
1
),
turned around the turning elements (6), and wound up onto

a wind-up drum (26
2
).
Support device according to claim 15,
 
characterised in that,

one of the turning elements is constituted as wind-off drum
(26
1
) and the other turning element is constituted as wind-up
drum (26
2
).
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
16,

characterised in that,

the turning elements (6) and, if applicable, the wind-off
and wind-up drums (26
1
, 26
2
) are so mounted on one side that
an exchange of the shell skin is possible at the non-mounted

side.
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
17,

characterised in that,

the support arrangement is guided in a guide frame (23)
running at a predetermined spacing from the wall (2).
Support arrangement according to claim 18,

characterised in that,

the drive arrangement (25) is arranged on the guide frame
(23) and the advancing movement can be transferred via a

carrier construction (13) to at least one of the turning
elements (6).
Support arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
19,

characterised in that,

the width and/or the length of the support surface (5) and,
if applicable, of the support element (9), are variable.
