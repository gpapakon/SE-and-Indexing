crosslinked epoxy resin are interspaced with a layer of a 
thermoplastic polymer, which thermoplastic polymer comprises a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fibre-reinforced composites
and more in particular to such composites comprising two or more
layers of a fibre-reinforced, crosslinked epoxy resin, wherein the
adjacent epoxy resin layers are interspaced with a layer of a
thermoplastic resin, to the preparation of said composites and to
their use.Reinforced composites or composite materials have many
excellent properties such as high specific strength, engineerability
and low energy content, but they also have a number of limitations.
As these fibre-reinforced composite materials are generally
characterised by a high stiffness, bending of such composites will
induce high shear stresses in planes parallel to the principle fibre
direction. When the composites are submitted to impact testing they
show an unacceptable degree of delamination. It is generally
understood that this problem is related to the insufficient ability
of the composite materials to dissipate the impact energy.It has been proposed to improve the performance of the fibre-reinforced
composites as described hereinbefore, including the
damage-tolerance of said composites, by reducing the crosslink
density of the polymer matrix or by incorporating therein an
elastomeric compound. However these methods do, in general, not
provide the desired results.Another known modification for said reinforced composites
comprises the replacement of the thermoset matrix by a thermoplastic
one. Although said method improves the strain resistance of the
polymer matrix, compression strength is simultaneously reduced to an
unacceptably low level, due to the generally lower stiffness of the
thermoplastic matrix.Yet another method for improving the overall performance of the
fibre-reinforced, crosslinked epoxy resin composites comprises the
insertion of a thermoplastic film, for example, made from Nylon-6, 
between the different layers of reinforced epoxy resin during the
preparation of said composites. However, with this method it has
been experienced that the performance is hampered by insufficient
adhesion between the thermoplastic interlayer and the thermoset
matrix.Hence it can be concluded that there still is a need to improve
the overall performance of fibre-reinforced, crosslinked epoxy resin
composites.The problem underlying the present invention is to develop a
fibre-reinforced, crosslinked epoxy resin based composite, which
does not suffer from one or more of the problems described
hereinbefore, i.e. a composite having an improved overall
performance.As a result of
