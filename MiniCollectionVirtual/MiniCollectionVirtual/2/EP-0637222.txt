<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method to monitor the balance performance of a user comprises two separate but similar foot-plates (11 and 12) each slightly larger than the foot of a user. Each foot-plate includes detectors (18, 19) to detect the load imparted to the foot-plate by a user, about two axes (33, 34) generally at right angles with one axis lying more or less along the length of the user's foot and the other axis transverse thereto. The outputs from the foot-plates are fed to a processing unit (10) which drives a display device (13), graphically to show to the user on a real-time basis the detected loads and so to allow a user to modify his balance performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for monitoring the
balance performance of a user suitable for use for example
in physiotherapy as well as in other medical circumstances,
in sports both to assist recovery from an injury and to
improve performance, and in other fields.It has been established that the posture and gait of a
person can often be improved by monitoring the load carried
by each foot, and then displaying essentially in real time
those loads to the person in such a way that he may himself
adjust the loads until they become substantially the same.
In effect, a closed-loop system is set up allowing a user
to observe and correct primarily his balance and perhaps
also his posture. It is found that if a person suffers for
example from disease of the joints or from post-injury
trauma, the loads carried by the two feet may differ
greatly, but by allowing a person to monitor those loads
himself in the manner described above, rapid improvements
in the condition from which the user is suffering may be
obtained.A balance performance monitor for humans is known, and
comprises a pair of foot-plates upon which a user may
stands with one foot on each foot-plate respectively, each
foot-plate having an indication of the general position
over which a user's foot should be placed and having means
to detect the load imparted thereto by the user, and means
to display the load imparted to each foot-plate. The user
can use such known apparatus to adjust his posture and in
this way attempt to make the loads imparted to the two
foot-plates substantially equal.One example of apparatus of the above kind is to be
found in DE-A-2723775 and GB-A-1528305. This employs two
single-axis foot plates and so can detect the total load
imparted by each foot, or if the patient turns through 90Â°,
the front-to-back load on each foot. Experience of using
such equipment shows that a mis-diagnosis of true balance 
performance is quite likely, and even the possibility of
assessing there is no clinical problem when in fact there
is a significant deficiency in balance performance.Following extended research into balance and posture,
it has now been determined that further and more rapid
improvements are possible if the user is supplied with even
more information concerning the loading on his two feet,
and specifically concerning the front-to-back loading and
the side-to-side loading, separately but simultaneously for
each foot. Thus, the present invention provides apparatus
to monitor the balance performance of a user of the kind
described
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus to monitor the balance performance
of a user, which apparatus comprises a pair of

foot-plates (11,12) upon which the user may stand
with one foot on each foot-plate respectively, each

foot-plate (11,12) having an indication of the
general position over which a user's foot should be

placed and having means to detect the load imparted
thereto by the user, and means to display the load

imparted to each foot-plate, characterised in that:

a) the load-detecting means (15,18,19)
associated with each foot-plate is arranged to

detect the load imparted to the respective foot-plate
(11,12) about a first axis lying generally

along the length of a user's foot correctly placed
with respect to the foot position indication and

simultaneously to detect the load imparted to the
foot-plate about a second axis generally at right

angles to the first axis; and
b) the display means (13)
displays in a graphical manner, for each foot-plate

(11,12) separately, the position of the detected
loads with respect to a representation of the

user's feet.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein each
foot-plate (11,12) is supported by a pair of spaced

resilient beams (15), provided with strain detectors
(18,19) which provide outputs depending upon the

loading on the foot-plate.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the
load-detecting means of each foot-plate (11,12)

comprises a plurality of load cells disposed beneath
the foot-plate, each load cell providing an 

electrical output dependent upon the load applied
thereto.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein each foot-plate (11,12) is provided with

load-detecting means (18,19) arranged to detect
loading substantially at the four corners of a

rectangle which encloses the area of the foot-plate
upon which a user should stand.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or Claim 3,
wherein each foot-plate (11,12) is provided with

load-detecting means (18,19) arranged to detect
loading at the points of a diamond, with two points

on the first axis and two on the second axis of the
foot-plate.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein the display means (13)

includes pictorial representations (25,26) of two
feet together with two series of indicators (27,28)

for each respectively, extending respectively along
and transverse to the representation, and which

indicators (27,28) are successively activated
dependent upon the outputs of the load-detecting

means.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, wherein there is
a further series of indicators arranged to represent

a comparison of the total load imparted by a user to
each of the two foot-plates.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 5,
wherein the graphical display is computer-generated

and is displayed on a visual display unit.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein there is additionally provided a

seat having load-detecting means arranged to permit
an assessment of the left-to-right balance and the 

front-to-rear balance of a person sitting on that
seat, the outputs from the seat additionally being

supplied to said display means for display thereon.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein the outputs from the load-detecting

means of the two foot-plates are supplied to
computer apparatus programmed to combine the outputs

from the load-detecting means in the appropriate
ways. 
A method of providing a user with a real-time
indication of his balance performance using

apparatus having a pair of foot-plates (11,12)
upon which the user may stand with one foot on

each foot-plate respectively, each foot-plate
having an indication of the general position over

which a user's foot should be placed and having

means to detect the load imparted thereto by the
user, and means to display the load imparted to

each foot-plate, which method is characterised by
simultaneously but separately detecting the front-to-back

loading and the side-to-side loading
imparted by each foot of a user on each foot-plate

(11,12) respectively, and processing the detected
loadings to drive a graphical display device

(13) illustrating to the user in
a graphical manner the position of the detected

loads with respect to a representation of the
user's feet.
