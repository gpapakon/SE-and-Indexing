<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to multiplex
wiring systems for use in motor vehicles and, more
particularly, to a method and apparatus for formatting and
transmitting data bits divided into subbits of unequal,
preferably progressively increasing duration in a multiplex
wiring system.Multiplex wiring systems have been used in motor
vehicles to provide communications over a reduced number of
wires for a wide range of accessory control and computer
communications applications. In such systems, a plurality
of communication nodes, each capable of serially
transmitting and receiving digital data, are coupled to a
data bus, such as a twisted wire pair. The nodes convert
signals received from local computers, sensors, transducers
or the like into a format acceptable for transmission on the
data bus. For example, a node may convert parallel data
from a local computer or sensor into serial data.
Conversely, serial data signals appearing on the data bus
are transformed by a node into a format usable by the node.The serial digital data generated by the nodes is
generally formatted to sequentially include a start-of-message
signal, an address for a particular receiving node,
message data for performing an operation or conveying
information regarding the current status of the node, and an
end-of-message signal. Each communication node detects the
start-of-message signal for actuating the appropriate
receiving circuitry. However, only the designated receiving
node recognises its own address and then acts upon the
instruction data following its address. An example of such
a multiplex wiring system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,651,454 issued to Venema et al.Various data string formats have been used in the past
to transfer information between communication modules.
Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,792,950 issued to Volk
et al discloses a data signal which uses a pulse width 
modulated (PWM) format. In this PWM format, each data bit
is divided into three subbits of equal duration. For
example, a bit of twenty four microseconds is comprised of
three eight microsecond subbits. A logic zero (0) data bit
is defined by two initial subbits at a high voltage level
followed by one subbit at a low voltage level. Conversely,
a logic one (1) data bit is comprised of one high voltage
level subbit followed by two low voltage level subbits.Using serial data transmission and known data string
formats as opposed to parallel transmission reduces the
number of wires needed for the data bus and reduces the
number of line
