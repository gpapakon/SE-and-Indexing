<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container (10), which can be mounted on a housing of an electrical appliance, especially of a strip light, for at least one battery (16) to supply electrical power to the appliance. The container (10) comprises a container lower part (11) and a container upper part (12), which are connected to one another in a sealed manner, as well as connecting elements (23, 24) which can be connected to corresponding connecting elements (63) on the appliance during fastening. On its side wall, the container (10) has depressions (23, 24) which are like blind holes and are open towards the outside, and in which connecting elements (28) are located. A covering plate (20) is provided in the region of the depressions (23, 24) and can be displaced against the force of a spring arrangement (53), covering the depressions (23, 24) in a first position, and exposing them in a second position.

Receiving container capable of being fastened to a 
housing of an electric device, especially a Langfeld lamp, 

for at least one battery for supplying the power of the 
device, having a container lower part and a container upper 

part which are connected to one another in sealed manner and 
having connection elements which on fastening can be 

connected to corresponding connection elements of the device, 

characterised in that
 on a side wall the container (10) has 
cavities (23, 24) like blind-end bores open towards the 

outside, in which the connection elements (28) are located 
and that in the region of the cavities (23, 24) a cover plate 

(20) is provided which is displaceable against the force of 
a spring arrangement (53), wherein in a first position it 

covers the cavities (23, 24) and in a second position frees 
them. 
Receiving container according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that provided on the device is a limit stop 

against which the cover plate (20) strikes during the 
fastening of the battery container (10) on the device and 

which displaces the cover plate (20) into the second 

position. 
Receiving container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that formed vertically on the cover 

plate (20) and at a distance from one another are two 
projections (39, 40) or two pairs of projections (39, 40) 

which engage in guide recesses (37, 38) on the container (10) 
and by this means guide the cover plate (20) during 

displacement. 
Receiving container according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterised in that between the projections or 
pairs of projections (39, 40) the spring arrangement (53) is 

provided, one end of which fits against a wall (55) on the 
cover plate and the other end of which fits against a wall 

(54) on the container. 
Receiving container according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the spring is a coiled compression 

spring. 
Receiving container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cover plate (20) has at 

least one catch (21, 22) on the side opposite the projections 
(39, 40). 
Receiving container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the connection elements on the 

battery container (10) are plug pins (28) or socket elements 
which can be plugged into socket elements (63) or plug pins 

on the device. 
Receiving container according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the socket elements (63) are surrounded 

by a sleeve (62) made of insulating material projecting over 
the latter in such a way that before bringing the plug pins 

(34) into contact with the socket elements (63) a pressure 
resistant air gap in accordance with the explosion and 

firedamp regulations is formed between the sleeve and the 
plug pin. 
Receiving container according to Claim 7, in which the 
connection elements are plug pins, characterised in that each 

of the plug pins (34) engaging through the bottom of the 
cavities is fixed at the bottom of the cavity (23, 24) on the  

 
inside of the container by means of a ridge (29) and on the 

outside of the container or bottom side of the cavity by 
means of a spring element (31). 
Receiving container according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that the spring element (31) is constructed 

as an approximately plate-like ring the inner rim of which 
has spring fingers (32) which are snapped into a circular 

groove (30) on the plug pin (28) and act upon the plug pin 
towards the outside and by this means push the ridge (29) 

against a recess (26) on the inside of the container. 
Receiving container according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that in the interior of the container on 

each plug pin (28) a cable lug (48, 50) is fastened, to which 
a connecting conductor to at least one battery is connected. 
Receiving container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at its free end the plug pin 

(28) has a region (35) of reduced diameter which can be 
fitted into the socket element (63).
