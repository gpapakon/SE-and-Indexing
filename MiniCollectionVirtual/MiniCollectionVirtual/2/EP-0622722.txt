<ABSTRACT>
A system for generating new documents (20) from originals (4) containing text
and/or images (22,28) employing e.g. a camera-projector system (6,8) focussed on a work

surface (2), in conjunction with a copier or printer. In use, the camera 6 captures various manual
operations carried out by the user, e.g. by pointing with fingers and tapping on the surface on

the text or images (22,28) in an original paper document (4) on the surface (2) and representing
manipulations of the text or images (22,28). Feedback to the user is provided by projection of

an image (21,24) onto the surface or onto the original, or using some other visual display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interactive image reproduction machines, and more
particularly reproduction machines for performing various operations on text or images during
the creation of a new document.it is common for office workers and others who work with documents on a regular
basis to have effectively two desksâ€•the "electronic desktop" provided by a workstation or
personal computer by means of a graphical interface, and the physical desk on which paper
documents are received and processed.The electronic desktop, which has become more and more like the physical one, can
perform numerous useful operations on documents stored in electronic form; but in dealing
with tangible documents such devices have limitations. A paper document must either be
converted into electronic form before the operations are performed on it in the electronic
environment, or copying operations are carried out on the tangible document using an
electrophotographic copier (such as a photocopier with an editing function) or a combined
scanning and printing device, the available functions of which are restricted in nature.Wellner P.: "The DigitalDesk Calculator: Tangible Manipulation on a Desk Top Display",

33, XP000315063, Association for Computing Machinery describes a digital desk with a
computer-controlled camera and projector above it. The camera sees where the user is
pointing and it reads portions of documents that are placed on the desk. The projector
displays feedback and electronic objects onto the desk surface. In more detail, the video
camera is mounted above the digital desk pointing down at the work surface. The camera's
output is fed through a computer and image processing system. The computer and image
processing system is further connected with a computer-driven projector that is also mounted
above the desk, allowing to superimpose electronic objects onto paper documents on the
users work surface. The digital desk permits to project feedback onto the desk instead of on
a separate screen. The key features of this digital desk are: using a camera to allow pointing
with the fingers, reading paper documents on the desk, and projecting images onto the desk. 
Further to fingers, other things that can be used on the digital desk are described: an
ordinary eraser may be made to erase electronic documents in addition to physical
documents, a

<CLAIMS>
A document creation system, comprising:

a work surface (2);
means (8) for displaying images on the work surface, said images comprising at least
one blank image (20) representing a document in electronic form to be created;
a camera (6), focussed on the work surface, for generating video signals representing
in electronic form image information (4, 22) present within the field of view of the camera;
processing means (10) for recognizing one or more manual operations relating to the
image information which are executed by a user (18) within the field of view of the

camera, and for performing electronic operations, corresponding to said manual operations,
on the electronic form of the document to be created to produce a modified

electronic form representing a created document;
the displaying means (8) being adapted to display, under the control of the processing
means (10), simultaneously with or subsequent to said electronic operations, images

defined by said manual operations; and
wherein said images defined by said manual operations include an image of the created
document.
The document creation system according to claim 1, wherein the modified electronic
form includes an electronic version of the newly created document. 
The document creation system according to claim 1 or 2, further including means for
printing a document corresponding to at least part of said modified electronic form.
The document creation system according to one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein

the image information (4, 22) comprises image information present in at least a second
document within the field of view of the camera (6), and

the one or more manual operations comprise one or more manual operation(s) representing
the transfer of image information (22) from the second document to the document

to be created.
A method of creating documents, comprising:

providing a work surface (2), means (8) for displaying images on the work surface,
said images comprising at least one blank image (20) representing a document in

electronic form to be created, and a camera (6) focussed on the work surface, said
camera generating video signals representing in electronic form image information (4,

22) present within the field of view of the camera;
recognizing one or more manual operations relating to the image information which
are executed by a user (18) within the field of view of the camera;
performing electronic operations, corresponding to said manual operations, on the
electronic form of the document to be created to produce a modified electronic form

representing a created document;
displaying, simultaneously with or subsequent to the act of performing electronic operations,
images defined by said manual operations; and
wherein said images defined by said manual operations include an image of the created
document.
The method according to claim 5, wherein the modified electronic form includes an
electronic version of a newly created document. 
The method according to claim 5 or 6, further comprising:

supplying to a printing device said modified electronic form; and
printing out said created document.
The method according to one of the claims 5 to 7, wherein said manual operations
include selecting a portion of text or image information in a document (4) located

within the field of view of the camera.
A computer program comprising computer-executable instructions for performing all
machine-executable steps of any of the method claims 5 to 8 when run on a suitable

programmable apparatus for creating documents.
