<ABSTRACT>
A body with a coating comprising one or more refractory 
layers of which at least one layer is a layer of α-Al₂O₃ textured 

in the (110) direction is disclosed. Said alumina layer 
which is essentially free of cooling cracks, comprises 

platelike grains with a length of 2-8 µm and a length/width-ratio 
of 1 - 10, preferably 3 - 7. The coated tools according to 

the present invention show improved tool lives compared to 
prior art tools when used for machining steel or cast iron material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alumina coated cutting
tool for chipforming machining.Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of alumina on cutting
tools has been an industrial practice for more than 15 years.
The wear properties of Al2O3 as well as of other refractory materials
have been discussed extensively in the literature.The CVD-technique has also been used to produce coatings of
other metal oxides, carbides and nitrides, the metal being selected
from transition metals of the IVB, VB and VIB groups of
the Periodic Table. Many of these compounds have found practical
applications as wear resistant or protective coatings, but
few have received as much attention as TiC, TiN and Al2O3.Cemented carbide cutting tools coated with various types
Al2O3-coatings, e.g., pure κ-Al2O3, mixtures of κ-and α-Al2O3
and very coarse-grained α-Al2O3 have been commercially available
for many years. Al2O3 crystallizes in several different
phases: α, κ, γ, β,  etc. The two most frequently occurring
phases in CVD of wear resistant Al2O3-coatings are the thermodynamically
stable, hexagonal α-phase and the metastable κ-phase.
Generally, the κ-phase is fine-grained with a grain size
in the range 0.5-2.0 µm and often exhibits a columnar coating
morphology. Furthermore, κ-Al2O3 coatings are free from crystallographic
defects and free from micropores or voids.The α-Al2O3 grains are usually coarser with a grain size of
1-6 µm depending upon the deposition conditions. Porosity and
crystallographic defects are in this case more common.Often both α- and κ-phase are present in a CVD alumina coating
deposited onto a cutting tool. In commercial cutting
tools, Al2O3 is always applied on TiC coated carbide or ceramic
substrates (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3,837,896, now Reissue U.S.
Pat. No. 29,420) and therefore the interfacial chemical reactions
between the TiC-surface and the alumina coating are of
particular importance. In this context the TiC layer should
also be understood to include layers having the formula
TiCxNyOz in which the carbon in TiC is completely or partly
substituted by oxygen and/or nitrogen. The practice of coating cemented carbide cutting tools with
oxides to further increase their wear resistance is in itself
well known as is evidenced in e.g. U.S. Pat. Reissue No. 29,420
and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,168, 4,018,631, 4,490,191 and
4,463,033. These patents disclose oxide coated bodies and how
different pretreatments e.g. of TiC-coated cemented carbide,
enhance the adherence of the subsequently deposited oxide
layer. Alumina
