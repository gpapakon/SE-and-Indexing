<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multilayer polypropylene film which comprises a core layer K, an interlayer Z and a top layer D in accordance with the structure KZD. The base layer contains polypropylene or a polypropylene mixture and filler. The interlayer contains polypropylene or a polypropylene mixture and pigment. The top layer is heat-sealable and contains a combination of inorganic and/or organic particles and tertiary aliphatic amine of the formula I.

filler, the polypropylene containing at least 90% by weight propylene units and having a
melting point of at least 140°C and at least one intermediate layer disposed thereon and

at least one sealable top layer disposed on the intermediate layer and which contains co- and/or
terpolymers consisting of α-olefins with 2 to 10 carbon atoms or sealable

homopolymers, characterised in that

a) the top layer contains 2 to 8% by weight, in relation to the weight of the top layer,
