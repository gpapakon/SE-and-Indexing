<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an audio signal 
processing apparatus and more particularly to an apparatus 

and method for processing an audio signal by surround 
modes in which a surround-sound of an original sound in 

accordance with surround modes can be reproduced by 
carrying surround code information to the audio signal 

being transmitted and by detecting the surround code 
information upon receipt of the audio signal. An 

apparatus for processing an audio signal having a 
transmitting device (26, 46) which transmits the audio 

signal and a receiving device (30, 50) which surround-processes 
the audio signal and outputs the surround-processed 

audio signal, the transmitting device (26, 46) 
comprising a device (22, 42) for generating a surround 

discriminating signal indicating a surround mode 
appropriate to the audio signal and a mixer (24, 44) for 

mixing the surround discriminating signal with the audio 
signal, and the receiving device (22, 42) comprising a 

separator (32, 34, 52, 54) for separating the surround 
discriminating signal from the audio signal, a surround 

mode detector (36, 56) for detecting the surround mode 
from the surround discriminating signal separated by the 

separator (32, 34, 52, 54), and a surround processor (38, 
58, 60) for surround-processing the audio signal in 

response to the detection result of the surround mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an audio signal processing
apparatus and more particularly to an apparatus and method
for processing an audio signal by surround modes in which a
surround-sound of an original sound in accordance with
surround modes can be reproduced by carrying surround code
information to the audio signal being transmitted and by
detecting the surround code information upon receipt of the
audio signal.In general, audio sets having a surround circuit capable of
providing the surround-sound of a current sound, ie the
audio-impression of the sound field where an original sound
is produced, to a listener are installed have been now
popularised. Unlike stereo, the surround-sound is capable
of reproducing the audio-impression of a sound field by
generating an inherent reflected sound responsive to an
audio signal.Figure 1 shows an audio apparatus in which the surround
circuit is installed, which is disclosed in Korean patent
application 92-7759 filed by the applicant of the present
application. A surround unit 14 has a plurality of
surround circuits 14a, 14b and 14c which delay the audio
signal applied from left and right audio input terminals L
and R to represent a surround-sound effect different from
each other. A switch 16 connects one of the surround
circuits 14a, 14b and 14C to left and right surround
exclusive speakers SSP1 and SSP2. A controller 18, for
example, a micro computer, serves to control the switch 16.
A sound adjustor 10 adjusts a base, balance, treble and
volume of the audio signal and then outputs the adjusted
audio signal through speakers SP1 and SP2. An amplifier 12
is connected to an output terminal of the sound adjustor 10 
and amplifies the audio signal supplied to the speakers SP1
and SP2.The audio apparatus shown in Figure 1 has an advantage of
providing a variable surround-sound effect to a user by
installing therein a plurality of surround circuits each of
which generate a surround-sound effect different from the
others.However, there is much inconvenience in using the audio
apparatus shown in Figure 1, since the surround circuits
which generate a surround-sound effect corresponding to the
surround-sound characteristic of an original sound in a
hall, concert, sportsground, theater, etc need to be
individually selected by a user in accordance with the
surround-sound characteristic.Moreover, when the surround-sound characteristic of the
original sound is not matched with the characteristic of
the surround circuit selected by the user, the surround-sound
effect to
