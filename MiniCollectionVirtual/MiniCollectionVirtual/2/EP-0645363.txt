<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing adipic acid from cyclohexene oxide in an industrially advantageous manner, which 
comprises hydrating cyclohexene oxide into a mixture of 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane 

with an oligomer represented by 
formula (1), and oxidizing a mixture comprising the oligomer and/or 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane 

and/or cyclohexene 
oxide in an aqueous nitric acid solution, wherein n represents a number ranging from 1 to 5.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing
adipic acid from cyclohexene oxide.Dutch Patent Application No. 6601148 discloses a
process for preparing adipic acid by oxidizing
1,2-dioxycyclohexane compound in a nitric acid aqueous
solution containing a water-soluble vanadium salt. It
discloses the advantage of the process, over the currently
world-wide spread process of oxidizing cyclohexanol and/or
cyclohexanone with nitric acid, in that the proportion of
nitric acid consumed in the form of nitrogen and nitrous
oxide is reduced. However, in Example 1 in which cyclohexene
oxide is used as a starting material and nitric acid having a
concentration of 70% is used as the oxidizing agent, the
yield of adipic acid attained is 94% and 0.16 mol of nitric
acid is consumed in the form of nitrous oxide and nitrogen
per mol of the organic starting material. In Example 4 in
which 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane is used as a starting
material, although nitric acid having a concentration as high
as 70% is used, the yield of adipic acid is 94%, and 0.16 mol
of nitric acid is consumed in the form of nitrous oxide and
nitrogen per mol of the organic starting material. That is,
the above technique shows some improvement but is still unsatisfactory While 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane can be obtained
through various processes, hydration of cyclohexene oxide
derived from cyclohexene is one of the industrially
economical processes. A method of hydration of an epoxy
compound is described, e.g., in Morison Boyd Yuki Kagaku
Dai-4-han (Morison Boyd Organic Chemistry 4th edition),
translated by Nakanishi et al., pp. 720-728, Tokyo Kagaku
Dojin. The inventors of the present invention further
examined the hydration reaction of cyclohexene oxide and, as
a result, found that the reaction is accompanied by the
formation of by-products consisting mainly of oligomers of
cyclohexene oxide represented by formula (I):

wherein n represents a number of from 1 to 5, and that water
for hydration must be used in large excess over a theoretical
amount in order to minimize the by-production of oligomers
(I).A first object of the present invention is to
eliminate the above-mentioned disadvantages associated with
Dutch Patent Application No. 6601148 and to establish an
industrially valuable process for preparing adipic acid in an 
increased yield while suppressing formation of nitrous oxide and nitrogen.The aforesaid Dutch patent application and other proposals hitherto made
regarding preparation of adipic acid from cyclohexanol and/or cyclohexanone by
ox
