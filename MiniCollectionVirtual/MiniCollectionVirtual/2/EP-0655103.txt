<ABSTRACT>
A system and method is provided whereby exhaust gases from a cold started internal combustion engine (41) are rapidly brought to catalytic combustion conditions. Specifically, a closed system of a low pressure metal hydride heat exhanger (44) and a high pressure metal hydride heat exchanger (48) is provided which, upon engine ignition, effectuates hydrogen flow from the high pressure alloy exchanger (48) with rapid heating of the low pressure alloy in the low pressure metal hydride heat exchanger (44) due to hydrogen occlusion, and with the further provision that the heated low pressure hydride alloy exchanger (44) is in heat exchange relationship with the cold started engine exhaust gases or the vehicle catalytic converter (23) and provides heat necessary for initiation of catalytic combustion of pollutants in the exhaust gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EXHAUST GAS PREHEATING SYSTEM Background of the Invention Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the rapid preheating of internal combustion engine exhaust gases by means of a metal hydride heating system. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides both rapid preheating of engine exhaust gases and rapid cooling or air conditioning of a motor vehicle interior. Description of the Prior ArtCurrently, many internal combustion engines in automobiles are equipped with a catalytic converter for purifying the engine exhaust gas. Almost every catalyst now used for this purpose displays its ability to the extent of practical satisfaction only when it is maintained at a sufficiently high temperature. While the engine is operating under normal conditions, the temperature of the exhaust gas is high enough to allow the catalyst in the catalytic converter to work satisfactorily efficiently. However, the catalyst cannot work satisfactorily when the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low as is usual for some time immediately after cold-starting of the engine. 

Accordingly, it becomes necessary to provide the catalytic converter or the engine with a warm-up means for promoting warm-up of the catalyst in the catalytic converter to render the catalyst effective as soon as possible after starting of the engine.As a practical example of hitherto proposed warm-up means for automotive catalytic converters, there is a system which is so constructed as to promote warm-up of the catalyst during idling of the engine immediately after cold-starting by slightly increasing the opening degree of the throttle valve with the intention of supplying an increased quantity of exhaust gas to the catalytic converter and at the same time slightly retarding the ignition timing in order to raise the temperature of the exhaust gas. Usually, a throttle opening device and an ignition timing retarding device in this system are both of a vacuum-operated type having a flexible diaphragm with a vacuum chamber defined on one side of the diaphragm, and these two devices are individually connected to the intake passage at a section downstream of the throttle valve such that vacuum created in the intake manifold can simultaneously be applied to the two devices. An electromagnetic valve is used to admit air into the vacuum passages for these two devices during normal operation of the engine and block the admission of air while the engine is idling and the temperature of the engine or the engine cooling
