The burner assembly (10) includes a funnel (69) having an inlet end (140), an outlet end (138), and an air and fuel mixing region (24) therebetween. The funnel (69) includes a conical side wall (136) converging from the inlet end (140) toward the outlet end (138). The burner assembly (10) contains a nozzle (80) for supplying a gaseous fuel (14) into mixing region (24) and a burner housing (26) around funnel (69) for introducing combustion air (28) into the mixing region (24) through the inlet end (140) of the funnel (69). An air-mixing plate (90) is mounted in the inlet end (140) of the funnel (69) and arranged to support the nozzle (80) in the burner housing (26). The air-mixing plate (90) contains a plurality of air supply apertures (122, 124, 126 and 128) to permit air in the burner housing (26) to flow into the mixing region (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to burner 
assemblies and particularly to high capacity tube-fired 
burners. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to an immersion tube burner including a 
combustion chamber for burning a combustible air and fuel 
mixture and an immersion tube heat exchanger. Immersion tube burners are used in a variety of 
industrial processes to heat solution tanks containing 
liquid. It is often necessary to heat liquids such as 
water for parts cleaning or chemical baths for parts 
treating or plating. It is known to mount an immersion 
tube burner to a liquid-containing solution tank. The 
burner is arranged so that it fires into one end of a 
long pipe or serpentine tube which passes through liquid 
in the solution tank. An outlet end of the tube is 
connected to an exhaust stack. Typically, tube burners will either use 
refractory in the combustion chamber or the burner will 
attach to the wall of the tank so that the combustion 
chamber is mounted inside the tank. Refractory 
represents a large initial acquisition expense as well as 
continuing operating costs due to maintenance and repair. 
Mounting the combustion chamber in the tank allows the 
liquid in the tank to provide the cooling necessary to 
keep the combustion chamber from melting. However, these 
combustion chambers can range from 8-20 inches (20.3 - 
50.8 cm) in diameter and from 25-52 inches (63.5 - 
132.1 cm) in length. Obviously, such chambers represent 
a large volume of space consumed in the tank. Eliminating the combustion chamber from the 
tank would allow for more passes of a smaller diameter 
tube through the liquid, thereby increasing the overall  
 
thermal efficiency of the apparatus. It also allows the 
use of a smaller tank with associated floor space 
savings. Doing away with the refractory would decrease 
initial acquisition expense, save weight, and eliminate 
maintenance and repair associated with the refractory. In the past, in order to fire enough gas to 
achieve the necessary temperatures, high pressure fans 
and relatively large diameter tubes were used. The high 
pressure fans, because of the size of the fan and 
associated ducting, represent another major cost factor 
in terms of acquisition. The larger fans require larger 
horsepower motors to drive them, and therefore have 
higher operating expenses. The large diameter tubes generally ranged 
between six inches (15.2 cm) and twelve inches 
(30.5 cm)in diameter. Large diameter tubes can increase 
costs by as much as a factor of four
