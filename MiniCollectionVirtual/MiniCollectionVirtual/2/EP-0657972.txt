<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal applicator (10) is 
disclosed for crimping terminals (24) onto wires, with the 

terminals being secured to a tape (26) in a side-by-side 
relationship. An applicator ram (14) is drivable in a 

first path (A) through a working stroke towards, and a 
return stroke away from, a crimping anvil (22). A crimping 

die (18, 20) on the applicator ram cooperates with the 
anvil to crimp a portion of a terminal onto a wire during 

each working stroke of the ram. A track (32) guides the 
tape in a second path (B) which intersects the first path 

of the ram. A tape feeding system (44) includes a shuttle 
member (70) adapted for linear reciprocal movement 

alongside the second path of the tape in an advancing 
stroke towards, and a return stroke away from, the crimping 

anvil. The shuttle member has at least one tooth (76) for 
engaging indexing apertures (30) in the tape (26) and 

incrementally advancing the tape on the advancing stroke of 
the shuttle member. Fixed stop teeth (80, 82) engage the 

indexing apertures (30) of the tape (26) to prevent the 
tape from moving back away from the crimping anvil on the 

return stroke of the shuttle member. The stroke of the 
shuttle member is adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical terminal applicators and, particularly, to an
improved feeding mechanism for tapes with terminals secured
thereto in a side-by-side relationship.It is now commonly known in the art of crimped
electrical terminals to provide many types of crimpable
terminals on a continuous tape of thin material such as
plastic. The terminals are suitably secured to the tape in
a manner such that they can be fed to a crimping apparatus,
and the leading terminal of the tape is crimped onto a wire
after which it is removed from the tape. The present
invention relates to an improved applicator for crimping
electrical terminals on such a tape and particularly to an
improved tape feeding means.
Reference is made to US-A-4 019 362 and to GB-A-2 233 263.A known type of electrical terminal applicator
includes an applicator ram drivable by a press ram through
a working stroke towards, and a return stroke away from, a
crimping anvil. The applicator ram has a first crimping
die for cooperation with the anvil to crimp a first portion
of an electrical terminal onto an exposed end of a
conductive core of an insulated electrical wire during each
working stroke of the applicator ram. The applicator ram
has a second crimping die for cooperation with the anvil to
crimp a second portion of the terminal onto the insulation
of the electrical wire during each working stroke of the
applicator ram. The second crimping die is adjustable 
axially of the applicator ram. Plate means are mounted for
angular adjustment about an axis on, and extending
lengthwise of, the applicator ram. The plate means
selectively interpose first projections between the press
ram and the applicator ram to adjust the shut height of the
first and second dies, and selectively interpose second
projections between the applicator ram and the second
crimping die to independently adjust the shut height of the
second die.In this known terminal applicator, as well as
other similar tape-feeding applicators, the applicator ram
can be considered as being drivable in a first path through
its working stroke, and the terminal tape is fed in a
second path which intersects the first path of the
applicator ram. Tape feeding means are provided for
indexing the tape along the second path to sequentially
advance a leading uncrimped terminal on the tape in
response to reciprocation of the ram. One type of feeding
means includes an oscillating feed link or arm, and the
feeding link includes a finger for sequentially advancing
the tape

<CLAIMS>
An electrical terminal applicator (10) for crimping
terminals (24) onto wires, with the terminals being

secured to a tape (26) in a side-by-side relationship,
an applicator housing (12a) having a passage

therethrough,

an applicator ram (14) positioned in said passage and
drivable therein in a first linear vertical path (A)

through a working stroke towards, and a return stroke
away from, a crimping anvil (22),
a crimping die (18, 20) mounted on a lower portion of
the applicator ram (14) for cooperation with the anvil

(22) to crimp a portion of a terminal onto a wire during
each working stroke of the ram,
an adaptor head (16) on an upper portion of the
applicator ram (14) for engagement with a press ram,

track means (32) for guiding the tape (26) in a tape
path (B) which intersects the ram path (A),
feeding means (44) for indexing the tape (26) along the
tape path (B) to sequentially advance a leading

uncrimped terminal on the tape in response to
reciprocation of the ram,

characterized in that said tape feeding means (44)
