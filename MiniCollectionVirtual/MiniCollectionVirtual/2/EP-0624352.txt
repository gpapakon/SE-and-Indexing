<ABSTRACT>
A device for treating and preventing injuries and contractures 
of the elbow joint, particularly supination-pronation 

contractures and 
proximal radial head fractures. The device includes 

bracing sections (16,26) 
for fixing the device to the radius (14) and the ulna (12), and 

for permitting 
movement of the attached radius (14) continually along a 

path which is 
adapted and adjusted to be aligned with the kinematic 

axis of the 
proximal radial- joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the treatment of 
injuries and contractures of the elbow joint, particularly supination-pronation 
contracture and proximal radial head fractures, and more 
particularly to a device to prevent or correct supination-pronation 
contractures of the radial-ulna joint. Contractures, a tendency for muscles, tendons or scar tissue to 
shorten in skeletal joints, are common after trauma and represent a 
major challenge in the care of such injuries. Routine and 
occupational tasks can be severely hindered by flexion-extension 
contractures of the humeral-ulna joint as well as supination-pronation 
contractures of the proximal radial-ulna joint which controls rotational 
motion of the radius about the axis of the ulna. Current approaches to the treatment of elbow trauma have 
more aggressively sought to prevent contracture and stiffness 
through movement. Methods of rigid internal fixation with sufficient 
stability to allow motion within days after injury rather than closed 
treatment and immobilisation in a cast have been developed. In the 
treatment of dislocations, protected early motion is now begun as 
soon as the patient is comfortably able to do so. However, the currently available techniques for the prevention 
of contracture are not uniformly successful. Early active motion 
alone can reduce the severity of contracture, but requires the 
patient's own strength, compliance and constant effort. Passive 
stretching by a therapist can be done on a very limited basis and it is 
applied slowly, but such therapy risks the formation of heterotopic 
bone and myositis ossifications. Dynamic splints may be used, but 
these require pressure on the sometimes sensitive or injured soft 
tissues of the arm and forearm and may not be possible, i.e. ,burn 
injury or may reduce patient compliance. Additionally, fractures of the proximal radius that require 
distraction have been treated in the past with simple pin fixation 
holding the ulna fixed to the radius. While fixed to the ulna, 
contracture and loss of motion occur.  
 Recently, a device was developed which permits aligned 
flexion and extension of the elbow during fixation to treat or prevent 
flexion-extension contracture at this joint, (US Patent No. 
5,102,411). However, no known device is available to prevent or 
correct supination-pronation contracture at the elbow joint. US 2,391,537, 
over which the two-part form of claim 1 is delimited, 
describes an ambulatory rotating reduction and 
fixation splint which

<CLAIMS>
A device for the treatment of supination-pronation contracture 
at a patient's radial-ulna joint comprising: 


first (26) and second (16) bracing sections; 
rigid connecting means (32) for rigidly connecting the first 
and second bracing sections to each other; 
first connecting means (28) for connecting the first bracing 
section to the radius; 
second connecting means (18) for connecting the second 
bracing section to the ulna; and 
movement means (36) operatively connected to the first 
connecting means for moving the first connecting means and 

consequently the radius relative to the ulna, characterised in that 
the first connecting means are connected to the first bracing means 

through adjustment means permitting multiple degrees of 
movement, and thereby providing for continued adaption of the device 

during pronation and supination motions in compensation for the 
conical path taken by the radius in its rotation about the ulna. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the movement means includes 
a gear means (42, 44) for mating with said first bracing section (26) 

and for moving the movement means (36) and consequently the 
connected radius (14) relative to the first bracing section (26) and 

consequently about the ulna (12) in supination and pronation in 
response to external force applied to the gear means.  

 
The device of claim 2 wherein said gear means (42, 44) 
further comprises a selective engagement means (42, 47) for 

selectively engaging said gear (42) with said first bracing section 
(26) such that force is transferred between the gear and the first 

bracing section to restrict free motion of the skeletal elements and 
permit controlled movement in supination and pronation and for 

selectively disengaging the gear and the first bracing section to 
allow the skeletal elements to move freely. 
The device of any preceding claim wherein said first bracing 
section (26) includes a threaded pin (28) adapted to engage bone. 
The device of claim 4 further including an adjustment rod (46) 
connecting the pin (28) with the first bracing section (26), the rod 

including a sleeve (50) for slidably engaging the pin. 
The device of claim 5 further including means (50, 52) for 
connecting the adjustment rod to the first bracing section, said 

means allowing the rod to simultaneously move axially and 
rotationally relative to the first bracing section. 
The device of claim 6 further including a spring means (48) 
for biasing the rod away from the pin. 
The device of claim 5 wherein said sleeve (50) includes an 
opening (52) having a semiconical relief area permitting pivotal 

movement of the pin within the sleeve. 
The device of any preceding claim further comprising: 

distraction means (32) for adjusting the distance between the 
first (26) and second (16) bracing sections thereby causing 

distraction of the radius. 
The device of claim 1 wherein 
the first bracing section (26) is a distal bracing sections and the second 

bracing section (16) is a proximal bracing section. 
The device of claim 10 further comprising: 

distraction means (32) for adjusting the distance between the 
proximal and distal bracing sections thereby causing distraction of 

the radius. 
The device of claim 10 or 11 further comprising: 

dynamic elbow hinge (2) operatively connected to the 
proximal bracing section (16).
