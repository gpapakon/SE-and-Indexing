<ABSTRACT>
A composition containing an emulsified dispersion 
prepared by dispersing a color developer dissolved in 

an organic solvent slightly soluble or insoluble in 
water and microcapsules containing a colorless or light 

colored electron donating dye precursor (core material), 
is coated onto a support (1) and dried, the refractive 

index of the core material and that of the oil phase 
of the color developer dispersion being selected in 

the range of 0.97 to 1.03. By providing a transparent 
heat sensitive layer (3) obtained by the above method 

on a printed support, printed matter (2) can be seen 
through the heat sensitive layer (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
heat-sensitive recording material having 
excellent transparency and being convenient for a special 
use. A heat-sensitive recording method, described, for example, in GB-A-2 158 958, has many advantages 
in that (1) no particular developing step is 
required, (2) if paper is used as a support, the recording 
material can have a quality akin to that of plain paper, 
(3) handling of the recording material used is easy, 
(4) the images recorded have high color density, (5) 
this method can be effected using a simple and cheap 
apparatus and (6) no noise is caused during recording. 
Therefore, heat-sensitive recording materials have recently 
enjoyed a markedly increasing demand, particularly for 
use with a facsimile or printer, and have come to be 
used for many purposes such as a pass, a label or a 
score card. Moreover, it has been desired to devise 
transparent heat-sensitive recording materials which 
enable direct recording with a thermal head in order 
to adapt them for multicolor development, or to make 
them usable for an overhead projector (hereinafter abbreviated 
as OHP). The possibility of providing such transparent 
heat-sensitive recording materials depends on the possibility 
of providing a transparent heat-sensitive layer, 
and it is easily foreseen that the demand for heat-sensitive 
recording material will be increased if said 
transparent heat-sensitive recording material is effectively 
provided.  
 For example, in the case where a heat-sensitive 
recording material is used for the afore-mentioned label, 
a heat-sensitive layer is usually coated on a support, 
then the required format such as a ruled line, a trade 
name or quantity, is thermally printed on the heat 
sensitive layer. In this case, however, a stain which 
is caused by unexpected coloring occurs when an organic 
solvent etc. is adsorbed on the heat-sensitive layer. 
Therefore, a protective layer comprised of a material 
which is not damaged by the organic solvent should be 
provided on the heat-sensitive layer to prevent the 
above mentioned staining. Moreover, on these labels 
water such as rain is often adsorbed so that water-soluble 
printing ink cannot then be used. Therefore, a special 
ink which contains selected organic solvents should 
be employed, but in this case, these organic solvents 
are often harmful to health, manufacturing costs become 
higher, and moreover a blocking phenomenon is apt to 
occur in the manufacturing process since a long time 
is
