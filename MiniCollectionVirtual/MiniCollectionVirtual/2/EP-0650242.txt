<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing water-submersible electromechanical devices and 
a device obtained through said method. The international standards establishing the electric 
insulation requirements for electromechanical devices 
intended to operate submersed in water (such as acquarium 
pumps) dictate that insulation class II devices must have a 
double insulation between electrical live parts and the 
environment: i.e. there must be two separate insulation 
layers physically separated and determining a structural 
discontinuity between themselves, in order to prevent the 
propagation of the possible failure of one insulation to the 
other. Currently, insulation class II electromechanical devices 
are enclosed in a casing made of a hard plastic material 
which makes up both the outer insulation layer and the walls 
of the mould for casting the resin constituting the inner 
insulation. Since the casing must be open on one side in order to 
allow the insertion of the electric device, the double 
insulation on this side is obtained, after casting the resin, 
by means of a cover welded along the edge of the casing, 
preferably by ultrasonic welding.  A drawback of this known solution consists in the 
difficulty of making a good welding because of the presence 
of the power supply cable and its lock. Another drawback consists in that the presence of the 
supply cable requires the necessity of inserting a rubber 
plug between the cable and the cover to assure tightness 
between said parts: the result of this operation is uncertain 
and represents an additional cost. Another drawback of the ultrasonic welding consists in 
that it causes the acoustic pollution of the working 
environment, so that the operators must wear protecting 
headphones. Another drawback consists in that the resin cast inside 
the casing must have a mineral filling in order to display 
effective heat dissipation, but the mineral filling limits 
mechanical and physical characteristics of the insulation 
layer. Yet another drawback consists in that the welding 
between casing and cover requires that both be designed for 
this purpose: so it is difficult to perform welding on 
devices already designed. JP-A-58163241 discloses a mechanically flexible casing 
for an electric device. The casing is constitued by a glass-fiber  
 
fabric impregnated with resin and as such it cannot be 
applied in position difficult to reach nor it can penetrate 
small interstices. The aim of the invention is to overcope the drawbacks
