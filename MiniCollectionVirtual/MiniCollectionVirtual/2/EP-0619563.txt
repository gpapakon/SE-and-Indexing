<ABSTRACT>
An automated transaction system employs a terminal for printing a value indicia, such 
as a postmark, on an article. The terminal contains a modular printer unit which has a 

printhead and a dedicated microprocessor physically permanently bonded together such 
that the printhead microprocessor cannot be physically tampered with without disabling 

the printhead. The modular printer unit includes a first supply of visible ink and a 
second supply of invisible ink, and an internal program for printing the value indicia 

with visible ink and an authentication code, which uniquely corresponds to the value 
indicia, with invisible ink. The invisible value indicia can be subsequently verified as 

authentic by machine reading of said invisible authentication code and comparing the 
authentication code for correspondence to the value indicia.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a modular printer for a
transaction terminal which has an input section for inputting
a request for printing a value indicia and an operating
section for enabling the terminal to execute the printing of
the requested value indicia on an article, and to such a
transaction terminal comprising a modular printer.The invention is applicable to an automated transaction
system which receives a user card having a microprocessor
for executing secure transactions in which an article or item
of value is dispensed from a terminal, and an account balance
stored in the card's memory is debited. In particular, the
invention is applicable to a postage transaction system in which a
postage account is maintained within the microprocessor card
and is used in transactions with postage printing and metering
terminals.A system for printing encrypted postage indicia is
described in EP-A-0 132 782. Apparatus for printing in
human-readable and machine-readable forms is described in
EP-A-0 011 721. Point-of-sale (POS) terminals and automated teller
machines (AT) have been widely used in conjunction with
various types of cards issued to users for sale or credit
transactions. For example, banks regularly issue account cards
which have a magnetically coded number stored on a stripe for
accessing the user's account through ATM terminals. Credit
cards which have coded magnetic stripes are inserted in ATM or
POS terminals to access a central account system for
authorization of a credit transaction. There also have been
proposals to use cards which have large non-volatile memories,
e.g. magnetic, integrated circuit (IC), or optical memory
storage, for storing and retrieving information specific to the
user, such as a medical history, biographical history,
maintenance of an account balance and transaction history, etc. These conventional systems generally employ a card
which has a passive memory that is read in a card reader or
computerized terminal maintained by a vendor. The security of
the cards is problematic since most account cards used
conventionally are passive and do not authenticate themselves
or the particular transactions for which they are used.
Instead, on-line access through a terminal to a central account
system, such as bank or credit card account records, is
required for confirmation of each transaction. This
requirement places an access time and cost burden on vendors,
such as bank branches and retail stores, which must maintain
the terminal facilities, as well as on the operator of the
central

dedicated microprocessor (41) for controlling the printhead

physically permanently bonded together such that the
printhead microprocessor (41) cannot be physically tampered

with without disabling the printhead;
the modular printer is removably mounted in the
terminal (20) ; and
the modular printer includes an interface coupled to
the printhead microprocessor (41) for establishing an

operative data path connection to the terminal operating
