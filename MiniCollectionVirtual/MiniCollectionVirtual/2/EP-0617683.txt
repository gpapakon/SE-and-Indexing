Device for separating two sheets made of flexible 
material, particularly two sheets (1, 2) made of synthetic 

material, which are initially applied against one 
another and are to be separated from one another for the 

insertion of at least one object or accessory (23) 
between these sheets, of the sort of those including two 

movable jaws (9) which can be brought together or moved 
apart from one another, on either side of the two sheets 

(1, 2) to be separated, and which are respectively 
equipped with members capable of grasping these two 

sheets and moving them in opposite directions, 
characterized 
in that
 each movable jaw (9) is mounted so that 
it can pivot about an axis (7) substantially coinciding 

with a fixed point (8) at which the sheets (1, 2) to be 
separated are held and is provided, in its part in 

register with the central region of the sheets (1, 2) to 
he separated, on the one hand, with at least one suction 

cup (16) capable of being connected to a vacuum source, 
and pointing towards the other jaw, and on the other 

hand, with needles (20) carried by a support (19) mounted 
so that it is translationally movable relative to the 

corresponding jaw (9) in a radial direction with respect 
to the axis of pivoting (7) of this jaw (9), the needles 

(20) of each jaw (9) being situated at the level of that 
face (17) of this jaw which points towards the other jaw, 

and being parallel to the direction of travel of their 
respective movable support (19), actuating means (13, 21) 

being provided on the one hand in order to cause the two 
jaws (9) to pivot simultaneously and in opposite directions 

and, on the other hand, in order to move the 
needles (20), engaging them between the two sheets (1, 2) 

to be moved apart. 
Device for separating two sheets made of flexible 
material according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

pivoting movement of the two jaws (9) is guided by 
circular arc-shaped lateral slideways (6) centred on the 

axis of pivoting (7) of the jaws, each jaw (9) including 
two lateral parallel parts (10), each equipped with two  

 
rollers (11, 12) or the like engaged in the corresponding 

circular arc-shaped slideway (6). 
Device for separating two sheets of flexible 
material according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 

the needles (20) associated with one of the movable jaws 

(9) are transversely offset with respect to the needles 
(20) associated with the other movable jaw (9) so that, 

in the position in which the two jaws (9) are brought 
together, the needles associated with one jaw take up a 

position between the needles associated with the other 
jaw. 
Device for separating two sheets made of flexible 
material according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 

in that each movable jaw (9) exhibits, on that 
one of its faces pointing towards the other jaw, a series 

of parallel recesses (22) of semi-cylindrical shape, 
formed in register with the transverse positions of all 

the needles (20) associated with the two jaws (9), so 
that in the position in which the two jaws (9) are 

brought together, their respective semi-cylindrical 
recesses (22) are brought into a coaxial position in 

order to delimit cylindrical housings capable of 
receiving the various needles (20). 
Device for separating two sheets made of flexible 
material according to Claim 4, characterized in that all 

the needles (20) and all the corresponding recesses (22) 
formed in the jaws (9) are transversely offset with 

respect to the positions of the suction cups (16) on 
these jaws (9), the suction cups (16) thus being situated 

between the needles (20).
