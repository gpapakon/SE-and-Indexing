<ABSTRACT>
A transducer assembly for a proximity sensor which 
comprises an elongated polymer piezoelectric film (16). 

The film (16) is supported as an elongated series of 
arcuate segments which are curved in the same direction 

and have the same radius of curvature (R). Electrodes 
(18) on both sides of the piezoelectric film (16) form 

opposed pairs, each pair being associated with a 

respective arcuate segment. The electrodes (18) are 
utilized for applying a varying electric field across 

the thickness of the film (16) to cause an ultrasonic 
acoustic wave to be radiated from the film (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ultrasonic proximity 
sensors and, more particularly, to an improved 
ultrasonic proximity sensor utilizing polymer 
piezoelectric film in the transducer assembly. Proximity sensors have many applications. For 
example, a proximity sensor mounted to a vehicle can 
provide a warning to the vehicle operator of the 
presence of an obstruction in the path of the vehicle. 
Thus, a proximity sensor mounted to the rear of a truck 
which is backing toward a loading dock can be utilized 
to alert the truck driver of the remaining distance to 
the loading dock. It is therefore an object of the 
present invention to provide a proximity sensor which 
may be utilized for such an application. A proximity sensor utilizing radiated and reflected 
ultrasonic acoustic waves is a desirable form for use in 
such an application. The desired beam pattern for 
obstruction detection applications is a straight, wide 
and thin beam. It is therefore another object of the 
present invention to provide a transducer assembly for 
generating an ultrasonic acoustic wave having such 
desired beam pattern. The foregoing and additional objects are attained 
in accordance with the principles of this invention by 
providing a transducer assembly for a proximity sensor 
which comprises an elongated polymer piezoelectric film. 
The assembly also includes means for supporting the film 
as an elongated series of arcuate segments. All of the 
arcuate segments are curved in the same direction and 
have the same radius of curvature. In addition, there 
is provided means for applying a varying electric field 
across the thickness of the film within each of the 
arcuate segments to cause an ultrasonic acoustic wave to 
be radiated from the film. In accordance with an aspect  
 
of this invention, the film supporting means includes a 
rigid backing member having a support surface shaped as 
an elongated series of arcuate segments all curved in 
the same direction and all having the same radius of 
curvature, and a rigid cover member adapted for 
placement so that the film is between the backing member 
and the cover member. The cover member has a cavity 
with an interior surface shaped complementarily to the 
backing member support surface. The film supporting 
means also includes means for securing the cover member 
to the backing member so that the film is tightly 
gripped between the backing member support surface and 
the cover member cavity interior surface. In accordance 
with a further aspect of this invention, the
