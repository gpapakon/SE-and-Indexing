<ABSTRACT>
- The subject of the invention relates to a system for controlling the fluid feed of a balancing ram (4) for a load, the system including a control unit (18) intended to allow the ram (4) to be fed with fluid at at least two different pressures, each one corresponding to a given direction of travel of the rod of the ram. -According to the invention, the control unit (18) is connected to means (17) for detecting the direction of travel of the load, these means being intended to be controlled by a lever handle (11) mounted so it can pivot in a limited way and providing both for the vertical displacement of the load and for the actuation of the detection means (17) during the upwards and downwards movements of the load.
