<ABSTRACT>
Diaphragm for use in cells for the electrolysis of alkaline halide solutions comprising: 100 parts by weight of asbestos fibres, 30 to 70 parts by weight of silica-based derivatives and 20 to 60 parts by weight of fluorinated polymers, deposited on a porous material. The weight ratio of the fluorinated polymers and the silica-based derivatives is between 0.6 to 1.2 and preferably between 0.6 to 0.9 with the exception of a diaphragm obtained by depositing a suspension comprising 100 parts by dry weight of asbestos fibres, 30 parts by dry weight of silica-based derivatives, 25 parts by dry weight of fluorinated polymers and 1.5 parts by dry weight of a thickening agent. The invention also concerns a method for the preparation of an optionally microporous diaphragm. The diaphragms of the invention are especially useful in aqueous alkaline halide solutions electrolysis cells.
