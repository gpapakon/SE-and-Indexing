<ABSTRACT>
The method for controlling the flow of a fluid through a fluid branch housing (3) consists in actuating a ram (14) pneumatically and directly using the fluid located inside the branch housing so as to close at least partially the branch outlet (3c) when the pressure of the fluid in the branch housing is greater than a predetermined pressure threshold (PO). Application: regulating the flow of supercharged air for an internal combustion engine.

A method of controlling the circulation of a fluid through a fluid bypass housing 
(3) which comprises an inlet (3a), a main outlet (3b), a secondary bypass outlet (3c) and 

selective closure means (7) of these outlets controlled by a jack (14), consisting in the 
pneumatic and direct actuation of the jack by the fluid located in the bypass housing so 

as at least partially to close the bypass outlet (3c) when the pressure of the fluid in the 
bypass housing is greater than a predetermined pressure threshold (PO) and partially to 

open the bypass outlet (3c) which is in the closed state when the temperature of the fluid 
in the bypass housing is lower than a first predetermined temperature threshold (T1), 

characterised in that use is made of mechanical means (24) within the bypass housing 
(3) acting directly on the selective closure means (7), these mechanical means being 

thermally deformable so that the temperature of the fluid in the bypass housing 
independently controls the partial opening of the bypass outlet by these mechanicai 

means. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that it consists in pneumatically 
actuating the jack (14) by a control fluid separate from the fluid passing through the 

bypass housing (3) so as to close the bypass outlet (3c) when the temperature of the 
fluid at the bypass outlet (3c) is greater than a second predetermined temperature 

threshold (T2). 
A device for implementing the method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, comprising a bypass housing (3) with an outer casing (3d) bounding a fluid inlet 

(3a), a main outlet (3b), a bypass outlet (3c) and an inner chamber for fluid, a closure 
shutter (7) pivoting in the inner chamber of the bypass housing between a position 

closing the main outlet and a position closing the bypass outlet, the piston rod (17) of a 
pneumatic jack (14) actuating the closure shutter via a pivoting arm (15) and the 

pivoting pin (7a) of the shutter, a connection duct (19) between the inner chamber and 
the cylinder (14a) of the jack establishing the fluid communication between the  

 
pneumatic jack and the inner chamber of the bypass housing and an elastic recall means 

(23) in the jack (14) whose recall force is selected as a function of the predetermined 
pressure threshold (PO) of the fluid in the bypass housing, this pneumatic jack (14) 

comprising a first piston (21) rigid with one end of the piston rod (17), characterised in 
that the pneumatic jack comprises a second piston (22) sliding axially with respect to 

the piston rod, the first piston being in contact with the recall spring (23) of the jack, the 
piston rod having an enlarged cylindrical portion (17a) forming an axial stop for the 

second piston in the cylinder (14a) of the jack and in that the closure shutter (7) 
comprises a central portion (7b) and a portion forming a lateral frame (7c) and a two-leaf 

spring (24) deformable thermally and acting on the two portions of the shutter 
respectively, so as to allow the partial opening of the shutter when the temperature of 

the fluid in the bypass housing (3) is lower than a predetermined temperature threshold 
(T1). 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the pneumatic jack (14) is 
connected by connection ducts (18, 19) to two separate pneumatic control sources. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the connection duct (19) 
between the pneumatic jack (14) and the bypass housing (3) comprises a non-return 

valve (19a). 
A device as claimed in one of claims 4 or 5, characterised in that it comprises a 

temperature sensor (8) for the fluid downstream of the bypass outlet (3c) of the bypass 
housing and an electrovalve (9) mounted on the connection duct (18) of one pneumatic 

control source, the electrovalve being opened if the temperature measured by the sensor 
exceeds a predetermined temperature threshold (T2). 
A device as claimed in one of claims 3 to 6, characterised in that it comprises a 
stop member for the closure shutter (7), this stop member being made from a thermally 

deformable memory alloy so as to obtain the partial opening of the shutter closing the  
 

bypass outlet (3c) when the temperature of the fluid in the bypass housing (3) is lower 
than a predetermined temperature threshold (T1). 
A system for regulating the supercharging air for an internal combustion engine 
(6) fitted with a device as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 7, characterised in that the 

bypass housing is mounted on a supercharging air/engine cooling fluid exchanger (2), 
the inlet (3a) of the bypass housing being combined with the outlet of the exchanger for 

the supercharging air, the main outlet (3b) of the bypass housing being connected to a 
supercharging air radiator (4) and the secondary bypass outlet (3c) of the bypass 

housing being connected directly to the engine supercharging air intake manifold. 
A regulation system as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that it comprises a 
temperature sensor (8) placed in the engine supercharging air intake manifold in order 

pneumatically to actuate the pneumatic jack (14) via an electrovalve (9). 
A regulation system as claimed in claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the air/fluid 
exchanger (2) is supplied with cooling fluid via a branch circuit (12) of the engine 

cooling circuit, the cooling fluid being discharged from the exchanger not being directly 
recycled to the engine intake.
