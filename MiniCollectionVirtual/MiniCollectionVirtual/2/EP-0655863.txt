<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
information recording method, an information recording 
apparatus and an information recording and reproducing 
apparatus, and more particularly to an information recording 
method, an information recording apparatus and an information 
recording and reproducing apparatus, which are used for 
multiplex-recording digital information coded with high 
efficiency on the basis of an existing format for multiplex-recording 
video information and audio information. As a recording medium to record a video signal with 
an audio signal etc., there are various media such as a 
magnetic tape and a video disc. At the same time, there are 
various recording formats (i.e. recording methods) to record 
information on these recording media. Especially, because of 
the demand to improve the quality of the information, there is 
a method of recording the audio signal, which is digitally 
modulated, together with the audio signal, which is recorded 
in the conventional analog form. In the field of the video 
disc, there is a format to multiplex and record digital  
 
signals. The spectrum of the signal recorded by this 
recording method of the video disc, which multiplexes the 
digital signals, is shown in FIG. 9A. A video FM carrier wave 
P which is obtained by frequency-modulating a first carrier 
wave (8.1 [MHz]) by a video signal, audio FM carrier waves A₁ 
and A₂ which are obtained by frequency-modulating a second 
carrier wave (2.30 [MHz]) and a third carrier wave (2.81 [MHz]) 
by left and right audio signals for stereo, and an EFM (Eight 
to Fourteen Modulation) signal E which is obtained by EFM-modulating 
digital data and limiting the band range of it by a 
cut-off frequency of 1.75 [MHz], are superimposed in the record 
signal as shown in FIG. 9A. On the other hand, in the field of movies, a film for 
theater-use is produced by use of a noise reduction technology, 
in which a high sound quality multi-channel digital sound is 
coded with high efficiency and is recorded. By this technique 
in the movie, a development of multi-channelling for home-use 
in the future is expected, so that the multi-channel audio 
method for home-use is under research, which allows the 
reproduction of a video software produced by the technique of 
high efficiency digital coding, in the field of audio and video 
apparatuses for home-use. However, in the presently available recording format 
of the video disc provided with a digital audio capability, it 
is not possible to record a new
