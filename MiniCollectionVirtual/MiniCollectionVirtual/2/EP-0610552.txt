<ABSTRACT>
Prepn of the sheet (I) which is self-vulcanising at elevated temp. without pressure, comprises prepn. of an elastomer mixt. (II) and moulding the mixt. to a sheet. Before and/or during the moulding process, the mixt. is degassed under reduced pressure. Also claimed is corrosion-resistant lining sheet (I) produced by this process.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of a corrosion-resistant, unvulcanised elastomeric liner 
which is completely self-vulcanising at normal pressure and elevated temperatures 

by producing an elastomer mixture and moulding the mixture to form a film, 
characterised in that the elastomer mixture is subjected to negative pressure 

resulting in degassing of the elastomer mixture before and/or during the moulding 
process. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised by the use of an elastomer mixture 
containing a halogenated diene rubber. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised by the use of an elastomer mixture 
containing chlorinated or brominated butyl rubbers. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised by the use of an elastomer mixture with 
the following composition: 


halogenated butyl rubber
100 phr 
elastomeric plasticiser
1 - 40 preferably 10 phr 
carbon black
10 - 200 preferably 95 phr 
processing aid
0.5 - 15 preferably 5 phr 
metal oxide
0.5 - 30 preferably 5 phr 
accelerator
1 - 10 preferably 5 phr.
