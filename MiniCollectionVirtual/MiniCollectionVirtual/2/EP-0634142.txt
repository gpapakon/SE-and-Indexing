<ABSTRACT>
A sterile one piece suture clip comprising, an insertion 
member having a distal end, a proximal end, a dorsal 

surface, a first side and a second side; near the 
proximal end on the first side is located a first 

surface and opposed to said surface on the second side a 
second surface, located toward the distal end adjacent 

to the first surface is a channel, said channel oriented 
transversely across the dorsal surface; spaced laterally 

from said channel said first side surface having a 
locking notch; and a receiving member having a receiving 

opening, a passage, a second opening and a means for 
engaging the notch of said insertion member; where the 

receiving member is adapted to allow the insertion 
member to be slid within the receiving member and 

retained in said receiving member by the locking action 
of said engaging means with the locking notch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical clip. More
particularly, it relates to a clip suitably adapted to
replace a suture knot during endoscopic surgery.One of the truly great advances in recent years to
reduce the invasiveness of surgical procedures is
endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic surgery involves the use
of an endoscope which is an instrument permitting the
visual inspection and magnification of any cavity of the
body. The endoscope is inserted through a cannula after
puncture through the wall of the body cavity with a
trocar, which is a sharp-pointed instrument. The
surgeon can then perform diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures at the surgical site with the aid of
specialized instrumentation designed to fit through
additional cannulas providing small diameter openings
into the desired body cavity as may be required.An age-old procedure which surgeons are required to
perform to repair or reconstruct traumatized bodily
tissue is suturing. Fortunately, medical instruments
have been recently designed to allow a surgeon to
manipulate a suture, or suture and needle combination,
through the small diameter opening of a cannula.
However, the ability to tie an appropriately placed
suture knot had become troublesome and problematical. Therefore, in response to this problem, surgeons have
sought alternatives to conventional knot-tying
techniques which would be suitable during endoscopic
surgery. These alternatives include the use of
hemostatic clips, which are designed to ligate blood
vessels and other tubular members, to replace suture
knots. Such hemostatic clips are described, for
example, in U.S. Pat Nos. 4,418,694 and 4,476,865.
These clips can be readily applied with a clip applier
which is designed to function through the small opening
of a cannula. Unfortunately, the force required to
displace these clips from a suture is too low to provide
a secure knot. As a result, hemostatic clips of the
type shown in the art are unsuitable for use as
endoscopic knot clips.From FR-A-2682867, a surgical suture clip, having the features
as defined in the preamble of claim 1, is known.In view of the deficiencies of the prior art for
creating a useful alternative to tying a suture knot,
what is desired within the medical community is a device
suitable for application using endoscopic techniques
which can successfully replace the suture knot. More
specifically, what is needed is a clip particularly
adapted for replacing a suture knot during endoscopic
surgery, and which exhibits adequate clamping force to
function

<CLAIMS>
A sterile surgical suture clip (2) comprising an
insertion member (4) having means for retaining one

or more sutures (1), a locking notch (24)
being engageable with an

engaging means (14) located on a receiving member (6),
said receiving member (6) having a passage (10)

provided with a first opening (8) and a second opening
(12), said receiving member (6) being adapted to allow

the insertion member (4) to be slid within said
passage (10) of the receiving member (6) and to be

locked in said receiving member (6) by the
interaction of said engaging means (14) with the

locking notch (24) to lock the suture, and
characterised

in that the insertion member (4) is provided with a retaining
notch (28) such

that when the insertion member (4) is
retained in said receiving member (6) by the

interaction of said engaging means (14) with the
retaining notch (28), the one or

more sutures (1) may be placed in said means for retaining
one or more sutures (1).
A sterile surgical suture clip (2) according to claim
1 wherein the means for retaining one or more sutures

(1) comprises a channel (22) and opposite guides (37

&
 39) into which one or more sutures (1) may be placed.
A sterile surgical suture clip (2) according to claim
1 or 2 wherein the insertion member (4) and receiving

member (6) have a circular cross section.
A sterile surgical suture clip (2) according to any
one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the one or more sutures

(1) comprises two ends of one looped suture (1).
