<ABSTRACT>
White liquor from a paper making operation is passed downwardly through a 
contacting column 12 and is contacted by an ascending stream of oxygen 

containing gas. As a result, the sodium sulphide content of the white liquor is 
thereby oxidised to sodium sulphate. Rapid oxidation is achieved by operating 

the column 12 at a temperature of about 110°C or higher and at a pressure of at 
least 9.2 atmospheres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to white liquor utilised in the pulping of wood. Even
more particularly, the present invention relates to a method of producing oxidised
white liquor in which sodium sulphide contained within the white liquor is oxidised to
sodium sulphate.An initial stage in the production of wood pulp for paper making is the delignification
of wood chips by the use of reprocessed white liquor. White liquor is typically an
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (76 g/l), sodium carbonate (19 g/l), sodium
sulphide (33 g/l) and sodium sulphate (2 g/l). The foregoing concentrations are
exemplary only and each component could be more or less than that stated
hereinbefore. The delignification creates black liquor which is concentrated in an
evaporator. After concentration, the black liquor is burned in a furnace to produce
an inorganic residue, known in the art as smelt. The smelt is dissolved in water to
produce green liquor which is further processed in causticizing and clarifying stages
to produce the white liquor. The white liquor is recycled back to the initial cooking
stage. Some mills use oxidised white liquor (thiosulphate) for oxygen delignification.The successive pulp bleaching stages can consist of oxygen delignification, chlorine
dioxide, oxidative extraction, with or without hydrogen peroxide or separate peroxide
stages. Peroxide in oxidative extraction stages is consumed by the sodium
thiosulphate present in conventionally processed white liquor should the liquor be
used as a source of alkali. Hydrogen peroxide is expensive and its depletion adds
an unnecessary cost burden to the bleaching process.It is known that it would be very advantageous to render the white liquor inert to
expensive oxidising agents such as peroxide by oxidation of the sodium sulphide.
Thereafter the oxidised white liquor could be utilized within alkaline oxidising
bleaching stages. The use of such oxidised white liquor would make it possible not
only to economically improve the pulp production process through a reduction of the
consumption of peroxide but also, to improve the product quality of the pulp. To this 
end, oxidised white liquor has been produced in which sodium sulphide is oxidised
to sodium thiosulphate. Further oxidation would of course render the sodium
sulphide inert to the action of powerful oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and
chlorine dioxide, but the oxidation of sodium sulphide to sodium sulphate has proved
to be impractical due to slow reaction rates.EP-A-543 135 relates mainly to the
