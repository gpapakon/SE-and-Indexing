<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a protease from Paecilomyces lilacinus, a process 
for the preparation of the protease, which comprises cultivation of 

Paecilomyces lilacinus and isolation of said protease. More generally the 
invention relates to the use of the protease for the controll of plant 

parasitic nematodes. The invention further relates to the gene for this 
protease.

<DESCRIPTION>
In many crops nematodes are important parasites. Chemical control of these 
parasites meet with growing objections because of environmental effects. 
Alternatives of these control measurements have to be developed. Biological 
control of nematodes seems to be a good alternative. Many fungi parasitize on 
plant parasitic nematodes, either by capturing nematodes or by parasitizing the 
nematode eggs. Several fungi are capable to penetrate the eggs of nematodes (Bursnall & Tribe 
(1974), Stirling & Mankau (1979), Chalupova & Lenhart (1984), Kunert et al. 
(1987), Dackmann et al. (1989) and Gaspard et al. (1990). Those fungi are 
important objects for research concerning potential use as biological control 
agents of nematodes. Hyphae of Dactylella oviparasitica grow rapidly through 
egg-masses of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne spp. and the fungus 
penetrated egg-shells (Stirling & Mankau (1979). Dackmann et al. (1989) 
investigated fungal egg-parasites isolated from eggs of the cyst nematode 
Heterodera avenae with respect to their ability to infact cyst nematode eggs of 
H. schachtii in vitro. Of these Verticillium suchlasporium appeared to be the 
most effective parasite. Gaspard et al. (1990) and de Leij & Kerry (1991) 
reported on Verticillium chlamydosporium as control agent for Meloidogyne spp. 
Also the nematode egg-parasitic fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus (Thom) Samson 
has been studied for its ability to control root-knot nematodes (Jatala et al. 
(1979, 1980), Dunn et al. (1982), Villanueva & Davide (1984), Davide & Batino 
(1985), Culbreath et a (1986), Dube & Smart (1987), Cabanillas & Barker 
(1989), Cabanillas et al. (1989), Gaspard et al. (1990). The mechanism of the infection process of egg-parasitic fungi could be 
mechanical and/or enzymatic in nature. Little is known about the role of  
 
enzymes involved. To date few attempts have been made to determine the 
effects of purified fungal enzymes on the egg-shell of the root-knot nematode. 
Research on enzymes of nematode egg-parasitic fungi was done in liquid culture 
of Dactylella oviparasitica supplemented with colloidal chitin. Stirling & Mankau 
(1979) found chitinase activity and suggested a role for this enzyme in 
pentrating the egg-shell, which consists partly of chitin. If any other enzyme 
was involved was unclear. Dackmann et al. (1989) showed a correlation 
between infection of egg-parasites of cyst nematode eggs Heterodera schachtii 
in vitro and lytic enzyme activity. Especially chitinase and protease activity seemed to be
