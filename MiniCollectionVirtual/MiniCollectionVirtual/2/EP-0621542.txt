<ABSTRACT>
An automatic language-determining apparatus automatically determines the 
particular European language of the text image of a document when the gross script-type is 

known to be, or is determined to be, an European script-type. A word token generating means 
generates word tokens from the text image. A feature determining means (30) determines the 

frequency of appearance of word tokens of the text portion which correspond to 
predetermined word tokens. A language determining means converts the determined 

frequency of appearance rates to a point in a new coordinate space, then determines which 
predetermined region of the new coordinate space the point is closest to, to determine the 

language of the text portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for automatically determining the language of a
document according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a respective method according to the
preamble of claim 6.Optical character recognition and the use of optical character recognition to convert
scanned image data into text data suitable for use in a digital computer is well known. In
addition, methods for converting scanned image data into text data and the types of errors
such methods generate are well known. However, the selection of a proper method for error
correction is highly dependent upon the language of the document. Conventionally, the
methods for optical character recognition and for error correction in optical character
recognition systems have been provided on the assumption that the language used in the
document is known in advance or assumed to be in the language of the country in which the
system is being used. That is, in the United States, conventional optical character recognition
systems would assume that the document is in English. Alternately, an optical character
recognition system can be implemented with the character recognition and error resolution
methods for a plurality of languages.However, it has heretofore not been possible to have the optical character
recognition system automatically determine the language of the document. Rather, as each
document is provided to the optical character recognition system, some indication of the
particular language of the document must be provided to the optical character recognition
system. This has been accomplished by either having the operator input data concerning the
language of the document to the optical character recognition system, or by having the
document provided with special markings which indicate the language of the document. US-A-4 907 283 discloses an image processing apparatus for searching any character
string of a sentence input as an image. Characters of the input sentence image as well as
of the text to be analysed are converted by using a specific code having only a few bits and
being different from a standard character code. The encoding enables a simplified image
processing and in particular a simpler and faster determination of a coincidence/non-coincidence
of any character string with the input sentence image.US-A-5 062 143 discloses a trigram-based method of language identification. According to
that method, a body of text is passed into successive strings of characters. These strings of
characters are compared with character

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for determining a language of a text portion of a document (100)
having a known script-type including input means (24) for inputting a digital data

signal representative of the text portion (104) of the document, the text portion
being in an unknown language;
characterized by
word token generating means (28) for converting the digital data signal to a
plurality of word tokens, each word token encoding a word from said text portion in the unknown

language according to an abstract character code and comprising at least one abstract-coded character, each abstract,
coded character representing one of a plurality of character classes, each

character class comprising a group of characters of the known script-type;
determining means (30) for determining, for each of at least one predetermined
word token, a number of occurrences of each predetermined word token within the

plurality of word tokens;
frequency determining means (32) for determining a frequency of occurrence rate for

each predetermined word token within the plurality of word tokens;
and conversion means (32) for converting all said frequency of occurrence rates

to a single point in a coordinate space; and
language determining means (32) for determining the language represented by
that region in the coordinate space, which is closest to the location of the single

point, to be the language of the text portion.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at least one predetermined
word token is at least one of "AAx", "Ax" and "Aix", where:


the abstract-coded character A represents the character class containing
characters having ascenders and a single connected component; 
the abstract-coded character x represents the character class containing
characters having no ascenders, no descenders and a single connected

component; and
the abstract-coded character i represents the character class containing
characters having no ascenders, no descenders and two connected components.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the language determining
means includes:


proximity determining means for determining a closest one of a plurality of
predetermined regions within the coordinate space to the point, each

predetermined region having a corresponding language, the language
corresponding to the closest region being determined as the language of the text

portion.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein each predetermined region
corresponds to a different one of a plurality of languages.
The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the plurality of
languages including English, French and German.
A method for automatically determining a language of a document (100) having a
text portion (104), the text portion having a known script-type and being in an

unknown language;
characterized by
converting the text portion of the document to word tokens to form a
converted text portion, each word token encoding a word from said text portion in the unknown

language according to an abstract character code and comprising at least one abstract-coded character, each abstract-coded
character representing one of a plurality of character classes, each

character class comprising a group of characters of the known script-type;
determining, for each of at least one predetermined word token, a number of
occurrences of each predetermined word token within the converted text portion;
determining a frequency of occurrence rate for each at least one predetermined
word tokens within the converted text portion;
converting all said frequency of occurrence rates to a single point in a coordinate space; and
determining the language represented by that region in the coordinate space,
which is closest to the location of the single point, to be the language of the text

portion.
The method of automatic language determination as claimed in claim 6, wherein
the language determining step includes


dividing the coordinate space into at least one predetermined region, each
predetermined region having a corresponding language,
determining which at least one predetermined region is closest to the point; and
selecting the corresponding language of the closest predetermined region as the
language of the text portion.
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein each predetermined region comprises
a plurality of points, each of the plurality of points corresponding to a document in

the corresponding language, and

wherein the step of determining the closest predetermined region comprises the
steps of:
determining a centroid of each predetermined region based on locations of the
plurality of points;
determining, for each predetermined region, a centroid distance between the point
and the centroid; and
selecting the predetermined region having a smallest centroid distance as the
closest predetermined region.
