<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire is provided having good rolling 
resistance properties without sacrificing traction. 

The tire has a tread that contains 2 to 15 phr 
thermoplastic reinforcing polymer as a replacement for 

5 to 25 phr carbon black.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tires that have improved
rolling resistance while retaining good traction
properties.Conventionally tires are loaded with high surface area
carbon black to provide good traction and good handling
properties and a good cornering coefficient. A high level
of fine carbon black, however, causes the tires to have a
high hysteresis, which contributes to a high rolling
resistance.In the prior art, it is the general rule that improved
traction can only be achieved by sacrificing rolling
resistance, and rolling resistance can be improved only at
the expense of traction.In the conception of the present invention, it was
proposed that if the level of carbon black was reduced, and
the omitted carbon black was replaced with a filler
material that reduced the hysteresis of the tread compound
while maintaining stiffness, that rolling resistance could
be improved, with only a slight or negligible change in
traction.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 009, no. 249(M-419), 5
Oct. 1985 (& JP-A-60/099702) discloses a rubber composite
obtained by combining natural rubber with rubber
reinforcing constituents; a polymer and vulcanizable rubber
are grafted with each other via primary condensation of
phenol-formaldehyde resin.FR A-1 182 038 discloses vulcanizable rubber
compositions including natural or synthetic rubber and
isotactic polypropylene.EP-A-445 486 discloses rubber compositions having
increased modulus, prepared by the formation of
polypropylene fibrils randomly dispersed throughout the
rubber matrix.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
tire with improved rolling resistance, while traction is
maintained. Other objects of the invention will be apparent from
the following description and claims.A pneumatic tire is provided comprising a pair of
axially spaced apart annular beads, carcass plies wrapped
around the beads, reinforcing belt plies disposed over the
carcass plies in a crown area of the tire, tread disposed
over the belt plies in the crown area, and sidewalls
disposed between the tread and beads. The tread comprises
a polymer blend of 2-15 parts by weight thermoplastic
reinforcing polymer per 100 parts by weight tread rubber
(2-15 phr). In the illustrated embodiment, the polymer
blend has a 50% modulus of 1.3 to 2.5 and a rebound of 70
to 75%.The improved properties described herein are observed
when the reinforcing polymer is mixed into the tread rubber
in a two step process where reinforcing polymer domains are
predeveloped in a master batch as a first step in the
process

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic tire (30) comprising a pair of

axially spaced annular beads (32), carcass plies (34)
wrapped around said beads, reinforcing belt plies (36)

disposed over said carcass plies in a crown area of said
tire, tread (38,42) disposed over said belt plies in said

crown area, and sidewalls (40) disposed between said tread
(38,42) and said beads (32), said tire being characterized

by tread rubber in a ground contacting portion (38) of said
tread comprising a polymer blend of 2-15 phr thermoplastic

reinforcing polymer replacing 5-25 phr carbon black in
tread rubber wherein said carbon black is present in said

tread rubber at a concentration of 30-42.6 phr, said tread
rubber having a 50% modulus of 1.3 to 2.5 and a rebound of

70-75%, wherein said ground contacting tread rubber
composition is prepared by the sequential steps of (a)

blending 100 parts by weight rubber with thermoplastic
polymer to form a polymer alloy having a resin content of

15 to about 20 phr; and, (b) blending additional sulfur
curable rubber with a sufficient amount of said polymer

alloy to form a rubber composition having a thermoplastic
resin content of 2 to 15 phr.

thermoplastic polymer being polyamide or polypropylene and

said tread rubber being selected from the group consisting
of cis-1,4-polyisoprene (natural or synthetic), cis-1,4-polybutadiene,

3,4-polyisoprene, styrene/butadiene
copolymers, styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymers,

butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, isoprene/acrylonitrile
copolymers, and combinations thereof.
