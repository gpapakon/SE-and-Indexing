<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thrombin inhibitors which 
are useful anticoagulants in humans and animals. In particular 
it relates to derivatives of the dipeptide L-Proline-L-Arginine 
aldehyde having high antithrombotic activity. Thrombin inhibition is currently achieved by the 
administration of heparins and coumarins. The mechanism by 
which these agents act has been much studied. Heparins are only 
administerable parenterally and levels must be carefully 
monitored. Coumarins act by blocking or inhibiting the 
formation of prothrombin and require some time to achieve 
maximum effectiveness. Although both the heparins and the coumarins are 
effective anticoagulants, there exists a need for antithrombin 
agents which act quickly to prevent clot formation and which do 
not interfere with plasmin action in dissolving existing clots. The present invention is directed to the unexpected 
discovery that the compound of the present invention, is 
considerably more potent as a thrombin inhibitor than the 
corresponding 4aS, 8aS enantiomer. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present 
invention to provide (1R, 4aR, 8aR)-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydroisoquinolin-1-carbonyl-(L)-prolinyl-(L)-arginine 
aldehyde and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates 
thereof that is a surprisingly more potent thrombin inhibitor 
and is useful as an anticoagulant and thromboembolic disorder 
agent. The thrombin inhibiting compound provided by this 
invention is represented by the following formula 1.  
 
 
wherein A is 
 
   and the pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts 
and solvates thereof. The peptide represented by the formula 1 is a useful 
antithrombotic agent and can be used as an adjunct to tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase or urokinase therapy. The compound is prepared by conventional coupling 
methods as disclosed in EP O 479 489 A2; U.S. 5,250,660; and 
U.S. 5,252,566. For example, Cbz-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydro-1-isoquinolincarboxylic 
acid is coupled with an ester of L-proline 
to form Cbz-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydroisoquinolin-1-carbonyl-Pro 
ester. The ester group is removed and the Cbz-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydroisoquinolin-1-carbonyl-Pro 
is coupled with the lactam 
form of L-arginine to provide Cbz-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydroisoquinolin-1-carbonyl-Pro-Arg 
lactam in amino protected 
form. The Arg lactam ring is opened by reduction and the 
arginine amino and perhydroisoquinoline nitrogen protecting 
groups removed to provide 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-perhydroisoquinolin-1-carbonyl-Pro-Arg 
aldehyde.
