<ABSTRACT>
A waterproof connecting device (11) for retrospectively fitting the inner side of a water-permeable item of clothing with a functional layer of clothing with a waterproof, water vapour-permeable functional layer. A functional layer strip (13) is provided, having a first longitudinal side of the functional layer strip which can be connected to a longitudinal side edge (21) of the functional layer of clothing, and having a second longitudinal side of the functional layer strip which is opposed to said first longitudinal side and on which a functional layer covering panel (15) is provided. Additionally, an outside connecting strip (27) is provided, having a first longitudinal side edge of the outside connecting strip, which side edge is attached between the two longitudinal sides of the functional layer strip on the outer side of the functional layer strip (13), and having a second longitudinal side edge of the outside connecting strip which is opposed to said first longitudinal side edge and can be connected to the item of clothing. Furthermore, an inside connecting strip (39) is provided, having a first longitudinal side edge of the inside connecting strip which is provided on the functional layer strip (13) in the region of the functional layer covering panel (15), and having a second longitudinal side edge of the inside connecting strip which is opposed to said first longitudinal side edge and can be connected to a fastener device (49) of the functional layer of clothing to be arranged on the inner side of the functional layer strip (13) and below the functional layer covering panel (15) for closing and opening the functional layer of clothing.

strip (15, 15') is formed integrally with 
the functional layer strip (13, 13') and the internal 

connecting strip (39, 39') is attached to 
the inside of the functional layer strip (13, 13')  

 
by means of a second adhesive seam (37, 37') of 

waterproof adhesive material. 
A connecting device according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that the lining connecting strip 

(41, 41') is formed integrally with the internal 
connecting strip (39, 39') and the lining connecting 

strip (41, 41') extends away from the 
second adhesive seam (69, 69') on the side of the 

second adhesive seam (69, 69') facing away from 
the functional layer covering strip (15, 15').
