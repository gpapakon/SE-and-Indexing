<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an expandable
stent (10) for implantation in a body lumen, such as an

artery, and a method for making it from a single length
of tubing. The stent (10) consists of a plurality of

radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) generally

aligned on a common axis and interconnected by one or
more interconnective elements (13). The individual

radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) consist of
ribbon-like material disposed in an undulating pattern.

The stents (10) are made by coating a length of tubing
(21) with an etchant-resistive material and then

selectively removing portions of the coating to form a
pattern for the stent (10) on the tubing (21) to expose

the portions of the tubing to be removed. This may be
done by machine-controlled activation and relative

positioning of a laser (24) in conjunction with the
coated tubing (21). After the patterning of the tubing

(21), the stent (10) is formed by removing exposed
portions of the tubing (21) by an etching process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to expandable endoprosthesis devices, generally called stents, which are adapted to be implanted into a patient's body lumen, such as blood vessel, to maintain the patency thereof. These devices are very useful in the treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels.Stents are generally tubular shaped devices which function to hold open a segment of a blood vessel or other anatomical lumen. They are particularly suitable for use to support and hold back a dissected arterial lining which can occlude the fluid passageway therethroughFurther details of prior art stents can be found in U.S. Patent 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al.); U.S. Patent 4,512,338 (Balko et al.); U.S. Patent 4,553,545 (Maass et al.); U.S. Patent 4,733,665 (Palmaz); U.S. Patent 4,762,128 (Rosenbluth); U.S. Patent 4,800,882 (Gianturco); U.S. Patent 4,856,516 (Hillstead); and U.S. Patent 4,886,062 (Wiktor).Various means have been described to deliver and implant stents. One method frequently described for delivering a stent to a desired intralumenal location includes mounting the expandable stent on an expandable member, such as a balloon, provided on the distal end of an intravascular catheter, advancing the catheter to the desired location within the patient's body lumen inflating the balloon on the catheter to expand the stent into a permanent expanded condition and then deflating the balloon and removing the catheter. One of the difficulties encountered using prior stents involved maintaining the radial rigidity needed to hold open a body lumen while at the same time maintaining the longitudinal flexibility of the stent to facilitate its delivery.What has been needed and heretofore unavailable is a stent which has a high degree of flexibility so that it can be advanced through tortuous passageways and can be readily expanded and yet have the mechanical strength to hold open the body lumen into which it is expanded.One prior art device which goes some way towards addressing this problem is described in US-A-4,994,071. The described stent includes a trunk portion constructed from a series of half-hitch connections which extend along an axial dimension. In combination the series of loops form a generally cylindrical lattice or matrix.The present invention is directed to an expandable stent which is relatively flexible along its longitudinal axis to facilitate delivery through tortuous body lumens, but which is stiff and stable enough radially in an expanded condition to maintain the patency of a body lumen such as
