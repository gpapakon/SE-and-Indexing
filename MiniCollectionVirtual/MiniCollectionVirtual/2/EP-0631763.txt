<ABSTRACT>
A tubular body (1) made of wire, preferably titanium wire, produced on a circular knitting machine, is inserted in the cavity (3c) of a pressing tool (3) with a pressing mould (3b) and a die (3a). The tubular body (1) is plastically deformed by the die (3a) moving into the cavity (3c), so that the body (1) assumes the shape predetermined by the pressing mould (3b) and is thus transformed into a body (4) which can be inserted as filler (4) into bone cavities, for example as a medullary space barrier.

<CLAIMS>
A filling member made from metal for bone cavities, which 
is made from a knitted fabric (2d) having at least one 

wire (2), with the knitted fabric (2d) being compressed 
by plastic deformation to a three-dimensional shape which 

is substantially smaller when compared with its original 
dimensions. 
A filling member according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 it is made of a single wire (2). 
A filling member according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the wire (2) has a diameter in the 
range between 0.1 mm and 0.8 mm. 
A filling member according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the wire (2) is made from pure 
titanium. 
A filling member according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the filling member (4) comprises an 
easily cohesive shape which may be cylindrical, conical, 

in the shape of a truncated cone or cubic. 
A process for the manufacture of a filling member made 
from metal for bone cavities, in which a knitted fabric 

(2d) is manufactured with a knitting machine from one or 
more wires (2), and the knitted fabric (2d) is 

subsequently supplied to a pressing device (3) and is 
compressed by plastic deformation to a substantially 

smaller three-dimension shape in comparison with its 
original dimensions, so that the shape of the filling 

member (4) is produced by plastic deformation.  
 
A process according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the knitted fabric (2d) is 
manufactured on a round knitting machine as a tubular 

body (1). 
A process according to Claim 6 or 7,
characterised in that
 the ends of the wire (2), which the 
knitted fabric (2d) has, are inserted into the knitted 

fabric (2d) before the pressing operation. 
A process according to one of Claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that
 the porosity of the filling member 
is determined by the wire diameter and/or by the wire 

cross section and/or by the pressure.
