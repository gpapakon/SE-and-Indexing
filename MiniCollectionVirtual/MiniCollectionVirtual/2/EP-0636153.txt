A) oligomers having at least two acrylic ester and/or 
methacrylic ester groups per molecule and 
B) polyamines, 
 
characterized in that the polyamines are diamines 

having a primary and a tertiary amino group and the 
ratio of primary amino groups of B) to (meth)acrylic 

double bonds of A) is 0.01:1 to 0.2:1, preferably 
0.03:1 to 0.1:1. 
Addition products according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that esters of acrylic acid and/or 

methacrylic acid and tri- and/or tetrahydric alcohols 
are used as component A).

characterized in that N,N-dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane 

is used as component B). 
Process for the preparation of the addition 
products according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that esters A) and polyamines B) are 
reacted with one another, if appropriate in an organic 

solvent, with the use of polymerization inhibitors. 
Radiation-curable surface coating compositions, 
which contain the addition products according to Claim 

1 to 4 and photoinitiators and, if desired, ethylenically 
unsaturated, photopolymerizable compounds 

and, if desired, further radiation-curable binders and, 
if desired, further customary auxiliaries and additives 

and, if desired, water and, if desired, neutralizing 
agents.
