<ABSTRACT>
A plastic bag (30) having a reclosable plastic zipper (42) is 
provided with a tamper-evident, non-reclosable peel seal (40) 

formed by coextruding an adhesive (38) onto a side strip adjacent 
to the interlocking zipper (42). The coextrusion causes the 

adhesive to preferentially adhere to the side strip when the 
peel seal (40) is broken. A method for manufacturing the 

reclosable plastic zipper (42) includes the steps of coextruding 
a zipper profile including a plane area with an adhesive (38) on 

the plane area, slitting the profile lengthwise, and folding 
lover one of the resulting sides of the zipper to interlock 

them with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This relates in general to the packaging art, and more 
particularly is concerned with a continuous reclosable 
plastic zipper of a type which is used to close the mouth of 
a bag or package, and which includes, either before or after 
the zipper relative to the mouth of the bag or package, a 
tamper-evident non-reclosable peel-seal feature. In the use of plastic bags and packages, particularly 
for foodstuffs, it is important that the bag be hermetically 
sealed until the purchaser acquires the bag and its 
contents, takes them home, and opens the bag or package for 
the first time. It is then commercially attractive and 
useful for the consumer that the bag or package be 
reclosable so that its contents may be protected. Flexible 
plastic zippers have proven to be excellent for reclosable 
bags, because they may be manufactured with high-speed 
equipment and are reliable for repeated reuse. A typical 
zipper is one which has a groove at one side of the bag  
 
mouth and a rib at the other side, which rib may interlock 
into the groove when the sides of the mouth of the bag are 
pressed together. Alternatively, a member having a 
plurality of ribs may be on one side of the bag mouth, while 
a member having a plurality of channels may be on the other 
side, the ribs locking into the channels when the sides of 
the mouth of the bag are pressed together. In such a case, 
there may be no difference in appearance between the two 
members, as the ribs may simply be the intervals between 
channels on a strip which may lock into another of the same 
kind. In general, and in short, some form of male/female 
interengagement is used to join the two sides of the bag 
mouth together. The so-called members, or strips, are 
bonded in some manner to the material from which the bags 
themselves are manufactured. Usually, pull flanges extend above the rib and groove 
strips, which pull flanges may be pulled apart for access to 
the interior of the bag. Although flexible zippers of this variety are quite 
popular, they do not always prevent the inadvertent or 
unwelcome opening of a bag or package within the store, and 
various additions have been made to provide tamper-evident 
seals which would reveal when it has been opened prior to 
purchase.

A method for forming a tamper-evident, non-reclosable 
peel seal for a reclosable plastic bag, comprising the steps 

of: 

coextruding a first flexible plastic web (22;32b) having an 
interlockable rib and groove member and a side strip 

adjacent thereto from a polymeric resin material with an 
adhesive (26;38;52;100), said adhesive being coextruded onto said side 

strip, so that it preferentially adheres thereto; 
extruding a second flexible plastic web (20;32a) having an 
interlockable rib and groove member, said second flexible 

plastic web (20;32a) thereby being interlockable with said first 
flexible plastic web (22;32b), and a side strip adjacent thereto; 
pressing said side strips of said first and second 
flexible plastic webs (20,22;32b,32a) together under heat; and permitting 

said first and second flexible plastic webs to cool so that 
said adhesive (26;38;52;100) forms a hermetic, tamper-evident non-reclosable 

peel seal between said side strips of said first 
and second flexible plastic webs (20,22;32b,32a), and so that all of said 

adhesive (26;38;52;100) remains on said side strip of said first 
flexible plastic web (22;32b) when said peel seal is broken. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step of 
pressing said side strips of said first and second flexible 

plastic webs (20,22;32b,32a) together under heat comprises passing said side 
strip of said first flexible plastic web (22;32b) over a first 

sealing bar and passing said side strip of said second 
flexible plastic web (20;32a) over a second sealing bar, said first  

 
and second sealing bars being heated and pressing said side 

strips of said first and second flexible plastic webs 
(20,22;32b,32a) together. 
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein one of said 
sealing bars is at a higher temperature than the other of 

said sealing bars. 
A method for manufacturing a reclosable zipper having 
a tamper-evident, non-reclosable peel seal for a reclosable 

plastic bag comprising: 

coextruding a profile (62) having interlockable rib and 
groove members and two plane areas from a polymeric resin 

material with an adhesive (26;38;52;100), said adhesive being coextruded 
onto one of said two plane areas (22;32b), so that it 

preferentially adheres thereto, and so that all of said 
adhesive (26;38;52;100) remains on said one of said two plane areas when 

said peel seal is broken; 
slitting said profile (62) longitudinally to produce two 
interlockable sides (20,22) of said zipper, one side having said 

plane area with said adhesive (100); and 
folding over one of said two sides (20,22) of said zipper, so 
that said plane area (22) with said adhesive (100) faces the other (20) of 

said two plane areas, and so that said rib and groove 
members be interlocked with one another. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 further comprising the 
step of interlocking said rib and groove members with one 

another. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said slitting 
step is performed longitudinally through said interlockable 

rib and groove members. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said slitting 
step is performed longitudinally between said two plane 

areas (20,22). 
A method as claimed in claim 4 further comprising the 

steps of: 

providing a first ply and a second ply of plastic sheet 
material (34), 
welding said first ply of plastic sheet material to one (32b) 
of said two sides of said zipper; and 
welding said second ply of plastic sheet material (34) to 
the other (32a) of said two sides of said zipper. 
A method in accordance with claim 2 wherein one or more 
of the temperature, dwell time and pressure of said first 

and second sealing bars is adjusted so that the bond between 
said adhesive (26;38;52;100) and said first web (22;32b) is greater than the 

cohesive force of said adhesive (26;38;52;100) which in turn is greater 
than the adhesive force between said adhesive (26;38;52;100) and said 

second web (20;32a).  
 
A web comprising a set of interengaging elements and 
having a coextruded adhesive layer (26;38;52;100) formed on an inward-facing 

component (24) thereof, so that said web (22;32b) may be joined 
with a second web (20;32a) having interengaging elements with a peel 

seal formed by said coextruded adhesive layer (26;38;52;100) adhering to 
said second web (20;32a) with a force lower than the force by which the 

adhesive adheres to said first web (22;32b) due to the coextrusion process, 
said peel seal being broken by disengaging 

said coextruded adhesive layer (26;38;52;100) completely from said second 
web (20;32a), whereby said second web is completely free of adhesive. 
A reclosable plastic package having a tamper-evident, 
non-reclosable peel seal comprising a first flexible plastic 

web (22,32b) having a male zipper member and a side strip adjacent 
thereto, and a second flexible plastic web (20;32a) having a female 

zipper member and a side strip adjacent thereto, said first 
and second flexible plastic webs (20,22;32b,32a) being interlocked together 

when said male zipper member is locked into said female 
zipper member, said side strips of said first and second 

flexible plastic webs facing one another when said male and 
female zipper members are interlocked, 

characterized in that 
one (22,32b) of said side 

strips has an adhesive (26;38;52;100) preferentially adhered thereto, 
said peel seal being formed from said adhesive (26;38;52;100) by pressing 

said side strips of said first and second flexible plastic 
webs (20,22;32b,32a) 

together at an elevated temperature, whereby the force 
by which said adhesive (26;38;52;100) adheres to said side strip on which 

it is preferentially adhered is greater than the cohesive 
force within the adhesive (26;38;52;100), which force is, in turn, greater 

than the force by which the adhesive adheres to the other (20,32a)  
 

side strip, so that said adhesive (26;38;52;100) completely resides on 
said side strip on which it is preferentially adhered when 

said peel seal is broken.

   said peel seal is formed by pressing said side 

strips of said first and second flexible plastic webs (20,22;32b,32a) 
together at an elevated temperature, whereby the force by 

which said adhesive (26;38;52;100) adheres to said side strip of said first 
flexible plastic web (22;32b) is greater than the cohesive force 

within the adhesive (26;38;52;100), which, in turn, is greater than the 
force by which the adhesive (26;38;52;100) adheres to said side strip of 

said second flexible plastic web (20;32a), so that said adhesive (26;38;52;100)
