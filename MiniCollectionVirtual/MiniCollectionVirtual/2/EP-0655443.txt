<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a derivative of azolylmethylcycloalkanol which 
is useful as art active ingredient of antifungal 
compositions. As a process for preparing azolylmethylcycloalkanol 
derivatives, EP 267778, for example, discloses a process 
comprising preparing a methylenecyclopentane derivative 
from a cyclopentanone derivative, epoxidizing the 
methylenecyclopentane derivative to produce an oxirane 
derivative, and reacting the oxirane derivative with an 
azole compound, according to the following reaction 
formula (a). wherein R¹¹ and R²¹ respectively represent hydrogen atom 
or C₁-C₅ alkyl group; X¹ represents halogen atom, C₁-C₅ 
alkyl group, or phenyl group; q represents an integer of 
0 to 2; A represents nitrogen atom or CH group; and M¹¹ 
represents hydrogen atom or alkali metal atom, provided 
that R¹¹ is not hydrogen atom when R²¹ is hydrogen atom. EP 329397 discloses a method for reacting a 
cyclopentanone derivative, sulfonium methylide or 
sulfoxonium methylide, and an alkali metal salt of azole 
compound or an azole compound and a base, in a polar 
solvent containing an amide bond or dimethylsulfoxide, or 
in a mixed solvent of this polar solvent and an alcohol, 
according to the following reaction formula (b); and a 
method for reacting a cyclopentanone derivative and an 
alkali metal salt of azole compound or an azole compound 
and a base, while intermittently adding 
trimethylsulfonium halide or trimethylsulfoxonium halide 
to a solution of these reactant compounds.  wherein R¹² represents hydrogen atom or C₁-C₅ alkyl 
group; R²² represents hydrogen atom or C₁-C₂ alkyl group; 
X² represents halogen atom, C₁-C₄ alkyl group, phenyl 
group, and the like; A represents nitrogen atom or CH 
group; M¹² represents hydrogen atom or alkali metal atom; 
and r represents an integer of 1 to 5. As a method for epoxidation of ketones or aldehydes, 
Tetrahedron Lett., 23, 5283-5286 (1982) describes that 
ketones (acetophenone, 2-acetylfurane, etc.) can be 
epoxidized by a solid-liquid two-phase reaction using 
trimethylsulfonium iodide, potassium hydroxide, 
acetonitrile, and a small amount of water. Further, 
Tetrahedron, 1985, 1259-1266 describes that benzalehyde 
can he epoxidized in the absence of a solvent by 
trimethylsulfonium iodide or trimethylsulfoxonium iodide 
and potassium fluoride/ aluminum oxide. Because it is difficult to achieve a sufficiently 
high yield by these conventionally known methods and,  
 
further, because these methods require
