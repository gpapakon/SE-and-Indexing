<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an apparatus for applying in situ a repair material to a repair zone of an inner wall of a conduit, said apparatus comprising a radially expandable device adapted in use to extend over a predetermined axial length of the conduit to be repaired and over at least a part of the inner circumference of said conduit, said radially expandable device having an outer surface means forming an outer wall of an expandable cavity, means for supplying a pressure medium to said expandable cavity or withdraw said pressure medium from said expandable cavity to either move said outer surface means radially outwardly or to move said outer surface means radially inwardly, and a flexible sheath member separate from said radially expandable device and arranged so as to be capable of forming an outer layer extending along and at least partially circumferentially around said radially expandable device, in use, between said repair material and said outer surface means, and withdrawal means connected to said sheath member adjacent one end whereby said sheath member can be removed from said conduit with at least a portion of the sheath member contacting said repair material everting as the sheath member is moved axially along said conduit and also relates to a method of applying a repair material in situ to a repair zone of an inner wall of a conduit to be repaired.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR USE IN REPAIRING A PIPELINE AND METHOD FOR CARRYING OUT SUCH REPAIRSThis invention relates to apparatus used in the process of refurbishing damaged conduits, pipelines and sewer pipes through the application of a reinforced lining to their inner walls by means of an inflatable form.The refurbishment of cracked, broken or eroded pipelines or sewer pipes through so-called soft lining methods involving the application of a reinforced lining to their inner walls is well known in the art. Two principal methods are employed : the eversion of a tube of thermosetting resin - impreg ,/ ed reinforcement fabric into a section to be reiined from an external position by means of a head of water, and the application of a layer of thermosetting resin - impregnated reinforcement material to the inner walls of a section to be reiined by means of a form inflatable by air or water pressure. In both cases, curing of the thermosetting resin may be accelerated by circulation of hot water, steam through said inflatable form.A shortcoming exists in the second method described in which an inflatable form is employed in that, particularly with repeated use, the external material of the form may develop an affinity for the resins employed in the relining process and may thus bond to the new lining. This renders difficult the stripping and removal of the form after curing of the resins. It is of course possible to provide a separate layer or sheath between the resins and the external surface of the inflatable form to prevent the form being adhered to the resins, however, in the prior art such separate layers have been secured in some way to the inflatable form so that they can be withdrawn from the pipe being repaired. Such layers cannot be left in the pipeline as they may eventually become detached and ultimately form a blockage in the pipeline. On the other hand, if the layer is secured to the inflatable form, it creates the same removal difficulty that existed with the inflatable form without such a layer and therefore only serves to protect the inflatable form. The present invention aims to provide apparatus for the refurbishment of pipelines and sewer pipes through the application of a layer of thermosetting resin - impregnated reinforcement material to their inner walls by means of an 

inflatable form which may be readily and reliably stripped from a refurbished section and which embodies a coaxial duct capable of sustaining a flow of liquid through the form whilst it is in use.According to a first aspect of

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. Apparatus for applying in situ a repair material to a repair zone of an inner wall of a conduit, said apparatus comprising a radially expandable device adapted in use to extend over a predetermined axial length of the conduit to be repaired and over at least a part of the inner circumference of said conduit, said radially expandable device having an outer surface means forming an outer wall of an expandable cavity, means for supplying a pressure medium to said expandable cavity or withdraw said pressure medium from said expandable cavity to either move said outer surface means radially outwardly or to move said outer surface means radially inwardly, and a flexible sheath member separate from said radially expandable device and arranged so as to be capable of forming an outer layer extending along and at least partially circumferentially around said radially expandable device, in use, between said repair material and said outer surface means, and withdrawal means connected to said sheath member adjacent one end whereby said sheath member can be removed from said conduit with at least a portion of the sheath member contacting said repair material everting as the sheath member is moved axially along said conduit.
2. Apparatus according to Claim 1 wherein said outer surface means of the radially expandable device extends circumferentially around said device, said sheath means being formed as a tube separate from said radially expandable device.
3. Apparatus according to Claim 2 wherein said tube includes at least one circumferential fold with only an outer surface part of said tube being arranged to contact said repair material.
4. Apparatus according to anyone of Claims 1 to 3 wherein said radially expandable device includes a core member. 


5. Apparatus according to Claim 4 wherein said core member extends axially between opposed axial ends of the radially expandable device, said core member having a central through flow passage to maintain flow in said conduit during a repair operation.
6. Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein said radially expandable device includes positioning means for locating said device at said repair zone and removal means for removing said device from said conduit.
7. Apparatus according to Claim 6 wherein said withdrawal means connected to said sheath member forms part of said removal means.
8. Apparatus according to Claim 6 wherein said withdrawal means connected to said sheath member is operable independently of said removal means.
9. A method of applying a repair material in situ to a repair zone of an inner wall of a conduit to be repaired, said process comprising; providing a radially expandable device adapted in use to extend over a predetermined axial length of the conduit to be repaired and over at least part of the inner circumference of said conduit, said radially expandable device having an outer surface means forming an outer wall of an expandable cavity, means for supplying a pressure medium to said expandable cavity to withdraw said pressure medium from said expandable cavity; providing a flexible sheath member, separate from said radially expandable device, over said outer surface means with withdrawal means enabling withdrawal of said sheath member from the conduit; providing a structural repair material outwardly of said sheath member; moving said radially expandable device with said sheath member and repair material into said conduit to be repaired and thereby positioning said repair material adjacent the repair zone; 



 introducing a pressure medium to said expandable cavity to move said outer surface means radially outwardly to press said repair material against said repair zone; subsequently withdrawing said pressure medium from said expandable cavity to move said outer surface radially inwardly; and withdrawing said radially expandable device from said conduit, said flexible sheath member being removed from said conduit either simultaneously with said radially expandable device or separately therefrom with at least a portion of said sheath member contacting the repair material everting as the sheath member is moved axially along said conduit during removal.
