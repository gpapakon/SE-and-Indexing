<ABSTRACT>
A three cylinder internal combustion engine (1) 
comprising an auxiliary or complementary 

cylinder (6), positioned between the two working 
cylinders (5), with a larger diameter and a crank 

pin (14), set at a 180° angle to the other two and 
with the feeding and exhaust operations of the 

lateral working cylinders (5) carried out through the 
central auxiliary or complementary cylinder (6) using 

a duct (18) between the auxiliary cylinder and each 
working cylinder wherein the auxiliary cylinder (6) 

works to a two stroke cycle and the working 
cylinders (5) work to a four stroke cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an internal 
combustion engine with two in line cylinders 
provided with a third cylinder which works as a 
balancing cylinder and as a silencer. An engine of this type is described in the 
Italian patent n° 1224473 from the same 
applicant, wherein a two cylinder engine, with a 
third interposed balancing and complementary 
cylinder of preferably larger diameter than the 
other two, is claimed. The third cylinder, apart from being used as a 
balance against the alternating mass flows, also 
serves as a compressor during delivery strokes 
and as an expansion chamber during return 
strokes, and furthermore as a silencer and as a 
heat exchanger to reduce emissions. The two end 
cranks of the driving shaft are parallel and 
therefore set at a 360° angle, meanwhile the 
crank of the intermediate cylinder is set at a 
180° angle. The feeding to the working cylinders, 
since ignition and combustion occur in them, is 
carried out for each by means of a duct regulated 
by one or more valves which is connected to the 
chamber of the central cylinder, while discharge  
 
outwards from the central cylinder is also 
regulated by one or more valves. An engine of this type is particularly 
suitable for use in small city motor vehicles 
which must be highly compact, economical, 
powerful and silent and which, at the same time, 
must respect strict emission levels. The aim of this invention is to improve the 
features of the engine described above by 
realizing a motor with more power and lower 
emissions but with substantially the same 
dimensions as the above. Said aim is reached by means of an engine of 
said type characterized in that the feeding and 
the discharge of the lateral working cylinders 
take place through the central auxiliary or 
complementary cylinder, with at least one 
connecting duct between said auxiliary cylinder 
and each lateral working cylinder and 
characterized in that the auxiliary or 
complementary cylinder works to a two stroke 
cycle and the lateral working cylinders work on a 
four stroke cycle. Furthermore all three of said cylinders are 
used as pumps to feed, through their block, a  
 
corresponding pressurized air plenum chamber, 
since at every stroke of the piston towards the 
bottom dead centre, a volume of air about double 
the volume moved by each piston is sent to the 
pressurized storage chamber. Further features and advantages are made clear 
by the following description which refers to the 
enclosed drawings supplied by way of example 
only, in

in that for the air intake, the cylinder block is 
connected to the exterior through one or more 

nonreturn valves. 
An engine according to claims 1 and 2 
characterized in that the auxiliary cylinder is 

connected to the pressurized air chamber by means 
of at least one duct and at least one inlet port 

opened in the cylinder wall corresponding to the 
bottom dead point of the piston stroke.
