<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the hydrometallurgical treatment of used domestic and appliance batteries for the recovery of the, particularly metal-containing, raw materials, in which the fine powder formed by comminution of the batteries and removal of residue materials is digested by means of an acid and at least a large part of the constituents of the powder are thus brought into solution, and in which, after at least one further process step, the metal-containing raw material is recovered from the selectively isolated metal salt solution containing only one metal as main constituent. In order to recover and utilise (valorise) the process products, i.e. the metals present in the acid-containing metal salt solution, as chemical feedstocks without high capital and operating costs, the metal is isolated from the metal salt solution as chemical feedstock, for example as carbonate, hydroxide and/or oxyhydrate, concentrated metal solution and/or metal salt.
