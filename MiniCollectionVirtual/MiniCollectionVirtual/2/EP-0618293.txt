<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cell adhesion molecules and nucleic acid sequences 
which code for cell adhesion molecules. In particular, the invention pertains to human cell 
adhesion molecules and nucleic acid sequences which code therefor. Adhesion between cells plays an essential role in development and maintenance of 
tissue form and function. Intercellular adhesion is mediated by a class of adhesive cell surface 
proteins commonly referred to as "cell adhesion molecules" or "CAMs". These proteins have 
been identified and characterized in a phylogenetically diverse range of organisms and have 
been found in many cases to be highly conserved in structure. Certain cell surface CAMs are 
members of a superfamily of glycoproteins which are structurally related to immunoglobulins, 
i.e., their structure contains a number of extracellular immunoglobulin-like 
and fibronectin 
Type III-like domains. The immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs includes the neural cell adhesion molecule 
(N-CAM), the L1 antigen, Ng-CAM, TAG-1, and others. These CAMs are believed to 
mediate homophilic binding between cells and have also recently been recognized as 
participants in heterophilic interactions with other cell surface molecules, extracellular matrix 
proteins and proteoglycans. Many are also believed to be involved in transmission of signals 
to the interior of the cell which modulate cell morphology, cell metabolism and cell adhesion. 
The means by which these molecules transmit signals to the interior of the cell is unclear. The F11 antigen (F11) is a chicken neural cell surface-associated glycoprotein which is 
believed to be involved in neurite-neurite interactions. The cDNA sequence of F11 has been 
determined and it codes for a 1010 amino acid protein (Br√ºmmendorf, et al. (1989) Neuron 
2:1351-1361). The F11 molecule comprises six domains related to the immunoglobulin  
 
domain type C and four domains similar to the fibronectin Type III repeat. These structures 
are also present in L1 and N-CAM. The cDNA sequence of F11 was found to be almost 
identical to the cDNA sequence of the chicken neural glycoprotein contactin (Ranscht, et al. 
(1988) J. Cell Biol. 107:1561-1573; Zisch, et al. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 119:203-213) 
and it is 
now believed that the molecules are the same (contactin/F11). However, prior to Applicants' 
invention, the identity was not clear. A mouse neural cell surface protein, F3, has been 
identified and is the homologue of the chicken neuronal cell adhesion protein contactin/F11.
