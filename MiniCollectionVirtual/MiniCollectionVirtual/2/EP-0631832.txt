<ABSTRACT>
A casting apparatus has, within a heating chamber (6) a casting mould (5) which can be moved out of the said chamber into a cooling melt (10) arranged beneath it. As thermal insulation between the heating chamber (6) and the cooling melt (10), a thermal insulating layer (13) which floats on the cooling melt (10) is provided and the casting mould (5) plunges through this layer into the cooling melt (10).

A method for directional solidification of a molten
metal, for example nickel, poured into a mould, by moving

the mould out of a heating chamber and immersing the mould
in a liquid metal bath serving as a quenching melt, for

example aluminium, and having a lower melting point than the
molten metal in the mould, characterised in that a floating

heat-insulating layer consisting of a material capable of
flowing is placed on the quenching melt to provide a seal

between the heating chamber and the mould and, before the
mould penetrates the heat-insulating layer and dips into the

quenching melt, the heating chamber or the quenching melt is
moved to the extent that the heating chamber touches the

heat-insulating layer or dips into it.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that
solids are used to form the heat-insulating layer which have

a surface which is not wettable by the quenching melt.
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that
granules of graphite, ceramics or aluminium oxide with a

coating which prevents wetting are used to form the heat-insulating
layer.
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that
boron nitrite is used as the coating.
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that
uncoated solids of boron nitrite are used.
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that
beads of SiAlO
2
N are used as the solids.
A method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metallurgical properties 

of the castings are influenced by varying the thickness of
the heat-insulating layer.
A method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a mould without a cooling

plate is used.
A casting apparatus for carrying out the method according
to at least one of the preceding claims, comprising, inside

a heating chamber (6), a mould (5) which may be displaced
out of said heating chamber (6) into a crucible (8) arranged

therebelow and containing a quenching melt (10), wherein
heat insulation is provided on the bottom of the heating

chamber (6) to restrict heat loss between the mould (5) and
the heating chamber (6), characterised in that the heat

insulation is a heat-insulating layer (13) of a flowable
material floating on the quenching melt (10) and extending

at least as far as the bottom edge of the heating chamber.
A casting apparatus according to claim 5, characterised
in that the mould (5) is supported from above on a lowerable

holding frame (3) which encloses the heating chamber (6)
from below and is designed to be lowered for the purpose of

immersion into the crucible (8) containing the quenching
melt (10).
A casting apparatus according to claim 10, characterised
in that the crucible (8) containing the quenching melt (10)

is disposed within a vertically displaceable lifting chamber
(1), which carries the holding frame (3) at its top.
A casting apparatus according to claim 11, characterised
in that the crucible (8) is likewise disposed for vertical

movement relative to this lifting chamber (1).
A casting apparatus according to claim 12, characterised
in that the crucible (8) is arranged on a beam (9) extending 

through a slot (11) into the lifting chamber (1), which beam
(9) is arranged so as to be vertically displaceable by means

of a vertical guide (12) constructed as a spindle drive.
A casting apparatus according to claim 12, characterised
in that the crucible (8) is disposed on a beam (19) of a

vertically displaceable carriage (18) on a guide column (17)
and the carriage (18) is arranged so as to be vertically

displaceable by means of the cable (22) of a cable winch
(21) having a crank handle (20) disposed outside a vacuum

chamber (14) of the casting apparatus.
A casting apparatus according to claim 9 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the crucible (8)

for the quenching melt (10) has a side chamber (25)
separated from the crucible part containing the quenching

melt (10) by a spillway (24) determining the maximum filling
level.
