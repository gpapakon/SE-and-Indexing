<ABSTRACT>
Liquid crystal is confined between two transparent 
substrates (16,17). Pixel electrodes (13) are formed on the 

inner surface of the transparent substrate (17) in the form 
of a matrix while a common electrode (12) is formed on the 

inner surface of the transparent substrate (16). Each pixel 
electrode (13) is divided into subpixel electrodes (13₁,13₂). 

The subpixel electrode (13₁) is connected to the drain of a 
thin film transistor (21) formed adjacent the subpixel 

electrode to apply driving voltage to the electrode. The 
subpixel electrode (13₂) is supplied with capacitance-divided 

driving voltage through a capacitor comprising the 
electrode (13₁) and a control capacitor (15) connected thereto 

with an insulation layer (14) interposed therebetween. Each 
of the subpixel electrodes (13₁,13₂) are divided into two 

domains on which are formed alignment layers (41a,41b,42a,42b), 
in opposition to which alignment layers (43a,43b,44a,44b) 

are formed on the common electrode (12). One 
of the opposed alignment layers is adapted to impart to 

the liquid crystal a pretilt angle greater than the other 
alignment layer is. One of the adjacent orientating films 

in the same plane is adapted to impart to the liquid crystal 
a pretilt angle greater than the other orientating film is.

This invention pertains to a gray scale liquid crystal
(LC) display panel having pixel electrodes each being
divided into a plurality of subpixel electrodes in which
the driving voltage as applied to each pixel electrode is
distributed to the associated subpixel electrodes at
ratios different from each other so that viewing angle may
be widened.U. S. Patent 4,840,460 (which belongs to the same patent family as EP 316 708 A)
discloses a liquid crystal
display (LCD) panel typical of the prior art display panel
of the type discussed herein. In this patent, as shown in
Figs. 1A and 1B illustrating plan and cross-sectional
views, respectively, each of the pixel electrodes 13 facing
a common electrode 12 with a liquid crystal layer 11
interposed therebetween is divided into a plurality of
(four in the illustration) subpixel electrodes 131 - 134
having equal surface areas. Disposed in facing relation
with the divided subpixel electrodes 131 - 134 are
corresponding control capacitor electrodes 151 - 154 having
different surface areas, the control capacitor electrodes
being separated from the subpixel electrodes by an
insulation layer or dielectric layer 14. All the control
capacitor electrodes 151 - 154 in each display pixel are
electrically connected with each other.More specifically, the common electrode 12 is disposed

the control capacitor electrodes 151 - 154 are formed on
the inner surface of a second transparent substrate 17
disposed in spaced opposing relation with the first 
transparent substrate 16. Disposed on those control
capacitor electrodes 151 - 154 is the insulation layer 14
on which the subpixel electrodes 131 - 134 are formed.The pixel electrodes 13 are arrayed in the form of a
matrix on the inner side of the transparent substrate 17.

of pixel electrodes 13 on the inner side of the transparent
substrate 17 while a gate bus 19 is provided along each row
of the array of pixel electrodes 13 on the insulation layer
14.Formed in the vicinity of the intersection between each
source bus 18 and the associated gate bus 19 is a thin film
transistor 21 which comprises a source electrode 22 and a
drain electrode 23 both formed on the inner side of the
transparent substrate 17, a semiconductor layer 24 of such
as amorphous silicon formed between the source and drain
electrodes 22, 23, and a gate electrode 26 disposed on the
semiconductor layer 24 with a gate insulating film 25
