<ABSTRACT>
Liquid organosilicon compounds containing at least 
one alkenyl radical per molecule are included as an 

ingredient of moisture curable organosiloxane compositions 
containing a liquid polydiorganosiloxane with alkoxysilalkylene 

terminal units and an organotitanium compound as 
the curing catalyst. The organosilicon compound reacts with 

silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms present in said composition, 
thereby preventing the generation of hydrogen during storage 

and/or curing of the composition. One source of silicon 
bonded hydrogen is one of the reactants used to prepare the 

polydiorganosiloxane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to moisture curable organosiloxane 
coating compositions. More particularly, this 
invention relates to organosiloxane coating compositions 
that contain no solvents or reactive diluents and are 
sufficiently low in viscosity for application by 
conventional coating techniques. The compositions cure 
rapidly to durable elastomeric coatings exhibiting excellent 
adhesion to a variety of substrates without generating 
hydrogen gas during storage or curing. Conformal coatings containing polyorganosiloxanes 
are known in the art and are useful as protective coatings 
for electronic components and circuit boards on which these 
components are mounted. Representatives of the prior art 
are CA-A 2,028,350; US-A 4,568,566; US-A 4,528,081; US-A 
4,824,875; US-A 4,956,221; US-A 5,082,894 and US-A 
5,008,301. We have found that when one or more of the curable 
polyorganosiloxanes are prepared as described in US-A 
4,772,675 and are used as the curable ingredient of a 
coating composition, without substantial amounts of 
inorganic reinforcing fillers such as silica, hydrogen gas 
was evolved during curing and/or storage of the composition. Because the curable composition is packaged in a 
closed container to avoid contact with atmospheric moisture 
and premature curing, the increase in pressure resulting 
from generation of a gas in this confined area can result in 
swelling or bursting of the container in addition to the 
potential for explosion associated with hydrogen gas. Depending upon the viscosity of the curable 
composition and the rate of cure, the generation of hydrogen  
 
gas during curing causes foaming or the presence of voids in 
the final cured material. Either of these is undesirable in 
a coating. It is therefore an objective of the present 
invention to provide coating compositions that do not 
contain solvents or reactive diluents, are sufficiently low 
in viscosity to be applied rapidly using conventional 
coating techniques such as brushing and spraying, can be 
stored for extended periods of time without any substantial 
decrease in cure rate or hydrogen generation and develop a 
tack- and void-free surface in a sufficiently short time to 
permit subsequent processing of the coated substrate with 
only minimal delays. The objectives of this invention are achieved by 
including a liquid organosilicon compound containing at 
least one alkenyl radical per molecule in moisture curable 
organosiloxane compositions containing a polydiorganosiloxane 
with alkoxysilalkylene
