<DESCRIPTION>
 RECYCLED FIBRE REINFORCED RESIN CONTAINING PRODUCT AND METHOD AND APPARATUS THEREFOR TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to a recycled fibre reinforced resin containing product, in particular to a product containing a substantial proportion of recycled waste fibre reinforced resin product, and to a method of forming such products, and to apparatus for forming such products. BACKGROUND ART Glass fibre reinforced resin products are in wide use for many purposes. This form of synthetic plastic material is attractive from many points of view. It may be fabricated into attractive intricate shapes. It may be moulded in very large shapes. It has great inherent strength and durability, and is weather resistant. The uses of this type of fibre reinforced resin (FRP) products are too numerous to even mention. It is however well known that like many other manufacturing processes, it produces a significant degree of waste material, or reject articles. Waste material is produced in almost every case, by marginal portions or fringes of the material which extend around the edges of the mould and must be trimmed away. Some moulded articles are imperfect and must be rejected. Articles even of FRP, eventually are likely to wear out or become discarded.In addition to all of these problems, the manufacture of the resins and of the glass fibre also results in wastage. The resins must be formulated strictly in accordance with specified formulations. Any quantities of resins which are "off spec" must be rejected as being unsaleable. The same is also true of the glass fibres themselves.The very properties which make FRP an attractive material, also make it a serious problem from the point of view of disposal in an economical and above all ecologically satisfactory manner. Since the FRP material is highly resistant to weathering, if any quantities of it 

are placed in a dump it will remain, there for many years, and will be virtually indestructible. Another of the properties of the FRP materials is their resistance to breaking and crushing. As a result, the disposal of waste FRP products presents a handling problem in that it is difficult if not impossible to crush them and compact them to a degree satisfactory for the waste disposal industry.As a result of all of these problems, it is not unusual to find that the cost of disposal of waste FRP products is a significant item in the overall operating cost of the plant, both of the manufacturer of the base product and also the fabricators of the material.At present there exists
