<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic device comprising a prosthesis coated with substantially pure osteogenic protein is disclosed. A method for biologically fixing prosthetic devices in vivo is also disclosed. In this method, a prosthesis is implanted in an individual in contact with a substantially pure osteogenic protein, enhancing the strength of the bond between the prosthesis and the existing bone at the joining site.

<DESCRIPTION>
Regeneration of skeletal tissues is thought to be
regulated by specific protein factors that are naturally
present within bone matrix. When a bone is damaged, these
factors stimulate cells to form new cartilage and bone
tissue which replaces or repairs lost or damaged bone.
Regeneration of bone is particularly important where
prosthetic implants are used without bonding cement to
replace diseased bone, as in hip replacement. In these
cases, formation of a tight bond between the prosthesis and
the existing bone is very important, and successful function
depends on the interaction between the implant and the bone
tissue at the interface.Bone healing can be stimulated by one or more osteogenic
proteins which can induce a developmental cascade of
cellular events resulting in endochondral bone formation.
Proteins stimulating bone growth have been referred to in
the literature as bone morphogenic proteins, bone inductive
proteins, osteogenic proteins, osteogenin or osteoinductive
proteins.U.S. 4,968,590 (November 6, 1990) discloses the
purification of "substantially pure" osteogenic protein from
bone, capable of inducing endochondral bone formation in a
mammal when implanted in the mammal in association with a
matrix, and having a half maximum activity of at least about
25 to 50 nanograms per 25 milligrams of implanted matrix.
Higher activity subsequently has been shown for this
protein, e.g., 0.8-1.0 ng of osteogenic protein per mg of
implant matrix, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,011,691. This
patent also disclosed a consensus DNA sequence probe useful
for identifying genes encoding osteogenic proteins, and a
number of human genes encoding osteogenic proteins
identified using the consensus probe, including a previously
unidentified gene referred to therein as "OP1" (osteogenic
protein-1). The consensus probe also identified DNA 
sequences corresponding to sequences termed BMP-2 Class I
and Class II ("BMP2" and "BMP4" respectively) and BMP3 in
International Appl. No. PCT/US87/01537. The osteogenic
proteins encoded by these sequences are referred to herein
as "CBMP2A," "CBMP2B", and "CBMP3", respectively. U.S.
5,011,691 also defined a consensus "active region" required
for osteogenic activity and described several novel
biosynthetic constructs using this consensus sequence which
were capable of inducing cartilage or bone formation in a
mammal in association with a matrix.These and other researchers have stated that successful
implantation of the osteogenic factors for endochondral bone
formation requires that
