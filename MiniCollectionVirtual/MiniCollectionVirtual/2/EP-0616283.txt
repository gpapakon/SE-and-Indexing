<ABSTRACT>
Data selectors (217) select values which affect display of data. The data 
selector represents a set of values, and selection is done by interactively "painting" a 

portion of the data selector. The values which correspond to the painted portion are 
activated. Species of the data selectors include discrete data selectors, continuous 

data selectors, and multidimensional data selectors. An exemplary discrete data 
selector is employed in apparatus for displaying information about a very large 

number of entities. The apparatus includes very small entity representations (207) 
representing entities such as lines of text contained in columns (205) representing a 

context such as the files which contain the lines. The discrete data selector 
represents the values of an attribute of the entities. Painting the discrete data selector 

activates the entity representations having the corresponding values. A code viewer 
(button 227) permits detailed views of information about the entity represented by a 

selected entity representation. There are further animated display modes and 
techniques for remapping colors onto the selector fields. Applications of the 

apparatus include testing and maintenance of software and selection of programs in 
interactive TV systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.S.N. 08/032342, filed March 
16, 1993, titled INFORMATION DISPLAY APPARATUS AND METHODS, which is 
in turn a continuation-in-part of U.S.S.N. 07/802,912 which has the same title and 
which was filed December 6, 1991. Both parent applications have the same inventor 
and assignee as the present application. The present application contains the 
complete Detailed Description and Figures from U.S.S.N. 07/902/912 and all of the 
additional disclosure and Figures from U.S.S.N 08/032342. The invention concerns the display of information in a digital computer 
system and more particularly concerns the selective display of information. Modern computer systems have the power required to drive large. high. 
resolution color or black-and-white displays. The high resolution, together with the 
use of colors and/or gray scales, permit the presentation of an enormous amount of 
information in such displays. For instance, the information display apparatus 
disclosed in the parents of the present application can display representations of up 
to 50,000 lines of code and can employ the color, shape, and behavior of the 
representations to convey information about individual lines of code. While the capability of displaying such large amounts of information is 
useful in itself, it is made even more useful if the display includes data selectors 
which permit the user to easily define and display useful subsets of the information. 
One kind of data selector which has long been employed to do this is the slider. A 
slider is a control on a visual display which permits the user to select one or two 
values by means of a pointing device such as a mouse. The selected values then 
determine the behavior of some aspect of the display. FIG. 23 shows a number of 
prior-art sliders. In its simplest form, a slider 2301 consists of a bar 2303 and a 
position marker 2305. The postion marker can be moved along bar 2305 by means 
of the pointing device. The position of marker 2305 indicates the value of a variable 
and that value is used to control the display. A slider may additionally include a 
scale 2307 to give the user an idea of the relationship between the postion of marker 
2305 and the value of the variable. Slider 2309, for example, is a scroll bar for an  
 
editing window in a graphical user interface. The bar represents an entire text being 
edited, and the postion marker indicates a line in the text. The line specified by the 
position marker together with some
