<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE ARTHROPODICIDAL TETRAHYDROPYRIMIDINES The arthropodicidal tetrahydropyrimidines of this invention are characterized by a methyl-substituted alkylene bridge. U.S. 4,831,036 discloses tetrahydropyrimidines not so characterized.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to compounds of Formula I, including all geometric and stereoisomers, agriculturally suitable salts thereof, agricultural compositions containing them and their use to control arthropods in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments. The compounds are:wherein:R1 is selected from the group CH3SCH2CH2-,R2 is selected from the group H; Cj-C o alkyl optionally substituted with1 or 2 substituents independently selected from the group CN.
