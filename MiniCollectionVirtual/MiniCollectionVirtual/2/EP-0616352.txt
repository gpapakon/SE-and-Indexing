<ABSTRACT>
An electrical apparatus switch (1) contains a switching rocker (3), which is mounted in an insulating housing (2), for switching on and off manually (for manual connection and disconnection). By means of an operating end (16) which enters into the housing interior (11), the switching rocker (3) moves a contact link (4) (depending on the pivoting position) between its contact closed position and contact open position. The contact link (4) is electrically connected in series with a contact spring (5) which can be released thermally and thus acts as overcurrent protection. The contact spring (5) can move between its contact position and its open position. The contact spring (5) is mechanically prestressed in the direction of its open position. In the event of an overcurrent, it is moved from its contact position into its open position by means of a thermal tripping element. It is returned from its open position into its contact position again by pivoting the switching rocker against the mechanical prestressing in the rocking direction (66) of the contact spring (5).
