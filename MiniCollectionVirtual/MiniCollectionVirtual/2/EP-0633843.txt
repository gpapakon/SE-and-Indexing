<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle sun visor 
comprising a plate in the form of an oblong plastic body with a surface 
coating (See e.g. DE-A-2 102 917 or JP-A-95936/88). For safety reasons, sun visors for modern cars comprise either 
a plate of a relatively soft material, such as foamed plastic, 
or a hollow plate of a non-foamed plastic. This imparts 
compressibility to the visors so that they are able to absorb 
a blow from a vehicle occupant in the event of a collision or 
under heavy braking. In both cases, the plate is usually covered with a plastic film 
which serves to give the sun visor an aesthetically pleasing 
appearance adapted to the interior of the car. A generally 
employed method for applying the film to the plate comprises 
applying a film sheet to either side of the plate, welding the 
film sheets together around the edges of the plate and trimming 
away the film material outside of the weld line to remove 
surplus film. Sun visors are manufactured in very large numbers and it is 
therefore important to automate the manufacturing process to as 
great a degree as possible in order to keep down the costs. The 
application of the film is however difficult to carry out 
entirely without manual assistance. It is the object of the present invention to provide a sun 
visor comprising a plate in the form of a plastic body with, in 
this context, a new surface coating which can be applied in a 
fully automatic manufacturing process. This is achieved in accordance with the invention by means of 
the surface coating being formed of a polymer layer injection  
 
moulded onto the plastic body, said layer providing final shape 
and surface structure of the sun visor. In a preferred embodiment of the invention such a surface 
coating can be formed of a thermoelastic layer. The sun visor according to the invention can be produced by 
injecting a thermoplastic into a mould cavity between two 
mould-halves to form the plastic body, and thereafter injection 
moulding a thermoplastic containing colour pigment to form a 
surface coating on the plastic body. The invention will be described in greater detail with 
reference to embodiments illustrated in the attached drawings 
in which 
Fig. 1 shows an exploded view of a sun visor plate consisting 
of two halves, and Fig. 2 shows a cross-section through the plate in Fig. 1 with 
an enlargement of the circled region. The sun visor plate shown in Fig. 1 consists of first and 
second plate-halves 1, 2 resp. whose opposing facing sides are 
mirror
