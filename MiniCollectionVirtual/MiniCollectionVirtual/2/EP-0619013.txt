<ABSTRACT>
A Coriolis mass flow rate meter for measuring the mass flow rate of material flowing through a conduit. The flow meter includes at least one flow tube (12 and 14) through which the material to be measured passes. The flow tube is vibrated at its natural frequency so that the concurrent flow of material through the vibrating tube produces a displacement of the tube with the magnitude of the displacement being dependent upon the magnitude of the generated Coriolis forces and the mass flow rate of the measured material. The phase of the displacement of the flow tube is measured using optical fiber sensors (170L and 170R) comprising at least one loop of optical fiber which is flexed by the displacement of the flow tube. This flexing of the fiber causes a corresponding change in its optical conductivity and a corresponding change in the intensity of the light transmitted through the fiber from a light signal source (160) to a signal detector (192L and 192R). The modulated light signal received by the optical signal detector is converted to an electrical signal which is processed to generate the mass flow rate and other information for the flowing material. A feedback circuit (201) for the light signal source monitors the average intensity of the light received by the signal detector and controls the drive signal (202) applied to the light source to maintain the average intensity of the light signal received by the detector at a predetermined initial intensity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to structure comprising
and a method of operating a vibrating tube Coriolis
effect meter and, more particularly, to a Coriolis
effect mass flow rate meter using optical fibers as
displacement sensors.Coriolis effect mass flow rate meters are well-known.
One such meter that has gained widespread
commercial acceptance is shown in U.S. Reissue
Patent 31,450 to James E. Smith of November 29, 1983.
As taught by Smith, the flow of a material through an
oscillating conduit produces Coriolis forces which are
perpendicular to both the velocity of the mass moving
through the conduit and the angular velocity vector of
the oscillation of the conduit. The magnitude of the
generated Coriolis forces is related to the material
mass flow rate as a function of the angular velocity
of the mass flowing through the conduit.Coriolis effect flow meters typically use one or
two flow tubes to direct the measured material flow
from a pipe, through the meter tubes and then back to
the pipe. These tubes may be either straight or
curved, or irregular shaped, and they may be mounted 
in the flow line or attached to a substantially rigid
support. The tubes are normally vibrated by an
electromagnetic drive at the natural frequency of the
tube structure including the measured material. The
Coriolis forces resulting from the mass of the
material flow through the vibrating tubes causes a
displacement of portions of the tubes. The
displacement is measured at points on the tubes by
position or velocity sensors. The time differential
At between the movements of the tube elements at
spaced apart locations is used for a determination of
information including the mass flow rate of the
measured material.One step in measuring the generated Coriolis
forces is to track the relative movement of different
portions of the legs of meters having U-shaped tubes.
This is typically done by attaching two
electromagnetic velocity sensors each comprising a
magnet and a pickup coil in opposing relative
positions on the side legs of the flow conduit or
conduits as described in U.S. Patent 4,422,338
entitled, "Method and Apparatus for Mass Flow
Measurements" and issued December 27, 1983, to
James E. Smith. This is also shown in U.S.
Patent 4,491,025 of January 1, 1985, to James E. Smith
and Donald R. Cage. In a parallel dual tube design as
disclosed in the patent to Smith and Cage, a sensing
coil is attached to one of the two flow conduits. A
cooperating magnet mounted to the other flow conduit
is positioned coaxially within the sensing
