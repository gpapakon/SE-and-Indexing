<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating
machine using a refrigerant mainly comprising ammonia, a
working fluid composition comprising a mixture of a refrigerant
and a lubricating oil for use in a heat pump and the
refrigerating machine, and a method for lubricating an
ammonia compressor.Heretofore, Flon has been widely used as a refrigerant
for a refrigerating machine and a heat pump (hereinafter
referred to generically as "the refrigerating machine").
However, when discharged into the atmosphere, the
Flon is accumulated and then decomposed by ultraviolet rays
of the sun to produce chlorine atoms, and these chlorine
atoms destroy the ozone layer having a function to protect
the earth from the intensive ultraviolet rays of the sun.
For this reason, the use of the Flon is getting limited.
In recent years, much attention is thus paid to ammonia as
an alternative refrigerant of the Flon.An ammonia refrigerant does not destroy the environments 
of the earth in contrast to the Flon, and the
refrigeration effect of ammonia is comparable to that of
the Flon, and what is better, ammonia is inexpensive.
However, ammonia is toxic, combustible, and insoluble in a
mineral oil which is used as a lubricating oil for a compressor.
In addition, ammonia has the drawback that its
discharge temperature of the compressor is high. Accordingly,
a refrigerating system which is now utilized is
constituted so as not to bring about inconveniences owing
to these drawbacks.A typical constitution of the refrigerating system
will be described in reference to Fig. 6. Reference numeral
50 is a direct expansion refrigerating system of a
single-step compression type for providing heat of -10°C on
the side of an evaporator and heat of +35°C on the side of
a condenser. The function of this refrigerating system
will be mainly described. An oil-containing ammonia refrigerant
which is compressed by a refrigerant compressor
51 is treated in an oil separator 52 to separate the oil
therefrom, and it is then subjected to heat exchange with a
cooling water 64 in a condenser 53 (taken heat: about
35°C), whereby the ammonia refrigerant is condensed/liquefied
in the condenser 53.The oil liquefied and separated at the time of the
condensation is further separated in an oil reservoir 55
disposed under the bottom of a high-pressure liquid receiver
54, and the ammonia refrigerant is then vaporized under 
reduced pressure through an expansion valve 56. In an
evaporator 57, heat exchange is carried out with blast load
fed by a fan 58 (taken heat:
