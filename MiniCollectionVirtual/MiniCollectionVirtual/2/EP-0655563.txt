<ABSTRACT>
A vibration-proof power take-out device for an 
engine includes resilient support means 3 through which 

the engine is carried on a support 1, and a 
displacement absorbing joint 5 for connecting an output 

shaft 2a of the engine to a power take-out member 6₁, 

6₂. The displacement absorbing joint 5 comprises a 
first joint member 13 for connection to the output 

shaft 1, a second joint member 14 for connection to the 
power take-out member 6₁, 6₂, and a resilient member 

16, 17 for resiliently interconnecting both the joint 
members 13, 14. The second joint member 14 is 

rotatably carried on the support 1 through a bearing 
means 23. Thus, even if the power take-out member 6₁, 

6₂ is disposed near the output shaft 2a, engine 
vibration can be absorbed by the resilient support 

means 3 and the resilient member 16, 17, and the second 
joint member 14 can be fixedly supported by the bearing 

23, thereby effectively preventing the transmission of 
vibration to the power take-out member 6₁, 6₂. The 

first joint member 13 includes a first hub 13h having 
first transmitting fins 13f mounted projecting radially 

outwardly therefrom, and the second joint member 14 
includes a second hub 14h concentrically surrounding 

the first hub 13h and having second transmitting fins 
14f projecting radially outwardly therefrom. An 

intermediate member 15 has a plurality of intermediate 
fins 15f opposed to the first and second fins 13f, 14f 

in a rotational direction. Opposed surfaces of the 
intermediate fins 15f and the first and second fins 

13f, 14f are interconnected through the resilient 
member 16, 17. Notches 18, through which the first 

transmitting fins 13f are passed, are provided in the 
second hub 14h, and a gap is provided between opposed  

 
portions of each notch 18 and the respective first fin 

13f and can be eliminated when the angle of relative 
rotation reaches a given value. Thus, both the joint 

members 13, 14 and the intermediate fins 15f are 
disposed concentrically, and the entire joint can be 

made compact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration-proof
power take-off device for an engine, for driving various
working machines, and particularly, to a vibration-proof
power take-off device including a resilient support member
through which an engine is mounted on a support, and a
power take-off member connected to an output shaft of the
engine through a displacement absorbing joint. The
invention also relates to a displacement absorbing joint
which is particularly, although not exclusively, suitable for
use with such vibration-proof power take-off device.It is already known that when an output shaft of an
engine and a follower member to be driven such as a wheel
are spaced from each other, as is a case in an automobile,
the engine is carried on a support with resilient support
members interposed therebetween, and the output shaft of
the engine is connected through a Cardan shaft to the
follower member, for preventing vibration of the engine from
being transmitted to the support or to the
follower member.However, in an actual case, there is no appropriate
means for preventing the vibration of the engine from being 
transmitted to the power take-off member, if the output
shaft of the engine and the power take-off member are
disposed in proximity to each other.GB-A-705074 discloses a flexible coupling
comprising first and second joint members, and an
intermediate member having transmitting fins. The
first and second joint members have transmitting
projections which are interconnected with the
transmitting fins of the intermediate member though
resilient members.In such a displacement absorbing joint interposed
between the output shaft of the engine or the like and
the power take-off member, it was impossible to prevent
the joint itself from being complicated in structure
and increased in size, in order to effectively absorb a
fluctuation in torque, an eccentric or transverse
misalignment and an angular misalignment generated
during transmission of a rotational torque and to
prevent a noise.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a vibration-proof power take-off
device for an engine, comprising resilient support
means through which the engine is carried on a 
support, and a displacement absorbing joint for connecting
an output shaft of the engine to a power take-off member,
the displacement absorbing joint being comprised of a first
joint member for connection to the output shaft of the
engine, a second joint member for connection to the power
take-off member, and a resilient
