<ABSTRACT>
A differential interference microscope apparatus 
comprises a light source (1), a condenser optical system (2,3,6) for 

condensing beams of light from the light source and 
illuminating an object with the beams of light, an 

objective optical system (8) for converging the beams of light 
from the illuminated object and forming an image (11) of the 

object, a pick-up device (12) for photoelectrically detecting 
the image of the object, and a contrast enhancement (13) 

circuit for enhancing a contrast of the image on the basis 
of an output signal of the image of the object 

photoelectrically detected by the pick-up device (12). A first 
polarizing element (4) and a first birefringent element (5) are 

disposed sequentially from the side of the light source in 
an optical path between the light source and the object. 

The first polarizing element (4) changes the beams of light 
from the light source into predetermined beams of 

polarized light. The first birefringent element (5) separates 
the polarized light into an ordinary ray and an 

extraordinary ray. A second birefringent element (9) and a 
second polarizing element (10) are disposed sequentially from 

the side of the object in an optical path between the 
object and the image. The second birefringent element (9) 

guides the two light beams from the object onto the same 
optical path. The second polarizing element (10) causes the 

two light beams guided onto the same optical path to 
interfere with each other. The shear quantity S between 

the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray satisfies the 
following condition:

 
δ / 20 ≦ S 
<
 δ / 2 
where δ is the resolving power of the objective optical 
system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a differential 
interference microscope apparatus employed for observing, 
e.g., a living specimen. The present invention also 
relates to an observing method using the differential 
interference microscope apparatus. A conventional differential interference microscope 
includes, e.g., a transmitted illumination type of 
microscope as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. This type of 
differential interference microscope is constructed as 
follows. Referring to FIG. 5A, a specimen is Koehler-illuminated 
with a beam of light from a light source S 
through lenses L₁, L₂ and a condenser lens L₃. The 
transmitted light of this specimen M forms a magnified 
image Y via an objective lens L₄. The magnified image Y is 
observed with a naked eye through an eyepiece L in a 
microscope optical system. This microscope optical system 
incorporates differential interference members, i.e., a 
polarizer P, an analyzer A, a Wollaston prism W₁ and a 
Wollaston prism W₂. The Wollaston prism W₁ is disposed in a position of 
entrance pupil of the condenser lens L₃. The Wollaston  
 
prism W₂ is disposed in a position of exit pupil of the 
objective lens L₄. The polarizer P is disposed on this 
side (on the side of the light source S) of the Wollaston 
prism W₁. The analyzer A is disposed in rear (on the side 
of the eyepiece L₅) of the Wollaston prism W₂. The Wollaston prism is, as illustrated in FIG. 6, 
constructed by bonding two pieces of right-angle prisms 
cut out in a state where directions of their optical axes 
are orthogonal to each other. Herein, the directions 
(shown by arrowheads) of one optical axis are set parallel 
to the sheet surface, while the directions (marked with 
(+)) of the other optical axis are set perpendicular to 
the sheet surface. This prism separates a beam of 
incident light into two beams of rectilinear polarized 
light having oscillatory planes orthogonal to each other. 
At this time, the beam of incident light is separated into 
the two beams of polarized light at an angle-of-deviation 
ϑ determined by an apical angle α of the right-angle 
prism. The angle-of-deviation ϑ is given by: ϑ 2(ne - 
n₀) tanα, where ne is the refractive index of the Wollaston 
prism with respect to an extraordinary ray, and n₀ is the 
refractive index of the Wollaston prism with respect to an 
ordinary ray. According to the above construction, as illustrated 
in FIG. 5B, the rectilinear polarized light in the arrowed 
direction is taken out of the light emerging from the 
light source S by
