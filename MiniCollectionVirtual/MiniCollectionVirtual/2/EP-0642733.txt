<ABSTRACT>
In a two-rotor windrower with a chassis (1) which in each case guides a rotor system (8, 8') on both sides and on which each rotor system (8, 8') is pendulously moveable about a first pendulum axis (13) lying approximately parallel to the longitudinal mid-axis (12) of the chassis, the two rotor systems (8, 8') are each additionally pendulously moveable independently of one another about a second pendulum axis (14) extending approximately transversely relative to the longitudinal mid-axis (12), and the rotor systems (8, 8') each have a supporting wheel (17) sensing the level of the ground (19) and controlling the pendulous movement of the rotor system about the second pendulum axis (14).
