<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-cap electrical lamp, in particular a high-voltage halogen-filament lamp which is arranged inside an outer bulb (2) which is provided with a cap (3) usual for general-service tungsten filament lamps. The high-voltage halogen filament lamp is mounted by a lamp carrier (5) which surrounds a pinch end (1a) of the high-voltage halogen filament lamp in a clamping manner and is fixed to the inner wall of the cap sleeve (3a). The lamp carrier (5) is produced from a punched sheet-metal part.
