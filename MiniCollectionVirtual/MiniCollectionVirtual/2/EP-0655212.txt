<ABSTRACT>
An automatic beverage brewing apparatus 
(20) which includes a brew chamber (24) has an inlet 

(34) and an outlet (41) and a water distribution 
system (30) associated therewith, a filter assembly 

(164) being disposed in the brew chamber (24). An 
opening (147) is formed through the filter assembly 

(164) for communicating with the outlet (41) of the 
brew chamber (24). A piston assembly (26) is 

disposed in the brew chamber (24) including a spool 
(58) and a device (28) for controllably moving the 

spool in axial and rotary directions. The spool (58) 
is disposed in the brew chamber (24) with a head 

(122) thereof controllably movable in the inlet (34) 
and a base (125) thereof controllably movable in the 

outlet (41) for controllably opening and plugging the 
inlet (34) and outlet (41). The apparatus is capable 

of producing large quantified of a desired brewed 
beverage, multiple substance dispensers (22) being 

provided to selectively combine a variety of 
substances to produce a desired brewed beverage. 

Heated water is conserved by provided a control valve 
(82c) on the inlet line (78) at the lower portion of 

the heated water reservoir (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
improved beverage brewing device which automates many 
of the steps involved in a beverage brewing 
operation. Automatic brewing devices are known in the art 
but have not overcome many of the problems associated 
with such devices. For example, U.S. Patent No.  
 
4,633,771 to Anderl shows an automatic brewing device 
which incorporates a movable piston to regulate the 
brewing cycle. The piston as shown in Anderl is axially 
moved by a rod which is driven by a motor. The rod 
advances or retreats based on its engagement with a 
rotating cam disk. A problem arises with the device of 
Anderl in that the notches in the cam disc are prone to 
cause improper brewing if they become coated or clogged 
with foreign matter. Foreign matter is likely to 
accumulate on the disc because of the environment in 
which it operates which includes fines and powder from 
the beverage brewing substance as well as high humidity 
from the brewing process. Another problem with the device as shown in 
Anderl is that it is difficult to keep the brewing 
chamber clean and to exhaust spent brewing substance. 
Anderl shows only a single spray head which proves 
inefficient and is not thorough in flushing spent 
brewing substance from the brew chamber. Another automatic brewing device is shown in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,694,737 to Wittlinger. The device as 
shown in Wittlinger is similar in its operation to the 
device in Anderl but does not provide improvements 
resolving the problems of Anderl. Rather, the device in 
Wittlinger shows improvements to the filtering assembly 
as used in the brew chamber. Another problem with known automatic brewing 
devices is that they are capable of brewing only small 
quantities of beverage. The devices shown in the 
references cited herein indicate brewing small 
quantities of beverage such as a single serving or 
single carafe. The typical arrangement of the structure 
of the brewing apparatus provides space below a 
dispensing spout which is sufficient to accommodate a 
predetermined carafe size. Such a space may also  
 
accommodate a single serving, since a single serving 
container will have dimensions smaller than a multiple 
serving carafe. However, large capacity remote 
reservoirs with one or two gallon capacities are unable 
to receive brewed beverage due to the dimensions of such 
reservoirs which are proportioned to accommodate large 
volumes. It would desirable to provide an automatic 
beverage brewing device which would be capable of 
selectively

A brewing method for breaking a vacuum created in a brewing chamber 
(24) of an automatic beverage brewing apparatus (20) during a rinsing 

cycle, said brewing chamber (24) being positioned in said automatic 
beverage brewing apparatus (20) for brewing and dispensing a brewed 

beverage; a brew line (86) communicating with said brewing chamber 
(24) for delivering heated water to said brewing chamber (24) to infuse a 

brewing substance during a brewing cycle; a rinse line (90) 
communicating with said brewing chamber (24) for delivering unheated 

water to said brewing chamber (24); said brewing chamber (24) being 
rinsed with water from said rinse line (90) after brewing a quantity of 

brewed beverage during a flush cycle; and a control device (32) for 
controllably dispensing selected quantities of water through said brew 

line (86); and characterized in that the method includes the step of 
activating said control device (32) at the end of a flush cycle to 

controllably dispense a predetermined quantity of heated water from said 
brew line (86) into said brewing chamber (24), said quantity of heated 

water being sufficient to increase the temperature in said brewing 
chamber (24) and equalise the pressure reduction occurring therein 

during the flush cycle to break the vacuum created in the brewing 
chamber (24). 
A brewing method for equalizing pressure reduction in a beverage 
brewing apparatus (20), which pressure reduction occurs during removal 

of a spent beverage brewing substance from said apparatus, said 
apparatus (20) including a brewing chamber (24); a brew line (86) 

communicating with said brewing chamber (24) for delivering heated  
 

water to said brewing chamber (24) to infuse a brewing substance 
therein during a brewing cycle; a rinse line (90) communicating with said 

brewing chamber (24) for delivering unheated water to said brewing 
chamber (24) for rinsing said brewing chamber (24) after brewing a 

beverage; said method being characterized by the steps of dispensing a 
quantity of heated water through said brew line (86) for infusing a 

brewing substance during a brewing cycle; flushing the spent beverage 
brewing substance from said brew chamber (24); closing said brewing 

chamber (24) for further rinsing; dispensing a quantity of water through 
said rinse line (90), which water having a temperature which is lower 

than water dispensed through said brew line (86); dispensing a quantity 

of heated water through said brew line (86) to said brewing chamber (24) 
sufficient to increase the temperature of the brewing chamber (24) and 

equalize pressure reduction therein created by flushing said brewing 
chamber (24) with water from said rinse water line (90).
