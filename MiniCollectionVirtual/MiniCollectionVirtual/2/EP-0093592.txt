<ABSTRACT>
Rows of ten filled hypodermic syringes, without rods 
and in depending position, are transferred successively from 

ten-row trays to a rail conveyor by a gang chuck having ten 
expandable inserts which enter and lift the syringes by their 

open piston ends. The syringes are conveyed to like chucks 
on a turret and carried thereby in closely spaced sequence 

through two inspection stations. Ahead of the first station, 
they are spun rapidly and then stopped to leave
 their 
contents spinning for inspection for suspended particles. In 

the second, the syringes are rotated slowly to aid inspection 
for gross defects. Syringes found defective are pulled off 

their chucks manually by the inspectors and dropped to a 
chute for reject syringes. Accepted syringes are transferred 

invertical position from the turret to an angled delivery 
wheel, which tilts them to a horizontal position and delivers 

them to a convevor leading to a rod inserting machine and 
labelling and packaging mechanism.
