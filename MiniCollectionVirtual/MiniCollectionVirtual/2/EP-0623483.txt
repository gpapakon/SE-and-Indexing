Bearing arrangement for stabilizers in motor vehicles, in 
which a plastic bearing made of an elastically deformable 

material is provided in a single-part construction which 
is slit in an axial plane at one side and may be hinged 

open for assembly, which bearing comprises an internal 
bearing surface, which is slidable on the lateral surface 

of the stabilizer (1) and is delimited at the axial ends 
by sealing lip rings (19.1 - 19.4) and in which pockets 

(7) filled with a lubricant are formed between radially 
extending beads (20) and longitudinal ribs (21) extending 

axially therebetween, and which bearing may be assembled 
in a housing (13) with internal prestressing on the 

stabilizer, characterized in that the inner circle 
diameter (DL) of the longitudinal ribs (21) is selected 

so as to be greater than the diameter (DV) of the radial 
beads (20) and at each axial end of the bearing surface a 

plurality of sealing lip rings (19) are provided 
alongside one another, of which the inner and the outer 

sealing lip rings (19.1 and 19.4) are each dimensioned 
with an inside diameter corresponding to the diameter 

(DV) of the radial beads and at least one further sealing 
lip ring (19.2, 19.3) lying between said two sealing lip 

rings has an inside diameter (DL) corresponding to the 
inner circle of the longitudinal ribs (21). 
Plastic bearing according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the inner and outer sealing lip rings (19.1 and 

19.4) are each prestressed to a greater extent than the 
sealing lip rings (19.2 and 19.3) lying therebetween. 
Plastic bearing according to claims 1 to 2, characterized 
in that the limb-forming outsides of the outer sealing 

lip rings (19.1 and 19.4) are each at an angle of 
virtually 90Â° to the horizontal and the inner limb of 

said sealing lip rings extends at a comparatively much 
smaller angle to the sealing lip edge.
