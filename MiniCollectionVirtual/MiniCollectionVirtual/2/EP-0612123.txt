<ABSTRACT>
A programmable input-output electrical connector 
(10) is provided for electrically coupling a plurality of 

conductors (14, 16) with an electronic component (18) 
having a plurality of circuits. The connector includes a 

dielectric housing (12). A programming multi-contact bus 
(60, 80) is mounted in the housing. The bus includes a 

plurality of spring contacts (62, 82) normally biased into 
engagement with respective circuits on the electronic 

component. The spring contacts are individually 
selectively movable to inoperative positions out of 

engagement with the circuits. Latch devices (68, 86a) are 
operatively associated with the spring contacts for 

positively holding each spring contact individually in its 
inoperative position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input-output electrical 
connector for electrically coupling a plurality of 
conductors with an electronic component or device, according 
to the preamble of claim 1. 
Such a connector is known from US-A- 5 125 846. For the 
inoperative positions, the spring contacts must be depressed 
to such extend that they are permamently deformed. This can 
be disadvantageous. 
There are many applications in the electronic industry, such 
as in copying machines, computers and the like, wherein a 
plurality of conductors must be terminated to various 
electronic components to carry out various functions of a 
machine or apparatus. For instance, in a copying machine, 
control electronics are fed through data conductors or lines 
and power conductors or lines to various devices, such as 
motors, audible or visual indicators, or the like which 
perform the various functions of the machine, such as 
changing the reduction of the copying process, varying the 
numbers of copies, rendering audible or visual signals, and 
the like. Electronic components or devices, such as printed 
circuit boards, integrated circuit chips, headers or 
connectors must be coupled through electrical connectors to 
the power and data transmission conductors or lines. Some such electronic systems of the character described 
above include a programming means for an integrated circuit 
chip (IC chip) incorporated in the system. Specifically, as 
stated above, an electrical connector may be designed to 
coupled data transmission lines or conductors to a printed 
circuit board. Conventional circuit traces on the board 
interconnect with the IC chip. A programmable bus or strip 
may be provided to program the IC chip to whatever  
 
electronic configuration is in the machine or other device. 
In essence, the programmable strip tells the IC chip to 
perform various electronic functions by selectively shorting 
out circuit traces on the printed circuit board. In this 
manner, ageneric IC chip can be provided and simply 
programmed within the assembly. Heretofore, such programmable buses or strips most often 
have included individual spring contacts which are 
selectively bent downward, or broken away so that they do 
not engage particular circuit traces on the printed circuit 
board and, thereby, selectively short out the circuit 
traces. Bending the spring contacts to shorting positions 
often has not proven effective. Breaking away selective 
spring contacts often leave undesirable edges, require 
tedious

A programmable input-output electrical connector (10) 
for electrically coupling a plurality of conductors (14, 

16), with an electronic component (18) having a 
plurality of circuits, the connector comprising a 

dielectric housing (12) and 

a programming multi-contact bus (60, 80) mounted in the 
housing,

normally biased into engagement with respective circuits 

on the electronic component (18), the spring contacts 
(62, 82) being individually selectively movable to 

inoperative positions out of engagement with the 
circuits, 
 
characterized in that said spring contacts (62,82) 

include latch projections (68) designed to engage the 
walls of the housing (12) for positively holding each 

spring contact (62) individually in its inoperative 
position and
 
in that a complementary interengaging latch groove (70) 

is provided in these walls of the connector housing 
(12). 
The programmable input-output electrical connector 
as set forth in claim 1, wherein said dielectric housing 

(12) is fabricated of plastic material, and each latch 
projection (68) includes at least one barb on the 

respective spring contact for skiving into the housing 
(12) into latched engagement therewith.
