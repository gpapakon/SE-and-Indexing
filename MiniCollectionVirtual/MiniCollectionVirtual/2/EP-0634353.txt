Door locking equipment for the subsequent installation at the automatic sliding door
of a lift cage, which sliding door is coupled at the storey stops with the shaft door by

means of cams (8, 9) at the cage door leaf (10) and entraining members at the shaft door
and opened and closed together therewith, wherein the door locking equipment in the form

of a pawl (1) detenting into a hook catch (2), a transmission means (4, 5, 6) and an
actuating element makes an opening of the sliding door from the interior of the cage

impossible when this is situated either between two storeys or outside the door opening
zone of a storey and the door locking equipment unlatches the sliding door by lifting

the pawl (1) when the cage is situated at a storey, characterised in that a rocker (3), which
is arranged to be movable about a pivot (24, 30) and has a fixed invariable angle between

a tension limb (22, 28) and a pressure limb (23, 29), is provided as actuating element,
wherein the tension limb (22, 28) is operatively connected with the transmission means (4,

5, 6) and the pressure limb (23, 29) co-operates with the entraining members at the shaft
door for the opening of the door at a stop.
Door locking equipment according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure
limb (23, 29) of the rocker (3) has a chamfer (32) at the lower and upper end.
