<ABSTRACT>
In a device (10) for stretching a rectangular gauze material or similar fabric (12) in a printing frame (14), having tensioning devices (16) which are arranged on the sides of said printing frame and in which the fabric is fastened by means of a clamping mouth (18) in each case consisting of clamping jaws (32, 36), which are movable relative to one another and can be positioned one on the other under pressure on the closing path of a closing lever (50), and is subsequently tensioned in the pulling direction by a change in position of the clamping mouth units caused by a piston/cylinder unit for flow medium, a further closing path is disposed after the closing path determined by the closing lever (50), when the clamping jaws (32, 36) are moved together, said further closing path being controlled by a piston rod (72). Additionally, the piston rod (72) is to be part of the piston/cylinder unit for the pulling movement of the tensioning device (16). Assigned to the piston in the cylinder (20) are an open position of the clamping mouth (18) near to the clamping jaws (32, 36), a central position when the clamping jaws are closed, and an adjoining stroke path for the tensioning operation.

Device for stretching a piece of fabric (12), in particular a rectangular gauze 
material, on a print frame (14) with stretching means arranged at the sides thereof, 

in which the piece of fabric (12) is fixed by means of respective clamping jaws (18) 
consisting of jaws (32, 36) which can move relative to one another and can be 

placed one on top of the other under locking pressure during the closing stroke of 
a closing lever (50) and is then stretched in the pulling direction (x) by a change of 

position of the clamping jaw units caused by a cylinder/piston unit (20, 78) for 
flow medium, characterised in that, when the jaws (32, 36) are brought together, a 

further closing stroke follows the first closing stroke defined by the closing lever 
(50), wherein the further closing stroke is controlled by a piston rod (72) of the 

cylinder/piston unit (20, 78) and, in the cylinder (20), the piston rod (72) can 
assume a first open position (I) of the clamping jaws (18) close to the jaws (32, 

36) and, after part of the stroke length (h
1
), a central position (II) when the jaws 
(32, 36) are closed and can execute a subsequent stroke (stroke length i) for the 

stretching process. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a short-stroke cylinder (27) by 
means of which the respective clamping jaws (18) are arranged below the surface 

(13) of the upstream print flame (14) prior to the insertion of the piece of fabric 
(12) and can be closed following the insertion thereof, after which the short-stroke 

cylinder (27) can be actuated and the clamping jaws (18) can be adjusted above the 
surface (13) in order to un
lock a slide (28). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a piston (78) on the piston rod (72), 
the latter being part of the cylinder/piston unit (20, 78) for the pulling movement 

of a stretching means (16). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the clamping jaws 
(18) are held in the gripping position until the release of a locking member (90) for  

 
the slide (28) or the short-stroke cylinder (27), wherein the piston (78) can be 

brought into the central position (II) over part of the stroke length (h
1
). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the cylinder (20) 
ending at one end in a bar-shaped base element (22, 24) is displaceably mounted at 

the other end in a connecting sleeve (54) in which the piston rod (72) is fixed via 
its end (71) remote from the piston (78), the piston rod (72) optionally traversing 

an end wall (75) of the cylinder (20) and the piston rod (72) being movably 
mounted in the sealed through bore (74). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
connecting sleeve (54) is hinged on to a guide element (46) and the latter is 

pivotably connected to a slide (28) which carries the jaws (32, 36) and is mounted 
to move in the pulling direction (x) on a profile (24) forming the base element. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised by a guide element in the 
form of a bow (46), the arms (47) of which embrace the two sides (23) of the 

profile and are connected to the slide (28) by means of an axis of rotation (44). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the bow (46) is 
arranged within a hood-shaped supporting member for the movable jaw (36) 

serving as a tilting body (40) and is connected to the latter on either side by means 
of two toggle links (57, 64) which are hinged on the bow (46) at a distance (n) 

from one another. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the slide 
(28) is provided parallel to the axis of rotation (44) for the bow (46) with a pivot 

axis (42) for the hood-shaped supporting member or the tilting body (40) of the 
movable jaw (36). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that a wrist pin 
(58) forming a joint between one of the toggle links (57) and the tilting body (40) 

is connected to a rocker arm (64) forming another toggle link, the other end of 
which provides an elongated hole (63) for a hinge axis (62) of the bow (46).  

 
Device according to claim 8 or claim 10, characterised in that the hinge axis (62) 
for the rocker arm (64) is arranged so that it can be guided by the arm (47) of the 

bow (46) about its hinge point (56) for the toggle link (57) formed by a guide rod. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the tilting 
body (40) flanks the connecting sleeve (54) via parallel side walls, is hinged on to 

the slide (28) by means of the pivot axis (42) and holds the jaw (36) by means of a 
front edge parallel to the pivot axis (42). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that, firstly, the 
hinge point (52) which connects the connecting sleeve (54) to the arm (47) of the 

bow and, secondly, a hinge point (56) for the guide rod (57) hinged on to the

Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the profile
