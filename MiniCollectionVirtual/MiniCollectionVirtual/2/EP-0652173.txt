<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine for continuously unwinding web material, which is provided with a device (9) for cutting and butt splicing. Machine characterised in that the cutting and butt-splicing device (9) is automatic and in that the removable means (10) for triggering cutting and butt splicing interacts successively, by means of the reflector (14), with an automatic device for controlling the cutting process and then the splicing process and, via the means (13), with the mechanism (11) for triggering cutting and splicing, the said triggering mechanism (11) recovering (retrieving) the removable triggering means (10) before the automatic cycle commences.

Continuous web material unwinding machine provided with 
an automatic cutting and butt splicing device (9) and with an 

automaton for controlling the cutting then splicing procedure, 
said device (9) essentially consisting of a removable means 

(10) for triggering the cutting and butt splicing device (9) 
mounted on the new bobbin to be unwound (4) having the form of 

a feeder provided, on the one hand, on its face turned toward 
the bobbin (4), with fixing points and, on the other hand, 

with a means (13) intended to cooperate with a mechanism (11) 
for triggering the cutting and splicing device (9) and of a 

means (12) for positioning the removable means (10) on the new 
bobbin (4) having the form of a template, resting against the 

flank of bobbin (4) and having a cut-out corresponding to the 
plane section of the removable means (10) and consisting of 

plane plate provided at one end with lugs (25) for support on 
the bobbin, characterised in that said feeder is provided on 

its face opposed to that provided with fixing points with a 
reflector (14), the removable means (10) for triggering the 

cutting and butt splicing device (9) cooperates successively 
via the reflector (14) with the automaton for controlling the 

cutting then splicing procedure and, via said means of 
cooperation (13), with said triggering mechanism (11), said 

triggering mechanism (11) recovering the removable triggering 
means before initiation of the automatic cycle.  

 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
automaton for controlling the cutting and splicing procedure 

on the one hand consists of a programmable automaton 

integrating the instantaneous speeds of rotation of the 
unwinding bobbin and the diameter thereof, by cooperation with 

detectors of the photoelectric or other type and counters of 
the multi-revolution coder or other type and of a 

photoelectric cell (15) mounted on the frame (1) of the 
machine and cooperating with the reflector (14) of the 

removable means (10) for triggering cutting and butt splicing 
and, on the other hand, delivers orders to launch the new 

bobbin and trigger cutting and splicing. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
mechanism (11) for triggering cutting and splicing as well as 

the recovery of the removable triggering means (10) consists 
of a support (16) mounted with the possibility of adjustable 

displacement transversely over the width of the bobbin on a 
shaft (17) and of a lever (18) for triggering the cutting and 

butt splicing device (9) pivotally guided on the support (16) 
and cooperating, in order to hold this device (9) prior to 

cutting and splicing, via a stop (19) with a stop (20) 
integral with a supporting arm (21) of at least one cutting 

blade (22) of the finishing web. 
Machine according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
transverse displacement of the support (16) of the triggering 

mechanism (11) on the shaft (17) is effected by means of a 
jack, this displacement being adjusted in amplitude by means 

of a screw stop or the like arranged on the shaft (17).  
 
Machine according to any one of claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that the support (16) of the triggering 

mechanism (11) has the form of a lever parallel to the lever 
(18) for triggering the cutting and splicing device (9) and is 

provided at its free end with a small wheel (23) extending 
Perpendicularly in front of the support (16) and the lever 

(18) and slightly exceeding the vertical plane of the face 
turned toward the interior of the machine of the lever (18). 
Machine according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the support (16) of the triggering 

mechanism (11) is also provided with a means (24) for recovery 
and holding of said removable means (10) in the form of a 

magnet or the like. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
means (12) for positioning the removable means (10) on the new 

bobbin (4) before initiation of the automatic cycle is 
provided, at the end of the plate forming it, remote from that 

provided with lugs (25), with perforations (26) arranged in a 
rainbow and allowing alignment on the end of the new web to be 

unwound. 
Machine according to claim 3, characterised in that it is 
also provided with a counter-pressure means (27) intended to 

cooperate, for cutting, with the knife or knives (22) of the 
cutting and butt slicing device (9) and mounted so as to rock, 

by means of arms (28), on the plates (2) supporting the 
bobbins (4).
