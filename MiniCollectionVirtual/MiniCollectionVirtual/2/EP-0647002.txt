<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sparking plug cap for 
internal combustion engines. A recent tendency to higher power output of internal 
combustion engines leads to higher electrical voltage applied to 
sparking plugs and higher temperature around the engine. Thus the 
stringent requirement has been made for qualities of sparking plug 
caps, for example, the insulation durability thereof at high 
temperature, further the insulation durability thereof at high 
temperature under high humidity or in the presence of water. Conventional sparking plug caps are made of, for example, 
unsaturated polyesters or polybutylene terephtalate, etc. However, 
the plug caps prepared from such materials cannot meet the above 
stringent requirement. A sparking plug cap using polyphenylene sulfide which is a 
heat resistive polymer is also suggested (see Japanese Utility Model 
Kokai No. 43259/1991). However, it is not sufficient in dielectric 
strength, i.e., insulation durability, at high temperature under high 
humidity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a sparking 
plug cap excellent in insulation durability at high temperature, 
particularly under high humidity or in the presence of water. It has been found that, when a resin selected from the group 
consisting of an alloy of polyphenylene sulfide and polyphenylene 
oxide, polyarylate, polyetherimide and a liquid crystalline polymer is 
used as a material for sparking plug cap, the problem mentioned above 
can be solved. Accordingly, the present invention provides a sparking plug 
cap comprising a resin selected from the group consisting of an alloy 
of polyphenylene sulfide and polyphenylene oxide, polyarylate, 
polyetherimide and a liquid crystalline polymer. Fig. 1 shows a sectional view of a sparking plug cap according 
to the present invention mounted. The sparking plug cap 1 is a 
cylindrical object which covers a high voltage code 2 and a plug 
terminal 3 connected to the end of the high voltage code. An end cap 4 
is fitted to an end of the sparking plug cap and a cap 5 is fitted to the 
base thereof. The end cap 4 and the cap 5 are set to a plug hole 7 in an 
engine block 6. Fig. 2 shows an alternating current dielectric strength tester 
to evaluate the sparking plug cap according to the present invention. The polyphenylene sulfide which is a component of the 
polymer alloy used for the sparking plug is a polymer having the 
repeating units represented by the following formula; 
The polyphenylene oxide which is another component of the
