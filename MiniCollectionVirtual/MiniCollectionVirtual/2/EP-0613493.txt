<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to additive compositions and their use in improving the 
properties of oil and fuel oil compositions. It is known that wax separates out from oils and fuel oils at low temperatures 
thereby impairing certain properties. It is also known to use additives to improve 
those properties, for example to improve cold flow properties and to inhibit 
settling of the wax under gravity on standing. Additives for the former are 
sometimes called Cold Flow Improvers and additives for the latter are sometimes 
called Wax Anti-settling Additives. Examples of patent specifications describing such additives and their use are: 
US Patents 3 048 479; 3 961 916; 3 252 771; 2 542 542; 3 444 082; 
4 211 534; 4 375 973 and 4 402 708; UK Patents 1263152; 1 469 016; 
1 468 588; 2 129 012; 2 923 645; and 1 209 676; Japanese Patent 
Publications 56 54 038; 56 54 037; and 55 40 640. EP-A-0 225 688 describes the use of itaconate and citraconate polymers and 
copolymers for improving the cold flow properties of an oil (crude or lubricating) 
and fuel oils such as residual fuel, middle distillate fuels and jet fuel or as a 
dewaxing aid in lubricating oil, which polymers and copolymers can be tailored 
to suit the particular oil or fuel oil concerned. It describes polymers and 
copolymers having number average molecular weights as measured by Gel 
Permeation Chromatography of from 1,000 to 500,000 and exemplifies polymers 
and copolymers of molecular weights of 20,000 and higher. A problem using, in oils and fuel oils, polymers such as those embraced within 
EP-A-0 225 688 is that they may regress the cold flow performance of flow 
improving additives. The present invention can overcome this regression by 
using certain comb polymers in combination as will be described hereinafter and 
illustrated in the examples herein. International Application Number PCT/GB91/00622 (Publication No 
WO 91/16407) describes the use of polymers embraced within 
EP-A-0 255 688 of number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 20,000 as low 
temperature flow improvers for distillate fuels, such as in combination with other  
 
additives, of which comb polymers are mentioned and esterified copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride specifically 
exemplified. In a first aspect, the invention provides an additive composition comprising, in 
combination, 
(i) a polymer containing the units: 
or 
where x is an integer and y is 0 or an integer and wherein, in the polymer, 
the sum of x and y is at least two, the ratio of units (II) to
