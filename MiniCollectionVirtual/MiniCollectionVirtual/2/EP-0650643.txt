<ABSTRACT>
A card connector (2) according to the current invention provides a substantially low profile when it is placed on the board. Stoppers (8) and solder tails (16) are situated at the bottom of the housing (4) of the card connector and extend in the perpendicular direction with respect to the housing. The connector housing is inserted into a mount opening (22) of a circuit board (20) from a rear side of the circuit board. A portion of the housing may be positioned above the front surface (20a) of the circuit board while stoppers and solder tails are positioned on the rear surface (20b) of the circuit board. Since the solder tails are soldered to the circuit board, it is possible to reduce the height of the connector housing that extends over the front surface of the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector assembly
for connecting circuit boards such as it is, for example, known from FR-A-2 368 852. In particular, the invention relates
to a card connector assembly which has a reduced height or low profile
over a circuit board when it is mounted on the circuit board.In the past, card connectors for connecting a
mother board and a daughter board have been mounted on one
surface of the mother board, with solder tails of the card
connector soldered to solder pads on the same side of the
mother board. Although various electronic component parts
are also mounted on one surface of the mother board, the
connection terminals of the electronic components are
soldered on the other surface of the mother board via holes
in the mother board.Recently there has been growing demand for
automating a soldering step for a board-to-board interconnect
system. In this regard, it is desirable to achieve one step
soldering of a card connector. In the aforementioned mount
method, since the card connector and electronic component
parts are soldered on the opposite sides of the mother board,
the card connector and other electronic components cannot be
soldered with one step.Further, there is also a growing demand for a
board-to-board interconnect system with a connector which
extends only a short distance above the board surface. This 
demand stems, in part, from efforts to scale down or miniaturize electronic components and to
achieve high component density. In the aforementioned mount method, since the card
connector is mounted and soldered on the same surface of the mother board, there is an
undesirable height of the card connector above the surface of the mother board. A need
therefore exists to reduce the height of the card connector, i.e. a low profile connector.In mounting the card connector, it is also necessary to change the existing mount method
and to automate the soldering step.In order to satisfy the aforementioned demands, a connector assembly is provided
according to the present invention whereby it is possible to automate a soldering step during
assembly while ensuring minimal height.According to the present invention there is provided a low-profile electrical connector
assembly comprising a first connector for association with a first substrate or circuit board and
a second connector for association with a second substrate or circuit board, wherein:
the first connector at least includes a plurality of male contact elements each having a
contact portion extending
