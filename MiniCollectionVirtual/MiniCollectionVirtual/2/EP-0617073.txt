<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel silicon-containing
polymer which is useful as a heat-resistant
polymer, a burning-resistant polymer, a conductive polymer and
a material for luminescent elements, non-linear elements as
well as a method for preparing the silicon-containing polymer
and a hardened product of the polymer.Recently, there have intensively and widely been
conducted studies of heat-resistant polymers such as carbon-based
polymers represented by polyimides; and silicon-based
polymers such as silicone and polycarbosilane. The silicon-based
polymers can molecularly been designed easily since they
include bonds of high bonding energy such as Si-O and Si-C or
those having high reactivity such as Si-Cl and Si-H.
Nevertheless, there have only a few studies of heat-resistant
silicon-containing polymers except for silicone. As examples
of polycarbosilanes, silicon-containing polymers having
structures represented by the following structural formula
(6):

(wherein R'' represents a methyl or phenyl group; Ar
represents a divalent aromatic group) have been synthesized 
in the presence of a catalyst such as a Pd catalyst. However,
there have been limitations in the means available for the
synthesis of these silicon-containing polymers having such
structures and starting materials required for the
polymerization thereof and therefore, only a few compounds
have conventionally been synthesized (see, for instance,
Robert J.P. Corriu et al., Journal of Polymer Science: Part C:
Polymer Letters, 1990, 28, pp. 431-437). The inventors of
this invention have taken note of such polymers which carry,
in the main chain, ethynylene groups, aromatic groups and
silylene groups and expected that these polymers exhibit high
heat resistance and high resistance to burning. Since it
would be assumed that physical properties of polymers largely
differ from one another depending on the kinds of substituents
thereof, the inventors have conducted various studies to
develop further improved novel compounds. The inventors have
made effort to develop, in particular, compounds having
structures represented by the foregoing structural formula
(6) in which either or both of the substituents R'' on the
silicon atom are hydrogen atoms since they can converted into
other compounds exhibiting specific physical properties
through, for instance, the crosslinking reaction of Si-H
groups with ethynylene groups. However, it is difficult to
synthesize these compounds according to the method disclosed
in the aforementioned article of R.J.P.
