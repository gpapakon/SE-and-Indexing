<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID MONITORING* DESCRIPTION5 This invention relates to apparatus for and a method of monitoring for the presence of a fluid and is especially, but not exclusively, related to the monitoring of a gas in a dirty environment, such as, a mine or other high particle-contaminated environment.10Such inventive apparatus and method may also be used for the detection and/or qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of a fluid.15 Any fluid exhibits a characteristic light absorption spectrum which can be used to monitor the presence and quantify the amount of the fluid in a given sample. The precise configurations of such absorption spectra vary from fluid to fluid but20 generally consist of both fundamental and derived overtone absorption J-ands. Thus, a choice of wavelength region for a fluid to be monitored is usually available. Additionally, some fluids also exhibit regular comb-like absorption spectra structures25 around their primary absorption lines, examples of such fluids being methane, carbon monoxide and oxygen.A conventional gas monitoring arrangement consists of a light source, wavelength band filter and an 30 appropriate detector plus a gas sample celj. through «, which light from the εojrce is passed.r« If a DC system of monitoring is employed, then a reference beam is required for calibration purposes.35 In a "dirty" environment, such as, a coal mine, there 

is considerable scope for measurement errors, in that it is difficult to ensure that the sample and reference beams are equally affected by any contamination.Also, such known arrangements tend to lack sensitivity and, hence, are not suitable for use in monitoring low level fluid leaks.It is an object of the present invention to provide apparatus for and a method of monitoring for the presence of a fluid which overcome, or at least substantially reduce, the disadvantages associated with the known fluid monitoring arrangements discussed above.Accordingly, one aspect of the invention resides in fluid monitoring apparatus comprising electromagnetic radiation sources arranged to provide respective reference and sample beams of electromagnetic radiation, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation preferably being matched with that of the absorption spectrum of a fluid to be monitored, a first cell which contains a reference sample of the fluid to be monitored and through which the reference beam of electromagnetic radiation is passable, a second cell which is capable of containing a working sample of the fluid to be monitored and through which
