<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat (10) has a lower seat frame (14) and a seat back
(16) pivoted about a recliner axis (20). An occupant (22) restraining shoulder

belt (26) has an upper attachment point provided by a sliding belt guide (40)
fixed to the top of a resilient, flexible elongated tower (36) attached to one

side of the seat back (16). The tower (36) is normally unflexed, with the
same orientation as the seat back (16), but is capable of bending with the belt

guide (40) down and forwardly relative to the seat back and closer to the
recliner axis (20) when a forward and downward force is applied to the belt

guide (40). An inertially locking belt retractor (24) is rigidly fixed to the seat
(10) below the belt guide (40). The retractor (24) provides a reserve length of

belt (50) that extends up along the back of the tower (36) and over the belt
guide (40) and then continues into the shoulder belt (26). In the event of

rapid vehicle deceleration, the belt retractor (24) locks to the belt reserve
length (50) as the occupant (22) moves relatively forward into the shoulder

belt (26), thereby rapidly increasing tension in the shoulder belt (26) and
applying a forward and downward bending force to the upper belt guide (40)

and tower (36). In response, the tower (36) bends over and downwardly,
allowing the belt reserve length (50) to move more horizontally along with the

bending tower (36) as the upper guide (40) and shoulder belt (26) move
forwardly with the occupant. This compound belt motion reduces the

resulting tension load in the shoulder belt (26) considerably, as well as the

moment applied to the seat back (16) about the recliner axis (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle seats in general, and
specifically to a vehicle seat with an integral, "all belts to seat" system.Vehicle occupant restraints, especially those directed to front
seat driver and passenger, have progressed rapidly from a lap belt only design
to a so called "3 point" design, with both a lap belt and a shoulder belt
running diagonally across the occupant from an upper attachment point above
and slightly behind one shoulder to a diagonally opposed lower point. The
other of the three points is simply the other point of attachment for the lap
belt. With conventional three point belt systems, the various points of
attachment have typically been secured to the vehicle body or floor. The
upper point of the shoulder belt, for example, has usually been provided by a
"D ring" fixed to the pillar of the vehicle body. To provide the shoulder belt,
a length of belt pays out from a retractor, up and through the D ring, and then
across the shoulder and chest of the occupant to the lower attachment point
(buckle). The retractor pays out belt under a slight tension as it is being
adjusted and secured by the occupant, providing comfort and a snug fit. The
retractor is also typically an inertially latching design, however, meaning that
in the event of vehicle and occupant deceleration caused by a frontal impact,
the retractor locks fast, letting out only a small, predetermined length of belt
webbing. Thus, the occupants forward motion relative to the vehicle is
restrained by the belt, and the tension load in the belt rises very rapidly. That
belt load is conventionally resisted by vehicle body frame anchoring points,
which are fixed relative to the vehicle by definition. Alternatively, a belt system integrated entirely into the seat
structure would move with the seat as the seat moved relative to the vehicle
body frame, and provide design flexibility. However, the seat frame structure
must then be strong enough itself to resist the heavy belt loads transferred to it
through belt attachment points that are now secured to the seat frame. The
seat back also generally pivots about an axis relative to the lower part of the
seat frame, so that a recliner mechanism can adjust the angle of the seat back.
During frontal impact, when the increased belt load is transferred to the seat
back at the high attachment point, a large moment arm exists relative to the
seat back pivot axis, as well as a moment tending to rotate the lower frame up
from its attachment to the vehicle body floor. All of these

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle seat (10) having a lower seat frame (14) and a
seat back (16) pivoted thereto about an axis (20), and a seat occupant (22)

restrained in the event of rapid deceleration relative to the vehicle by a
shoulder belt (26) with an upper attachment point (40) integral to said seat

back (16) located behind and above a shoulder of said occupant (22) and a
lower attachment point (28) diagonally opposed to said upper attachment point

(40) and integral to said lower seat frame (14), characterized in that said
vehicle seat (10) further comprises,


a resilient, flexible elongated tower (36) having a sliding belt
guide (40) at an upper end comprising said upper attachment point, said tower

(36) being secured to said vehicle so as to have substantially the same
orientation as said seat back (16) in an unflexed condition, but capable of

bending with said belt guide (40) down and forwardly relative to said seat
back and closer to said seat back pivot axis (20) when a forward and

downward force is applied to said belt guide (40), and,
an inertially locking belt retractor (24) rigidly fixed to said seat
(10) below said belt guide (40), said retractor (24) providing a reserve length

of belt (50) that extends up along the back of said tower (36) and over said
belt guide (40) and continuously into said shoulder belt (26),
whereby, in the event of rapid vehicle deceleration, said belt
retractor (24) locks to said belt reserve length (50) as said occupant (22) is

thrown relatively forward into said shoulder belt (26), thereby rapidly
increasing tension in said shoulder belt (26) and applying a forward and

downward bending force to said upper belt guide (40) and tower (36), in
response to which said tower (36) bends over and downwardly, allowing said

belt reserve length (50) to move more horizontally along with said bending
tower (36) as said upper guide (40) and shoulder belt (26) move forwardly

with said occupant, said simultaneous belt reserve length (50) and shoulder
belt (26) motions combining to reduce the resulting tension load in said

shoulder belt (26) and the moment applied to said seat back (16) about said
pivot axis (20).
A vehicle seat (10) according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said tower (36) is comprised of a central, elongated

resilient member (42) covered with an overmolded damping layer (46).
A vehicle seat (10) according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said overmolded damping layer (46) is an elastomeric

material providing strain rate sensitivity.
A vehicle seat (10) according to claim 1 further
characterized in that said tower (36) makes a closed fit within a sleeve (38) on

one side of said seat back (16).
