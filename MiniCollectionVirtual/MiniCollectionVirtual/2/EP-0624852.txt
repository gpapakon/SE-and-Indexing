<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanner module for directing a light beam 
to scan an optically encoded symbol includes an optical 

element (72, 92, 110, 112, 163, 176, 214, 246) mounted 
for oscillatory motion to scan the light beam in one 

direction by a flex element (64, 90, 108, 130, 162, 172, 
212, 250) capable of torsional flexure. This 

oscillatory motion is induced by the interacting magnetic 
fields established by a permanent magnet (74, 112, 94, 

164, 178, 216, 248) mounted to the flex element and an 
electromagnetic coil (52, 82, 158, 160, 174, 204, 224, 

226) driven by an AC current. Bidirectional light beam 
scanning is achieved by mounting an assembly of the flex 

element, optical element and permanent magnet to one or 
more additional flex elements (56, 88, 114, 142, 154, 

180, 230) for oscillatory motion to scan the light beam 
in a second direction. This oscillatory motion may be 

induced by the inclusion of an additional permanent 
magnet and/or electromagnetic coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanning systems
which "read" indicia, for example, barcode symbols,
having parts with different light reflectivities and, in
particular, to a scanner module for directing a beam of
light in a predetermined scanning pattern at a barcode
symbol and directing light reflected from the barcode
symbol to an optical detector. Various optical readers and optical scanning systems have
previously been developed for reading barcode symbols appearing on
a label, or on the surface of an article. The barcode symbol
itself is a coded pattern of indicia. Generally, scanning systems
electro-optically transform the graphic indicia of the symbols
into electrical signals which are decoded into alphanumeric characters.
The resulting characters describe the article and/or some
characteristic of the article to which the symbol is attached.
Such characters typically comprise input data to a data processing
system for applications in point-of-sale processing, inventory
control, and the like.As used in this specification and in the following claims,
the terms "symbol," "barcode," and "barcode symbol" are used to
denote a pattern of variable-width bars separated by variable-width
spaces. The foregoing terms are intended to be broadly
construed to cover many specific forms of one- and two-dimensional
patterns including alphanumeric characters, as well as, bars and
spaces.The specific arrangement of bars or elements in a symbol
defines the character represented according to a set of rules and
definitions specified by the code. This is called the "symbology"
of the code. The relative size of the bars and spaces is
determined by the type of code used, as is the actual size of the
bars and spaces. The number of characters per inch represented by
the barcode symbol is referred to as the density of the symbol. To encode a desired sequence of characters, a collection of
element arrangements are concatenated to form the complete symbol,
with each character being represented by its own corresponding
group of elements. In some symbologies, a unique "start" and
"stop" character is used to indicate where the barcode symbol
begins and ends. A number of different barcode symbologies
presently exist. These symbologies include one-dimensional codes
such as UPC/EAN, Code 39, Code 128, Codabar, and Interleaved 2
of 5.In order to increase the amount of data that can be
represented or stored on a given amount of symbol surface area,
several new symbologies have been developed. One new code
standard, Code 49,
