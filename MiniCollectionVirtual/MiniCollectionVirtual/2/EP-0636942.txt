<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a binder resin for an 
electrophotographic toner and a toner containing the same. In an electrophotography, the method of applying a heat 
roller has been widely used to fix an electrostatic latent image 
visualized with a toner. In applying this method, it is required 
that the lowest fixing temperature of the toner (Tf ; the lowest 
heat roller temperature when 70 % of the fixing strength is 
obtained) is sufficiently low and the hot offsett temperature 
(Th; the lowest heat roller temperature when the hot offset is 
observed) is sufficiently high. In order to satisfy these two requirements, there have 
been done many proposals previously on the toner binder resin 
having a wide range of molecular weight distribution ranging from 
low molecular weight to high, for example, USP 3,941,898. 
EP-A-517 715 may be also cited in this connection. 
According to these proposals, the molecular weight distribution 
is spreaded to upperside by using a crosslinking agent or the 
like.  
 When the molecular weight distribution is spreaded to 
upper side by using a crosslinking agent as mentioned in the 
above, however, there occurs a defect of arising high Tf. On the other hand, such method may be also available 
as preparing a high molecular weight portion by a dispersion 
polymerization, and then mixing and solving it in a solvent with 
a low molecular weight polymer prepared separately. According to 
this method, however, when the molecular weight gap of these 
polymers is large, colorants such as carbon black and additives 
such as a charge controlling agent cannot be dispersed uniformly, 
that the charging property in the copy running is unstable, and 
that the blushing or the scattering of the toner occurs. It is one of the object of the present invention to 
obtain, by solving the above-mentioned problems, a binder resin 
for an electrophotographic toner available for supplying low Tf 
together with high Th. Another object of the invention is to obtain a binder 
resin for an electrophotographic toner providing a toner having a 
property of dispersing colorants such as carbon black and 
additives such as a charge controlling agent uniformly in the 
preparation of the toner, and giving an excellent copy running 
property. Still another object of the invention is to obtain an 
electrophotographic toner containing said binder resin. These and other objects of the invention will become more 
readily apparent from the description hereinafter.  
 Briefly the above-mentioned objects
