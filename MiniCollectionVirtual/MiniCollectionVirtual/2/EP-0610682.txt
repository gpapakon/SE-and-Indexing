<ABSTRACT>
The device optimises the use of energy of the drive 
batteries(1) of an electric vehicle allowing a driving 

strategy of the "economic" type or of the "sporting" type 
to be set by means of a selector (15). The device 

measures the instantaneous power (Pi) delivered by the 
batteries(1), compares the measured power (Pi) with a 

different reference value depending on the selected drive 
strategy, and controls a torque limiter (23) in 

dependence on the position of an accelerator member (25) 
and the result of the said comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for optimised use of the drive batteries of an electric 
vehicle. It is known that the range of an electric vehicle depends 
on the energy stored in the drive batteries which is 
strongly influenced by the driving "style"; that is to 
say a "sporting" type of driving with significant and 
sudden accelerations, and therefore with a requirement 
for high peaks of power, can severely reduce the range of 
the vehicle with respect to driving of the "quiet" type, 
that is without sharp speed variations. It is also known that the useful capacity of a battery 
depends in a non-proportional manner on the way in which 
it becomes discharged, in other words on the current 
required; for example, for a twelve Volt 50Ah lead-acid 
accumulator with a discharge current of 10A, the 
discharge time is about five hours, whilst with a 
discharge current of 20A the discharge time falls sharply 
to two hours, equivalent to a useful capacity of 40Ah 
rather than the nominal 50Ah.  
 Document US-A-3 943 420 discloses a battery vehicle having 
a normal speed range for house to house deliveries 
and an extended speed range from lengthy journeys such 
as to and from delivery rounds. The extended speed range 
is engageable by operation of a manual range control. 
The manual range control is rendered inoperative on 
startup so that the extended speed range is not immediately 
available but only after a delay. Thus, high speed 
operation which is very wasteful of energy is avoided 
for house to house deliveries, enabling the round to be 
completed.  
 It is therefore evident that to increase the range it is 
necessary to limit the discharge current as far as  
 
possible. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method and apparatus for the optimised utilisation of the 
drive batteries of an electric vehicle for the purpose of 
increasing its range, which is particularly effective, 
reliable and of low cost. According to the present invention this object is 
achieved by a method and apparatus having the 
characteristics set out in a specific manner in the 
claims which follow. The invention will now be described with reference to the 
attached drawings, provided purely by way of non-limitative 
example, in which: 
Figure 1 is a block schematic diagram illustrating 
the general structure of an apparatus according to the 
invention; Figure 2 illustrates a further embodiment of the 
apparatus of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the reference numeral 1 generally
