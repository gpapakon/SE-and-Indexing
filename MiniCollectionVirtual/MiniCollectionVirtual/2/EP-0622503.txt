<ABSTRACT>
Scaffolding as fixed or mobile scaffolding, composed of at least one bottom access platform which is releasibly fastened on horizontal crossmembers in the vicinity of the ground and are at a mutual distance from one another. In order to eliminate the play between the access platform and the crossmembers, the invention provides that a clamping fitting (8) which is connected to the access platform engages around the crossmember (5), in a positively locking manner in each case, and can be clamped onto the crossmember (5) in a frictionally locking manner by a pivotable closure part (16).

<CLAIMS>
Fixed or mobile scaffolding, consisting of at least one 
lower entry platform (3) which is detachably secured onto 

one of the girders (5) which are horizontal in position of 
use, close to the ground and have a reciprocal distance from 

each other, in which for the detachable securing at least of 
the entry platform (3) on the girder (5) a clamping mounting 

(8), connected with the entry platform (3), grasps around 
the girder (5) with a form fit, characterised in that the 

clamping mounting (8) can be clamped with a swivellable 
closure part (16) additionally with a force fit to the 

girder (5) which is constructed as a multiple-sided section. 
Scaffolding according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the clamping mounting (8) has an inner profiling adapted to 

the section of the girder (5). 
Scaffolding according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the clamping mounting (8) is slidable on the girder (5) 

with the closure part (16) swivelled away and opened. 
Scaffolding according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the clamping mounting (8) is connected 

to the end face of the object (3,4), which can be clamped 
on, with a first shank (14), which joins on to a second 

shank (15) arranged perpendicularly thereto, at the front 
end of which the closure part (16) is swivellably arranged, 

at the lower, free end of which a clamping screw (22) is 
secured which is swivellably mounted on the first shank 

(14), which clamping screw (22) is in engagement with the 
closure part (16). 
Scaffolding according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the first and second shanks (14, 15) 

of the clamping mounting (8) are connected with each other 
in one piece material.
