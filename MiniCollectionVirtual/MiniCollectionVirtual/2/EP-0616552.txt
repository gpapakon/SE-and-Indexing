<ABSTRACT>
An orthopaedic bone cement mixing device comprising a mixing bowl (1) and a lid (3), said lid (3) having a handle (4) extending outwardly therefrom. A mixing paddle (7) comprising a shaft (8) and vanes (9) extending outwardly therefrom extends into the bowl (1) from the lid (3) and is anchored in a groove (10) running around the base (2) of the bowl. A step-up gear mechanism (5, 11) is provided between the paddle (7) and the lid (3) such that, as the handle (4) is rotated the lid (3) rotates, causing the paddle (7) to rotate around the bowl (1). The drive wheel (5) of the gear mechanism is also caused to rotate and drives the driven wheel (11) which causes the shaft (8) of the paddle (7) to rotate about its own axis as the paddle (7) moves around the bowl (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for mixing 
orthopaedic bone cement or the like. Orthopaedic bone cement is used throughout the world 
to secure hip, knee and other metallic prostheses in an 
appropriate anatomical position. The bone cement is 
produced by thoroughly mixing together two components, 
usually methylmethacrylate monomer liquid and 
polymethylmethacrylate powder. The mixing is usually 
carried out using a simple bowl and spatula. The surgeon 
then removes the required amount of cement and 
manipulates it by hand before inserting it into a 
preformed cavity or applying it to a resected bony 
surface where the prosthesis is to be positioned. Cement 
may either be applied by hand or may be put into a 
syringe and applied thereby. However, this simple mixing 
method has two major drawbacks. Firstly, free methylmethacrylate fumes are emitted 
from the mixture. It is desirable to remove these fumes, 
or prevent them from escaping into the atmosphere, since 
they have an unpleasant odour and may be harmful to 
operating room personnel. The fumes are known to cause 
nausea and giddiness and are generally objectionable, 
particularly to the nurses who actually carry out the 
mixing. Recently there has also been concern that long 
term exposure to these fumes results in a more serious 
health risk. Current employment law relating to 
occupational health means medical staff must now be 
protected against the exposure to hazardous substances.  
 Secondly, a very high mixing efficiency is required 
to produce a homogenous cement material. During the 
mixing process air is naturally introduced into the 
mixture since air is inherently existent within the 
powder and also in and around the mixing vessel. 
The introduction 
of air produces a weak cement and, since the joint must 
usually support a heavy load, it is important to reduce 
the amount of air in the mixture as much as possible in 
order to improve the mechanical strength of the cement 
material. In order to eliminate as much air as possible from 
the mixture mixing is now preferably carried out under 
vacuum. This considerably reduces the amount of air in 
the mixture. Mixing in a conventional bowl and spatula 
system can produce a product with a porosity value of 
approximately 20 to 25%. In a vacuum mix, the porosity 
is often reduced to levels below 5%. Several devices for mixing the cement in a vacuum 
are presently available. The most successful of these 
combine a mixing chamber with a syringe. For example,

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held mixing device for bone cement or the 
like, comprising an enclosed mixing chamber (1), a lid 

(3) which fits over said chamber (1), a port (12) in a 
wall of said chamber for connection to a vacuum source 

in use to enable a vacuum to be created in said chamber 
(1), a mixing paddle (7) extending into said chamber 

(1), and a rotatable handle (4) coupled to said paddle 
(7) by a gear mechanism (5, 11) arranged such that 

rotation of said handle (4) causes said paddle (7) to 
rotate about its own axis; characterised in that said 

paddle (7) is carried by an axle which is eccentrically 
coupled to the handle (4) such that rotation of said 

handle (4) also moves the axis of rotation of the paddle 
(7) within the chamber (1), whereby the paddle is moved 

around substantially the entire cement containing region 
of the interior of the chamber (1), and wherein the 

number of rotations of the paddle (7) about its own axis 
produced by a single rotation of the handle is not a 

whole number so that the paddle ends up in a different 
orientation after each single full rotation of the handle (4). 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the device is in the form of a bowl (1). 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in claim 1 or  
 

2 wherein said gear mechanism (5, 11) is a step-up gear 
such that a single rotation of the handle (4) produces a 

plurality of rotations of the paddle (7) about its own 
axis. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim further comprising locking means (14) 

for securely holding said lid (3) in place during 
mixing. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein said handle (4) is rotatably 

mounted in the lid (3) and extends outwardly therefrom 
to be rotated by the user. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim further comprising a circular rack (5) 

fixed to the underside of the lid (3), and arranged 
coaxially with the rotation axis of the handle (4) which 

drivingly co-operates with a cog wheel (11) which drives 
the paddle axle to rotate the paddle (7) as the handle  

 
(4) is turned. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein said mixing paddle (7) comprises 

a shaft (8) and at least one vane (9) extending 
outwardly from the shaft, wherein such vane (9) extends 

out to the edge of the chamber and conforms to the shape 
of the interior of said chamber. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim further comprising a guide groove (10) 

in the base of the chamber in which the base of the 
paddle (7), or an axle carrying the paddle, is supported 

as it rotates around the chamber. 
A hand-held mixing device as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein said chamber is at least partly 

transparent. 
The use of a device as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 9 in the mixing of bone cement.
