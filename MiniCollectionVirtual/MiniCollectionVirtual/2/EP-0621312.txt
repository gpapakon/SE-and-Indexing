<ABSTRACT>
An epoxy resin composition which is tough and excellent in heat resistance and adhesion is produced by dispersing in an 
epoxy resin the particles of a polymer having a glass transition point of 20 °C or below and prepared by the emulsion polymerization 

of a (meth)acrylate monomer in the presence of an emulsifying agent comprising an alkyl-terminated polymer having an acid 
value of 200 or above and prepared by polymerizing a polymerizable monomer containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid, or a 

salt of said polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an epoxy resin
composition which is tough and has excellent heat
resistance and adhesion, and a method for producing the
same. Epoxy resin compositions are extremely useful as
adhesives, molding materials, paints and sealants.Since epoxy resins have well-balanced performance,
for example, in thermal, mechanical and electrical
characteristics, they have been generally utilized in
various application uses such as adhesives, paints,
materials for electric and electronic parts and
constructing and building materials. However, since the
epoxy resins have a drawback that curing products thereof
are hard and brittle, there have been studied, for example,
a method of blending a plasticizing ingredient or a method
of using a monofunctional epoxy compound together, thereby
reducing crosslink density for improving the drawback. However, since heat resistance of the curing products
is remarkably lowered, though the toughness is improved
no fundamental solution has been provided, by such
methods. In view of the above, a method of modifying an
epoxy resin with various kinds of rubber has been
considered. For example, there has been a method of
introducing functional groups reactive with an epoxy
resin or an epoxy resin curing agent into the molecule of
a rubber and carrying out reaction under the coexistence
of such a rubber in a curing reaction system of the epoxy
resin. According to this method, the toughness of the
epoxy resin is considerably improved and, depending on
the case, a curing product of satisfactory heat
resistance can be obtained. However, there has been a
problem that the configuration of rubber particles to be
dispersed is changed failing to provide an effective
improvement for the toughness or the rubber is partially
or entirely compatibilized with the epoxy resin to
deteriorate the heat resistance depending on the kind of
the curing agent used or the curing condition.Further, there has also been known a method of
adding modifying rubber particles obtained by emulsion
polymerization into an epoxy resin, by which the
foregoing problem can be solved, since this method causes
no configurational change of the modifying rubber 
particles and compatibilization with the epoxy resin.
depending on the curing condition or the like. As the
modifying method of this type the followings have been
known. That is, Japanese Patent Laid Open Sho 52-36198
discloses a composition in which a curing agent is added
to a mixture of an emulsified elastomer and a liquid or
emulsified epoxy
