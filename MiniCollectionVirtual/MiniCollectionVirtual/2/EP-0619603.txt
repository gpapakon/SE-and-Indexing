<ABSTRACT>
The method and apparatus of this invention for 
evaluation of a semiconductor production process effect 

the determination of the shallow pit density of a 
silicon wafer by predetermining the correlation between 

the average shallow pit density on a wafer surface 
obtained by microscopic observation and the average 

magnitude of a scattered light on the wafer surface 
obtained by the determination with the wafer surface 

inspection system operated in the haze mode, 
determining the average magnitude on the wafer surface 

of a scattered light for a silicon wafer treated by a 
semiconductor production process under evaluation, and 

analyzing the data found by the determination in 
combination with the correlation mentioned above. Thus, 

they bring about an effect of enabling the 
determination to be carried out automatically and 

quickly and exalting the accuracy of determination and 
allowing a generous cut in the time required for the 

determination as compared with the conventional 
determination resorting to visual measurement and 

evaluation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the 
evaluation of a semiconductor production process and 
more particularly to a method for the determination of 
a shallow pit density on a surface of a silicon wafer, 
an apparatus for the determination of a shallow pit 
density on a surface of a silicon wafer, and a method 
for the evaluation of cleanliness of a heat-treating 
furnace or accessorial devices thereof. In a process for the production of a semiconductor 
device, a silicon wafer is subjected to a thermal 
oxidation treatment for the formation of an oxide film 
and a thermal diffusion treatment for the diffusion of 
dopant impurities. An oxidizing furnace and a diffusing 
furnace are used as devices for these treatments. For the purpose of producing semiconductor devices 
at a highly satisfactory yield, it is extremely 
important to manage a process and apparatus for the 
production lest metallic and other pollutants should 
adhere to the surfaces of silicon wafers and further 
diffuse in the silicon wafers. When heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Fe, etc.) are present on 
or within the component members of the production  
 
apparatus, however, they precipitate the silicides 
such as of Ni and/or Cu in the form of clusters of 
minute defects on the surfaces of silicon wafers during 
the heat treatment and generate a visually discernible 
haze (extremely minute rises and falls of wafer 
surface). There are also times when these heavy metals 
form nucleations and generate stacking faults. When the 
silicon wafers generate such crystal defects as hazes 
and stacking faults, these crystal defects degrade the 
mechanical and electrical properties of the silicon 
wafers and entail a problem of lowering of the yield. The maintenance of such heat-treating furnaces as 
oxidation furnaces in a state of high cleanliness, 
therefore, is important from the point of view of 
preventing the problem mentioned above. Thus, the 
necessity of establishing a technique for accurate 
evaluation of this cleanliness is finding recognition. As means for this evaluation, JP-B-5-2,937 
discloses a method which comprises heat-treating a 
silicon wafer with a heat-treating furnace in an 
oxidizing atmosphere, preferentially etching the 
heat-treated silicon wafer and microscopically observing 
shallow pits consequently formed on the etched surface 
thereof, and determining the shallow pit density by 
visually counting the number of shallow pits. As a apparatus capable of automatically rating 
such pits on a silicon wafer as shallow pits by

preparatorily the correlation between the average value

of the magnitude of scattered light caused on said 

wafer surface by the shallow pits (the quotient of the
