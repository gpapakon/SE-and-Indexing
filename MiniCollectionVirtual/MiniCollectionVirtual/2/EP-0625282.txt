<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to capacitance
humidity sensors, particularly to humidity sensors
having a moisture sensitive dielectric layer interposed
between a pair of conductors, and still more
particularly to the use of polymers having sulfur atoms
in their backbone chains as the resin matrix for the
conductor layers.In commonly-owned United States Patent No.
4,965,698 issued October 23, 1990 to Thoma, et al. for
"Capacitance Humidity Sensor", hereafter the '698
patent, a device of the general type with which the
present invention is concerned is described in
considerable detail. The device of the '698 patent
includes a core made of a material whose dielectric
constant varies substantially linearly with humidity,
such as a polyimide or polyparabanic acid material. The 
core is sandwiched between layers of polymeric material
having conductive particles, such as conductive carbon
particles, dispersed therein. In the '698 patent, the
resin matrix for the conductive layers is described as
containing certain crosslinked polymers formed by the
reaction of a compound containing glucoside chains and a
monomer or partial polymer capable of reacting with the
hydroxyl groups of the glucosides. Specific examples of
the disclosed materials included cellulose nitrate,
cellulose triacetate, cellulose butyrate and, most
preferably, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) crosslinked
with urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde.Reference was also made in the background section
of the '698 patent to other types of known humidity
sensors which included a dielectric layer and thin metal
electrode conducting layers. Reference should be made
to the patents cited in column 1 of the '698 patent for
examples of such systems. The prior systems discussed
in the earlier patent were deemed to have poor corrosion
resistance, since thin metal electrodes could rapidly be
destroyed by sulfur-based pollutants or chlorine.Polyimides have been recognized as a particularly
useful dielectric for such sensors because the
dielectric constant is linearly proportional to the
moisture content. However, bonding between the
polyimide and prior art metal foil electrode layers was
difficult without the use of adhesives because of the
dissimilarity between the metal and plastic.The '698 patent also discusses the use of mixtures
of conductive particles, such as particles of silver or
carbon black, dispersed in resins such as polyimides as
shown, for example, in the Takenaka, United States
Patent No. 3,697,450 issued October 10, 1972. It was
