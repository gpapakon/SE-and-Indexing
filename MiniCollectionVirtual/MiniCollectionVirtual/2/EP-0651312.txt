<ABSTRACT>
A drive circuit (10) comprises a plurality of current mirrors (50, 60, 70) 
connected in series at their output-current end with a load resistor (15) between two 

power rails (11, 12). The input halves (51, 61, 71) of the mirrors are driven by 
respective groups of series-connected input transistors (53-56, 63-65, 73-74), the lowest 

transistor (56, 65, 74) in each group serving to set up the required currents in the 
mirrors in response to an input voltage (13) on its base. Two potential dividers (90, 

80) set up potentials on the control terminals of the groups of input transistors, on the 
one hand, and potentials on the main-terminal junctions of the mirror output transistors, 

on the other, such that at no time does any transistor in the circuit experience a voltage 
greater than its rated voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a drive circuit, and in particular a varactor line drive
circuit for integration into a synthesizer circuit.The use of varactor tuning in frequency synthesizers is well known and
conventionally requires that the varactor (a varicap diode exhibiting a capacitance
inversely proportional to the magnitude of the reverse-bias voltage across it) be driven
by a synthesizer stage via a drive transistor external to that stage. A typical scheme
is shown in Figure 1, in which a synthesizer stage 20 drives the varactor input 31 of
a tuner stage 30 by means of an external drive transistor 32 in conjunction with a load
resistor 33 coupled to a high-voltage supply 34. Instructions are passed from a control
microprocessor 40 along an I2C bus 41 to the synthesizer 20 to select the desired
channel frequency in the tuner 30. These instructions are compared with the actual
frequency of the tuner oscillator 33, which is conveyed along a line 38 to the
synthesizer stage 20, to provide an error signal in the synthesizer stage. This error
signal is then used to bring the frequency of the oscillator 33 nearer to the required
frequency by arranging for it to vary the signal on the base of the drive transistor 32.
The resulting variation in the collector voltage of transistor 32 causes the reverse bias
on the varicap 34 to change, and it is this change in reverse bias which brings about
a corresponding change in the capacitance of the varicap 34, thereby adjusting the
frequency of the oscillator 33 to the required frequency. Finally, the correctly adjusted
oscillator signal in the tuner 30 is mixed with an incoming RF signal from an antenna
35 in a mixer 36 to produce an output IF signal on a line 37. It is a common requirement in the art to be able to integrate as many functions
as possible onto one chip. However, up till now, considerable problems have beset the
designer who wished to integrate a drive transistor such as that shown as transistor 32
in Figure 1 into an integrated stage such as the synthesizer stage 20 shown in the same
figure. This is because the varactor drive circuit is required to operate at anywhere up
to 35 volts, although the breakdown voltages inherent in the manufacturing process
used for the synthesizer stage 20 are only in the region of 10-20 volts, depending on
which junction in the produced chip is being used as a reference.According to the invention, there is provided a drive circuit which is
characterised by comprising first and second power supply rails; a plurality of
