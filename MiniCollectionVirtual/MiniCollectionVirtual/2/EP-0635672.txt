<ABSTRACT>
A pressure vessel, in particular a pressure storage vessel, for example a compressed air container for brake pressure units and pneumatic auxiliary devices in lorries, trucks, omnibuses, rail vehicles and the like, or fire extinguishers, comprises a liquid-tight, injection-moulded liner or base element made from thermoplastic, such as polypropylene, polyamide (nylon) and the like, in which openings for connectors are provided, and an armouring (reinforcing) layer arranged on the liner. The thermoplastic of the liner is reinforced with short glass fibres, and the liner itself is surrounded by a captive, one-piece covering. This covering comprises polypropylene (PP) or polyamide (PA) or modified polyphenylene ether (PPE) or polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) or polyetherimide (PEI), reinforced with short fibres preferably glass fibres, and containing fillers. The armouring layer can be omitted if desired.

<CLAIMS>
Compressed-air reservoir of plastic for air brake 
assemblies and pneumatic auxiliary mechanisms on 

lorries, trucks, buses, rail vehicles and the like, 
consisting of an injection-moulded liner of 

thermoplastic material which is provided with openings 
for connecting sleeves, and a reinforcing fibre 

mattress placed on the liner, which in turn is provided 
with a captive jacket of thermoplastic material,
wherein
 
the liner 
(2)
 consists of several components of 
polypropylene 
(PP)
 or polyamide 
(PA)
 reinforced with 
short glass fibres, assembled not seamless but 

form-fit, and the jacket 
(9)
 consists of polypropylene 

(PP)
 or polyamide 
(PA)
 or modified polyphenyl ether 

(PPE)
 or polyphenyl sulphide 
(PPS)
 or polyether imide 

(PEI)
 reinforced with glass fibres and/or carbon fibres 
of up to 50 mm length and mixed with fillers. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
the reinforcing mattress consists of glass fibres or 

metal wires - wound at an angle of about 55Â° to each 
other - or of wire mesh.  

 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
liner 
(2)
 and jacket 
(9)
 consist of identical plastic 
material. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
liner 
(2)
 and jacket 
(9)
 consist of different plastic 
material. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
liner 
(2)
 and jacket 
(9)
 contain up to 30 % of fibres 
and filler. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
the fibres in the liner 
(2)
 and the jacket 
(9)
 are of 
identical material. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
the fibres in the liner 
(2)
 and the jacket 
(9)
 are of 
different material.  

 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 5
wherein
 
the filler consists of graphite or talcum or powdered 

rock or the mixtures thereof. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
the liner components are joined form-fit to make them 

liquid-proof. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claims 1 
and 9, 
wherein
 
the form-fit joint is designed as serration 
(12)
 of the 
liner walling, withstanding both tension and 

compression. 
Compressed-air reservoir as set forth in Claim 1,
wherein
 
the suface of the liner 
(2)
 has a structure that can 
hold the reinforcing fibre mattress 
(11)
.  
 
Method for the manufacture of compressed-air 
reservoirs as set forth in Claim 1, with first a liner 


(2)
 being injection-moulded from polypropylene 
(PP)
 or 
polyamide 
(PA)
, which is then wrapped with a mattress 
of cross-braced fibres for reinforcement, filled with 

an incompressible medium avoiding air inclusions, 
brought into a form for manufacture of the jacket, and 

then embedded in thermoplastic material through 
injection or casting,
wherein
 
the liner 
(2)
 is made of several components 
(3, 4)
 of 
polypropylene or polyamide which are reinforced with 

short glass fibres and can be joined form-fit, and 
granular material of polypropylene 
(PP)
, polyamide 

(PA)
, modified polyphenyl ether 
(PPE)
, polyphenyl 
sulphide 
(PPS)
 or polyether imide 
(PEI)
- reinforced 
with fibres and fillers - is used for injection-moulding 

of the jacket, the reinforcement being made of 
glass fibres and/or carbon fibres of up to 50 mm 

length, preferably 20 mm. 
Method as set forth in Claim 12,
wherein
 
for polypropylene 
(PP)
 chemically-coupled glass fibres 
are used.  

 
Method as set forth in Claim 12,
wherein
 
the reinforcing fibre mattress 
(11)

wherein
 
preferably caprolactam is used for impregnation of the 

glass fibres. 
Method as set forth in Claims 12 through 15,
wherein
 
the incompressible medium 
(10)
