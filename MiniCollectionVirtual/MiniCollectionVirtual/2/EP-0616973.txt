<ABSTRACT>
The acid content of aqueous acidic hydroxylamine salt solutions 
is reduced by electrolysing the solution in the cathode compartment of 

a divided electrolysis cell in which the cathode and anode compartments 
are separated by an anionic membrane and using an aqueous acid as the 

anolyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for reducing acid 
content of a solution comprising a hydroxylamine salt and an acid. Hydroxylamine salts may be represented by the formulae: 
wherein R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen or hydrocarbyl groups, X 
is an anion of an acid and y is the valence of X. Hydroxylamine salts 
are compounds which have a variety of applications. For instance, 
hydroxylamine nitrate may be used as a component of liquid propellant 
and as a reducing agent in photographic operations. In some of these 
applications, it is desirable that a hydroxylamine salt solution of 
high purity is available. Furthermore, it is particularly desirable 
that a solution containing the hydroxylamine salt also contain a 
reduced acid content. There exist several production methods to manufacture 
hydroxylamine salts. In the case of hydroxylamine nitrate for example, 
some of these  
 
methods include: electrodialysis of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and nitric acid; 
reaction of hydroxylamine sulfate and barium nitrate; three-step cation exchange 
process employing hydroxylamine sulfate and nitric acid; and electrolytic 
reduction of nitric acid. These methods, however, do not provide hydroxylamine 
salt solutions of high purity which some applications of the compound require. 
As a result, procedures have been developed to purify the hydroxylamine salt 
solutions produced by existing methods. Hydroxylamine salt solutions, at present, 
are purified using thin film evaporators, vacuum-stripping, or other procedures. 
Nevertheless, there remains a substantial demand for large quantities of high 
purity hydroxylamine salt solutions. The substantial demand demonstrates that 
present production methods and purification procedures may be improved. In light of this substantial demand, French Patent 2,602,802 is 
directed to an electrolytic process to directly produce high purity solutions of 
hydroxylamine nitrate. In particular, a process is described for producing by 
electrolysis a hydroxylamine nitrate solution in an electrochemical cell 
containing a cathode compartment, an anode compartment and a separator 
between the cathode compartment and anode compartment. Said process is 
characterized in that it includes the following operations: (a) introducing a 
catholyte, essentially containing an aqueous nitric acid solution, in the cathode 
compartment; (b) introducing an anolyte solution into the anode compartment; 
(c) electrolyzing the catholyte to a cathode potential between about 0.5 and 1.4 
volt
