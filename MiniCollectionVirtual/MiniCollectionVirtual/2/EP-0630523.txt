<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit including a semiconductor substrate, a semiconductor layer formed on the substrate, a desired bipolar transistor formed in the semiconductor layer. First and second parasitic elements are formed in the integrated circuit. An element is provided which detects when the second parasitic element becomes active or which prevents increase of the collector-to-emitter voltage of the desired bipolar transistor in response to current flowing through the second parasitic transistor. This element may be a semiconductor region formed in the semiconductor layer. The transistor may be an npn or pnp type transistor manufactured according to a complementary bipolar process or other process which results in a transistor with first and second parasitic elements. The present invention is also well-suited for use in the output stage of an operational amplifier. The element which detects activity of the second parasitic transistor intercepts carriers flowing towards the junction isolation bands and substrate from the collector of the desired bipolar transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated circuit
constructions for controlling saturation of a
transistor and methods for making such circuit
constructions. More particularly, the present
invention relates to constructions for controlling the
saturation of a transistor fabricated using a
complementary bipolar process.Bipolar transistors are often used in a state
of saturation. In this state, in some integrated
circuits, parasitic transistors become active and may
cause undesirable effects in the operation of the
principal transistor.Figure 1 illustrates a typical NPN transistor
element 8 manufactured according to a complementary
bipolar process. An example of such a circuit and a 
method for making it is disclosed in U.S. patents
4,969,823 and 5,065,214, which are hereby incorporated
by reference. This transistor element is typically
formed on an N-type substrate 10. On the substrate
10, a P-well 12 is formed. In the P-well 12, an
N-type subcollector 16 is formed. An N-type region 14
is also formed to make part of a junction isolation
band for isolating from one another multiple devices
on an integrated circuit. A P-type epitaxial layer 13
is formed on the N-type region 16, P-well 12 and
substrate 10. In the epitaxial layer 13, an N-type
region 15 is formed to make the collector of the
transistor. This region 15 extends to the N-type
sub-collector 16. A contact 11 is provided for this
collector also. Another N-type region 17, extending
to region 14 completes the junction isolation band. A
P-type diffusion region 18 is formed in region 15 to
form the base of the transistor. A contact 19 is also
provided for the base. An N+ type region 20 is formed
in region 18 to make the emitter of the transistor.Other processes and structures may result in an
integrated circuit construction in which the present
invention suitably may be used. Such structures 
include NPN or PNP transistors formed in P-type or
N-type layers, respectively. These layers, for
multiple circuit elements on an integrated circuit are
isolated, respectively, by N-type or P-type junction
isolation bands.A conventional transistor such as shown in Fig.
1 may be understood schematically by the diagram of
Fig.2 where it will be seen to comprise a principal
transistor 22 as well as two parasitic transistors 29
and 34. The parasitic transistors are undesired but
are a consequence of the way the principal transistor
is formed. The principal transistor 22 has as its
base 23, region 18; as its collector 24, regions 15
and 16; and as its emitter 25, region
