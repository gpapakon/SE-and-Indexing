<ABSTRACT>
A pay television system comprises, on the reception side, a decoder and a separate card (12) capable of being connected to the decoder, the decoder receiving both a scrambled video signal and an enciphered unscrambling code. The decoder includes a memory (9) intended for storing a video signal which arrives at the decoder in an unscrambled mode, and a first microprocessor (11) intended for controlling the said memory (9) in order to unscramble the video signal, this first microprocessor (11) being linked with the separate card (12). This card (12) includes a second microprocessor (40) with a memory (41, 42, 43) intended for storing codes relating to purchased transmissions, for receiving the unscrambling code and for transmitting the deciphered unscrambling code to the decoder. This decoder then uses the deciphered unscrambling code in order to unscramble the scrambled video signal with the aid of the memory (9), and thus allow display of the broadcast transmission in clear.

Pay-TV system, intended to manage a scrambled television signal
when an emission has been purchased, comprising on the receiver side a

decoder and a separate card (12) that can be connected to said decoder,
where the decoder receives at once a scrambled video signal where the

scrambling has been brought about as a function of a scrambling code, and a
ciphered identification signal comprising at least an identification code that

corresponds to the identification of an emission and of said scrambling code,
where said decoder includes:


a memory (9) arranged to store the video signal that arrives in
scrambled form at the decoder, and to descramble said video signal;

and
a first microprocessor (11) in communication with said card (12) to
which it communicates said identification signal, arranged to

descramble said video signal, where this first microprocessor (11) uses
the deciphered scrambling code furnished by card (12) as the

descrambling parameter;

and said card (12) includes:

a second microprocessor (40) with memory (41, 42, 43) arranged to
store the codes referring to emissions purchased, to receive said

identification signal and to transmit to the decoder said deciphered
scrambling code; where this decoder then uses said deciphered

scrambling code to descramble with the aid of said memory (9) said
scrambled video signal and to thus permit a clear display of the

broadcast emission.
Pay-TV system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 during
emission an information (26) relating to the identification of the emission to be

transmitted and an identification signal (34) are produced and sent to a
system of ciphering (27) which furnishes in real time the ciphered signal (28)

that is to be transmitted, and during reception the transmitted signal is
delivered together with the identification signal to an deciphering system (29) 

which delivers the deciphered scrambling code word and the identification
information (26), while the code word controls a pseudo-random generator

(30) which in its turn delivers descrambling codes to descramble in the
decoder the video signal that is received in scrambled form.
Pay-TV system according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said
deciphered scrambling code word controls the pseudo-random generator (30)

which in its turn delivers pointers (31) to carry out markings in a table (32)
consisting of a plurality of scrambling codes, such that the marked scrambling

codes be used to control said memory (9) so that it sets free said video signal
in an descrambled manner.
Pay-TV system according to claims 1, 2 or 3 where the memory (9) of
the decoder is arranged to receive a video signal scrambled by permutation of

lines in which each line is sampled and digitized to a certain number of
samples, and means to descramble the stored video signal according to a

variable descrambling code,

   
characterized in that
 said memory (9) consists of a buffer of lines (18),
for instance 32 lines, divided in juxtaposed cells (19) into which said samples

(20) are sequentially introduced, while each line (18) of the buffer consists of
that number of cells (19) that is necessary to store the number of samples (20,

21) of one video signal line,

where entry of each sample (20) into a buffer cell causes the exit from
that cell of the sample (21) stored 
in that
 same cell, such that said memory (9)
is always filled with the number of lines, and each line of the buffer (18) is

always filled with the number of samples (21, 20) that it can hold,
where the order of extraction of stored buffer lines (18) for
descrambling is determined by selecting under the control of said scrambling

code among the buffer lines those that will permit the de-permutation of the
lines.
Pay-TV system according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 each line of
the digitized video signal comprises three or four times 256 samples of eight 

bits each, these samples being stored in an equal number of cells (19) of one
line (18) of the buffer.
Pay-TV system according to any of claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that

the buffer comprises 32 lines.
Pay-TV system according to any of claims 4 to 6 for the decoding of a
video signal in which the data are stored in the vertical fly back lines and only

the active part of the line is permuted, including the vertical fly back lines,
while the horizontal synchronization is not permuted, so that said data are

scrambled at the same time as the image.
Pay-TV system according to any of claims 4 to 7 for the decoding of a
video signal in which in addition to permutation of the lines each line thus

permuted also is subject to a rotation of the line's active part around itself.
Pay-TV system according to any of claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that

the means for descrambling the stored video signal comprise: a deciphering
system (29) of a CPTV card delivering a deciphered code word and a pseudo-random

generator (30) delivering pointers (31) to a table (32) containing a
number of permutation codes, which table selects among the lines (18) of the

buffer those that will permit de-permutation.
Pay-TV system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the card (12)
comprises a credit memory and transmits the scrambling code to the decoder

provided the credit remaining on said card (12) is higher than the price of the
emission selected by the user.
Pay-TV system according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the decoder comprises means to store and display information on
future emissions and comprises means for the user to select the emissions he

wishes to purchase.
Pay-TV system according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the card (12) comprises a memory for storing information concerning 
the emissions purchased, and means to transmit this information to the

decoder.
Pay-TV system according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
in that
 the card (12) comprises a clock the value of which determines
transmission of the scrambling key to the decoder.
