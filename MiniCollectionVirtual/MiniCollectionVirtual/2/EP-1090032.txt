 MEMBRANE-PERMEANT PEPTIDE COMPLEXES FOR MEDICAL IMAGING, DIAGNOSTICS, AND PHARMACEUTICAL THERAPYBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe present invention broadly relates to the field of medicine. More specifically, the present invention relates to the fields of medical imaging, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical therapy. The present invention provides methods and compositions for medical imaging, evaluating intracellular processes, radiotherapy of intracellular targets, and drug delivery by the use of novel cell membrane-permeant peptide conjugate coordination and covalent complexes having target cell specificity. The present invention also provides kits for conjugating radionuclides and other metals to the peptide coordination complexes.Description of Related ArtRadiopharmaceuticals in Diagnosis and TherapyRadiopharmaceuticals provide vital information that aids in the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of medical diseases (Horn, et al., Nucl Med Biol 24:485-498, 1997). Data on tissue shape, function, and localization within the body are relayed by use of one of the various radionuclides, which can be either free chemical species, such as the gas 133Xe or the ions 123T and 201T1", covalently or coordinately bound as part of a larger organic or inorganic moiety, the images being generated by the distribution of radioactive decay of the nuclide. Radionuclides that are most useful for medical imaging include πC (t1/2 20.3 min), 13N (t1/2 9.97 min), 15O (t1/2 2.03 min), 18F (t1/2 109.7 min), MCu (t1/2 12 h), 68Ga (t1/2 68 min) for positron emission tomography (PET) and 67Ga (t1/2 68 min), 99mTc (t1/2 6 h), 123I (t1/2 13 h) and 201T1 (t1/2 73.5 h) for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (Horn, et al, Nucl Med Biol 24:485-498, 1997).SPECT and PET imaging provide accurate data on radionuclide distribution at the desired target tissue by detection of the gamma photons that result from radionuclide decay. The high degree of spatial resolution of modern commercial SPECT and PET scanners enables images to be generated that map the radionuclide 

decay events into an image that reflects the distribution of the agent in the body. These images thus contain anatomic and functional information useful in medical diagnosis. Similarly, if the radionuclides decay in such a manner as to deposit radiation energy in or near the target cells or tissues, the same approach would enable therapeutically relevant doses of radioactivity to be deposited within the tissues.
