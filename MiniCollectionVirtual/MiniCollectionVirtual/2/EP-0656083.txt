<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an environmental-friendly process for reducing the content of chloride in a liquor inventory of a chemical pulp mill. According to the invention, in a recovery system for pulping chemicals containing sulphur and an alkali metal, precipitator dust formed in a recovery boiler is collected and withdrawn, dissolved in water and electrolyzed for production of chlorine or hydrochloric acid in the anolyte. Since the dust normally contains a large amount of sodium sulphate, sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide can also be produced in the electrolysis. To reduce the content of impurities, before the electrolysis, the pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted to above about 10 to precipitate inorganic substances which are separated-off together with flocculated or undissolved substances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an environmental-friendly 
process for reducing the content of chloride in a 
liquor inventory of a chemical pulp mill. According to the 
invention, in a recovery system for pulping chemicals containing 
sulphur and an alkali metal, precipitator dust formed in 
a recovery boiler is collected and withdrawn, dissolved in 
water and electrolyzed for production of chlorine or hydrochloric 
acid in the anolyte. Since the dust normally contains a 
large amount of sodium sulphate, sulphuric acid and sodium 
hydroxide can also be produced in the electrolysis. To reduce 
the content of impurities, before the electrolysis, the pH of 
the aqueous solution is adjusted to above about 10 to precipitate 
inorganic substances which are separated-off together 
with flocculated or undissolved substances. 
Background to the inventionIn the production of a chemical pulp, chips of lignocellulose-containing 
material are cooked in an alkaline or 
acid aqueous solution. This cooking liquor contains inorganic 
pulping chemicals to improve the dissolution of lignin. The 
cooking is normally carried out at a temperature above 100Â°C 
to reduce the residence time for the pulp produced. Therefore, 
the cooking is carried out in a pressure vessel known as a 
digester. In the production of sulphate and sulphite pulps with an 
alkali metal as a base, normally sodium, it is possible to 
recover the inorganic pulping chemicals in the spent liquor 
leaving the digester. It is vital both to economy and environment 
to recover these pulping chemicals to the largest possible 
extent. This is achieved in the pulping chemical recovery 
system, which essentially transfers the used inorganic pulping 
chemicals into a chemical state, where they can be used again 
for cooking. An essential part of the recovery system is the recovery 
boiler, where the spent liquor is burned. Normally, make-up 
chemicals are added to the spent liquor before the recovery 
boiler to make up for the chemicals lost during cooking and 
recovery. The spent liquor is sprayed into the lower part of 
the boiler, previously at a relatively low temperature to  
 
remove free water. Modern recovery boilers operate at a high 
temperature to reduce the content of sulphur in the flow gases 
leaving the boiler. Higher up in the boiler, gases and vapours 
of light hydrocarbons and decomposition products are volatilized. 
This is known as pyrolysis. Then, the pyrolysis products 
are burned after mixing with air or oxygen. The solid carbon-based
