<ABSTRACT>
An improved dual battery power system uses two separate battery power sources for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, each having optimized characteristics for monitoring functions and for output energy delivery functions, respectively. The monitoring functions are supplied electrical power by a first battery source, such as a conventional pacemaker power source in the form of a pair of lithium iodide batteries, which is optimized for long life at very low current levels. The output energy delivery functions are supplied by a separate second battery source, such as a pair of lithium vanadium pentoxide batteries, which is optimized for high current drain capability and low self-discharge for long shelf life. The first battery source provides electrical power only to the monitoring functions of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and the second battery source provides all of the electrical power for the output energy delivery functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention - The present invention pertains to a 
cardioverter defibrillator, and more particularly, to an improved dual 
battery power system for use with an implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator. 2. Background of the Invention - Implantable cardioverter 
defibrillators have several unique battery requirements, as compared to 
other implantable products. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
demands a battery with the following general characteristics: very high 
reliability, highest possible energy density (i.e., small size), extremely low 
self-discharge rating (i.e., long shelf life), very high current capability, high 
operating voltage, and high sealability (i.e., no gas or liquid venting). Some of these parameters have some measure of mutual 
exclusivity, making it difficult to optimize the battery or electronics 
without making compromises to the design of the implantable device. In 
its monitoring mode, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator requires 
the battery to deliver continuous currents in the range of only 10 - 30 µA, 
while in its defibrillation mode, the same battery must deliver currents in 
the range of one to two amps, some five orders of magnitude greater than 
the current required for the monitoring mode.  
 Presently, all manufactured implantable cardioverter defibrillators 
use a single battery system to power the implantable device. The longevity 
of an implanted cardioverter defibrillator with a single battery 
configuration and the number of shocks the defibrillator is capable of 
delivering are strictly dependant on the remaining battery capacity at any 
given time. As the device ages, its ability to deliver an adequate number 
of defibrillating shocks declines as the battery is depleted by the 
monitoring electronics. Similarly, if a patient receives a large number of 
shocks soon after implant, the remaining monitoring life is reduced. 
Thus, it is difficult to assess the condition of the battery and its remaining 
useful life after it has been in use for a period of time. A further disadvantage of the single battery configuration is that the 
ideal voltage requirements for the monitoring and output functions are 
opposite. For the monitoring function, it is desirable to use the lowest 
possible voltage that the circuits can operate reliably with in order to 
conserve energy. This is typically in the order of 1.5 - 3.0 V. On the other 
hand, the output circuit works most efficiently with the highest possible 
battery voltage in order to produce
