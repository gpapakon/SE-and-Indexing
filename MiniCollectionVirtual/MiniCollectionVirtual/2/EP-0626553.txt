<ABSTRACT>
In an igniter of this invention, an insulated cup (43) and a 
harness supporter (45) for forming an igniter body are made of an 

insulating member (59) and a lead electrode (63) which is connected 
to the ground is electrically conducted to a header case (57), so that 

ignition of an igniting agent (49) due to discharge of static 
electricity can be surely prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an igniter to be disposed in an 
air bag inflation gas generator or the like. A prior shock absorber to protect a passenger car driver 
from shocks at collision accidents comprises an air bag and a gas 
generator to inflate the air bag with gas. At a collision 
accident of a passenger car, explosives or other gas generating 
agents having a similar composition thereto, which are charged 
in the gas generator, are ignited and burnt to produce gas. The 
air bag is instantaneously inflated by the resultant gas for 
protecting the driver against any collision shocks, thereby 
avoiding possible serious injury of the driver. And, in the above type of air bag inflation gas generator, 
an igniter is disposed to ignite an ignition agent which burns 
gas generating agents. Fig. 2 shows a conventional igniter which is disclosed in 
Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-open Print No. 
108460/1992 for example. In the drawing, the reference numeral 
11 represents a cylindrical igniter holder. At the front of the igniter holder 11, an igniting section 
12 is formed. At the leading end of the igniter holder 11, a cup 13 is 
inserted. And a separator 15 is inserted in the cup 13. In the front side of the separator 15, priming charge 17 is 
accommodated. And in the back side of the separator 15, a charge 
holder 21 is disposed to accommodate an igniting agent 19. And, in the rear opening of the igniter holder 11, a harness 
supporter 23 is inserted with its top ahead and fixed within the 
igniter holder 11 by a caulking section 24 of the igniter 
holder 11. In this harness supporter 23, harnesses 25 are plugged. 
These harnesses 25 are electrically connected with a heater 29  
 
which is disposed in contact with the igniting agent 19 via lead 
terminals 27 of a header 26. In Fig. 2, the reference numeral 31 represents a glass 
sintered member of the header 26, and 33 represents ferrite 
beads. With the igniter configured as described above, when a car 
crashes, electricity is sent to the heater 29 through the 
harnesses 25 and the lead terminals 27. Then the temperature of 
the heater 29 rises to ignite the igniting agent 19 which in turn 
ignites the priming charge 17, causing an ignition agent to burn. But, the above conventional igniter has disadvantages that 
when a charge holder 21 is charged with static electricity, this 
static electricity is discharged from the charge holder 21 to 
lead electrodes 27 and, in the worst case, the igniting agent 
might ignite. Therefore, this igniter is

<CLAIMS>
An igniter comprising: 
   using an insulating member to form an insulated cup for 

accommodating an igniting agent and a header for igniting the 
igniting agent and a harness supporter in which a pair of 

harnesses is inserted with a certain interval therebetween and 
connecting said insulated cup and the harness supporter to form 

an igniter body, 
   forming said header by inserting at a certain interval a pair 

of lead electrodes to whose rear ends said harnesses are 
connected into the header body which is formed by charging a 

glass sintered member into a bottom-closed cylindrical header 
case made of conductive metal, and bridging a heater member 

between the lending ends of the lead electrodes, and 
   electrically conducting one of said lead electrodes to said 

header case. 
An igniter according to Claim 1, wherein said insulating 
member is made of resin or ceramics.
