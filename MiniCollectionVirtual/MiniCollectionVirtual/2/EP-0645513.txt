<ABSTRACT>
The hinge (100) for doors, windows and the like comprises two hinge parts (10, 20) which are connected to one another in the manner of an articulation by a hinge pin. At least one hinge part (10) comprises a fastening part (4) and an articulation part (6) which receives the hinge pin and juts out further from the fastening surface (2) than the fastening part (4). The fastening part (4) can be fastened on the fastening surface (2) by means of fastening screws (3) which can be reached from the front, pass through the fastening part (4), engage vertically into the fastening surface (2) and are designed as cap screws. In order to make the distance between fastening screws (3) and hinge-pin axis (8) as small as possible and to be able to insert the fastening screws (3) obliquely past the articulation part (6), the bores (16) for the fastening screws (3) in the fastening part (4) run slightly obliquely with respect to the hinge part (6) and the fastening surface (2) and exhibit a slight oversize.
