<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the prevention and treatment of
gastric infection in mammals, including humans. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a vaccine suitable for use in the prevention and
treatment of Helicobacter infection in mammals, including humans,
for use in the treatment of humans suffering from gastric infection, its
consequences such as chronic gastritis or peptic ulcer, and prevention of
gastric cancer.Helicobacter infection of human gastric epithelium cause gastritis,
are a major factor in the development of peptic ulcers and gastric
lymphoma, and may be a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer
[1-3]. The most frequent infection agent is Helicobacter pylori, followed at
a much lower frequency by Helicobacter heilmanii. H. pylori is a slender S-shaped
gram negative microorganism, which is routinely recovered from
gastric biopsies of adults and children with histologic evidence of gastritis
or peptic ulceration. Evidence for a causal relationship between H. pylori
and gastroduodenal disease comes from studies in human volunteers,
patients with ulcers and gastric cancer, gnotobiotic pigs, and germ-free
rodents. Regarding etiology, Koch's postulates were satisfied by creating
histologically confirmed gastritis in previously uninfected individuals
following consumption of viable microorganisms [4-11], and by treatment
to eradicate H. pylori, with resolution of the gastritis and, in patients with
peptic ulcer disease, a decrease in the recurrence rate [12].In spite of in vitro susceptibility to many antimicrobial agents, in
vitro eradication of established H. pylori infections with antimicrobial
agents is often difficult to achieve [13]. The microorganism is found within 
the mucous coat overlying the gastric epithelium and in gastric pits. These
are locations which do not appear to allow for adequate antimicrobial levels
to be achieved even when antibiotics are given orally at high doses. At the
present time, most authorities recommend a "triple therapy", namely a
bismuth salt in combination with drugs such as tetracycline and
metronidazole for 2-4 weeks. However, the effectiveness of this or other
chemotherapeutic regimens remains suboptimal. Furthermore, this treatment
may produce serious adverse drug reactions.At the present time little is known regarding the role of the mucosal
immune system in the stomach. The distribution of immunoglobulin (Ig)
producing cells in the normal gastric antrum indicates that IgA plasma cells
make up 80% of the total plasma
