<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic imaging system for displaying color flow images includes a receiver which demodulates ultrasonic echo signals received by a transducer array and dynamically focuses the baseband echo signals. A color flow processor includes a time domain adaptive wall filter which automatically adjusts to changes in frequency and bandwidth of the wall signal components in the focused baseband echo signals. The mean frequency of the resulting filtered baseband echo signals is used to indicate velocity of flowing reflectors and to control color in the displayed image.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COLOR FLOW IMAGING SYSTEM UTILIZING A TIME DOMAIN ADAPTIVE WALL FILTERBackground of the Invent,innThis invention relates to acoustical imaging and, in particular, to the production of color flow images based on the Doppler shift of ultrasonic signals .There are a number of modes in which vibratory energy, such as ultrasound can be used to produce images of objects. The ultrasound transmitter may be placed on one side of the object and the sound transmitted through the object to the ultrasound receiver placed on the other side ("transmission mode") . With transmission mode methods, an image may be produced in which the brightness of each pixel is a function of the amplitude of the ultrasound that reaches the receiver ("attenuation" mode), or the brightness of each pixel is a function of the time required for the sound to reach the receiver ("time- of-flight" or "speed of sound" mode) . In the alternative, the receiver may be positioned on the same side of the object as the transmitter and an image may be produced in which the brightness of each pixel is a function of the amplitude or time-of-flight of the ultrasound reflected from the object back to the receiver ("reflection", "backscatter" or "echo" mode) . The present invention relates to a backscatter method for producing ultrasound images .There are a number of well known backscatter methods for acquiring ultrasound data. In the so- called "A-scan" method, an ultrasound pulse is directed into the object by the transducer and the amplitude of the reflected sound is recorded over a period of time. The amplitude of the echo signal is 

proportional to the scattering strength of the scatterers in the object and the time delay is proportional to the range of the scatterers from the transducer. In the so-called "B-scan" method, the transducer transmits a series of ultrasonic pulses as it is scanned across the object along a single axis of motion. The resulting echo signals are recorded as with the A-scan method and their amplitude is used to modulate the brightness of pixels on a display at the time delay. With the B-scan method, enough data are acquired from which an image of the scatterers can be reconstructed.In the so-called C-scan method, the transducer is scanned across a plane above the object and only the echoes reflecting from the focal depth of the transducer are recorded. The sweep of the electron beam of a CRT display is synchronized to the scanning of the transducer so that the x and y coordinates of the transducer correspond to the x and y
