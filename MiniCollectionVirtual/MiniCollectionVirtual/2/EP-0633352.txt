<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in the regulation 
of the headbox of a paper machine/board machine. 

In the method, an additional flow (Q
3.1
,Q
3.2
...Q
3.n
) 
is introduced into the pulp suspension at different 

points across the width of the headbox, the concentration 
of said additional flow (Q
3.1
,Q
3.2
...Q
3.n
) 
being regulated. The concentration of the additional 

flow is regulated by means of a mixer unit (22), 
which comprises a displaceable distributor part 

(26), whereby, when the mixing ratio is being regulated, 
the flow resistances of the component flows 

(Q₁,Q₂) entering into the mixer unit (22) are 
adjusted by displacing the distributor part (26,260) 

of the mixer unit (22) in the chamber (F) of the 
mixer unit (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a headbox and a method of regulating a headbox of a
paper/board machine, by means of which method and headbox
it is possible to act upon the grammage profile of the paper reliably across
the width of the paper web and favourably also upon the fibre orientation profile in
the paper web across the width of the paper web.As is known from the prior art, the discharge flow of the pulp suspension out of the
headbox must be of uniform velocity in the transverse direction of the paper
machine. A transverse flow, which produces distortion of the fibre orientation,
affects the quality factors of the paper produced, such as the dimensional stability of
the paper in connection with changes in moisture. In particular, it is an important
requirement that the main axes of the directional distribution, i.e. orientation, of the
fibre mesh in the paper coincide with the directions of the main axes of the paper
and that the orientation is symmetric in relation to these axes.At the edges of the pulp-flow duct in the headbox, of course, owing to the vertical
walls, there is a higher friction. This edge effect produces a very strong linear
distortion in the profile. Profile faults in the turbulence generator of the headbox
usually produce a non-linear distortion in the profile inside the lateral areas of the
flow ducts.Attempts are made to compensate for an unevenness of the grammage profile arising
from the drying-shrinkage of paper by means of a crown formation of the slice, so
that the slice is thicker in the middle of the pulp jet. When the paper web is dried,
it shrinks in the middle area of the web to a lower extent than in the lateral areas,
the shrinkage being, as a rule, in the middle about 1...3 % and in the lateral areas
about 4...6 %. Said shrinkage profile produces a corresponding change in the 
transverse grammage profile of the web so that, owing to the shrinkage, the dry
grammage profile of a web whose transverse grammage profile was uniform after
the press is changed during the drying so that, in both of the lateral areas of the
web, the grammage is slightly higher than in the middle area. As is known from the
prior art, said grammage profile has been regulated by means of the profile bar so
that the profile bar of the headbox is kept more open in the middle area than in the
lateral areas. By means of said arrangement, the pulp suspension is forced to move
towards the middle area of the web. Said circumstance further affects the alignment
of the fibre orientation. The main axes of the
