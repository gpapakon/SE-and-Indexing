A device (1) for the measurement, control and/or 
detection of a level of a filling material in a 

container, including a first vibration element (2) 
whose vibrations are damped by contact with filling 

material, whereby the first vibration element (2) 
projects into the container and is of tubular 

configuration, and whereby arranged in the cavity of 
said first tubular vibration element (2) is a second 

rod-shaped vibration element (4) which has the same 
resonance frequency as the first vibration element 

(2) and vibrates in phase opposition thereto, whereby 
the first vibration element (2) is supported at a 

springy diaphragm (7) having a vibration drive (8) 
and a vibration pick-up and the outer diaphragm edge 

is connected to a plate carrying the second rod-shaped 
vibration element, so that the vibration 

elements are connected to form a vibratory system, 

characterized in that
 arranged at the transition from 
the first tubular vibration element (2) to the 

diaphragm (7) carrying the latter is at least one 
stiffening web (10) connecting the diaphragm (7) and 

the first vibration element (2), and that the 
connecting line between the vibration drive (8) and 

the vibration pick-up at the diaphragm (7) extends 
transversely of the stiffening web (10). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the connecting line from the vibration drive (8) to 

the vibration pick-up and hence the vibratory 
movements run horizontally in the position of use. 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that one stiffening web (10)  

 
oriented from top to bottom is provided at the upper 

side and one at the underside of the first vibration 
element (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the two stiffening webs (10) 

are arranged in alignment in a common vertical plane 
which is simultaneously the vertical diametrical 

plane of the outer tubular vibration element (2). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least one of the stiffening 

webs (10) extends to the edge of the diaphragm (7) 
and into the region of tubular mount (9) of the 

diaphragm. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the stiffening web or webs end 

even with the outside of the diaphragm mount (9) or 
project slightly beyond the same. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the stiffening webs (10) are 

flat laminae whose axial extent at the outside of the 
first vibration element (2) corresponds approximately 

to the radial dimension at the diaphragm (7) or is 
larger. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that at the side opposite the 

fastening points, the stiffening web or webs are 
sloped or rounded and the slope is particularly about 

45Â°.  
 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that thickenings of material are 

provided at that side of the diaphragm (7) from which 
the tubular vibration element (2) and the stiffening 

webs (10) depart, beside the stiffening webs (10) 
and/or at the closed end face (11) of the first 

vibration element (2), said thickenings of material 
being wholly or partly removable - for example by 

filing - to adapt the system to the natural 
frequency. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the thickness of the diaphragm 

(7) itself is slighter than is necessary for the 
resonance vibration of the vibration elements (2, 4) 

and is increased by the thickening of material beyond 
the measure necessary for the resonance vibration. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the thickening of material 

takes the form of one or more reinforcing ribs (12) 
which run on the diaphragm particularly in the 

direction of vibration. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the thickening of material at 

the end of the vibrator take(s) the form of (a) 
rib(s) running in the vertical direction. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the thickenings of material or 

ribs (12) on the diaphragm (7) are sloped from their 
greatest cross-sectional dimension towards the 

diaphragm (7) and/or at the end face of the outer 
vibration element are sloped towards the same.  

 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the reinforcing rib (12) runs 

over the horizontal centre of the diaphragm (7).
