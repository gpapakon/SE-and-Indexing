<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds which are dinucleotide analogues or intermediates 
therefor, their preparation and to oligonucleotide analogues incorporating units derived 
from them. For several years there has been interest in structural analogues of natural oligonucleotides 
because of their utility as anti-sense probes for inhibiting gene expression in biological 
systems and as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of viruses such as influenza, herpes and 
HIV, and in the treatment of cancer. Amongst the analogues of recent interest are those in 
which the groups linking the sugar moieties of oligonucleotides are modified by the 
replacement of the 3' and 5' oxy linkages by other linking groups. WO 92/20822 describes oligonucleotide analogues comprising subunits at least some of 
which have the structure
