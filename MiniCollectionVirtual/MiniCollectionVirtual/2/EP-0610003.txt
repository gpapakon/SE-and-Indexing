<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the adequacy of corrosion protection programs applied 
to metal surfaces is disclosed. The method provides a rapid qualitative determination of 

corrosion detection using inexpensive equipment. Generally, the method encompasses: 

a) wetting an absorbent patch capable of retaining a liquid corrosive to a 
metal surface to be tested with such corrosive liquid to obtain a wetted 

patch; 
b) contacting at least a portion of a metal surface to be tested with the wetted 
patch under corrosive conditions; 
c) removing the patch from the metal surface; 
d) comparing the amount of stain present on the surface of the patch with the 
stain present on the surface of a patch having been applied to a metal 

surface having been treated with a known effective corrosion prevention 
treatment and subjected to the same corrosive conditions wherein the 

efficacy of the corrosion protection treatment can be qualitatively 
determined. 
Alternatively, the metal surface exposed when the patch is removed can be 
examined and compared with the metal surface of a material having been properly 

treated with a corrosion preventive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
Determination of the efficacy of corrosion prevention treatments applied to metal 
surfaces is of great importance to industry. The use of metal surfaces which have been 
improperly treated with corrosion prevention coatings lead to short shelf lives of goods 
fabricated using these metals. Cans containing foodstuffs which are improperly treated 
for corrosion protection during the cooking process corrode, and while this condition 
does not bring into direct question the quality of the foodstuff contained in the can, 
goods look unappealing and unappetizing resulting in their removal from store shelves 
and their eventual destruction. Current corrosion testing means are time-consuming and do not offer a rapid 
indication of whether or not metal surfaces, including cans, have been properly treated 
so that they may attain the longest possible shelf life without visible deterioration due to 
corrosion. Examples of current tests employed to determine the effect of corrosion 
prevention treatments include the use of corrosion coupons which are exposed to air (or 
water) for lengthy periods of time and then carefully weighed to determine metal loss. 
The use of apparatus such as Cleveland humidity cabinets which provide high humidity 
environments for the exposure of treated metal surfaces over long periods of time, and 
the exposure of samples of goods being treated to the atmosphere. All of these treatment methods are time-consuming and, as a result of the time 
taken, by the time a defect, or improperly treated specimen is determined, the goods so 
treated have oftentimes been shipped to a customer or further processed. The present invention provides a test method for rapidly determining the efficacy 
of a corrosion prevention treatment on a metal surface on a qualitative basis. The test 
method employed is inexpensive, produces results in time periods ranging from as little 
as seconds to two hours, can be easily carried out without the use of expensive laboratory 
equipment, and provides a reproducible means to determine the efficacy of corrosion 
treatment programs. The basic method of this invention is set forth in the following four steps:  a) contacting under corrosive conditions at least 
a portion of a metal surface to be tested with 
an absorbent patch retaining a liquid corrosive 
to the metal surface; b) removing the patch from the metal surface; c) comparing the amount of stain present on the 
surface of the patch or of the metal surface 
with, respectively, the stain present on the 
surface
