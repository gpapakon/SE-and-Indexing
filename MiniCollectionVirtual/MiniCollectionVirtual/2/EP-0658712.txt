<ABSTRACT>
A manifold gasket of the invention is used for sealing around 
manifold holes of a manifold, wherein at least three manifold holes 

are arranged side by side. The gasket is formed of a first metal 
plate extending around the manifold holes to constitute a manifold 

gasket, and two spacers attached to two longitudinal end portions of 
the plate. The first metal plate includes first holes corresponding 

to the respective manifold holes, and beads situated around the 
respective first holes for sealing therearound. Each spacer 

includes a second hole greater than an outer shape of the bead to 
allow the bead to be situated inside the second hole. The thickness 

of the spacer is less than the height of the bead. Thus, the 
manifold gasket can be securely fixed to an engine part through the 

spacers without creep relaxation of the beads, while the bead not 
surrounded by the spacer absorbs deformation of the manifold by 

heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manifold gasket
with a deformation absorbing mechanism, which can
securely seal around manifold holes without being
substantially affected by expansion and retraction of the
manifold by heat.A manifold attached to an internal combustion engine
is exposed to high temperature by exhaust gas when the
engine is actuated, while the manifold is cooled to an
ambient temperature when the engine is stopped. Namely,
the manifold is expanded and contracted cyclically by
heat of the engine whenever the engine is operated and
stopped. Thus, it is not easy to securely seal around
the manifold holes by a manifold gasket. Also, in case
sealing portions for the adjacent holes of the manifold
gasket are connected together to form one manifold
gasket, the manifold gasket may deform by heat to cause a
sealing problem.A conventional manifold M and a gasket G for use in
four cylinder engine are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The
manifold M is formed of a main portion 10 and four
branched portions 11. Inlet portions 12 of the branched
portions 11 are attached to outlet ports or portions 13
of an engine 14, and are connected together by bolts 15.The branched portions 11 of the manifold M are
united together at the inlet portions 12 by flanges 16 to
facilitate attaching operation of the manifold M to the
engine 14. Also, the gasket G includes sealing portions
17 attached to the inlet portions 12, which are connected
together by flanges 18. The shapes of the sealing
portions 17 and the flanges 18 of the gasket G 
substantially correspond to those of the inlet portion 12
and the flange 16 of the manifold M.When the engine 14 with the manifold M and the
gasket G is actuated, the manifold M is heated to high
temperature by exhaust gas, while the engine 14 is not so
heated due to a cooling system of the engine. Thus, the
flanges 16 of the manifold M expand in the longitudinal
direction, as shown in arrows 19, and the center area of
the manifold M is pushed toward the engine 14, as shown
in an arrow 20. Therefore, the gasket G suffers damages
at the sealing surfaces due to the movement between the
inlet portions 12 and the outlet portions 13 whenever the
engine is operated and stopped, so that the sealing
ability of the gasket G decreases.In order to resolve the problems of the conventional
gasket, a gasket G' as shown in Fig. 3 was proposed in
Japanese Utility Model Publication (KOKAI) No 59-110471.
The gasket G' is formed of an upper plate 21 with spacers
22 at longitudinal ends, a middle plate 23 with
