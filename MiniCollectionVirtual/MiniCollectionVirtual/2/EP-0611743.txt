<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing α-olefin oligomers.
More particularly, it relates to an
industrially advantageous process of preparation of α-olefin
oligomers in which it is possible to produce α-olefin
oligomers principally composed of 1-hexene from
ethylene with high selectivity and in a high yield.Known oligomerization processes of α-olefins such as
ethylene include methods which use a chromium-based
catalyst composed of a specific chromium compound and a
specific organoaluminium compound.
For instance, JP-B-43
18707 discloses a process for producing 1-hexene from
ethylene using a catalyst consisting of a chromium-containing
VIA Group transition metal compound and a
polyhydrocarbylaluminium oxide.Also,
JP-A-3-128904 (EP-A-416304) discloses a method for oligomerizing α-olefins
using a catalyst obtained by reacting a
chromium-containing compound having a chromium-pyrrolyl bond
with an alkyl metal or a Lewis acid. However, according to the process of JP-B-43-18707
(US-A-3347840), the amount of the by-product polyethylene
which is produced with 1-hexene is large, and if the
trimerization reaction is carried out under the conditions
which decrease the yield of the by-product polyethylene, the
catalyst activity is lowered.Also, the method of JP-A-3-128904 (EP-A-416,304) has
the problem that the activity of the catalyst is
unsatisfactory, although the yield of the by-products such as
polyethylene is lowered. Further, in this method, there are
required, in addition to the α-olefin oligomerization
process, a step for preparing a chromium-containing compound
having at least a chromium-pyrrolyl bond from a chromium salt
and metal pyrrolide, and a step for isolating said
chromium-containing compound. Therefore not only does the
oligomerization operation become too complicated but also the
construction cost for the whole process is elevated.
Moreover, it is very difficult to handle the
chromium-containing compounds having at least a
chromium-pyrrolyl bond since they are very unstable to air
and to humidity.The present invention seeks to provide a process for
producing α-olefin oligomers such as 1-hexene with high
selectivity and in a high yield without requiring any
complicated operations.The present invention also seeks to provide an
industrially advantageous process for producing 1-hexene. As a result of the present inventors' earnest
studies in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, it
has been found that by carrying out oligomerization of an
α-olefin in a solvent by reacting the
