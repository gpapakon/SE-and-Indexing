<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
conversion of N2O to nitrogen and oxygen. N2O is a by-product of the nitric acid oxidation 
of alcohols and ketones, for example in the oxidation of 
cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol to adipic acid. N2O is 
also used as an anesthetic especially in minor surgery 
such as tooth extraction. N2O has recently attracted attention as a possible 
atmospheric ozone depletion gas, and effort are therefore 
under way to diminish the amount of N2O that is released 
into the atmosphere. U.S. Patent 4,259,303 to Nakaji et al. discloses 
an apparatus for the treatment or N2O anesthetic waste gas 
by contacting it with a catalyst comprising one or more of 
ferric oxide (Fe2O3), cobalt oxide (CoO), cupric oxide 
(CuO), chromium oxide (Cr2O3), manganese dioxide (MnO2), 
and nickel oxide (NiO). U.S. Patent 4,793,980 to Torobin discloses the 
conversion of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen and oxygen 
using finely divided molecular sieve carbon particles. 
This patent also discloses hollow microsphere catalyst 
supports that may be made of zirconia, and indicates that 
hollow microsphere catalyst supports may be used to 
support various metal oxide catalysts. Among the various 
alternative metal oxides listed are nickel oxide or cobalt 
oxide. The present invention is a process for the 
conversion of N2O to nitrogen and oxygen which comprises 
contacting the N2O with a catalyst consisting essentially 
of nickel oxide and cobalt oxide on a zirconia substrate 
at a temperature of at least 280 degrees C. Preferably 
the ratio of nickel oxide to cobalt oxide in the catalyst  
 
is in the range of 0.5-3/1, and the amount of nickel 
oxide plus the amount of cobalt oxide in the catalyst is 10 to 80% of the total 
weight of the catalyst. The size and shape of the catalyst 
substrate will vary, depending on the volume of gas to be 
treated and the pressure drop. Usually the gas stream 
containing the N2O is heated to a temperature above 280 
degrees C before the gas is contacted with the catalyst. The substrate on which the oxides of nickel and 
cobalt are maintained is critical. Only zirconia is 
satisfactory. Other substrates such as alumina are not 
nearly as effective. Only mixtures of oxides of nickel 
and cobalt are satisfactory. This catalyst initiates the 
decomposition of a lower temperature and the catalyst is 
not deactivated by the exothermic reaction or through more 
cycles. The process of the invention will usually be 
carried out by passing the gas containing the N2O through
