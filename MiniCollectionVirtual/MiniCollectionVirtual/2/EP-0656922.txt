<ABSTRACT>
A waterborne coating composition contains a polymeric film-forming resin in aqueous medium and from about 1 to about 40 percent by weight based on the resin solids of the composition of an oligomeric ester of structure (I), where X is the residue of a polyol after reaction with an acid or an anhydride, R is an organic moiety associated with the acid or anydride and A has an average value of about 2 or greater. The waterborne coating compositions are particularly advantageous as metallic pigmented coating compositions for automotive basecoat applications because they exhibit excellent resistance to mottling, have good flop and have reduced sensitivity to fluctuations in relative humidity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to waterborne coating 
compositions and to methods for the preparation of multi-layered 
coated articles utilizing said compositions and to the resultant 
coated articles. In the coating of substrates such as, for example 
automobiles, where a coating is desired which provided a lustrous 
appearance, it has been well appreciated to provide the substrate with 
several coating layers in order to achieve the desired effect. 
Therefore, typically a pigmented coating composition is first applied 
to the substrate followed by a transparent topcoat. By transparent is 
meant a clear coating, that is one which does not contain pigmentation 
or contains only transparent pigments. Such a coating system is 
commonly referred to as "clear-over-color" or "color plus clear". Automotive coatings containing metallic pigments such as 
aluminum flake are generally utilized to obtain the glossy lustrous 
appearance which is characteristically sought. In order to achieve 
the preferred appearance of such metallic coating compositions it is 
very important that the metallic pigment orient such that it is 
parallel to the coated surface. The alignment of the pigment in this 
fashion provides for the most desirable appearance, especially with 
respect to the "flop" of the coating. By "flop" is meant the visual 
change in brightness or lightness of the metallic aluminum flake with 
a change in viewing angle, that is, a change from 90 to 180 degrees. 
The greater the visual change from light to dark appearance, the 
better the flop. The flop accentuates the lines and curves of an 
automobile; therefore, it is very important in achieving the sought 
after appearance of the coating. It is also very important that the 
metallic pigment be uniformly oriented across the surface of the 
substrate, otherwise blotchy areas of light and dark color will be 
evident. This condition is commonly known as mottling.  
 Over the past several years the trend in the automotive 
industry has been to reduce atmospheric pollution caused by the 
volatile solvents which are emitted during the painting process. One 
approach to emissions control has been the use of waterborne coating 
compositions as the pigmented color coat in the "color plus clear" 
system. Waterborne coating compositions, however, are not without 
attendant disadvantages. For example, such coatings often have a 
narrow application window in which excellent film properties are 
obtained. That is, it is difficult to obtain smooth films, free of 
solvent
