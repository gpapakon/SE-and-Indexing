<ABSTRACT>
The movement detector includes a comparator circuit for comparing the pixels of a luminance half image with the previous luminance half images. A difference signal is produced for each pixel. A threshold circuit generates a movement bit for each pixel or image point after analysing the difference signals in blocks. The movement detector consists of a parallel circuit with multiple signal lines. The detector includes a planar or horizontal LPF (11) for colour carrier suppression in the difference signals. A movement bit is generated for each full image by the difference signal processor.

Movement detector, having

a comparator circuit (4, 10, 11) for the pixel-by-pixel
comparison of the pixels of a luminance

field with those of the previous luminance field,
which comparator circuit makes available a

differential signal for every pixel at its output,
a modulus-forming circuit (12, 16) connected
downstream of the comparator circuit (4, 10, 11)

and
a threshold-value circuit (13, 17) which is
connected downstream of the modulus-forming

circuit (12, 16) and at whose output there is
present for every pixel a movement bit which is

fed to a circuit (14, 15) for the block-by-block
evaluation of the differential signals taking

account of the sign of the differential signals,

characterized in that the movement detector has a
parallel circuit (12, 13, 14; 16, 17, 18) of a

plurality of signal paths which each has a modulus-forming
circuit (12, 16), a threshold-value circuit

(13, 17) and a circuit (14, 18) for the block-by-block
evaluation of the differential signals, both the

thresholds of the threshold-value circuits (13, 17) and
the block sizes chosen in the circuits (14, 18) for the

block-by-block evaluation of the differential signals

being different in each case in the parallel circuit
(12, 13, 14; 16, 17, 18) of the signal paths.
Movement detector according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it has a planar or horizontal low-pass filter

(11) which suppresses colour subcarrier residues in the
differential signals.
Movement detector according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it has an

evaluation circuit (20) which is connected to the 
output of the circuits (14, 18) for the block-by-block

evaluation of the differential signals and makes
available at its output a movement bit for each frame.
Movement detector according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the evaluation circuit (20) has a counting

circuit for counting the blocks indicating a movement.
Movement detector according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the counting circuit counts the number of those

blocks indicating a movement which result from the
comparison of fields of the same frame.
Movement detector according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the evaluation circuit contains, in addition,

counting means which count the number of those blocks
indicating a movement which result from the comparison

of fields of consecutive frames so that picture
material which is derived from film scanning is

reliably detected.
Movement detector according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the movement

detector is used in a device for switching over between
different flicker-reduction methods, which device has


picture storage means (2, 3) into which the
television signals to be processed are written in

with a first vertical frequency and are read out
with a second, higher vertical frequency and
a television signal processing circuit (5) which,
in response to the output signal of the movement

detector, makes available, in a first operating
mode for stationary and slowly moving picture

contents, a large-area flicker-free and line
flicker-free first interlaced signal at the second

vertical frequency and, in a second operating mode
for rapidly moving picture contents, makes 

available a motionally correct, large-area
flicker-free second interlaced signal at the

second vertical frequency, the motionally correct,
large-area flicker-free second interlaced signal

having the second vertical frequency being derived
from an interlaced signal having a first vertical

frequency by field repetition.
Movement detector according to Claim 7, characterized
in that it generates a switchover signal for switching

over between reproduction of a motionally correct
interlaced signal having the second vertical frequency

and reproduction of a line flicker-free interlaced
signal having the second vertical frequency only if a

plurality of consecutive frames are detected as
stationary or slowly moving.
Movement detector according to one of Claims 7 or 8,
characterized in that, after an operating-mode

switchover, the parameters of the threshold-value
circuit (13, 17) and/or the circuit for the block-by-block

evaluation (14, 18) and/or the evaluation circuit
(20) are altered with a view to maintaining the current

operating mode.
