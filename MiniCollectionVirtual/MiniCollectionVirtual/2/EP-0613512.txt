<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to modular building structures.
More particularly, the present invention relates to connector means for modular
building structures, the building structures to be constructed with a plurality of
prefabricated structural components and being particularly adapted for use in
third world countries. Specifically, the present invention relates to a novel
connector means in the nature of an anchor assembly for securing roof panel
members to a wall and a compatible connector means in the nature of a joinder
assembly for securing roof panel members to each other at the ridge of the roof,
the connector means being particularly adapted for use in conjunction a modular
building structure such that the roof may be erected in a relatively short time
with the simplest of tools, and without the need for craftsmen skilled in the
building trades.It is well known in the construction industry that significant economic
savings can be realized by reducing the amount of work required at the
construction site. To achieve this objective, prefabrication has been adopted on a
large scale in the construction industry, both with respect to general purpose
buildings and with respect to personal housing. For example, some sources have
estimated that as many as forty percent (40%) of the homes now being built use
some form of pre-manufactured structural components. Moreover, four and
seven-tenths percent (4.7%) of all housing starts in the U.S. in 1991 are homes
that are completely modular, and this percentage is expected to rise. The
ultimate goal to be achieved in building modular structures has been to produce,
at a remote site and in a factory environment, as many of the components of a
given structure as possible, leaving only site preparation and final assembly to be
done at the actual location where the building is to be situated. There are a number of advantages to be achieved by prefabrication.
The most obvious of those advantages is the significant reduction of time and
labor required at the job site, where labor costs are normally the highest. In
addition to the reduced time required for actual erection of the building, other
time savings are also possible. For example, the reduced amount of work time at
the job site reduces the potential for interruptions resulting from inclement
weather. Reduced time at a job site can also drastically reduce the potential for
work-related injuries and/or deaths. A controlled factory atmosphere is
inherently amenable to measures for reducing injuries

A connector means for securing a hollow rectilinear
roof panel (45) to a hollow rectilinear wall member (11,13),

said connector comprising a cap (60) having a base (61) to
seat on the top (74,75,76,78) of a hollow rectilinear wall

member (11,13) and having downwardly extending flanges
(71,72) to embrace the opposite faces (26,28,32,34) of such

a wall member (11,13), said cap (60) having an inclined
plate portion (65) for supporting a hollow rectilinear roof

member (45), said base (61) and said inclined plate portion
(65) having registering openings (66,68) therethrough, an

anchor dowel (55) having locating means (90,92) for
interengagement with walls of a hollow wall member (11,13)

on which said cap (60) is adapted to seat, said anchor dowel
(55) being adapted to be mounted to extend upwardly through

said base and inclined plate portion openings (66,68) and
into the interior of a hollow roof member (45) to be

supported and down into a hollow wall member (11,13) on
which said cap (60) is adapted to seat, said anchor dowel

(55) being provided with stop means (52) at the upper end
thereof, and a bifurcated wedge member (95) for sliding

wedging engagement under said anchor dowel stop means (52)
for clamping a hollow roof member (45) to the inclined plate

portion (65) of said end cap (60).
A connector means as claimed in Claim 1, provided with
means (96,104) to resist movement of said wedge member (95)

out of wedge clamping position.
A connector means as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, in
which said anchor dowel locating means (90,92) is provided

with means (91) to support same from the upper edge
(74,75,76,78) of a hollow wall member (11,13). 
A connector means as claimed in Claim 1, Claim 2 or
Claim 3, in which said anchor dowel (55) has an array

(86,88) of lateral extensions (90,92) for location within a
hollow wall member (11,13) below the top thereof.
An assembly securing one or more hollow rectilinear

roof panels to at least one wall of a modular building
structure, said assembly comprising a plurality of hollow

rectilinear wall panel members (11), said wall panel members
(11) being linearly conjoined by a hollow rectilinear panel

connector (13) to form a wall of the modular building
structure, an anchor dowel (55) received in the interior of

said panel connector (13), an end cap (60) having a base
portion (61) resting on the upper extent of the panel

members (11) and the panel connector (13), at least one
hollow rectilinear roof panel member (45), said roof panel

member (45) having a central cavity (80) bounded by opposed
generally planar skin walls (46,48), said central cavity

(80) being accessible from at least one end of the roof
panel (45) and through an aperture (51) penetrating one of

the skin walls (46,48), said end cap (60) also having an
inclined plate portion (65) upon which at least one said

roof panel (45) is supported, means (86,88) to secure said
anchor dowel (55) against movement relative to the cavity of

said panel connector (13) within which said anchor dowel is
received, said anchor dowel (55) projecting upwardly through

said end cap (60), said anchor dowel (55) having a stop
means (52) presented upwardly of said plate means (65) in

said cap end (60) and being received through said aperture
(51) in the roof panel (45), a bifurcated wedge member (95)

inserted wedgedly between said stop means (52) and that skin
wall (48) of the roof panel (45) penetrated by the aperture

(51) to clamp said roof panel member (45) to said plate
portion (65) of said end cap (60). 
An assembly as claimed in Claim 5, wherein said anchor
dowel means (55) further comprises upper and lower

positioning arrays (86,88), said upper positioning array
(86) interacting with the interior cavity of said panel

connector (13) on which said end cap (60) is received; and
said lower array (88) providing means (92,93) by which to

connector (13).
An assembly as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the upper
array on said anchor dowel means further comprises at least

one pair of opposed, individual arms (90) extending
