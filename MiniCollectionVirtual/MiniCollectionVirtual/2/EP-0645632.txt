<ABSTRACT>
A boron estimating method in which a plurality of 
reference samples shallowly ion-implanted with boron in 

different dosages are prepared and heat-treated under the 
same conditions in temperature and time as a bonding heat 

treatment achieved to obtain the bonded wafer, thereafter, 
the boron profile in the direction of the depth of the 

bonding interface in each reference sample is measured using 
the SIMS and compared with an actual boron profile at the 

bonding interface of a bonded wafer to be estimated so 
as to determine one reference sample whose boron profile is 

equivalent to the actual boron profile of the bonded wafer 
to be estimated, and finally a dosage of boron in the 

determined reference sample is estimated by conversion to be 
a surface density of boron present at the bonding interface 

of the bonded wafer to be estimated at an initial 
stage prior to the bonding heat treatment of the bonded 

wafer to be estimated. Thus, the boron profile obtained 
by the SIMS measurement can be converted into the boron 

surface density with the result that the boron quantity at 
the bonding interface of a bonded wafer can be readily 

estimated to be a boron surface density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of estimating
the quantity of boron presenting an impurity at
the bonding interface of a bonded wafer, in terms of the
surface density of boron.Bonded wafers are generally classified into two
groups depending on the type of bonding: one group being a
direct bonding type wafer in which two semiconductor wafers
are directly bonded without an insulator between them, and
the other group being a so-called SOI (Semiconductor On
Insulator) type wafer in which a semiconductor wafer and an
insulator wafer such as oxidized wafers are bonded together.Regarding the direct bonding type wafer, when two
wafers to be bonded are comprised of mirror-polished, single-crystalline
silicon wafers (hereinafter referred to as
"Si wafers"), a pair of mirror-polished surfaces of the Si
wafers are placed in contact with each other, and after that
the superposed Si wafers are heat-treated at a temperature
above several hundred degrees to create the strong bonding
interface of these two Si wafers. The bonded wafer thus
fabricated is equivalent to an epitaxial wafer.In the fabrication of the SOI type wafer, when two
wafers to be bonded are comprised of Si wafers, a silicon
dioxide (SiO2) film is formed on the surface of at least one 
of two mirror-polished Si wafers. Then, the two Si wafers
are superposed, with the SiO2 film disposed between a pair
of mirror-polished surfaces of the Si wafers, and heat-treated
at a temperature above several hundred degrees to
thermally bond the Si wafers. After the bonding heat treatment,
the bonded wafer is thinned by grinding and polishing
the surface of the insulator wafer including the SiO2 film.
Likewise, a silicon on quartz wafer can be also fabricated.Bonded wafers are fabricated in a well-controlled
clean room. However, since wafers which are cleaned and
dried are exposed to air as they are standing by before
bonding at room temperature, boron existing in a very small
amount in air is adsorbed on wafer surfaces. The thus
adsorbed boron may be trapped at the bonding interface in a
bonded wafer.The bonding interface is a region where mirror-polished
surfaces of two wafers are directly bonded together
in face to face relation. On a heat treatment for thermal
bonding, the boron impurity trapped at the bonding interface
diffuses into the Si single crystal layer while it is unlikely
to diffuse into the SiO2 insulator layer.Accordingly, in the case of the above-mentioned
bonded wafer equivalent to the epitaxial wafer, the boron
impurity diffuses into both
