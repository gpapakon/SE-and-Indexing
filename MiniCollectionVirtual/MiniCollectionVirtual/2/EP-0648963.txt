<ABSTRACT>
A single-handle mixing valve for mixing cold and hot water has a cold-water inlet opening and a hot-water inlet opening and an outlet opening for the mixed water and is provided with a flat seal comprising a fixed inlet disc (1) and a control disc (2) which can be moved by means of a control lever. The quantity of water flowing through can be controlled by means of a radial movement of the control disc (2) while the mixing ratios can be controlled by a rotation of the control disc (2). To widen the comfort zone, the inlet disc (1) has at least two cold-water inlets (11, 12) and at least two hot-water inlets (13, 14), both the cold-water inlets (11) and the hot-water inlets (13, 14) being connected by distributor passages (16, 17) on the water-inlet side of the inlet disc (1). The control disc (2) has at least two control openings (21, 22), which are connected to one another by the mixing space (7).

Single-lever mixer valve for mixing cold and warm 
water with a cold water and a warm water inlet 

opening as well as an outlet opening for the 
mixed water, and with a gasket consisting of a 

fixed inlet disc (1) and a control disc (2) that 
can be moved via a control lever, the control disc 

(2) having at least two control openings (21, 22) 
which are connected with one another by a mixing 

area, and the amount of water flowing through 
being controlled by moving the control disc (2) 

radially, and the mixing proportions being 
controlled by turning the control disc (2), 

characterised in that the inlet disc (1) has at 
least two cold water inlets (11, 12) and at least 

two warm water inlets (13, 14), both the cold 
water inlets and the warm water inlets being 

connected by distributor ducts (16,17) on the 
water inlet side of the inlet disc (1). 
Mixer valve according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the discs (1, 2) of the gasket consist of 

ceramic oxide. 
Mixer valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the inlets (11, 12, 13, 14) 

of the inlet disc are limited by the same radii 
(r, R), and the control edges (25, 26) of the 

control disc (2) have these radii (r, R). 
Mixer valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the arc length of one of the  

 
cold and warm water inlets (12, 14) of the inlet 

disc (1) is approximately a third of the arc 
length of the other cold and warm water inlets 

(11, 13) and that the width of one of the control 
openings (22) of the control disc (2) is equal to 

the distance of one of the cold and warm water 
inlets (12, 14) from one another. 
Mixer valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the arc length of one of the 

cold and warm water inlets (12, 14) of the inlet 
disc (1) is approximately equal to the arc length 

of the other cold and warm water inlets (11, 13) 
and that the width of one of the control openings 

(22) of the control disc (2) is equal to the 
distance of one of the cold and warm water inlets 

(12, 14) from one another, the distance between 
the cold water inlets (11, 12) or between the warm 

water inlets (13, 14) exceeding this value by 
approximately 1.5 mm.
