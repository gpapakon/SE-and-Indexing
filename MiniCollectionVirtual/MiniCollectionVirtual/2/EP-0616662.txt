<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aircraft engines and in 
particular to an acceleration schedule control system 
for such engines. Gas turbine engines are operated in response to a 
demand input. The input demand modifies the fuel flow 
producing a change in the engine output. Various known 
control limits place limits on the range of operation 
and the rate of load change. Adequate compressor surge margin is provided and 
the engine material is protected from extreme 
temperature levels. During a load change thermal 
transients occur. When part of the engine responds 
thermally, more rapidly than other parts, differential 
expansion occurs. This can produce rubbing or thermal 
stresses in connecting structure. A rapid temperature change causes the exposed 
surface of a component to expand before the rest of the 
component. This leads to thermal stresses within the 
component during the transient. Generally there is no 
immediate failure, but fatigue damage occurs as a 
function of the extent of the strain and the number of 
cycles. The aircraft and engine must meet specified 
response time performance for certification and safe 
operation. The engine is designed and/or selected to 
meet these requirements while maintaining a long 
operating life. It is sometimes desirable to provide an 
even more rapid response of the engine and aircraft for 
certain conditions. The prior art approach of changing the preselected  
 
acceleration schedule to a higher schedule meets this 
need see e.g. EP-A-0277904 and EP-A-0095434. 
However, this leads to the use of the more rapid 
schedule all of the time. A more rapid response 
increases the thermal stress for each cycle. Since this 
prior art response now occurs for all operating 
conditions, the number of extreme cycles increases to 
significantly reduce engine hot section life. A basic acceleration schedule limits response of 
the engine for all normal conditions, but meets 
certification regulations and provides safe operation. 
During landing approach it would be desirable to quickly 
correct a glide path error. If a go-around is required, 
it would also be desirable to have a more rapid 
response. A second more rapid acceleration schedule is 
provided. Control restrictions permit the intercession 
of this schedule only in the approach and the go-around 
conditions. A first acceleration schedule is provided and also 
a second acceleration schedule which establishes a 
higher permitted engine acceleration than the first 
schedule. An approach conditions satisfied signal
