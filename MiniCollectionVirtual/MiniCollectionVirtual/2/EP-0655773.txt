<ABSTRACT>
A mask having features of a smaller size than a 
lithographically defined image width is formed by 

depositing a first layer of a different material from 
the underlying material to be treated through the 

openings of the mask. This first layer is lithographically 
patterned and thereafter a conformally 

deposited second layer is anisotropically etched, thus 
leaving residues on vertical definition walls of the 

first layer. The mask openings are restricted to a 
controllably reduced width as compared with the width 

of the lithographically defined window. Empirical 
relationships between the thicknesses of the deposited 

layers and the reduction of the lithographic image size 
that is achieved provide a good dimensional control of 

the mask openings that are finally produced, adequate 
for sub-micron line-width processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
forming windows having a width that is smaller than the 
minimum width that can be defined lithographically by 
the apparatuses being used for the purpose. An unrelented reduction of the size of single 
structures in IC is constantly sought through 
refinements of the apparatuses and of the methods of 
lithographic definition of "windows" and "islands", 
through certain layers that are successively stacked, 
by depositing or otherwise forming them, over a wafer 
of a semiconducting material. By the use of the most advanced lithographic 
technologies, often using a reduced wavelength 
radiation, for example x-rays or electron beams, for 
exposing one or more layers of a photoresist that, 
after developing and eventual hardening treatment, will 
constitute a mask through which a dry etching or any 
other treatment Of an underlying layer will be 
performed, a large scale production of IC with a 
minimum definition line-width of about 0.6 µm, has been 
made possible. It is evident from considerations on 
usable wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation used 
for exposing the photoresist, on diffraction phenomena 
and on exposition characteristics of the resist used, 
that the reduction of the minimum image size implies 
ever more important investments for the development of 
extremely sophisticated lithographic techniques. Methods have been proposed for reducing the size of 
a lithographically produced image in order to extend 
the possibility of reduction beyond the minimum 
lithographically definable width.  The document US-A-4.707,218, discloses one of said 
methods for reducing the lithographic image size. The 
method consists in forming over a substrate to be 
patterned, a thin release layer, composed of a material 
that may be easily lifted off the substrate by etching 
or by combustion in an oxygen plasma. Over such a 
release layer, typically of a photoresist hardened by 
heat treatment or by exposition to UV radiation, a 
layer of a photosensitive resist is deposited to be 
lithographically defined in order to produce a mask 
with apertures having a width that may be the minimum 
width that is definable by the lithographic apparatuses 
used. After having stabilized the defined layer of 
resist, the width of the windows is reduced by 
conformally depositing a layer of oxide having an 
appropriate thickness and by anisotropically etching it 
in plasma in order to leave residues of oxide having a 
thickness substantially similar to the thickness of the
