<ABSTRACT>
A method of recovering reusable foam particles from a molded product of foam particles which is manufactured by using 
foam particles coated with a thermoplastic resin having a melting point lower than that of the synthetic resin constituting the 

foam particles, or a solubility different from that of the same synthetic resin, comprising the steps of heating the thermoplastic 
resin so as to soften or melt the same or dissolving the thermoplasti
c resin in a solvent, so as the reduce the bonding strength of 
the foam particles, and separating the foam particles from the molded product by applying a shearing force to the molded product 

in such a bonding strength-reduced state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recovering 
expanded particles from an expanded particle moldings 
comprising expanded particles 
of a synthetic resin coated with a thermoplastic resin. 
The expanded particles comprise polyolefin and the 
like. Recyclable expanded particles are recovered from 
moldings produced thereof by the steps comprising melting, 
softening or dissolving the interfacial material and 
separating into individual particles. Expanded particles of synthetic resins such as 
polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene are molded in 
various forms and widely used as packing medium, cushioning 
medium and insulation. After being used, expanded particle 
moldings are generally crushed with a crusher and then burnt 
up or buried under the ground. When the resins are burnt up, 
environmentally harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon 
dioxide are generated in a large amount, and resins 
including chloride and nitrogen generate various types of 
gases poisonous to living beings. Also, it is necessary to 
secure land to bury crushed resins under the ground. For the 
purpose of recycling the crushed resins, expanded particle 
moldings produced from the same resin must be collected. It 
requires a great deal of labor to select resins. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 83145/1988 and  
 
119687/1977 disclose a process for recovering recyclable resin 
chips from expanded particle moldings. The process comprises 
crushing expanded particle moldings comprising, for example, 
polystyrene or polyethylene, heat-melting the crushed expanded 
particle moldings to remove gas generated from the particles 
present in the melted resin, extruding the melted resin in 
a filament form and cutting the extruded resin into proper 
sizes. The recovered resin chips, however, have the drawbacks 
in that moldings of good quality cannot be produced therefrom 
because the resin chips have lost, in the recovering process, 
their suitable properties for expansion due to deterioration 
during heating and mixing of foreign substances therewith. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 278939/1991 and 
German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,462,040 disclose a process for 
mechanically separating expanded particles from expanded particle 
moldings of polystyrene or polyethylene and the like in 
a crusher. According to this process, expanded particle 
moldings are directly crushed by mechanical force. As a 
result, the recovered expanded particles tend to be mechanically 
damaged. Moreover, in this
