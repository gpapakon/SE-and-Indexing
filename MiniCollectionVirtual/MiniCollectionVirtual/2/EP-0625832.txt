<ABSTRACT>
It is known that detection labels and reading devices are used for the contactless identification of people or objects. If the detection label is brought into the vicinity of the reading device (12), the latter can receive and evaluate the data sent out by the detection label using an antenna. To provide for the greatest possible distance between the reading device (12) or the antenna, respectively, and the detection label in practice, the reading device (12) has an automatic tuning unit (L2,C4...C8), by means of which the resonant circuit of the antenna (28) of the reading device can automatically tune to the predetermined resonant frequency. This acts in opposition to external influences which, when the reading device (12) or the associated antenna is installed, for example, in a wall or in a roadway, lead to a detuning of the resonant circuit of the antenna (28), originally tuned to the resonant frequency, and would necessitate a relatively short reading distance due to the detuning of the resonant circuit of the antenna.
