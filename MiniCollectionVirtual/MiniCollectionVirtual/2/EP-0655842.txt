<ABSTRACT>
A variable length code (VLC) decoding apparatus for 
decoding sequential variable length codewords includes a 

second barrel shifter cascaded to a first barrel shifter for 
providing a second table memory device with a decoding window 

output sequence which is directly shifted in response to a 
codeword length output from a first table memory device so 

that the first bit in the decoding window output sequence is 
the first bit of the next variable length codeword in a 

decoding window output sequence from the first barrel shifter; 
and the second table memory device for producing a fixed 

length codeword in response to each variable length codeword 
in the second decoding window output sequence, to thereby 

decode, at each clock cycle, consecutively two variable length 
codewords without an operational delay in an accumulator for 

shifting the decoding window of the first barrel shifter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable length 
code(VLC) decoding apparatus; and, more particularly, to an 
improved VLC decoding apparatus which is capable of providing 
a high speed decoding operation by effectively reducing the 
operational delay of an accumulator contained therein. Variable length coding is a technique often used for 
lossless data compression. This technique is used to convert 
fixed-length data to variable-length codewords based on the 
statistical occurrences of the data. The length of the 
codewords is chosen in such a manner that shorter codewords 
are used to represent more frequently occurring data and 
longer codewords are selected to represent less frequently 
occurring data. By properly assigning the variable-length 
codewords to a library of all possible source codewords, the 
average word length of the variable-length codewords becomes 
shorter than that of the original data, thereby rendering it 
possible to achieve data compression. In this connection, Huffman code design is a procedure  
 
commonly used to construct a minimum redundant variable length 
code for a known data statistic. In general, the encoding 
process can be implemented by using a table-lookup process 
using input data to address the table. The codewords and the 
word-length information are stored as contents of the table 
and outputted sequentially through the use of a buffer at a 
constant data rate onto the data channel. At the receiving end, however, the decoding process is 
more complicated. Owing to the variable length nature, each 
codeword has to be segmented from the received bit string 
before it can be decoded into a source symbol. Therefore, the 
design of a variable word length decoder is more difficult 
than that of a variable length encoder. There are several known apparatus for use to decode a 
stream of variable length codewords. Among them, most often 
used is a VLC decoder employing a tree-searching algorithm 
such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,149 issued on 
Feb. 6, 1990 to Gary Kahan. In this device, a variable length 
code is represented by a tree with codewords as leaves(also 
called terminal nodes). The decoding process starts from the 
root of the code tree and is guided by the received bit stream 
to follow one of two branches at each node. When a leaf is 
reached, the end of a codeword is detected and is segmented 
from the remaining bit stream. This type of decoding 
apparatus includes a logic circuitry corresponding to the tree 
and a control circuitry

<CLAIMS>
A variable length code decoding apparatus for decoding, 
at a fixed clock rate, sequential variable length codewords 

supplied from an input buffer which stores an input bit stream 
to be decoded in fixed length segments having the length equal 

to the longest length of the variable length codewords, said 
apparatus comprising: 

   first and second bit storage means, in response to a read 
signal, for storing consecutively two fixed length segments 

from the input buffer; 
   first decoder shift means connected to the first and the 

second bit storage means and having a first decoding window 
for producing a first decoding window output sequence of the 

two fixed length segments, the bit length of the first 
decoding window output being equal to the longest length of 

the variable length codewords and said first decoding window 
being shifted in direct response to a window control signal; 

   first memory means coupled to the first decoder shift 
means for producing a fixed length codeword in response to a 

variable length codeword that begins at the first bit position 
of the first decoding window output sequence and for producing 

a first codeword length output corresponding to the decoded 
variable length codeword; 

   second decoder shift means connected to said first 
decoder shifter means and having a second decoding window for 

 
producing a second decoding window output sequence from bits 

contained in the first decoding window output sequence and a 
predetermined fixed length segment, the bit length of the 

second decoding window output being equal to the longest 
length of the variable length codewords and said decoding 

window being shifted in direct response to the first codeword 
length output so that the first bit position in the second 

decoding window output sequence is the first bit position of 
a next variable length codeword to be decoded in the first 

decoding window output sequence; 
   second memory means for producing a fixed length codeword 

in response to said next variable length codeword and for 
producing a second codeword length output corresponding to the 

decoded next variable length codeword; and 
   accumulator means for adding the first and the second 

codeword length outputs to produce an added codeword length 
output and for adding, at each clock, the added codeword 

length output to a previously accumulated codeword length 
output in order to produce the window control signal 

indicating the added and accumulated codeword length, said 
accumulator generating the read signal to retrieve a next 

fixed length segment stored in the input buffer when said 
added and accumulated codeword length is greater than the 

longest length of the variable length codewords, said next 
fixed length segment being stored in the first bit storage 

means and the fixed length segment previously stored in the 
 

first bit storage means being transferred to the second bit 
storage means.
