<ABSTRACT>
Spray gun for electrostatic spray coating of objects, 
namely for a powder coating material, comprising a gun 

barrel (1) including a high voltage generator, topped in a 
replaceable nozzle (2), and a grip or support member (10, 

11), a duct (14) for the coating material circulation, 
extending along said barrel and grip or support, and 

electrodes (17) connected to said high voltage generator 
and interposed to the passage of the product to spray. 
According to the invention the spray gun is composed 
of a tubular element (6), acting as support of the barrel 

body (1), said element (6) being laterally extended by a 
portion (7) continued by a grip (10) or a supporting 

member (11) fastened to an automatic handler member, and 
said element (6) receiving, tightly inserted, a rear part 

(5) of the barrel (1), of smaller section, lengthwise 
delimited by a step (18) and topped by an end configuration 

(19) adapted to fasten a detachable part (8) which keeps 
linked the two bodies support (6) and barrel (1). The 

tubular support section comprises some passages to insert 
therethrough some ducts (16, 46) to supply powder and fluid 

and electrical current.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spray gun for
electrostatic spray coating, namely for a powder coating
material, of the type which comprises a gun barrel ended in
a replaceable nozzle, and a grip or supporting member,
whose barrel gun integrates a high voltage generator,
constituted by a voltage multiplying circuit and a
transformer, and a duct, generally axial, for the coating
material circulation, a material such as powder paint
driven by a pressurized fluid, which extends along said gun
barrel and grip or support, formed by several coupled
tubular lengths, which may be detached and replaceable, to
make production tasks easier (more plain molding of the gun
body in electrically insulating material), cleaning,
servicing and repair and, namely making easier the change
of colour of the paint used, said spray gun embodying
likewise electrodes connected to said high voltage
generator and interposed to the passage of the product to
spray.A gun of said characteristics appears disclosed in the
utility model nÂº 264,765 owned by the applicant, whose main
and more significant characteristic lays in allowing a
quick mounting and dismounting, with the possibility of
replacing the main elements should any fault arise. For
such aim, in said gun, an assembly is proposed wherein the
voltage multiplying circuit and the transformer are formed
by means of modules which are independent and replaceable,
which are housed in the interior of a tubular body or
housing which constitutes the gun barrel. The duct for
impelling the powder may likewise be detached and is formed
of two replaceable tubular elements, which are coupled
through an elbow which extends along said gun barrel and
the grip, respectively.Although the solution proposed in said utility model
is effective, bearing in mind that the voltage multiplying
circuit is constituted by an insulating cylindric block 
which is axially socketed in a housing of the housing-barrel,
stopping in an end narrowing of said housing
through which it sets an electrical connection by means of
contact stems with the electrodes, it results that in said
connection area as the air always remains trapped and
because of the high voltage existing there, there is the
risk that said contact stems are corroded, with a further
defaulting passage of the current (sparkling) which, with
time can cause that the electrically insulating housing has
a hole, of a smaller thickness at such end part of the
barrel, setting the assembly out of order.On the other hand, in the EP-A 0110753, improvements
are

Spray gun for electrostatic spray coating of
objects, namely for a powder coating material, of the type

which comprises a gun barrel (1) ended in a replaceable
nozzle (2), and a grip or support (10, 11), whose barrel

gun includes a high voltage generator, constituted by a

voltage multiplying circuit (12) and a transformer, and a
duct (14), generally axial, for the coating material

circulation, a material such as powder paint driven by a
pressurized fluid, which extends along said gun barrel and

grip or support, formed by several coupled tubular lengths
(15, 16), which may be detached and replaceable, and some

electrodes (17) connected to said high voltage generator
and interposed to the passage of the product to spray,


characterized
 in that the spray gun is composed of a
tubular section element (6), acting as support of the

barrel body (1) which laterally extends in a portion (7)
which, in turn, is continued by a grip (10) or in a

supporting member (11) fastened to an automatic handler
member, said tubular section element (6) receiving ,

tightly set, a rear part (5) of the barrel (1), having a
slightly smaller section, lengthwise delimited by an

annular step (18) and topped by an end configuration (19)
adapted to allow fastening a detachable part (8) which

keeps linked the two bodies tubular section element (6) and
barrel (1), said tubular section element comprising some

passages to insert therethrough some ducts to supply powder
and fluid (16), and electrical current (46)
Spray gun, according to claim 1, characterized in
that the rear portion (5) of the barrel (1) comprises a

cylindric terminal part (19) having a smaller section,
which is internally threaded and the part (8) which keeps
