<ABSTRACT>
A mounting member (5) fixed to an engine and a mounting 
member (1) fixed to a vehicle body are inter
connected by a 
hollow elastomeric block (2) which has a variable-volume 

primary fluid chamber (13) defined therein. A subsidiary fluid 
chamber (7) having a diaphragm (4) on a portion of an outer wall (5) 

thereof communicates with the primary fluid chamber (13) through 
two fluid passages (21,22). A movable plate (12) forming a portion of 

the outer wall (8) of the primary fluid chamber (13) is connected to 
a voice coil motor (14), and by one example, is driven at the 

same phase as a vibration applied from the engine. During a 
normal traveling, both the fluid chambers (13,7) communicate with 

each other through the fluid passage (21,22) having a smaller 
length. During idling or during a low speed traveling, a 

switch-over valve (20) is operated to permit both the fluid 
chamber to be put into communication with each other 

through the fluid passage (21,22) having a larger length. With the 
above construction, it is possible to stably exhibit the 

performance of the vibration-isolating mount device (M) in a 
wide frequency region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration-isolating
mount device
for mounting an engine to vehicle frame, according to the preamble of claim 1.A vibration-isolating mount device is
conventionally known from Japanese Utility Model
Publication No.39481/92. With the above device, a vibration
transmitted to a vehicle body through a fluid pressure
generated in a primary fluid chamber can be attenuated by applying,
to the movable plate provided in the primary fluid chamber,
a vibration of a predetermined phase against a vibration
received from an engine.Fig.21 illustrates characteristics of the above prior
art vibration-isolating mount device, wherein a fluid
column resonance characteristic of a fluid passage 
interconnecting the primary fluid chamber and a subsidiary
fluid chamber is set such that a large difference in phase
between the input and the displacement is produced in a
particular frequency region of 8 Hz to 15 Hz, thereby
enhancing the damping performance to improve the riding
comfort performance against a shake or the like.However, if the liquid column resonance characteristic
is set in the above manner, there is a problem that the
phase characteristic and the spring constant of the
vibration-isolating mount device are suddenly varied in the
particular region, resulting in an unstable vibration
control by the movable plate provided in the primary fluid
chamber, and in a reduced performance of the vibration-isolating
mount device during idling or during a low speed
traveling.There is also another problem that when the movable
plate is stuck, or the actuator for the movable plate is
failed during the idling or during the low speed traveling,
an effect of damping the vibration of the engine is reduced,
resulting in a degraded riding comfort.A vibration-isolating mount device according to the preamble of
claim 1 is known from EP 0 536 761 A1. This known device
comprises a main fluid chamber and an auxiliary fluid chamber and
a plate member which is displaceably mounted in the main fluid
chamber. The arrangement comprising the fluid chambers is
supported by means of spacing changing means on the basis.
Between the respective fluid chambers there are arranged fluid
passage means allowing the flow of fluid between the main fluid
chamber and the auxiliary fluid chamber. From ATZ Automobiltechnische Zeitschrift 95 (1993), pages 174 to 179, it is also
known that a vibration-isolating mount device may comprise two
chambers being in fluid communication. This document further
discloses that the dampening
