Acidic catalysts obtainable by reaction of short-chain 
triglycerides corresponding to formula 
(I)
 
in which R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 independently of one another represent 
alkyl radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 

with sulfur trioxide. 
A process for the production of acidic catalysts, in 
which short-chain triglycerides corresponding to formula 


(I)
 
in which R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 independently of one another represent 
alkyl radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 

are reacted with sulfur trioxide. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
triglycerides corresponding to formula 
(I)
, in which R
1
, R
2
 
and R
3
 are methyl radicals, are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the triglycerides and the sulfur trioxide are used in a 

molar ratio of 1:0.5 to 1:3.3. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the reaction is carried out at 10 to 80Â°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the reaction is carried out continuously in a falling-film 

reactor. 
The use of the acidic catalysts claimed in claim 1 for 
the production of alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides  

 
corresponding to formula 
(II)
 
in which 


R

carbon atoms, 
G
is a sugar unit containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms and 
p
is a number of 1 to 10.

the production of fatty alcohol polyalkylene glycol ethers 

corresponding to formula 
(IV)
 
in which 


R
