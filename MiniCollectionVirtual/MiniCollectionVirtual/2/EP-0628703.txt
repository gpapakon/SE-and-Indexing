<ABSTRACT>
Variable timing device for controlling an inlet or exhaust valve of an internal combustion engine comprising two operating cams carried by the same camshaft and the profile of one of which lies within the profile of the other, first and second rocker levers (1, 2) mounted side by side on one and the same shaft (29) and interacting with the said cams, it being possible for the second lever (2) to be coupled selectively by means of coupling means (3) to obtain a greater valve lift, characterised in that the said shaft (29) is mounted so that it can slide axially and interacts with controlled operating means (18) for entraining the said coupling means (3) and thus altering the lift law of the valve, adapting it to the operating conditions of the engine.
