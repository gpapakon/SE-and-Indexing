<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sensitive transducer array in which a plurality of transducers 
are connected in series and in parallel with one another. In one embodiment, 

a resistive layer (18) is formed from carbon or silver ink on a polyester 
film (14). A plurality of conductive shunt elements (30, 32) having greater 

conductivity than the resistive layer is formed on a second polyester film 
(12). The films are placed adjacent to one another with the shunt elements 

contacting the resistive layer. Voltage is applied across the resistive 
layer and pressure is applied thereto. As the pressure increases, the number 

of current paths set up through contact points on the shunt elements increase 
thereby decreasing the resistance across the resistive layer and increasing 

current flow. In another embodiment a plurality of plate elements are 
contained in a plane on one side of a dielectric layer. A plurality of plate 

elements are contained in a plane on the other side of the dielectric layer. 
As the layer is pushed together responsive to force applied, total 

capacitance as measured across the planes of plate elements varies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sensing the level of a first form of 
energy and converting it to a corresponding value in a second form of energy and 
more particularly to doing so with an array of transducers. When measuring a given phenomenon, for example measuring pressure with a 
transducer which converts a change in pressure to a related change in electrical 
resistance, it is desirable that the conversion be smooth and repeatable. In many 
applications, such as pressure operated controls or process sensors, a linear transducer 
response is also desirable. Prior art transducers have a number of inherent disadvantages. Several 
methods have been developed in the prior art to compensate for the disadvantages. 
For example, electrical circuits are used to filter noise, to average signals which 
waiver over time and to linearize the response of the transducer. Such circuits add 
expense, as well as limitations of their own, to the combined response of the 
transducer and associated compensating circuitry. U.S. Patent No. 4,314,227 to Eventoff discloses an electronic pressure 
sensitive transducer which produces a decreasing resistance responsive to increasing 
pressure applied to the transducer. In Eventoff, two sets of relatively conductive 
contact fingers are interleaved with one another. The interleaved fingers are pressed  
 
against a less conductive facing layer. So doing forms a plurality of parallel 
connections between the two sets of interleaved fingers through the resistive surface. 
When the pressure applied to the transducer is relatively low, the number of contacts 
formed between the fingers through the facing layer is also low. In this operating 
range, the transducer exhibits an unrepeatable, nonlinear response. In this range the 
transducer is also relatively noisy. As pressure applied to the transducer increases, 
the number of connections between the fingers also increases. In this range the 
response is more repeatable although still nonlinear until fairly high pressures are 
applied. Because each of the connections between the interleaved fingers through the 
facing layer are electrically in parallel with one another, a single low resistance 
connection can dominate the response of the transducer unless the number of 
connections is very large. As noted above, when a relatively low pressure is applied 
to the transducer, the number of connections is not large. In the presence of one or 
more low resistance connections, transducer response tends to be noisy and very 
no
