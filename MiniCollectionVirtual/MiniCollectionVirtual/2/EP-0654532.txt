<ABSTRACT>
An IgM-class monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with the mucoglycoprotein produced by human 
gastric epithelioglandular mucous cells. It is possible to stain specifically human gastric epithelioglandular mucous 

cells and the mucus secreted by the cells by conducting immunological tissue staining with a labeled derivative of the 
above antibody. Further it is possible to use the antibody for analyzing mucoglycoproteins originating in the gastric 

epithelioglandular mucous cells contained in the human body fluid and for examining or diagnosing cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel monoclonal
antibody which can be used in assays for human gastric
gland-type mucus. Thus, the present invention provides a
novel antibody which has strong affinity for human gastric
gland mucous cells as well as for the mucus secreted thereby
but which has cross-reactivity neither with human gastric
surface mucous cells nor with the mucus secreted thereby.The mucus-secreting cells present in the epithelium of
alimentary tract mucosae including gastric mucosa are
considered to be involved in the maintenance of
gastrointestinal functions by synthesis, followed by
secretion, of mucus. Gastric mucus in particular is viewed
as one of the important defense factors to protect the
gastric mucosa from attack by such factors as gastric acid
and pepsin.The mucus production in the human stomach is effected
by surface mucous cells (covering epithelial cells) present
in the gastric mucosa surface epithelium and gastric gland
mucous cells present in the deep part of the gastric gland.
Recent years have seen attempts to differentiate individual 
mucus species produced by these mucous cells. A
histochemical staining method has been developed which is
specific for the sugar components peculiar to the respective
mucus species of surface mucous cells and gland mucous
cells, and hence is able to differentiate between them.
Thus, the mucus found in the surface mucous cells can be
specifically stained by the galactose oxidase-cold thionin
Schiff (GOCTS) reaction, while in the gland mucous cells
mucus as classified as class III by the Concanavalin A
paradoxical staining method (Katsuyama, T. and Spicer, S.S.
(1978), J. Histochem. Cytochem. 26, 233-250) is found to be
specifically localized (Ota, H. et al. (1991), Histochemical
J. 23, 22-28). Mucus gel layer covering the surface
epithelium of the gastric mucosa has been proved to be a
laminar structure of alternating layers of the GOCTS-reactive
mucus and the Class III mucus, and the mucus gel
layer has been found to contain both mucus species from
surface mucous cells and gland mucous cells (Ota, H. et al.
(1991), Histochemical J. 23, 22-28).Katsuyama et al. have elucidated that in normal tissues
class III mucus can be found only in the limited glandular
epithelia of the alimentary tract ranging from the cardiac
glands of the esophagus through the cardiac glands, mucous
neck cells and pyloric glands of the stomach, Brunner's
glands of the duodenum, the mucous glands of the papilla of
Vater and the mucous glands of the pancreatic duct in
