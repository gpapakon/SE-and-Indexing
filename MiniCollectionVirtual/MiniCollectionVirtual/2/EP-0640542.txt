<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a spring system for a holding-down mechanism of mechanical transfer ramps, which consists essentially of a tube, especially a square tube (1) with a cover plate (2) which is fastened to it and which has a bore (3) and on both sides is not completely closed off on the ramp face in the tube (1), so that there are two orifices (15) here. As a result, there extend parallel to the tube (1) two flat iron bars (4) which possess, level with the abutment (62), bores (14) for fastening to the lower frame (55) and opposite these, at the other end of the system, bores (6) for fastening a shaft (7) extending perpendicularly to them. The pneumatic spring with rod (12) and piston (9) extends between the shaft (7) and cover plate (2), the rod (12) corresponding to the distance x by which the pneumatic spring is compressed and extended. The dimension of the spring system is thus determined essentially by this distance x.

Spring system for a holding-down mechanism for drive-over 
bridges for loading ramps having a bridge 

platform (52) which can be swivelled, at its end 
nearest the ramp, about a horizontal spindle (51) and 

has: an extension (54) that can be folded inwards and 
outwards and is mounted for rotation about a spindle 

(53); a rear frame (56); a lower frame (55) and also a 
drive mechanism for raising the bridge platform (52), 

which mechanism produces an upward force (P); and a 
holding-down mechanism (60) which acts between an 

abutment (62) on the lower frame (55) and an abutment 
(61) on the bridge platform (52) and is connected, via 

a spring system (43) to the abutment (62) on the lower 
frame, wherein the said spring system (43) 


1.1 has a square tube (1) having a cover plate (2) 
which is fixedly connected thereto and has a bore 

(3), the cover plate (2) effecting closing-off 
incompletely on both sides, parallel to the tube 

(1) and thus having two openings (15) extending 
on the longitudinal sides, 
1.2 has two flat iron bars (4) which extend through 
each of the openings (15) and have, at the level 

of the abutment (62), a bore (14), in each case, 
for attachment to the lower frame (55), and which 

are fixedly connected, by the tube (1) at that 
end of the spring system (43) which is located 

oppositely from the abutment (62) on the lower 
frame, to a spindle (7) extending perpendicularly 

to the flat iron bars (4), and 
1.3 has a gas spring (9) having an actuating rod (12) 
and extending between the bore (3) in the cover 

plate (2) and the spindle (7), the range of  
 

movement of the actuating rod (12) corresponding 
to the span (x) by which the gas spring (9), (12) 

is compressed or extended. 
Spring system according to claim 1, wherein the 
spindle (7) is fastened to the flat iron bars (4) by 

nuts (8) in each case. 
Spring system according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
wherein a pressure spring is used as the gas spring 

(9), (12). 
Spring system according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the rod (12) of the gas spring (9), (12) has a 

thread (11) by means of which the spring is attached 
to the cover plate (2) through the bore (3) with a nut 

(13) which is welded on at that point.
