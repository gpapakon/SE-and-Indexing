<ABSTRACT>
A fractionation method for DNA fragments 
according to the present invention comprises a first 

step of preparing a probe chip or a set of probe chips 
immobilizing independently a DNA probe having a first 

sequence part having a specific known sequence part 
together with a part of enzyme recognition sequence and 

a second sequence part composed of a combination of one 
to six bases adjacent to the first sequence part at 3' 

terminus, a second step of introducing a DNA oligomer 
composed of a part of enzyme recognition sequence and a 

sequence complementary to the known sequence part into 
the fragment termini of DNA fragments from restriction 

enzyme cleavage, and a third step of placing the probe 
chip or the set of probe chips in a solution containing 

the nucleotide fragments with the introduced DNA 
oligomer produced at the second step, for at least 

hybridization and the complementary strand extension of 

the DNA probe, whereby the DNA fragments are 
fractionated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
fractionation method for nucleotide fragments (DNA or
RNA) and a DNA sequencing method of the same.When DNAs of different lengths are in the state
of a mixture, for example, in the state of enzyme
cleaved products of a long DNA, it is impossible to
immediately determine their DNA sequences.
Conventionally, two methods are known as the method for
analyzing such DNA sequences. A first method comprises
separating individual DNA fragments by gel
electrophoresis and subjecting the separated individual
fragments to DNA sequencing. A second method comprises
inserting these DNAs into an appropriate vector
(cloning), injecting the vector into E. coli which is
then cultured on agar medium, reculturing E. coli in
each generated colony and extracting DNA from the
bacterium in multiplication for DNA sequencing.For gel electrophoresis to be used for DNA 
separation, agarose gel or polyacrylamide gel may be
used. By gel electrophoresis, the difference of a
single base in DNA of a length of 400 b or less may be
discriminated, and furthermore, DNA of a length of 300 b
or less may be separated and fractionated. However, as
the length gets longer, the separation potency of the
gel may be lowered. Therefore, the first conventional
method is problematic because individual DNA fragments
cannot always be separated with identical fractionation
results.Alternatively, the second conventional method
via cloning is also problematic because the method
demands laborious works; because a DNA fragment of a far
shorter length cannot be cloned; and because a vast
number of clones may be required for DNA sequencing if
all clones corresponding to all fragments should be
separated, so as to secure the analysis of all
fragments.A DNA fractionation method utilizing
hybridization is known, comprising immobilizing DNA
probes of various DNA sequences onto a solid surface and
hybridizing objective DNA fragments with the probes,
whereby the fragments are separated and fractionated.
However, it is necessary in this case that the sequences
of the objective DNA fragments should be known to 
prepare the probes on a solid surface, so the method is
not applicable to DNA fragments with unknown sequences.The present invention overcomes these problems,
and is to provide a method for readily separating DNA
fragments, an analytical method of DNA sequence and the
like.The present invention relates to a
fractionation method for DNA fragments, comprising
treating a mixture of DNA fragments having a terminus
bonded with an
