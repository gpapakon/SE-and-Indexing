<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
recombinantly produced human colony stimulating factor-1
(CSF-1) in the treatment of viral infectious disease in
mammals, the virus being cytomegalovirus.The ability of certain factors produced in very low
concentration in a variety of tissues to stimulate the
growth and development of bone marrow progenitor cells into
granulocytes and/or macrophages has been known for nearly
15 years. The presence of such factors in sera, urine
samples, and tissue extracts from a number of species is
demonstrable using an in vitro assay which measures the
stimulation of colony formation by bone marrow cells plated
in semi-solid culture medium. There is no known in vivo
assay. Because these factors induce the formation of such
colonies, the factors collectively have been called Colony
Stimulating Factors (CSF).More recently, it has been shown that there are at
least four subclasses of human CSF proteins which can be
defined according to the types of cells found in the
resultant colonies. One subclass, CSF-1 results in 
colonies containing macrophages predominantly. Other
subclasses produce colonies which contain both neutrophilic
granulocytes and macrophages; which contain
predominantly neutrophilic granulocytes; and which
contain neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes and
macrophages.There are murine factors analogous to the
above human CSFs, including a murine factor called IL-3
which induces colonies from murine bone marrow cells
which contain all these cell types plus megakaryocytes,
erythrocytes, and mast cells, in various combinations.
These CSFs have been reviewed by Dexter, T. M., Nature
(1984) 309:746, and Vadas, M. A., et al, J Immunol
(1983) 130:793, Clark, S.C., Science (1987) 236:1229,
and Sachs, L., Science (1987) 238:1374.The invention herein is concerned with the
use of recombinant proteins which are members of
the first of these subclasses, CSF-1. This subclass has
been further characterized and delineated by specific
radioimmunoassays and radioreceptor assays --e.g.,
antibodies raised against purified CSF-1 are able to
suppress specifically CSF-1 activity, without affecting
the biological activities of the other subclasses, and
macrophage cell line J774 contains receptors which bind
CSF-1 specifically. A description of these assays was
published by Das, S. K., et al, Blood (1981) 58:630.A significant difficulty in putting CSF
proteins in general, and CSF-1 in particular, to any
useful function has been their unavailability in
distinct and characterizable
