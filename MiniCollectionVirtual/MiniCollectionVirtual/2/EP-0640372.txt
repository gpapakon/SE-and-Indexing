<ABSTRACT>
A portable air cleaner comprising a cylindrical filter 
element mounted on a circular base and encased by a cylindrical 

cover. A centrifugal fan mounted within the cover draws 
unpurified air into inlet openings disposed in the base and the 

side wall of the cover, and through the filter element. The 
resulting purified air is drawn into the centrifugal fan and 

forced radially outward therefrom. An air deflector dish 
redirects the purified air through the exhaust openings disposed 

on the top surface of the cylindrical cover. Such an exhaust 
flow which is perpendicular to and spaced from the inlet flow 

results in an improved efficiency in purifying the entire volume 
of air within a room.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable air cleaner comprising a cylindrical filter
element mounted on a base, a cover encasing said filter element having a top portion
defining an air exhaust opening and a side wall defining an air inlet opening therein
extending transversely of said air exhaust opening, a fan disposed within the cover for
drawing air into the air inlet opening through said filter element for exhaustion
through the air exhaust opening, and electrical components including drive means
and associated electrical circuitry for driving the fan.Such an air cleaner is known from US-A-4627862.Portable air cleaners for use in removing smoke, dust, pollen, bacteria and other
particulate matter from the air through the use of filter elements such as high
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are well known. A HEPA filter, by
definition, has a 99.97% minimum efficiency of removing airborne particulates of a
size of 0.3 microns or larger.US-A-4,629,4827 discloses a
portable air purification apparatus which employs a cylindrical HEPA filter, which is
mounted between a base and a cover, and a centrifugal fan disposed in the base to
produce a purified air flow. In operation, the centrifugal fan draws unpurified air
through the exposed wall of the cylindrical HEPA filter. The resulting purified air is
then radially directed by the centrifugal fan through radially disposed exhaust
openings in the base. US-A-4629482 further discloses that it is critical
that the radially disposed exhaust openings be horizontally aligned with the
centrifugal fan blades so as to produce a non-turbulent exhaust flow which is said to
pulsate when the inlet flow is reduced below a certain level due to a clogged HEPA
filter. This pulsation of the exhaust air flow is intended to alert the user to replace
the HEPA filter. The configuration of HEPA filter air cleaners wherein the inlet openings and the
exhaust openings are both radially disposed has several significant drawbacks. First,
given the proximity of the exhaust openings to the inlet openings, a portion of the
exhausted purified air will be immediately recirculated back into the air cleaner. This
flow pattern results in a reduced efficiency of room air purification, i.e. reduced
number of complete room air changes. Second, exhaust flow through exhaust
openings that are radially disposed in the lower base portion of the air cleaner may
cause particulates on the flooring on which the portable air cleaner is placed, for
example, carpeting, to be dispersed into the
