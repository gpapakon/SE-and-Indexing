<ABSTRACT>
A remote service facility (RSF) unit is integrated 
into the operating system of the host system being 

supported. The RSF unit utilizes a standard generic 
menu interface system (GMIS) unit through which a user 

can enter different types of commands which results in 
the display of a number of menu sequences for 

configuring how the different independently controllable 
components of the RSF unit will operate in performing 

remote support functions. The components include a 
probl
em detection and reaction component, a system 
action component and a callback component, each of which 

operatively couple to the GMIS unit. The components are 
integrated in a predetermined manner so that 

collectively, they carry out remote support according to 
the way in which they were configured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for
detecting and reporting problems encountered in a host
system during normal operations and more particularly to
methods and systems for providing remote maintenance and
support services for such host systems.Numerous kinds of systems have been developed over
the years for maintaining and diagnosing faults
occurring within data processing systems either locally
ore remotely. Such systems have taken the form of
system management apparatus, maintenance processors and
remote maintenance system interfaces and systems.
Examples of these types of systems are discussed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,298,935, 5,202,963, and 5,210,757.Also, software components have been used to provide
remote support for host systems. One such system
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,111,384 provides for
automating the dump analysis process. Another type of
system monitors a system error log to detect problems
and automatically calls a remote center for diagnosis
and corrective action. An example of this system is the
remote maintenance manager (RMM) tool developed by Bull
HN Information Systems Inc. which is described in the
publication entitled, "DPX/2 500 Remote Maintenance
Facility Guide," published by Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., dated March, 1991 and having Order No.
LW07-00.The remote maintenance manager (RMM) subsystem tool
is implemented as a single component which is integrated
into the operating system of the host system. The tool
includes a daemon (background) process that is
initialized by an interface program run by an 
administrator or operator to set up parameters for the
RMM subsystem. The daemon process continues to monitor
the host system for error conditions established through
exceeding predetermined thresholds and responds by
making an automatic callout to a response center when an
established threshold has been exceeded.Upon receipt of the callout and accompanying
message, a remote operator is able to determine the
source of the callout by examining the message contents.
When the callout is made, the administrator is informed
of the action by receipt of a mail message. Also, the
remote operator writes a message to the administrator's
console notifying the administrator when a callback has
been made to host system by the remote operator. Such
callback takes the form of the remote operator logging
onto the host system's operating system facilities
wherein the remote operator initiates a remote session.If the administrator needs to terminate the remote
session, the
