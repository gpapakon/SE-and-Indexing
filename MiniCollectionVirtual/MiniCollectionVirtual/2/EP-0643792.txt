<ABSTRACT>
An improved earth-boring bit of the rolling cone variety (65) and an insert (65, 83, 85) for use therein is provided. A superabrasive element is coated with at least one layer of metallic material (219, 221, 223). The superabrasive element then is placed in a receptacle cavity (215) in a pre-formed hard metal jacket (213). The superabrasive element then is brazed or infiltrated to the hard metal jacket. Metallurgical and mechanical bonds between the superabrasive element, the at least one layer of metallic material on superabrasive element, the braze or infiltrant binder material, and the fracture-tough material of the hard metal jacket retain the superabrasive element in the cavity of the hard metal jacket. Improved earth-boring bits according to this embodiment of the present invention provide abrasion-resistant earth-boring bits of the rolling cutter variety. Such improved bits, and the inserts therefor, are formed without resort to high-temperature, high-pressure processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
earth-boring bits of the rolling cutter type and to
improvements in gage and heel row compacts for such bits
by which the resistance to wear is increased, the
improved compacts being formed with a hard metal jacket
and a superabrasive working surface.Wear-resistant inserts or compacts are utilized in
a variety of earth-boring tools where the inserts form
rock cutting, crushing, chipping or abrading elements.
In rotary well drilling, some geological formations are
drilled with bits having cutting structures of
wear-resistant (usually sintered tungsten carbide)
compacts held in receiving apertures in rotatable cones.
In such bits, there is usually on each cone a group of
cylindrical compacts that define a circumferential heel
row that removes earth at the corner of the bore hole
bottom. Further, it is common to insert additional
cylindrical compacts, called "gage" compacts, on a "gage"
surface that intersects a generally conical surface that
receives the heel row compacts. These gage compacts
protect the gage surfaces to prevent erosion of the metal
of the cones that supports the heel row compacts. As a
result, fewer heel compacts are lost during drilling and
the original diameter of the bit is better maintained due
to decreased wear. Moreover, the gage compacts also ream
the hole to full "gage" after the heel compacts are worn
to an undersized condition. Fixed cutter bits, either steel-bodied or matrix,
are also utilized in drilling certain types of geological
formations effectively. While these bits do not feature
rotatable cones, they also have wear-resistant inserts
advantageously positioned in the "shoulder" or "gage"
regions on the face of the bit which are essential to
prolong the useful life of the bit.A typical prior-art wear-resistant insert was
manufactured of sintered tungsten carbide, a composition
of mono and/or ditungsten carbide cemented with a binder
typically selected from the iron group, consisting of
cobalt, nickel or iron. Cobalt generally ranged from
about 6 to 16% of the binder, the balance being tungsten
carbide. The exact composition depended upon the usage
intended for the tool and its inserts.In recent years, both natural and synthetic diamonds
and other superabrasive materials have been used, in
addition to tungsten carbide compacts, as cutting inserts
on rotary and fixed cutter rock bits. In fact, it has
long been recognized that tungsten carbide as a matrix
for superabrasives has the advantage that the carbide
itself is
