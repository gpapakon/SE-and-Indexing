<ABSTRACT>
An antitheft device (1) for a vehicle such as a motorcycle or an 
automobile for 

preventing theft of the vehicle by controlling the ignition system (4) 
of the vehicle. The 

antitheft device includes a power supply (2), an ignition device (4) 
for starting the vehicle's 

engine, an ignition switch (3) having a switch mechanism (6) for opening 
and closing a 

power circuit between the power supply (2) and ignition device (4) and 
an antitheft unit (5). The 

ignition switch (3) includes a mechanical locking means for selectively 
preventing the 

normal steering operation of the vehicle as well as sensors (7,8) for 
detecting the removal 

or destruction of the switch mechanism (6) or the mechanical locking 
means. The 

antitheft unit (5) includes means for receiving an input signal and, 
responsive both to a signal 

output by said sensors (7,8) and to the input signal, controls the 
operation of the ignition 

device (4). The ignition device (4) can thus be disabled by controlling 
the switch mechanism (6) 

to open the power circuit between the power supply (26) and ignition 
device (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antitheft device
and a method of preventing undesired use of a vehicle having
an engine ignition system, an ignition switch and an
antitheft unit.A respective antitheft device is known from e.g.
U.S. 4,449,605 or JP 55-44071 on which the preamble of
claim 1 is based. The antitheft device disclosed in these
documents includes an engine ignition device and a power
supply for the engine ignition device. Furthermore, this
conventional device comprises an ignition switch including
switching means for opening and closing a circuit connection
between the engine ignition device and the power supply,
while the ignition switch further includes locking
means for mechanically inhibiting normal use of the vehicle
and sensor means for detecting the removal or destruction
of the switching means and/or the locking means. In response
to the detection of the removal or destruction of
the switching means and/or the locking means by the sensor
means the antitheft unit causes a disablement condition
wherein at least part of the engine ignition device is
disabled.Furthermore, document EP-A-0 582 482 which falls within
the terms of Art. 54(3) EPC, discloses an antitheft device
for a vehicle having an engine ignition device and a power
supply for the engine ignition device wherein the antitheft
device comprises an ignition switch including switching
means for opening and closing a circuit connection between
the engine ignition device and the power supply. Similar to
the above-mentioned conventional devices this document also
discloses an ignition switch including locking means for
mechanically inhibiting normal use of the vehicle and sensor 
means for detecting the removal or destruction of at
least one of the switching means or the locking means. In
addition, the antitheft unit includes means for causing a
first disablement condition in response to an input signal
wherein at least a part of the ignition device is disabled,
and means for causing a second disablement condition in response
to the detection of a removal or destruction of the
switching means and/or the locking means by the sensor
means wherein the at least one part of the engine ignition
device is disabled and the second disablement condition
differs from the first disablement condition.Document US-A-4,749,873 discloses a further antitheft
device in which at least tampering of the electric system
including an ignition switch causes a disablement of an
engine control unit and in which a further disablement condition
is caused in
