<ABSTRACT>
A shuttle-type embroidering machine possesses a yarn-cutting device (17) with knives (21) which are each guided by a guide element (25). A plurality of knives (21) and the associated guide elements are in each case formed on a knife rail (31) or combined to form a guide plate (25). The knife rails (31) and guide plates (25) are arranged on rails (33, 35) which are connected to one another in an articulated manner by means of the levers (39, 41) and which are displaceable relative to one another. For pivoting the levers (39, 41), a shaft (43) connected fixedly in terms of rotation to a lever (37) is provided. The lever (37) is articulated on the angle lever (39). As a result of the rotation of the shaft (43), the rails (33, 35), guided perpendicularly to their longitudinal extension, are displaced upwards and apart from one another. Furthermore, a slotted link (45) having a cam (49) cooperating with a fixed part (not shown) is provided on the shaft (43). As a result, during the rotation of the shaft (43), an advancing movement of the latter is simultaneously brought about. The yarn-cutting device makes it possible to cut the rear yarn without any additional clamping device.

Shuttle embroidering machine comprising shuttle guideways 
located on a profile (15), said shuttle guideways bordering 

a stitch plate on the side facing the fabric, and thread 
cutter (17) for the back thread, said thread cutter comprising 

a knife (21) which for a cutting operation can be 
positioned by a mechanism (19) in front of the stitch 

plate, characterised in that the knife (21) comprises a 
guide element (25), and in that for cutting of the thread 

the mechanism (19) provides a relative motion between knife 
(21) and guide element (25). 
Embroidering machine as in claim 1, characterised in that 
an edge (29) of the guide element (25) is formed as a 

cutting edge which cooperates whith the cutting edge (23) 
of the knife (21). 
Embroidering machine as in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the knife (21) and the guide elements (25) are 

removably fastened to rails (35, 33). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a plurality of knives (21) and guide 

elements are in form of a block on a knife bar (31) and 
combined to a guide plate (25), respectively. 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the knives (21) are in such an 

operative relationship with the mechanism (19) that, on 
actuation of the mechanism, a movement of the knives (21) 

at least one along one axis (60) and a relative motion of 
said axis takes place.  

 
Embroidering machine as in claim 5, characterised in that 
the mechanism comprises a tiltable lever (55) pivotally 

connecting the rails (33, 35). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the rails (33, 35) are connected by 

two levers (41, 39) connected in series, one lever (41) 
being pivotally connected to one rail (35), and a bell 

crank (39) being pivotally connected at its bend to the 
other rail (33). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that the actuating mechanism (19) 

comprises a drive shaft (43) rigidly connected to a lever 
(57) which with its other end is pivotally connected to the 

lever (39, 55). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that for generating a feed motion the 

drive shaft (43) is rigidly connected to a cam (45) 
comprising a curve (49), and in that the cam (45) 

cooperates with a stationary part. 
Embroidering machine as in claim 9, characterised in that 
the cam (45) is cylindrical and comprises in its mantle a 

curved channel (49) into which a stationary stud (51) 
protrudes. 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the knive (21) has a hook-like 

cutting edge (23). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the knife (21) has a straight cutting 

edge (24) which is arranged at an angle to the upper edge 
(29).  

 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 4 to 12, 
characterised in that guide members (27) are provided at 

the guide plate (25), said guide members (27) slidably 
connecting the knive bar (31) with the guide plate (25). 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 4 to 13, 
characterised in that the knive bar (31) and the guide 

plate (25) are biased together. 
Embroidering machine as in one of the claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the thread cutter (17) is mounted on 

the profile (15).
