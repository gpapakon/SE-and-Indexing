<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive arrangement for motor vehicles, especially with hybrid drive, comprising, in series, an internal combustion engine (2), a first separating clutch (3), an electric machine (4), a second separating clutch (5) and a gearbox (6), the casing (7) of which is connected to the internal combustion engine by way of an intermediate flange (8). To obtain an assembly unit which is easy to install and replace, the invention proposes that the intermediate flange should have in its interior axially offset annular flanges (10, 11) connected by way of a concentric sleeve (9), the sleeve carrying in a rotatable manner on its outer circumference a rotor (13) belonging to the electric machine and connected for rotation in common to the second separating clutch, and this rotary unit being connected in terms of drive to the first separating clutch by way of an intermediate shaft (23) in alignment with the input shaft (20) of the gearbox, a release device (14) belonging to the first separating clutch being arranged on the inner annular flange, coaxially with the intermediate shaft.

A drive arrangement for a motor vehicle, especially with hybrid drive, 

comprising in sequential order an internal combustion engine (2), a 
first disconnectable clutch (3), an electric motor (4), a second 

disconnectable clutch (5) and a manual gearbox (6), with 
the gearbox housing (7) connected to the internal combustion engine 
(2) via an adapter flange (8), wherein 
the stator of the electric motor (4) is arranged on the adapter flange 
(8), 
 
characterised in that 


the adapter flange (8) is internally provided via a sleeve (9) with two 
annular flanges (10, 11) displaced relative to each other, wherein 
the sleeve (9) borne by the first annular flange (10) arranged on the 
housing wall (12) of the adapter flange (8) facilitates at its outer 

circumference the rotational arrangement of the rotor (13) of the 
electric motor (4), and 
the second annular flange (11) arranged on the sleeve (9) and 
orientated radially inwards is provided as a support for a disengaging 

device (14) for one of the disconnectable clutches (3, 5). 
A drive arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that 

the adapter flange (8) with the first annular flange (10) of the first 
disconnectable clutch (3) on the internal combustion engine side is 

arranged adjacently between the internal combustion engine (2) and 
the manual gearbox (6), wherein 
a hydraulically-actuatable disengaging device (14) is provided on the 
second annular flange (11) facing the sleeve (9) of the disconnectable 

clutch (3) on the internal combustion engine side. 
A drive arrangement according to claim 1 and claim 2, characterised in that  
 


the hydraulically-actuatable disengaging device (14) is connected to 
a control line (15) arranged integrated in the annular flanges (10, 11) 

and in the sleeve (9), with the said control line (15) 
provided with a connection (16) in the housing wall (12) of the 
adapter flange (8). 
A drive arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that 


a collar (17) anti-frictionally arranged on the sleeve (9) is in drive 
connection with the internal combustion engine (2) via the first 

disconnectable clutch (3), whereby 
the collar (17) on the one hand bears the rotor (13) of the electric 
motor (4) and on the other hand the second disconnectable clutch (5) 

on the manual gearbox side, the 
clutch disc of which, bearing clutch linings (18), is in torsionally. 
resistant connection with the input shaft (20) of the manual gearbox 

(6). 
A drive arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that 


the drive connection of the collar (17) comprises an elastic drive disc 
(21), which 
is in torsionally-resistant connection in its outer circumferential region 
via the collar (17) with an axially-immovable thrust ring (22) of the 

disconnectable clutch (5) on the manual gearbox side joined to the 
collar (17) with torsional resistance, and in its central region with an 

intermediate shaft (23) centred relative to the input shaft (20) of the 
manual gearbox (6), 
whereby the intermediate shaft (23) arranged centred on the internal 
combustion engine side in a crankshaft (24) is in torsionally-resistant 

connection with a clutch disc (19'), bearing a clutch lining (18'), of  
 

the first disconnectable clutch (3). 
A drive arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that 


a flywheel (25) connected to the crankshaft (24) with torsional 
resistance serves as an axially-immovable thrust ring (26) for the first 

disconnectable clutch (3) on the internal combustion engine side, and 
the two disconnectable clutches (3, 5) are identical parts except for 
the axially-immovable thrust rings (22, 26), whereby 
the disconnectable clutch (5) on the manual gearbox side works in 
conjunction with a hydraulically-actuatable disengaging device (27) 

arranged concentrically to the gearbox input shaft (20) on the 
gearbox housing (7). 
A drive arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the two hydraulically-actuatable disengaging devices (14, 27) are
