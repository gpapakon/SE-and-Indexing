<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sample sorting 
apparatus for taking up a parent sample from a parent 
sample vessel containing a sampled liquid (to be 
referred to as a "parent sample" hereinafter), e.g., 
blood, and distributing a predetermined amount of the 
took up parent sample as a sample (to be referred to as 
a "child sample" hereinafter) to be subjected to various 
types of inspection and analysis to a child sample 
vessel. Generally, when a parent sample is to be took up 
from a test tube serving as a parent sample vessel and 
be distributed to other plurality of test tubes serving 
as child sample vessels, a batch type sample sorting 
apparatus (taking up/distributing apparatus) is used. 
With this sample sorting apparatus, the parent sample 
took up from the test tube serving as the parent sample 
vessel is distributed to a preset number of (e.g., five) 
empty test tubes in a predetermined amount, and the test 
tubes containing the distributed parent sample are 
transported by a transporting means to a position 
where various types of inspection and analysis are 
performed. However, this batch type sample sorting apparatus 
can only distribute all the parent samples to correspond 
to a predetermined number of (e.g., five) inspection 
items. Hence, when the respective parent samples are to  
 
be distributed to correspond to different numbers of 
inspection items, sometimes the number of test tubes 
for storing the child sample is excessive or short. 
Therefore, the processing efficiency is degraded. The present invention has been made to cope with 
the above situation, and has as its object to provide a 
sample sorting apparatus that can efficiently and accurately 
perform distribution even when the respective 
parent samples are to be distributed to correspond to 
different numbers of inspection items. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a more efficient sample sorting system by coupling 
sample sorting apparatuses. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a sample sorting apparatus comprising first 
conveying means for conveying a parent sample vessel 
containing a parent sample along a first convey path; 
means for taking up the parent sample from the parent 
sample vessel conveyed by the first conveying means; 
sample recognition information reading means for reading 
sample recognition information attached to the parent 
sample vessel; second conveying means for conveying 
child sample vessels along a second convey path; and 
means for distributing
