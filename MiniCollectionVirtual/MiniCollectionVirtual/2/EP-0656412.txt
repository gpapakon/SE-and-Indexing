<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid crystal composition 
for liquid crystal display elements and a liquid crystal 
display element using the same. More particularly, it 
relates to a nematic liquid crystal composition for 
a liquid crystal display of active matrix mode needing 
a high reliability, and a liquid crystal display element 
using the same. As a theme for developing LCD (liquid crystal display 
device), two points of high precision (high contrast) and 
high speed response have been mentioned and researched 
including its display method. Among them, active matrix 
LCD (AM-LCD) including TFT (thin film transistor) has been 
advanced in the coloration and high precision and expected 
as a prospective winner of flat pannel display. However, 
its precision, response speed, picture surface size, etc. 
are far inferior to those of CRT which has been now most 
popularized among displays. Thus, vigorous research has 
been made on various elements constituting AM-LCD such as 
driving circuit, switching element, color filter, etc. 
Further, for liquid crystal materials, there have been 
required characteristics which can not be satisfied by 
conventional material systems having cyano group such as 
biphenyl systems, PCH systems, etc.  The present inventors have been considering that 
cyano group of terminal group or side chain has a certain 
mutual action upon ionic impurities present in display 
element to thereby have a bad influence upon current 
value, specific resistance value and hence display 
contrast, as disclosed in Japanese patent application 
laid-open No. Hei 2-289682. The drawback of the compound 
having cyano group consists in that,as a reduction of 
reliability in element, increase in the consumed current 
and reduction in the specific resistance are led, coupled 
with the driving current of two-terminal or three-terminal 
switch element, and display uneveness and reduction in 
the contrast are caused in the aspect of display 
characteristic. For example, the contrast in TFT liquid crystal display 
element, shown in Fig. 1 is closely related to its 
signal voltage-retaining characteristic. This signal 
voltage-retaining characteristic of the liquid crystal 
display element refer to a degree of reduction in the 
signal voltage impressed onto TFT pixel containing liquid 
crystal within a definite frame period. In the case where 
the reduction in the signal voltage is absent, the contrast 
reduction does not occur. Further, as to the signal 
voltage-retaining characteristic, the lower the
