<ABSTRACT>
Device for fastening panel-like elements (7) on carrying elements (1), fastened on a building wall (6), by means of fastening elements (2) which are each formed by an outer part (2b) and an inner part (2a), of which the outer or inner part (2b, 2a) is provided with a bearing surface (2c) for the border of a panel-like element (7) and the outer part (2b) is provided in each case with an abutment surface (2d) for said panel-like element and an adjacent panel-like element (7), and which are arranged together on a screw-bolt (4) which is retained by the respective carrying element (1) and, with pressing of the outer part (2b) and inner part (2a), produces a positively locking connection between the fastening element (2) and the carrying element (1). In order to fasten multi-layered elements (7), each fastening element (2) is provided with an additional bearing surface (8a) for the border (9a), which belongs to the outermost layer (9) and is offset towards the nut with respect to the border (11a) of the load-bearing rearmost layer (11), and with additional abutment surfaces (8b) for said outermost layer (9) and the outermost layer (9) of the adjacent element (7), the distance of the additional abutment surfaces (8b) from the inner part (2a), in the ready-mounted state, being greater than the overall thickness of the at least two-layered element (7).

Device for fastening panel-like elements (7), in 
particular for facade or roof cladding, on load-bearing 

elements (1), fastened on a building wall (6) or on a 
roof, by means of fastening elements (2) which are each 

formed by an outer part (2b) and an inner part (2a), of 
which the outer or inner part (2b, 2a) is provided with 

a supporting surface (2c) for the border of a panel-like 
element (7) and the outer part (2b) is provided in each 

case with a bearing surface (2d) for said panel-like 
element (7) and an adjacent panel-like element (7), and 

both the outer part (2b) and the inner part (2a) being 
arranged jointly on a screw-bolt (4) which is retained by 

the respective load-bearing element (1) and, with the 
outer part (2b) and inner part (2a) being pressed against 

one another, produces a positively locking connection 
between the fastening element (2) and load-bearing 

element (1), characterized in that, in order to fasten at 
least two-pane elements (7), each fastening element (2) 

is provided with an additional supporting surface (8a) 
for the border (9a) which belongs to the outermost pane 

(9) and is offset towards-the pane centre with respect to 
the border (11a) of the load-bearing rearmost pane (11), 

and with additional bearing surfaces (8b) for said 
outermost pane (9) and for the outermost pane (9) of the 

adjacent element (7), the distance of the additional 
bearing surfaces (8b) from the inner part (2a), in the 

mounted state, being greater than the overall thickness 
of the at least two-pane element (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the additional supporting and bearing surfaces (8a,  

 
8b) are formed on the outer part (2b) of the fastening 

element (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the additional supporting and bearing surfaces (8a, 

8b) are formed on an additional part (8), which is 
arranged in a positively locking manner on the outer part 

(2b) of the fastening element (2) and is retained by the 
screw-bolt (4). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the additional part (8) is arranged between the 

outer and inner parts (2b, 2a) of the fastening element 
(2). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the additional part (8) is arranged on the outer 

side of the outer part (2b) of the fastening element (2). 
Device according to Claims 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the additional part (8) is designed with angled-off 

portions (10) in order that it can bear in a 
positively locking manner against the outer part (2b) of 

the fastening element (2). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that elastic intermediate layers (15) 

are arranged between the supporting and/or bearing 
surfaces (2c, 8a, 2d, 8b) for the rearmost and outermost 

panes (11, 9) of the at least two-pane element (7). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the two-pane elements (7) are 

designed as laminated-glass units, two-pane safety-glass 
units, insulating-glass units designed with an evacuated 

interspace, or as photovoltaic elements which exhibit a 
plastic intermediate layer (14) between a load-bearing 

rear pane (11), preferably made of toughened safety 
glass, and an outer covering pane (9), preferably made of 

flint glass, into which intermediate layer there are 
embedded interconnected silicon cells for the direct 

conversion of light energy into electric energy.
