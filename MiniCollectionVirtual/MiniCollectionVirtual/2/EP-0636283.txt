Plug for the electrically leakproof 
closure of a tip jack (30; 130) of a medium- or 

high-tension energy supply system for a cable 
connector, with a resiliently deformable plug body 

(1; 101) of an electrically insulating material 
which comprises, between an end portion (4; 104) 

which is tapered conically towards one of its ends 
and the other end portion which is connected to a 

metal cover (2; 102), a central portion (5; 105) 
the outside diameter of which is smaller than the 

largest outside diameter of the conical end 
portion (4; 104), the plug body having a central 

cavity (8; 108) designed as a blind hole, which 
extends from the end pointing towards the cover 

(2; 102) into the conical end portion (4; 104), 
characterized in that, on the narrow end of the 

conical end portion (4; 104), there is a shaped 
body (10; 121, 125) which has an electrically-conductive 

surface and of which the face facing 
away from the plug body (1; 101) can contact the 

contact bush (31) of the tip jack (30; 130) and 
the face pointing towards the plug body (1; 101) 

is formed as a field control electrode (11; 122). 
Plug according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the shaped body is a unitary, annular body  

 
(10) concentric with the plug body (1) and 

connected thereto by means of a projection (12) of 
the plug body (1) extending through its central 

opening and engaged behind the edge thereof. 
Plug according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the metallic, annular body (10) has the 

shape of a torus on the side forming the field 
control electrode (11), and in that this shape 

fits the adjacent face of the conical end portion 
(4) of the plug body (1). 
Plug according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the surface forming the field control 

electrode (122) comprises a spherical-cap-like 
central region surrounded by an edge region (123) 

with opposite curvature. 
Plug according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the shaped body consists of an element 

(121) forming the field control electrode (122) as 
well as a metal plate (125), and in that the 

former element (121) is composed of a 
semiconducting material or of an insulating 

material provided with a conductive layer on its 

surface.  
 
Plug according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the element (121) which forms the field 

control electrode (122) is composed of silicone 
rubber. 
Plug according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, 
characterized in that the edge region (123) is 

formed by a flange-like portion of material 
projecting beyond the cylindrical central portion. 
Plug according to any one of Claims 4 to 
7, characterized in that the metal plate (125) is 

provided with at least one hole and is connected 
to the element (121) forming the field control 

electrode (122) by means of a projection (126) of 
the element (121) forming the field control 

electrode (122) extending through the hole and 
engaged behind the edge thereof. 
Plug according to any one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that 


a) adjacent the end surface of the cavity 
(108) which is disposed in the conical 

end portion (104) is an electrically 
conductive thrust body (114) which forms 

a spherical-cap-like field control 
electrode (115) on the side facing the  

 
end face of the conical end portion 

(104); 
b) the thrust body (114) is disposed on one 
end of a rod-shaped force-transmission 

member (116) which carries a spring plate 
(117) in the region of its other end; 
c) a prestressed compression spring (120) 
bears against the spring plate (117) on 

one side and the cover (102) on the other 
side and connects the thrust body (114) 

electrically to the cover (102) which is 
at earth potential when the plug is 

inserted; 
d) a contact body (121, 125) connected to 
the smaller-diameter end of the conical 

end portion (104) can be placed against 
the contact bush of the tip jack forming 

a contact and forms a field control 
electrode (122) with the side facing the 

thrust body (114); and 
e) the insulation capacity of the material 
of the plug body (101) disposed between 

the two field control electrodes (115, 
122) is greater than is required by the  

 
maximum voltage arising between the two 

field control electrodes (115, 122). 
Plug according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the surface of the thrust body (114) 

forming the field control electrode (115) and the 
central region of the electrode (122) formed by 

the shaped body have the same centre of curvature.
