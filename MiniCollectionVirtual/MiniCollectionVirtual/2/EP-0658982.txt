<ABSTRACT>
An arithmetic datastream (Cj) representative of an
original sequence (S
N
··· S
2
S
1
) of input bi-level symbols (Si)
is transmitted, before an information code (Kp) carrying

information on a total length (N) of the input symbols, from
a coding subsystem (10) to a decoding subsystem (40). A

register (45) shifts out respective transmitted portions (Cj)
of the datastream to an arithmetic decoder (46). where they

are decoded into a relatively long symbol sequence ( ···S
N+1
S
N

··· S
2
S
1
) starting with the same sequence as the orioginal
sequence. The decoded symbol sequence is output through an

output circuit (47) which counts symbols (Si) in that sequence.
The register (45) holds a final portion (C
n
 ··· C
n-15
) of the
datastream. The information code (Kp) is decoded by an

information decoder (44), which informs the output circuit
(47) of decoded information (N). before flushing the register

(45) to input the final portion of the datastream to the
arithmetic decoder. The output symbol sequence (S
N
 ··· S
2
S
1
)
becomes equal in symbol number to the original sequence, when

the output circuit (47) stops output.

or column, that are input to the arithmetic coder 113. where

number N of the input symbols Si and codes a total count N
thereof into a count code in the form of a sequence of bits Kp
