<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shift control
device of a hydraulic control system for an automatic
transmission system. More particularly, it relates to a
shift control device of a hydraulic control system that
may perform a five-speed shift control and improve shift
sense and speedy response ability of operating elements,
and includes a means for preventing a reverse when a
shift lever is shifted to a reverse "R" range during a
forward running.A conventional automatic transmission for a vehicle
has a torque converter and a multiple stage transmission
gear mechanism connected with the torque converter,
which includes a hydraulically-actuated friction member
for selecting one among a plurality of gear stages of
the transmission gear mechanism in accordance with
vehicle operating conditions.A hydraulic pressure generated by an oil pump is
provided to the friction members for transmitting
dynamics of the multiple stage transmission gear
mechanism via the shift valves of the hydraulic control
system.The commonly-used automatic transmission for a
vehicle has the torque converter which generally
includes a pump impeller connected with an engine output
shaft to be driven thereby, a turbine runner connected
with an input shaft of the transmission system to
operate and a stator disposed between the pump impeller
and the turbine runner. According to this structure, the
hydraulic fluid is circulated by the engine-driven pump
impeller through the turbine runner with the aid of the
stator which functions to deflect the hydraulic fluid 
from the turbine runner to a direction where fluid flow does not disturb a rotation of
the pump impeller when the fluid flows into the pump impeller. an automatic shift is
made by an operation of the friction members such as clutches or a kick-down brake
at each shift change. The above friction members selectively operate due to the
change in the direction of fluid flow by a plurality of valves of the hydraulic control
device. Besides, a manual valve, a port of which is converted by selecting a position
of a selector lever, is designed to be supplied with a fluid pump and to supply the
fluid to a shift control valve. The shift control valve provides a hydraulic pressure to
a one or more than one shift valve among a plurality of shift valves according to ON-OFF
operation of a shift control solenoid valve controlled by a transmission control
unit, and controls these shift valves to form a line.Such a hydraulic control system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,776,240,
4,870,877 abd
