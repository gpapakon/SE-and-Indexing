<ABSTRACT>
In a process for correcting the speeds of rotation of the wheels of a vehicle which are determined by wheel sensors and which differ because of the different wheel diameters, the vehicle speed is measured during slip-free travel from the wheel speeds, and placed in relation with the wheel speeds. Correction values for the wheels are determined and used to continuously correct the wheel speeds.

1. Process for correcting the speeds of rotation of 
vehicle wheels determined by wheel sensors, in which the 

vehicle speed V
F
 is determined in periods of time without 
wheel slip, in which correction values K are determined 

from the deviations of the speeds of rotation of the 
wheels from this vehicle speed, and in which the speeds 

of rotation of the wheels are subsequently corrected 
using these correction values, characterised in that, to 

determine the vehicle speed, the wheel pair with the 
lowest speed difference is determined by pairwise comparison 

of the speeds of rotation of the wheels, and in 
that the wheel speeds of these wheels are averaged. 
2. Process according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the determination of the vehicle speed is carried 

out in periods of time in which no slip control (ABS or 
ASR or engine drag torque control) is being effected. 
3. Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the determination of the actual vehicle speed is 

carried out in periods of time in which there is no 
braking.

vehicle speed is carried out in periods of time in which 
the engine is outputting a low torque.

vehicle speed is carried out in periods of time in which 
the vehicle is travelling in a predetermined speed range. 
6. Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

another by less than a predetermined small value (e.g.
