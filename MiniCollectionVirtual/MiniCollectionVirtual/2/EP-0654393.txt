<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an electric power 
steering apparatus in which it is decided whether or not 

steering torque is in a predetermined drive inhibition area, 
and when the term in which the decision result is logically 

inconsistent with driving instruction for the motor (5) in 
accordance with the steering torque is shorter than a 

predetermined period of time, a timer (23) is reset to drive the 
motor (5). As a result, the compensation of the inertia of said 

motor (5) can be controlled even when the steering torque is 
small. Further, in the electric power steering apparatus, 

the timer (23) is also reset to drive the motor when the steering 
torque is in a dead zone and a driving current for the motor 

is smaller than a predetermined value. As a result, the 
drive of the motor can be controlled also when a steering 

wheel is returned to its initial position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus for assisting a steering power of a 
steering wheel by using an electric motor as known from 
EP-A-0 535 422. In an electric power steering apparatus, steering 
torque is detected so as to assist a steering power by using 
the rotation power of a motor driven in accordance with the 
detected torque. FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of the configuration 
of the electric power steering apparatus. The output 
from a torque sensor 2 provided on a steering shaft (not 
shown) is inputted to a CPU 1 via an interface 3. The 
output is subjected to A/D conversion 11 and then phase 
compensation 12 in the CPU 1. The CPU 1 stores, in its 
memory, an target current table 13 regarding the relationship 
between the detected torque and an target current value 
for driving a motor 5 as shown in FIG. 2, and reads the 
target current value corresponding to the detected torque 
from the table 13. The output resulting from the A/D  
 
conversion 11 is also subjected to differentiation 18, and 
addition 14 of the differentiated value and the target 
current value is performed for compensation of the inertia 
of the motor 5. Then, deviation 15 between the result of the addition 
14 and a feedback value of the driving current for the motor 
5, which is detected by a driving current detection circuit 
6 and is subjected to A/D conversion 19 in the CPU 1, is 
obtained. The CPU 1 then performs PI calculation 16 of the 
result of the deviation 15 to obtain a control volume, and 
generates a PWM wave signal 17 and a signal indicating the 
rotation direction of the motor 5 in accordance with the 
control volume. These signals are supplied to a drive 
circuit 4 including an H-type bridge of four switch transistors 
as well as to the motor 5. Although it is not shown 
in FIG. 1, speed information detected by a speed sensor is 
also inputted to the CPU 1, and the target current value 
corresponding to the detected speed is read from the table 
13. Such an electric power steering apparatus also includes 
an inhibition circuit 7 for restricting the driving direction 
of the motor 5 as countermeasure using hardware against 
runaway of the CPU 1. By the inhibition circuit 7, the 
motor 5 is inhibited to be driven when the direction of the 
detected torque and the driving direction of the motor 5 are  
 
different from each other, thereby preventing an unforeseen 
accident from occurring. Actually, the motor 5 is inhibited 
to be driven also in a dead zone shown in
