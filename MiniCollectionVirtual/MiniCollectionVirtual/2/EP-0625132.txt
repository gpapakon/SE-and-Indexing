<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the oligomerization of C2-C12-alkenes, an alkene-containing feedstock having a water content of from 0.05 to 0.25 molar %, based on the hydrocarbon content of the feedstock, is passed over a zeolite catalyst. Improved alkene conversion and catalyst life are obtained compared to processes in which non-hydrated feedstocks are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oligomerisation of alkenes and 
to catalysts used in alkene oligomerisation processes in 
particular for the production of C5 to C15 olefins which may 
be subsequently subject to hydroformylation for the production 
of aldehydes and alcohols themselves useful in the production 
of plasticiser esters, mercaptans and surfactants. In one form of olefin oligomerisation a solid phosphoric acid 
catalyst is used as catalyst. A significant amount of cracked 
products is produced, the phosphoric acid catalyst is not 
regenerable and its disposal in an environmentally acceptable 
manner is difficult and expensive. Zeolite catalysts of many types have been proposed for the 
conversion of lower molecular weight olefins (that is, olefins 
having up to twelve carbon atoms) into olefinic hydrocarbons 
of higher molecular weight. The higher molecular weight 
olefins may be used in a variety of chemical processes, for 
example, in the manufacture of fuel oil, synthetic lubricants, 
alcohols, plasticisers and mercaptans. International Patent Application WO 89/07586 discloses a 
process for conversion of a fuel gas containing ethene and 
propene and a catalytic reformate containing C6 to C8 aromatic 
hydrocarbons into hydrocarbon products of higher molecular 
weight. The fuel gas and reformate feedstocks are contacted 
at elevated temperature and pressure with a zeolite catalyst, 
which may be of the ZSM-5 type. If ZSM-5 pentasil type 
crystals are used, the catalyst crystals preferably have a 
size of from 0.01 to over 2 microns. WO 89/07586 indicates 
that the zeolites ZSM-22 and ZSM-23 may be used. US Patent 4868146 discloses a catalyst having a crystalline 
metallosilicate inner core and an inactive porous shell, which 
may be used, for example, to catalyse the oligomerisation of  
 
lower olefins. Highly siliceous zeolites, including, for 
example, ZSM-22, may be used. US Patent 4788374 similarly 
discloses an olefin oligomerisation catalyst having a 
crystalline metallosilicate core and a porous shell. European Specification 377306 discloses a process in which 
branched internal olefins are co-oligomerised with alphaolefins 
to give a synthetic lube-range product. In a first 
step, propene is converted by contact with a zeolite catalyst 
of the ZSM-5 type to a mixture of oligomers. In a number of 
the Examples a ZSM-23 catalyst that has been prepared in 
accordance with US Patent 4160788 is used. European Specifications 276095, 323032 and 318132 disclose 
processes for oligomerising
