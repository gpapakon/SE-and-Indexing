<ABSTRACT>
A method for engine retardation with a multi-cylinder combustion engine, which for each cylinder with matching piston has an exhaust valve for control of the connection between a combustion chamber (4) in the cylinder and an exhaust system. Opening of the exhaust valve for engine retardation is achieved by regulation of a clearance in the engine valve mechanism and thereby engaging one or more extra cam ridges (38) on the engine camshaft (10), which continuously activates the valve mechanism in dependence of the momentary position of the engine crankshaft, using an actively adjustable, hydraulically operated clearance regulating device (16). For active control of the engine retardation said device is adjusted between different positions by means of a hydraulic fluid pressure lower than a maximum value controlled by a pressure relief valve (25). The angular position of the camshaft, at which the exhaust valves are being opened by said extra cam ridge or ridges is depending on the momentary clearance in the valve mechanism. The clearance is gradually brought to zero or close to zero while the pressure in the corresponding clearance regulating device (16) is limited to a certain predetermined value. Independently of when in time during the cylinder work cycle the engine retardation is initiated or terminated, the risk of an opening against a, from a stress aspect, too high cylinder pressure is hereby eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for engine retardation
with a multi-cylinder combustion engine, which
for each cylinder with matching piston has at least one
exhaust valve for control of the connection between a
combustion chamber in the cylinder and an exhaust system,
whereby the combustion chamber is connected to the exhaust
system through opening of the exhaust valve at least when
the piston in the cylinder is in the so called compression
phase, said opening being achieved by a change of clearance
in the valve mechanism of the combustion engine, thereby
activating one or more extra cam ridges on the camshaft of
the engine, which continuously activates the valve
mechanism in dependence of the momentary position of the
engine crankshaft through an actively adjustable,
hydraulically operated clearance regulating device, which
for active control of the engine retardation is adjusted
between different positions by means of a hydraulic fluid
pressure, whereby the angular camshaft position at which
the exhaust valves are opened by the said extra cam ridge
or ridges is dependent on the momentary clearance in the
valve mechanism.The present invention also concerns a device for realization
of the method for engine retardation with a multi-cylinder
combustion engine, which for each cylinder with
matching piston has at least one exhaust valve for control
of the connection between a combustion chamber in the
cylinder and an exhaust system, whereby the combustion
chamber is connected to the exhaust system through opening
of the exhaust valve at least when the piston in the
cylinder is in the so called compression phase, said
opening being achieved by a change of clearance in the 
valve mechanism of the combustion engine, thereby activating
one or more extra cam ridges on the camshaft of the
engine, which continuously activates the valve mechanism in
dependence of the momentary position of the engine
crankshaft through an actively adjustable, hydraulically
operated clearance regulating device, which for active
control of the engine retardation is arranged to be
adjusted by a hydraulic fluid pressure staying below a
maximum value controlled by a pressure relief valve, whereby
the camshaft angular position at which the exhaust
valves are opened by the said extra cam ridge or ridges is
dependent on the momentary clearance in the valve
mechanism.Especially for heavier vehicles, there are high demands on
efficient engine retardation, which thereby reduces the
wear on the wheel brakes and thus improves the

<CLAIMS>
A method for engine retardation in a multi-cylinder
combustion engine including a crankshaft, a plurality of

cylinders (2), a plurality of corresponding pistons (3) for
said plurality of cylinders, at least one exhaust valve (7)

for regulating the connection between said plurality of cylinders and an
engine exhaust system (8), a valve control mechanism

including at least one camshaft for continuously
controlling said exhaust valves (7) in response to the

position of said crankshaft, said at least one camshaft
including at least one extra cam ridge, said method

comprising selectively opening said exhaust valves at least
when said pistons corresponding to said plurality of

cylinders, are in their compression phase before reaching
an upper dead point, by hydraulically controlling the

clearance in said valve control mechanism in response to a
hydraulic fluid pressure up to a maximum pressure value

controlled by a pressure relief valve, said at least one
extra cam ridge enabling said exhaust valve to be opened

when said clearance in said valve control mechanism, gets
smaller than the height of said extra cam ridge
characterized in
 that the pressure in said
hydraulic fluid, controlling said clearance, is limited to

a predetermined pressure value chosen so that said pressure
relief valve is opened when the extra cam ridge tries to

open the said exhaust valve at a moment close to the upper
dead point thereby reducing the risk of opening sai

least one exhaust valve during a cylinder pressure greater

than a predetermined cylinder pressure. 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
, said hydraulically
controlling said clearance in said valve control mechanism

comprises controlling the fluid pressure between a
hydraulic fluid source connected to said valve control

mechanism and said fluid pressure in said valve control
mechanism.
Method according to claim 2,
characterized in that
, said engine
includes a plurality of valve control mechanisms, and

including separately hydraulically controlling said
clearance in each of said plurality of valve control

mechanisms based upon the differences between said fluid
pressure in said hydraulic fluid source and the fluid

pressure in each of said valve control mechanisms.
