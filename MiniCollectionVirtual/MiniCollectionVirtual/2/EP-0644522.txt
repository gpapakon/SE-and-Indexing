<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data selection 
circuit of 1/n Duty-1/m Bias activating scheme (wherein 
n ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2). A data selection circuit is known from 
IMB Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 27, No. 18, June 
1984, pages 651-652, for use in a multiplexer. The data selection circuit according to the present 
invention is provided preferably for a liquid crystal 
display (hereinafter referred to as LCD) of 1/n Duty-1/m 
Bias activating scheme.  
 In the LCD, data, information etc. are displayed 
based on the combinations of activation and deactivation 
of the segments which are arranged separately on the LCD 
panel. As an LCD activating method, a 1/n Duty-1/m Bias 
activating scheme is well known. In this scheme, a 
segment signal (hereinafter referred to as a SEG signal) 
commonly supplied to n segments is used for driving n 
segments among all of the segments of the LCD, and the 
activation of each segment is controlled by switching 
the segment signal to m power source voltage levels, at 
preset timings based on 2n combinations of ON/OFF states 
which are supplied to the n segments. For instance, 1/2 
Duty-1/2 Bias scheme, 1/3 Duty-1/3 Bias scheme, 1/4 
Duty-1/4 Bias scheme, etc. are used. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a general structure 
of an LCD driving circuit using a 1/3 Duty-1/3 Bias 
activating scheme. A timing signal generation circuit 
105 generates timing signals D00 to D37. A data selection 
circuit 100 generates output signals GO to G3 
according to input n-bit select data, for example, 3-bit 
select data and a timing signal to turn ON/OFF analog 
switches 101 to 104. Each of the analog switches 101 to  
 
104 is connected correspondingly to one of three types 
(m = 3) of power sources, in which a power source 
voltage of V0 is used as a reference level. A COM 
signal creation circuit 106 generates COM signals which 
are inherent to respective segments as will be described 
later. For example, N data selection circuits 100 and N 
COM signal creation circuits 106 are provided according 
to the LCD panel. FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram showing a construction 
of the conventional data selection circuit 100. Now, 
the conventional LCD driving circuit, particularly, a 
data selection circuit is explained. As shown in 
FIG. 2, the data selection circuit 100 includes a large 
number of NAND circuits and NOT circuits. A case 
wherein the LCD driving circuit drives three segments 
121 to 123 in the seven-segment display device shown in 
FIG. 3 will be explained. The data selection
