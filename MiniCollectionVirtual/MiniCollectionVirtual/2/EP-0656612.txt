<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for wireless remote control. 

A transmitter (1) with no batteries 
receives its operating power 

from a generator (3) which produces 
electric energy inductively upon 

turning or pressing an operating element 
(4) manually. The same operating 

element can also be used for determining 
the direction and degree of 

control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for wireless
remote control, wherein the electric power required by a
transmitter supplying a control signal in a wireless manner
to a remote controlled apparatus is produced by means of a
generator provided with an operating element which is operated
by the action of physical force from the operator.Us 4 471 353 discloses a push-button operated electrical
power source for a wireless remote control which is operated
by physical force of the operator. The generated current is
sufficient to operate an infrared pulse-coded optical transmitter
for a short time period during which a preset signal
is sent to a remote receiver. Because enough energy is produced
while operating the switch there is no additional power
source like an accumulator or a battery needed.It is a drawback of the known apparatus that the operator is
merely able to start and stop the transmitter and to start
and stop thereby the remote device receiving preprogrammed
data from the transmitter. Except of switching to the binary
states on" and off" the operator has no additional influence
on the data sent by the transmitter. Particularly he is
not able to determine the speed, direction or extent of the
function of the receiving unit with the push-button switch.
The operator has to select the desired function by turning a 
selector wheel first and afterwards he has to activate the
transmitter by pushing the button. Functions which require a
quick reaction of the operator can not be controlled by the
known apparatus because the necessary series of steps of selecting
and transmitting data take too much time.In the invention, these problems have been solved by fitting
a control-signal transmitter with a manually operated mini-generator
for producing necessary electrical energy for
transmitting a control signal. The characterizing features of
the invention are set forth in the appended claims.The invention can be applied for example in the control
and/or regulation of lights. When studying the application of
the invention, it was observed that the energy required for
turning the knob or pressing the button of a normal light
regulator is well sufficient for producing e.g. an infrared
transmission. Therefore, it is possible to design a remote
control transmitter which resembles a normal minicontroller
and also feels that way in handling but can be installed
freely without wires almost anywhere.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference
made to the accompanying drawings, in
