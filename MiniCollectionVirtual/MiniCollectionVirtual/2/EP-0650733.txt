<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to 
modified microorganisms suitable for use as live 
in 
ovo
 vaccines for avian species. The live 
in ovo
 
vaccines of the present invention are useful for 

inducing immunity before or immediately after hatching 
against a virulent form of the modified microorganism 

or a microorganism immunologically related to the 
modified microorganism or a virulent organism or virus 

carrying an antigenic determinant expressed by the 
modified microorganism in the live vaccine. The 

subject live 
in ovo
 vaccines are particularly 
efficacious in enhancing the survival rate of newly-hatched 

poultry birds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
modified microorganisms suitable for use as live in
ovo vaccines for avian species. The live in ovo
vaccines of the present invention are useful for
inducing immunity before or immediately after hatching
against a virulent form of the modified microorganism
or a microorganism immunologically related to the
modified microorganism or a virulent organism or virus
carrying an antigenic determinant expressed by the
modified microorganism in the live vaccine. The
subject live in ovo vaccines are particularly
efficacious in enhancing the survival rate of newly-hatched
poultry birds.Infection of avian species by
microorganisms, viruses, helminths, yeasts and
protozoans can have serious environmental, ecological
and commercial implications. Not only are the birds
themselves at risk, but there is also the potential of
the infecting agent to spread to other animals,
including humans.The poultry industry is particularly
vulnerable to significant economic losses due to the
susceptibility of stock birds, and in particular
newly-hatched stock birds, to rapidly spreading
infections. In poultry birds, infection by Salmonella
species, generally referred to as salmonellosis, is 
the most common form of infection-causing high
mortality rates. Many species of Salmonella also
cause infection in humans and other animals and,
hence, control of salmonellosis in poultry birds is of
particular importance. Two of the most common species
of Salmonella isolated from poultry birds are
Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis.
Both organisms contribute significantly to the
outbreaks of salmonellosis and, in fact, S.
enteritidis phage type 4 emerged as a significant
threat to public health in Britain during the mid
1980's.Chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis have been
used as forms of protective measures to combat poultry
diseases such as salmonellosis. However, such
measures are not always successful, are quite
expensive, may lead to the development of drug
resistance amongst infecting agents and are not
necessarily acceptable to public health authorities
for birds destined for human or animal consumption.
For these and other related reasons, alternative forms
of protection for avian species have been the subject
of intense scientific research.One form of protection proposed is the
development of vaccines against poultry diseases.
Live attenuated Salmonella vaccines have been shown to
protect chickens (Cooper et al., Microb. Pathog., 9:
255-265, 1990; Hassan and Curtiss III, Res.
