<ABSTRACT>
An assembly which serves for conveying washing liquid out of a supply tank (10) to a washing nozzle (42) directed onto a window of a motor vehicle is proposed. The conveying assembly comprises an electric drive motor (16) for a conveying pump (24) which has a conveying member (28) connected operatively to the armature shaft of the electric motor and rotating in a pumping chamber (22), and the pumping chamber is conductively connected to the supply tank (10) via a suction conduit and to the washing nozzle (42) via a delivery conduit. An especially intensive cleaning of the window subjected to the washing jet is achieved if there is arranged in front of the conveying pump (24), as seen in the direction of flow of the washing liquid, a pre-conveying pump (34) which is designed as a flow pump and a conveying member (32) of which rotates in a pre-pumping chamber (36) which is conductively connected to the pumping chamber (22) of the conveying pump (24) by means of an overflow channel (64), because the two-stage pump thus formed applies the washing liquid with higher pressure to the window to be cleaned.

Unit for delivering washer liquid from a supply 
tank (10) to a washer nozzle (42) which is directed onto 

a window (44) of a motor vehicle, having an electric 
drive motor (16) which is connected to a. delivery pump 

(24) which has a delivery member (28) which is 
operatively connected to the armature shaft (20) of the 

electric motor (16) and rotates in a pumping chamber 
(22), and the pumping chamber (22) is connected for 

channelling action to the supply tank (10) via a suction 
line (12) and to the washer nozzle (42) via a pressure 

line (40), characterized in that an initial delivery pump 
(34), which is designed as a flow pump, is arranged 

upstream of the delivery pump (24), as seen in the flow 
direction (70, 72, 74, 76) of the washer liquid, and the 

delivery member (32) of said initial delivery pump 
rotates in an initial pump chamber (36) which is connected 

for channelling action to the pumping chamber (22) 
of the delivery pump (24) via an overflow duct (64), in 

that a partition wall (48) is arranged between the 
pumping chamber (22) of the delivery pump (24) and the 

initial pump chamber (36) of the initial delivery pump 
(34) and rests against housing parts (18, 26), bounding 

the chambers (22, 36) radially and has a central through-passage 
(60) belonging to the overflow duct (64), in that 

the delivery member (28), which is designed as an impeller, 
of the delivery pump (24) has an extension (30) 

which is directed counter to the flow direction of the 
washer liquid, and in that the delivery member (28) has 

a conical extension (31) which converges in the direction  
 

from the blades (29) to the extension (30) and, when the 
pump has been assembled, is located in an opening (62) of 

a flow-channelling element (56) of the initial pump 
chamber (36). 
Unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the delivery pump (24) is designed as a flow pump. 
Unit according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a disc-shaped flow-channelling element 

(56) is arranged between the delivery member (32) of the 
initial delivery pump (34) and the end surface (52), 

facing said delivery member, of the partition wall (48) 
and has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the 

essentially circular initial pump chamber (36) and is 
fixed at a distance from the partition wall (48). 
Unit according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the flow-channelling element (56) is supported on the 

partition wall (48) via essentially radially aligned ribs 
(54). 
Unit according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the ribs (54) are connected integrally to the partition 

wall (48) and to the flow-channelling element (56). 
Unit according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the extension (30) extends through 

central bores (60, 62) in the partition wall (48) and the 
flow-channelling element (56) and serves as a rotary 

driver for the delivery member (32) of the initial 
delivery pump (34). 
Unit according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the delivery member (32), which is designed as an impeller, 

of the initial delivery pump (34) is fitted onto the 
extension (30).
