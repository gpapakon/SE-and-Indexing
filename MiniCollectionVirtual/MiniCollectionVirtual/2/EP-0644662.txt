<ABSTRACT>
A radio system has a detector detecting a required 
radio program, and supplying an instruction signal when the 

program is detected thereby. In accordance with the instruction 
signal, a recording unit begins to record the program.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio which may
record radio programs, and more particularly to an improved
radio by which broadcasted programs may be easily reproduced at
need.Radios have the advantage that a variety of information
may be acquired, with doing something, for example, driving
cars. However, people tend to easily miss important
information, such as traffic information, weather information
and the like.In order to solve the above mentioned problem,
traditionally, the currently broadcasted program is recorded on
a tape and is reproduced at need. The speed of rewinding the
tape is faster than that for reproducing, so that the
reproduction program may overtake the currently broadcasted
program.According to the conventional radio, however, there is
a disadvantage in that only currently broadcasted program may be
recorded. Therefore, if a listener misses to tune the radio to
the needed program or misses to turn on the radio itself, needed
information may not be acquired quickly . The document DE 9109796 U1 which has been used to formulate the preamble part of patent
claim 1 discloses a radio with recording and reproducing function and with a receiving unit for
receiving radio waves in a predetermined range of frequency to generate sound signals. A
recording and reproducing unit is provided for operating in a recording mode in which said
sound signals are recorded on a recording medium, for example a magnetic tape cassette, a
compact disc or a digital memory means, in a predetermined period, and for operating in a reproduction
mode in which said sound signals recorded on the recording medium are reproduced. Amplifier
and loudspeakers are provided for amplifying sound signals from the receiving unit and
reproduced signals from the recording and reproducing unit to generate audible sound. A controller
controls the modes of the recording and reproducing unit in accordance with instructions
of the recording and reproduction modes. A timer is provided for storing broadcast messages
at predetermined times without operating the radio and the amplifier or loudspeaker,
respectively. The timer can be operated with and without a tuner to record information automatically
when the radio wave of traffic information is received.Another radio is described in DE 41 18 970 A1.EP 0 203 797 discloses in an apparatus for recording and/or reproducing a digital signal to
transport the recording medium at a high speed to reproduce programs other then the predetermined
programs and to reproduce predetermined programs
</DESCRIPTION>
