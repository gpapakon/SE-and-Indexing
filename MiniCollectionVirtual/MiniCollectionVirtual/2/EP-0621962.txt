<DESCRIPTION>
 - 1 -FUNCΉONALIZED MEROCYANINE DYES AND POLYMERS INCORPORAΉNG SUCH DYES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 51. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to merocyanine dyes comprising rhodanine, barbituric acid, thiobarbituric acid, and isoxazolone groups, condensation polymers and (meth)acrylated polymers incorporating such dyes, the dyes and 10 polymers being useful in nonlinear-optical applications.2. Description of the Related ArtSeveral polymers have been reported in the literature for use as active nonlinear-optical (NLO) compositions, see for example Nonlinear-optical Properties of Organic Material 1147 (Khanarian, G., ed., SPIE Proc., San15 Diego, 1989). Most of them are linear polymers bearing NLO-active groups (hereinafter for brevity referred to as "nonlineaphores") as side chains, in which the aligned dipoles tend to relax over extended periods of time at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures. Some of the noted exceptions are the acrylates/methacrylates reported by Man et al. Proc. SPIE-Intl. Soc'y20 Opt. Eng. 1213 (Photopolym. Device Phys., Chem., Appl., 1990); and polyurethanes reported in U.S. Patent No. 5,001,209 (Wreesman et al.). These polymers have glass transition temperatures (Tg), above 135°C and are reported to be stable at elevated temperatures.Recently, an increasing number of publications have appeared in which25 the issue of elevated temperature stability is being addressed by use of cross-linked polymers. These polymers can be divided into two classes, namely, those cross-linked around the NLO units, to restrict the free volume available for relaxation of the NLO moiety, and those cross-linked through the NLO units, to covalently bind the NLO moiety of the NLO unit at more than one30 point.U.S. Patent No. 4,886,339 (Scozzafava et al.) describes one example of the former case. The disadvantage of this system is that a binder is needed to 

make a film of the monomer prior to poling/cross-linking and the reaction has to be carried out in an inert atmosphere. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the resulting polymer will have a high enough cross-link density to prevent all rotation of the dipoles since the molecule is covalently bound only at one point. As reported by Park et al. Chem. Mater. 2 119 (1990), this type of cross-linking does provide some enhanced stability of the NLO moiety over versions that are not cross-linked but long term relaxation is still a problem.Eich et al. J. Appl. Phys. 663241 (1989), have addressed the relaxation problem by utilizing
