<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain heterocyclic 
compounds, in particular, certain 1-pyridylacetamide compounds, which 
are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human 
neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition 
is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic 
and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in 
which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid 
arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other 
inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory diseases 
characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such as 
chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been implicated 
in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and their 
therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or implicated, 
for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute non-lymphocytic 
leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated with, for 
example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions associated with 
coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, cerebrovascular 
ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and stroke, peripheral 
occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent claudication and 
critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as venous 
hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as 
impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with 
reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The 
invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these 
heterocyclic compounds, processes for preparing the heterocyclic 
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such heterocyclic 
compounds and methods for their use. In U.S. Patent 4,910,190, of 20 March 1990, assigned to ICI 
Americas Inc. (now Zeneca Inc.), there is disclosed a series of 
peptidoyl trifluoromethane derivatives which are HLE inhibitors. In EP-A-509769 there is disclosed a series of 1-pyridylacetamide compounds 
which are HLE inhibitors. Disclosed herein is a series of substituted 2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1-pyridyl)-N-[3,3,3-trifluoro-1-(lower 
alkyl)-2-oxopropyl]acetamide 
derivatives, which unexpectedly possess inhibitory properties against  
 
HLE, which provides the basis for the present invention. According to the invention there is provided a Compound of 
the invention which is a compound of formula I (formula set out,
