<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the better utilisation of the working width of a profiling block (1) in the inner profiling of heat exchanger tubes (5). The width of contact (7) of the revolving rolling elements (6) is significantly less than the profiled width of the profiling block, with the result that the profiling block wears rapidly in this region while the remaining region remains unworn and therefore unused. In order to avoid this, the invention proposes that the contact-pressure rollers and the profiling block should be moved backwards and forwards axially within the range of the working width of the profiling block, thereby allowing the entire profiling region of the profiling block to be used.

Method of profiling the inside of tubes (5) by means of a profiling stone (1) 
arranged coaxially inside the tube which has a cylindrical enveloping surface 

which faces the inner tube wall (2) in working position, whereby the surface 
surrounded by the enveloping surface comprises a surface profiling (3) suitable 

for forming the inner profiling and whereby several rolling elements (6) arranged 
on the outer periphery (4) of the tube (5) are provided, which press the tube (5) in 

a working region (7) against the surface profiling (3) of the profiling stone (1), 
which hereby perform a peripheral movement around the tube (5), whilst the tube 

(5) is moved axially simultaneously, characterised in that during this movement 
the profiling stone (1) and rolling element (6) swing to and fro periodically axially 

relative to one another without the working region (7) leaving the region of the 
surface profiling (3) of the profiling stone (1). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the relative speed between the 
profiling stone (1) and rolling element (6) in the opposite direction to the axial 

movement (8) of the tube (5) is equal to, slower or faster than in the opposite 
direction. 
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the axial relative 
movement between the profiling stone (1) and the rolling element (6) is produced 

by a corresponding axial movement of the rolling element (6), whilst the profiling 
stone (1) maintains its position relative to the environment. 
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the axial relative 
movement between the profiling stone (1) and the rolling elements (6) is produced 

by a corresponding axial movement of the profiling stone, whilst the rolling 
elements (6) maintain their position relative to the environment.  

 
Device for carrying out the method according to one of claims 1 or 4 with a 
drawing head (15) comprising a drawing die (9) and a drawing device for 

transporting the tube (5) in drawing direction (8), whereby a drawing mandrel (13) 
is provided assigned to the drawing die (9), which comprises a ram (14) arranged 

coaxially, at the free end of which a profiling stone (1) is arranged and with a 
rolling head (10) with rolling elements (6) which are rotatably mounted about their 

own axis (11) and in addition about a common axis (12) with the tube (5) to be 
worked, characterised in that the rolling elements (6) alone or together with the 

other rolling head (10) and/or the drawing die (9) alone or together with the other 
drawing head (15) are designed power-operated with a desired stroke and a 

desired speed to be able to move to and fro periodically axially, whereby the 
profiling stone (1) is arranged rotatably and axially secured in both directions on 

the ram (14). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the rolling elements (6) are 
mounted hydrostatically. 
Device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the rolling elements (6) are 
designed to be adjustable in radial position within a given working range (7).
