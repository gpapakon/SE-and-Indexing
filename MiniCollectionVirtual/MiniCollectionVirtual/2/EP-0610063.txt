<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of enzymes to regioselectively
deacylate sucrose esters in anhydrous organic solvents.The artificial sweetener 4,1',6'-trichloro-4,1',6'-trideoxy-galactosucrose
("sucralose") is derived from sucrose by replacing
the hydroxyls in the 4, 1', and 6' positions with chlorine. (In the
process of making the sweetener, the stereo configuration at the 4
position is reversed - hence the compound is a galactosucrose.)
The direction of the chlorine atoms to only the desired positions
is a major synthesis problem because the hydroxyls that are replaced
are of differing reactivity; two are primary and one is secondary.
The synthesis is further complicated by the fact that the primary
hydroxyl in the 6 position is unsubstituted in the final product.This invention provides an improved route to sucrose esters
wherein the ester groups are bonded to predetermined positions on
the sucrose molecule. In one aspect, the invention provides an
improved route to 2,3,4,3',4'penta-O-acetylsucrose ("4-PAS") or
2,3,6,3',4'-penta-O-acetylsucrose ("6-PAS") or both, which can be
employed to produce sucralose. 4-PAS is readily rearranged to 6-PAS,
which can be chlorinated and then deacylated to produce
sucralose.The invention provides a process for the preparation of
partially acylated derivatives of sucrose by the enzyme catalyzed 
deacylation of sucrose esters, wherein said process comprises
treating a sucrose ester selected from the group consisting of
sucrose octaacylate, sucrose heptaacylate, and sucrose hexaacylate
in an anhydrous organic medium (as defined herein), with an enzyme
or combination of enzymes capable of catalyzing the deacylation of
said sucrose ester to produce a partially deacylated sucrose
derivative having free hydroxyl group(s) in pre-selected position(s),
and recovering the resulting partially deacylated sucrose
derivative.Bornemann et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,141,860 (and in
GB 2 224 504 A), disclose a process whereby sucrose octaesters are
enzymatically deacylated in aqueous media to produce various
partially deacylated sucrose esters.The preparation of hepta-, hexa-, and/or penta-O-acetylsucroses
by enzymatic hydrolysis in aqueous media (which may be biphasic) of
octa-O-acetylsucrose is disclosed by Chang et al. in J. Carbohydrate
Chemistry,10(2), 251-261 (1991) and in Carbohydrate Research,222,
121-129 (1991); Kloosterman et al., J. Carbohydrate Chemistry, 8(5),
