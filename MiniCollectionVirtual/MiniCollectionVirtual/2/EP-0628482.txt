<ABSTRACT>
A biaxially oriented blow-moulded bottle-shaped container 
made of synthetic resin, the container comprising a rectangular 

cylindrical body (2) including flat walls (6). Each of the flat 
walls (6) has a central recessed portion (7) having a bottom wall 

comprising a shaped panel wall (8) for taking up deformation due 
to reduced pressure in the container (1), and a shaped peripheral 

groove (9) invertedly curved around the shaped panel wall (8). 
The shaped panel wall (8) has ribs (21) traversing the shaped 

panel wall (8) in parallel to each other, a crest (22) of each 
of the ribs (21) having a larger radius of curvature than that 

of a root (23) thereof. Opposite ends of the root (23) are 
shallow along a large radius of curvature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a large bottle made
of synthetic resin, especially to the body wall structure
of a large square bottle made of polyethene terephthalate
(hereinafter referred to as "PET") biaxially oriented blow-moulded,
and to the structure from a body upper end to a
shoulder and the wall structure of a ridge-line portion,
which gives a serious influence upon the external
appearance and configuration of a bottle by bending and
connecting two wall surface portions.The biaxial oriented blow-moulded bottle of polyethene
terephthalate resin is excellent in various durabilities
with respect to for instance contents, chemicals, weather,
or further shock resistance and the like, and has high
mechanical strength, transparency, no pollution and further
gas barrier properties. Therefore, such a bottle has been
used on a large scale for containing various kinds of
liquids.Such a PET biaxial oriented blow-moulded large bottle
does not have sufficient mechanical strength in its body,
such as self configuration sustaining capability or
buckling strength, since the body wall as a main portion of
the bottle is thin in thickness. Particularly, a bottle
having a square cylindrical body is poor not only in
buckling strength but also in self configuration sustaining
capability. Therefore, there are inconveniences such as a
large incorrect depressed deformation on the body caused by 
negative pressure generated within the bottle after a
liquid is contained and sealed therein.In order to solve such an inconvenience in such a
square-shaped PET bottle, a central circumferential groove
is provided at substantially the centre of the body for
increasing buckling strength against any depression force
applied on the bottle from the outside, and increasing the
self configuration sustaining capability of the body
against external force applied in the diametrical
direction. At the central portion of a flat wall divided
into the upper and lower portions by the central
circumferential groove there is provided a recessed portion
having a depression deformable shaped panel wall as a
bottom wall for taking up the negative pressure generated
in the bottle by a certain depression deformation of the
shaped panel wall to prevent any incorrect depression
deformation from occurring in the body, and increasing self
configuration sustaining capability of the flat wall
portion.The increase of mechanical configuration sustaining
capability by providing the central circumferential groove
and the recessed portion formed in the shaped
