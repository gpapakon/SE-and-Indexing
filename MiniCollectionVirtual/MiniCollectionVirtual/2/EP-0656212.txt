<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to cyclosporin-containing liquid compositions for oral or parenteral administration and to a process for their preparation. The compositions contain beside the active ingredient cyclosporin a polyoxyethylene glycerol fatty acid monoester and a mono- and/or polyhydric alcohol(s). These compositions are stable, well tolerated and have better bioavailability than the products disclosed to date.

the active ingredient in combination with a polyoxyethylene glycerol fatty acid monoester and

one or more monovalent and/or polyvalent alcohol(s), whereby compressed gas aerosol
dispensers are excluded.
Liquid preparations according to claim 1, which contain esters of lauric, stearic, oleic
or isostearic acid as the polyoxyethylene glycerol fatty acid monoester.
Liquid preparations according to claim 2, in which the polyoxyethylene glycerol fatty
acid monoester is a monoester of oleic or lauric acid.
Pharmaceutical preparations according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the
components: active ingredient, PGFME and alcohol are present in a ratio of 1:1-20:0.5-20,

preferably 1:10-20:2-10, especially 1:12-18:3-6.
Pharmaceutical preparations according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which the alcohol
component in question is ethanol, propylene glycol and/or polyethylene glycol with a

which the components are mixed at temperatures of 20 to 50Â°C and then filled into suitable

containers.
Pharmaceutical preparation according to one of claims 1 to 6, processed into soft
gelatin capsules.
Usage of a pharmaceutical preparation according to one of claims 1 to 6 or 8 in the
preparation of a medicament for therapeutic usage, such as for organ transplantations, as

anti-inflammatory agents, for parasitic diseases, arthritic diseases, rheumatic diseases. 
Usage of a pharmaceutical preparation according to one of claims 1 to 6 for the
preparation of a medicament for therapeutic usage, such as for organ transplantations,

whereby the pharmaceutical preparation is processed into soft gelatin capsules.
