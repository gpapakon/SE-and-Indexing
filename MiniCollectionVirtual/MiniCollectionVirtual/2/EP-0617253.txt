<ABSTRACT>
The measuring device has a sensor (detecting element) (40) arranged on the end of, and axially parallel with, a drive arm which can be moved in a translatory and rotatory fashion by means of drive motors. The sensor has a probe (16) for scanning the geometry of cylinder walls. The sensor comprises a measuring member (42) with a holder for clamping the probe, which is constructed as an elongated feeler, in a flexurally rigid and axially fixed manner. The measuring member is firmly clamped in a scanning head (15) at a distance from the holder of the probe in the region of a mounting section (46) and is also provided with at least one weakening zone which is arranged between the holder and the mounting section. Strain gauges are stuck on in the region of this zone for the purpose of detecting deformations occurring during the measurement operation.

body (42, 142) is provided with at least two spring portions (60, 60'; 61, 61'; 62, 62' or 161,

161'; 162, 162'), which are arranged at a spacing one from the other and effective each at
right angles to the other.
Measuring device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that parallel

springs (60, 60'; 61, 61'; 62, 62' or 161, 161'; 162, 162') are concerned in the case of the
spring portions.
Measuring device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby, that
the measuring body (42, 142) is formed in one piece.
Measuring device according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the measuring
body (42, 142) displays a C-shaped configuration with a web (45, 145) connecting two

limbs (43, 44; 143; 144) each with the other as well as a fastening portion (46, 146), which
extends forth from that end of the one limb (43, 143), which is remote from the web, that

the limb (44, 144) lying opposite this limb is provided with the mount for the clamping-in of
the tracing member (16) and that the web and/or the first-mentioned limb comprise

weakened zones formed as spring portions (60, 60'; 61, 61'; 62, 62' or 161, 161'; 162,
162'). 
Measuring device according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that in the region of
the weakened zones formed as spring portions, the web (45, 145) and/or the one limb (43,

143) of the measuring body is penetrated by cut-outs (63, 64, 65; 164, 165) whilst leaving
leafspring-like rim regions.
Measuring device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised thereby, that the web
(42), which connects both the limbs (43, 44) each with the other, of the measuring body

(42) is penetrated by two cut-outs (63, 64), which each extend at a right angle to the other
and are arranged each at a spacing from the other in the longitudinal direction of the web.
Measuring device according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterised thereby, that
the cut-out (65, 165) in the limb (43, 143), which connects the fastening portion (46, 146)
