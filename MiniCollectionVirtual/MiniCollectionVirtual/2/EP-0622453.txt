<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of the microencapsulation process for obtaining stable mixtures of powders which are chemically incompatible with each other, by virtue of the use of a microencapsulation product which is inert with respect to the other constituents. The mixtures are produced with chlorinated products derived from isocyanuric acid and fragrant (aromatic) essential oils. The latter are enclosed in the microcapsules produced by means of products such as starch which form the shell of the microcapsule and which prevent or limit contact of these oils with the chlorinated product. In the presence of water, all these products dissolve and the oxidation reaction no longer takes place. The solution thus prepared contains fragrant hypochlorite ions, just like ready-to-use bleach, whose unpleasant smell is masked by the fragrance.
