<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for controlling an extinction ratio of a laser whose temperature can change over time includes first and second feedback loops which monitor a LOW output power of the laser during a first frame training pulse and a HIGH laser output power during a second frame training pulse. The LOW power output is compared to a preset dynamic LOW power reference, and a LOW bias current applied to the laser is incrementally increased or decreased so as to keep this LOW power output toggling about this LOW reference. Similarly, the HIGH power output is compared to a HIGH power reference, and a modulation current for the laser is incrementally increased or decreased to keep the HIGH laser output power toggling about this HIGH reference. Preferably, the training pulse is sent once per frame thus enabling both the LOW and HIGH laser output powers to be kept constant regardless of whatever dynamic variables may change over time thus keeping the laser extinction ratio constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling an
output of a laser diode over temperature so as to control and optimally
maintain constant its extinction ratio, and a method for initially setting
HIGH and LOW outputs of the laser diode so as to have a desired
extinction ratio.Various control circuits have been proposed in the prior art for
maintaining an output of a laser diode. FIG 1 illustrates various
characteristic curves for a laser diode whereby current I versus power
P is graphed, the three curves illustrating data for a laser diode at three
distinct temperatures. As is evident and known, a pedestal bias current
4 of the laser diode increases with temperature. One method of
controlling an output of a laser diode is to incorporate a thermoelectric
cooler into a laser package so as to keep the diode at a constant
temperature so that its pedestal bias current remains constant.
Accordingly, an extinction ratio of the laser diode, defined as the ratio
between its HIGH power output divided by its LOW power output can
easily be maintained constant. A disadvantage of such proposals is that
thermoelectric cooler designs tend to increase the laser cost, and
decreases reliability of the laser diode since any failure in the
thermoelectric cooler device or its circuitry will result in the applied
bias current being inappropriate as the temperature of the laser diode
varies.Circuits have also been proposed whereby a LOW pedestal power
is monitored successively over time for the laser diode and
incrementally increased or decreased in response to comparison to a
preset dynamic threshold. One such circuit is described by Geller, USP
5,036,189, assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
Though the 
Geller circuit readily establishes and maintains an appropriate LOW
pedestal bias current, it does not control the HIGH power output of the
laser. Referring back to FIG 1, since a slope of the current versus
power output of a laser changes over temperature, for a constant
modulation current IM, the laser extinction ratio (the ratio between the
laser HIGH power divided by the laser LOW power) will change over
time. If the extinction ratio becomes too small, increased noise results
at an optical receiver detecting an output of the laser which results in
undesirable bit errors.It has also been proposed to utilize circuitry which maintains the
average laser modulation power constant over time. Such circuits also
suffer from a disadvantage that the laser output extinction ratio will
change with
