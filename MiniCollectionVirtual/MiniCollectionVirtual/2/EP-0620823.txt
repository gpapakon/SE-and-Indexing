<DESCRIPTION>
6 , 7α-DIFLUOROMETHYLENANDROSTA-l .4-DIEN-3-ONE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATIONThe present invention relates to new 6 , 7α-difluoro- methylenandrosta-1 , 4-dien-3-ones , to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use as therapeutic agents,- in particular in the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases in mammals. Basic and clinical data indicate that aromatized metabolites of androgens, i.e. the estrogens, are the hormones involved in the pathogenic cellular changes associated with the growth of some hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast, endometrial and ovarian carcinomas.Estrogens are aslo involved in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia.Endogenous estrogens are ultimately formed from either androstenedione or testosterone as immediate precursors. The reaction of central importance is the aromatization of the steroidic ring A, which is performed by the enzyme aromatase. As aromatization is a unique reaction and the last in the series of steps in the biosynthesis of estrogens, it has been envisaged that an effective inhibition of the aromatase, resulting from compounds 

able to interact with the aromatizing steps, may have useful application for controlling the amount of circulating estrogens, estrogen-dependent processes in reproduction, and estrogen-dependent tumours. Known steroidal substances which have been reported to be endowed with an aromatase-inhibiting action are, for example, Δ1 -testololactone (U.S.Pat. 2,744,120), 4- hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3 , 17-dione and esters thereof (see, for example, U.S.Pat. 4,235,893), 10- ( 1 , 2-propadienyl )- estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (U.S.Pat. 4,289,762), 10-(2- propynyl )-estr-4-ene-3 , 17-dione ( J .Amer .Chem. Soc . , 103 , 3221 (1981) and U.S.Pat. 4,322,416), 19-thioandrostene derivatives ( Europ.Pat .Appl . 100,566), androsta-4 , 6- diene-3,17-dione, androsta-l,4,6-triene-3,17-dione (G.B.Pat.Appl . 2,100,601A), androsta-1 , 4-diene-3 , 17- dione (Cancer Res. ( Suppl . ) 4_2, 3327 (1982), 6- alkenylen-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-diones (U.S.Pat. 4,808,816 and U.S.Pat. 4,904,650) and 6-alkenylen- androsta-1 , 4-dien-l 7-ol-3-one derivatives (U.S.Pat. 4,873,233) .17α-acetoxy-6, 7α-difluoromethylenandrosta-1,4-dien-3-one is disclosed in US-A-3 , 414 , 592 as an anabolic agent.
