<ABSTRACT>
A power supply is proposed for producing a regulated DC voltage from a mains AC voltage, which power supply has a mains transformer (10), a downstream rectifier arrangement (11) and a semiconductor element (13), connected in a DC voltage line leading away from the rectifier arrangement (11), which can be controlled as a function of a predeterminable nominal value (U2) and the actual value of the output DC voltage (Ua). The semiconductor element (13) is exclusively switched between the saturation and blocking state, a control device (16, 17, 19) which switches on the saturation state if the actual value is less than the nominal value and switches on the blocking state in synchronism with the mains AC voltage or the rectified voltage half-cycles derived therefrom, is allocated to the semiconductor element (13). The output DC voltage is applied to a capacitor (18) connected to the output of the power supply. Since the semiconductor element (13) is exclusively in the saturation or blocking state there is practically no power loss, or at least only an extremely small power loss, so that the power supply can be produced cost-effectively and with a small volume.
