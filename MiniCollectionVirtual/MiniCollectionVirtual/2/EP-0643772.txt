<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) 
variants having extended circulatory half-life as compared to wild-type 
human t-PA while substantially retaining its fibrin binding 
affinity. Certain variants additionally exhibit improved in vivo 
fibrinolytic potency. The invention also concerns methods and means 
for preparing these variants, and pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising them. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a multidomain serine 
protease whose physiological role is to convert plasminogen to 
plasmin, and thus to initiate or accelerate the process of 
fibrinolysis. Initial clinical interest in t-PA was raised because of its 
relatively high activity in the presence, as compared to the absence, 
of fibrin. Wild-type t-PA is a poor enzyme in the absence of fibrin, 
but the presence of fibrin strikingly enhances its ability to activate 
plasminogen. Without stimulation, the catalytic efficiency (catalytic 
rate constant (kcat)/Michaelis constant (Km)) of melanoma or recombinant 
human t-PA (ActivaseÂ® t-PA) for the activation of plasminogen is 
approximately 1 nM-1sec-1, whereas in the presence of fibrin or fibrin 
degradation products, this efficiency (pseudo-rate constant) is 
increased by several hundred-fold. This unusual biochemical property 
of t-PA is thought to translate clinically into a thrombolytic product 
that is less likely than non-fibrin-specific thrombolytics (such as 
streptokinase or urokinase) to induce systemic plasminogen activation 
[Sobel, B.E. et al., Circulation69, 983-990 (1984)]. Recombinant 
human t-PA is used therapeutically as a fibrinolytic agent in the 
treatment of acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, both 
conditions usually resulting from an obstruction of a blood vessel by 
a fibrin-containing thrombus. In addition to its striking fibrin specificity, t-PA exhibits 
several further distinguishing characteristics: 
(a) T-PA differs from most serine proteases in that the single 
chain form of the molecule has appreciable enzymatic activity. Toward 
some small substrates, and toward plasminogen in the absence of 
fibrin, two chain t-PA has greater activity than one chain. In the 
presence of fibrin, however, the two forms of t-PA are equally active 
[Rijken et al., J. Biol. Chem.257, 2920-5 (1982); Lijnen et al., 
Thromb. Haemost.64, 61-8 (1990); Bennett et al., J. Biol. Chem.266,  
 
5191-5201 (1991)] . Most other serine proteases exist as zymogens and 
require proteolytic cleavage to a two-chain form to release full
