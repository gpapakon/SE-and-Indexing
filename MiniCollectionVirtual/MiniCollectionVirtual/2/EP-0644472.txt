<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for prediction of 
performance of a centrifugal pump with a balance mechanism 

comprising the steps of assuming leakage amounts in a back 
of an impeller and a thrust balance mechanism to calculate 

a flow-rate of the impeller for analyzing a leakage amounts 
of a front and a back of the impeller (steps 2, 3, 4 and 

5), calculating a leakage amount in the thrust balance 
mechanism for judging whether or not a result of the 

calculation converges (steps 8 and 9), if the result does 
not converge (step 9), repeating the steps from the 

analysis of the flow in the thrust balance mechanism (step 
7) to the calculation of the leakage amount in the thrust 

balance mechanism (step 8), if the result converges (step 
9), calculating a leakage amount in the pump (step 10), if 

a result of the calculation does not converge (step 11), 
repeating the steps from the calculation of the flow-rate 

in the impeller (step 3) up to the convergence (step 11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for prediction of
performance of a centrifugal pump, and more particularly to
a method for accurate prediction of performance of a
centrifugal pump with a thrust balance mechanism by use of
a quasi-three- dimensional flow analysis.A multistage centrifugal pump with an inducer has widely
been used for transporting some dangerous liquids such as
LPG, LNG, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Since a
reliability and a safety of this pump depends on an axial
thrust balance and a leakage seal, it is essential to use
the axial thrust mechanism for a dip-type pump or a scanned
motor pump and otherwise use a complicated shaft seal gear.Since it is difficult to use the above dangerous liquid for
a performance test of this pump, a substitute liquid is
generally used and an actual pump performance is decided by
use of a performance conversion chart. Generally, the pump
performance indicated by a nondimentional amount is 
identical among all kinds of liquids except for influence
of viscousness thereof.For instance, a formula proposed by Moody, Hutton and
Ackeret has already been widely used as an extended formula
for the influence of the viscosity in a turbine.In Japan, for the turbine, JSME standard S-008 issued on
1989 gives more accurate performance conversions in view of
the theory.In a conventional performance prediction analysis of the
centrifugal pump, various losses being obtainable by the one
dimensional analysis are subtracted from a theoretical pump
head to analyze the performance of an impeller. Further,
in an analysis of a balance mechanism such as inside flow,
it is assumed that a fluid between a rotary wall and a
stilling wall shows a forced vortex motion at a half of a
velocity of the rotary wall to analyze a friction power and
the axial thrust - cf. A/AA/SAE/ASME/ASEE, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, June 24-26, 1991, Sacramento, CA, J. Kurokawa, "Axial Thrust Analysis in Lox-pump".In this kind of the pump, however, there is less available
data to compare a model test with an actual performance.
Thus, it is difficult to evaluate an accuracy of the
performance conversion.The conventional prediction analysis is engaged with
disadvantage as mentioned below. Due to the one 
dimensional analysis, it is difficult to accurately analyze
a flow of the treating liquid inside the impeller. Thus,
there is a large difference between a predictability and an
ability at the observation at non-design point,
particularly in a low flow-rate region, even it is possible
to predict the
