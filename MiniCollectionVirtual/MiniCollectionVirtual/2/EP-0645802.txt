<ABSTRACT>
A TFT formed on an insulating substrate source, drain and channel
regions, a gate insulating film formed on at least the channel region and a

gate electrode formed on the gate insulating film. Between the channel
region and the drain region, a region having a higher resistivity is

provided in order to reduce an Ioff current. A method for forming this
structure comprises the steps of anodizing the gate electrode to form a

porous anodic oxide film on the side of the gate electrode; removing a
portion of the gate insulating using the porous anodic oxide film as a mask

so that the gate insulating film extends beyond the gate electrode but does
not completely cover the source and drain regions. Thereafter, an ion

doping of one conductivity element is performed. The high resistivity
region is defined under the gate insulating film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, in particular, the present invention is directed to an insulated gate field effect transistor of a thin film type formed on an insulating surface which may be a surface of an insulating substrate such as glass or an insulating film such as silicon oxide formed on a silicon wafer. Specifically, the present invention is applicable to the manufacture of a TFT (thin film transistor) formed on a glass substrate of which the glass transition temperature (which is also called distortion point or distortion temperature) is 750Â°C or lower.A semiconductor device manufactured in accordance with the present invention is applicable to a driving circuit for an active matrix device such as a liquid crystal display or an image sensory or a three dimensional integrated circuit.TFTs have been well known to drive an active matrix type liquid crystal device or an image sensor. Specifically, instead of amorphous TFTs having amorphous silicon as the active layer thereof, crystalline Si TFTs have been developed in order to obtain higher field mobility. Figs. 6A-6F are cross sections showing a manufacturing method of a TFT in accordance with the prior art.Referring to Fig. 6A, a base film 602 and an active layer 603 of crystalline silicon are formed on a substrate 601. An insulating film 604 is formed on the active layer using silicon oxide or the like.Then, a gate electrode 605 is formed from phosphorous doped polysilicon, tantalum, titanium, aluminum, etc. With this gate electrode used as a mask, an impurity element (e.g. phosphorous or boron) is doped into the active layer 603 through an appropriate method such as ion-doping in a self-aligning manner, thereby forming impurity regions 606 and 607 containing the impurity at a relatively low concentration and therefore having a relatively high resistivity. These regions 606 and 607 are called high resistivity regions hereinafter. The region of the active layer below the gate electrode which is not doped with the impurity will be a channel region. After that, the doped impurity is activated using laser or a heat source such as a flash lamp. (Fig. 6B)Referring to Fig. 6C, an insulating film 608 of silicon oxide is formed by plasma CVD or APCVD (atmospheric pressure CVD), following which anisotropic etching is performed to leave insulating material 609 adjacent to the side surfaces of the gate electrode as shown in Fig. 6D.Then, using the gate electrode 605 and the insulating material 609
