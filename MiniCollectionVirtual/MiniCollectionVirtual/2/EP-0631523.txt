<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to processes for forming particles which have a core of core material within a shell of polymeric material that has been deposited by coacervation. According to the invention there is provided a dispersion of particles of core material in an aqueous solution of a pH-sensitive polymeric material at a pH at which the polymeric material is soluble. The polymeric material is deposited as a shell around the core material by insolubilisation of the polymeric material caused by adjusting the pH of the solution to a pH at which the polymeric material is insoluble. The adjustment of the pH is conducted at a rate that is sufficiently slow and homogeneous throughout the solution so that the polymeric material deposits substantially only as a substantially uniform coacervate around the individual core particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Coacervation ProcessesThis invention relates to processes for forming particles which have a core of core material within a shell of polymeric material that has been deposited by coacervation.Coacervation processes are well known as a class and involve providing a dispersion of particles (liquid or solid) of core material in an aqueous medium containing coacervating polymer and causing the polymer to phase- separate and deposit around the particles. It is common to promote coacervation by adjusting the conditions in the aqueous medium so as to cause the polymer to deposit. For instance the concentration of a non-solvent may be increased to bring about deposition or two polymers in the medium may be caused to interact to form a polymeric complex as a coacervate.Some polymeric materials are pH-sensitive, i.e., they are soluble'at one pH and insoluble at another pH. It is known to use pH-sensitive polymeric material as a coating or matrix around a pharmaceutically active ingredient to protect that active ingredient from ambient conditions at which the polymeric material is insoluble, and then to release the active ingredient by exposing the polymeric material to pH conditions at which it is soluble. Various techniques are known for depositing the pH-sensitive polymeric material around the active ingredient. Most of them involve forming relatively large particles but coacervation can be used to form small particles if the active ingredient can be supplied initially as a dispersion of small particles.It is known to be desirable to encapsulate certain materials, such as the toxin derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) , within a pH-sensitive polymeric material. Processes for doing this are described in U.S. 4,948,586. These processes involve the use of organic solvents and achievement of encapsulation depends upon the 

choice of appropriate solvents, non-solvents, surfactants and temperature conditions.Coacervation processes of this general type suffer from a number of disadvantages. The use of organic solvents in large quantities is undesirable because it necessitates the provision of suitable solvent handling apparatus and because the solvents themselves can exhibit some phytotoxicity. The changes in concentration or other conditions necessary to cause coacervation are liable to occur rather suddenly (for example at the point of addition of a non-solvent) and it is difficult to obtain uniform coacervation under these conditions.It might be thought that it would be possible to achieve satisfactory

CLAIM8
1. A coacervation process for forming particles having a core of core material within a shell of pH-sensitive polymeric material, the process comprising providing a dispersion of particles of core material in an aqueous solution of the polymeric material at a pH at which the polymeric material is soluble, and depositing the polymeric material as a shell around the core material, characterised in that the polymeric material is deposited as a shell and is insolubilised by adjusting the pH of the solution to a pH at which the polymeric material is insoluble, wherein the adjustment of the pH is conducted at a rate that is sufficiently slow and homogeneous throughout the solution that the polymeric material deposits substantially only as a substantially uniform coacervate around individual particles.
2. A process according to claim 1 wherein the polymeric material changes from a wholly soluble form to an insoluble form over^ *-H change of less than 1 pH unit.
3. A process according to claim 2 wherein the pH change is in the range 0.05 to 0.3 pH units.
4. A process according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein at least 75% by weight of the polymeric material is deposited as a shell, and at. least 75% by weight of core particles are enclosed within a shell of polymeric material.
5. A process according to claim 4 wherein at least 90% by weight of the polymeric material is deposited as a shell around the core material, and at least 90% by weight of. core particles are enclosed within a shell of the polymeric material.
6. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted by dissolving a latent pH-adjusting material in the aqueous solution and causing this material to react in the solution to liberate acid or base throughout the solution, thereby causing an adjustment in pH. 


7. A process according to claim 6 wherein the latent pH- adjusting material comprises a salt of the polymeric material with ammonia or a volatile amine, whereby heating of the solution will drive off the ammonia and convert the polymeric material from a soluble form to an insoluble form.
