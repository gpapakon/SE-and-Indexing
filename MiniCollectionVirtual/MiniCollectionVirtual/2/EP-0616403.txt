<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The free cross-section of wall-mounted ductings of known type is constricted by the installation of earth-leakage circuit-breakers (residual-current-operated circuit-breakers) or miniature circuit-breakers, with the result that it is difficult to lay cable material. 2.2 It is proposed for the U-shaped basic profiles (1') of wall ductings to be sealed by a baseplate (3) which is provided with a mounting rail for the earth-leakage circuit-breakers or miniature circuit-breakers, and for this baseplate (3) to be combined with side walls, end pieces and a covering foil (18) to form a surface-mounting housing (12) which surrounds the circuit-breakers (23). 2.3 Use for wall-mounted ductings in buildings.
