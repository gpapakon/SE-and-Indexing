<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel use of Amadori
rearrangement compounds and of products having at least partly
entered an Amadori rearrangement as per the following reaction
scheme, to the production thereof as well as to specific
mixtures of such compounds and to pharmaceutical and cosmetic
compositions containing these mixturesproducts:

Amadori rearrangement compounds are known; they are reaction
products, for example, of an amino acid or a peptide with a
sugar, oligo- or polysaccharide having entered an Amadori
rearrangement (Henri Borsook et al.,J. Biol. Soc. 215
(1955),111-124, ). Thus, in DE-C-3914354, a water-soluble
glycoprotein of an amino acid and a sugar is described which is
isolated from an extract of Avena sativa seeds. Further, EP-A-406087
describes water-soluble polysaccharide-glycopeptide
complexes which are derived from the cell wall of Gram positive
bacterium, and J. Biol. Chem. 1985, 260/9 states that NMR-spectroscopy
has been used to characterize Amadori rearrangement
compounds formed by reaction of glucose with free amino groups
of protein. EP-A-152 856 reports the chemical synthesis of biologically
active N-acylated 1-alkylamino-1-deoxy-ketose analogues wherein
the final products are obtained by reacting a sugar with an
alkylamino compound and carrying out an Amadori rearrangement to
yield a 1-alkylamino-1-deoxy-ketose analogue, followed by a
final acylation of the amino group. The process requires at
least a three step procedure for subsequently carrying out the
necessary chemical reactions as well as the input of more or
less expensive chemical reagents involved in the process, in
addition to the basic reactants.WO 89/09786 teaches amongst others a LHRH antagonist peptide
and a calcitonin peptide modified by at least one Amadori
rearranged sugar residue. The resulting products are useful for
inhibiting luteinizing hormone secretion and calcium regulation
in the body, respectively. It also discloses various processes
for the manufacture of these products, e.g. using as the solvent
a mixture of DMF/AcOH and carrying out the reaction at 55°C for
4 hours.EP 111 211 teaches amongst others the production of immunogenic
agents to induce the release of antibodies for the specific
detection of compounds containing Amadori rearranged sugars in
the blood of patients. The immunogenic agent can be a natural
protein or polypeptide or a synthetically prepared macromolecule
carrying 1-deoxy-fructosyl residues. The peptides have molecular
weights of between 4,000 and 10,000,000 daltons.
