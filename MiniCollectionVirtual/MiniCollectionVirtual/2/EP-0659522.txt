<ABSTRACT>
A random orbit sander having a braking member 48 for 
frictionally controlling the speed of a platen 18 of the 

sander when the sander is removed from a workpiece during 
operation. The braking member includes a base portion 54, 

an outwardly flaring, relatively thin wall portion 60 and an 
enlarged outermost edge portion 62 adapted to frictionally 

engage an upper surface 52 of the platen. The braking 
member is secured to the bottom of the shroud 14 of the 

housing 12 via a groove 58 formed in its base portion. The 
braking member exerts a relatively constant spring force 

against the upper surface of the platen which limits the 
rotational speed of the platen to approximately 1200 rpm 

when the platen is lifted off of a work surface, without 
significantly degrading the performance of the sander under 

load. This prevents swirl marks and other undesirable 
scratches from being made in a workpiece when the platen is 

reapplied to the workpiece as a result of the platen having 
increased in speed to an unloaded, free-wheeling speed, and 

yet allows the platen to operate at or above the minimum 
desired working speed of about 800 rpm. The braking member 

is formed from polyester butylene terephthalate which is 
doped with approximately 2% silicon and approximately 15% 

teflon in the preferred embodiments. This material 
formulation, plus its geometry, allows the braking member to 

exert and maintain a relatively constant spring force of 
about 3.5 lbs. against the platen and to resist frictional 

wear once past an initial break-in period. The braking 
member also acts as a seal between the lower surface 50 of 

the shroud 14 and the upper surface 52 of the platen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to random orbital sanders, and
more particularly to a random orbital sander having an
annular member which acts as a brake on a platen of the
sander to control the speed of the platen when the platen is
lifted off of a work surface during operation of the sander.Random orbital sanders are used in a variety of
applications where it is desirable to obtain an extremely
smooth surface free of scratches and swirl marks. Such
applications typically involve wood working applications
such as furniture construction or vehicle body repair
applications, just to name a few. In either of these
applications it is imperative that the work surface be free
of scratches and/or swirl marks before the surface is
painted or otherwise coated with some form of finish sealer
or stain.Prior developed random orbital sanders typically
include a platen which is driven rotationally by a
motor-driven spindle within the sander. The platen is
driven via a freely rotatable bearing that is eccentrically
mounted on the end of the drive spindle. Rotation of the
drive spindle causes the platen to orbit about the drive
spindle while frictional forces within the bearing, as well
as varying frictional loads on the sanding disc attached to
the platen, cause the platen to also rotate about the
eccentric bearing, thereby imparting the "random" orbital
movement to the platen.Typically such random orbit sanders also include a fan
member which is driven by the output shaft of the motor.
The fan member is adapted to draw dust and debris generated
by the sanding action up through openings formed in the 
platen and into a filter or other like dust collecting
receptacle. However, since at least some small degree of
clearance must be left between the bottom housing or shroud
of the sander and the upper surface of the platen to provide
unimpeded rotational movement of the platen relative to the
housing, this reduces the suction force that can be
generated through the openings in the platen. Consequently,
the ability of the fan to draw dust directly off of the work
surface and through the openings in the platen is reduced.However, a problem with most prior random orbit sanders
is that the operator must be extremely careful not to gouge
or mar the surface of the workpiece when the sander is
applied to the workpiece. In particular, because the
rotational speed of the platen varies with loading, when the
platen is lifted off of the work surface the platen tends to
spin up to an unloaded or "free wheeling" speed
approximately equal to

<CLAIMS>
A random orbit sander comprising:

a housing (12);
a drive unit having a motor (30) and an output
shaft (34),
a bearing (42) mounted on the output shaft (34)
and located radially eccentrically relative to the

output shaft (34);
an arbor (36c) mounted on the eccentric bearing
(42)
a platen (18) driven rotationally by said arbor
spaced axially apart from a lower surface (50) of the

housing (12); and
brake means (48) comprising a flexible annular
seal (48) that is secured to the lower surface (50) and

is frictionally engaged to an upper surface (52) of
said platen (18) for controllably, frictionally braking

said platen to control the rotational speed of said
platen by limiting its rotational speed to a maximum

predetermined operating speed when said platen is
lifted off of a work surface during operation of said

sander, and for sealing the axial gap between the lower
surface of the housing and said platen

   and including (a) a base portion (54) secured to
said housing, (b) a flexible, flaring wall portion (60)

is formed from polyester butylene terephthalate doped with

silicon and Teflon (Registered Trade Mark).
