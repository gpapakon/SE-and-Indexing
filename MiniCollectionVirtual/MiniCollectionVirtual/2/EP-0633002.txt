<ABSTRACT>
The forceps has a handle (1) and a forceps insert which can be inserted in the handle and comprises a shaft (3) with a jaw (4) arranged on the distal end thereof. A rod (6) is guided in the shaft (3) for opening and closing the jaw (4). The rod (6) is releasably locked with the shaft (3) and secured against axial movements. The rod (6) and the shaft (3), i.e. the forceps insert, are releasably and rotatably connected to the handle (1). At its proximal end, the rod (6) is designed as a coupling part (17, 18) which is releasably connected to the handle (1). The forceps described can be easily dismantled without the aid of any tools, in particular, for the purpose of effective cleaning and disinfection, so that the handle (1) can also be equipped with different forceps inserts.
