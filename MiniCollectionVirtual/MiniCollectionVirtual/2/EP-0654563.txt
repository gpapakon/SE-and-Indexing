<ABSTRACT>
Post (1) and means to anchor it in the ground, for example 
to prevent the parking of vehicles, resilient means (19) 

being present between the anchoring means and the post (1) 
so that the post can tilt a little when a horizontal force 

is applied thereon, such as by a colliding vehicle. The 
post (1) is hollow and contains a coil spring (19) the 

upper end of which is anchored to the post and the lower 
end to a horizontal plate (12) with a standing rim (15) 

that has been fittingly inserted in the lower end of the 
post.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a post and means to anchor it in
the ground, for example to prevent the parking of vehicles,
resilient means being present between the anchoring means
and the post so that from the vertical position the post
can bring about a certain angular displacement when a force
in approximately horizontal direction is applied thereon,
such as by a vehicle colliding with it, and the post will
return from this position to its vertical position once the
force on the post has been removed.Such a post is known from NL-A-9102035. This known post is
made of concrete and a reinforcement bar accommodated
therein has at its lower end been connected to a cable.
Said cable runs downward through a passage into a
foundation block and has at its lower end been connected to
a threaded end onto which a nut has been screwed. A strip,
which is accommodated in a cavity of the block, rests upon
the nut.Between the strip and the upper wall of the cavity,
resilient means are located such as those in the shape of a
rubber sleeve which is compressed between the upper wall
and the strip. By turning the nut the elastic sleeve can be
brought on the pre-stress desired.Such a construction is elaborate and heavy, as a result of
which its manufacture and installation will be relatively
expensive. As the resilient means are continually under
strain, the resilient force produced by them will decrease
in time. Readjustment of the desired strain can only be
effected by excavating the entire foundation block. The
resilient means being located in the ground, it will be
subject to ageing.Furthermore, when a vehicle collides with the post, not
only will a tilting motion be applied to the post, it will 
also be subject to a force in horizontal direction. As a
result the cable may be urged against the upper edge of the
passage in the foundation block and may be damaged and even
break.The invention now aims at removing said disadvantages and
provides to this end that the post has been made hollow and
that within the post a coil spring has been placed the
upper end of which is anchored to the post and the lower
end to a virtually horizontally oriented plate that is part
of the anchoring means, and which plate has been provided
with a standing rim which has been fittingly inserted in
the lower end of the post.The post may be constructed of metal as well as plastic
material and can be considerably lighter than a post made
of concrete, nonetheless possessing sufficient strength.

<CLAIMS>
Post (1) and means (2) to anchor it in the ground, for
example to prevent the parking of vehicles, resilient means

(19) being present between the anchoring means and the post
(1) so that from the vertical position the post can bring

about a certain angular displacement when a force in
approximately horizontal direction is applied thereon, such

as by a vehicle colliding with it, and the post will return
from this position to its vertical position once the force

on the post has been removed, 
characterized in that
 the
post (1) has been made hollow and that within the post a

coil spring (19) has been placed the upper end of which is
anchored to the post and the lower end to a virtually

horizontally oriented plate (12) that is part of the
anchoring means (2), and which plate (12) has been provided

with a standing rim (15) which has been fittingly inserted
in the lower end of the post.
Post as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 use is
made of a coil spring (19) the windings of which are

accommodated close together and which allows for the
windings still being adjoined in the mounted position of

the post (1).
Post as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
characterized in that

the connection between the upper end of the spring (19) and
the post (1) is achieved by a pin (20) transversely brought

into the post (1), which has been grasped by an eye-part of
the coil spring and which pin (20) has an approximate V-shape

such that the spring will be drawn toward the centre
of the V.
Post as claimed in any of the preceding claims

characterized in that
, the anchoring means (2) contains a
tube (3), a rod (4) attached to the outside thereof and

winded in a spring-coil shape, some windings of which
continue below the lower end of the tube (3), a receiving

part (5) mounted at the upper end of the tube for the 

sliding but not rotating accomodating of a clamping piece
(6) that with its upper end can be drawn against the plate

(12) by means of a bolt (11) and therewith is wedged in the
receiving part (5).
Post as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
upper end of the tube (3) is provided with a rectangular or

square part (5) which can be grasped by a tool.
Post as claimed in any of the claims 4 - 6,

characterized in that
 the rectangular part is obtained in
that the receiving part (5) connected to the tube (3) is

formed by a square tube the upper end of which projects
above the tube (3).
Post as claimed in any of the claims 4 - 6,

characterized in that
 the clamping piece (6) may be formed
by: a sleeve (7) slidable in the receiving part (5), the

upper end of which may adjoin the plate (12) and the lower
end (8) has obliquely been cut off; a slidable but not

rotatable threaded element (9) accommodated in the
receiving part (5) which has been obliquely cut off at its

upper end (10) in order to adjoin the slanting lower part
(8) of the sleeve (7) and which threaded element has been

provided with a thread; and a bolt (11) to be screwed into
the threaded element (9), which extends upwards through the

sleeve (7) with ample clearance and which bolt (11) rests
with its head on the plate (12).
Post as claimed in any of the claims 1 - 3,

characterized in that
 the plate (12) that is part of the
anchoring means (2) is connected to a downward extended

tube or bar (22), which in its turn is connected to a
partition (23) roughly parallel to the plate.
