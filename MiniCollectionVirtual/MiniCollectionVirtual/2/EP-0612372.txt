<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for the removal of electrically conducting particles from a stream of gas, the method calling for the gas stream to be passed through a filter (20), thus separating the particles out from the gas. The particle-contaminated filter (20) is subsequently regenerated in situ by subjecting the particles (26) to a spark discharge and/or short arc discharge for a length of time such that the particles ignite and are thus converted by combustion into gaseous compounds. The device designed to carry out the method has a filter (20) through or past which the gas stream flows, at least two electrodes (2, 3, 4) associated with the filter plus at least one counter-electrode (5, 6) designed to generate the spark and/or arc discharge, that at least two electrodes (2, 3, 4) and the at least one counter-electrode (5, 6) being connected to a suitable power source.
