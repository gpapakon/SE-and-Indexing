<ABSTRACT>
A known brake has the disadvantage that due to long brake levers the force acting on the bearing pins of the brake levers can lead to the base of the bearing pin being bent. In the case of the novel rim brake the intention is to improve the ratio of hand force exerted to braking force released. A cable sheath (1) with the brake cable (2) is guided, in the region of the free end of the brake lever (3, 4), from one side up to the first brake lever (3). The cable sheath (1) is supported on the first brake lever (3). The brake cable (2) runs on further to the second brake lever (4) and is secured there. The brake cable (2) runs axially through the single restoring spring (5) arranged between the two brake levers (3, 4). Fitted on each of the bearing pins (11, 12) for the brake levers (3, 4) is a respective, adjustable centring disc (13, 14), which has a respective circular-segment-shaped stop groove (15, 16) and is mounted in a manner such that it can be screwed fixedly to bearing pins (11, 12) fixed on the fork. Each brake lever (3, 4) has a centring pin (17, 18) which strikes against the end of the stop groove (15, 16) in the rest condition of the rim brake (100) when the brake pads (8, 9) have been released from the wheel rim (210). It is advantageous that only one restoring spring is necessary between the brake levers.
