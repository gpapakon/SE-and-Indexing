<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for flexibly encasing electronic circuitry, where an electronic circuit (1) is enclosed in a casing which comprises a laminate (2) consisting of metal and plastic sheets such as to form a diffusion impervious and electrically conductive structure which prevents harmful substances from reaching the electronic circuit (1) and also prevents inductive electromagnetic exchange. Electrical conductors (3) pass through the joint region (4) of the laminate (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for encapsulating 
electronic components or circuitry such as to protect the electric 
circuit against substances which may act deleteriously thereon, 
wherein the device also attenuates radiofrequency electromagnetic 
radiation so as to protect the circuit against such radiation that 
can enter from the surroundings and disturb the function of the 
circuit through induction, said device also being active to 
protect the surroundings when the circuit concerned constitutes 
a disturbance or interference source. The device includes 
throughlet conductors which allow circuit-functional current and 
signals to be applied when required. It is often necessary to protect electronic circuits against 
different influences emanating from the surroundings. Factors 
which influence electronic circuitry include water and other 
corrosive and electrically conductive materials. It is also often 
important to protect the circuitry against electromagnetic 
radiation. In this regard, there is traditionally used different 
types of capsules which can be roughly divided into two main 
groups, hermetic capsules and plastic capsules. In the case of 
hermetic capsules, the electronic circuitry is surrounded by a 
clean and dry volume of gas enclosed in a diffusion-impervious 
casing, normally a metal, glass or ceramic casing. When the casing 
is made of metal, glass throughlets are fused in the metal casing 
for leading electrical conductors between the encapsulated 
circuitry and the ambient surroundings. When a plastic capsule is 
used, the circuitry is surrounded by plastic material instead of 
clean or pure gas. Although the plastic material is permeable to 
water and gases, it will nevertheless often provide satisfactory 
protection, because coherent films are unable to form on the 
surfaces of the circuit components. Furthermore, plastic material 
has a more or less pronounced ability to bind chemically with the  
 
polar groups present in the surface of the circuit components. 
These groups are thus blocked so as to be unable to form corrosion 
attack sites. The differences in the coefficient of thermal 
expansion between the different materials present constitutes a 
problem in both types of capsule. Another problem is that the 
circuitry is often so sensitive as to react against compounds 
which are split or cleaved from the actual encapsulating materials. 
A third problem is that polymeric material is often unable 
to withstand the working temperatures concerned,
