<ABSTRACT>
The tackiness associated with certain soft acrylic polymers can be reduced by plasma treatment of the polymer surface. This is particularly useful with regard to intraocular lenses (IOLs), especially foldable IOLs, which are made from such soft acrylic polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for reducing the tackiness of
certain soft acrylic polymers. The present invention is particularly useful in relation
to ophthalmic lenses made of such soft acrylic polymers, especially foldable
intraocular lenses.Intraocular lenses have been known since about 1950. They are used to
replace the natural lenses of eyes which have been damaged by trauma or
disease, such as cataracts. A typical intraocular lens (IOL) comprises an artificial
lens ("optic") and at least one support member ("haptic") for positioning the IOL in
the eye. The optic may be formed from any of a number of different materials,
including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and it may be hard, relatively flexible or
even fully deformable in order to permit the IOL to be rolled or folded and inserted
through a relatively small incision in the eye. The haptic is generally made of some
resilient material, such as polypropylene or PMMA. The IOLs can have either a
"one-piece" or a "multi-piece" design. A multipiece lens is so called because the
optic and the haptic(s) are made separately and then the haptics are attached to
the optic. In a one-piece lens, the optic and haptic(s) are formed out of one piece
of material, and depending on the material, the haptics are then cut, or lathed, out
of the material to produce the IOL.European Patent Publication No. 485 197 A1 (published 13 May 1992)
discloses a class of soft acrylic polymers which are suitable for forming IOLs which
have high refractive index, are flexible and transparent, can be inserted into the
eye through a relatively small incision and recover their original shape after
insertion. Although this type of lens material is advantageous in that thinner lenses
may be crafted, which allow the IOLs to be folded and permit the use of smaller 
incisions, it has been found that this type of lens material has a tendency to adhere
to itself, as well as to the handling tools. In fact, the inserted IOL can take several
minutes to release from itself following insertion. A tacky lens requires more
manipulations by the surgeon and increases surgery time (because of the
manipulations and lengthy unfolding time). The reduced surface tack lens can be
more easily manipulated during surgical implantation. The final outcome with a
reduced surface tack lens is easier IOL placement, reduced surgery time, and
greater safety for the patient.Both chemically non-reactive and chemically reactive plasmas have been
used to treat various polymer surfaces for several years.
