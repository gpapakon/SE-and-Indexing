<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking an animal comprises a 
robot arm arrangement (5, 6) with a robot arm (6) able to 

carry teat cups (45 to 48), sensor means (51) to determine 
the position of the teats and control means (18, 22, 26, 36, 

40, 80 to 83) to convey the robot arm (6) under the udder 
such that the teat cups (45 to 48) can be connected to the 

teats. The control means (18, 22, 26, 36, 40, 80 to 83) 
comprise a closed control loop (80 to 83) and operating 

cylinders (18, 22, 36, 40) controlled by said control loop 
(80 to 83). A microprocessor is provided to which the momentaneous 

teat position obtained by the sensor means (51) and 
the actual position of the cylinders (18, 22, 36, 40) from 

cylinder control electronics are supplied. Thereupon the 
microprocessor determines control signals which are supplied 

to said cylinder control electronics (81). The latter unit 
controls in response thereto the cylinders (18, 22, 36, 40) 

and supplies the updated actual position of the cylinders 
(18, 22, 36, 40) to the microprocessor (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement for
milking an animal, such as a cow, as defined in the preamble of Claim 1.Such an implement is known from EP-A-0 323 875, in
which a control loop is used for finding and thereafter
tracking the position of each teat of a cow. The control loop
is open in a first (finding) mode and can be closed later in
a second mode, provided that certain criteria are satisfied.
If certain further criteria are satisfied, a teat cup can be
connected in a third mode. The invention aims to provide a
less complicated and faster implement. In order to convey the
robot arm fast and accurately under the animal's udder so
that the teat cups can be connected to the teats of the
animal by an upward movement, according to the invention the
implement is characterized by the features of the characterizing
part of claim 1. Preferably to the microprocessor the
momentaneous teat position obtained with the aid of the
sensor means and the actual position of the operating cylinders
from the cylinder control electronics are supplied,
while in the microprocessor, based on the supplied data,
control signals for the operating cylinders are determined,
which control signals are supplied to the cylinder control
electronics which in response to said control signals control
the operating cylinders and supply the updated actual position
of the operating cylinders to the microprocessor.In the time during which the teat cups must be
connected to the teats, the connecting operation may be
hampered by movements of the animal in the milking parlour. 
The teat position as obtained with the aid of the sensor
means will continuously vary, which has as a consequence that
in the microprocessor successive calculations for controlling
the operating cylinders are performed, which can differ to a
relatively large extent. Therefore, preferably,
the control signals for controlling the movements of
the teat cups in a horizontal plane are determined relative
to a floating reference point. Particularly, this floating
reference point may be a point on the animal's rear centre. Such
a floating point is the reason for a robot arm arrangement
following the movements of the animal; the animal may be in
rest in the co-moving measuring system of the robot arm
arrangement. In order to realise such a co-moving measuring
system, the implement may be pre
provided with a sensor device, which determines the reference
point. Preferably, the sensor device is kept in a fixed
relationship with respect to the animal by means of an
operat

An implement for milking an animal, such as a cow,
comprising a milking parlour, a robot arm arrangement (5, 6)

with a robot arm (6) able to carry teat cups (45 to 48),

position of the teats of the animal relative to the robot arm

control loop (80 to 83) for determining in a searching
procedure the position of the teats relative to a reference
