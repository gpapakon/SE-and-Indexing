<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated abrasive backings. More
specifically, the present invention relates to coated abrasive backings with a
backing material containing a thermoplastic resin and a fibrous reinforcing
material. Further, the invention relates to a method of
making a coated abrasive article.Coated abrasive articles generally contain an abrasive material, typically
in the form of abrasive grains, bonded to a backing by means of one or more
adhesive layers. Such articles usually take the form of sheets, discs, belts,
bands, and the like.Many abrasive articles are used as discs, in grinding assemblies. A
typical such abrasive sanding or grinding assembly includes: a back-up pad or
support pad made from a resilient and reinforced material such as rubber or
plastic; an abrasive disc, which is typically frictionally mounted on the back-up
pad; and a rotatable shaft and cap for mounting the abrasive disc and back-up
pad by pressure applied to the disc upon screwing the cap into the shaft so that
the disc is squeezed against the back-up pad. In use, the shaft of the assembly
exemplified is rotated and the abrasive coated surface of the disc is pressed
against a workpiece with considerable force. Thus, the disc is subjected to
severe stresses. This is also true for abrasive articles in other forms, such as
belts.The backings used in coated abrasive articles are typically made of
paper, polymeric materials, cloth, nonwoven materials, vulcanized fiber, or
combinations of these materials. Many of these materials are not appropriate
for certain applications because they are not of sufficient strength, flexibility, or
impact resistance. Some of these materials age unacceptably rapidly. In some
instances the materials are sensitive to liquids which are used as coolants and
cutting fluids. As a result, early failure and poor functioning can occur in
certain applications.A common material used for coated abrasive backing material is
vulcanized fiber. Vulcanized fiber backings are typically heat resistant and
strong, which are advantageous characteristics when the coated abrasive is used
in a grinding operation that imposes severe conditions of heat and pressure.
For example, vulcanized fiber is used in certain grinding operations, such as 
weld grinding, contour grinding, and edge grinding, wherein the coated
abrasive can be exposed to temperatures greater than 140°C. Vulcanized fiber
backings, however, are expensive, hygroscopic, and thus sensitive to humidity.Under extreme conditions of humidity, i.e.,

<CLAIMS>
A coated abrasive backing including

(a) a tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder material which
is present in an amount of 60-99 wt-%, based upon the weight of the backing; and
(b) from 1 to 40 wt-% of a fibrous reinforcing material
having an aspect ratio of at least about 100:1 imparting stiffness, shape control, and

heat resistance to said backing is distributed
throughout the tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder

material; wherein the tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder
material and fibrous reinforcing material together comprise a

hardened composition that will not substantially deform or
disintegrate under abrading conditions.
The coated abrasive backing of claim 1 further characterized by the
features that:


(a) the tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder material has a
melting point of at least 200°C; and
(b) the fibrous reinforcing material is in the form of individual fibers
with a melting point at least 25°C above the melting point of the

tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder material.
The coated abrasive backing of claim 1 further including a molded-in
attachment system.
The coated abrasive backing of claim 3 wherein the backing is in the
shape of a disc and the attachment system is located in the center of the

disc.
A coated abrasive article characterized by including the backing of any
one of the preceding claims and further characterized in that:


(a) a first adhesive layer is applied to the working surface of the
backing;
(b) an abrasive material is embedded into the first adhesive layer;
and 
(c) a second adhesive layer is applied to the abrasive material and
first adhesive layer.
The coated abrasive article of claim 5 further characterized in that the
back surface of the backing has ribs molded therein, the ribs being

molded into the back surface of the backing in a radial pattern.
The coated abrasive article of claim 5 further characterized in that the
backing has an edge region and a center region; said edge region being

of increased thickness relative to said center region.
A method of making the coated abrasive article of any one of claims 5, 6 and
7, comprising the steps of


(a) combining a tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder material
and an effective amount of a fibrous reinforcing material

having an aspect ratio of at least about 100:1 such
that the fibrous reinforcing material is distributed throughout the

tough, heat resistant, thermoplastic binder, to form a softened,
moldable, mixture;
(b) forming a shaped object out of the softened, moldable, mixture;
(c) cooling the shaped object to form a hardened backing for a
coated abrasive article; the hardened backing being capable of

withstanding conditions during use such that the hardened
backing will not substantially deform or disintegrate;
(d) applying a layer of an adhesive to the hardened backing; and
(e) applying a layer of abrasive material to the hardened backing
coated with a layer of adhesive.
The method of claim 8 further including adding
a toughening agent to the thermoplastic binder material

ad the fibrous reinforcing material prior to the step of
forming a shaped object.
The method of claim 8 wherein the
thermoplastic binder material and the fibrous

reinforcing material are compounded together in an
extruder, pellitized, and fed into a injection molding

machine.
The method of claim 9 wherein the
thermoplastic binder material, the fibrous reinforcing

material, and the toughening agent are compounded
together in an extruder, pellitized, and fed into an

injection molding machine.
