Process for the rapid synthesis of support-bound or free peptides, starting from one
or more functionalized supports and synthesizing the required peptides step by step

corresponding to the given amino acid sequences according to a suitable synthesis
procedure, 
characterized
 in that

several to very many different peptides are synthesized simultaneously alongside
each other on a flat material on spot-shaped or linear reaction areas which are not

in contact with each other,
using flat material as the support,
at each synthesis step, for the coupling, transferring small aliquots, in the shape of
spots or lines, of solutions of the required amino acids or of the required di- or oligopeptides,

in the form of their activated derivatives, to the planar support,
carrying out the coupling reactions in the reaction areas, which develop by wetting,
and,
where appropriate, separating the completed peptides from the planar support
using a suitable cleaving solution.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the flat material employed is a
porous or non-porous film, membrane, or a paper of this nature, which possesses a

chemically reactive functionality which is suitable for coupling amino acids or
peptides.
Process according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the flat material is composed of
cellulose, glass or organic polymers and its surface possesses a suitable chemical

functionality. 
Process according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that the functionalization of the
surfaces takes place by the introduction of aminopropyl groups or glycine or

diglycine anchor groups.
Process according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
 in that the peptides being
synthesized are constructed (a) linked directly by their C-terminus to the flat material

or (b) linked to the flat material via a linker.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the
surface-specific loading with reactive functionalities is from 1 pmol to 1 pmol

per cm
2
.
Process for the rapid synthesis of support-bound or free oligonucleotides, starting
from one or more functionalized supports and synthesizing the required

oligonucleotides step by step corresponding to the given nucleotide sequences
according to a suitable synthesis procedure, 
characterized
 in that

several to very many different oligonucleotides are synthesized simultaneously
alongside each other on a flat material on spot-shaped or linear reaction areas

which are not in contact with each other,
using flat material as the support,
at each synthesis step, for the coupling, transferring small aliquots, in the shape of
spots or lines, of solutions of the required nucleotides or of the required di- or oligonucleotides,

in the form of their activated derivatives, to the planar support,
carrying out the coupling reaction in the reaction areas, which develop by wetting,
and,
where appropriate, separating the completed oligonucleotides from the planar
support using a suitable cleaving solution.
Process according to claim 7, 
characterized
 in that the flat material employed is a
porous or non-porous film, membrane, or a paper of this nature, which possesses a

chemically reactive functionality which is suitable for coupling nucleotides.
Process according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized
 in that the measures of claim 3, 4
or 6 are used.
Process according to claim 9, 
characterized
 in that the oligonucleotides being
synthesized are constructed (a) linked directly by their 3'-terminus to the flat material

or (b) linked to the flat material via a linker.
Flat material with peptides bound to it, prepared according to one of claims 1 to 6.
Flat material with oligonucleotides bound to it, prepared according to one of claims 7
to 10.
Use of the flat material according to claim 11 for microbiological and, in particular,
diagnostic purposes in human and veterinary medicine for the specific detection of

bacterial and viral infections.
Use of the flat material according to claim 12 for hybridization purposes.
