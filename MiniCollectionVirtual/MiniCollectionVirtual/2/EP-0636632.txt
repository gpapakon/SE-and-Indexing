<ABSTRACT>
Novel non-reducing oligosaccharide having a structure 
represented by the formula of alpha-D-oligoglucosyl alpha-D-oligoglucoside 

is obtained by exposing either an aqueous 
solution which contains trehalose and an alpha-glucosyl saccharide 

or an aqueous solution which contains a non-reducing 
saccharide bearing a trehalose structure at its end to a 

saccharide-transferring enzyme. The oligosaccharide has a 
reduced sweetness, superior stability, appropriate viscosity 

and less or no susceptibility to crystallization or superior 
solubility when in crystalline form. These features make the 

oligosaccharide very useful in various compositions including 
foods, beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and shaped bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel saccharide and its 
production and use, in particular, to a non-reducing oligo-saccharide 
represented by the general formula of alpha-D-oligo-glucosyl 
alpha-D-oligoglucoside, as well as to its production 
and use. There have been known several distinct types of 
non-reducing oligosaccharides: a type where as found in 
sucrose, erlose, raffinose, melezitose and kestose, glucose and 
fructose are bound via the alpha-1 and beta-2 linkages, in 
other words, oligosaccharides having a sucrose structure in the 
molecules; sugar alcohols such as maltitol, maltotriitol and 
lactitol; and trehalose where glucoses are bound each other via 
the alpha-1 and alpha-1 linkages. Oligosaccharides which bear 
a sucrose structure in the molecules are however readily decomposable 
in acidic solutions because the sucrose structure is 
labile. These do restrict the processing of foods, beverages 
and the like. Sugar alcohols, which are usually prepared by 
hydrogenation at elevated pressure, have a superior stability, 
as well as having the demerit that when excessively intaken 
they may induce diarrhea because they are less digestable and  
 
assimilable in human body. While trehalose is very stable and 
the present inventors found that it is readily digested and 
assimilated into energy in human body. Also was found that 
trehalose is however low in molecular weight, inferior in 
viscosity, too high in crystallizability therefore when used in 
concentrated aqueous solution form, crystals educe during the 
storage and these restrict uses in food industry. Thus there 
have been a strong demand for the development of higher non-reducing 
oligosaccharides which are superior in stability, 
digestibility and assimilability, as well as having an appropriate 
viscosity, less or no susceptibility to crystallization 
or superior solubility when in crystalline form. This invention aims to provide a novel non-reducing 
oligosaccharide bearing a trehalose structure in the molecule 
and also having either less or no susceptibility to crystallization 
or superior solubility when in crystalline form, as 
well as to provide its production and use. To establish such a non-reducing oligosaccharide and 
its production, the present inventors studied various means 
which can bind additional saccharides to both glucosyl groups  
 
present in trehalose molecule. This study eventually led to 
the finding that the objectives are attainable by exposing 
either an aqueous solution which contains trehalose and an 
alp
