<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a nut with a pressure ring, the pressure ring being provided with a dome-like underside for engagement into a complementary hollow in a component which is to be fastened. In order to permit simple and secure mounting of the nut with the pressure ring and to ensure clearly reproducible tightening forces, the pressure ring (12) is designed as a closed ring and provision is made for means (18, 19), e.g. a beaded border and a circumferential flange, for captive connection of the nut (10) to the pressure ring (12), it being possible for these to be rotated relative to one another about the nut axis (1) and to be displaced transversely to the nut axis (1). For the connection of nut (10) and pressure ring (12), the beaded border (18) is arranged on the first (10) of these two elements, such that it engages with radial and axial play over the circumferential flange (19) provided on the second element (12).

A nut with a thrust collar, the thrust collar (42, 52) being provided with a part-spherical
underside for engagement in a matching recess in a component for

fixing and the thrust collar (42, 52) being a closed ring and means (41, 51)
being provided for captive connection of the nut (40, 50) to the thrust collar

(42, 52) in such a manner that they are rotatable about the nut axis (1)
relatively to one another and displaceable transversely of the nut axis (1),


characterized
 in that the means for connecting the nut (40, 50) and the
thrust collar (42, 52) are formed by a clamp ring (41, 51) which respectively

engages over a peripheral flange (47, 49; 57, 59) formed on each of the two
elements (40, 42; 50, 52).
A nut with a thrust collar according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
clamp ring (41) respectively is centred so as to be free from play on one (40)

of the two elements (40, 42) and surrounds the other element (42) with
lateral clearance.
A nut with a thrust collar according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the
clamp ring (41) consists of spring steel.
A nut with a thrust collar according to any one of the claims 1 to 3,

characterized
 in that the thrust transmission surface (13) being provided
with lubricant pockets is shot-blasted and that the other thrust transmission

surface (11) is precision turned, respectively.
A nut with a thrust collar according to any one of the claims 1 to 4,

characterized
 in that the thrust collar (12) has an inside diameter (d
1
) which
is larger by a predetermined tolerance than the screwthreaded inside

diameter (d
2
) of the nut (10).
A nut with a thrust collar according to any one of the claims 1 to 5,

characterized
 in that the thrust transmission surfaces (11, 13) of the two
elements (10, 12) are aligned at right angles to the nut axis (1). 
A nut with a thrust collar according to any one of the claims 1 to 6,

characterized
 in that at least one (13) of the facing thrust transmission
surfaces of the nut (10) and of the thrust collar (12) is patterned, i.e. it can

be provided with lubricant.
A nut with a thrust collar according to any one of the foregoing claims 1 to 7,

characterized
 in that the part-spherical underside (14) of the thrust collar
(12) has a sphere centre situated on the screw nut axis (1).
