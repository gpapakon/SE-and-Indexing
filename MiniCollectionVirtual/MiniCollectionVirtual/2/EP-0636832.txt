<ABSTRACT>
Safety cap (10), especially suitable for tanks of steam producing 
appliances, provided with a bush (18) with longitudinal grooves 

(24), a through-hole (20) housing a sphere (28) obtained along 
the inner body (12) being aligned with said grooves. Within said 

body, a mobile piston (16) is contained which has a peripheral 
groove (36). In the absence of pressure, the spheres (28) drag 

the bush (18) towards the inside of the cap (10); while in the 
presence of pressure, the piston (16) moves forwards and the 

spheres (28) go down in the groove (26). Lacking the dragging, 
the cap (10) cannot be unscrewed. A safety valve, made up by a 

ring (44) and a gasket (46) steps in automatically in the 
presence of excess pressure, exhausting the flow from an end hole 

(22). Piston (16) and said valve are kept under tension by 
suitably calibrated springs (34) and (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a safety cap especially suitable for 
tanks of steam producing appliances. More particularly, this invention relates to a cap as specified 
above, incorporating a device suitable to prevent the opening of 
the tank in the presence of a given steam pressure existing 
inside it. A safety cap for application to a tank of a steam producing appliance is known from EP-A-0 400514. Said disclosed safety cap has the features of the preamble of claim 1. Several appliances are known to the art that are equipped with a 
small boiler for the formation of steam; the airlike flow 
developed by the heating which causes the liquid existing in the 
boiler to boil, is led, in case of need, to come out of the 
appliance, to perform operations of humidification or heat-cleaning 
of surfaces, or to warm fluids. Typical examples of 
application of this principle are found in several electric 
household appliances used, for instance, for ironing the washing, 
cleaning floors and preparing hot drinks. Among these appliances, those which are used especially in houses 
to thoroughly clean floors and glass pans are at present greatly 
appreciated because of their cleansing efficaciousness, 
associated to a substantial utilization easiness. In fact, the user has at his disposal a handy appliance, capable 
of delivering a steam flow through which a thorough cleaning of 
surfaces is obtained; in this way one does not need to have 
recourse to the traditional and tiresome hand systems, which do 
not ensure, among other things, that really high levels of 
hygiene are reached in the cleaning, given the low temperature 
which cleansing products are traditionally brought to during 
their utilization.  
 The known steam producing appliances utilized have however a 
severe drawback which involves substantial risks for user's 
safety. In the case in point, this drawback is constituted by the 
danger associated to the opening of the tank cap, which can be 
obtained also when said tank contains boiling water and the steam 
developed by same. The different systems realized to try to 
prevent the removal or the simple loosening of the cap are not so 
efficacious as to absolutely exclude such possibility; in fact, 
in most cases, safety devices are utilized which, in the presence 
of tanks under pressure, make the removal or the simple partly 
unscrewing of the cap difficult, but far from impossible. Object of this invention is to obviate the aforementioned 
drawback. More particularly, object of this invention is to

<CLAIMS>
A safety cap for application to a tank of a steam producing 
appliance, comprising a hollow main support body (12) being 

longitudinally bored and having a substantially cylindrical shape and 
a back end (12') for connection to a mouth of the tank, a bush (14) 

fitted on said body (12) and being integral with an external covering 
(18) of plastic material, and a piston (16) fitted inside said body 

(12) for longitudinal displacement between a first position and a 
second position,characterized in that said body (12) comprises two or 

more radial through-holes (26) provided around the circumference 
thereof with a sphere (28) in each through-hole (26), that two or more 

longitudinal grooves (24) of hemispheric cross-section are formed 
along the inner surface of said bush (14) and a groove (36) is formed 

around the perimeter of said piston (16) at a location corresponding 
to the through-holes (26) when said piston (16) is in said second 

position, whereby said spheres (28) protrude from said through-holes 
(26) into said longitudinal grooves (24) if said piston (16) is in the 

first position and said spheres (28) are free to protrude into said 
peripheral groove (36), thereby clearing said longitudinal groove 

(24), if said piston (16) is in the second position. 
The safety cap according to claim 1, wherein the inner surface of 
the bush (14) is provided with four longitudinal grooves (24) arranged 

at 90Â° relatively to one another. 
The safety cap according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each through-hole  
 

(26) of the hollow body (12) is aligned to each groove (24) of the 
bush (14). 
The safety cap according to any of the preceding claims, wherein 
the peripheral groove (36) has a trapezoid section and a depth at 

least equal to half of the diameter of each sphere (28). 
The safety cap according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein 
a spring (34) is located inside the hollow body (12) between a front 

end (16') of the piston (16) and a front end of the hollow body 
(12); a cap (20) with at least one central hole (22) is fitted on the 

front end of said body (12). 
The safety cap according to claim 5, wherein 
the hollow body (12) has a smaller diameter back portion forming an 

annular portion (32) which restrains the travel of the piston (16) 
under tension by the spring (34). 
The safety cap according to any of the preceding claims 5 and 6, wherein 
the bush (14) is blocked on the hollow body (12) by the cap (20) and 

arranged between said cap (20) and an increased diameter annular 
portion (14') of the hollow body (12). 
The safety cap according to any of the preceding claims, wherein 
at least a further groove (40) is formed around the perimeter of the 

piston (16); a toric ring (42) being inserted within said further 
groove (40) to assure the pressure tightness between said piston (16) 

and the inner surface of the hollow body (12). 
The safety cap according to any of the preceding claims, wherein 
a hollow ring (44) is integral to a back end of the piston (16) in  

 
the body portion located near the connection with the tank; said ring 

(44) partly fitting into said piston (16) and having on its front part 
a gasket (46) coupled to a guiding and centering metal support (48); 

and a spring (50) is located inside the piston (16) between said metal 
support (48) and a smaller diameter annular portion (52) provided at 

the front end of the piston (16).
