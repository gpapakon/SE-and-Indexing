<ABSTRACT>
A bead core (2) is coaxially placed around a support drum (6) carrying 
an inflatable air bag (7) disposed in a deflated condition. Clasping 

sectors (14) circumferentially distributed in the drum are radially 
moved close to the inner surface of the bead core (2) to make a 

central portion of a ribbon-like coating structure (3) arranged about 
the inflatable air bag (7), adhere against the bead core itself. 

The air bag is inflated so as to form, on opposite sides relative to 
the bead core (2), two lobes (17, 18) each of them being enclosed 

between the outer surface of the drum (6) and a respective annular 
opposition bell (19, 20) coaxially encircling the drum. By axially 

moving the opposition bells (19, 2o), a first and a second side flap 
of the coating structure (3) are applied to respective surfaces of the 

bead core (2). The second flap overlaps the first flap and is fastened 
thereto on the radially external surface of the bead core (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for looping a
coating structure on bead cores in motor-vehicle tyres.It is known that incorporated in vehicle tyres, at the so-called
"beads" defined along the inner perimetric edges of the tyre itself,
are respective annular metal elements, circumferentially inextensible,
currently referred to as "bead cores"; said bead cores perform a dual
function, that of suitably stiffening the beads themselves for ensuring
their stable connection with the rim on which the tyre is mounted,
and that of providing a steady anchoring to the carcass plies
usually arranged in the tyre itself.In a particular embodiment, especially used with tubeless tyres for
heavy duty motor transport, said bead cores are formed with a plurality
of bare metal wire coils having a right polygonal, preferably
hexagonal section, disposed axially and radially close to each other
so as to constitute an annular element having its radially inner
surface inclined through 15Â° relative to its own axis: a plurality of
clips, usually made of a metal material, distributed along the peripheral
extension of said element and closed at the right section of
same, keeps the element compact and its sectional shape constant
during the tyre manufacturing process.The foregoing being stated, it is to be pointed out that during the
tyre manufacturing process suitable expedients are to be adopted so
that a perfect adhesion of the bead core to the other elastomer
components of the tyre be ensured. The presence of detachment areas
and air bubbles entrapped between the bead core and elastomer material
disposed around said bead core would be in fact very detrimental to
the structure integrity of the tyre in use.To this end, a coating structure made of elastomer material is provided
to be applied to the bead core, which coating is adapted to be 
steadily anchored to the bare metal wires forming the bead core itself
and to provide an appropriate attachment surface for the elastomer
material components to be further assembled therewith.To this end, of the great number of known structures, the structure
described in EP-A-0 492 504,
in the name of the same Applicant has proved to be of particular
interest. It consists of a layer of elastomeric material directly
wrapped on the bead core itself and a rubberized fabric ribbon
provided with reinforcement cords of heat-shrinkable material wrapped
around the elastomeric material layer so that said cords are disposed
in a direction transverse to the longitudinal extension of

extension of the cross-sectional bead core (2) profile;
pressing a plurality of clasping sectors (14) circumferentially
distributed on said support drum (6) against the radially inner

surface (2a) of the bead core (2), in order to fix the mutual positioning
of the bead core (2) and coating structure (3) on the

inflatable air bag (7);
inflating said air bag (7) causing the radial expansion thereof in
order to laterally bend, on opposite sides with respect to the bead

core (2) and upon the action of a first (17) and a second lobe (18)

of the coating structure (3) towards a first and a second side surface
(2b, 2c) of said bead core;
counteracting the radial expansion of said lobes (17, 18) by a first

disposed in coaxial relation around one of said lobes;
axially moving the first annular opposition bell (19) towards said
bead core (2), enfolding around it the first lobe (17) of said air bag

(7) for progressively applying the first side flap (3b) of the coating
structure (3) to the corresponding side surface (2b) and at least one

portion of the radially outer surface (2d) of the bead core (2);

(2) while keeping on with the axial displacement of the second

opposition bell (20) for disengaging said first lobe (17) from the
first side flap (3b) of the coating structure (3) immediately before

the end edge of said second side flap (3c) is applied to the radially
outer surface of the bead core (2) coated with said first flap (3b),
