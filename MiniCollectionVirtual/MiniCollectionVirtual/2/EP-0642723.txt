<ABSTRACT>
A solid state imaging system with improved dead element concealment comprises image displacement means which cyclically displaces the image (20) relative to the array by a distance of at least one inter element pitch (P1, P2), in at least one coordinate direction of the array, so that each resolvable area of the image is focussed cyclically onto at least two different elements (2). By means of signal processing the output of each dead element (24) is replaced by output associated with the same area of the image but recorded by a different element in a previous image position.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Imaging system with dead element concealmentThis invention relates to imaging systems and particularly to solid state systems comprising an array of photoelectric elements, or staring array, for imaging electromagnetic radiation, generally in the visible or infra-red wavebands.One such system comprises a two-dimensional array of charge coupled devices (CCD's). An image incident on the array causes each CCD to produce an electric potential dependent on the intensity of the image. The output from each CCD is recorded in turn and stored in a frame store for subsequent signal processing and storage or display.The resolution of the system depends on the size and spacing of the photoelectric elements in the array and on the quality of each element. By applying conventional data sampling theory to the array it is appreciated that the highest spatial frequency which can be reproduced is equal to half the sampling frequency, which in this case is determined by the inter element pitch. If the image possesses spatial frequencies greater than half the pitch the displayed frequency will be a lower aliased frequency so that high frequency detail is obscured. There is a constant desire for improved spatial resolution, but the size and spacing of the elements in an array are limited by current manufacturing constraints.In order to improve the resolution of such a system GB 215 781 proposes shifting the image relative to the array by a fraction, such as a half or a quarter, of the inter element pitch in either one or both of the coordinate directions of the array. This has the effect of reducing the pitch and hence the spatial frequency of the image which can be reproduced without aliasing.The pixelated displayed image can be difficult to interpret and it is most usual for a system to include some signal processing operations which modify the image before display. These operations may include horizontal and vertical filtering and contrast averaging 

 for example to effectively blurr the edges of each display pixel. These types of operation may actually obscure high frequency detail but are considered necessary in order to enhance the acceptability of the displayed image to the viewer.One such signal processing operation is the effective concealment of non-working or dead elements by averaging the outputs of neighbouring elements associated with neighbouring areas of image. This is generally necessary because present manufacturing constraints mean that 100 element operability is not achievable. In practice the most

CLAIMS
1. An imaging system comprising a two-dimensional array (1) of photoelectric elements (2), focussing means (3) for focussing an optical image (20) on the array (1), signal processing means (6,7t8,9) for processing the output taken from each element and image displacement means (4, .11) wherein the image displacement means is adapted to cyclically displace the image (20) relative to the array (1) in at least one coordinate direction of the array by a distance at least as great as the inter element pitch (pl,p2) in that direction so that each resolvable area of the image is focussed cyclically onto at least two different elements and wherein the signal processing means is adapted to replace the output of each dead element (24) by output associated with the same area of the image but recorded in a previous image position by a different element.
