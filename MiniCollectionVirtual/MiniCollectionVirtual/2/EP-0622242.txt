<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20) for printing images on sheet material (S) has a roller 
platen (24) mounted within a housing (16) for supporting the sheet material 

(S), and a print head mounted adjacent to the platen (24) for receiving the 
sheet material (S) between the platen (24) and the print head (26) and 

printing images onto the sheet material (S). A donor web (W) bearing printing 
ink is interposed between the print head (26) and the sheet material (S) for 

forming graphic images on the sheet material (S). 
Two first wiper-blade assemblies (58) are mounted on either side of the 
roller platen (24) and two second wiper-blade assemblies (92) are mounted 

on either sides of the print head (26), for continuously removing dust 
particles and other debris from both the sheet material (S) and the donor 

web (W) prior to passage between the print head (26) and the roller platen 
(24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing 
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. 
An apparatus of this kind is described in JP-A-59 057 771 
of April 3, 1984. There are numerous types of equipment and 
processes available for printing signs or other 
products with graphic designs, characters or other 
graphic images. Typically, a sheet or web of the 
material upon which the graphic images are printed 
(the "print sheet") is passed between a platen and a 
printing head, and the graphic images are transferred 
or formed on the print sheet by the printing head. 
In some devices, the print sheet is thermally-sensitive, 
and the printing head includes heating 
elements that are selectively activated to form 
graphic images on the thermally-sensitive sheet. In 
other devices, a donor web or foil bearing printing 
ink is passed between the printing head and the print 
sheet. The printing head typically includes heating  
 
elements which are selectively activated to transfer 
ink from the donor web onto the print sheet to form 
graphic images. With the development of computer-aided-design 
(CAD) systems, in the fields of printing and 
signmaking, for example, single or multi-colored 
images can be created and stored in a data base and 
transferred onto a print sheet to produce customized 
signs or other printed matter. In the signmaking 
field, graphic images are printed onto print sheets 
made of vinyl or other plastics secured by a 
pressure-sensitive adhesive on a releasable backing 
material. Once the graphic images are transferred 
to, or formed on a vinyl print sheet, the print sheet 
is cut, typically with an automatic cutter, along the 
outline(s) of the graphic images, and the cut pieces 
are then attached to a sign board by means of the 
pressure-sensitive adhesive after removal of the 
releasable backing material. Sophisticated multi-colored 
and/or enhanced graphic images, including 
two-dimensional images that appear three-dimensional, 
can be readily created and transferred onto a print 
sheet to form such customized signs or other printed 
matter with relative ease and rapidity. The collection of dust particles or other 
debris on the print sheet can significantly degrade  
 
the print quality of the graphic images, particularly 
in more sophisticated systems, which print graphic 
images with a relatively fine degree of resolution. 
Dust particles or other minute debris can cause 
fuzziness, blurring or other aberrations within the 
printed graphic images which can noticeably degrade
