<ABSTRACT>
Hollow fiber membranes (6) can change dimensions upon drying or other processing creating leaks in a tubesheet (3, 4) formed on a fiber bundle (6). An adherent layer (15, 16) is formed in contact with the tubesheet (3, 4) and the fiber membranes (6) therein in a novel method of improving performance. Preferably, the adherent layer (15, 16) is cast from a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A containing an acrylonitrile-modified polyamine curing agent, and preferably the hollow fibers (6) are a cellulose ester.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved tubesheet composition and method of 
forming the tubesheet. In one particular embodiment, an improved method of preparing dry 
cellulose ester hollow fiber membrane device is disclosed. A variety of techniques for drying water-wet cellulose ester membranes are 
known in the prior art. It is essential that the drying be conducted in a manner which does not 
deleteriously affect the pore structure and consequently the membrane characteristics of the 
hollow fibers. U.S. Patent No. 4,430,807 and a number of references cited therein describe 
the displacement of water from cellulose ester membranes using organic solvents. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,127,625 describes the treatment of the membrane with a salt solution followed by 
freeze drying. It has been found convenient to assemble water-wet, cellulose ester hollow fiber 
membranes into a bundle complete with one or more tubesheets and then to dry the bundle. 
U.S. Patents 3,228,876, 3,422,008, 3,455,460 and 3,755,034 are illustrative of some of the 
methods described in the art for fabrication of hollow fiber membrane devices. Techniques 
for the formation of tubesheets on hollow fiber membrane devices are also disclosed in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 3,339,341, 3,423,491, 3,619,459, 3,722,695, 3,728,425 and 4,138,460. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,323,454 suggests at column 4, lines 19-31 that a tubesheet can be cast in successive 
castings. Cellulose ester hollow fiber membranes shrink significantly in cross-section upon 
drying. It has now been discovered that this shrinkage can produce unrelieved tensions, 
distortions, delaminations and cracks in the tubesheet. A convenient method of repairing the 
tubesheet is desirable. A method of preparing a hollow fiber membrane device is described. This 
method comprises sequentially: 
(a) forming at least one tubesheet on a plurality of hollow fiber membranes, 
each of the hollow fiber membranes having a first end, a second end, and a 
lumen extending therebetween, the at least one tubesheet being in part  
 
defined by a first face proximate to and a second face remote from the first 
ends of the hollow fiber membranes; (b) treating the hollow fiber membranes embedded in the tubesheet whereby 
the cross-section of the hollow fiber membranes shrinks to cause gaps 
between the hollow fiber membranes and the tubesheet; (c) casting a liquid resin on the second face of the tubesheet whereby the resin 
penetrates between the hollow fiber membranes and into the gaps; and (d) curing the resin to form at
