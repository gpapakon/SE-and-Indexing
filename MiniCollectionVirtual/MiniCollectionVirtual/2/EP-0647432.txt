<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for preparing a planar surface on the distal femur 
prior to implantation of a femoral knee prosthesis has a femoral plate (12) 

with an opening (13) therein for exposing both condyles of the femur. A guide 
(24) with a central aperture is used to align the femoral plate on the distal 

femur. The guide is releasably secured to the femoral plate and an 
intramedullary guide rod (40) is placed through the aperture therein and into 

the intramedullary canal of the femur. After alignment with the 
intramedullary canal, the femoral plate (12) is pinned to the femur and the 

rod (40) and guide (24) are removed. A milling guide (44) having two bores 
(46,48), one adjacent each condyle, is then placed on the femoral plate and 

an end mill (50) is used to mill a planar surface on at least one of the 
condyles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for preparing a distal
surface of a human femur. More particularly, it relates
to an apparatus that can be used
to prepare the surface of the femur to receive a distal
femoral prosthesis.Various types of instruments and methods have been developed to enable
a surgeon to affix a distal femoral knee prosthesis to a human femur. Since the
purpose for affixing such a prosthesis is to restore the patient's ability to walk
after disease or other traumatic causes have impaired that ability, it is important
that the prosthesis be attached to the femur in a manner that will approximate as
closely as possible the natural condyles which the prosthesis is replacing.It is a common practice to use the long central axis of the femur as a guide
in determining the manner in which the distal femoral surfaces should be shaped
to receive a properly aligned distal femoral prosthesis. Using the long central axis
of the femur as a guide, a planar distal cut is first made on the distal femur and
then the guide is removed and additional instrumentation utilizes the planar distal
surface as a reference from which to cut anterior and posterior cuts, followed by
anterior and posterior chamfer cuts.Patents showing such a method or methods similar thereto are U.S.
Patents 4,474,177 and 4,721,104. The former patent relates to a series of
instruments for preparing the distal femur in which an angled alignment guide is
used to index a plateau planar which is used to prepare the planar distal surface
of the femur. The latter patent relates to a surgical apparatus for preparing the
intracondylar area of the distal femur. U.S. Patent 5,047,032 relates to a surgical instrument designed to produce a
planar distal femoral surface. A router or side cutting drill is used to form the
surface. Another patent which relates to the preparation of the distal femur is U.S.
Patent 4,787,383, in which a saw is used to make the planar femoral cut. A saw
guide is also disclosed. EP-A-0554959 discloses an apparatus for producing a planar
surface on a portion of bone using an end milling device comprising a plate having an
opening therein forming a guide means, means for securing the plate to the bone and a
milling guide block coupled to the plate, said block having a reference surface and a track
such that the milling device engages the reference surface to control the depth of cut and the
milling device may be guided along the track in two dimensions to cut the bone a
predetermined distance from the reference
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for milling a distal femoral surface containing the media and
lateral condyles of a femur (60) having an intramedullary canal (76),
 said apparatus
comprising


a femoral plate (10) having a generally oblong opening (13) therein adapted
for exposing both the media and distal condyles (62,64) when said plate is secured

to the distal end of said femur;
means for securing said femoral plate (10) to said distal end ;
a milling guide block (44) coupled to said femoral plate, said guide block (44)
having an outer surface (42) conforming to said generally oblong opening on said

femoral plate for receipt therein and having a pair of cylindrical medial and lateral
guide bores (46,48) therein for location adjacent the respective medal and lateral

condyles; and
a cylindrical end mill cutter (50) for insertion in at least one of said medial and
lateral bores in said guide block for milling at least one of said medial and lateral

condyles.
The apparatus for milling a distal femoral surface as set forth in claim 1
wherein said milling guide block (44) has a stop surface (47) for engaging a radially

extending guide surface (55) on said cylindrical end mill to permit the milling of said
condyles to a predetermined depth.
The apparatus for milling a distal femoral surface as set forth in claim 2
further including at least one spacer (80) for insertion between said guide surface

(55) on said end mill and said stop surface (47) on said milling guide block to vary
said predetermined depth of said milling of said condyles.
The apparatus for milling a distal femoral surface as set forth in claim
1,2 or 3 wherein said medial and lateral guide bores (46,48) in said milling guide

block are circular and are off center with respect to a plane containing the longitudinal
axis (14) of said femoral plate such that when said block is used on said femur, said

guide bores are offset in the anterior-posterior direction with respect to a mediallateral
plane through the femur to allow for milling a generally oval planar surface on

each condyle by flipping said block 180 degrees and thereby interchanging the guide
bore adjacent each condyle used to make an initial cut.
