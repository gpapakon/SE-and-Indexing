<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises an internal combustion engine, 
specifically diesel engine that includes a precombustion chamber (75) 

in the cylinder head (71). The precombustion chamber is formed 
primarily by a recess formed in the main combustion chamber and 

an insert piece (81) that is interlocked in any of a variety of 
different matters to the cylinder head casting (71). Various 

arrangements for achieving the interlocked are disclosed and 
these include pressing and/or welding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine indicated in the preamble of claim 1.In many types of engines, particularly diesel engines,
there is provided in addition to the main combustion chamber
a sub or precombustion chamber in which combustion is
initiated. The combustion from this prechamber then causes
the mixture in the main chamber to ignite and normally some
form of throat section interconnects the prechamber and the
main chamber and through which the hot gases may emanate.Although these types of constructions provide very good
performance under all running conditions, the actual
formation of the cylinder head and prechamber cause some
problems. Specifically, in addition to forming a main
combustion chamber surface, the interior of the cylinder head
must be formed with the prechamber and the relatively narrow
throat that connects the prechamber to the main chamber. It
is not practical for a variety of reasons to form the
cylinder head as a single unitary construction when a
prechamber is employed. The reason for this is if the
casting and machining techniques become very difficult due to
the small throat that interconnects the prechamber with the
main chamber.Therefore, it has been the practice to form at least a
portion of the prechamber in a cylinder head casting and to
use a prechamber insert that is fixed somehow to the cylinder
head and which forms the lower end of the prechamber and the
throat which connects the prechamber to the main chamber.Obviously, such multiple part constructions give rise to
difficulties in assembly and maintaining the components
together. For example, it could be disastrous to the engine
if the insert piece were to fall out of the cylinder head 
during the engine operation. In addition, it is normally the
practice to form the insert piece from a different material
than the main cylinder head material and this gives rise to
additional problems caused by uneven thermal expansions and
cooling rates.One way in which the insert piece has been affixed to
the cylinder head is to form the insert piece and have it
extend through an opening in a mating surface of the cylinder
head. This insert piece is then held in place by a cap
installed on the outside of the cylinder head. However, this
type of construction presents considerable problems in
conjunction with sealing since it is necessary to seal the
insert piece and cylinder head around the entire opening in
which the insert piece is received.Another type of construction is shown in Figure 1 of the
drawings
