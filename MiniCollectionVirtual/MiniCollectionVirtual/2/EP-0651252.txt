<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus detects a target reactant that binds 
to an immobilized reactant. The apparatus generates a 

holographic image at a predetermined location when the 
reactants are present and bound to one another. The 

immobilized reactant is bound to a support surface (212) 
at selected locations. The locations are chosen such 

that a holographic plate is generated when the target 
reactant binds to the immobilized reactant. An 

associated method may be used to detect antibody-antigen 
reactions, the binding of two strands of nucleic acid, 

the binding of an enzyme to one of its substrates, and 
so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biological assays, 
and more particularly, to an improved method and 
apparatus for detecting the binding of an organic 
molecule of interest to a substrate. Reactions between biological molecules exhibit an 
extremely high degree of specificity. It is this 
specificity that provides a living cell with the ability 
to carry out thousands of chemical reactions 
simultaneously in the same "vessel". In general, this 
specificity arises from the "fit" between two molecules 
having very complex surface topologies. For example, an 
antibody binds a molecule displaying an antigen on its 
surface because the antibody contains a pocket whose 
shape is the complement of a protruding area on the 
antigen. This type of specific binding between two 
molecules forms the basis of numerous biological assays. For example, the binding between an antibody and 
molecules displaying a particular antigenic group on 
their surface may be used as the basis for detecting the 
presence of the antibody, molecules carrying the 
antigenic group, or the antigenic group itself. This 
type of assay forms the basis of numerous medical 
diagnostic tests. All of these tests depend on 
detecting and measuring the binding of an antibody 
molecule that is specific for a particular antigenic 
group to a molecule carrying the group in question. In 
general, one of the two molecular species is immobilized 
on a support surface where it acts as a "glue" for 
binding the other species. In one class of assays, in  
 
which either the antibody or the molecule carrying the 
antigenic group is to be assayed, one of the two species 
is covalently immobilized to the support and the other 
is free in solution. The immobilized species is exposed 
to the solution that may contain the soluble species and 
the amount of material bound to the immobilized species 
after the exposure is measured. In a second class of 
assays in which the antigenic group itself is to be 
assayed, one of the two species is covalently 
immobilized to the support and the other is 
electrostatically bound to the covalently immobilized 
species. A solution containing a small molecule having 
the antigenic group thereon will interfere with the 
electrostatic binding. This leads to the release of the 
electrostatically bound species. These assays detect 
the degree of release of the electrostatically bound 
species. Antibodies and antigen carrying molecules are but 
one of a number of classes of biological molecules whose 
binding can form the basis
