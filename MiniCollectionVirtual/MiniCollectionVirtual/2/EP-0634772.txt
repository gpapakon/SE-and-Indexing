<ABSTRACT>
An electron beam aperture (1a) of a second grid electrode 
(2, 11) of a color cathode ray tube is a rectangular hole 

and formed in the center of a slit-like recess (1b) having 
longer sides extending in the horizontal direction. The 

vertical width (d) of the rectangular hole is greater than 
the width (w) of each shorter side of the slit-like recess 

(1b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron gun 
having an electrode structure improved in focusing 
characteristic and to a color cathode ray tube using such 
an electron gun. In general, in a color cathode ray tube such as a 
color cathode ray tube or a color monitor tube, to 
implement a so-called self-convergence function which 
causes a plurality of electron beams to converge on a 
phosphor screen without applying a special external 
correcting magnetic field on them, deflection magnetic 
fields for deflecting the electron beams emitted from an 
electron gun are given predetermined distortions. For this reason, the electron beams are subjected to 
deflection distortion while passing through the deflection 
magnetic fields, and form beam spots accompanied by haloes 
in the direction perpendicular to scanning lines, in the 
peripheral portion of a screen (phosphor screen), 
particularly in each corner portion of the screen. Thus, 
the focusing characteristic of the electron gun is 
degraded in such portions and, hence, the image quality is 
degraded.  
 To attain the uniformity of the focusing 
characteristic over the entire screen, recesses each 
having a rectangular shape, i.e., so-called slits, are 
formed in a second grid electrode which constitutes the 
electron gun in such a manner that electron beam apertures 
are respectively located in the slit-shaped recesses. Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) are explanatory views showing the 
structure of the second grid electrode used in the 
above-described conventional electron gun. Fig. 1(a) is a 
front view viewed from the first grid electrode side, 
and Fig. 1(b) is a cross-sectional view taken along line 
A-A of Fig. 1(a). An electron beam aperture la of a second grid 
electrode 2 is a circular hole which pierces the center 
of a slit-shaped recess 1b formed and elongated 
horizontally in a plate which constitutes the second grid 
electrode. The diameter of the electron beam aperture 1a 
is smaller than the length of each shorter side of the 
slit-like recess 1b. The slit-like recess 1b is formed by 
coining in one plate which constitutes the second grid 
electrode, so that the slit-like recess 1b has a 
rectangular cross section which is open outwardly to a 
small extent from the bottom of the recess toward the open 
end, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Specifically, in the shown conventional electrode 
structure, a distance d1 exists between each longer side  
 
of the slit-like recess 1b and the edge of the electron 
beam aperture 1a, in the vertical direction,
