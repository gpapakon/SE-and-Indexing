<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device for carrying out the method for the fully automatic laying and folding of textile products of elongate shape are based on four stations each having revolving silicone-coated bands (Fig. 9). The stocking arrives on the band (1) and is transported further with the same direction of rotation by the band (2). In the correct positioning, the laying arm (28) extracts the winding card (10) from the winding-card magazine (15) and lays it onto the stocking (31) located on the band (1). The bands (2) and (3) are raised by means of a hydraulic device (11) and (13). By varying the direction of rotation and opening of the bands (2) and (3), the stocking, together with the winding card (10), is drawn into the rotating bands (2) and (3) and is applied 1/3-folded onto the band (4) which is provided with eight rotating silicone-coated bands. The further folding operations take place on the band (4), initially by means of the first rake (56) as well as the folding rake (57) and the offsettable rake (58), the rake (58), offset at 180@, bringing about the final folding in a left-hand fold instead of a right-hand fold. The positioning takes place by means of two photoelectric switches (49) and (50). After the final folding, the stocking is transferred to the band (61) which has a braking and also accelerating function. The eight rotating silicone-coated bands transport the stocking or the hosiery article to the packaging station. Integrated into this station (61) are seven stripping fingers (65) which prevent the stocking from being drawn into the machine. The entire device (Fig. 9) is controlled electronically (44), so that the advantage of higher efficiency and rapidity is afforded in relation to the machines known hitherto.
