<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with new hypolipidaemic compounds,
with processes and novel intermediates for their preparation, with
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and with their use in
medicine, particularly in the prophylaxis and treatment of
hyperlipidaemic conditions, such as atherosclerosis.Hypolipidaemic conditions are often associated with elevated plasma
concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Such concentrations may
be reduced by decreasing the absorption of bile acids from the
intestine. One method by which this may be achieved is to inhibit the
bile acid active uptake system in the terminal ileum. Such inhibition
stimulates the conversion of cholesterol to bile acid by the liver and
the resulting increase in demand for cholesterol produces a
corresponding increase in the rate of clearance of LDL and VLDL
cholesterol from the blood plasma or serum.There has now been identified a novel class of heterocyclic compounds
which reduce the plasma or serum concentrations of LDL and VLDL
cholesterol and in consequence are particularly useful as
hypolipidaemic agents. By decreasing the concentrations of
cholesterol and cholesterol ester in the plasma, the compounds of the
present invention retard the build-up of atherosclerotic lesions and
reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease-related events. The
latter are defined as cardiac events associated with increased
concentrations of cholesterol and cholesterol ester in the plasma or
serum.For the purposes of this specification. a hyperlipidaemic condition is
defined as any condition wherein the total cholesterol concentration
(LDL + VLDL) in the plasma or serum is greater than 240mg/dL
(6.21mmol/L) (J. Amer. Med. Assn. 256. 20. 2849-2858 (1986)). USP 3,362,962 describes a genus of benzothiazepines outside the scope
of the present invention which have muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant
activity; there is no disclosure in the patent specification that the
compounds described therein may be useful as hypolipidaemic agents.According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of
formula (I)

wherein
l is an integer of from 0 to 4;m is an integer of from 0 to 5;n is an integer of from 0 to 2;R and R' are atoms or groups independently selected from halogen,
nitro, phenylalkoxy, C1-4 alkoxy, C1-6 alkyl and -O(CH2)pSO3R" wherein
p is an integer of from 1 to 4 and R" is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl,
