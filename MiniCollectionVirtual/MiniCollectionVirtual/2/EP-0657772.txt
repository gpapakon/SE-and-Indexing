<ABSTRACT>
A liquefying apparatus for melting and blending 
solid materials includes a hopper (10) with a coiled (13) heating 

element disposed therein which supports and melts the solid 
materials into liquid form. The hopper (10) is segmented into a 

plurality of compartments and as the solid material melts 
the liquid is collected in the lower portion (7) of the hopper (10). 

The collected liquid is continuously agitated to ensure 
that there are no concentration pockets. The lower section 

is also provided with a deaeration device (39) to prevent 
entrained air from entering the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for liquefying solid materials. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an on 
demand in-line liquefier which blends and liquefies 
multiple batches of solid chunks of aqueous gelatin 
emulsions. Typical emulsion coating operations require 
liquid kettle blending to smooth batch-to-batch emulsion 
variability during long coating events. Conventional 
continuous liquefaction technology requires quick 
chilling, and/or pelletization, and solid blending 
equipment to pre-blend the emulsion in solid form. This 
technology is described in United States Patent 
5,182,190. In United States Patent Application Serial No. 
07/815,462, a modified passive liquefaction system is 
described. In this system, a liquefying apparatus having 
a hopper which includes an upper and lower section is 
described. The upper section is adapted to receive a 
meltable solid material and has a coiled tube disposed 
therein. The coil tube supports, melts and passes the 
melted solid material therethrough such that the 
liquefied product is stored in the lower section of the 
hopper and subsequently drawn off. Use of this 
technology with United States Patent 5,182,190 allows one 
to first blend the solid material, and then passively 
liquefy the gelled material. The present invention is a method which allows 
one to mix and blend solid gelled chunk material in the 
same operation, thereby eliminating solid blending 
equipment and increasing productivity of the operation.  The present invention is an apparatus and 
method for processing a plurality of meltable solid 
components. The invention includes a hopper having an 
upper section for receiving the plurality of meltable 
solid components, the upper section being divided into a 
plurality of compartments wherein each of the plurality 
of solid components is loadable into one of the plurality 
of compartments. Each of said plurality of compartments 
divides a cross section of the upper section of the 
hopper into an area. The hopper also includes a lower 
section for storing the melted components. A coiled tube 
is disposed in the upper section at the cross section of 
the hopper for supporting and melting the meltable solid 
components. The rate of melting of each of the plurality 
of components is approximately equal to the area of each 
of the compartments. A mixer is disposed in the lower 
section for agitating the liquid at a rate which 
minimizes air entrainment. Liquid removal means are 
provided for
