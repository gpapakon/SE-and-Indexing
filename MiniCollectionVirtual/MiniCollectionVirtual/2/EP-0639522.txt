<ABSTRACT>
A brightness pattern of a document (71, 101) is stored 
in a memory. At least a part (73, 102, 105) of another 

document (71, 101) is optically scanned. The scanned 
brightness pattern is compared with the stored brightness 

pattern. When more than a specified minimum extent of 
agreement between the scanned and the stored brightness 

patterns is found, a signal is generated. The composition of 
the set is carried out in accordance with that signal. 
Because scanned brightness patterns are compared with a 
brightness pattern of a document, a random brightness pattern 

present on a document can be used for controlling the 
composition of the set. 
Further, an apparatus for practicing the method 
according to the invention is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for assembling sets of
documents wherein documents are successively fed and gathered
into sets.According to a method known from practice, the
composition of sets of documents which have been fed
separately is controlled by counting, during the formation of
each set, the number of documents being fed and discharging
gathered documents collectively when according to the count a
specified number of documents have been gathered. This number
should be set at the desired number of documents per set.A drawback associated with this known method is that the
risk of counting errors is substantial. Moreover, an error
also affects the composition of subsequent sets, so that
following an error the subsequent sets do not contain the
correct documents either but contain one or more documents of
a next or a preceding set. Counting errors may for instance
arise when two documents are being fed simultaneously instead
of consecutively. A further drawback of this known method is
that the number of supplied documents that are to be
discharged simultaneously as a set has to be set anew whenever
a set consisting of a different number of documents than the
preceding set is to be gathered. This means that this method
does not enable efficient implementation of the composition of
sets consisting of different numbers of documents in random
order. According to U.S. Patent 3,260,517, for the composition
of sets of documents, use is made of several feeding stations
each loaded with a number of identical documents. For the
composition of the sets, documents are fed by one or more of
the feeding stations. For each set, different combinations of
feeding stations can be selected for feeding documents. The
selection of the feeding stations occurs in accordance with
signals which have been read from a main document. These
signals represent the set composition instructions for a set
to be composed starting from the main document in question.A drawback of this known method is that for each series
of sets to be composed, it must be specified which documents
are to be loaded into which feeding stations, and that these
documents must then be loaded into the feeding stations prior
to the preparation of that series of sets.A further drawback is that if an error is made in
drawing up the specification of the documents to be loaded
into the feeding stations or in loading those documents, so
that a feeding station is loaded with other documents than was
envisaged in drawing up the main document, a different
document
