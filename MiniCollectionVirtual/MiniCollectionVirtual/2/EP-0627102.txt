<ABSTRACT>
A system for transmitting data (NCC) between a computer bus (PSB) and a network (RE), including (1) a general purpose unit (GPU) connected to the bus and to a network-connected adapter, and including a first microprocessor and a unit for transferring frames between the bus and the adapter, and vice versa, comprising a dual port memory connected therebetween; and (2) a communication coprocessor (PPA) connected to the general purpose unit (GPU). Said coprocessor (PPA) includes a second microprocessor (CPU3) implementing, for each communication layer (C2-C4), the corresponding protocol by providing each frame with control data adapted to said protocol, said second microprocessor being connected to the first microprocessor and the memory; and a third microprocessor (CPU4) providing direct memory access management of data transfer between the second microprocessor (CPU3) and the memory (VRAM).
