<ABSTRACT>
A device gamut boundary surface in a 
device independent color space (DICS) is defined by 

a set of small triangles. Each triangle in the DICS 
corresponds to a triangle on the surface of a color 

cube in a device dependent color space (DDCS). The 
triangles in the DDCS are derived based on a look-up 

table which can be obtained by measuring a set of 
color patches produced from the given device. A 

small set of carefully selected gamut boundary 
points or signals in the DICS are determined and 

their corresponding signals or points on the surface 
of the color cube in the DDCS are computed. These 

data are stored in a table called a gamut 
descriptor. Gamut descriptor signals or points can 

be determined by a convex polyhedral cone inclusion 
process and their corresponding signals in the DDCS 

can be determined by triangle interpolation. The 
gamut descriptor usually includes gamut boundary 

signals at a number of lightness layers along a 
series of predetermined hue angles. The gamut 

descriptor is a compact representation of the gamut 
boundary. The signal distribution pattern in a 

gamut descriptor provides useful information for 
determining in-gamut and out-of-gamut signals and 

for fast mapping between color spaces in cross-media 
color calibration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to concurrently filed
applications EP-A-0626781 and EP-A-0626782 entitled "Method
And Apparatus For Mapping Between Color Spaces And Creating
A Three Dimensional Inverse Look-up Table" and "Method and
Apparatus For Convex Interpolation For Color Calibration"
respectively.The present application is directed to a
method and apparatus for creating a gamut descriptor
used for converting color data from one color space
to another color space and, more particularly, to a
system which allows fast color calibration using a
carefully selected set of gamut boundary points in a
device independent color space.A prior art method and apparatus for input/output
colour gamut transformation is known from US-A-5185661.A color device such as CRT or printer is
driven by 3 or 4 color signals to produce or display
colors. Color signals for CRTs are R (red), G
(green), B (blue), while color signals for printers
are C (cyan), M (magenta), Y (yellow) and an
additional signal K (black) may be used for some
printers. A color space which uses R,G,B or CMY
signals is called a device dependent color space 
(DDCS). The R,G,B or C,M,Y signals are usually
integers from 0 to 255. For a printer, the signal
range of C,M,Y is bounded by a device color range
cube or color cube 10 as depicted in Figure 1. In
total, there are typically 256x256x256 (about 16.6
million) different combinations of code values or
signals in the cube 10, and therefore the printer
can produce 256x256x256 different colors. Each
color produced by the printer can be measured by
conventional physical instruments measuring a
printer produced color patch to determine its
location (a point) or color signal in standard
CIEXYZ color space, a device independent color space
(DICS), which can then be conventionally converted
into a point (or color signal) in standard CIEL*a*b*
space or CIELUV space, which are device independent
color spaces (DICSs). The range (volume) occupied
by the 256x256x256 points of the color cube 10, when
converted into signals in the CIEL*a*b* space, is
called the gamut 12 of the device. By definition, a
device gamut means or defines all the colors (in
CIEL*a*b*) that the device can produce. Colors
located on the gamut 12 boundary in CIEL*a*b*, the
device independent color space, are produced by the
signal values on the surface of the color cube 10 in
CMY, the device dependent color space.Using the above method, one can determine
the gamut of a given printer precisely. However,
this method would require measuring about 16.6
mi
