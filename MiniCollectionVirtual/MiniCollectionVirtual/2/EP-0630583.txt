<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a low fat, 
high moisture peanut butter composition containing from 0 

to 50% peanut flour having less than about 1% peanut oil 
and from 0 to about 50% of a fat containing peanut source 

selected from the group consisting of peanut paste from 
non-defatted peanuts having about 50% peanut oil and 

partially defatted peanut paste having from about 12% to 
about 30% peanut oil. The peanut flour and peanut paste 

are present in the composition at a level sufficient to 
provide from about 10% to about 24% of peanut protein. 

The composition also optionally includes from 0 to about 
10% of a protein source selected from the group 

consisting of whey protein isolate, peanut protein 
isolate and whey protein concentrate. The peanut butter 

composition has from about 23% to about 40% moisture. 
The peanut butter composition also includes a humectant 

and emulsifier system comprising sorbitol, lecithin, 
glycerine, sodium stearoyl lactylate, xanthan gum and may 

optionally include polyphosphate. The humectant and 
emulsifier system is present at a level sufficient to 

provide a water activity (Aw) of less than about 0.91. 
The peanut butter composition has from about 1% to about 

25% of vegetable oil, preferably peanut oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a reduced 
fat peanut butter spread and a method for manufacture 
thereof. More particularly, the present invention is 
directed to producing a peanut butter spread having 
reduced fat, high protein and a high level of moisture 
which is shelf stable at ambient temperatures. Conventional peanut butter is prepared from 
shelled peanuts roasted at about 170° C. which are 
thereafter cooled to about 30° C. These roasted peanuts 
are then blanched, the skins and nibs are removed and the 
blanched kernels are split into halves. The blanched, 
split peanuts are then coarsely ground and to the 
coarsely ground nuts are added optional ingredients, such 
as sweetener, salt and hydrogenated vegetable oil. All 
of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and are then 
finely ground. This mixture is then cooled and packed 
into jars. Peanut butter is a highly nutritious food 
containing high levels of protein. However, peanut 
butter also contains relatively large quantities of fat. 
A typical peanut butter product will have an oil content 
of about 50%, a protein content of about 29% and a fiber 
content of 1 to 2%. Sugars, carbohydrates and moisture 
normally constitute the rest of the product. The 
moisture level is usually less than about 2%. Due to the 
low moisture level and the high level of oil, peanut 
butter is a highly stable product which can be kept 
unrefrigerated for substantial periods of time. To be labeled "peanut butter" under the 
applicable regulations of the United States Food and Drug 
Administration, the peanut ingredients must comprise at 
least 90% of the weight of the finished product, 21  
 
C.F.R. §164.150. If more than 10% of the peanut product 
consists of non-peanut ingredients, then the product may 
be termed a "peanut spread", 21 C.F.R. §102.23(a) so long 
as it meets all of the conditions set forth in 21 C.F.R. 
§102.23(b). One of these conditions is that the protein 
content of the product is at least 24% by weight of the 
finished product. There has been a substantial amount of research 
directed to reducing the oil content and, thus, the 
calorie content of peanut butter. One of the most common 
methods for effectively decreasing the amount of calories 
per unit volume in food products is the addition of water 
as a non-calorie ingredient together with a thickener or 
emulsifier to duplicate the texture of the original 
product. However, the addition of water adversely 
affects the flavor, color, texture and mouthfeel of 
peanut butter products.
