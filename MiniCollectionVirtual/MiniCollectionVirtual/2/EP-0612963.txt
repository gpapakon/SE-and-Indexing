<ABSTRACT>
A distributor unit (1) for heating and/or cooling systems operated by a heat carrier capable of flowing consists of a tubular housing (2) intended for vertical installation, in which a tube (5) of smaller cross-section is arranged coaxially and concentrically with the housing wall. The inner tube (5) forms an inner distributor chamber (6) and the annular space between the latter and the wall of the housing (2) forms an outer distributor chamber (7). In two planes (II-II and IV-IV) running at right angles to the longitudinal axis (Z-Z) of the housing (2) there are provided in each case radially running connections (10, 11, 12 and 13, 14, 15, respectively) to the outer (7) and inner (6) distributor chamber, respectively. Further connections (8, 9, 16) to the inner distributor chamber (6) are arranged at the end faces (3, 4) of the housing (2) and in an intermediate plane (III-III), respectively. The heating-circuit distributor (1) intended for vertical insertion by its longitudinal axis (Z-Z) can be pivoted for different installation not only about its longitudinal axis (Z-Z) but also about 180 degrees about its transverse axis and used in such a way that the inner and the outer distributor chamber can be used both as flow and as return chamber.

A manifold unit (1) for heating and cooling 
installations operating with a fluid heat transfer medium, 

having connections for a plurality of circuits, wherein the 
fittings and connecting parts required for feeding the 

medium and for controlling and monitoring are combined in 
pipe runs extending parallel to one another for the forward 

flow and return flow of a respective circuit to form an 
assembly, comprising a tubular housing (2), in which an 

inner tube (5) of smaller cross-section is arranged 
coaxially and concentrically to the housing wall, wherein 

the inner tube (5) forms an inner manifold chamber (6) and 
the annular chamber between the latter and the wall of the 

housing (2) forms an outer manifold chamber (7),
 
characterised in that the housing (2) intended for vertical 

installation is provided in two planes (II-II and IV-IV), 
extending at right angles to the longitudinal axis (Z-Z) of 

the housing (2) and at a distance apart, with respectively 
at least two radially directed connections (10,11,13,14), of 

which respectively two connections (10,11 and 13,14) form an 
angle of 90Â° with one another and are disposed in the same 

direction with respect to the longitudinal axis (Z-Z) of the 
housing (2), wherein the connections (10,11) of the first 

plane (II-II) are connected with the outer manifold chamber 
(7) and the connections (13,14) of the second plane are 

connected with the inner manifold chamber (6), and finally 
wherein at the end faces (3,4) of the housing (2) 

there are disposed respective axially directed connections 
(8,9) to the inner manifold chamber (6). 
A manifold unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that in the two planes (II-II and IV-IV)  

 
respectively there is provided a further radially extending 

connection (12,15) to the outer manifold chamber (7). 
A manifold unit according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the further radially extending 

connections (12,15) are disposed in the same direction with 
respect to the longitudinal axis (Z-Z) of the housing (2). 
A manifold unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that in at least one further 

plane (III-III) extending at right angles to the 
longitudinal axis there is provided at least one further 

connection (16) to the inner manifold chamber (6) and/or to 
the outer manifold chamber (7). 
A manifold unit according to Claim 4, 

characterised in that the further plane (III-III) is 
situated with its connection (16) between the first and 

second planes (II-II and IV-IV). 
A manifold unit according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that both the inner tube (5) 

and the housing (2) are of circular cross-section.
