<ABSTRACT>
An anchor bracket is intended for hanging U-profile rails (1) with a vertical web surface (2) and horizontal flanges (3) or for suspending a load on such U-profile rails (1). The anchor bracket is configured in two parts and exhibits an essentially L-shaped main bracket part (5), whose long leg (7), bearing on the web surface (2) of the U-profile rail (1), projects beyond the web surface (2) with one end (7a) and, at its other end (7b) is connected, via an angled-off horizontal leg (9), to a folded-back retaining lug (10) which engages around the free edge (3a) of one flange (3). A locking part (6) bearing on the outer side of the other flange (4) is connected, at one end, to a retaining lug (12) which engages around the free edge (4a) of the flange (4), and, at its other end, is fastened, by means of an angled-off fastening lug (13), on the main bracket part (5).

<CLAIMS>
An anchor bracket for U-shaped sections (1) provided 
with a vertical web area (2) and horizontal flanges (3,4) 

for the suspension of U-shaped sections (1) or attaching 
a load, with the anchor bracket including an essentially 

L-shaped bracket body (5), with a long leg (7) located on 
the web area (2) of the U-shaped section (1), projecting 

with one end (7a) over the web area (2), including an 
angled horizontal leg (9) at its other end (7b) and with 

a locking section (6) located on the outside of the other 
flange (4), being connected at one end to a retaining 

plate (12) encompassing the free edge (4a) of the flange 
(4), with the anchor bracket consisting of two parts, 

characterised in that the angled horizontal leg (9) of 
the bracket body (5) is connected to a folded back 

retaining plate (10) encompassing the free edge (3a) of 
one flange (3), that the locking section (6) located on 

the outside of the flange (4) is attached to an angled 
retaining plate (13) on the bracket body (5), that the 

bracket body (5) and the locking section (6) consist of a 

bent flat material and including longitudinal reinforcing 
beads (17) of identical dimensions and distance from each 

other in the bracket body (5) and in the locking section 
(6) and that the reinforcing beads are each designed as a 

double bead (17) including two moulded beads (18), 
extending from the metal sheet level in opposite 

directions, directly blending into each other via a 
transition piece (19) ascending between one bead (18) and 

the other bead (18). 
An anchor bracket according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the long leg (7) of the bracket 

body (5) includes a multitude of bores (16) for 
alternative fastening of the locking section (6).  

 
An anchor bracket according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the locking section (6) is bolted 

to the bracket body (5). 
An anchor bracket according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that two reinforcing beads (17) are 

provided parallel to and at a distance from each other.
