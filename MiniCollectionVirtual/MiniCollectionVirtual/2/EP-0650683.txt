<ABSTRACT>
Lid for a cooking vessel, with a lid ring (12) which is constructed as a zone of a spheroidal segment facing the vessel and the mean diameter of which corresponds approximately to the inside diameter of the vessel, a lid surface (14) which is connected to the lid ring and is in the form of a spheroidal segment, and a lid grip which has two grip pieces mounted on the lid ring opposite one another and on the side of the lid ring facing away from the vessel, and two grip brackets (26, 28) which interconnect said grip pieces, extend at a mutual distance parallel to one another over the lid surface and are curved to the side facing away from the vessel, characterised in that the lid ring (12) and the lid surface (14) are integral components of a spheroidal cap (10) curved convexly to the vessel and with a uniform radius of curvature.

A lid for a cooking-pot comprising a ring (12) in 
the form of a zone of a spheroidal portion pointing 

towards the pot and having an average diameter 
approximately equal to the inner diameter of the pot, a 

lid surface (14) connected to the ring and in the form 
of a spheroidal portion and a lid handle comprising two 

parts (16, 18) mounted on the ring on the side remote 
from the pot and two curved handles (26, 28) which 

connect the handle parts, extend parallel to and at a 
distance from one another over the lid surface and are 

curved towards the side remote from the pot, 
characterised in that the ring (12) and the surface 

(14) are one-piece components of a spheroidal cap (10) 
having a uniform radius of curvature and a convex 

curvature towards the pot. 
A lid according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the spheroidal cap has a uniform radius of curvature. 
A lid according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the spheroidal cap is a spherical cap (10). 
A lid according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the spheroidal cap (10) is an 

all-glass cap. 
A lid according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the curved handles (26, 28) are of metal.  

 
A lid according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the curved handles (26, 28) each 

have a circular cross-section. 
A lid according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the handle parts (16, 18) are of 

plastic. 
A lid according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the handle parts (16, 18) are 

connected to the spheroidal cap (10) by bolts (20, 22) 
which each extend through the cap (10) near its 

peripheral edge. 
A lid according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the distance between the bolts (20, 22) and the 

peripheral edge of the spheroidal cap (10) is such 
that, when the lid is fitted on the pot, the part of 

the bolts (20, 22) extending through the cap (10) lies 
inside the inner diameter of the upper edge of the pot. 
A lid according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the distance between the bolts (20, 22) and the 

peripheral edge of the spheroidal cap (10) is such 
that, when the lid is fitted on the pot, the part of 

the bolts (20, 22) extending through the cap (10) lies 
outside the inner diameter of the upper edge of the 

pot.
