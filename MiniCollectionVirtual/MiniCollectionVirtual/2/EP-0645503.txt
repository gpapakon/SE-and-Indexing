<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an intermediate layer (4) in a wall (1) comprising a plurality of layers. Said intermediate layer (4) is located between an insulation layer (2) and a boundary layer (3). The intermediate layer (4) comprises a substrate material (7) and moulding-like strips (9) which are attached on the substrate material (7) by an adhesive layer (8). Adjacent strips form a duct (10) which permits the introduction of installation lines (5).
