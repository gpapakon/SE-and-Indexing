<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an apparatus for deburring slabs (1) from a continuous-casting installation and which are cut to the desired length by means of oxy-cutting, of the type comprising a rotor (10) carrying, at its periphery, self-retractable hammers (11). The rotor (10) comprises a hub (12) on which are fastened, at each end, a bearing plate (bottom-step cheek) (13) in the form of a circular shell and, between these two bearing plates (13), pairs (14) of bearing half-plates (15) in the form of circular half-shells, which are adjacent and opposite. Each pair (14) of bearing half-plates (15) is uniformly spaced in the longitudinal direction of the hub (12) and one of the bearing half-plates (15) of each pair (14) is offset in the said longitudinal direction with respect to the other of the bearing half-plates (15) of the said pair (14). A further subject of the invention is a rotor used in this type of deburring apparatus.

Machine for trimming slabs (1) which have been issued from
a continuous casting plant and cut to the desired length by

oxygen cutting, of the type comprising a rotor (10), mounted
horizontally in a frame and bearing at its periphery self-retracting

hammers (11), the heads (110) of which describe a
shell during rotation of the rotor (10) and means for the

vertical displacement of the rotor (10) for moving said shell by
said hammers (11) approximately tangentially to the lower face

of said slabs (1), said rotor (10) comprising a hub (12) on
which there is fixed at each end (10a, 10b) an entrance cheek

(13) in the form of a circular ferrule,

characterised in that

the hub (12) comprises, between these two entrance cheeks (13),
pairs (14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) which are in the form of

a circular half-ferrule and are adjacent and opposite, each pair
(14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) being spaced at regular

intervals in the longitudinal direction of the hub (12) and one
of the half-entrance cheeks (15) of each pair (14) being offset

in the said longitudinal direction relative to the other of the
half-entrance cheeks (15) of the pair (14) and said entrance

cheeks (13) and said half-entrance cheeks (15) receiving an
assembly of articulation pins (16) which are parallel to the

axis of the hub (12) and bearing the hammers (11).
Machine for trimming according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the pairs (14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) are symmetrical to
one another.
Machine for trimming according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the longitudinal plane of separation of two half-entrance cheeks
(15) of a pair (14) is offset by an angle of 45째 or 90째 relative

to the longitudinal plane of separation of the two half-entrance
cheeks (15) of the preceding pair (14). 
Machine for trimming according to one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the hammers (11) each have the form of an extended body, one of
the ends of which, constituting the head (110), has the form of

a dovetail and the other end of which comprises a boring (111)
with a diameter which is greater than the diameter of the

articulation pins (16) bearing said hammers (11).
Rotor for a trimming machine for slabs (1) which have been
issued from a continuous casting plant and cut to the desired

length by oxygen cutting, said rotor (10) bearing self-retracting
hammers (11) at its periphery and comprising a hub

(12) on which there is fixed at each end an entrance cheek (13)
in the form of a circular ferrule,

characterised in that

the hub (12) comprises between these two entrance cheeks (13)
pairs (14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) which are in the form of

a circular half ferrule and which are adjacent and opposite,
each pair (14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) being spaced at

regular intervals in the longitudinal direction of the hub (12)
and one of the half-entrance cheeks (15) of each pair (14) being

offset in the said longitudinal direction relative to the other
of the half-entrance cheeks (15) of said pair (14) and said

entrance cheeks (13) and said half-entrance cheeks (15)
receiving an assembly of articulation pins (16) which are

parallel to the axis of the hub (12) and bearing the hammers
(11).
Rotor for a trimming machine according to Claim 5,

characterised in that

the pairs (14) of half-entrance cheeks (15) are symmetrical
relative to one another.
Rotor for a trimming machine according to Claim 5,

characterised in that

the longitudinal plane of separation of two half-entrance cheeks
(15) of an identical pair (14) is offset by an angle of 45째 or 

90째 relative to the longitudinal plane of separation of the two
half-entrance cheeks (15) of the preceding pair (14).
