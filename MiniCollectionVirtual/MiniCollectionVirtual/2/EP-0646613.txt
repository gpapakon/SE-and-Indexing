<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a branched polycarbonate which 
comprises using a branching agent containing 200 ppm or less of sulfur; 

a branched polycarbonate which is prepared by the interfacial method 
and contains 1.0 ppm or less of residual sulfur as an impurity; and a 

branched polycarbonate which is prepared by the melting method and 
contains 2.0 ppm or less of residual sulfur as an impurity; are provided. 

When the branched polycarbonate is produced by the interfacial method, 
the branched polycarbonate produced does not show deterioration in heat 

stability or cause mold corrosion. When the branched polycarbonate is 
produced by the melting method, the branched polycarbonate produced 

does not show deterioration in heat stability or in color tone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a branched polycarbonate.
More particularly, the present
invention relates to a process for producing a branched polycarbonate which is excellent in
qualities such as heat stability, resistance to corrosion of molds, color
tone and the like.As the process for producing polycarbonate (hereinafter referred to
as PC), a method of directly bringing an aromatic dihydroxy compound
such as bisphenol A into reaction with phosgen (the interfacial method),
and a method of transesterifying an aromatic dihydroxy compound such
as bisphenol A and a carbonic ester such as diphenylcarbonate in molten
state (the melting method) are generally known. Among PCs obtained by
such methods, linear PCs generally need improvement in molding
properties such as melt elasticity and melt strength. For improving the
molding properties, branching of PC by copolymerization of a
polyfunctional organic compound is proposed, for example, in Japanese
Patent Publications Showa 44(1969)-17149, Showa 47(1972)-23918 and
Showa 60(1985)-11733.Processes for the production of branched polycarbonates are also disclosed in US Re 27682, EP-A-378858 and EP-A-411433.However, when a branched PC is produced by using a
conventional branching agent by the interfacial method, the branched 
PC obtained is inferior in heat stability and, moreover, causes a problem
that molds are corroded. On the other hand, when a branched PC is
produced by using a conventional branching agent by the melting
method, the branched PC obtained is again inferior in heat stability and,
moreover, causes a problem that color tone is inferior.An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a branched PC
having such excellent properties that no deterioration in heat stability is
found and no corrosion of molds is caused when the branched PC is
produced by the interfacial method, and no deterioration in heat stability
is found and no inferior color tone is caused when the branched PC is
produced by the melting method.This object of the present invention
could surprisingly be achieved by decreasing the content of
sulfur in the branching agent used for the production.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for
producing a branched polycarbonate which comprises
a) providing a branching agent containing more than 200 ppm of sulfur and
being selected from
tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, tris(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)methane,
tris(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)methane,
