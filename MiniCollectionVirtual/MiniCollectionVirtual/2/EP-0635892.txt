<ABSTRACT>
A photoresponsive device and a method of 
fabricating same, wherein the device includes 

semiconductor material, such as a cap region (14a), 
comprised of elements selected from Group IIB-VIA. 

A molybdenum contact pad (16) is formed upon a 
surface of the cap region, and a molybdenum ground 

contact pad is formed on a surface of a base region 
(12). A wide bandgap semiconductor passivation 

layer (20) overlies the surface of cap region and 
also partially overlies the molybdenum contact pad. 

A dielectric layer (22) overlies the passivation 
layer, and an indium bump (24) is formed upon the 

molybdenum contact pad. The indium bump extends 

upwardly from the molybdenum contact pad and 
through the dielectric layer. The dielectric layer 

is in intimate contact with side surfaces of the 
indium bump such that no portion of the molybdenum 

contact pad can be physically contacted from a top 
surface of the dielectric layer. The method 

eliminates the possibility of unwanted chemical 
reactions occurring between the In and the 

underlying contact pad metal. The method also 
deposits the contact metal before the deposition of 

the passivation and before a high temperature 
anneal, with windows to the contact being opened 

after the anneal so as to reduce localized stresses 
at the edges of the windows.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radiation
sensors and, in particular, to methods for
fabricating infrared radiation (IR) sensors
comprised of semiconductor materials selected from
Group IIB-VIA of the periodic table.Known types of contact metals used for photovoltaic
(PV) mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) IR sensors
include gold (Au) with a nickel (Ni) overcoat, for
individual p-type contacts, and palladium (Pd) with
a Ni overcoat for n-type ground (common) contacts.
However, during high temperature storage both Au
and Pd are known to diffuse into HgCdTe, causing a
high density of dislocations, in the case of Pd,
and shorting out the p-n junction, in the case of
Au. Both of these unwanted diffusions result in
degraded device performance and poor high
temperature (bake) stability. Furthermore, the use
of Au/Ni contacts for the p-type material and Pd/Ni
for the n-type material requires two separate
photolithographic and deposition processes. Also,
the Au/Ni and Pd/Ni metal systems each have a
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that differs
significantly from the CTE of HgCdTe. As a result, 
stress is applied to the HgCdTe during thermal
cycling.It is also known to employ an annealed, wide
bandgap semiconductor passivation layer comprised
of, by example, cadmium-telluride (CdTe) with the
aforementioned contact metals. In that an
as-deposited CdTe film contains residual crystal
lattice stress, thermal annealing reduces the
stress in the CdTe to approximately 10% of its
as-deposited value. Annealing of the CdTe
passivation is conventionally performed prior to
depositing the contact metallization, and requires
openings, or windows, to be etched through the
passivation film before annealing. However, etching
openings in the passivation film results in
undesirable stress concentrations at the edges of
the openings, thereby degrading the underlying
HgCdTe material.As a result, Dewar bake-out temperatures are
typically limited to 100Â°C or less because of the
instabilities in the surface passivation and/or the
undesired diffusion of contact metal.Furthermore, in that Hg is known to diffuse through
a CdTe passivation layer during high temperature
storage, a desired stoichiometric ratio of Group
IIB-VIA material is not preserved within the
radiation sensor device, over a prolonged period of
high temperature storage. A further problem that arises during the processing
of conventional IR detector arrays relates to two
unwanted chemical reactions that occur during an
etch process that is used to remove oxide
