<ABSTRACT>
A coated paper comprising a paper substrate and a 
pseudo-boehmite layer formed on the substrate, wherein 

said pseudo-boehmite layer has a specular glossiness at 
60Â° of at least 30% as measured in accordance with JIS 

Z8741.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
process for producing a coated paper.In recent years, along with wide spread use of electron
still cameras or computers, technology for hard copies
has rapidly been developed to record the images on
paper sheets or the like. The ultimate goal of such hard
copies is silver halide photography, and especially, it is
an object of the development to bring the color reproduction,
image density, gloss, weather resistance, etc.
as close as those of silver halide photography. For the
recording system of hard copies, not only a method of
directly photographing a display on which an image is
shown by silver halide photography, but also various
systems such as a sublimation type heat transfer system,
an ink jet system and an electrostatic transfer system,
are known. Ink jet system printers have been widely
used in recent years, since full coloring is thereby easy,
and printing noise is little. The ink jet system is designed
to eject ink droplets from nozzles at a high speed to the
recording sheet, and the ink contains a large amount of
a solvent. Therefore, the recording sheet for an ink jet
printer is required to quickly absorb the ink and yet have
an excellent color-forming property. For example, a recording
sheet is known which has a porous layer of alumina
hydrate formed on a substrate (US-A-5,104,730).
Further, when a recording sheet for an ink jet printer is
required to have a gloss, glossy paper having an ink-absorbing
layer of a resin type formed on a substrate,
is also known.In the ink jet recording system, the ink contains a
large amount of a solvent to prevent clogging of the nozzle.
Therefore, there has been a problem that after printing,
the ink-absorbing layer tends to undergo swelling
by the influence of the solvent, and especially in the case
of an ink-absorbing layer of a resin type, glossiness
tends to deteriorate. It is further known in the art, see e.
g. JP-A-59 078 925 to use boehmite crystals in the form
of a sol for surface coating of paper.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
process for producing a coated paper having an excellent ink-absorbing
property, a high color reproduction property and an excellent
surface gloss.Thus, the present invention provides a
process for producing a coated paper
comprising a paper substrate and a pseudo-boehmite
layer formed on the substrate
according to claim 1.The present invention provides a process for
producing a coated paper, which comprises coating a
coating solution of pseudo-boehmite on a smooth die

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a coated paper comprising a paper substrate and a
pseudo-boehmite layer containing a binder formed on the substrate,

wherein the process comprises

(i) coating on a smooth die surface an aqueous coating solution of pseudo-boehmite
containing a binder, wherein the binder is contained in an

amount of from 5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the
solid content of pseudo-boehmite and wherein the total solid

concentration is from 5-30 wt%,
(ii) adjusting the water content of the coated film (water/solid content) to a
level of from 200 to 400 percent,
(iii) closely contacting a paper substrate thereon, followed by
(iv) drying to form a pseudo-boehmite layer, and then
when the water content in the pseudo-boehmite layer

becomes not more than 5 wt.%,
(v) peeling off the paper substrate from the die so that the pseudo-boehmite
layer is transferred onto the paper substrate.
The process for producing a coated paper according to claim 1, wherein

in step (iii) the paper substrate has a silica-coated layer, and the
substrate is closely contacted so that the silica-coated layer side is

brought in contact with the coating solution of pseudo-boehmite coated
on the die surface whereby a coated paper is formed which has a porous

layer of silica beneath the pseudo-boehmite layer.
