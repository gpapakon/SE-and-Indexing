<ABSTRACT>
A structure of a piezoelectric resonator housed 
within a package (20), the resonator having an ultrathin 

vibratory portion (216) formed by a cavity (215) made in 
one side of a piezoelectric block (200) substantially 

centrally thereof and a thick frame-like rib (217) formed 
integrally with and surrounding the vibrating portion, 

wherein the resonator has on one face a partial electrode 
(206), an electrode lead pattern (231) extending from the 

partial electrode and an electrode lead end pad (234), the 
pad being located on a marginal portion of the rib, and the 

resonator being attached to the package at the same 
marginal portion but at its opposite face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure by which 
a resonator using an ultrathin piezoelectric plate, capable 
of providing resonance frequencies as high as tens to 
hundreds of megahertz, is supported in a package. In recent years there has been a strong and growing 
demand for high frequency operation and high frequency 
stability of various pieces of electronic and communication 
equipment. An ordinary AT cut quartz crystal resonator, 
which has heretofore been used widely as a piezoelectric 
device (such as a resonator or filter), has a very 
excellent temperature-frequency characteristic. However, 
since its resonance frequency is in inverse proportion to 
its thickness, the fundamental frequency of this kind of 
resonator with a mechanical strength sufficient for 
practical use is around 40 MHz at the highest. There has also been widely employed what is called 
overtone oscillation means which extracts a higher order 
harmonic mode vibration of an AT cut quartz crystal 
resonator to obtain a frequency which is an odd multiple of 
the fundamental resonance frequency, but its oscillation 
circuit calls for an LC tuning circuit including a coil, 
and hence is not suitable for fabrication as a 
semiconductor IC, besides the overtone oscillation circuit 
may sometimes be difficult to activate because such a 
resonator has a large capacitance ratio and consequently a 
high impedance level. On the other hand, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) 
resonator, whose oscillation frequency is determined by the 
pitch of electrodes of an interdigital transducer, has come 
to be able to output a maximum of 1 GHz or so due to the 
progress in photolithography, but a piezoelectric substrate 
usable for the SAW resonator is remarkably inferior to the 
AT cut quartz crystal in terms of temperature-frequency 
characteristic.  To solve the above-mentioned problems, there has been 
proposed in house, but not disclosed publicly, a 
piezoelectric resonator such as shown in Figs. 6(a), 6(b), 
7(a) and 7(b). That is, a cavity or recess 5 is formed, by machining 
or etching, in one side of a block 1 of AT cut quartz 
crystal substantially centrally thereof as depicted in 
Figs. 6(a) and (b) and the thickness of a vibratory portion 
2 forming the bottom of the cavity 5 is selected about 
16Âµm, for example, if a fundamental resonance frequency of 
100 MHz is desired. On the side of the block where the cavity 5 is formed, 
the ultrathin vibratory portion 2 is edged with a thick 
frame-like marginal rib portion 3 formed

A structure of a piezoelectric resonator housed within 
a package (20), the resonator having an ultrathin vibratory 

portion (216) formed by a cavity (215) made in one side of 
a piezoelectric block (200) substantially centrally thereof 

and a thick frame-like rib (217) formed integrally with and 
surrounding the vibrating portion, wherein the resonator

lead pattern (231) extending from the partial electrode and 

an electrode lead end pad (234), the pad being located on 
a marginal portion of the rib, and the resonator being 

attached to the package at the same marginal portion but at 
its opposite face. 
A structure according to claim 1, wherein the 
resonator has an excess adhesive receiving groove or slit 

(40) cut in the marginal portion of the frame-like rib 
along one side of the cavity between an adhesive coated 

region (3a) at which the resonator is attached to the 
package and the edge of the cavity for preventing the 

adhesive from flowing into the cavity from the adhesive 
coated region. 
A structure according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the piezoelectric block (1) is made of AT cut quartz 

crystal and wherein an elongate adhesive coated region (15) 
on the marginal portion of the frame-like rib extends along 

the z-axis direction of the crystal.
