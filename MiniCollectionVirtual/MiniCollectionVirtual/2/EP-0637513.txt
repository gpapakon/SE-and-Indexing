<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure- and heat-sensitive
multilayer copying paper.A colorless heat-sensitive transfer recording paper
having pressure-sensitivity composed of a substrate sheet, a
heat-sensitive recording layer provided on a front surface
of the substrate sheet, and a layer provided on a back
surface of the substrate sheet consisting of a microcapsuled
electron donative colorless color-former, an electron
acceptive developer which develops with the color-former,
the solid color-former and developer and waxes is known to
the art (Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 168690/1985).
However, in the recording papers of this class, since the
layer provided on a back surface of the substrate sheet
contains both a color-former and a developer, even if weak
handling pressure is applied to the material, the
microcapsule may easily rupture, and pollution due to color
development may be formed. Furthermore, since a number of
compositions have to be provided onto the same substrate
sheet, a coating amount becomes relatively large,
susceptibility to pressure and heat is remarkably reduced, 
and good recording and copy typing may not be obtained.To overcome the problems, a pressure- and heat-sensitive
multilayer copying paper comprising a combination
of: an upper paper member composed of a substrate, a heat-sensitive
layer provided on a front surface of the substrate,
and a transfer layer provided on a back surface of the
substrate comprising a colorless color-former, a
microcapsuled color-former and a thermomeltable material;
and a lower paper member having an image receiving layer
thereon (Japanese Kokai Patent Publication No. 90282/1987)
is proposed. For using the pressure- and heat-sensitive
multilayer copying paper, the upper paper member is stacked
on the lower paper member, and heat is applied onto a
surface thereof by the use of, for example, a thermal head,
and thereby, thermal print may be obtained on the heat-sensitive
layer provided on a surface of the upper paper
member, as well as a thermomeltable material of the
pressure- and heat-sensitive transfer layer is melted and
transferred to the lower paper due to thus applied heat
energy, and the thermomeltable material co-melts with a
developer provided on a front surface of the lower paper
member to form heat duplicated print. When no pressure is
applied, only heat duplicated print is formed, but when
pressure is applied simultaneously or independently, a
microcapsule provided on the back surface is broken due to
applied pressure, a
