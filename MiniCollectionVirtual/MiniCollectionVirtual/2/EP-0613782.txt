<ABSTRACT>
Described is a drive control device for a thermal printer 
supplying drive pulse signals to heating elements (1a) provided 

in the print head (1) of the thermal printer, the energy 
of the drive pulse signals being controlled in response 

to the temperature of the print head (1). A temperature 
detection means detects the temperature of the print head and 

outputs an analog signal (Vt) which is converted into a 
digital standard value by an A/D converter (15a). Based on 

prestored relationships, current flow intervals are 
determined from the respective standard value. Current flow 

pulse signals corresponding to the current flow intervals are 
generated and combined with drive data indicating the active 

or inactive state for the heating elements to obtain the 
drive pulse signals. In case of a so-called historical 

control the current flow intervals are combined with the 
drive data of a present print cycle and previous print cycles 

so as to drive the heating elements based on the drive 
history.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal printers, and, more specifically,
to a drive control device used for driving the
thermal print head of such printers.The print head of a thermal printer contains a heating element,
in case of a dot matrix print head, one heating element
for each dot. The heating element or selected ones of the
heating elements are supplied with drive pulses to generate
heat in order to form a visible print-out, for instance by
means of thermal paper. A variety of methods has been
utilized in order to prevent a reduction in printing quality
due to the accumulation of heat during continuous operation
of the print head. Among the methods being employed are the
method of memorizing the previous drive data for each dot of
a dot matrix print head and determining the width or current
flow time of the drive pulses dependent on such previous
drive data, as disclosed JP-A-55-48631, and the method of
changing the current flow time by means of drive cycles, as
disclosed in JP-A-57-18507. These methods are generally
called historical control methods.In addition, the documents JP-B-61-130063 and JP-B-59-7068
can be given as examples of measuring the base material
temperature of the print head using thermistors and A/D
converters.In these known printers, complicated calculations take place
using the detected output values of an A/D converter to
determine such things as the pulse width and the voltage of
the drive pulses to be applied to the heating elements. In addition, with the historical control method, which varies
the drive pulse width based on historical drive data, the
general method has been that of sending data sequentially to
a print head drive IC while generally processing data by
means of the CPU. Using such a method, even if an attempt was
made to operate the thermal printer at high speed, the
processing could not keep up, and this became an obstruction
to increasing the speed of the thermal printer.Fig. 1 depicts a linearized thermistor temperature detection
circuit and the A/D converter connections according to the
state of art.In general, resistor 121 is connected in parallel and resistor
122 is connected in series to thermistor 120 to form a
voltage divider circuit 125, which is a linearized circuit.
The voltage potential Vp of voltage division point 123 of
voltage divider circuit 125 is input to detection pin 115 of
an A/D converter 110. The A/D converter will output this
electric potential in a binary code form and the CPU will
read this and perform arithmetic processing. 112
