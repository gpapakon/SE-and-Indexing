<ABSTRACT>
A tray for carrying a plurality of plant pots includes 
a base plate (2) and a plurality of container sections (6). The 

container sections (6) are provided in the base plate (2) for 
receiving pots therein. Each of the container sections (6) has 

an open top end (3), a peripheral wall (4) and a bottom wall (5). 
Retainer members (8) are disposed on the peripheral wall (4) of each 

of the container sections (6) and are operable to resiliently 
apply pressing forces to the side wall of a pot received 

within the container section (6) so as to fixedly hold the pot 
in position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tray for carrying a 
plurality of plant pots. A conventional tray for carrying a plurality of plant pots, 
as described in NL-A 8702257, includes a base plate and a 
plurality of container sections formed therein. Each of the 
container sections includes an opening formed in the base 
plate and having a suitable configuration, a plurality of 
support members extending downwardly from the peripheral 
portion of the opening, and a bottom plate connected to the 
lower ends of the support members. The tray is made of 
foamed synthetic material. Stiffening ribs are arranged at 
the walls of the support members. However, with this conventional tray, the container sections 
can receive only a few kinds of pots having approximately 
a size or configuration conforming to the container 
sections, because the stiffening ribs are only insignificantly 
plasticly deformable. Thus, pots having a larger 
size than the container sections cannot be sufficiently 
received by the container sections, while pots having a 
smaller size than the container sections tend  
 
to move within the container sections during transportation. 
In any cases, an operation for transporting pots cannot be 
satisfactorily performed. Therefore, it is necessary to 
prepare a number of kinds of trays having container sections 
of different sizes and configurations so as to cope with 
various kinds of pots. Such preparation of number of kinds 
of trays is unpractical. It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention 
to provide a tray which is adapted for carrying a plurality 
of plant pots and which includes container sections 
effective to conveniently receive various kinds of pots 
having different sizes or configurations. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
tray for carrying a plurality of plant pots, comprising: 
a base plate; a plurality of container sections provided in the base 
plate for receiving pots therein, each of the container 
sections having an open top end, a peripheral wall and a 
bottom wall; and retainer members disposed on the peripheral wall of 
each of the container sections and operable to resiliently 
apply pressing forces to the side wall of a pot received  
 
within the container section so as to fixedly hold the pot 
in position. The invention will become more apparent from the 
appended claims and the description as it proceeds in 
connection with the drawings. FIG. 1 is a plan view of a tray for carrying a 
plurality of plant pots according to an

<CLAIMS>
A tray (1) for carrying a plurality of plant pots, 
comprising: 


a base plate (2) and 
a plurality of container sections (6) provided in said 
base plate (2) for receiving pots therein, each of said 

container sections having an open top end, a peripheral 
wall (4) and a bottom wall (5), 
characterised in that
 
retainer members (8) are disposed on said peripheral 

wall (4) of each of said container sections (6) and 
are operable to resiliently apply a pressing force 

to the side wall of a pot received within said container 
section so as to fixedly hold the pot in position.  

 
The tray as defined in claim 1 wherein:
 
   said retainer means includes a plurality of retainer 

members (8) disposed on said peripheral wall (4) and spaced from 
each other in a direction circumferentially of said 

peripheral wall (4); and
 
   each of said retainer members (8) resiliently deform in a 

direction away from the center of the corresponding 
container section (6) through abutment on the side wall of the 

pot when the pot is inserted into said container section.  
 
The tray as defined in claim 1 wherein said retainer 
members (8) are formed integrally with said peripheral wall (4). 
The tray as defined in claim 2 wherein said container 
sections (6) including said peripheral wall (4) are formed 

integrally with said base plate (2). 
The tray as defined in claim 4 wherein:
 
   each of said retainer members (8) includes an upper portion 

connected to said base plate (2) and a lower portion connected 
to said peripheral wall at a position adjacent said bottom 

wall (5);
 
   each of said retainer members (8) has both lateral sides 

separated from said peripheral wall (4) by slits (7); and
 
   said upper portion has at least one bent part which 

serves to provide resiliency to the corresponding retainer 
member. 
The tray as defined in claim 5 wherein said at least 
one bent part includes a first bent part (9) having a 

configuration turned upwardly and a second bent part (10) having 
a configuration turned downwardly and connected to said base 

plate (2).
