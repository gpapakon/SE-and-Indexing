<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns nucleic acids and
polypeptides coded by said nucleic acids, derived from
protozoan parasites of Cryptosporidium genus. Nucleic
acids and peptides are advantageously used for
developing detection assays of Cryptosporidium in
biological samples of human and animal origin and/or in
the environment.Cryptosporidium parasites infect the intestinal
tract of several animal species. Over the last decade
the number of infections in humans has dramatically
increased. Most of the affected patients show a marked
immunodeficiency, with a high incidence of AIDS. The
immunocompromised patients develop a severe and
frequently irreversible diarrhoea which causes
malnutrition and represents a major factor leading to
death.The prophylaxis of Cryptospcridium infections
is hampered by the lack of reliable immunoassays for
the detection of the parasite. Moreover, by microscopic
examination, parasite oocyst are difficult to
discriminate from several microoganisms that are
morphologically similar to Cryptosporidium, like
Candida species.The development of immunological and molecular
diagnostic assays highly specific for Cryptosporidium
absolutely requires the biochemical characterisation
and localization of parasite antigens and the cloning
of corresponding genes. The availability of diagnostic
assays would permit to develop prophylactic measures
for immunodeficient patients by detecting the parasites 
in the environment (food, water) and in individuals
(relatives, nurses) that may act as carriers.Moreover, no effective therapeutic compounds
against Cryptosporidium infection are available;
therefore there is the need to develop reagents able to
prevent the onset of the infection in immunodeficient
patients.The authors of the present invention have
obtained a rabbit antiserum raised against a whole
lysate of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The serum has been
used to screen a genomic library of Cryptosporidium
from infected intestinal mucosal cells, into the
expression vector Î»gt11. Among clones isolated, clone
cpRL3 has been shown to comprise a 2359 bp (SEQ ID
No.1) insert with an open reading frame coding for a
polypeptide of 786 amino acids (SEQ ID No.2). Scanning
of the 67.0 version of the "GENE BANK" data base using
the cpRL3 sequence failed to reveal any similarity with
known DNA sequences.The cpRL3 insert has been subcloned into an
expression plasmid and the corresponding recombinant
polypeptide is produced in E. coli, fused at the
N-terminus to a stretch of six histidines. The
histidine sequence allows a
