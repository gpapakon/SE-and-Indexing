<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyester base for photographic
films and to photographic films in which the polyester base combines
the curl extinguishing properties of cellulose triacetate film with
favourable mechanical properties.In photographic materials a photosensitive composition, e.g. a
silver halide emulsion, is adhered to a support. Depending on the
use of the photographic material the support may be opaque (e.g.
paper) or transparent (e.g. glass or a polymeric transparent film).When a transparent support is used it is preferred to use a
polymeric film, the most widely used polymeric film substrates for
photographic materials being cellulose triacetate (CTA) and
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The main advantages of cellulose
triacetate are the optical isotropy, high transparency and the
ability to eliminate curl during processing. Due to this last
property CTA is mainly used in the production of roll-film. When a
photographic film is rolled around a core in a film cartridge and
remains rolled for a fairly long time, the film tends to get curl.
This curl has to be diminished and even eliminated for flawless
operation of the roll-film material in the printing step subsequent
to the development. When after processing the curl is not
eliminated, the film can jam during the printing step, can be
scratched etc. Also for easy storage the negatives of a roll-film
should be as flat as possible. In CTA the residual curl is easily
eliminated during processing, and automatic printing of the films
can proceed flawlessly.The dimensional stability and the mechanical strenght of
cellulose triacetate film however are fairly low, therefore the use
of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film as a support for
photographic materials is widely spread. In recording materials for
diagnostic imaging e.g., where the films are automatically
transported in daylight systems, film-changers, processors etc, the
support of the films is almost exclusively a polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) film. Also in the graphic arts where 
dimensional stability of the films is of utmost importance PET-film
is used as the support for the light sensitive material.For roll-film however, the use of PET-film poses the problem of
curl-extinguishing. Contrary to the curl (due to core-setting) of
cellulose triacetate film, the curl of a PET-film is not eliminated
during the processing.For use as a support in roll-film, it is-highly desirable to
have a support that combines the benefits of CTA-film with the
strenghts of PET-film and dispenses from
