<ABSTRACT>
Planar display devices which have a small thickness and 
used as a display unit of a television set, a monitor or the 

like. 
A control electrode portion for passing electrons 
through a given electron-passing hole selected from a 

plurality of electron-passing holes provided on an insulating 
substrate is formed by coating the insulating substrate 

with a conductive film and dividing them into a plurality of 
conductive films as control electrodes. 
This structure obviates the mesh structure of electrons 
which are necessary in the case of arranging control electrodes 

on the insulating substrate, thereby realizing 
high-definition display devices with improved luminance. In 

addition, planar display devices provided with a surface 
insulated substrate produced by forming an insulating film 

on a conductive substrate having electron-passing holes and 
a plurality of separate control electrodes arranged on the 

surface insulated substrate, it is possible to prevent the 
charge-up effect which obstructs the passage of electron 

beams and, hence, to enhance the luminance by (1) providing 
a voltage applying means for applying a predetermined 

voltage to the conductive substrate, (2) providing a portion 
at which the conductive substrate is exposed between the 

adjacent control electrodes, and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar 
display apparatus utilising an electron beam. Figure 15 of the accompanying drawings is a 
perspective view of a part of a conventional planar 
display apparatus described in, for example, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No 184239/1988. Similar devices are 
described in DE-A-2 742 555 EP-A-0 107 217 and JP-A-58-046562. The 
precharacterising portion of claim 1 is based on this 
prior art which will be described below. In Figure 15, the reference numeral 1 represents 
a linear hot cathode as an electron radiation source which 
emits electrons when conduction is established, the linear 
hot cathode 1 being connected to a holder (not shown). 
The reference numeral 2 denotes a mesh electrode having an 
oval cross-section and a multiplicity of small holes 3 for 
passing electrons therethrough. By applying an 
appropriate potential to the mesh electrode 2, electrons 
are taken out of the linear hot cathode 1. The reference 
numeral 4 represents a front glass (display screen) with 
the inside surface coated with dot-like three kinds of 
phosphor materials 5 which emit red, green and blue light 
when excited by the electrons drawn out by the mesh 
electrode 2. On the fluorescent substances 5, an 
aluminium film (not shown) is provided for imparting 
conductivity. By applying a voltage of about 10 to 30 KV 
to the aluminium film, the electrons are accelerated and 
excite the fluorescent substances 5 so as to emit light.  
 The referential numeral 6 represents a control 
electrode portion disposed between the front glass 4 and the 
linear hot cathode 1 in close proximity thereto so as to 
allow or obstruct the passage of the electrons which are 
taken out by the mesh electrode 3 and directed 
toward the front glass 4. As shown in the exploded view of 
the structure of the control electrode portion 6 in Fig. 16, 
the control electrode portion 6 is composed of an insulating 
substrate 8 having electron-passing holes 7 which correspond 
to the picture elements on the front glass 4, a first control 
electrode group 9 provided on the undersurface of the 
insulating substrate 8 and a second control electrode group 
10 provided on the upper surface of the insulating substrate 
8. The first control electrode group 9 is composed of a 
plurality of strip metal electrodes 9a. The metal electrode 
9a is provided with electron passing portions 9b which 
correspond to the respective picture elements in one row. 
Similarly, the second control electrode group 10 is composed 
of a plurality
