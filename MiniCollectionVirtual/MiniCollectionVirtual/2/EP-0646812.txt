<ABSTRACT>
A first optical waveguide chip has a ceramic 
substrate (12) and a cover (22), and the ceramic 

substrate has a V groove (14) and guide grooves (20) 
with an optical fiber (16) being fixed in the V groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical component, 
and more particularly to an optical transmission/reception 
module for use in optical CATV and optical 
communication fields. As the optical fiber transmission technology advances, 
various research activities are directed to optical 
CATV and optical communication systems which utilize the 
wide-band characteristics of the optical fibers. It is expected 
that there will be realized a Fiber-To-The-Home 
(FTTH) system which has optical fibers led to homes for 
starting various information services in the near future. 
For realizing a full-fledged FTTH system, it is necessary to 
reduce the size and cost of optical terminals connected to 
respective homes. The FTTH system requires a bidirectional optical 
transmission mode which needs to be performed by an optical 
reception/transmission module comprising a light source for 
emitting an optical signal, a light-detecting element for 
converting the optical signal into an electric signal, and 
an optical coupler for transmitting light from the optical 
source and light to the light-detecting element to optical 
fibers that are used to transmit light.  FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically 
shows a conventional optical reception/transmission module 
500. As shown in FIG. 1, the optical reception/transmission 
module 500 comprises a laser diode 562, a photodiode 564, 
and an optical coupler 510. The optical coupler 510 
comprises two optical fibers 512, 514 fused together. 
Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the length of the 
optical coupler 510. The optical coupler 510 and the laser 
diode 562, and the optical coupler 510 and the photodiode 
564 are connected to each other by optical fibers through 
fused regions 520 thereof. Consequently, the optical 
reception/transmission module 500 is relatively long in its 
entirety. If a plurality of optical reception/transmission 
modules 500 are required, then since the individual optical 
reception/transmission modules 500 have to be arrayed 
horizontally or vertically, the space taken up by the 
optical reception/transmission modules 500 increases and the 
cost of the entire system also increases as the number of 
optical reception/transmission modules 500 increases. As described above, inasmuch as the optical 
coupler 510 is composed of the two optical fibers 512, 514 
fused together and the optical reception/transmission module 
500 is made up of three components, i.e., the laser diode 
562, the photodiode 564, and the optical coupler 510, the
