<ABSTRACT>
To be able to produce, by means of a building or construction material, shaped bodies or construction elements having greatly improved strength, it is proposed to provide the material with a very substantially uniformly distributed very fine pore structure or a microcellular structure. The very fine pores here preferably have a diameter in the range from about 0.01  mu m to about 5  mu m and are closed in themselves. The material here comprises a reactive binder or a reactive matrix material which can be, for example, a cement/water mixture or else a synthetic resin such as polyurethane, epoxy resin and the like.
