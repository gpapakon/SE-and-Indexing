<ABSTRACT>
A connecting terminal, for example for service apparatuses such as line protection circuit breakers, in the case of which a terminal screw (3) is guided in a frame-like terminal body (1) in a side wall (2) of the terminal body, which terminal screw (3) acts in a clamping manner against an opposite side wall (4), a pressure piece (5) being arranged at a variable height in an imaginary connecting plane. It is provided that a bracket (6) composed of electrically highly conductive material is guided from the pressure piece (5) (by the pressure piece) alongside walls of the terminal body 1 to a connecting plane in which is merges into a connecting conductor.

<CLAIMS>
Connecting terminal, for example for installation equipment such as circuit 
breakers, in which in a frame-like clamping part (1) a clamping screw (3) is guided 

in one side wall (2) and acts clampingly against an opposed side wall (4), wherein 
a pressure member (5) is disposed in a notional attachment plane and a bow (6) 

made of material of good electrical conductivity runs from the pressure member (5) 
alongside walls of the clamping part (1) to a connector plane,
 
characterised in that
 
on the lead-attachment side the bow (6) runs upwards on end to the connector 

plane, where it turns into a region (8) of the bow which stands on edge and runs at 
least part way round the clamping part (1) and which on the connector side turns 

into a connector strip (7). 
Connecting terminal according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the region (8) of the bow which stands on edge is shaped like a cuff which 

embraces the clamping part (1) and has the connector strip (7) attached to it. 
Connecting terminal according to claim 1 or claim 2, designed as a 
connecting terminal for contact breakers,
 
characterised in that
 
the connector strip (7) changes into an arc guide (9) for an arc splitter stack.
