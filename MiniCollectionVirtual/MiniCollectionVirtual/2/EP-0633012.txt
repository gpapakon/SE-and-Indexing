<ABSTRACT>
The nozzle body and inserting element have opposite faces (22,40), between which the outlet aperture is formed. The inserting element has an outer thread engaging the inner thread (30) of the nozzle body. This enables an axial motion of the inserting element in the direction of the longitudinal axis (48) of the nozzle body to change the gap width of the aperture. Pref. the inner thread lies in an axial through bore (26) of the nozzle body.

Nozzle for a tub (10), in particular a whirlpool tub, including a nozzle body (2)
insertable into a cutout in the tub (10) and connectable thereto, and an insert

element (4) which is screwable by an external thread (32) into an internal thread (30)
of the nozzle body (2) and arranged to be axially moveable in the direction of the

longitudinal axis (48) of the nozzle body (2) and further includes a blind hole (50)
with radial apertures (56), the nozzle body (2) and the insert element (4) having

mutually opposite surfaces (22, 40) between which an outlet opening (20) for a
medium, in particular air, capable of flowing into the tub (10) is provided, and the gap

width of the outlet opening (20) being variable by axial movement of the insert
element (4),
characterized in that
 an annular gap (44), the width of which decreases in the
direction of the annular outlet opening (20), is present between the inner surface (22)

of the nozzle body (2) and the substantially conical opposite outer surface (40) of the
insert element (4),
in that
 the inner surface (22), which is of a design which tapers from the outlet
opening (20) inwards towards the longitudinal axis (48), adjoins the internal thread

(30),
in that
 the insert element (4) has at its outer side, in the region of the radial
apertures, a recess (54) in which the said outer surface (40) of the insert element (4)

ends, with the substantially conical outer surface (40) having an opening angle (42)
which is between 60° and 120°,

and 
in that
 the insert element (4) has, in the region of its upper surface (34) assigned
to the interior space of the tub, a diameter (36) which is equal to or less than the

diameter of the outlet edge (18) of the outlet opening (20).
Nozzle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the internal thread (30) is
arranged in a through hole (26) of the nozzle body (2), the through hole (26) being

adjoined by the inner surface (22) opening into the interior of the tub.
Nozzle according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the thickness (62) of
the insert element (4) in the region of the radial apertures (56) is substantially smaller 

than the wall thickness (60) in the region of the external thread (32) of the insert

element (4).
Nozzle according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the thickness (62) in the
region of the radial apertures (56) is less than half the wall thickness (60) in the

region of the external thread (32).
Nozzle according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the recess (54)
is designed as an annular groove.
Nozzle according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the inner
surface (22) of the nozzle body (2) is of substantially conical design, to be precise

with a first opening angle (24) which is preferably between 40° and 100°, expediently
between 60° and 80°.
Nozzle according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the opening
angle (42) of the outer surface (40) of the insert element (4) is between 80° and

100°.
Nozzle according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the in
particular plane upper surface (34) of the insert element (4) lies substantially in the

same radial plane as the outlet edge (18) of the outlet opening (20) and/or of the
inner surface (22).
Nozzle according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the insert
element (4) has through holes (68) which run from its upper surface (34), assigned to

the interior space of the tub, as far as the said blind hole (50) and the diameter of
which is substantially smaller than the diameter of the blind hole (50).
