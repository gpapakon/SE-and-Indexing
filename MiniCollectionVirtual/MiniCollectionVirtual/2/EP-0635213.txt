<CLAIMS>
A tubular cellulose-based food casing having a
coated inner side for improved peelability, which

comprises the internal coating containing 450 to 800
mg/m
2
 of lecithin, 30 to 300 mg/m
2
 of
poly(tetrafluoroethylene).
The food casing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
casing is a sausage casing.
The food casing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
internal coating additionally contains up to

500 mg/m
2
, preferably 100 to 500 mg/m
2
, of an oil.
The food casing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
internal coating is sprayed on.
The food casing as claimed in claim 3, wherein the
oil is a silicone oil.
An aqueous, lecithin-containing coating solution for
the impregnation of a cellulose-based food casing,

which comprises the solution additionally containing
poly(tetrafluoroethylene).
The coating solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein
the coating solution is sprayable and contains 2 to

15 % by weight, preferably 5 to 12 % by weight of
lecithin, and 0.5 to 6 % by weight, preferably 1 to

3 % by weight, each based on the total weight of the
solution, of poly(tetrafluoroethylene).
The coating solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein
the coating solution contains up to 8 % by weight,

preferably 0.5 to 6 % by weight, particularly 
preferably 2 to 5 % by weight, each based on the

total weight of the solution, of oils.
The coating solution as claimed in claim 8, wherein
the oil is a silicone oil.
The coating solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein
the coating solution contains up to 3 % by weight,

preferably 0.2 to 3 % by weight, based on the total
weight of the solution, of a wheat protein.
The coating solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein
the viscosity of the spray solution is between 20

and 200 mPa·s (cP), preferably between 140 and 180
mPa·s (cP).
The coating solution as claimed in claim 6, wherein
cup to 50 % of the water, preferably 20 to 50 %, is

replaced by propane-1,2-diol.
