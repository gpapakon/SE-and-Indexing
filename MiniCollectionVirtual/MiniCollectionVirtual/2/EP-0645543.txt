<ABSTRACT>
A cooling system (20) for use with an 
internal combustion engine (24) is disclosed, the 

cooling system (20) including a fan 
(26) defining a central axis, a radiator 

(30) asymmetrical in shape about the central 
axis, and a fan shroud (34) disposed 

about the fan (26) and defining a flow path 
for directing cooling flow across the radiator 

(30). The fan shroud (34) 
includes a radially converging inlet portion 

(40), a radially diverging outlet portion 
(44) and a cylindrical transition portion 

(42) therebetween. The radially converging 
inlet portion (40) and the radially diverging 

outlet portion (44) are axisymmetrical in shape 
about the central axis and are substantially 

symmetric with one another about an imaginary plane 
(49) constructed normal to the central axis. The 

geometry of the fan shroud (34), the 
alignment of the fan shroud (34) relative 

to the fan (26), and the fan spacing relative 
to the radiator (30) are determined according 

to dimensionless numbers relating the various 
geometries to the fan diameter and the projected axial 

fan chord.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a low 
noise fan and shroud arrangement for use with an 
engine cooling system. One dominant source of engine noise is the 
noise emitted by its cooling system. Such noise is a 
function of a variety of factors, including the type 
and position of the fan, the design of the fan shroud, 
and the type, size and position of the radiator core. One example of a noise suppressing fan 
shroud is the fan shroud entrance structure disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 3,903,960 to Beck et al. The fan 
of U.S. Patent No. 3,903,960 is typical of other prior 
art fan structures in that it immediately tapers 
between a circular shape corresponding to that of the 
cylindrical discharge throat section and a rectangular 
shape corresponding to that of the radiator. As a 
result of such an asymmetrical discharge, separation 
and turbulence of cooling flow exiting the cylindrical 
discharge throat section, and its associated noise, is 
produced. Another example of a noise suppressing fan 
shroud is shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,024,267 to 
Yamaguchi et al. which discloses a fan shroud having a 
box-shaped main body covering one of the surfaces of a 
heat exchanger and a cylindrical portion penetrating 
through the main body. A fan is disposed in the 
cylindrical portion and extends partially into the 
box-shaped main body. The main body includes an  
 
enlarged portion disposed adjacent to and 
corresponding to the protruding portion of the 
cylindrical portion to create a high static pressure 
region between the fan and radiator in an attempt to 
increase axial flow and reduce noise. However, 
without a physical structure guiding discharge flow 
from the fan, some recirculation and turbulence, and 
its associated noise, at the fan discharge is still 
likely to occur as a result of the influence of the 
asymmetrical box-shaped main body. U.S. Patent No. 3,872,916 to Beck discloses 
a radially diverging shroud exit section which 
immediately tapers between a circular shape 
corresponding to that of the cylindrical discharge 
throat section and a rectangular shape corresponding 
to that of the radiator. As a result of such an 
asymmetrical inlet, inlet distortion and downstream 
turbulence of cooling flow through the fan is 
produced. A need therefore exists for an engine 
cooling system having reduced operating noise levels. 
Such a cooling system should be adaptable to both 
blower-type and suction-type fan arrangements as well 
as axial flow and mixed flow fans. Preferably, such a 
cooling
