<ABSTRACT>
A wireless communication network system includes a 
communication controller, and a plurality of terminal devices which 

can communicate with the communication controller by wireless. 
The communication controller includes a first section for detecting 

absence of a received signal from any of the terminal devices, and a 
second section responsive to an output signal of the first section for 

periodically generating a nonbusy signal, which can be 
discriminated from another signal transmitted from the 

communication controller, in the absence of the received signal. 
Each of the terminal devices includes a third section for detecting 

the nonbusy signal, and a fourth section responsive to an output 
signal of the third section for permitting transmission from the 

terminal device after the nonbusy signal is received by the third 
section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wireless communication network 
system such as a wireless LAN (local area network) system which 
has a host device (a central device) and a plurality of terminal 
devices which can communicate with the host device without 
wires, for example by radio or light signals. It should be understood herein that reference to "optical" and 
"light" include infrared and ultraviolet radiation as well as 
visible light. A general wireless LAN system of the CSMA (carrier sense 
multiple access) type has a central controller (a host device) and a 
plurality of terminal devices which can communicate with the 
central controller by wireless. Generally, each of the terminal 
devices is designed to provide the following function. In cases 
where the terminal device is required to transmit a signal toward 
the central controller, the terminal device detects whether or not a 
signal from the central controller is currently received. The 
terminal device executes signal transmission when a signal from the 
central controller is detected to be currently absent. Otherwise, the 
terminal device does not execute signal transmission. In the wireless LAN system, when two different terminal 
devices simultaneously transmit signals toward the central 
controller, the transmitted signals tend to interfere with each  
 
other. The signal interference causes a failure in communication 
among the terminal devices and the central controller. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
wireless communication network system. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved 
terminal device for use in a wireless communication network 
system. A first aspect of this invention provides a wireless 
communication network system comprising a communication 
controller; and a plurality of terminal devices which can 
communicate with the communication controller by wireless; 
wherein the communication controller comprises first means for 
detecting absence of a received signal from any of the terminal 
devices, and second means responsive to an output signal of the first 
means for periodically generating a nonbusy signal, which can be 
discriminated from another signal transmitted from the 
communication controller, in the absence of the received signal; 
wherein each of the terminal devices comprises third means for 
detecting the nonbusy signal, and fourth means responsive to an 
output signal of the third means for permitting transmission from 
the terminal device after the nonbusy signal
