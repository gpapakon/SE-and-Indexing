A multiplier (M) for real or complex numbers comprising 
a multiplying device (mp) for forming partial 

products from a first 2m-digit number (Z1) and a second 
2m-digit number (Z2) which are fed to the multiplier 

through a first data input (D1) and a second data input 
(D2), respectively, and whose product is provided as a 

third number (Z3) at a 4m-digit data output (D3), where 
m is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the first 

data input (D1) being divided into an m-digit first 
digit range (S1) and an m-digit second digit range (S2), 

and the second data input (D2) being divided into an m-digit 
third digit range (S3) and an m-digit fourth digit 

range (S4),
characterized by the following features:
The partial products of the second and fourth digit 
ranges (S2, S4) form a first subfield (T1), the partial 

products of the first and third digit ranges (S1, S3) 
form a second subfield (T2), the partial products of the 

second and third digit ranges (S2, S3) form a third subfield 
(T3), and the partial products of the first and 

fourth digit ranges (S1, S4) form a fourth subfield 
(T4); 
a controller (st) switches the multiplier (M) selectively 
from real-number multiplication (R) to complex-number 

multiplication (K), which forms from a first  
 

complex number (K1) and a second complex number (K2) a 
third complex number (K3); 
in case of a real-number multiplication (R), the first 
and third digit ranges (S1, S3) are fed with the digits 

1 to m of the first or second number (Z1, Z2), and the 
second and fourth digit ranges (S2, S4) are fed with digits 

m+1 to 2m of the first or second number (Z1, Z2); 
in case of a complex-number multiplication (K), the 
first and third digit ranges (S1, S3) are fed with m 

imaginary-number digits (I1, I2) of the first or second 
complex number (K1, K2), and the second and fourth digit 

ranges (S2, S4) are fed with m real-number digits 
(R1, R2) of the first or second complex number (K1, K2); 
in case of a real-number multiplication (R), the controller 
(st), by means of a first digit assignment, 

causes a first basic weight (g1) to be assigned to the 
first subfield (T1), a second basic weight (g2) to be 

assigned to the third and fourth subfields (T3, T4), and 
a third basic weight (g3) to be assigned to the second 

subfield (T2), and the addition of the partial products 
of the first, second, third, and fourth subfields (T1 to 

T4) to be performed in a positionally correct manner in 
accordance with a resulting weight (g) of the individual 

partial products to provide the 4m digits of the third 
number (Z3), and 
in case of a complex-number multiplication (K), the 
controller (st), by means of a second digit assignment,  

 
causes a fourth basic weight (g4) to be assigned to the 

first and second subfields (T1, T2), and a fifth basic 
weight (g5) to be assigned to the third and fourth subfields 

(T3, T4), and, in accordance with the resulting 
weight, the second subfield (T2) to be subtracted from 

the first subfield (T1) and, separately therefrom, the 
third and fourth subfields (T3, T4) to be added to 

provide, respectively, 2m digits of the real part (R3) 
and 2m digits of the imaginary part (I3) of the third 

complex number (K3). 
A multiplier as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that in case of a real- and complex-number multiplication, 

the arrangement of the partial products p(Nz,Ns) 
forms a rectangular partial-product field (sp) which 

comprises 4m digits in the row direction and 2m or less 
than 2m digits in the column direction, and
 
that the positions of the subfields (T1 to T4) in the 

rectangular partial-product field (sp) are determined by 
the associated basic weights (g1 to g5). 
A multiplier as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that in case of a multiplication of 

real or complex binary numbers, the first basic weight 
(gl) has the value 2
2m
, the second basic weight (g2) the 
value 2
m
, the third basic weight (g3) the value 2°, the 
fourth basic weight (g4) the value 2
2m
, and the fifth 
basic weight (g5) the value 2°. 
A multiplier as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the partial products are formed 

using a Booth's algorithm.  
 
A multiplier as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that in case of a complex-number multiplication, 

the partial products of the second subfield 
(T2) are formed as negated values, and that said negated 

partial products and the partial products of the 
first subfield (T1) are added in a positionally correct 

manner in accordance with the resulting weights (g). 
A multiplier as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that each partial product (p(Nz,Ns)) is 

assigned a multiplexer (mx) whose data inputs and control 
inputs are coupled to defined digits of the first 

and second data inputs (D1, D2), respectively, and whose 
data output provides the respective partial product. 
A multiplier as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that the signals applied to the data inputs of the 

multiplexers (mx) are partly inverted. 
A multiplier as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the positionally correct addition 

of the partial products in the adding arrangement (ad) 
is performed, at least in part, by means of an adding-tree 

structure (W).
