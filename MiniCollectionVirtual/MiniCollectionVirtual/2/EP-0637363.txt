<DESCRIPTION>
 FRICTION MATERIALThis invention is concerned with friction material, for example friction material for use in brake pads or brake linings for vehicles or machinery.It is well known that brake pads or linings can suffer from corrosion problems in service. In particular, a phenomenon known as "corrosion-stiction" can under wet conditions cause the friction material to stick to the rotor (disc or drum) with the brakes applied. Corrosion- stiction occurs especially in humid conditions or when the friction material becomes contaminated with salt. It is also well known that the likelihood of corrosion-stiction can be reduced or eliminated by the incorporation of an alkali material in the friction material. In some formulations of friction material, tealcium hydroxide in powder form is included. Calcium hydroxide has the advantages that it is relatively cheap and has a low solubility so that it is not readily washed out of the friction material during service.Most modern friction material formulations include cross-linkable polymers as a binder. For example, phenolic resins are commonly used for this purpose. It is found that, if calcium hydroxide is included in such formulations, premature cross-linking of the polymer during mixing of the formulation can occur, resulting in an unusable material that can not be moulded into a fully dense brake pad or lining. Where such formulations are involved, therefore, the calcium hydroxide cannot be added to combat corrosion-stiction. 

 In British Patent Application number 9303279.5, filed on the 18th February 19930, a method is described by which an alkali material can be incorporated in a friction material r and in which the alkali material is separated from the binder of the friction material but is available to combat corrosion-stiction, is described. This method involves encapsulating particles of alkali material in a coating material which is substantially inert in relation to the uncured binder, the coating material, however, being capable of being abraded from the particles to expose the alkali material as the friction material wears in service. However, although this method incorporates alkali, the alkali and the coating material therefor has to be added to the friction material at the expense of other materials which contribute to the friction characteristics of the material, the alkali and the coating therefor giving substantially no contribution to the friction characteristics. Furthermore, the encapsulation of the alkali material is somewhat complex.It is

CLAIMS
A friction material characterised in that the material has a reactive metal selected from calcium, lithium, sodium and potassium distributed therein which, as it becomes exposed due to wear of the friction material in service, is capable of reacting with water to form a highly alkaline hydroxide.
A friction material according to Claim 1, characterised in that the metal is alloyed before incorporation in the friction material.
A friction material according to Claim 1, characterised in that the reactive metal is in the form of an intermetallic compound.
A friction material according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the reactive metal is encapsulated in a capping material which is not reactive with other materials in the friction material before incorporation in the friction material.
A friction material according to any one of Claims l to 4, characterised in that the reactive metal is in the form of a fibre or a wire.
