<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion 
engine (11), specifically to a multiple valve internal combustion 

engine (11) such as a five valve engine (11) having a plurality of at 
least two intake valves (32,33), preferrably three intake valves, 

said two intake valves (32,33) being disposed at both sides of a 
vertical plane containing the cylinder bore axis and 

extending perpendicularly to a intake camshaft axis, said 
two oppositely disposed intake valves (32,33) are to reciprocate 

along axes which intersect at a point which is below the 
upper area of the related piston when same is in its bottom 

dead centre position. In this way the intake air fed 
through said intake valves does not collide within the 

combustion chamber but reliable vertical tumble is created. 
Moreover, a cylinder head (17) and bearing caps (53) bolting 
arrangement facilitates machining and simplifies assembly 

and maintainence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine
comprising a cylinder block defining at least one cylinder bore
in which a piston reciprocates, a crankshaft journaled for
rotation about an axis at one end of said cylinder bore and
driven by said piston, a cylinder head affixed to said cylinder
block and enclosing the other end of said cylinder bore, at
least two intake passages formed in said cylinder head (17) and
terminated at associated intake valve seats lying on opposite
sides of a first plane containing the axis of said cylinder
bore and extending perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of
said crankshaft, at least two poppet-type intake valves
supported for reciprocation about respective reciprocal axes by
said cylinder head and having head portions for controlling the
flow through said intake valve seats, whereby said intake
valves' reciprocal axes lying at acute angles to a second plane
containing said cylinder bore axis extending perpendicularly to
said first plane and at opposite acute angles to said first
plane.The use of multiple valves for improving engine performance
is well known and generally accepted. When using multiple
valves it is the common practice to provide a pair of valve
serving related ports that are disposed on one side of a
plane containing the axis of the cylinder bore and wherein
the valves reciprocate about reciprocal axes that are
disposed at an acute angle to this plane. In order to
increase the amount of valve lift without decreasing the
compression ratio it has also been the practice to incline
the valve stems and associated ports to a plane that is
perpendicular to the first-mentioned plane and which also
passes through the cylinder bore axis. The valves are
disposed at opposite acute angles to this plane. As a
result of this construction, when the valves serve the
intake function, the flow which enters the chamber through
the individual valves will tend to intersect in the cylinder
bore. This has certain disadvantages. Specifically, it is
not always possible to provide the desired flow pattern in
the cylinder bore and interfering turbulence may occur. The use of two intake valves disposed as in the preceding
paragraph is also used in combination with engines having
three intake valves per cylinder. The two valves having the
disposition disclosed form side intake valves and a centre
intake valve is disposed between these two side intake
valves and closer to the outer periphery of the cylinder
bore on the side opposite the first plane. Again, this can
