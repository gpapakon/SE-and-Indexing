<ABSTRACT>
A battery powered computer system determines when the system is not in use by monitoring various events associated with the operation of the system. The system preferably monitors the number of cache read misses and write operations, i.e., the cache hit rate, and reduces the system clock frequency when the cache hit rate rises above a certain level. When the cache hit rate is above a certain level, then it can be assumed that the processor is executing a tight loop, such as when the processor is waiting for a key to be pressed and then the frequency can be reduced without affecting system performance. Alternatively, the apparatus monitors the occurrence of memory page misses, I/O write cycles or other events to determine the level of activity of the computer system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to battery powered computer
systems, and more particularly, to circuits and methods for
reducing the power consumption of the computer system.Portable computer systems are rapidly developing the
capabilities of conventional desktop or floor mounted
personal computer systems. Hard disk units are being
integrated into portable computers because of the large
amounts of information being processed and the large size
of many application programs. A floppy disk unit is
integrated in the vast majority of portable computers, even
if a hard disk unit is installed, to allow loading of
information and use of applications requiring key disks,
and also to allow use of diagnostic programs. Modems have
been integrated into portable computers for some time to
allow communications and information transfer between the
user and a remote location, for example, the home office.
The displays in portable computer systems are becoming much
more elaborate and readable. The pixel count on the
standard liquid crystal displays (LCD's) utilized is
increasing, as is the viewing angle. The use of
backlighting allows use of LCD's in low light environments
and improves the contrast ratio of the display. More
complex circuitry is being installed in portable computers
to support these improved peripheral devices and to support
the increased speeds and capabilities of the
microprocessors utilized in portable computer systems.The various peripheral devices and high speed
circuitry mentioned above consume large amounts of power
when operating. This has resulted in problems in portable
computer systems because these systems are generally
desired to be used in locations where alternating current
is not available. This has made it very difficult to
provide all the possible functionality available and yet
have an acceptable battery life when the portable computer 
system is battery powered. Using CMOS components helped
reduce the power consumption of the circuitry, but even the
use of CMOS components is insufficient at the clock speeds
and performance levels of available circuitry. Therefore
a dilemma arises whether to provide lesser functionality
with longer battery life or greater functionality with
lesser battery life or even no battery operation.Various alternatives were tried to resolve the
problem. For example, the International Business Machines
(IBM) Corporation PC Convertible included a switch which
the user could press to place the computer system in a
standby mode. However, the PC convertible was relatively
simpl
