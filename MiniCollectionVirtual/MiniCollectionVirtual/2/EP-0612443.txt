<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made under a contract with the
Department of the Air Force, and the U.S. Government has certain
rights therein.This invention is in the field of triggering lightning
through radiation, particularly lasers, to enable protection of
airports and rocket launch areas, and to prevent or reduce hail
in agricultural areas.There have been attempts in the mid 70's to trigger
lightning by sending a powerful infrared laser beam through the
atmosphere [Jr. C.W. Schubert. The Laser Lightning Rod System:
a Feasibility Study. Technical Report AFFDL-TR-78-60, Air Force
Flight Dynamics Laboratory, 1977]. Because of the long wavelength
of these lasers, it would have taken a 100-photon process
to ionize the air. However, the field of the intense laser beam
was sufficient to create avalanche ionization of air, leading to
a plasma. The method failed, because the dense plasma created
is opaque to the beam, and prevented further propagation of the
laser radiation.Lightning between ground and cloud can be triggered by
inserting a conducting path to ground above the naturally-occurring
space charge layer at a speed higher than the speed of
space-charge ions. When this happens, space charge can no longer
reduce the field at the tip of the conductor, so the enhanced
fields at the tip can be large enough to initiate breakdown, with
a resulting leader propagating from the ground to the cloud. A
number of investigators have used this principle to trigger
lightning by firing small rockets, pulling up grounded wires
[M.M. Newman, J.R. Stahmann, J.D. Robb, E.A. Lewis, S.G. Martin,
and S. V. Zinn. Triggered lightning at close range. J. Geophys.
Res., 72, 1967]. The success rate of this method is only about 50%. The
speed of the rocket is not always sufficient to prevent formation
of space charges that reduce the field between the cloud and the
rocket. Finally, rockets cannot be fired continuously, as a
laser can.US-A-4 017 767 discloses the use of a beam of pulses of coherent radiations at a single frequency to invite incipient lightning to discharge along the path of the beam.In accordance with the invention, as defined in claims 1 and 8, lightning is
triggered by creating ionized oxygen and nitrogen plus electrons-
an ionized channel-by a train of high energy femtosecond UV
pulses, and simultaneously sending a train of laser pulses of
longer wavelength and duration (e.g. visible) through the same
path to maintain the conductivity of the channel for a time long
enough for the lightning to occur (the longer wavelength

<CLAIMS>
A method of enabling the discharge of electricity or lightning in the atmosphere
in a manner preventing the formation of space charges which would reduce the

strength of electric fields in the atmosphere, comprising transmitting into the
atmosphere a beam of pulses of radiation from a laser, wherein


a first train of pulses (11) of radiation, having a wavelength within the ultra-violet
range, and of a duration sufficient to create an electrically-conductive ionised

channel in the atmosphere, is transmitted along the beam, and

characterised in that

a second train of pulses (13) of radiation, having a wavelength longer than that
of the fi
rst pulses, is concurrently transmitted along the beam to maintain the
electrical conductivity of the channel long enough for electricity or lightning to be

discharged along the beam.
A method as claimed in claim 1, including the further step of transmitting along
the beam a third train of pulses (16) of radiation, having a wavelength greater than

the visible range and of sufficient strength and duration to evaporate a substantial
proportion of any water droplets intercepted by the beam, the pulses of the third train

preceding or overlapping the transmission of the pulses of the first train.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the repetition rate of the pulses
of the first and second trains is at least 10 Hz.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the pulses of the first
train are frequency modulated so as to be compressed as they pass through the

atmosphere.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the wavelength of the
pulses of the second train is in the visible range. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the wavelength of each
pulse of the first train is about 248 nm, and its duration is less than 500

femtoseconds.
A method as claimed in claim 2, or claim 2 and any claim dependent therefrom,
in which the frequency of each pulse of the third train is in the infra-red range.
Apparatus for enabling the discharge of electricity or lightning in the
atmosphere in a manner preventing the formation of space charges which would

reduce the strength of electric fields in the atmosphere, comprising transmitting into
the atmosphere a beam of pulses of radiation from a laser, the apparatus including


means (11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20) for transmitting into the atmosphere a first
train of pulses of radiation from a laser, the pulses having a wavelength within the

ultra-violet part of the optical spectrum, and of duration long enough to create an
electrically-conductive ionised channel in the atmosphere, and characterised by including
means (13, 18, 19, 20) for transmitting a second train of pulses of radiation
along the same beam, concurrently with the first train, the pulses of the second train

having a wavelength longer than that of the first train, thereby to maintain the
electrical conductivity of the channel long enough for electricity or lightning to be

discharged along the beam.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, including means for transmitting along the
beam a third train of pulses of radiation having a wavelength longer than that of the

second train, and over a period preceding or overlapping the transmission of the first
train, thereby to cause substantial evaporation of any water droplets intercepted by

the beam.
