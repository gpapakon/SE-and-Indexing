<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to laundry detergent compositions containing
one or more amide substituted peroxyacid bleaching compounds and
more especially to solid laundry detergent compositions containing
such compounds.The use of amide substituted peroxyacid bleaching compounds in
detergent compositions has been disclosed in, for example, EP-A-0170386.
These bleaching compounds perform well over wide
temperature and pH ranges and are effective at removing hydrophobic
soils including body soils and greasy soils from fabrics to provide
overall good dingy fabric cleaning. Their use in detergent
compositions is complemented by the presence of one or more
additional bleaching components such as peroxy acid bleach precursors
(bleach activators) which typically give effective removal of hydrophilic
stains including tea, wine and coffee.The Applicants have now discovered that such amide substituted
peroxyacid bleaching compounds are particularly suitable for inclusion
in laundry compositions formulated for use in the cleaning of coloured
fabrics. Their suitability for this purpose arises from their unexpected
lack of propensity to cause colour damage to such fabrics during the
wash process and their ability to limit fabric malodour caused by
microbial spoilage. Furthermore, these 'colour-safe' bleaches have
also been found to give surprisingly good performance under
conditions of high pH (>10.5) and water hardness (>12° Clark
hardness).However, the inclusion of peroxyacid bleaching compounds in
detergent compositions has been restricted hitherto by the relative
instability of these compounds both as is and in use. Peroxyacid 
bleaching compounds lose available oxygen at a significant rate in the
presence of free ions of heavy metals such as iron, copper and
manganese and also in the presence of moisture, these effects being
accelerated at temperatures in excess of about 30°C.US 4925585 relates to a detergent processing invention for making concentrated detergents
from cold dough. The moisture content of the dough is controlled during processing.
Moisture and free heavy metal ions are unavoidable components of
conventional granular detergent compositions. The presence of these
components has resulted in only marginally acceptable peroxyacid
bleaching compound stability when in such compositions under
Northern European summer conditions, where the average maximum
temperature over the hottest months is from 21°C to 25°C.
Unacceptable stability is obtained under temperatures higher than this
such as are found in the
