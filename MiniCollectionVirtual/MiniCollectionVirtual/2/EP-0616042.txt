lengths of 200 µm or more in the longitudinal direction. 
Furthermore, the steel pipe is manufactured by rolling or 
forging to have a matrix not including B type inclusions having 

dimensions of 200 µm or more in the longitudinal direction 
within 4 mm of the inner surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to steel products, such as
plates and pipes excellent in sulfide cracking resistance and
suitable as component members of vessels, reactors and line-pipes
for storing, refining or transporting crude oil or gas
containing hydrogen sulfide.As is well known, hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) or
sulfide stress cracking (SSC), hereinafter collectively referred
to as "sulfide cracking", is a serious problem with steel
plates and pipes used for oil tankers, reactors and vessels, or
with line-pipes and oil-country-tubular-goods (OCTG) for crude
oil or gas containing hydrogen sulfide.HIC is generated under no external stress, whereas SSC is
generated under static stress. This sulfide cracking is one of
the embrittling phenomena that affect steel, that is, hydrogen
embrittlement occurs due to the absorption of the hydrogen
produced when steel is corroded in a wet hydrogen sulfide
environment.On the basis of studies of sulfide cracking, many counter
measures have been proposed:
a) The absorption of hydrogen into steel in a wet 
hydrogen sulfide environment is suppressed by the addition of
copper, thus improving HIC and SSC resistance.b) Since HIC occurs where sharp edges of A type
inclusions composed of MnS are taken as the initiation sites,
the sharp edges of the inclusions are eliminated by the
addition of calcium, thereby controlling the morphology of
sulfides.c) The number of inclusions is reduced and the shape of
sulfide is controlled by the addition of calcium (disclosed in
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 56-13463).
JP-A-55 113 861 discloses an improvement of HIC resistance by specifying
chemical composition of the material, which broadly overlaps that of the
invention, in controlling Ca, O and S, and by specifying the rolling reduction.
Volumes and amounts of A-type and B-type inclusions are controlled.d) Since susceptibility to HIC and SSC is increased by
the formation of a hardened structure at the center segregation
with high concentrations of manganese and phosphorus, the
segregation is reduced by soaking diffusion, or the formation of
the hardened structure is prevented by accelerated cooling
after rolling.With these measures, in small scale laboratory tests
using small-size specimens which are immersed in what is called
a NACE solution "0.5% CH3COOH + 5%NaCl, saturated with H2S at 1
atm, 25 °C", the HIC resistance could be significantly reduced.Steel products used in the above-mentioned environments
must satisfy the requirement that the crack length ratio
