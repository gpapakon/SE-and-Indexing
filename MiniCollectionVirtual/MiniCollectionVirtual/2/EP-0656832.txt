<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of plasticized fluoropolymers,
including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers.Plasticizing additives are used in plastics and elastomers to
achieve various effects. Such plasticizers may improve melt processing
characteristics or may modify physical properties of the polymer under use
conditions, or both.Highly fluorinated polymers have desirable combinations of
electrical, chemical, and thermal properties. However, the high molecular
weight required to realize the properties necessary for severe service conditions
can make fluoropolymers difficult to process. Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE)
homopolymers are so intractable that conventional melt processing techniques
cannot be used and articles are fabricated by methods adapted from powder
metallurgy. Partially-crystalline copolymers of TFE with other fluorinated
monomers are melt-fabricable but processing rates are limited, especially for
grades designated for the most severe service. Likewise, the rates at which
fluoroelastomers, both vinylidene fluoride (VF2) copolymers and
perfluoroelastomers, can be shaped are limited. In addition, the accessible
balance of properties for fluoroelastomers is unsatisfactory for some uses, a
softer or less stiff compound frequently being desired.U.S. Patent 3,665,067 discloses the use of hexafluorobenzene as
a plasticizer for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the fabrication process
known as ram extrusion. U.S. Patent 4,012,453 discloses the use of
chlorofluorinated aromatic hydrocarbons as plasticizers for
trifluorochloroethylene polymers.U.S. Patent 2,510,078 discloses the use of fluorinated oils as
plasticizers for certain fluoroplastics including PTFE. U.S Patent 3,434,996
discloses the use of chlorofluorinated ethanes as extrusion lubricants for PTFE
to overcome the deleterious effect on properties of oils, greases, and waxes
when used as plasticizers. U.S. Patent 3,030,328 discloses a copolymer of TFE
and a fluorinated alpha-olefin plasticized with esters of fluoroalcohols with
cyclic polycarboxylic acids to improve melt flow and toughness. U.S. Patent 3,069,401 discloses the use of VF2/HFP copolymer
greases in VF2/HFP fluoroelastomers to change viscosity without altering the
properities of the cured elastomer. Since the chemical compositions of the
grease and the fluoroelastomer are similar, this appears to be equivalent to
modifying the molecular weight distribution of the fluoroelastomer. U.S. Patent
4,810,765 teaches the use of cotelomers of VF2 which can participate in
peroxide
