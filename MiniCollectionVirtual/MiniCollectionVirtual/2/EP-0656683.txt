<ABSTRACT>
It is known to use an oscillator, which drives a mixer, in integrated circuits. Furthermore, an RF signal, which is converted by the mixer into an IF signal, is fed to the mixer by an external resonant circuit. In the case of an arrangement of this type, interference is produced as a result of the reception and transmission of high frequencies. The invention is based on the object of providing, in a simple manner, an arrangement for reducing interference in resonant circuits in integrated circuits. According to the invention, the external resonant circuit is integrated in the integrated circuit. The inteference which is otherwise produced by the connection pins consequently disappears. In particular for television receivers.

Arrangement with interference reducing operation at an integrated circuit including a
controller (2), an oscillator (3), a mixer (4), a capacitance diode (C) and an inductivity

(L)

characterized in that

the controller (2) is connected via a first bonding wire forming a first inductivity to the
capacitance diode (C) and
