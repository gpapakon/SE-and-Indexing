<ABSTRACT>
A combined catalytic cracking and olefin production process uses a coked 
catalytic cracking catalyst to dehydrogenate an alkane feed and form an olefin rich 

product. Preferably, the coked catalytic cracking catalyst has a carbon content of about 
0.2-10 wt%. The catalyst preferably comprises a crystalline tetrahedral framework 

oxide component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined catalytic cracking and olefin producing
process.The emergence of low emissions fuels has created a need to increase the
availability of olefins for use in alkylation, oligomerization, MTBE and ETBE synthesis. In
addition, a low cost supply of olefins continues to be in demand to serve as feedstock for
polyolefin production.Fixed bed processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation have recently attracted
renewed interest for increasing olefin production. However, these type of processes typically
require a high capital investment as well as a high operating cost. It is, therefore, advantageous
to increase olefin yield using processes which require only a minimal amount of capital
investment. It would be particularly advantageous to increase olefin yield in catalytic cracking
processes.US-A-4,830,728 discloses a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit
which is operated to maximize olefin production. The FCC unit has two separate risers in which
different feed streams are introduced. The operation of the risers is designed so that a certain
catalyst will act to convert a heavy gas oil in one riser and a different catalyst will act to crack a
lighter olefin/naphtha feed in the other riser. Conditions within the heavy gas oil riser are
modified to maximize either gasoline or olefin production. The primary means of maximizing
production of the desired product is by using a specified catalyst.A problem inherent in producing olefin products using FCC units is that the
process depends upon a specific catalyst balance to maximize production. In addition, even if
a specific catalyst balance can be maintained to maximize overall olefin production, olefin 
selectivity is generally low due to undesirable side reactions such as extensive cracking,
isomerization, aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions. It is, therefore, desirable that
olefin production be maximized in a process which allows a high degree of control over olefin
selectivity.EP-A-0325437 describes and claims a process for regenerating a coke-contaminated
fluid cracking catalyst in a regeneration zone at a pressure in the range from above 240 kPa to
446 kPa and a temperature in the range from 650°C to 815°C while injecting the regeneration
zone with enough oxygen-containing regeneration gas to maintain a dense fluid bed of
regeneration catalyst, and regenerate the catalyst before returning it to a fluid cracker,
comprising,
