<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the use of a 
polyalkylene glycol for reducing abrasion of a solid pharmaceutical 
dosage form. It has been found that a subcoat comprising an amount 
of a pharmaceutically acceptable polyalkylene glycol applied to an 
uncoated dosage form reduces abrasion. Known from US-A-4 775 536 are subcoats of polyethylene 
glycol of molecular weight 4500 or 8000. Furthermore GB-A-1544761 
discloses a subcoat of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 4000. 
These subcoats were applied to uncoated pharmaceutical dosage forms. EP-A-133 827 discloses the use of an undercoat containing a plastifier 
such as PEG to reduce abrasion. In accordance with the present invention, use of a 
polyalkylene glycol is disclosed for reducing abrasion of a solid 
pharmaceutical dosage form subject to abrasion during the coating 
process. To achieve the desired result, a subcoat comprising an 
amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable polyalkylene glycol coating 
effective to reduce abrasion is applied to an uncoated dosage form. 
The term "polyalkylene" refers to polymerized alkylenes, such as 
polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutylene. The subcoat is applied from an aqueous solution which 
comprises about a 1 to 50% w/w or preferably 5 to 20% w/w of a 
polyalkylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) having a molecular 
weight between about 4,000 to 10,000, preferably between about 6,000 to 
about 8,000. The amount of the subcoat is such that it is sufficient to 
reduce the abrasion compared to solid pharmaceutical dosage forms not 
having said subcoat. Abrasion as used herein means any type of 
roughening or eroding of the surface of the solid dosage form. Generally, 
a dry weight of subcoat between 0.02% to about 0.5% w/w of the uncoated  
 
tablet is sufficient to reduce abrasion. Preferably, the dry weight of subcoat 
is about 0.1% w/w of the uncoated tablet. Any conventional method of applying the subcoat may be 
utilized. For example the subcoat solution may be sprayed onto the solid 
pharmaceutical dosage form for between about 0.5 to 5 minutes. Other 
methods for applying the subcoat include fluid bed coating and a rotary 
granulator process. An exemplary method employing a conventional 
coating pan with baffles and conditions for applying the subcoat are as 
follows: 
Spray rate40-45 g/min Total coating time2 to 10 min. Solution volume90 to 150 mL Drum rotation speed9 to 20 rpm Air inlet temperature60 - 65°C Air exhaust temperature45 - 50°C Once the subcoat has been applied, any
