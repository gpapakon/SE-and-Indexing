<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic recording system, an asymmetry detector (240) 
reverses the phase of a read, single-frequency test signal to 

indicate to a micro-controller (210) whether recording signal 
asymmetry is present. Upon detecting such asymmetry, the 

micro-controller (210) causes a current source (260) coupled 
to the recording head (230) to adjust a write current to 

correct the timing of a written data signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic data storage and 
retrieval systems, particularly to magnetic recording systems. Magnetic recording systems are used widely for storing 
(i.e., writing) and retrieving (i.e., reading) digital or analog 
data signals to and from magnetic media, such as disks, tapes, 
drums, and the like. In the course of magnetic recording, 
however, signal asymmetry may arise when an initial, written 
signal does not remain substantially the same or "symmetric" to 
such written signal, when such written signal is read 
subsequently. Typically, because of non-uniformities or premagnetization 
in the magnetic media and/or the recording heads, 
undesirable signal asymmetry may result. Conventionally to eliminate signal asymmetry from recording 
systems, a test signal is recorded in magnetic media, and based 
on a subsequent reading of the recorded test signal, a manual 
adjustment is made to the recording head circuitry to compensate 
for any detected signal asymmetry. The conventional approach, 
however, is manually tedious and does not adjust asymmetry in 
response to asymmetry arising subsequently to initial manual  
 
adjustment. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved 
technique for adjusting asymmetric recording signals. The invention involves correcting signal asymmetry in a 
magnetic recording system by writing a test signal to a magnetic 
medium and then reading the written test signal to detect signal 
asymmetry therein, by phase-reversing and filtering the test 
signal. If the phase-reversed and filtered signal generates an 
indication signal, which is un-changed at the time of phase 
reversal, then no signal asymmetry is detected. However, if the 
indication signal changes, because the duty cycle of the 
subsequently-read test signal is not 50 %, then signal asymmetry 
is detected. To correct the detected asymmetry, a control signal, which 
modifies a write current passing through the recording head, is 
adjusted in response to the asymmetry indication. In particular, 
the magnitude of the control signal may be determined according 
to a linear regression analysis of previously-determined control 
signal magnitudes.  FIG. 1 is a generalized schematic block diagram of data 
storage-retrieval system 200 coupled to external device 201 and 
including micro-controller 210, recording head circuitry 230,
