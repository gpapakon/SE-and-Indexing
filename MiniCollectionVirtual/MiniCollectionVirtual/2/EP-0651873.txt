<ABSTRACT>
A device for heating boilers (1) in heating plants comprises a means (2) for heating a heat carrying medium present in the boiler and circulating out thereof in the heating plant as well as a means (11) adapted to detect the temperature of the heat carrying medium present in the boiler and send signals to the heating means (2) to start and stop the heating of the medium when a first lower temperature level is underpassed and a second higher temperature level is exceeded, respectively, by the medium in the heating boiler (1). The device comprises further means (12) adapted to delay the start of the heating means (2) when the first temperature level is reached by the medium and this is detected by the detecting means (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for heating boilers in 
heating plants having a means for heating a heat carrying medium 
present in the boiler and circulating out thereof in the heating plant 
as well as a means adapted to detect the temperature of the heat 
carrying medium present in the boiler and send signals to the heating 
means to start and stop the heating of the medium when a first 
lower temperature level is underpassed and a second higher temperature 
level is exceeded, respectively, by the medium in the 
heating boiler. The invention is in particular directed to devices for oil and gas boilers, 
and it will as a consequence thereof be discussed below for this 
application for exemplifying but non-limitative purpose. A disadvantage 
in common to all heating boilers for heating the rooms of a 
building and provide tap hot-water consists in that they are dimensioned 
so that they are able to manage conditions, in which an extremely 
high heating demand exists, i.e. during the coldest winter 
days. This means that the capacity of the heating boilers is utilised 
to the greatest extent during cold periods, but the heating boilers get 
over-dimensioned with respect to the rest of the year, when the 
heating demand generally is only a fraction of the amount of heat 
which may be supplied by the boilers, so that the efficiency sometimes 
will be comparatively low.  
 It would therefor be desired to improve the efficiency of a heating 
boiler, so that it may comply with the heating demand when this is 
extremely high but nevertheless requires a considerably lower 
amount of supplied energy, in the oil boiler case fuel in the form of 
oil, for obtaining the heating comfort aimed at during periods of 
both high and low heat demands, and especially in the latter case, 
in which the heating boiler must be considered to be strongly over-dimensioned. A device which partially obtains this is known through US-A- 4 
850 310 and it function in the way, that it has a sensor for the indoor 
temperature, and when this indoor temperature after switching 
the heating means off has fallen to a pre-selected value, a 
signal is sent through the boiler to a control unit, which also receives 
a signal with respect to the outdoor temperature 
prevailing and gets a time indication with respect to the length of 
the period of time elapsed from the switching off of the heating 
means until the pre-selected indoor temperature has been 
reached. The control unit calculates on the bases on these data 
a factor, by
