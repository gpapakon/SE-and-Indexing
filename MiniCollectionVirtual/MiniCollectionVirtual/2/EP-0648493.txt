<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of IRF-1 or nucleic acids containing the coding information 
for IRF-1 for the reversal of the phenotype of transformed cells. Nucleic acids coding for 

IRF-1 can be used as tumor suppressor genes in the gene therapy of cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of the transcription factor interferon regulatory 
factor-1 (IRF-1) or nucleic acid molecules containing the coding information for IRF-1 
to 
reverse the phenotype of transformed cells. Interferon regulatory factor-1(IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and IRF-2, 
its antagonistic 
repressor, have been identified as regulators of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible 
genes. It has been shown previously that IRF-1 manifest anti-oncogenic activity in NIH 3T3 
cells which are transformed by overexpression of IRF-2. In fact, when the IRF-2 
gene was 
overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, the cells became transformed and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity 
in nude mice. However, this transformed phenotype was reversed by concomitant 
overexpression of the IRF-1 gene (Harada et al., Science259, 971-974, 1993). It has 
been shown that the human IRF-1 gene maps to chromosome 5q31.1, a region frequently 
deleted in patients with leukemia or preleukemic myelodysplastic sydromes (Willman et al., 
Science259, 968-971, 1993). In the present invention, it has surprisingly been found that the reversal of the transformed 
phenotype by IRF-1 is not restricted to cells transformed by its natural antagonist, IRF-2, 
but can also be achieved in cells transformed by other oncogenes. So this invention makes it 
possible to revert the transformed phenotype in tumor cells more generally IRF-1 
and 
nucleic acids coding for IRF-1 can be applied in the therapy of cancer, especially in gene 
therapy. The inventor of the present invention attempted to revert the phenotype of rat Rat 1 cells 
transformed by either c-myc gene or fosB gene. These two genes are well known oncogenes 
and their properties have been well studied (Shiroki et al., Mol. Cell. Biol.6, 4379-4386, 
1986; Nakabeppu et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 4157-4166, 1993). A retrovirus, pDGIRF1, 
which expresses murine IRF-1 upon infection, was previously constructed (Harada et al., 
Science259, 971-974, 1993). The c-myc-transformed 3Y1 cell or fosB-transformed 
Rat-1A 
cell, termed RmycY1 and Rat-1A(FosB), respectively, both show anchorage-independent 
growth and enhanced tumorigenicity in rat or nude mice (Shiroki et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 
4379-4386, 1986; Nakabeppu et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 4157-4166, 1993). 5 x 10‚Åµ of each 
cells were infected by the pDGIRF-1 virus at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10, 
using exactly the method employed by Harada et al., and subsequently limiting diluted to 
obtain single
