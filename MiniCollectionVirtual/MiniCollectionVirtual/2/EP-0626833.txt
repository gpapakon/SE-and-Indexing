<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intraocular 
lenses, particularly to methods for attaching a haptic 
to an optic using laser welding. Intraocular lenses have been known since about 
1950. They are used to replace the natural lenses of 
eyes that have been damaged by trauma or disease, such 
as cataracts. A typical intraocular lens ("IOL") 
comprises an artificial lens ("optic") and at least one 
support member ("haptic") for positioning the IOL 
within the capsular bag of the eye. The optic may be 
formed from any of a number of different materials, 
including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and acrylics, 
and it may be hard, relatively flexible or even fully 
deformable so that the IOL can be rolled or folded and 
inserted through a relatively small incision in the 
eye. The haptic generally is made of some resilient 
material, such as polypropylene or flexible copolymers 
of PMMA. IOL's may be characterized as either "one-piece" 
or "multi-piece". With one-piece IOL's, the 
haptic and the optic are formed integrally as a blank 
and the IOL is then milled or lathed to the desired 
shape and configuration. The multi-piece IOL's are 
formed either by attaching the haptic to a pre-formed 
optic or by molding the optic around an end of the 
haptic. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,834,751 and 4,894,062 (both to 
Knight, et al) describe haptic attachment methods  
 
whereby the haptic and an anchoring member are joined 
and the optic is molded around the end of the haptic 
having the anchoring member. While these methods 
provide strong haptic-optic interlock, the procedure 
for molding an optic around the previously joined 
haptic and anchor member is complex and requires 
special care to maintain the haptic in place while the 
optic material is cured, and to remove the cured IOL 
from the mold without damaging the haptic. Many methods for attaching a haptic to a pre-formed 
optic are known, including those involving the 
use of adhesives. If an adhesive is used to attach a 
haptic to an optic, the adhesive must be strong, 
biologically inert and resistant to degradation by 
bodily fluids. At present, there are few materials 
that satisfy all these requirements. In addition, 
there will always be a concern that the adhesive will 
deteriorate over time, resulting in loose or detached 
haptics within the eye. Other more common methods for attaching a haptic 
to a pre-formed optic involve the use of heat. One 
such haptic attachment methods involves drilling 
intersecting holes into the periphery of an optic and 
inserting

<CLAIMS>
A method for attaching at least one colored haptic (20) to a 
transparent optic (10) of an intraocular lens (1), comprising the steps 

of providing a peripheral edge (17) of the optic with at least one hole 
(12), inserting an end (21) of the haptic (20) into the hole (12), and 

aiming a laser at a portion of the haptic within the hole such that on 
firing the laser, 

radiation passes through the optic (10) essentially 
without absorption and is absorbed by the haptic (20), thereby causing 

the haptic to fuse with the optic,  
 

characterized in 
that the laser has a power level of less than 5 watts and emits 

radiation within a visible spectrum that is matched to the radiation 
absorption spectrum of the colored haptic. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the haptic (20) comprises a 
violet-, green-, or blue-colored material. 
A method according to claim 2, such that when blue-colored, the 
material comprises polymethylmethacrylate with a copper 

phthalocyanine-doped core. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
transparent optic (10) comprises plastic including 

polymethylmethacrylate, or polycarbonate. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the haptic 
(20) comprises thermoplastic, including copolymers of esters of acrylic 

acid and methacrylic acid; polymethylmethacrylate, a polyimide, 
polyvinylidene difluoride, or polypropylene. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the visible 
spectrum comprises a wavelength range of from about 400 nanometers to 

about 700 nanometers.  
 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the laser 
comprises an Argon laser, a tunable dye laser, or a Krypton laser. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, wherein at least one 
hole (12) is drilled in the peripheral edge (17) of the optic (10). 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the shape of 
the optic (10) is a closed curve.
