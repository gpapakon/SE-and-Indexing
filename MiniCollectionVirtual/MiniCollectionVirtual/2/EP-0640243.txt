<ABSTRACT>
A relay has a polarized magnetic system (2) with a three-pole permanent magnet (17) arranged above a coil (14) and rocking armature (18) which actuates a contact spring (30) arranged beneath the coil by means of a frontally arranged slide (23). The contact spring (30) is inserted from one side into the base body, by means of an elongated spring carrier (29), whereas a counter contact element (33) is inserted therein from the opposite side. This relay allows with a compact design long insulating sections between the magnetic system and the set of contacts, as well as a short circuit-resistant design of the set of contacts.

Polarized electromagnetic relay having a coil 
(11, 14; 43, 44), an elongated permanent magnet (17; 47) 

which is arranged above the coil and parallel to the coil 
axis and which has like end poles at each of its two ends 

and a centre pole opposite thereto in its centre, having 
a core (15, 16; 45, 46) which is arranged inside the coil 

and which is coupled at both ends to the two ends of the 
permanent magnet by means of yoke legs (1
5b, 16b; 45b, 
46b), and also having an elongated rocking armature (18; 

48) which is mounted above the centre pole of the permanent 
magnet and forms a working air gap with each of the 

two yoke legs (15b, 16b; 45b, 46b), characterized in that 
the armature (18) is mounted by means of a bearing spring 

(19) which is attached directly to its centre section and 
can be latched on both sides to the permanent magnet 

(17), in that a contact assembly having at least one 
contact spring (30; 54) arranged approximately parallel 

to the coil axis and at least one fixed contact element 
(33; 58) is arranged underneath the coil (11, 14; 43, 44) 

and in that there is arranged in front of one end face of 
the coil (11, 14; 43, 44) a slide (23; 53) which can be 

moved perpendicular to the coil axis and is made of 
insulating material and which is coupled, on the one 

hand, to a movable end of the armature and, on the other 
hand, to a movable end of the contact spring. 
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the contact assembly is arranged in a main body (1; 41) 

made of insulating material with connecting elements 
brought out to the underside and is screened by said main  

 
body in a box-like or labyrinth-like fashion from the 

magnet system. 
Relay according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the main body (1; 41) forms a partition (3) 

between contact assembly and coil, on which partition 
side walls formed on at the top (4, 5, 6, 7) surround the 

magnet system and/or side walls formed on at the bottom 
surround the contact assembly. 
Relay according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
there is provided in the partition (3) a slot (40) into 

which an insulating-material plate (39) is inserted from 
one side. 
Relay according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the main body has side walls which are drawn upward in 

trough-like fashion and between which the magnet system 
(2) can be pressed in as a fit and can be fixed in an 

aligned position. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the slide (23; 53) has, in each 

case, recesses (25; 38) into which deformable end 
sections of the contact spring (30), on the one hand, and 

an extension of the armature (18; 48), on the other, fit. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the essentially straight armature 

(48) is mounted above a centre pole of the permanent 
magnet (47), which centre pole is raised with respect to 

the end poles. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the permanent magnet (17) has 

essentially the shape of a straight beam and in that the 
armature (18) is bent away slightly from the end poles of 

the permanent magnet at both ends. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the contact spring (30; 54) with a 

rigid support (29; 55) is inserted from one side into a 
retaining groove of the main body and a fixed, normally 

open contact element (33) is inserted into mounting 
grooves of the main body (1) from the opposite side. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 9,  
 

characterized in that the joint between the contact 
spring (30) and its support (29) is situated opposite the 

contact point and in that contact spring and support 
extend approximately parallel and at a small spacing from 

one another over a substantial section of their length. 
Relay according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the normally open contact element (33) has an 

elongated ferromagnetic section (33a) which extends 
opposite the contact spring (30) and parallel to the 

contact spring over a substantial section. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the contact spring (30) is split, 

a first spring leg (31) forming a main contact (34, 35) 
formed with noble metal with the normally open contact 

element (33) and a second spring leg (32) forming an 
early contact (36, 37) formed with refractory material. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the core comprises two identical L-shaped 

parts (15, 16).
