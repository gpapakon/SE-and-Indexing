<ABSTRACT>
A support device (1) with a first bearing part (33) and a second bearing 
part (51). The first bearing part (33) is in a housing (11), while the second bearing part 

(51) is provided on a locking piece (53) fastened to the housing (11). Leaking along the 
locking piece (53) of a fluid present between the bearing parts (33, 51) is prevented by 

the use of a sealing element (59). 
The sealing element (59) is provided under pretension between the locking 
piece (53) and a pressure member (61, 87) fastened to the housing (11), the locking 

piece (53) bearing on the housing (11) under the influence of the pretension of the 
sealing element (59). Since the locking piece (53) bears on the housing (11) under the 

influence of the pretension of the sealing element (59), the locking piece (53) is fixed in 
an accurate position relative to the housing (11). An accurately defined mutual position 

of the first and the second bearing part (33, 51) is achieved in this manner, which is 
necessary for a good operation of the support device (1). 
The support device (1) is used for supporting a rotary information disc 
(105) in a data storage unit (101).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a support device with a bearing which is 
surrounded by a housing and which is provided with a first bearing part present inside 
the housing and with a second bearing part provided on a locking piece fastened to the 
housing so as to cooperate with said first bearing part. The invention also relates to a data storage unit for accommodating an 
information disc, which unit is provided with a scanning unit for cooperating with the 
information disc and with a support device according to the invention for the rotary 
support of the information disc. A support device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is shown 
in Fig. 3 of British Patent 1 222 275. The known support device comprises a shaft 
which is rotatably supported in the housing by means of a radial dynamic groove 
bearing and an axial dynamic groove bearing. The first bearing part mentioned in the 
opening paragraph belongs to the axial groove bearing and comprises a bearing surface 
13 which extends perpendicularly to the shaft, which is present on a flange 3, and 
which is provided with a pattern of grooves. The second bearing part also belongs to 
the axial groove bearing and comprises a bearing surface 14 which extends 
perpendicularly to the shaft, and which forms an inner wall of the locking piece with 
which the bearing space 5 present in the housing is closed off. A liquid lubricant is 
present between the bearing surfaces 13 and 14. To prevent leakage of the liquid 
lubricant along the locking piece, the known support device may be provided with a 
conventional sealing element which is known per se such as, for example, a sealing 
ring, which is not disclosed in the Patent and which is clamped in under pretension 
between the housing and the locking piece when the locking piece is provided on the 
housing. The known support device is further provided with grooves 12 against leakage  
 
of the liquid lubricant along the shaft 2. A disadvantage of the use of such a sealing element in the known support 
device is that the positional accuracy of the locking piece relative to the housing is 
adversely affected by the pretension of the sealing element. The pretension of the 
sealing element may give rise to deformations of the fastening means by which the 
locking piece is fastened to the housing during or after fastening of the locking piece to 
the housing. Said deformations lead to small, undesirable displacements of the locking 
piece relative to the housing, whereby the position of the first bearing part
