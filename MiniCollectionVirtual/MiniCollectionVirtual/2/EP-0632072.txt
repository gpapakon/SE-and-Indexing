acrylonitryle monomers in the presence of a rubbery 
polymer in accordance with a continuous mass and/or 

solution polymerization method by the use of serial 
polymerization device comprising two or more reactors; 

said process comprising 

(1) a first step of feeding a polymeric materials to the 
first reactor to carry out the polymerization of 

monomers in a condition where the rubbery polymer is not 
inverted to the dispersed phase, and a second step of 

adding a polymeric materials to second reactors to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and 
products therefrom for preparing rubber modified styrene resins. More 
specifically, it relates to a process for preparing 
rubber modified styrene resins which can provide molded 
articles having excellent impact resistance and high 
surface gloss. Rubber modified styrene resins has been 
manufactured by an emulsion polymerization method, a 
continuous mass polymerization method or a solution 
polymerization method. The rubber modified styrene 
resins prepared by the emulsion polymerization is excellent 
in a balance between an impact resistance and a 
surface gloss, but since this kind of modified styrene 
resins contains large amounts of impurities such as an 
emulsifying agent and a dispersant, its hue is bad and 
its manufacturing cost is high. In addition, at the 
time of the manufacture, a large amount of waste water 
is discharged, which has a bad influence on environmental 
circumstances and increases the cost of waste disposal. On the other 
hand, with regard to rubber modified styrene resins obtained by the 
continuous mass polymerization method or the solution  
 
polymerization method, there are advantages such as less 
impurities, a low manufacturing cost and no waste water, 
but the impact resistance and/or the 
surface gloss is/are insufficient. As techniques for improving the balance between 
the physical properties of the rubber modified styrene 
resins obtained by the continuous mass polymerization 
method or the solution polymerization method, for example, 
the following methods are known. Japanese Patent Publication No. 7343/1974 (which 
corresponds to U.S. Patent No. 3,658,946) discloses a 
method in which prepolymerization is carried out in a 
first polymerization reactor in a condition where a 
rubbery polymer does not invert to a dispersed phase, 
and polymerization is then done in a second 
polymerization reactor to invert the rubbery polymer to 
the dispersed phase (a prepolymerization method). 
However, in the rubber modified styrene resins obtained 
by this method, the diameter of rubber particles which 
can be controlled even by a conventional technique is 
large, and when an acrylonitrile is added to the polymerization 
system, the diameter of the rubber particles 
further increases, so that the physical properties of 
the resin deteriorate. The reasons why the physical 
properties deteriorate are that the smaller the diameter 
of the rubber particles is, the higher the surface gloss 
of the styrene resin is, and that the
