<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for the preparation of 
optionally halogenated polyolefin-substituted succinimides, 

the process comprising: 

(i) allowing the product formable by reaction of an 
optionally halogenated polyolefin with maleic anhydride to 

react with further maleic anhydride in the presence of a 
free-radical initiator; and 
(ii) reacting the product of step (i) with an amine; 
the succinimides 
per se
; and lubricating oil compositions 
and additive concentrates containing the succinimides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyolefin-substituted
succinimides and particularly, although not exclusively, to
a process for the preparation of optional-halogenated
polyolefin-substituted succinimides, to the succinimides perse
and to lubricating oil compositions and additive
concentrates containing the succinimides.Polyolefin-succinic derivatives are well established as
dispersant additives for lubricating compositions, being of
the dispersant type often referred to as ashless because of
the absence of a metal component. These derivatives are
prepared by reaction of a polyolefin with maleic anhydride,
and subsequent reaction with a polyalcohol or polyamine. The
first reaction, between the polyolefin and the maleic
anhydride, is often carried out in the presence of chlorine,
which permits a reduced reaction time, a more efficient
polyolefin utilisation and the production of
polyolefin-succinic derivatives in which the molecular
proportion of the succinic component is in significant
excess, i.e. the ratio of the number of reacted moles of
maleic anhydride per mole of polyolefin (the "succination
ratio") is significantly greater than 1:1. The first
reaction may be achieved by the direct introduction of
chlorine or via chlorination of the polyolefin prior to
reaction with maleic anhydride. One consequence of these
"chlorine" routes is an unavoidable residual amount of
chlorine in the final product, particularly when making a
product having a high succination ratio using an excess of
chlorine and maleic anhydride. The amounts of such residual
chlorine are not large, generally in the range of 1000-5000
ppm, and hitherto have been quite acceptable from a 
practical and commercial standpoint. However, increasing
environmental pressures are creating a demand for
lubricating compositions with a reduced or negligible amount
of residual chlorine, and this criterion cannot easily be
met with polyolefin-succinic derivatives produced wholly by
the chlorine routes.An alternative to the "chlorine" routes is the so-called
"thermal" route in which the polyolefin and maleic
anhydride are heated together, optionally in the presence of
a catalyst. This process avoids chlorine residues (except
for those present as impurities in the reactants and the
catalyst, if used) but tends to be inconveniently slow, with
a lower conversion of polyolefin, and also to result in the
formation of undesirable amounts of tarry by-products (often
referred to as "polymala"). An additional handicap of the
thermal route is the difficulty of
