<ABSTRACT>
This device, which close to one of the ends of the assembly (1) has means (3) for fastening this assembly on the rest of the vehicle (2) and close to the other end of the latter has means (4) for clamping this assembly onto the rest of the vehicle, in order to mount the assembly under stress on the rest of the vehicle, is characterised in that the clamping means (4) are located close to that end (5) of the column assembly which is designed to receive the steering wheel and are designed axially to urge this assembly in translation with respect to the rest of the vehicle, and in that the fastening means are provided close to the other end of the column assembly and are in the form of fastening means which use an axial wedging effect, the directions of engagement of the fastening means and direction of clamping of the clamping means being the one same direction.

A device for fixing a steering column assembly (1) to the 
rest of the structure (2) of a motor vehicle, comprising 

clamping means (4) near the end (5) of the steering column 
assembly adapted to receive the steering wheel and, near the 

other end thereof, means of attaching (3) the steering 
column assembly to the rest of the vehicle structure, in 

order to mount the column assembly under stress on the rest 
of the vehicle structure by stressing the steering column 

assembly at the time the clamping means are clamped, 
characterised in that the attaching means (3) take the form 

of means having an axial wedging effect, in that the 
engaging directions of the attaching means (3) and the 

clamping means (4) are the same and in that the clamping 
means (4) are adapted to cause an axial stress on the 

steering column assembly (1) translated in relation to the 
rest of the vehicle structure in order to generate the axial 

wedging effect of the attaching means and the mounting under 
stress of the assembly on the rest of the vehicle structure, 

consecutively to the clamping or the clamping means. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
attaching means having an axial wedging effect comprise at 

least one wedge-shaped member (6) linked to one of the 
elements, steering column
 assembly or rest of the vehicle 
structure and adapted to cooperate with a corresponding 

recess (8) in the other element, rest of the vehicle 
structure or steering column assembly. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
attaching means (3) comprise two wedge-shaped members 

arranged on either side of the steering column assembly,  
 

each member being adapted to cooperate with a corresponding 
recess. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
elastically deformable means are arranged between the or 

each wedge-shaped member and the corresponding recess. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
elastic means are formed by a sleeve (10). 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
elastic means are formed by tongues (11) extending into the 

recess.
