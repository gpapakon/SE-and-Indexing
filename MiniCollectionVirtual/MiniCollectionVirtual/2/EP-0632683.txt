<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer rigid-flex circuit board having 
two or more conductive layers, with at least one rigid 

circuit board (70,80) electrically connected to at least one 
flexible jumper connector (75) or intercircuit connector 

circuit board, is disclosed. A conductive layer (71,82) of each 
of the rigid circuit boards (70,80) is connected electrically 

and mechanically to a conductive layer (76) of the flexible 
jumper connector (75) by an interconnecting adhesive layer (85,90). 

The interconnecting adhesive layer (85,90) comprises a 
conductive adhesive material having a plurality of 

deformable, electrically conductive particles (87,92) dispersed 
substantially throughout a non-conductive adhesive (86,91). The 

fabricated multilayer circuit boards have 
interconnections which are reliable, heat resistant, and 

capable of withstanding the mechanical strain of the 
interconnection and the thermal cycling and typical circuit 

board fabrication, finishing and assembly processes. Such 
a rigid-flex circuit is typically used in an environment 

where space is limited. During installation, the flexible 
connector (75) is generally bent to adapt to the dimensional 

constraint of the surroundings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to multilayer 
electronic circuits. More particularly, the present 
invention is directed to rigid electronic circuit boards 
connected to a flexible circuit board or jumper 
connector where the corresponding conductive layers of a 
rigid circuit board and the flexible circuit board are 
mechanically and electrically connected by a layer of 
anisotropic electrically conductive adhesive. At one time individual active and passive 
components were interconnected on a surface of a single 
circuit board by metal leads, wires and conductive 
traces. Today, as electronic systems require greater 
speed and complexity in smaller and smaller packages, 
printed circuit designers have been encouraged to 
develop printed circuit boards having greater circuit 
densities. Much of the early advances in printed 
circuit technology involved reductions in scale, such as 
by decreasing the line thicknesses for conductive 
traces, combining multiple functions on integrated 
circuit chips, and directly mounting integrated circuit 
chips through leaded and surface mounting processes. Further development of printed circuit 
technology involved the creation of double-sided circuit 
boards and multilayered boards. These circuit boards 
typically comprise two or more conductive layers 
fabricated on one or more insulating substrate layers. 
The circuit layers are then connected by means of 
conductors (plated through holes) passing through the 
insulating layers. While early double-sided boards used 
insulating layers made of a rigid resin or ceramic 
material, many printed circuit boards in use today  
 
employ flexible substrates, typically made of a 
polyester or polyimide material. However, a circuit board needs to be connected 
to other boards or electronic devices, power supply, 
etc. Initially such connections were done by point to 
point wiring. As the number of connections in a circuit 
board that need to be connected to points outside the 
board increase, more sophisticated interconnectors were 
needed. Devices such as ribbon wire connectors were 
utilized for such connections. In a system with many 
circuit boards and interconnectors for connecting the 
circuit boards, it is desirable for the interconnectors 
to be flexible. The flexibility of the interconnectors 
improves reliability of the interconnected circuit 
boards and facilitates the handling of the boards during 
installation and repair. These flexible interconnectors 
lower the risk of incorrect wiring and reduce damages on 
the
