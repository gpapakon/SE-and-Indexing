<ABSTRACT>
Coin transporting apparatus for conveying coins along a transport path (8). The apparatus includes an endless belt (1) including sets of mechanical locators (20A, 20B) for locating a coin on the belt. Suction is conveyed through apertures (21) in the belt to hold a coin against the belt. The transport path (8) extends vertically or in a direction with a vertical component such that coins not held on the belt will drop away during movement along the transport path.

<DESCRIPTION>
COIN TRANSPORTING APPARATUS AND COIN VALIDATION APPARATUSEMPLOYING SAME The present invention relates to coin transporting apparatus and to coin validation apparatus employing such coin transporting apparatus.Coin transporting apparatus can be used in many different situations. For example to transport coins for the purpose of counting the total value of a quantity of coins or to split a quantity of coins into preset batch values. Such apparatus can also be used where there is a quantity of coins of mixed denominations to be sorted into quantities of the same denomination for putting into coin bags or the like and/or to transport the coins to a sensing station in order to respectively determine the presence of non-legal tender, for example foreign coins or tokens. The aforementioned can be combined in one apparatus.Known coin transporting apparatus use a rotary wheel having a series of indentations in the edge thereof to collect a coin and transport the coin stepwise to a suitable sensing/validation/counting station by means of rotation of the wheel. Another known apparatus has the coins provided on a plane the coins being guided by a blade or the like to an outlet where each coin is individually split off for sensing/validation/counting. By use of different blades, an element of preliminary sorting can optionally be introduced.One of the problems with the aforementioned apparatus is that the throughput of coins is relatively slow. Whilst it is possible to speed up the movement of the coins, the possibility of jamming or incorrect or incomplete location of the coins limits the speed of movement of the coins.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, coin transporting apparatus comprises conveying means for conveying coins along a transport path, the conveying means including mechanical locating means for locating a coin on the conveying means; whereby coins correctly located by the mechanical locating means are held 

against the conveying means under an applied force, the orientation of the conveying means being such that in the absence of sufficient applied force the coin will drop away during movement along the transport path. Preferably, the transport path extends vertically or in a direction with a vertical component such that coins not held on the conveying means will drop away during movement along the transport path.We have devised a new type of coin transporting apparatus in which coins are conveyed along a transport path while being held in place by a combination of the mechanical

CLAIMS
1. Coin transporting apparatus comprising conveying means for conveying coins along a transport path, the conveying means including mechanical locating means for locating a coin on the conveying means; whereby coins correctly located by the mechanical locating means are held against the conveying means under an applied force, the orientation of the conveying means being such that in the absence of sufficient applied force the coin will drop away during movement along the transport path.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the transport path extends vertically or in a direction with a vertical component
3. Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the transport path extends in a direction with a vertical component at an acute angle to the vertical such that incorrectly located coins drop off the conveying means.
4. Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein coins are transported at an angle less than or equal to 10Â° to the vertical.
5. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the conveying means includes an endless belt entrained around rollers, the belt carrying one or more sets of mechanical locating means, each set associated with an aperture for communicating suction through the belt.
6. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, wherein sets of mechanical locating means are provided spaced apart along the conveying means in the direction of the transport path. 7. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the transport path defines a number of parallel subsidiary paths laterally spaced apart across the conveying means each having sets of mechanical locating means spaced apart in the transport direction. 8. Apparatus according to claim 7, wherein mechanical locating means in adjacent subsidiary transport paths are relatively offset in the transport direction. 


9. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the mechanical locating means comprise a number of projecting studs arranged in a U- or V-shape.
10. Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the mechanical locating means comprise a pair of flanges arranged in a V-shape.
11. Apparatus according to at least claim 5, wherein the mechanical locating means comprise recesses in the belt.
12. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising a coin supply system for supplying coins to the conveying means.
13. Apparatus according to at least claim 5, wherein a lower roller around which the endless belt is entrained has a number of discs laterally spaced apart by an amount sufficient to accomodate the largest dimension of coin which is to be processed and in alignment with the sets or a respective group of sets in the transport direction, of the mechanical locating means.
14. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising wiper means cooperating with the conveying means to dislodge incorrectly held coins.
15. Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising suction means for generating the applied force. 16. Apparatus according to claim 15, wherein part of the transport path is curved.
17. Coin discriminating apparatus comprising coin transporting apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, and coin discriminating means for discriminating coins transported by the conveying means along the transport path.
18. Apparatus according to claim 17, further comprising a coin sorting means for removing a coin from the conveying means and supplying it to a predetermined location in dependence upon the discrimination of that coin by the coin discriminating means. 


19. Apparatus according to claim 18, wherein the coin sorting means comprises one or more pusher members which can be selectively actuated to push a coin off the conveying means towards the predetermined location. 20. Apparatus according to claim 19, when dependant on claim 15, wherein, where the conveying means includes apertures for communicating suction, the or each pusher member is actuated in use to extend through the appropriate aperture. 21. Apparatus according to claim 19 or claim 20, wherein the pusher member has a spring at its leading end. 22. Apparatus according to any of claims 19 to 21, wherein the pusher member is solenoid actuated and preferably comprises a solenoid operated plunger. 23. Apparatus according to any of claims 18 to 22, wherein the coin sorting means sorts coins in use into more than one predetermined location.
