<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a chalcopyrite 
structure semiconductor thin film containing a specific 
dopant. The chalcopyrite structure semiconductor is a 
material useful for constituting light-emitting devices 
and solar cells, because its forbidden band can be wide 
from a visual region to an infrared ray region and it has 
a large optical absorption coefficient due to the 
constituent elements. It is indispensable to produce a p-n 
junction in manufacturing the solar cells or light-emitting 
devices. For controlling a p-n conduction type 
of the chalcopyrite thin film, a method of changing the 
composition ratio between a Group I element and a Group III 
element or between a Group II element and a Group IV 
element which are the constituent elements of chalcopyrite 
compounds has been used conventionally. For example, in 
the case of CuInSe2 thin film, the n-type is formed when the 
proportion of the Group I element Cu is less than that of  
 
the Group III element In, and in the opposite case the p-type is 
formed. In these cases, a problem is encountered in that 
many lattice defects occur due to deviations in the 
composition ratio. There are also such problems as 
depositions of excessive amounts of components or the appearance of an 
impurity phase other than the chalcopyrite structure. R. 
Noufi et al., also report that it is difficult to control 
the carrier concentration and resistivity by changing the 
composition ratio (Appl. Phys. Lett., 45 (1984) p.688). 
Particularly, most of the chalcopyrite semiconductor thin 
films which go in the direction of the n-type by deviation in the 
composition ratio show a high resistance, and thus a low 
resistance film is not obtainable. In fabricating the p-n junction by using the 
chalcopyrite thin film produced by the prior art, such 
inconveniences as the lattice defects and depositions of 
excessive amounts of components owing to deviations of composition 
ratio, or the impurity phase other than the chalcopyrite-structure 
appear as mentioned before. Thereby, 
electrical and optical characteristics of the chalcopyrite 
thin film are deteriorated. Thus, when the devices having 
the p-n junction are manufactured by using the 
chalcopyrite thin film produced by the prior art, 
efficiency of the devices are inferior due to the 
deterioration of electrical and optical characteristics. 
For example, by increase of carrier recoupling centers due  
 
to the lattice defects and the impurity phase, the open-circuit 
voltage
