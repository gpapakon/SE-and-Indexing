Process for authorising selectively the 
end-to-end welding of two tubular parts of 

plastics material by means of an automatically 
controlled machine, in which process: 


- a) an identification code that can be 
read by reading means (25) of the machine is 

associated with each of the parts (7, 9); 
- b) data relating to at least some of 
the following characteristics are entered in an 

order and at determined positions of each code: 

b
1
) thickness and outside diameter of the 
part concerned, at its end where it is to be 

welded substantially coaxially with the other 
part; 
b
2
) temperature, or temperature range, 
corresponding to that to which an electrical 

heating element (5) has to he heated in order for 
the said part to reach, at its abutment end, the 

softening temperature suitable for it to be 
welded; 
b
3
) time interval during which the said 
part has to be placed in contact with the heating 

element; 
b
4
) time interval during which the said 
part has to be pressed against the other part;  

 
b
5
) pressure, or pressure range, 
corresponding to that to which the part has to be 

subjected during the time interval according to b
4
; 
b
6
) type of plastics material forming the 
part; and 
b
7
) index, or index range, of plasticity 
of that material; 
- c) the data of the codes are acquired 
by means of the reading means (25); 
- d) the machine is caused to make a 
comparison between the codes, datum by datum; 
- e) if, respectively, the acquired data 
relating to the characteristics b
1
) to b
7
) of the 
two codes correspond two by two, a compatibility 

between codes is recognised and a series of values 
common to the two parts is determined, those 

values relating, respectively, at least:
 
   to the heating temperature T to which the 

heating element (5) has to be heated so that the 
parts (7, 9) attain, at their abutment end, the 

softening temperature suitable for them to be 
welded;
 
   to the time t
1
 during which the parts are 
to be placed in contact with the heating element;
 
   to the pressure P to be exerted on at 

least one of the parts in order to press them 
against one another; and
  
 

   to the time t
2
 during which this contact 
pressure between the parts has to be maintained; 
f) and this series of values is supplied 
to the welding programme associated with the 

machine in order to authorise the welding of the 
parts as a function at least of the values 

determined according to e). 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that: 


a memory which comprises at least two 
compatibility tables relating, respectively, to 

the type of material and to the index, or index 
range, of plasticity of the parts to be welded, 

and which authorises, in accordance with 
predetermined criteria, given compatibility 

recognitions between the parts, even if the 
indices, or ranges of indices, of plasticity and 

the types of material are not identical for the 
two codes, is associated with the machine; 
and, during stages d) and e), the 
correspondence of the indices, or ranges of 

indices, of plasticity and type(s) of material is 
checked from one code to another, taking into 

account the compatibility criteria of the tables. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that:  

 

for at least some of characteristics b
1
) 
to b
5
), digital values, or ranges of values, 
relating to those characteristics and peculiar to 

the part concerned are entered in each code; 
during stage e), these values or value 
ranges of the two codes are compared; 
and if, except for predetermined 
tolerances, the values or value ranges are 

identical or overlap, in the case of the ranges, 
at least the series of above-mentioned values 

common to the two parts (t
1
, t
2
, P, T) is 
determined. 
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the series of values common 

to the two parts (t
1
, t
2
, P, T) is determined by 
calculating average values, on the basis of the 

values or overlapping value ranges which 
correspond, in the codes, to the characteristics 

b
1
) to b
5
) concerned. 
Process for welding selectively, end to 
end, two tubular parts of plastics material by 

means of an automatically controlled machine, in 
which process: 


stages a) to f) according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4 are carried out;  

 
after aligning the abutting ends of the 
parts (7, 9), and if the compatibility of the 

codes has been recognised in stage e), the heating 
element (5) which has been heated beforehand to 

its determined heating temperature T is interposed 
between the parts; 
the parts are brought into contact with 
the heating means (5) for the determined time 

interval t
1
; 
the heating means (5) is then caused to 
be withdrawn; 
the two softened abutment ends of the 
parts are then brought into contact with one 

another, at the determined welding pressure P, the 
application of this pressure being maintained for 

the determined time interval t
2
; 
the parts are then allowed to cool in 
order to achieve the welding thereof. 
Process according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that there are associated with 

the machine: 

means (51, 59) for delivering to the 
heating element (5) a determined voltage and/or 

intensity enabling the criteria of temperature T 
and pressure P to be met; and 
means (42) for detecting the 
temperature of the parts at the beginning of the  

 
welding operation, before the operation of 

aligning the abutment ends of the parts is carried 
out, the detected temperature of the parts being 

transmitted to means (39, 41) for implementing the 
welding programme in order to adapt the duration, 

voltage and/or intensity of the electric current 
applied to the heating means (5), as a function of 

the detected temperature of the parts. 
Process according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that: 


at least some of the data b

relating to the grouped data are stored is 

associated with the machine; 
on the basis of these value scales, the 
values corresponding to each of the data grouped 

under the standard reference are attributed for 
each code; 
in stage e), the attributed values are 
compared code by code; and 
if the values correspond, the 
temperature, pressure and time values common to 

the two parts are determined by calculating 
average values. 
Process according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that: 


at least some of the data b
1
) to b
5
) are 
grouped in each code (21, 23) under a determined
