<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to psyllium-containing drink mix 
compositions comprising small particle size psyllium husk, acid and 
base. These compositions have reduced or eliminated flavor impact but, 
in spite of the elevated pH, still have reduced gellation rates. Products containing larger particle size psyllium seed husk with 
citric acid and carbonate salts (e.g., potassium bicarbonate; sodium 
bicarbonate; and/or calcium carbonate) are known, for example Effervescent 
MetamucilÂ® sold by The Procter & Gamble Company (Physicians 
Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, 10th Edition, page 642; 
copyright 1989). These Metamucil products generate carbon dioxide upon 
mixing with water, which assists in the mixing process. The resulting 
product has a distinct tart/sour taste which is compatible with the 
flavors used (lemon-lime; orange). 
CA-A-2 030 448 describes a psyllium drink mix composition comprising psyllium 
husk, edible acid and edible base. 
US 4,824,672 describes a pharmaceutical composition for use in reducing serum 
cholesterol levels which contain gel-forming fibers and a mineral salt  
 Through attempts to produce an unflavored drink mix version of 
smaller particle size psyllium husk, it was realized that while readily 
mixable and suspendable compositions can be prepared, the rate of 
gellation for such compositions are unacceptably rapid when the acidic 
flavoring agents were not included. Reducing this gellation rate is 
particularly desirable for consumer acceptability when smaller particle 
size psyllium husk is used in a drink mix composition, for example when 
preparing small particle size drink mix compositions as described in 
European Patent Application Publication No. 362,926, published April 
11, 1990 by The Procter & Gamble Company (incorporated by reference 
herein in its entirety). However, this need for stronger/higher levels 
of acids to reduce gellation rate for such compositions substantially 
limits the choices of flavor systems for such compositions. Thus, there continues to be a need for reduced flavor and unflavored 
psyllium-containing drink mix compositions which have slowed 
gellation rates relative to the gellation rate of small particle size 
psyllium alone in solution. The present invention compositions satisfy 
this need. It has surprisingly been discovered by the present invention 
that including base with these small particle size psyllium-containing 
drink mix compositions not only reduces/eliminates the 
flavor impact of the composition but still,
