<ABSTRACT>
An air conditioning system for a motor vehicle powered by
an internal combustion engine (1) has a first system for carrying out

a first cycle, which includes a compressor (2) driven by the engine (1), a
main condenser (3), a first sub-condenser (13) and an evaporator (14) which

are connected through pipes to form a first refrigerant circulation
circuit through which a refrigerant flows from an outlet of the

compressor (3) to an inlet of the same while changing its phase, the
first cycle causing the first sub-condenser (13) as a heater and the

evaporator (14) as a cooler when operated. The air conditioning
system has further a second system for carrying out a second

cycle, which includes the compressor (3) and a second sub-condenser (22)
which are connected through pipes to form a second

refrigerant circulation circuit through which the refrigerant flows
from the outlet of the compressor (3) to the inlet of the same while

changing its phase, the second cycle causing the second sub-condenser (22)
as a heater when operated. First (11) and second (21)

independent air flow passages are defined. The first passage (11) has
the heater core (12), the first sub-condenser (13) and the evaporator (14)

installed therein, and the second passage (21) has the second sub-condenser (22)
installed therein. A sub-evaporator (8) is arranged in the

pipe extending from an outlet of the second sub-condenser (22) to an
inlet of the compressor (3). A cooling water circuit is arranged

through which engine cooling water of the engine (1) is fed to the
sub-evaporator (8) to carry out heat exchange between the engine

cooling water and the refrigerant flowing in the pipe. A control
device is arranged to control, when the second system is under

operation, the flow of engine cooling water directed to the sub-evaporator
in accordance with a load of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air conditioning system comprising: first means for carrying
out a first cycle, which includes a compressor driven by the engine, a main condenser, a first
sub-condenser and an evaporator, which are connected through pipes to form a first refrigerant
circulation circuit through which a refrigerant flows from an outlet of said compressor to an inlet
of the same while changing its phase, said first cycle causing said first sub-condenser as a
heater and said evaporator as a cooler when operated; second means for carrying out a
second cycle, which includes said compressor and a second sub-condenser which are
connected through pipes to form a second refrigerant circulation circuit through which said
refrigerant flows from the outlet of the compressor to the inlet of the same while changing its
phase, said second cycle causing said second sub-condenser as a heater when operated;
switch means for switching said first and second means; a heater core; a sub-evaporator
arranged in the pipe extending from an outlet of said second sub-condenser to an inlet of said
compressor; a cooling water circuit through which engine cooling water of said engine is fed to
said sub-evaporator to carry out heat exchange between the engine cooling water and the
refrigerant flowing in said pipe. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with an
automotive dual air conditioning system of double function type.Hitherto, various types of air conditioning systems have been proposed for instance in the
document US 5,228,301, and put into practical use particularly in the field of motor vehicle.
Some are of the above-mentioned double function type.In long body passenger cars, such as one-box type car or
the like, there has been widely used a so-called dual air
conditioning system which comprises a first air conditioning unit
for conditioning air fed to a relatively front portion of a passenger
room and a second air conditioning unit for conditioning air fed to
a relatively rear portion of the passenger room.Nowadays, for obtaining various advantages expected when
combined, some of the dual air conditioning systems employ the
principal of the system of double function type. That is, for
example, the first air conditioning unit comprises a first
evaporator constituting part of a closed refrigerant circuit of an
air conditioning system of double function type and a heater core
fed with engine cooling water, and the second air conditioning
unit comprises a second evaporator connected to the
