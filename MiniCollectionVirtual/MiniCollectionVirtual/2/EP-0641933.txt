<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a dosing device (metering device, proportioning device) which is distinguished by a reduction in the clearance volume and which permits permanent metering of a defined amount of an additive liquid to a main liquid, metering being effected at a precisely defined time which is determined by the consumer (load, user). To this end, a dosing device for the purpose of metering an additive liquid into the injection point of a main liquid line, comprising a metering piston which is designed as a plunger and is linked to a drive device and a control device, the metering piston plunging into a pump chamber which can be connected, on the inlet side, via a suction line being equipped with a suction valve, to a reservoir for the additive liquid and, on the outlet side, via a discharge line being equipped with a discharge valve, to the injection point, is characterised in that at least one of the valves (8, 11) and the corresponding line (9, 10; 12) is arranged inside the metering piston (5) and in that the dosing device (1) is controlled by a flowmeter device (25, 34, 35) through which the mixture of additive liquid and main liquid is supplied to at least one consumer (40, 41).
