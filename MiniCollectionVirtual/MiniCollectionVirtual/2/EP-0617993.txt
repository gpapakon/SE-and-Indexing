<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a kieselguhr-base microfilter disc, in particular for the complete sterilisation of water, the microfilter disc containing portions of at least two silicate-bound kieselguhr types, of which at least one is precalcined and later fired. The microfilter disc preferably has pore sizes in the order of magnitude of 0.1 to 0.3  mu , as a result of which bacteria can be reliably mechanically retained. A process using three different kieselguhr types and kaolin in combination with careful drying and subsequent firing makes possible the production of discs having a diameter greater than 35 cm and a thickness of 1 to 1.5 cm. Such discs can easily be mechanically abrasively cleaned by rotating brushes so that they make possible simple construction of a self-cleaning filter device. Filter arrangements thus constructed are low in maintenance and, because of the simplicity of the filter elements, can also be maintained by non-specialists.
