<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to exterior longitudinal beams (1) for twin axle railway goods wagons which are designed to transmit the horizontal buffer forces and to receive the vertical load of the freight and have the devices for bearing the axles (3). The object of the invention has been to provide an exterior longitudinal beam (1) for twin axle railway goods wagons, which beam (1) consists of simple components which can be manufactured economically and permits a simple and economical arrangement of the necessary crossbeams, which reduces the noise emission of the running gear and improves the aerodynamic properties in the underframe area. This object is achieved in that the exterior longitudinal beam (1) consists continuously from the headstock (2) to the headstock (2) of the railway goods wagon exclusively of multiply edged sheet metal with the same wall thickness. Here, the exterior longitudinal beam (1) has a joint-free cross-section. The exterior longitudinal beam (1) is also of three-level design at its upper longitudinal side, the uppermost level (6) forming the loading level, the central level (7) being the support surface for the floor covering (8) and the lower level (9) forming the support surface for crossbeams (10) of the railway goods wagon.

<CLAIMS>
Side sills for 2-axle railway goods wagons, which 
are designed to transmit the horizontal buffer forces and 

to accept the vertical load of the cargo and which 
support devices for the mounting of the axles, characterized 

in that the side sill (1) consists of a single metal 
sheet of uniform wall thickness bent a number of times 

and extending continuously between the buffer beams (2) 
of the railway goods wagon. 
Side sill according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the side sill (1) is of joint-free construction in 

cross-section. 
Side sill according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that, at its upper longitudinal end, the side 

sill (1) is designed with three steps, the topmost step 
(6) forming the loading plane, the central step (7) 

forming the support for the floor covering (8) and the 
bottom step (9) forming the support for cross members 

(10) of the railway goods wagon. 
Side sill according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the side sill (1) is designed with the same 

overall height over the axles (3) towards the buffer beam 
(2). 
Side sill according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that downwardly open cut-outs (13) are provided 

in the side sill (1) in the region of the axles (3) to 
accommodate the axle-box cases (14) of the axles (3), the 

cut-outs (13) being closable at the bottom in a known 
manner by means of an axle-guide web, and slideways being 

arranged on the vertical edges of the cut-out to provide 
longitudinal stops for the axle-box cases. 
Side sill according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that leaf springs (18) are arranged vertically on 

both sides of the cut-out (13), on the inside of the side 
sills (1), these leaf springs being clamped in non-positively 

at the top on the side sill (1) and being 
provided at a defined spacing in front of the side sill 

(1), in the region of the axle-box cases (14).
