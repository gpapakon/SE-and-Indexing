<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to compounds having affinity for certain cancer cells, e.g. lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, renal carcinomas, malignant melanomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas. The compounds also bind with high specificity to cell surface sigma receptors and can therefore be used for diagnostic imaging of any tissue having an abundance of cells with sigma receptors. The compounds are of general formula (I) wherein X is a radionuclide; R2 is -N(R3)2 or a 5 to 6 member nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one alkyl group; the remaining variables are defined on page 5 of the disclosure. Methods are provided for diagnostic imaging and for the detection and treatment of tumors containing the cancer cells described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOUNDS FOR CANCER IMAGING AND THERAPYFIELD OF THE INVENTION:The present invention relates to a class of compounds having particular affinity for a specific cell surface receptor prevalent on certain cancer cells, e.g. lung carcinomas, malignant melanomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, colon carcinomas, renal carcinomas and the like. In particular the present invention provides such compounds as agents for detecting and treating tumors, particularly tumors having cancer cells which possess a cell surface sigma receptor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:Lung carcinomas, malignant melanomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, colon carcinomas and renal carcinomas are aggressive forms of cancer, the early detection and treatment of which are of paramount importance. If left undetected or untreated for several years or even months the median survival time of patients having these types of cancers is dramatically reduced.Of these cancers, lung cancer has lead to the highest number of fatalities. In 1992 alone, lung cancer caused about 165,000 deaths within the United States. Two major types of lung carcinomas are responsible for most of these deaths: small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) .SCLC is a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes several peptide growth factors includingSHEET 

 bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (BN/GRP) . SCLC is responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but relapse occurs frequently, and the median survival time is only about one year. 5 NSCLC accounts for about 75% of all lung cancer cases and encompasses a variety carcinomas including adenocarcinomaε, large cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. NSCLC tumors secrete transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-σ) to stimulate _Q cancer cell proliferation. NSCLC is generally treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection. However the median survival time for patients with NSCLC is only about 5 years.Melanomas are among the most serious^ manifestations of skin cancer and lead to a greater number of fatalities than any other form of skin cancer. Melanomas can metastasize through the lymphatic system to regional nodes and then via the blood to secondary sites on the skin or in the liver, lungs and brain.20 Whereas the prognosis for superficial spreading melanoms can be quite good, there is a much poorer prognosis for nodular melanomas in which distant metastases frequently form.Many lives could be saved if lung carcinomas,25 melanomas, gliomas, neuroblastomas,
