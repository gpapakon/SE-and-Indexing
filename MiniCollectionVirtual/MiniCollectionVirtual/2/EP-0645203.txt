<ABSTRACT>
A soluble thermally cellulated, ceramic mold member, 
having gas evolved cells dispersed in a soluble crystalline 

matrix, the matrix consisting predominantly of at least one 
crystal phase selected from the group consisting of borates 

and phosphates of alkali metals, of divalent metals and of 
aluminum, and boron phosphate, and having at least one 

solubilizing agent selected from alkali metal compounds, 
divalent metal compounds and charred acrylic resin. A 

mixture capable of being thermally foamed to a cellulated 
body, the mixture consisting essentially of at least one 

phosphorous-containing compound, at least one boron-containing 
compound, at least one solubilizing agent 

selected from the group consisting of alkali metal 
compounds, divalent metal compounds and acrylic resins, at 

least one organic binder and a gas-evolving agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
A soluble, cellulated, ceramic mold and a thermally 
foamable mixture to produce the mold. Numerous techniques have been proposed for producing 
thermally cellulated bodies intended to be durable and 
resistant to attack from diverse materials e.g. glasses, 
ceramics and organic plastics, customarily by introducing 
gas into batch or granular mixture. For casting molten metals, such as iron, molds are 
commonly composed of sand grains mixed with an organic 
binder, such as pitch, which burns out during casting, and 
the mold readily breaks away from the casting. For certain intricate shapes, it has been proposed to 
use molds produced from granulated and bonded glass. Also, 
chemically machinable, glass-ceramic materials have been 
proposed as mold materials. Such molds are also removed 
mechanically. Recently, a technique has been proposed for forming 
glass bodies having a pristine surface that is free from 
mold marks molding the desired glass body with a surface 
layer of a relatively soluble glass. This soluble glass 
layer receives any mold marks, or other imperfections, and 
is dissolved away to leave the desired surface, see U.S.  
 
Patents 5,100,452 and 4,102,664. This procedure does not 
produce a cellulated body nor provide mold materials for 
casting. U.S. application 08/086,515, discloses an amorphous, 
polymeric material containing phosphorous, aluminum and 
carbon atoms, which may be thermally foamed at relatively 
low temperatures on the order of 300Â°C to produce a 
crystallized matrix having gas-filled, or vacuum-filled, 
cells dispersed throughout the matrix. The matrix may be 
essentially an aluminophosphate crystal phase or a mixture 
of alumino and borophosphate crystal phases. U.S. application 07/732,906, discloses a refractory 
body assembly. This assembly includes a barrier layer in 
an intermediate space between a refractory container and a 
honeycomb-type, refractory body positioned within the 
container. The barrier layer is a rigid, cellulated layer 
produced from the foamable material of the first mentioned 
application. There is no suggestion in these applications 
that the cellulated materials might be solubilized, or of 
the disclosed materials being suitable for use as mold 
materials. It would be desirable, and is an object of the 
invention to provide a light weight mold composed of a 
cellulated material capable of withstanding elevated 
temperatures such as encountered in casting processes. 
Such a material would be particularly useful if it could be 
readily
