<ABSTRACT>
Improved lithographic printing plates are 
comprised of an aluminum support, a hydrophilic barrier 

layer comprised of a copolymer of 40 to 90 mole percent 
vinylphosphonic acid and 10 to 60 mole percent 

acrylamide overlying said support, and an image-forming 
layer capable of providing a lithographic printing 

surface overlying said barrier layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the art 
of lithographic printing and in particular to 
lithographic printing plates having an aluminum 
support. More specifically, this invention relates to 
lithographic printing plates having a hydrophilic 
barrier layer interposed between the aluminum support 
and an image-forming layer which forms the lithographic 
printing surface. The art of lithographic printing is based 
upon the immiscibility of oil and water, wherein the 
oily material or ink is preferentially retained by the 
image area and the water or fountain solution is 
preferentially retained by the non-image area. When a 
suitably prepared surface is moistened with water and 
an ink is then applied, the background or non-image 
area retains the water and repels the ink, while the 
image area accepts the ink and repels the water. The 
ink on the image area is then transferred to the 
surface of a material upon which the image is to be 
reproduced, such as paper, cloth and the like. 
Commonly the ink is transferred to an intermediate 
material called the blanket, which in turn transfers 
the ink to the surface of the material upon which the 
image is to be reproduced. The type of lithographic printing plate to 
which the present invention is directed has a light-sensitive 
coating applied to an aluminum base support. 
The coating may respond to light by having the portion 
which is exposed become soluble so that it is removed 
in the developing process. Such a plate is referred to 
as positive-working. Conversely, when that portion of 
the coating which is exposed becomes hardened, the 
plate is referred to as negative-working. In both  
 
instances the image area remaining is ink-receptive or 
oleophilic and the non-image area or background is 
water-receptive or hydrophilic. The differentiation 
between image and non-image areas is made in the 
exposure process where a film is applied to the plate 
with a vacuum to insure good contact. The plate is 
then exposed to a light source, a portion of which is 
composed of UV radiation. In the instance where a 
positive plate is used, the area on the film that 
corresponds to the image on the plate is opaque so that 
no light will strike the plate, whereas the area on the 
film that corresponds to the non-image area is clear 
and permits the transmission of light to the coating 
which then comes more soluble and is removed. In the 
case of a negative plate, the converse is true. The 
area on the film corresponding to the image area is 
clear while the
