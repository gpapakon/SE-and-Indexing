<ABSTRACT>
A folding auxiliary seat assembly (1) for a tractor cab 
(2) includes a brace plate (4) pivotally connected to 

interior structure (9) of the cab, a main cushion (5) 
hingedly connected to the brace plate, and an outer 

cushion (6) hingedly connected to the main cushion. A 
latch pawl (33) extending from the brace plate 

cooperates with a spring latch (35) on a side wall of 
the interior structure to latch the assembly in a 

retracted position in which the outer cushion is folded 
beneath the main cushion, and the brace plate is pivoted 

to a vertical position. The main cushion has retainer 
sockets (39) formed on an underside thereof which are 

positioned to receive retainer pins (40) mounted on a 
top wall of the interior structure when the seat 

assembly is in a deployed position. In the deployed 
position, the outer cushion is folded out to a coplanar 

relationship with the main cushion, and the brace plate 
is angled away from the side wall of the supporting 

interior structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle seating and,
more particularly, to a folding auxiliary seat for an
enclosed tractor cab (see, for example, EP-A-0 430 905).Modern agricultural tractors are often provided with
enclosed cabs to reduce solar exposure to the driver, to
allow air conditioning which reduces driver fatigue, and to
protect the driver, to some degree, from air borne
pollutants such as dust and agricultural chemicals.
Although such tractors are generally designed as single
occupant vehicles with a seat for the driver only, it is
sometimes desirable for a passenger to ride in the cab of a
tractor. For example, it is often desirable for an
instructor to ride along with a first time driver of a
particular type of tractor or with a driver learning to
operate a particular type of soil working equipment.
Additionally, it might be convenient for an assistant or a
mechanic to ride along with a tractor operator to or from a
field being cultivated or during passes over the field.Conventionally, an extra rider in a tractor cab has no seat provided. Thus,
the rider must assume a crouched position, leaning against the interior of the cab,
such as a wheel well, in such a manner as to avoid interfering with the driver or
blocking his view. Such a position is usually uncomfortable and unsteady. Since
tractors are often driven over rough terrain, such a position can also be
hazardous to the rider and to the driver, if the rider should be thrown off balance
within the cab.EP-A-0 430 905 discloses an auxiliary tractor seat with a single cushion
member pivotably connected to a brace member. What is needed is a seating provision which allows a
rider in a tractor cab to sit in a secure, reasonably
comfortable position without interference to the driver and
which can be stowed when not needed.The present invention provides a retractable auxiliary
seat assembly for a tractor cab to safely and conveniently
accommodate a rider in the cab. The seat assembly includes
a brace plate which is pivotally connected to the interior
structure of the cab, a main seat cushion pivotally
connected to an outer end of the brace plate, and an outer
seat cushion hingedly connected to the main cushion.In a retracted position of the seat assembly, the
outer cushion is folded beneath the main cushion, and the
brace is pivoted to a vertical position to rest the main
cushion on the outer cushion and the outer cushion on a
horizontal seat support surface of the interior structure
of the cab. A brace latch on the brace plate engages a
catc

<CLAIMS>
A folding seat assembly (1) movably mounted on a seat
support including a vertical surface (11) and a

horizontal surface (10), the assembly further
including a brace member (4) having a lower end

pivotably connected to the vertical surface of the
seat support and having an upper end connected to a

cushion; the assembly characterized in that:

(a) said cushion is a first cushion member (5)
pivotally connected to said upper end of said

brace member; and including:
(b) a second cushion member (6) hingedly connected to
said first cushion member;
(c) in a retracted position of said assembly, said
second cushion member being pivoted to a position

beneath said first cushion member and said brace
member being pivoted to a position adjacent said

vertical surface of said seat support; and
(d) in a deployed position of said assembly, said
second cushion member being pivoted to a

substantially coplanar relationship with said
first cushion member and said brace member being

pivoted outwardly from said seat support, whereby
said first cushion member is Supported by said

brace member and said horizontal surface of said
seat support and said second cushion member is 

supported by said horizontal surface of said seat
support.
An assembly as set forth in Claim 1 including:

(a) a retainer (35,40) having portions positioned
respectively on one of said first and second

cushion members and on said horizontal surface of
said seat support and said portions being

releasably engaged in said deployed position to
thereby retain said brace member and the first

and second cushion members in said deployed
position.
An assembly as set forth in Claim 2 wherein said
retainer includes:


(a) a seat retainer pin (40) upstanding from said
horizontal surface of said seat support; and
(b) a socket (39) positioned on said first or second
cushion members to receive said pin in said

deployed position.
An assembly as set forth in any preceding claim
including:


(a) a brace latch (33,35) having parts mounted on at
least one of said braced 
member and said vertical
surface of said seat support and said latch parts

being releasably engaged in said retracted
position to releasably retain said brace member

and the first and second cushion members in said
retracted position.
An assembly as set forth in any preceding claim
wherein said seat support includes a horizontal

support member (10) with a vertical support member
(11) depending therefrom and wherein:


(a) said brace member (4) is connected to said
vertical member at a position which is spaced

from said horizontal support member;
(b) said brace member has a length whereby said
second cushion member (6) and at least a portion

of said first member (5) rest on said horizontal
support member in said deployed position; and
(c) said brace member has such a length and said
first and second cushion members have such

thicknesses that, in said retracted position,
said second cushion member rests on said

horizontal support member and said first cushion
member rests on said second cushion member.
An assembly as set forth in any preceding claim and
including:


(a) a seat belt (45) connected to said seat support
at a location to retain an occupant on said first

and second cushion member in said deployed
position.
An assembly as set forth in any preceding claim
wherein:


(a) said first (5) and second (6) cushion members
have such thicknesses and said brace member (4)

has such a length that, in said retracted 
position, said brace member is positioned

substantially vertically, said second cushion
member overlies at least a portion of said

horizontal surface (10) of said seat support
means, and said first cushion overlies said
