<ABSTRACT>
In the case of outlet boxes or connection boxes for busbars in low-voltage busbar trunking systems having mounting elements and having a housing which is divided by a partition wall into an equipment area and a connection area, a sliding cover covering either the equipment area or the connection area and being lockable by means of a locking device, it is intended to improve safety and, to be precise, this should be done irrespective of the reliability of the operator. This is achieved in that the mounting elements can be locked by means of a locking device, a bolt of the locking device engaging, when the mounting elements are in the unlocked position, behind the sliding cover in the locking manner. Furthermore, a protection device is provided, which consists of elements or probe fingers which can enter the retaining area between the connecting tab contacts, release the sliding cover when they enter said area and lock the sliding cover when they leave it.

<CLAIMS>
Distribution or connection cabinet (1) ) for bus bars in low-voltage bar distri 
butors with fixing elements and with a casing that is divided into an equipment 

compartment (14) and into a connection compartment (15) by means of a 
separating wall (13), with a sliding cover (18) covering either the equipment 

compartment (14) or the connection compartment (15) and being lockable by 
means of a blocking device (17), 
wherein
 the fixing elements (4) can be blokked 
by means of the blocking device (17) with one locking bar (73) of the blokking 

device (17) extending in a blocking way behind the sliding cover (18) in the 
unblocked position (figure 6c, 6d) of the fixing elements (4). 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein
 the locking 
bar (73) can extended into an opening (52) of an operating element (24) in 

order to operate the fixing elements (4), wherein the locking bar (73) is provided 
with a handle at its upper part, and is designed as a locking and operating 

lock (17). 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed in claims 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the 
locking bar (73) is subjected to spring pressure from two sides and extends 

both into the opening (52) and in a blocking way behind the sliding cover (18) 
(figure 6b) in the position of rest, and wherein the locking bar (73) is tiltable and 

can be hung up in the tilted position (figure 6c). 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed any of the above-mentioned 
claims, 
wherein
 the locking bar (73) can be displaced from the tilted position 
(figure 6c) into the vertical position (figure 6d) with the help of a reset edge (74) 

located on the operating element (24).  
 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed any of the above-mentioned 
claims, 
wherein
 the fixing elements (4) are designed as fastening bows which 
engage into a cavity (11) of the bar casing, wherein the fixing elements (4) turn 

or, respectively, swivel around and axis running in perpendicular direction with 
regard to the bottom of the distribution cabinet, and wherein the swivelling 

movement of the fastening bows is brought about by the eccentric location of 
the bearing point. 
Distribution or connection cabinet (1) for bus bars in low-voltage bar 
distributors, comprising in particular a blocking device (17) blocking the sliding 

cover (18) as claimed in claim 1, including a protective device (40) to prevent 
accidental contact with parts under voltage, and a casing that is subdivided into 

an equipment compartment (14) and a connection compartment (15) by means 
of a separating wall (13), with a sliding cover (18) covering either the equipment 

compartment (14) or the connection compartment (15), 
wherein
 the protective 
device (40) consists of elements which can be extended into the receiving room 

between the connection lug contacts (40) or of scanning fingers (70) which 
cause the sliding cover (18) to be blocked when they withdraw and to be released 

when they extend downwards. 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed in claim 6, 
wherein
 the plungable 
element or the scanning fingers (70) can be plunged by means of a turning 

movement. 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed in claims 6 or 7, 
wherein
 the 
plungable elements or the scanning fingers (70) are fixed at a U-shaped scanning 

element (49) with bow-shaped lateral legs arranged downward, while the 
lateral legs can rest upon a surface running in parallel with regard to the cover 

(9), and wherein the scanning fingers (70) are fixed at a scanning element, 
while the scanning element is movable via two bearing points (65, 66) arranged 

behind one another.  
 
Distribution or connection cabinet as claimed in any claim 6 through 8, 
wherein
 
the protective device (40) consists of a retaining profile (61) located approximately 

above the separating wall (13), of a blocking element (62) fixed in a swivelling 
way and including two lateral sections (63) and a transverse section (64), 

while the lateral sections (63) each have a cut (62) which presents an edge that 
blocks the sliding cover (18), an
d wherein a blocking element (62) of the protective 
device (40) presents an edge (50) which is rounded toward the inside in 

such a way that the sliding cover (18) ends vertically at the edge (50) in every 
blocked position.
