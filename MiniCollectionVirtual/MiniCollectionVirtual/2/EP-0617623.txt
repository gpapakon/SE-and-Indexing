<CLAIMS>
The use of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
acetylsalicylic acid for the production of a transdermal

system suitable for antithrombotic therapy, which system
contains the salts of acetylsalicylic acid in a matrix

which substantially suppresses the separation of the acetyl
group from the acetylsalicylic acid and which is free of

substances which, under storage conditions or when the
system is being used, effect the separation of the acetyl

group.
The use according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the system contains as active substance acetylsalicylic
acid in the form of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts,

and, in addition, free acetylsalicylic acid.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the system contains between 5 and 500 mg, preferably
between 30 and 200 mg, of a pharmaceutically acceptable

salt of acetylsalicylic acid in a stable form, this
indication of the amount being calculated on the free

acetylsalicylic acid.
The use according to one or more of claims 1-3,

characterized in that
 the system is present as a cream or
ointment.
The use according to one or more of claims 1-4,

characterized in that
 the system was produced by introducing,
in solid form or in solution or in dispersion, a

pharmaceutically effective amount of pharmaceutically
acceptable salts of acetylsalicylic acid and, optionally,

of free acetylsalicylic acid into the administration
system, optionally with addition of common additives. 
The use of acetylsalicylic acid for the production of
a transdermal system suitable for antithrombotic therapy,

which system contains the acetylsalicylic acid and/or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in a matrix which

substantially suppresses the separation of the acetyl group
from the acetylsalicylic acid and which is free of

substances which, under storage conditions or when the
system is being used, effect the separation, and the said

matrix containing, for suppression of hydrolysis, an
acylating agent, preferably an acetylating agent and, in

particular, acetic anhydride,
The use according to claim 6, 
characterized in that

the acetic anhydride is added in an amount of 0.01-3,
preferably 0.1-2%-wt, relative to the content of acetylsalicylic

acid.
The use according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in
that
 the system was produced by introducing, in solid form
or in solution or in dispersion, a pharmaceutically

effective amount of acetylsalicylic acid and/or of pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof into the administration

system, optionally with addition of common additives.
The use of one or more of claims 1-3 and 5-8,

characterized in that
 the system comprises an impermeable
backing layer, an active substance-containing reservoir

connected thereto and made of a polymer matrix, preferably
having an active substance concentration which is above the

saturation concentration, where other control mechanisms
are not present a membrane controlling the release of the

active substance, a pressure-sensitive adhesive device for
fixing the system to the skin, and, if required, a protective

layer detachable prior to application. 
The use according to one or more of claims 1-9,

characterized by
 employing means in the form of suitable
additives and/or electric current, which means enhance the

permeation of acetylsalicylic acid and/or of the pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof through the skin.
The use according to one or more of claims 1-10,

characterized in that
 the system is intended for human
medicine and, in particular, is present in the form of a

pressure-sensitive adhesive plaster.
