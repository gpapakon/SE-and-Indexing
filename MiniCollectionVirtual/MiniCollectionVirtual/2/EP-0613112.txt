<ABSTRACT>
A display holder (10) is formed from a main frame member 
that is a single extrusion. The main frame member includes 

opposite edge frame portions (28, 30) and a center panel (10). 
Frame portions (64, 66) snap onto the ends of a center panel 

(10) to complete a frame that extends entirely about the 
periphery of the display holder (10). The display holder (10) 

may be mounted by a mounting member (44) which includes a hinge 
strip (92). Hinge strip (92) and a pair of mounting member 

flanges (42, 90) may be made by a co-extrusion process. A 
rigid structural plastic is used to form the flanges (42, 90). 

A bendable, resilient plastic is used to form the hinge strip 
(96). The hinge strip (96) will bend in response to a side 

force applied to the display holder (10). Hinge strip (92) 
will act as a spring and will swing the display holder (10) 

back to its at rest position when the force is removed. A 
mounting member (118) may be used which includes a 

longitudinally split, tubular rib (130), with trunnions (136, 
138) inserted into the end portions of the rib (130). These 

trunnions (136, 138) may extend through aligned openings (152, 
156) and mount the display holder (10) for pivotal movement 

about a vertical axis. A plurality of display holders (10) may 
be mounted close together by use of the trunnions (136, 138) 

and the openings (152, 156).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to display holders for sign boards,
paint samples, etc. More particularly, it relates to the
provision of improved display boards which are adapted to be
mounted in a vertical orientation, by a structure which permits
a swinging movement of the sign board about a generally
vertical axis.The following United States patents show various types of
sign boards which are adapted to be mounted in a vertical
orientation: No. 1,559,010, granted October 27, 1925, to
George B. Schwieger; No. 1,793,563, granted February 24, 1931,
to Eugene Schwartz; No. 1,866,723, granted July 12, 1932, to
Howard C. Powers; No. 2,646,241, granted July 21, 1953, to
Robert E. McLean; No. 2,787,433, granted April 2, 1957, to
Robert J. Slavsky and John R. Slavsky; No. 3,529,798, granted
September 22, 1970, to Donald C. Williams and Richard G. Growe;
No. 4,574,507, granted March 11, 1986, to Paul G. Elliott; No.
4,616,799, granted October 14, 1986, to Hugo E. Rebentisch; No.
4,805,331, granted February 21, 1989, to Charles H. Boggess and
Richard G. Krautsack; No. 4,866,867, granted September 19,
1989, to Kenneth H. Clark; No. 4,881,707, granted November 21,
1989, to Benjamin L. Garfinkle; No. 4,909,464, granted
March 20, 1990, to Stanley L. Levine and Lee R. Wiese; No.
4,957,256, granted September 18, 1990, to Mary B. Boeding; and
No. 5,111,606, granted May 12, 1992, to Randy B. Reynolds.U.S. Patent No. 4,805,331 discloses a display holder that
is adapted to be mounted onto the front of a store shelf by a
structure which holds the display holder in a yertical
orientation and in a position that is generally perpendicular
to the front edge of a shelf, but which allows the display
holder to pivotally move out of the way of a customer or
article that strikes it. The display holder includes a bias
means which automatically returns it to its normal position 
when the force causing it to swing has been removed. This ensures
that the advertising message or display continuously remains in a direct
view of approaching customers. An object of the present invention is to
provide a display holder capable of performing the function of the
display holder disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,805,331, but which is
much simpler in construction.U.S. Patent No. 4,881,707 discloses a display holder similar to
the display holder disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 4,805,331, except it
includes a hinge comprised of a plurality of stria which are formed from
a flexible material such as thermoplastic elastomer. An object of the
present invention is to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vertically elongate store shelf display holder, comprising a
center panel (12) having two side faces (14, 16), two side edges (18,

20), a top edge (22) and a bottom edge (24); a first frame portion (28)
at the first side edge; a second frame portion (30) at the second side

edge; a third frame portion (64) at the top edge; a fourth frame portion
(66) at the bottom edge; said first and second frame portions forming

with the center panel a pair of vertically extending channels (50, 52 
&

60, 62) at the first and second side edges of the center panel, for
receiving mounting portions of a display; and at least one of said third

and fourth frame portions (64, 66) being removable to permit insertion
of a display into or removal of a display out from the channels, said first

frame portion (28) being provided with a flexible attachment means for
mounting the display holder on a store shelf.
A display holder as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the first frame
portion (28) and optionally also the second frame portion (30) are

integrally formed with said center panel (12).
A display holder as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the
third and fourth frame portions (64, 66) are detachable from the center

panel (12) and include channels for snugly receiving end portions of the
center panel (12).

said first edge frame portion is formed integral with the center panel and

comprises a base strip (32) which extends perpendicular to the center
panel, said base strip having opposite side edges, a first flange (34)

connected to the first side edge of said base strip (32), a second flange
(36) connected to the second side edge of the base strip (32), said

flanges both extending from the base strip (32) in a direction generally 
opposite the center panel, a first lip (38) extending laterally inwardly

portion (30) is also formed integral with the center panel (12) and

comprises a cap strip (54) including a pair of frame flanges (56, 58), on
opposite sides of the panel, extending in the same direction as the

center panel, each said frame flange being spaced from the center panel
so as to with the center panel form a vertically extending channel, with

each vertically extending channel of the second edge frame portion
confronting a vertically extending channel of the first frame portion.
A display holder as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5 wherein the
main member is formed by extrusion of a plastics material.
A display holder as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6 wherein each
said pair of channels (50, 52

member includes a second flange (130) spaced from the flange that is

received within said lipped channel, and a web interconnecting said
flanges, said web having a normal position in which it extends

substantially perpendicular to both flanges, said web being bendable and
resilient, so that the second flange can be anchored and the display

holder will swing in position relative to the second flange, in response to
a force applied against the display holder, perpendicular to the general

plane of the web, and in response to such force the web will bend, and
in response to a release of the force the web will resume its normal

position.

mounting unit is snugly received, and a flexible hinge strip between said

lipped channel and said display holder, said hinge strip being constructed
from a flexible plastic materials which will bend in response to a force

applied against the display holder, allowing the display holder to swing
in position, and will return the display holder to a normal at rest position

when the force is removed from the display holder.
A display assembly as claimed in Claim 13 wherein the mounting
member has upper and lower parts, each with a vertical wall, said

vertical walls sidelapping each other, said vertical walls including aligned
slots, and a screw fastener (162) extending through said slots and

engaging a nut (164), said screw fasteners and nut serving to hold the
two parts together, in a position in which they both engage the beam,
