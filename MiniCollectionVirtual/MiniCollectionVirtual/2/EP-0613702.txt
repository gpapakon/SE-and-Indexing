<ABSTRACT>
A cover for enclosing and supporting a bag such as 
a golf bag and/or including golf equipment. This cover 

is of a collapsible nature for easy and convenient 
storage and handling as compared with rigid covers, 

having pliant front rear, side, and top portions (12-16). 
The bottom of the cover has a rigid base (17) with wheels 

(32) mounted therein. An opening is provided in the 
cover to permit the insertion of a bag therein, this 

opening being closable by a suitable device such as a 
zipper (20). A handle is mounted on the bag to permit 

the user to roll the bag along on the wheels. When the 
bag is not in use, the side, front, rear and top portions 

can be folded down onto the base to make the cover 
compact for stowage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for containing 
golf clubs or the like and more particularly to such a 
device which has wheels to facilitate transportation. Various devices have been developed in the prior art 
to facilitate the transportation of golf clubs. These 
generally take the form of golf bags which have wheels 
attached thereto and are rigid or semi-rigid. Such bags 
are described in US 4,911,465 issued March 27, 1990 to 
Hauer and US 4,012,051 issued March 15, 1977 to 
Emblinder. Both of these bags have compartments for 
holding the various golf clubs in a set and are not 
collapsible. US 4,657,135 issued April 14, 1987 to Kjose 
describes a rigid or semi-rigid golf bag and container 
which is placed within a zippered flexible covering for 
transportation. While certain of the prior art devices described 
above are suitable for transportation when travelling, 
the covers are integrated with particular types of bags 
and are not suitable for transporting the type of bag 
which the user may normally use. A golfer often has a 
preference for a particular type of golf bag and may 
prefer to continue using the bag of his choice. Even if 
the golfer were willing to sacrifice the use of his 
preferred bag when travelling, it is inexpedient to have 
two bags, one for home use and one for travelling.  
 US 4951818 of 1990 discloses a golf equipment 
carrier having a plurality of soft pliable walls made rigid 
by removable plastic inserts and one rigid longitudinal 
wall having wheels mounted thereon at each end and at the 
centre for easy transportation. US 3316951 of 1967 
discloses a golf bag carrying case having two long, 
flexible side walls connected by a zip fastener and one 
rigid end wall. The cover of the present invention addresses the 
shortcomings of prior art golf bag covers and travel bags 
by providing a device for covering a bag or the like, 
comprising an openable, collapsible, wheelable container, 
having flexible front, rear, side and top portions and 
a rigid wheeled base portion characterised in that said 
rigid wheeled base portion forms substantially an entire 
end of the container, and has a substantially smaller 
surface area than either said front, rear or side 
portions, said front, rear and side portions being 
collapsible onto said base portion for storage. In an embodiment of the present invention a zipper 
is provided along one of the sides and top of the cover 
to facilitate opening and closing of the cover. A golf 
bag can be placed within the cover with its base
