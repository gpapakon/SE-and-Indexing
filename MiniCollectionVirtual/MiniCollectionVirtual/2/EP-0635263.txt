<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of 
Angiotensin (AII) Antagonists as inhibitors of the 
growth of adipose tissue, reducing adipocyte growth and 
body weight gain. Angiotensin is a well characterized peptide 
involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. For decades, 
angiotensin has been known to be a potent vaso-constrictor 
with profound effects on blood pressure and 
electrolyte balance. The classic concept of control of 
angiotensin metabolism via renin release from the 
kidney has more recently been revised to include 
peripheral tissue sites. The observation of 
significant quantities of locally generated angiotensin 
II (AII) from peripheral tissues has also coincided 
with data indicating that AII can act as a growth 
factor in cell culture systems and stimulate 
angiogenesis in vivo. Membrane receptors for angiotensin II have 
been identified in many tissues from diverse species 
and the gene encoding the receptor protein has recently 
been cloned. Two subtypes of receptor have been observed, 
the high affinity AT₁ subtype typically found  
 
in vascular cells, and the low affinity AT₂ subtype 
found in nervous tissue. The angiotensinogen gene has 
been identified by in situ hybridization in brown 
adipose tissue and whole body autoradiographic techniques 
have indicated that AII receptors decrease in 
specific tissues during fetal development. Presently, 
AII has been characterized as both a potent vasoconstrictor, 
and an effector of growth and differentiation. 
To date, however, the functions of AII in 
addition to those producing cardiovascular effects have 
been proposed, but remain largely unresolved. Adipose tissue is highly vascularized, and is 
one of the few tissues that can continue to expand 
through most of adult life. Angiotensinogen mRNA has 
been observed in whole adipose tissue preparations 
containing vascular, connective and fat cells, and 
isolated adipocytes incubated in the presence of 
exogenous angiotensin II release prostacyclin in a 
dose-dependent manner. In addition, for the first 
time, the receptor for AII in the rat fat cells has 
recently been identified, characterized in isolated 
adipocyte membranes and reported (D.L. Crandall et al., 
Metabolism, 42, 511-515(1993). The present invention relates to the 
identification of the AII receptor in adipocyte 
membranes and the use of angiotensin II receptor 
blocking agents to inhibit adipocyte AII receptors 
thereby reducing adipocyte growth and body weight gain. 
Accordingly, the invention also relates to the use of
