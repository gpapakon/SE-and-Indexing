<ABSTRACT>
In a double seat valve (1), the valve element (7; 107) is in one piece, the outside diameter dDO of the upper sealing means (9a) is greater than 1.1 times the outside diameter dTO of the upper valve plate (6a) and the outside diameter dDU of the lower sealing means (9b) is greater than 1.1 times the outside diameter dTU of the lower valve plate (6b), and the elastomeric sealing means (9a, 9b) are arranged on the underside of the two valve plates (6a, 6b). When the double seat valve is opened, the radial deformation or bending moment of the sealing means (9) resting on the valve seats leads to radial micromovements, and adhesion forces which counteract opening are thus reduced.

(6a, 6b; 106a, 106b) and the lower sides of the sealing 

means (9a, 9b; 109a, 109b) seat with a defined pressure 
on the upper or on the lower valve seat (4a, 104a; 4b, 

104b) respectively in the closed position of the 
double seat valve (1; 101) to prevent passage of the 

medium being sealed, wherein the outer diameter d
TO

valve seat (4a; 104a) and wherein the elastomeric 

sealing means (9a, 9b; 109a, 109b) extend outwardly in 
the radial direction beyond the two valve discs (6a, 

6b; 106a, 106b) and have an upper outer diameter d
DO
 or 
a lower outer diameter d
DU
 respectively which are each 
larger than the inner clearance diameter d
