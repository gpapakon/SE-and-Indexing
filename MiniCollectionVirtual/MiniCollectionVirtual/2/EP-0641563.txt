<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel agent comprising 
(+)-(2S,3S)-3[(S)-3-methyl-1-(3-methylbutylcarbamoyl)butylcarbamoyl]-2-oxiranecarboxylic 
acid (hereinafter referred 
to as E-64c), its salt (hereinafter referred to as E-64c salt) 
or its ethyl ester (hereinafter referred to as E-64d), which is 
useful for the treatment and prevention of cataract, and to a 
method for its preparation. Cataract is a disease where lens becomes opaque due to 
various factors, which comes out in the form of paropsis as a 
result of light scatter caused by the opacity of lens, since the 
scatter leads to an inability to form normal images on retina. According to the causes, cataract is classified into 
congenital cataract, senile cataract, complicated cataract, 
traumatic cataract, diabetic cataract, and so on, and besides 
these, radiation cataract, glassworker's cataract, etc. are also 
known, all of which constitute serious eye diseases which 
accompany lowered eyesight due to the opacity of lens. Cataract has so far been treated by the administration of 
various pharmaceutical agents such as antiquinoids (e.g. 
pirenoxine), agents involved in glutathione synthesis (e.g. 
cysteine), agents having an SH group (e.g. tiopronin), aldose 
reductase inhibitors (e.g. tolrestat), or the like. However,  
 
administration of these agents is not entirely satisfactory 
partly due to a markedly slow metabolism of lens. Consequently, 
the treatment of cataract is currently limited to surgical 
ones. The surgical treatment is given by translocation of the 
opacity within the eyeball, or enucleation of the entire lens 
out from the eyeball. The both methods are burdensome to 
patients in that incision and suture of cornea, and incisional 
wound of lens are inevitable even when operated with the use of 
the state-of-the-art surgery technique. What is causing cataract is still unknown, but oxidation, 
decomposition, and agglutination of crystalline protein are 
deemed to be concerned with the disease, and an increased 
amount of calcium has been observed in lenses which developed 
opacity [Invest. Ophthalmol., vol. 13, 204-209 (1974)]. It has been reported that trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)butane 
(hereinafter referred to as E-64) which is 
an inhibitor of calpain, a cysteine protease existing in lens 
which is activated by calcium, can prevent opacity of lens in 
selenite cataract models and diabetic cataract models of 
cultured rat lenses [Atarashii Ganka, vol. 6, 1573-1576 
(1989)]. Yet, E-64 has so weak an
