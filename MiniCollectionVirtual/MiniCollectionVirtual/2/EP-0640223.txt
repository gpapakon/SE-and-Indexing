at least one pair of adjusting structures (36), one pair

of fibre-guiding structures (14) and one opening (22) for
receiving a first waveguide (40), and which connects the

two fibre-guiding structures (14) to one another, in

b.) a polymer cover plate (34) is produced which has at
least one pair of adjusting structures (36), one pair of

fibre-guiding structures (14) and one opening (22) for
