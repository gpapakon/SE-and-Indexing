<DESCRIPTION>
 LASER DESORPTION IONIZATION MASS MONITOR (LDIM)BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates in general to methods of determining or monitoring the weight of organic molecules. It relates in particular to time of flight (TOF) measurement methods using laser desorption ionization of molecules to be measured.Time of flight methods of determining molecular weight are normally used for large molecules such as organic molecules (having a molecular weight greater than about 100,000 daltons) . Such molecules are generally so heavy that well known deflection mass spectrometricmethods are ineffective. In deflection mass spectrometry, ionized species are produced in a vacuum and passed through a magnetic field. The extent to which they are deflected by the magnetic field provides a measure of their weight. Large organic molecules may be sufficiently heavy in relationship to their charge (charge/mass ratio) that they are not readily deflected by a magnetic field. 

 Intime of flightmethods ofmass spectrometry, charged (ionized) molecules are produced in a vacuum and accelerated by an electric field into a time of flight tube or drift tube. The velocity to which the molecules may be accelerated is proportional to the accelerating potential, proportional to the charge of the molecule, and inversely proportional to the square of the mass of the molecule. The charged molecules travel, i.e. "drift" down the TOF tube to a detector. The time taken for the molecules to travel down the tube may be interpreted as a measure of their molecular weight.Laser desorption ionization mass monitoring is a TOF mass monitoring method wherein charged molecules of a species to be measured, or analyzed, are produced by laser irradiation (in vacuum) of a crystallinehost matrix including a small proportion, for example between about 1:1000 and 1:10,000 of the species. Irradiationwithultraviolet (UV) radiation is generally preferred. The host matrix is selected to optimally absorb and transfer the energy radiation to the analyte. The absorbed energy is transferred to the analyte which is ejected or desorbed from the matrix in the form of charged molecules (ions) . The desorbed, charged molecules arethen accelerated into a drift tube. The time of flight of the molecules throughthe tube is generally determined bydetecting the irradiating pulse and using the detected signal to start a timing process. Charged molecules generated by the irradiating pulse are intercepted by a detector after they have traversed the drift tube. A signal
