<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing aliphatic polysaccharides in which a slurry of a hydrous saccharide source in a first portion of aliphatic alcohol is introduced into a second portion of the aliphatic alcohol maintained at an elevated temperature and under a reduced pressure to form a mixture of saccharide source and alcohol with a reduced water content, introducing an acid catalyst into the mixture with the reduced water content and reacting the aliphatic alcohol with the saccharide source to form an aliphatic glycoside.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aliphatic glycosides have been known for at least
sixty years. They are nonionic surfactants with low
toxicity and gentleness to the skin. They can be made from
renewable resources and are rapidly degraded in the
environment.Thus, the present invention is directed to a method for making
aliphatic glycosides from a mixture of an alcohol and a
saccharide source with a reduced water content of less than 1%
by weight of water. Furthermore, the present invention relates
to a method for making said mixture with said reduced water
content.In spite of the excellent properties of the aliphatic
glycosides, they have not achieved great commercial
acceptance because of the difficulties encountered in their
production. Rohm & Haas corporation has been providing
alkyl glycosides in which the alkyl group is formed from a
mixture of fatty alcohols having 8 and 10 carbon atoms.
The compositions were sold under the trade name BG-10 and
CG-110. The BG-10 composition is a dark, almost black,
material and is used only in commercial formulations. The
CG-110 material is a light colored product having a
dissolved solids content of about 70%, which is useful for 
consumer applications.Early processes for the preparation of aliphatic
glycosides were two-step processes. The first step
comprised the reaction of a lower alcohol having 1 to 6
carbon atoms with a source of saccharide in the presence of
an acid catalyst to form the aliphatic glycoside. These
aliphatic glycosides do not have useful surfactant
properties. Since water is miscible with, or highly
soluble in, the alcohols, the reaction mixture can contain
substantial quantities of water (see U.S.-A-4,721,780). The
higher aliphatic glycosides in which the aliphatic group
contains from 7 to 22 carbon atoms, were prepared by
transacetalization of the lower glycosides with higher
fatty alcohols under substantially anhydrous conditions.More recently, aliphatic glycosides having alkyl
groups with from 7 to about 22 carbon atoms have been
prepared by a "direct process". In the "direct process" a
long chain fatty alcohol is reacted with a source of
saccharide in the presence of an acid catalyst under
conditions in which the water formed in the reaction is
removed as quickly as it is formed to maintain the water
content of the reaction mixture at as low a level as is
reasonably possible. The water formed in the reaction is
only slightly soluble in the fatty alcohol and any
undissolved water results in the rapid formation of
unwanted byproducts. The parameters of the "direct
process"
