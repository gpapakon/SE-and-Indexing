A mower-conditioner comprising a mower (1) suspended vertically
displaceable on a main frame (10) and a conditioner (2) following the mower

(1), adjustably linked to the main frame (10), 
characterised in that
 the
conditioner (2) is movably coupled to the mower (1) via at least one coupling

member (19).
A mower-conditioner according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the coupling
member is a pivot joint (19).
A mower-conditioner according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a joint
axis (20) of the coupling member (19) is arranged at a small distance from the

mower rotor (6).
A mower-conditioner according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the
coupling member has a sliding guide.
A mower-conditioner according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the
coupling member is an intermediate piece with separated joint axes, which

engages articulately both on the mower (1) and on the conditioner (2).
A mower-conditioner according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in
that
 the coupling member has ball joints.
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 on both sides of the mower (1) a coupling member (19)
is provided for the conditioner (2).
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of the preceding claims,


characterised in that
 the joint axis (20) of the coupling member (19) is
arranged parallel to the axis of rotation (15) of a conditioner rotor (14) of the

conditioner (2). 
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the conditioner (2) is pivotably linked to the main frame
(10) via at least one support element (21, 27), which is rotatably pivoted at one

end about at least one upper horizontal joint axis (22) on the main frame (10)
and, at the other end, about at least one lower horizontal joint axis (23) on the

conditioner (2).
A mower-conditioner according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the support
element is a single linkage rod arranged centrally on the conditioner (2).
A mower-conditioner according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in that
 the
support element is formed by two linkage rods (21) arranged in a distance side

by side.
A mower-conditioner according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the linkage
rods (21) are linked above by joints (29) with a support beam (27) which is

suspended by at least one joint (28) centrally on the main frame (10).
A mower-conditioner according to any one of claims 9 to 12, 
characterised in
that
 the conditioner (2) is jointed on the main frame (10) both able to swing
about an upper horizontal longitudinal central axis (31) and able to pivot about

a horizontal transverse axis (22).
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of claims 9 to 13,

characterised in that
 all couplings between main frame (10) and support
elements (21, 27) and between support element (21) and conditioner (2) are

designed as ball joints (28, 29, 30).
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 on raising of the mower (1) out of a normal working
position (3) into a yielding position (26), the conditioner (2) is pivoted relative

to the mower (1) in the direction of rotation (16) of the conditioner rotor (14). 
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of claims 9 to 15,

characterised in that
 the lower joint axis (23) of the support elements (21,
27) lies - seen in the direction of travel - behind the axis of rotation (15) of the

conditioner rotor (14).
A mower-conditioner according to one or more of the preceding claims 9 to 16,

characterised in that
 the lower joint axis (23) of the support elements (21,
27) and the axis of rotation (15) of the conditioner rotor (14) lie approximately

in one horizontal plane.
