<ABSTRACT>
A compressed gas storage tank (10) is fabricated to conform to the 
dimensions of a 

convenient and/or available space, such as under the floor of an automobile. The tank 
comprises a shell (11-16) having at least a portion (11,12,14,15) 

fabricated from a superplastically formable material. 
The superplastic material is bonded to internal structural support members (17,18) 

and the remaining 
portions (16) of the shell. Bonding may be achieved by known methods 

such as welding and/or 
diffusion bonding. The internal support members, which need not comprise superplastic 

material, are positioned internally to provide optimum resistance to gas pressure hoop 
stresses. 

In contrast to a thick-walled cylinder, the tank of the present invention may be formed 
into an 

irregular shape allowing the tank to fit, for example, under a large fraction of the floor 
of an 

automobile by conforming to the available space. The relatively low gas containment efficiency 
of such an irregular shape is reinforced by the strength and toughness of the shell material, 

the internal trusses, and stiffening beads or ribs (13) that together 
constrain the hoop stresses caused by the compressed gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tanks for storing compressed gas and, in particular, to a 
light weight compressed gas tank that can be fabricated to conform to a convenient and/or 
available space. Natural gas is among the leading contenders for fueling low emission automotive 
vehicles. The cost of purchasing and operating natural gas vehicles (NGVs) during the next 
decade is projected to be significantly lower than that for electric vehicles. With present 
technology, electric power for automotive vehicles is not economically competitive with the 
internal combustion engine. The development of technology related to compressed natural gas (CNG) for fueling 
NGVs has strong economic advantages, such as improving U.S. balance of trade by reducing 
requirements for oil imports, establishing self-sufficiency in energy needs, and creating new 
industries and jobs. Estimates indicate that the continental United States has a 200 year supply 
of recoverable natural gas, with procurement costs of CNG no greater than the wholesale cost 
of unleaded gasoline. Furthermore, NGVs achieve about the same number of miles per gallon 
as gasoline powered vehicles while incurring lower operating costs. CNG has the lowest overall emission profile of all fossil fuels. As a result, NGVs are 
essentially smoke-free, producing an invisible exhaust that contains virtually no particulates. 
Because natural gas has fewer heavy hydrocarbons, it burns more completely than gasoline or 
diesel fuel and produces only a fraction of the carbon monoxide. The primary hydrocarbon in 
the exhaust emissions of NGVs is CH₄, which does not react in the atmosphere to produce 
ozone. Test results indicate that NGVs can achieve emission levels below those defined for 
ultra-low emission vehicles. Clean-burning CNG-powered vehicles offer significant improvements in engine 
component wear. Pistons, piston rings, cylinder walls, and valve train components exhibit less  
 
wear because of reduced fuel dilution and reduced oil contamination from abrasive soot 
particles. The lean-burning CNG engines also operate at lower combustion temperatures, 
thereby reducing oil oxidation. The high octane rating (130) of CNG allows engine designs 
having high compression ratios for better performance and economy. As a result of these 
advantages, routine maintenance activities, such as oil changes, spark plug replacement, and 
tune-ups, are required less frequently on NGVs. All of these factors tend to yield lower 
maintenance costs and longer engine life for
