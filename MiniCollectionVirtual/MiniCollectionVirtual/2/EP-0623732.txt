<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to secure a roller or Venetian blind against unauthorised pushing-up from outside a building and to prevent the screen from falling downwards, as a result of its deadweight, after lowering has been hindered by an obstruction, to be precise this is to be achieved without additional manipulation. For securing purposes, in the case of a screen comprising parallel profile bars (3) which are interhung by means of carrying members and are guided in rails (21) located laterally on the window or door frame, use is made of a clamping device by means of which at least the lowermost profile of the screen can be fixedly clamped on the sides. Said clamping device is, by means of an articulation pin (14), rotatably suspended on the two carrying members (15), assigned to the profile bar (3) to be secured, in an elongate lug (4) in each case. The lug (4) is provided with a slot (7) into which a pin (6) of a locking lever (8) engages. The locking lever (8) bears, at a distance from the pin (6), on two opposite surfaces of a rail (21) by means of two braking jaws (9). Likewise provided for securing the blind against falling is a securing bar (31) which also has braking jaws (32, 33) made for sliding on the rails (21). A support (37) from the guide carriage (2) serves for horizontally positioning the securing bar (31) when the screen is drawn up, a band fastener (40) having a stop surface, with which the securing bar is raised.

Safety device for venetian blinds with hangings consisting of parallel lamellas
mutually suspended by means of lamella carriers (15), guided in rails (21) located

laterally in window and door frames and pivotally supported on laterally
connected lamella carriers (15) of which lamella carrier (15) the one which carries

the lowermost lamella is supported on a guide block (2) pivotally guided in lateral
rails (21), 
chracterized
 in that at least the lamella carrier allocated to the
lowermost lamella carrier (15) is equipped with a safety lever (31) comprising a

braking lobe (32, 33) for intervention with the rail (21) and that the guide block
(2) comprises a support (38) for the unilateral strain of the safety lever (31) at a

fixed position of the lowermost lamella at a shifting force, due either to upward
shifting or due to the weight of the lamella stack when lowering is impeded by an

obstacle, and a support (38) for release of the safety lever (31) by raising the guide
block (2).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that it comprises a support (38) on
the guide block (2) for horizontal positioning of the safety lever (31), a release

guidance (40) with a tape fastening (39) for fastening the traction tape (1) fitted to
it and with an upper limiting surface (40a) for limiting the safety lever (31) for

causing the held position and a shoe (30) for raising the guide block (2) which
shoe is in one piece with the release guidance (30).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that in the slot (7) of tongue
(4) a bearing (10) for the locking lever (8) is provided for the horizontal position 

of this lever in order to impede a cocking of the braking lobes (32, 33) in the rail
(21) when raising or lowering the hangings by means of the traction tape.
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the braking lobes (32, 33) are
equipped with posterior gripping flaps (34, 35) and thus embrace the web of the

rail (21).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
 in that the locking lever
(8) is supported on the guide block (2) and that the traction tape (I), for raising the

hangings is fastened to a shoe (30) below and adjacent to the guide block (2).
Device according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the lower edge of the locking
lever (8) lies on the guide block (2) when the hangings are raised or lowered, in

order not to exert any braking forces on the web of the rail (21).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the lamella carriers (15)
allocated to the lowermost lamella are supported pivotally by means of a pivot pin

(14), each in a longish tongue (4), which tongue (4) is provided with a slot in
which a pin (6) of the locking lever is engaged and that the braking lobes (32, 33)

lie on two opposite surfaces of the rail (1) at a distance from the pin (6).
Device according to claim 7, 
characterized
 in that the braking lobes are
equipped with posterior gripping flaps (34, 35) on their free ends and thus

embrace the web of the rail (21).
Device according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized
 in that the locking lever (8) is
supported on the guide block (2) and that the traction tape (1) is, for raising the

hangings, fastened to a shoe (30) below and adjacent to the guide block (2). 
Device according to claim 9, 
characterized
 in that the locking lever (8) lies on
the guide block (2) with its lower edge when lowering or raising the hangings in

order not to be able to exert braking power on the web of the rail (21).
