<ABSTRACT>
A light source device for an image processor has a 
light source comprising a p
lurality of LEDs which are 
disposed below a television camera. A shelter plate is 

disposed above the light source so as to prevent light 
emitted from the light source from directly entering the 

television camera. A cylindrical light transmitting 
barrel is provided, extending from the television camera 

to a position sufficiently close to an object to be 
detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light source
devices for an image processor according to the preambles of claims 1 and 9 which convert a picture
image detected by an industrial television (ITV) into a
binary numeral for further processing, and more
particularly to such light source devices of an image
processor adapted to detect a solder leveler formed on a
print circuit board.The image processor which converts a picture image
signal picked up by the ITV into a two-value data
comprising a high level signal and a low level signal (1
and 0) is now used in various technical fields. In an
automatic mounting system of electronic devices, the
image processor is used for detecting the mounting
positions of the devices and positions of standard marks
on a print circuit board.A light source device according to the preambles of claims 1
and 10 is known from US 4 677 473. This document describes a
soldering inspection system wherein light is irradiated on a
soldered part sequentially at differenct incident angles by
said light source device to thereby collect information
indicative of a three dimensional configuration of the soldered
part and to discriminate whether or not the configuration is
acceptable. In order to position several light sources at the
different incident angles, a dome shaped holding means for
holding the ends of a plurality of optical fibers selectively
energizable is provided. Referring to Fig. 1, showing an example of a
conventional image processor, an ITV camera 2 is mounted
on a robot 1 at an appropriate vertical position
dependent on a focal length of the camera. A light
source device 11 is mounted on the ITV camera 2 around a
lens barrel 4 thereof. The light source device 11 has a
light source such as a cold-cathode tube and/or LEDs which
emits light, and a diffusing plate for transmitting and
diffusing the light. In order that diffused light 
transmitted through the diffusing plate may have a
sufficient quantity of light, a light source capable of
emitting a relatively large quantity of light is
selected.The diffused light from the light source device 11
is projected onto a standard mark 10 formed on a print
circuit board 3. However, only the light within a range
indicated by dot-dash lines 11a between the light source
device 11 and the standard mark 10 in Fig. 1 is applied
to the standard mark 10. The direction of light beam to
be projected on the mark 10 is the direction included in
the range between the lines 11a.Since the standard mark 10 is made of a conductive
material such as a
