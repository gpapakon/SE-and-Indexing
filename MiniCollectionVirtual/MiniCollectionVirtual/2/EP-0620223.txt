<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
organic chemistry. The invention provides novel 
tetrahydro-beta-carboline compounds with a high affinity 
for the 5-HT1c receptor. A substantial body of evidence supports the 
relationship between 5-HT1c receptor modulation and a 
variety of diseases and conditions. The 5-HT1c receptor subtype was first detected 
in choroid plexus epithelial cells and is the only SHT 
receptor subtype expressed by these cells. Studies of the 
5-HT1c receptor using radioligand binding have been complex 
due to the cross reactivity of the 5-HT1c receptor with the 
5-HT₂ receptor. The discovery of selective, high affinity 
compounds which discriminate between 5-HT1c and 5-HT₂ has 
been an elusive and important target. Hartig et al., The 
5-HT1cReceptorAnnals New York Academy of Science 149, 
159. Compounds with selective affinity for the 5-HT1c 
receptor can provide treatment for 5-HT1c-receptor-mediated 
conditions without the side effects associated with 
activity at the 5-HT₂ receptor. Such compounds can 
simplify characterization of the 5-HT1c receptor and 
provide useful new therapeutic agents. In vitro, m-chlorophenylpiperazine  
 
(m-CPP) has a slightly higher 
affinity for the 5-HT1c sites than for other 5-HT 
receptors; however, prior to the present invention, there 
have been no known 5-HT1c selective ligands. The activation of the 5-HT1c receptor has been 
associated with numerous behavioural and physiological 
effects. TiPS 11, 181 (May 1990). The 5HT1c receptors in 
the limbic system can affect mood, behavior, and 
hallucinogenesis. Hartig et al., The 5-HT1cReceptorAnnals New York Academv of Science 149, 159. Modulation of 
the 5HT1c receptors has been associated with schizophrenia 
and schizophreniform disorders. Ugedo, L. et. al.Psychopharmacology, 98, 45 (1989); Canton H. et. al. 
Eur. J. Pharmacol. 191, 93 (1990). Hypothalamic 5-HT1c 
receptors can influence sleep, appetite, thermoregulation, 
sexual behavior, motor activity, and neuroendocrine 
function. Hartig et al., The 5-HT1cReceptorAnnals New York Academv of Science 149, 159. Additionally, studies 
indicate that 5-HT1c receptors mediate hypoactivity, caused 
decreased feeding in rats, and have anxiogenic effects. 
Id. Studies have shown that drug-induced penile erections 
are 5-HT1c mediated. Psychopharmacology 101, 57 (1990). 
Likewise, 5-HT1c modulation can treat or prevent priapism. Other studies have used m-CPP to characterize 
responses associated with 5-HT1c receptors. Although
