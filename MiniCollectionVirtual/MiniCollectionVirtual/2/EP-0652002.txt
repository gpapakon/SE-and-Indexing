<DESCRIPTION>
Cartilage is a proteinaceous material found in
the joints of mammals. It is an elastic, spongy substance
which covers the articular surfaces of the bones within the
synovial cavity. The presence of cartilage, with its
special properties of compressibility elasticity and
deformability, permits joints to carry out there two major
functions which are to bare weight and to facilitate
locomotion.Degradation of joints occurs in various diseases
including rheumitoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis,
osteoarthosis, hypertropic arthritis, and osteoarthritis.
Further, acute inflammation of joints may be accompanied by
destruction of the cartilage. Examples of diseases
involving acute joint inflammation are yersinia arthritis,
pyrophosphate arthritis, gout arthritis, and septic
arthritis. Also, another factor that may be conducive to
destruction or degeneration of cartilage is treatment with
cortisoneUS-A-5 075 321 discloses the use of benzothiophene derivatives for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.Dialog Information Services, File 187, FDC Reports, 1987-1993, Accession No.
00089403, & THE PINK SHEET, vol. 55, no. 16, 19 April 1993, discloses
the use of raloxifene for the treatment of osteoporosis.This invention provides the use of
a compound of formula I
 
   wherein R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen,
-CH3,

wherein Ar is
optionally substituted phenyl;R2 is selected from the group consisting of
pyrrolidino and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts and solvates thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting
cartilage degradation, with the proviso that the disease does not include rheumatoid arthritis
or osteoporosis, per se.The current invention concerns the discovery
that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for
inhibiting cartilage degradation. The medicaments
provided by this invention are to be administered
to a human in need of inhibition of cartilage degradation in a
dose of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to
inhibit cartilage degradation. The term inhibit is defined
to include its generally accepted meaning which includes
prophylactically treating a human subject to incurring
cartilage degradation, and holding in check and/or treating
existing cartilage degradation. As such, the present use includes both medical
therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment, as appropriate.Generally, the compound is formulated with
common excipients, diluents or
