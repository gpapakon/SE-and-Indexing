<ABSTRACT>
A method of applying a coating fluid 5 with a coating 
head 1 having a front edge 3 and a back edge 4 receding in a 

direction opposite to the support from the front edge in a 
liquid seal state with a precoat fluid 7 of low viscosity 

consisting essentially of an organic solvent previously 
applied to the application face of the support 2. The 

coating fluid 5 is spouted from a slot at the rear of the 
front edge while the coat thickness of the precoat fluid is 

adjusted by setting the run speed of the support to 400 m/min 
or higher, the curvature R (mm) of the top surface of the 

front edge as a curved surface to 1 ≦ R ≦ 5, tension of the 
support, T (kg/m), to 10 ≦ T ≦ 30, and the incidence angle of 

the support on the front edge, α, to the range of -0.5° to 
2°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an application method of a 
coating fluid and more particularly to an application method 
using an extrusion type coating head for applying a uniform 
coating of fluid extruded from a slot end to the surface of a 
flexible support consecutively running in support of run 
guide means such as guide rollers with the coating head nose 
directed toward the flexible support surface. Hitherto, a step of applying a desired coating fluid 
to the surface of a flexible support has been executed in a 
manufacturing process of photo-sensitive material, magnetic 
recording media, etc. Coating fluids containing various 
fluid compositions are available according to their 
applications, for example, coating fluids of photo-sensitive 
emulsion coats, undercoats, protective coats, back coats, 
etc., in photo-sensitive material and those of magnetic 
coats, undercoats, protective coats, lubricant coats, etc., 
in magnetic recording media. The coating fluids are aqueous 
and organic solvent solutions, etc., containing their 
indispensable components, binders, and various admixtures as 
required. Hitherto, various application methods, such as a roll 
coat method, a gravure coat method, a roll coat plus doctor 
method, extrusion type application method, and slide coat 
method, have been used as methods of applying such coating 
fluids to the flexible support surface. In recent years, the  
 
application method using an extrusion type coating head has 
been often used for applying a magnetic coating fluid. A typical method using an extrusion type coating 
head is, as well known, a method of applying a thin and 
uniform coating of fluid extruded from the slot end to the 
surface of a flexible support consecutively running with the 
coating head disposed between a pair of run guide means 
spaced at a given distance apart at a predetermined place on 
which the flexible support is placed. The method using the extrusion type coating head 
includes, for example, a so-called pressurizing type 
application method of directing the nose of a coating head, 
namely, the top of the front edge and back edge (doctor edge) 
defining a slot from which a coating fluid is extruded toward 
the surface of a flexible support mounted on a pair of run 
guide means, guide rollers and consecutively running in 
support of the guide rollers so as to press it against the 
flexible support surface and changing the space between the 
nose and the flexible support surface in response to a change 
in the extrusion amount of the
