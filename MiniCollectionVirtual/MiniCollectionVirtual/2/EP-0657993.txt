<ABSTRACT>
Low-power-dissipation CMOS oscillator circuits include inductors 
(16,18) and capacitors (26,28,30) forming tank circuitry. Cross-connected MOS 

devices (10-12) provide positive feedback to replenish losses in the tank circuitry 
and thereby sustain oscillations. Each such oscillator circuit simultaneously 

generates complementary output sine-wave signals (at 22,24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oscillator circuits and, more particularly, to low-power-dissipation 
oscillator circuits fabricated in integrated-circuit (IC) form utilizing 
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Oscillators are used in a wide variety of electronic equipment to provide timing 
or clock signals. As the trend to miniaturize such equipment in IC form has increased, 
so too has the desire to provide oscillator circuits in a compatible form. In particular, 
equipment designers recognized that it would be advantageous to have available 
oscillators capable of being fabricated in CMOS, which is generally the currently 
preferred technology for making IC circuit chips. Additionally, the growing importance of wireless communication systems has 
put considerable emphasis on the need to design all the component parts of the IC 
equipment in such systems to exhibit especially low power-dissipation characteristics. 
In fact, the longevity of the power supplies (batteries) included in these systems is often 
an important determinant of their usefulness. And, even in wired systems, low-power-dissipation 
oscillators are advantageous, particularly in very-large-scale IC chips where 
heat dissipation is often a critical consideration in their design. Furthermore, in many systems of practical importance, it is desirable that each 
oscillator circuit therein be capable of generating a clock or timing signal and, in 
synchronism therewith, a complementary version of the signal. In that way, the 
oscillator simultaneously provides two output signals that are exactly 180 degrees out of 
phase with respect to each other. The availability of such out-of-phase reference signals 
enables, for example, simultaneous gating or timing of both p-channel and n-channel 
devices in a CMOS-based system. Thus, it was recognized that a need existed for low-power-dissipation oscillator 
circuits made in CMOS and capable of simultaneously providing complementary output 
signals. It was apparent that such circuits, if available, would be of significant practical 
importance in the expanding field of wireless communication systems as well as in the 
field of wired systems.  In accordance with one embodiment of the principles of the present invention, 
an oscillator comprises cross-connected metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices of 
one conductivity type and an associated tank circuit that includes capacitors and two 
inductors. In a second embodiment of the invention, an oscillator comprises cross-connected
