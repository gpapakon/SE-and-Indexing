<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control device for the controlled blow-out of a needle strip (9), especially of a top comb (6) of a combing machine, by means of a blowing-out device (8, 10, 11, 12, 13), via which compressed air is blown at time intervals between the free passages of the needle strip (9). The known devices for controlling the blowing-out device are based on the mechanical or electromechanical principle. These control devices on the one hand can be influenced by existing machine tolerances, with the result that an exact blowing instant or blowing interval cannot be defined, and on the other hand are restricted in their adjustability to different boundary conditions. It is therefore proposed to form the control device from a microprocessor (15) for controlling the blowing-out device.

<CLAIMS>
A control device for the controlled blowing out of
a needle strip, in particular a top comb (6) of a

combing machine, by means of a blow-out apparatus
(8, 10, 11, 12, 13), through which compressed air

is blown in intervals between the free passages of
the needle strip (9) and the blow-out apparatus

(8, 10, 11, 12, 13) is initiated by the movement
of the nippers (1) during a nip of the comb or any

other machine element (19) of the combing machine
which is driven in a coordinated manner with the

nipper movement, characterized in that the movement
of the nippers (1) or any other machine element

(19) which is driven in a coordinated manner
with the nipper movement is detected by sensors

(23) and the signals issued by the sensors (23)
are transmitted to a microprocessor (15) for the

purpose of driving the blow-out apparatus (8, 10,
11, 12, 13) which allows a precise setting of the

blowing interval on the basis of a predetermined
program and on the basis of predetermined means.
A control device as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the angle of rotation of the circular

comb shaft (21) is scanned.
A control device as claimed in one of the claims 1
to 2, characterized in that for driving the blow-out

device (8, 10, 11, 12, 13) the control pulse
from the microprocessor (15) occurs with a predetermined

lead time (t) with respect to the
blowing time (T
B
) and depending on the count of
the combing cycle.
A control device as claimed in claim 3, characterized
in that the lead time (t) is adjustable. 
A control device as claimed in one of the claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the air pressure of

the blow-out device (8, 10, 11, 12, 13) is adjustable.
A control device as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that the adjustment of the air pressure

is made on the basis of a predetermined interval
with respect to the running time of the machine.
A control device as claimed in claim 6, characterized
in that a first air pressure (P1) is switched

on during the rapid movement of the combing
machine and a second, altered air pressure (P2) is

switched on after a predetermined interval during
the slow movement of the combing machine.
A control device as claimed in one of the claims 1
to 7, characterized in that the duration of the

blowing interval can be adjusted depending on the
count of the combing cycle, or that (T
B
) is preselectable.
A control device as claimed in one of the claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the course of the

pressure build-up in the blow-out apparatus (8,
10, 11, 12, 13) is measured through a sensor (37)

and is transmitted to the control device.
