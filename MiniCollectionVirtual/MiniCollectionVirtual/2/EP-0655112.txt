<ABSTRACT>
A displacement vibration damper, consisting of a primary mass secured to a piston-engine crankshaft to be damped and a secondary mass connected to the primary mass, is fitted with means which ensure the best possible sprung coupling and effective hydrodynamic damping combined with compact construction. The sprung coupling is made using preferably laminated bow springs (15) having a radial shoulder (3) on each side forming part of the primary mass and flexibly interconnecting the primary and secondary masses. The shoulder (3) merges on the outside radially into a peripheral belt (5) which has displacement vanes (7) on its outer periphery, or said vanes (7) are fitted directly to the outer periphery of the shoulder (3). With relative rotation between the primary and secondary masses, the displacement vanes act to provide hydrodynamic vibration damping within function chambers (37) which are formed radially inside an outer ring (13) enclosing the vibration damper at the outer periphery, between the outer periphery of the belt (5) or axial extensions of angle rings (9) and between the sides (slots 33) of sections (35) extending axially from lateral discs (11).
