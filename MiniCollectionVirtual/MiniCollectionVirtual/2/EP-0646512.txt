<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a supporting device for an eddy current brake to which there is fastened at least one linear eddy-current brake pad (6,7) defining an air gap with a rail (8,9) with which the said linear pad is associated; the said supporting device for a brake comprising:     - a first half-beam (1), and   - a second half-beam (2),  interacting with each other via articulation means (3); - means (10) for vertical displacement of the said brake supporting device, and - means (11) for vertical guiding of the said brake supporting device,  interacting with one another; and - at least one support arm (12) integral with one of the ends of the said half-beams (1,2), the end of each of the said support arms interacting with reference means (17) integral with one of the axle boxes (18) so as to impose a predetermined value on the said air gap when the said brake supporting device is in the braking phase.
