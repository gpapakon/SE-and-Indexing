<ABSTRACT>
Guanidine substituted arginines or homoarginines based on monoalkyl carbon substituted ornithines or lysines, having formula (I) wherein R is (CH2)yCH3 or H, R' is CH2 or C(H)(CH2)yCH3, and R" is CH2 or C(H)(CH2)yCH3, with y ranging from 0 to 5, and x is 0 or 1 and Q is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or NH2 or NO2, and only one of R, R' and R" providing an alkyl substituent on the ornithine or lysine moiety. A composition includes said compound together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Methods of use are directed to delivering said compound to inducible nitric oxide synthase to inhibit the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the conversion of arginine to nitric oxide, to administering said compound to inhibit pathological overproduction of nitric oxide from arginine and to administering said compound to a subject having systemic hypotension due to the pathological overproduction of nitric oxide and an  alpha 1, adrenergic agonist to increase blood pressure in the subject to a clinically acceptable level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to novel inhibitors
of biological nitric oxide formation.For several decades nitroglycerin has been
administered to humans as a vasodilating agent in
the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It has
been shown that nitroglycerin so administered is
converted in the body to nitric oxide which is the
pharmacologically active metabolite. Recently,
nitric oxide has been shown to be formed
enzymatically as a normal metabolite from arginine
in vascular endothelium to provide an important
component of endothelium-derived relaxing factors
(EDRFs) which are currently being intensively
studied as participating in regulation of blood
flow and vascular resistance. Macrophages have
also been shown to produce nitric oxide in the
body as a component of their cell killing and/or
cytostatic function.More recently it has been established that
the enzyme forming nitric oxide from arginine,
i.e., nitric oxide synthase, occurs in at least
two distinct forms, namely a constitutive form and
an inducible form. The constitutive form is
present in normal endothelial cells, neurons and
some other tissues. Formation of nitric oxide by
the constitutive form in endothelial cells is
thought to play a role in normal blood pressure
regulation. The inducible form of nitric oxide 
synthase has been found to be present in activated
macrophages and is induced in endothelial cells
and vascular smooth muscle cells, for example, by
various cytokines and/or microbial products. It
is thought that in sepsis or cytokine-induced
shock, overproduction of nitric oxide by the
inducible form of nitric oxide synthase plays an
important role in the observed life-threatening
hypotension. Furthermore, it is thought that
over- production of nitric oxide by the inducible
form of nitric oxide synthase is a basis for
insensitivity to clinically used pressor agents
such as α1 adrenergic agonists in the treatment of
septic or cytokine-induced shock patients.Considerable research effort has been
expended to discover inhibitors for nitric oxide
synthase activity. Much of this research effort
has been directed at uncovering arginine
antagonists to function to inhibit nitric oxide
synthase activity. Most of the inhibitors
uncovered thus far block not only inducible nitric
oxide synthase activity but also constitutive
nitric oxide synthase activity; and typically any
specificity of inhibition of any particular
arginine antagonist for inducible nitric oxide
synthase activity is not so high that it is
possible to block hypotension-causing,
patho
