<ABSTRACT>
Each of a certain number of sequences of binary pixels chosen according to some 
prescribed rules from m x n matrix of pixcels is referred to vector v
i
. A standard 
character k is represented with m x n matrix of binary pixels, from which the vectors 

g
ki
 are derived. The reference vectors G
ki
 are comprised of the vectors g
ki
 and g
ki
' 
which are generated by modification of g
ki
. A recognition object is captured to yield m 
x n matrix of binary pixels, from which the vectors v
i
 are derived for comparison with 
the reference vectors G
ki
. Matching of v
i
 with one of the reference vectors G
ki
 adds a 
count to the standard pattern k corresoponding to G
ki
. The standard character k with 
the maximum score of the matching count is recognized as the recognition object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pattern matching method for accurate recognition of
patterns deviated to a certain extent with relatively small volume of reference patterns.In general, for the recognition method of characters and figures, there are employed
two(2) methods. The former is a method of feature extraction from patterns of
recognition object. The latter is a method of pattern matching with the reference
patterns and has widely been utilized in the fields seeking high-speed recognition in
general.The pattern matching method is a most common method in which a
recognition-objected character is captured to provide a pattern for recognition, which
undergoes the preprocesses such as shading correction, decision of character specific
area, and binarization. The character pattern, normalized in size if necessary, is
compared with the reference patterns (templates) similarly normalized so that the
recognition-objected character is recognized as the character of the template matched.
In pattern matching invariance of recognition-objected character (hereinafter a character
implies both character and figure) has been assumed. This has often resulted in severe
decrease of recognition accuracy due to morphological variance of character,
especially, of boldness in stroke. As a matter of fact, the degree of mismatching
because of variation on boldness is significantly comparable to that in reference to
wrong characters. In FIG. 10A the degree of mismatching is seen between the
numerals 2 and 3, while that between the numeral 3 in the standard sample and in fat
stroke is shown in FIG. 10B. The degree of mismatching with wrong characters
becomes often comparable to that between the standard sample and fat or thin stroked
character, reducing the feasibility of pattern matching. In addition to variance of
character in fat or thin stroke, partial fading, rotation and variation in capture
conditions also cause mismatching.A common method designed to overcome these disadvantages is preparation of 
references learned so as to lead to unique recognition result among every possible
combination of pixels in a m x n matrix plane. This practice of pattern matching at
each pixel is hardly realized because, for the size of matrix practically representable of
a character, for example, 10 x 10, all combination of pixels would amount to an
impossible number of 2100. Pattern matching with higher efficiency and less volume
of data is thus in keen demand.Document GB-A-2 100 904 describes a character recognition system
