<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus and method, which uses an ink composition which is at 
ambient temperatures and which becomes liquid when heated. The apparatus (1) has 

an ink roller (2) and a print drum (3). The ink roller (2) is for inking the printing 
elements (4) provided on the print drum (3). A heating block (5) surrounds and 

radiantly heats the ink roller (2). To maintain the print drum at elevated temperatures, 
heating elements (8) are provided in the print drum (3). Circuitry is provided to 

control the temperature of the heating elements (8) and/or heating blocks (5). The 
apparatus may be clutch or stepper motor driven, and supplied within a packaging 

machine to print batch or date or codes or the like onto packaging material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing apparatus and method, and in 
particular, to a printing apparatus and method which uses an ink composition of the 
type which is solid at ambient temperatures and which is liquid when heated to 
elevated temperatures. The present invention is also particularly related to a control 
means for controlling the operation of the heating means associated with heating the 
ink roller and other portions of the printing apparatus. Various types of apparatus are known for printing date codes, bar codes, batch 
codes, and the like, on packaging materials at the time of packaging products. The most useful of these printing apparatus are those which utilise an ink 
composition of the type which is solid at ambient temperatures and which is liquid 
when heated to elevated temperatures. The advantage of using such an ink 
composition is that after application of the code or other printed indicia on the 
packaging, it then cools and dries quickly. Consequently, it is possible to handle the 
packaging almost immediately after printing without the danger of smearing the 
printed image. The use of such said ink compositions also facilitates easier handling and 
replacement of the ink rollers associated with such printing machines The present invention seeks to provide a printing apparatus which utilises a 
unique configuration of heating elements associated with the ink roller and print drum,  
 
to heat a 'solid' ink composition and the printing elements, to the required elevated 
temperatures necessary to perform the printing operation. The present invention also seeks to provide a control device for controlling the 
operation of the heating elements of the printing apparatus. In one broad form, the present invention provides a printing apparatus, 
comprising:
 
   a print drum having at least one printing element thereon;
 
   an ink roller, for inking the printing element(s), with an ink composition of the 
type which is solid at ambient temperatures and which is liquid at elevated 
temperatures;
 
   a heating block at least partially surrounding said ink roller, to radiantly heat 
said ink roller, and,
 
   heating means within said print drum to heat said printing element. Preferably, the device further comprises control means to control the heating 
operation of said heating block and/or heating means. Most preferably, each said printing element(s) is/are comprised of a moulded 
silicone polymer. A preferred embodiment of the invention is wherein said inking roller is
