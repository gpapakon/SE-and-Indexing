<ABSTRACT>
A rotary kiln (10) is employed which is inclined downwardly from its charge end (12) to its discharge end (14) and has a maximum lenght to breadth ratio of 5:1. The interior space of the kiln (10) is heated by means of at least one burner (B1, B2) directed into the kiln from one end thereof to a substantially constant elevated process temperature. Material is fed into the kiln (10) so that it occupies a maximum of 10 % of the cross-sectional area the interior space of the kiln at the charge end. Upon entering the kiln the material is subjected almost immediately to the required process temperature. As it moves along the bottom of the kiln from the charge to the discharge end, heat transfer to the material is primarily by radiation from the combustion space and from the lining of the kiln.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is considerable demand for lightweight aggregate 
for use by the construction industry in lightweight 
aggregate concretes. Such concretes are used in the 
form of building blocks, precast components such as 
panels, beams and roofing slabs, and in many other 
applications where lightness coupled with sufficient 
strength and low thermal conductivity are important. 
There are also applications where the aggregates can be 
used for insulation alone for example as space infill 
below suspended ground floors, fillings for hollow 
cavities and so on. There are yet other uses, in 
horticulture for instance, where lightweight aggregates 
are used in composts and as a growing media in 
hydroponic cultivation. It is well known that lightweight aggregates can be 
produced by subjecting certain suitable natural 
materials, such as some clays, shales and slates, to 
heat treatment at elevated temperatures to bring about 
their expansion. Where such expansion is possible, the 
material to be expanded usually has to be in particulate 
form as slate or shale chippings, or as pellets made 
from finely ground clay, slate or shale. In this invention much consideration has been given to 
the physical/chemical mechanism whereby materials are 
expanded and its aim is to provide as far as practicable 
conditions whereby maximum expansion can be achieved. 
For expansion to take place the material has to be 
heated to the point of incipient fusion. At these high 
temperatures the material becomes plastic and impervious 
and the gases that are then produced within the material 
are prevented from escaping. This results in the 
formation of a myriad of small gas pockets which cause 
the plastic material to expand and on cooling the porous  
 
structure remains within the solidified material. Some 
gases are evolved within the material at temperatures 
substantially lower than incipient fusion and a 
prolonged period of heating to incipient fusion allows 
these gases to escape uninhibited. It is a teaching of 
this invention that the material to be expanded should 
be heated rapidly to incipient fusion, and that it 
should only be held at this expansion temperature for a 
time sufficient for full expansion to take place as 
unnecessary exposure at an elevated temperature can lead 
to deterioration and a weakened structure. A proportion of expansion gases, mainly steam from the 
water of crystallisation of the mineral constituents are 
evolved at comparatively low temperatures, below 500Â°C. 
Thus preheating the material up

<CLAIMS>
A method of heat treatment of expansible material 
to form lightweight aggregate using a rotary kiln (10) 

which is inclined downwardly from its charge end (12) to 
its discharge end (14), said metnod comprising heating 

the interior space of the kiln (10) by means of at least 
one burner (B1, B2) directed into the kiln from one end 

thereof, 
characterised in that
 the kiln (10) has a 
maximum length to breadth ratio of 5:1 in that the kiln 

(10) is heated by the burners (B1, 82) to a 
substantially constant elevated process temperature along the whole kiln length, and 

in that material is fed into the kiln (via 19) so that 
it occupies a maximum of 10% of the cross-sectional area 

of the interior space of the kiln at the charge end (12) 
so that upon entering the kiln the material is subjected 

almost immediately to said process temperature, heat 
transfer to the material as it moves along the bottom of 

the kiln (10) from the charge (12) to the discharge end 
(14) thereof being primarily by radiation from the 

combustion space and the lining of the kiln (10) and by 
direct contact with the lining of the kiln.  

 
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
interior space of the kiln (10) is heated by means of 

respective burners (81, 82) directed into the charge end 
(12) and into the discharge end (14) of the kiln (10). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
burner or burners (B1, B2) are positioned towards the 

top of the kiln (10). 
A method as claimed in claim 2 or 3 wherein the 
burners (B1, B2) comprise a pair of regenerative 

burners, which operate alternately. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the speed of rotation and the angle of  

 
inclination of the kiln (10) are chosen so that the 

transit time for the material passing therethrough is 
less than 20 minutes. 
A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the 
transit time for material passing through the kiln (10) 

is less than 10 minutes. 
A method as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein the 
transit time for material passing through the kiln (10) 

is 6 minutes or less. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim where 
heat is recovered from flue gases external to the kiln 

(10) and is used to preheat combustion air. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein heat is recovered from expanded material leaving 

the discharge end (14) of the kiln (10) and is used for 
preheating material to be fed into the charge end (12) 

of the kiln (10). 
A method as claimed in claim 9 wherein expanded 
material leaving the discharge end (14) of the kiln (10) 

is fed through a first, downwardly inclined rotary 
cylinder (2) in countercurrent with cooling air, which 

air is then passed through a second, upwardly inclined 
rotary cylinder (4) in countercurrent with feed material 

to effect preheating thereof. 
A method as claimed in claim 10 wherein the first 
and second cylinders (2, 4) are arranged with the feed 

end of the first cylinder (2) substantially in alignment 
with the discharge end of the second cylinder (4) so 

that the stream of air which cools the product and 
subsequently heats the feed material readily flows from 

the first to the second cylinder.  
 
A method as claimed in claim 10 and 11 wherein 
the discharge end of the first cylinder (2) is closed 

off by an accumulation (48) of cooled product in order 
to maintain adequate air flow rate through the

A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein sand is fed (via 20) into the kiln (10) along

A method as claimed in claim 13 wherein hot sand 
is recovered from the material leaving the discharge end 

(14) of the kiln (10) and is reused while hot for
