<ABSTRACT>
Advantage is taken of identifying the differences in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) complements of unwanted tissues and cells as compared to normal tissues and cells to evaluate therapeutic protocols designed to treat conditions characterized by, for example, tumor cells or infectious agents. Therapeutic modulators which affect preferentially the GST complement of normal or unwanted cells or tissues can thereby also be selected for use in combination with drugs which serve as substrates for GST.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method to manipulate
the metabolism of tumor cells differentially from the
metabolism of normal cells. More particularly, it concerns
altering the activity of tumor-specific glutathione
S-transferase (GST) enzymes.Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a group
of isoenzymes which regulate the metabolism and detoxification
of foreign substances introduced into cells. In
general, GST can facilitate detoxification of foreign
substances by a number of mechanisms and can also convert
certain precursors into toxic substances.For example, Waxman, D.J., Cancer Res (1990)
50:6449-6454, has reviewed these functions. As
summarized in this report, GST can detoxify lipophilic
substances which contain an electrophile by catalyzing
the coupling of the electrophilic portion to glutathione
(GSH), thus rendering a significant portion of the
molecule more polar and susceptible to clearance. A
number of the drugs used in chemotherapy are susceptible
to this type of detoxification, including, for example,
various mustards. A second mechanism resides in the
reduction of peroxides with the concomitant oxidation of
glutathione; a third simply involves the association of a
ligand with the GST in a noncovalent association.
Conversely, GST also catalyzes some reactions which 
convert nontoxic precursors to toxic agents. For
example, GST is capable of converting 1,2-dibromoethane
and azathioprine to toxins.Because of the central role of GST in
regulating the toxic effects of foreign substances, it is
evident that manipulating the GST activity in cells which
are subjected to toxic agents intended to kill them will
influence the effectiveness of this treatment. This has
been demonstrated in a number of studies. For example,
Tew, K.D., et al., Cancer Res (1988) 48:3622-3635, showed
that ethacrynic acid and piriprost potentiate the
cytotoxic activity of chlorambucil in rat and human tumor
cell lines. Ethacrynic acid and piriprost are known to
affect GST (ethacrynic acid is a diuretic plant phenol;
piriprost is a prostaglandin analog). Chlorambucil is a
known alkylating agent which is thought to be cleared
from cells by the mediation of GST activity to derivatize
chlorambucil to GSH; it has, in fact, been demonstrated
that chlorambucil is a substrate for GST. The ability of
ethacrynic acid and piriprost to inhibit GST activity was
thus considered responsible for their ability to enhance
the potency of chlorambucil in both chlorambucil-sensitive
and chlorambucil-resistant cell lines, although
considerable

A method of selecting a therapeutic modulator
that affects GST activity preferentially in target cells or

tissue, or selecting a toxin which is relatively unaffected
by the GST complement of unwanted cells or tissues, or

selecting a prodrug that is converted to a toxin by the GST
complement of unwanted cells or tissues, the method

comprising evaluating said modulator, toxin or prodrug with
respect to the GST complement of said target cells or tissue,

said GST complement being determined by a method comprising:

evaluating the value of each information
channel in a panel of characteristics related to GST

isoenzymes of said cells or tissue by contacting said cells
or tissue with each member of a panel comprising n

specifically reactive reagents that are reactive with at
least one GST isoenzyme wherein n is an integer and is at

least 2; and
evaluating the reactivity of each specifically
reactive reagent in the panel with the cells or tissue to

obtain a survey of characteristics (SC) profile for said
cells or tissue; and
comparing the resulting SC profile obtained
from said cells or tissue with a reference set of SC profiles

for the same panel of characteristics obtained from samples
of known GST complements.
A method according to claim 1 wherein, in the
method of determining the GST complement, at least one of 

said reagents is a substrate, inhibitor, activator or inducer
of a GST isoenzyme, or is an antibody or immunoreactive

fragment thereof specific for a GST isoenzyme.
A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein, in
the method of determining the GST complement, said comparing

includes the steps of converting the profile obtained to a
point in n-dimensional space by plotting independently in

said n-dimensional space the value of each information
channel of the panel for the unknown 
cells or tissues,
wherein n is the number of information channels in the panel;


comparing the position of said point to the
positions of reference points in said n-dimensional space

determined in an analogous manner for samples of known GST
complement; and
identifying the GST complement of the unknown
cells from the reference point close st to that obtained from

the unknown cells or tissue.
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a
therapeutic modulator that has been selected by a method

according to any of claims 1 to 3.
A composition according to claim 4 wherein said
therapeutic modulator is an inhibitor or an inducer or

activator for the GST complement of predetermined cells or
tissue.
The use of a toxin effective to destroy or
impair the functioning of unwanted cells or tissue and a

therapeutic modulator selected by a method according to claim
1 effective to render the toxin selectively more susceptible

to detoxification by the GST complement of normal cells or 
tissue as compared to the GST complement of the unwanted

cells or tissue for the manufacture of a medicament for
treating or ameliorating a condition characterized by the

presence of the unwanted cells or tissue.
The use of a prodrug that is converted to a
toxin by the GST complement of unwanted tissues or cells to a

substantially greater extent than by the GST complement of
the normal tissues or cells as selected by a method according

to claim 1 for the manufacture of a medicament for treating
or ameliorating a condition characterized by the presence of

the unwanted cells or tissue.
The use of a toxin which is relatively
unaffected by the GST complement of unwanted tissue or cells

but which is detoxified by the GST complement of normal
tissue or cells as selected by a method according to claim 1

for the manufacture of a medicament for a treating or
ameliorating a condition characterized by the presence of the

unwanted cells or tissue.
The use of a GST substrate effective to consume
the glutathione of unwanted tissues or cells in a reaction

mediated by the GST complement of said unwanted tissues or
cells, but which substrate does not consume the GSH content

of normal tissue or cells, thereby rendering said unwanted
tissue or cells sensitive to electrophiles generated by

chemotherapy or radiation, in combination with a therapeutic
modulator as selected by a method according to claim 1, for

the manufacture of a medicament treating or ameliorating a
condition characterized by the presence of the unwanted cells

or tissue.
