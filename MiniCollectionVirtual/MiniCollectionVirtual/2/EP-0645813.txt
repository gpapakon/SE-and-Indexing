<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor 
integrated circuit chip adapted for mounting to a lead-over-chip lead frame, to 
the semiconductor chip made by that method, and to an encapsulated semiconductor 
module containing that chip. The manufacturing precursor to semiconductor integrated circuit chips for 
use in microelectronics applications is a thin silicon wafer with a diameter of 
approximately two to eight (2-8) inches. Integrated microcircuitry is detailed 
onto at least one surface of this wafer, defined as the active surface, and the 
wafer diced into a plurality of individual semiconductor chips. Semiconductor 
chips are sensitive to alpha particles and other environmental contaminants that 
can cause memory error or corrosion; consequently, the chips usually are 
encapsulated or packaged within a polymeric sealant and delivered as a composite 
semiconductor module. In order to connect an encapsulated chip to external circuitry or a power 
supply, the chip is both adhesively and electrically attached to metal conductor 
leads that extend through the encapsulation. The metal conductor leads are 
produced from a lead frame of copper alloy or other suitable alloy cut to provide 
a plurality of the metal leads. Using a current technique known in the art as 
"lead-over-chip" or "lead-on-chip" (LOC), the lead frame is disposed over the 
active surface of the integrated circuit chip. It is bonded to the chip using 
a double-sided adhesive insulating tape, which typically consists of three 
layers, a first adhesive layer for contact with the chip, a center polymeric film 
that acts as an alpha barrier, and a second adhesive layer for contact with the 
conductor leads. In an alternate configuration, the adhesive may be a single 
layer of film. To make electrical connection, the chips are also wire-bonded to the metal 
conductors with thin wires from bond pads detailed onto the active surface of the 
chip. This wire-bonding implicates the placement of the adhesive tape or film 
that mechanically attaches the chip to the lead frame. The tape cannot cover the  
 
bond pads, but at the same time it must be as close as possible to minimize the 
length of the wire bonds that lead from the bond pads to the conductors. 
Minimizing the length of the wires improves the electrical performance and 
reliability of the encapsulated chip. Encapsulation of the whole composite, 
typically in an epoxy or plastic sealant, takes place after the chip is wire-bonded 
to the lead frame; thus,
