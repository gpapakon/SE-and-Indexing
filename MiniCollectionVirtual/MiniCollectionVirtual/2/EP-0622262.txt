<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power 
transmission (10) that is interposed between the 

internal combustion engine (11) and the drive ratio 
selection transmission (39) of a vehicle. A 

motor/generator (14) is operatively connected to the 
power transmission, and the power transmission 

selectively adds and subtracts torque provided by the 

motor/generator to the torque provided by the internal 
combustion engine. The power transmission effects the 

operative interconnection between both the internal 
combustion engine and the motor/generator to the drive 

ratio selection transmission. The power transmission 
employs compounded first and second planetary gear 

sets (19,21). A common gear member (16) serves not 
only as the ring gear for the first planetary gear set 

but also as the sun gear for the second planetary gear 
set. The power transmission provides operating 

advantages not possible with prior art mechanisms, and 
these advantages allow the internal combustion engine 

to operate with desirable engine emissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power 
transmission for a power train for a vehicle. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a 
vehicular power transmission that is capable of receiving 
input torque from both an electric motor and an internal 
combustion engine. Specifically, the present invention 
relates to an integrated hybrid power transmission that 
is operatively connected to an integral electric 
motor/generator that not only starts the internal 
combustion engine but also augments a friction starting 
clutch with electrically generated torque and/or electric 
motor inertia torque for launching movement of the 
vehicle. The present invention relates to power 
transmissions to co-ordinate the torque output of an 
electric motor/generator and an internal combustion 
engine to a drive ratio selection transmission, and 
especially, to planetary gear sets and the associated 
torque transfer devices utilised for providing the 
desired interaction between the internal combustion 
engine and the electric motor/generator to meet the 
economic and emission requirements of internal 
combustion engines to propel vehicles. DE-A-3842631 
describes a power transmission as in the pre-amble of 
claim 1. FR-A-2200800 describes a power train 
including a power transmission interposed between an 
engine and a drive ratio selection transmission; and a 
motor/generator. Motor/generators have heretofore been 
employed for launching vehicles. However, the prior 
art has not appreciated, and has not therefore, 
disclosed how an integrated motor/generator can be 
incorporated in the overall operation of a vehicle for 
maximum utility.  
 It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide a power transmission wherein the 
power train provides a greater electrical generating 
capacity from a motor/generator than is currently 
available with belt-driven generators. To this end, a power transmission in 
accordance with the present invention is characterised 
over DE-A-3842631 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of Claim 1. The present invention preferably provides an 
integrated hybrid power transmission, as above, that 
utilises the inertia available from the electric 
motor/generator to assist in the vehicle launch. The 
present invention may also provide an integrated 
hybrid power transmission, as above, that reduces the 
rate at which the speed of an internal combustion 
engine is changed during vehicle launch, unlike 
conventional prior art systems, wherein energy was
