<ABSTRACT>
The antenna 
mirror scanner includes a non-rotating fixed-aperture 

antenna (52, 78) for at least one of transmitting and 
receiving an electromagnetic plane wave in a form of an 

antenna scanner beam and a planar reflector (58, 84, 104) 
with at least one reflective planar surface (60, 62, 86, 

106). A rotational axis (64, 88, 108) of the planar 
reflector is aligned orthogonally to a direction of 

propagation (66) of the antenna scanner beam propagating 
at least one of towards and away from the at least one 

reflective surface (60, 62, 86, 106). A motor (70) 
rotates the planar reflector (58, 84, 104) to direct the 

antenna scanner beam incident on the at least one 
reflective surface (60, 62, 86, 106) at least one of
 into 
the non-rotating fixed-aperture antenna (52, 78) when the 

antenna mirror scanner (50, 76, 82, 100) is operating in 
a receive mode and away from the non-rotating fixed-aperture 

antenna (52, 78) when the antenna mirror scanner 
(50, 76, 82, 100) is operating in a transmit mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antenna mirror scanner 
method and apparatus, and more particularly relates to an 
antenna mirror scanner method and apparatus for use in 
remote earth radiometric sensors. A conventional method for generating conically 
scanned narrow antenna beams includes feeding or exciting 
a rotating tilted planar reflector, i.e., a splash plate, 
with a non-rotating direct-aperture source, such as a 
horn or a parabolic feed antenna. The axis of symmetry 
of the non-rotating direct-aperture antenna is aligned 
with a spin axis of the planar reflector. The rotation 
of the tilted planar reflector about its spin axis 
directs the resulting antenna beam in a narrow planar or 
conical scan. When the tilt angle of the tilted planar 
reflector is 45°, that is, when the plane of the planar 
reflector is tilted with respect to the spin axis, a 
planar (i.e., crosstrack) scan is achieved. When the 
tilt angle is at an angle other than 45°, a conical scan 
is produced.  Radiometers detect and measure radiant 
electromagnetic radiation. Conventional high spatial 
resolution radiometers typically employ narrow planar or 
conically scanned antenna beams such as those described 
previously for remote earth sensing of thermal noise 
emissions. A planar reflector included within the 
radiometer may be excited by radiant energy, i.e., 
thermal noise emissions, incident upon a reflective 
planar surface of the rotating planar reflector. The 
radiant energy is detected and measured from a portion of 
the earth tracked by a directed scan of the antenna 
mirror scanner. One example of a conventional antenna mirror scanner 
utilizing a rotating planar reflector is NASA's advanced 
microwave precipitation radiometer 2 shown in Figure 1. 
The advanced microwave precipitation radiometer 2 
functions as a remote earth radiometric sensor, including 
a planar reflector 4 which rotates about a spin axis 10. 
Thermal emission radiation incident upon reflective 
surfaces 9 and 11 of planar reflector 4 is directed 
through either of horn focusing lenses 5 and 7 to non-rotating 
direct-aperture antennas 6 and 8, respectively. 
A pressure lid 12 encloses encoder and scanner control 
electronics 14 and a calibration load section 16. The 
spin axis 10 of the rotating planar reflector 4 is 
aligned with each axis of symmetry of the non-rotating 
direct-aperture antennas 6 and 8.  The symmetrical axes of non-rotating direct-aperture 
antennas 6 and 8 are positioned such that they are 
parallel to the spin axis of the
