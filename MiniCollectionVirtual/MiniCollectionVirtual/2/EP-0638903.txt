<ABSTRACT>
A static random access memory comprises word lines for 
receiving a cell selection signal, and arrays of first memory cells 

connected to the word lines. First load circuits are respectively connected 
to the arrays of the first memory cells for supplying a voltage from a 

voltage source to the arrays. First amplifier circuits are connected 
respectively to the first memory cells. A second, or dummy memory cell 

identical to each of the first memory cells is provided for storing a 
predetermined binary digit. A second load circuit identical to each of the 

first load circuits supplies the voltage from the voltage source to the 
dummy memory cell. A second amplifier circuit identical to each of the 

first amplifier circuits is connected to the dummy memory cell. A 
comparator circuit generates an output representative of the deviation of 

a voltage developed by the second amplifier circuit from a reference 
voltage and negatively feeds it back to each of the first load circuits and 

to the second load circuit so that a voltage developed by each of the first 
memory cells is controlled to a level determined by the reference voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuits
semiconductor memories, and more specifically to a read write memory
in which a load circuit is provided for each array of memory cells as a
load of the transistors of each memory cell.In a prior art static random access memory where each memory
cell is supplied with a voltage through a bit line from a circuit that serves
as a load of the driving transistors of the cell through a gate-controlled
coupling transistor, a voltage developed at the bit line is determined by
the ratio of the ON-resistance value of the loading transistor to the
combined ON-resistance values of the coupling transistor and one of the
driving transistors of the cell. Since the operating characteristics of these
transistors vary with device variabilities due to manufacture and
temperature variations, the memory is designed with a safety margin to
accommodate such factors, and hence, the operating performance of the
memory cannot be exploited to the fullest extent.A memory device as set out in the preamble of claim 1 is known from
EP-A-0 383 078. The known device has means for drawing additional
current from the bit lines to prevent them from becoming floating and
to limit the voltage difference between the paired bit lines.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a static
random access memory capable of automatically compensating for
device variabilities and temperature variations to achieve high speed
operation.The invention is defined in claim 1. The present invention will be described in further detail with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a prior art static random access
memory; andFig. 2 is a circuit diagram of a static random access memory of
the present invention.Before going into the detail of the present invention, reference is
first made to Fig. 1 wherein a prior art static random access memory is
illustrated. The memory includes a plurality of memory cells C11
through Cmn arranged row by row between word lines WL1 ∼ WLn and
column by column between bit lines BLLi and BLRi (where i = 1, 2, ....
m). Load circuits L1 to Lm are connected respectively to pairs of bit lines
BLL1, BLR1 to BLLm, BLLm.Each memory cell Cij (j =1, 2, ... n) includes a pair of inverters
IV1 and IV2 connected in an anti-parallel relationship to each other
between coupling transistors Q5 and Q6. Inverter IV1 is formed with an
N-channel field effect driving transistor Q1 and a P-channel field effect
driving transistor Q3
