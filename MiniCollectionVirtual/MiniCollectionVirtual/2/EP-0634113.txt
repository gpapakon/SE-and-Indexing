<ABSTRACT>
A filter rod is produced by adding a water-soluble 
polymer in the form of an aqueous solution or dispersion, 

or in a particulate form, to a tow of cellulose 
ester fiber, with the amount of any water used being 

controlled within 25 parts by weight relative to 100 
parts by weight of the tow, and wrapping the treated 

tow in wrapping paper. The water contained in the 
filter rod is removed or the particulate water-soluble 

polymer is melted by heating to bond the fiber to 
provide a tobacco filter. The proportion of the water 

soluble polymer is 0.5 to 30 parts by weight to 100 
parts by weight of the tow. To reduce the amount of 

water relative to the tow, a hot-melt adhesive water-soluble 
polymer may be employed. As the amount of 

water added to the tow is thus decreased, the tow can 
be smoothly wrapped up even at a high speed so that 

filter productivity is improved. This tobacco filter 
is highly wet-disintegratable and, hence, contributes 

to mitigation of the environmental pollution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tobacco filter which,
if discarded into the environment after smoking, is
readily disintegrated or dispersed by rain water or the
like.The tobacco filter comprising a tow of cellulose
ester fiber is in broad use for the purpose of removing
the tars from tobacco smoke and yet preserving or
keeping the taste and palatability of the smoke. In
the production of such a tobacco filter, a plasticizer
(e.g. triacetin, triethylene glycol diacetate, triethylene
glycol dipropionate, dibutyl phthalate, dimethoxyethyl
phthalate, triethyl citrate, etc.) is commonly
added for shape retention of the filter plug and for
insuring the firmness or hardness necessary for cutting
out filter tips from the plug.In the filter plug formed with the aid of such a
plasticizer, the filaments have been partly fused
together by the plasticizer. Thus, the plasticizer
plays the role of a binder interbonding the cellulose
ester filaments at random locations. As a consequence,
if the cigaret butt is discarded, it takes a long time
for the filter plug to disintegrate itself, doing 
aesthetic harm to the environment and adding to the
pollution problem.Meanwhile, a paper filter made from creped wood
pulp and a tobacco filter comprising a tow of regenerated
cellulose fiber are also known. Compared with a
filter comprising a tow of cellulose ester fiber, these
filters are slightly more wet-disintegratable and,
hence, of somewhat lower pollution potential. However,
the aroma and palatability of tobacco smoke are sacrificed
and the selective removal of phenolic components
which is required of any tobacco filter can hardly be
expected. Moreover, the firmness of these filters is
lower than that of the cellulose ester filter on a
given pressure loss basis.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
24151/1981 (JP-A-56-24151) discloses a filter comprising
a cellulose acetate fiber and a hot-melt or temperature-sensitive
adhesive fiber bonding said acetate
fiber at points of intersection. As the hot-melt
adhesive fiber, a fibrillated polyolefin or equivalent
fiber is employed and its proportion to cellulose
acetate fiber is 25-50 weight %. This filter is substantially
not disintegrated in water because the
cellulose acetate fiber is three-dimensionally or
nodally bonded at a multiplicity of points of intersection
by the water-insoluble hot-melt adhesive fiber.Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 75223/1975 (JP-A-50-75223) 
corresponding to FR-A-2249125
describes a technology for manufacturing a
tobacco filter which comprises
