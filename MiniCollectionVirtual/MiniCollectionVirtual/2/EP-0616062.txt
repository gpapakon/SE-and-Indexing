<ABSTRACT>
To repair weft-thread breaks occurring in the final stage of the weft-thread insertion operation, after the loom has stopped the latter is rotated in the opposite running direction and is set at a rotary-angle position of the main shaft allowing the automatic repair of the weft-thread break. The repair of the weft-thread break can subsequently be carried out. In this process, a substantial proportion of the types of weft faults which conventionally occur is repaired simply by means of a weft-locating operation. For this purpose, the loom contains a non-return mechanism with a fixed coupling part (16) and an axially displaceable coupling part (17) which are capable of being brought out of operative engagement in order to rotate the loom in the opposite running direction.
