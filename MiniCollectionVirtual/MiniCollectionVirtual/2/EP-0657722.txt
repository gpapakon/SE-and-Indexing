<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air flowmeter
having a hot wire type resistor for detecting air flow
rates to control a vehicle engine.In the conventional equipment, as described by Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open 184923/1982, the output span of
an air flowmeter is set by adjusting resistors connected to
the current detecting terminal of a hot wire and the zero
point is adjusted by changing the standard input voltage of
a differential amplifier.It is difficult in the conventional techniques to adjust
the output of a flowmeter since the zero adjustment of an air
flowmeter output changes also the output span due to
temperature differences in every hot wire product and
convergence operations by alternatively adjusting the zero
point and the output span are needed to fix the zero point and
the output span to each target value. That is, the
conventional techniques have the problem that the zero
adjustment and the output span adjustment can not be 
made independently without mutual interferences. Further,
the conventional techniques cannot give enough compensations
to temperature changes since the output of an air
flowmeter cannot be compensated over the whole range of
flow rates and such output temperature compensation is conventionally
possible at one point only of flow rate.US 5,237,868 discloses a hot wire type air flowmeter
having a drive circuit and an output adjusting circuit comprising
a subtractor having an input terminal applied with
an output of the drive circuit, another input terminal applied
with a constant voltage reference and an output supplied
to a non-inverting amplifier. The zero adjustment and
the output span adjustment are not independent and mutually
interfere.A further hot wire type air flowmeter is disclosed in
JP-A-57184923 disclosing a subtractor to which two variable
signals are applied.The present invention has been achieved in consideration
of the above-described problems, and is aimed at providing
an improved hot wire type air flowmeter.According to this invention there is provided a hot
wire type air flowmeter as claimed in claim 1 herein. The current flowing in the hot wire type resistor is
converted to a voltage signal by a standard resistor. The
output span of the voltage signal is adjusted so as to take
the preset gradient by a non-inverting amplifier. A voltage
follower is connected between a voltage reference source and
a subtracter so as to set the zero point to the preset
voltage.Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the present invention.Fig. 2 shows a sectional view
