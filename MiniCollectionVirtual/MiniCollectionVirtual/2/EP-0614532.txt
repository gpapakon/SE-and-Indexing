<DESCRIPTION>
 CAPACITIVE MOISTURE SENSORFIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to a capacitive moisture sensor.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Conventional moisture sensors such as used on houses or vehicles to close windows or raise convertible roofs typically employ a pair of spaced electrical wires, the resistance between which drops from approximately 19 megohms to 3 megohms when rain bridges the two wires. By moisture is meant all forms of water including precipitation, e.g., dew, snow, sleet, hail, which can result in water bridging the conductors. The decrease from 19 to 3 megohms can be sensed as an indicator of moisture present. But such devices are electrically noisy, have poor sensitivity and are generally unattractive when installed, especially on the smooth contours of a well-designed automobile for example. Another problem with such devices is that they generally require high voltage and the exposure of the conductors and leads renders them vulnerable to corrosion by the weather and consequent short life. The corrosion is especially rapid in the presence of high voltages used in the range of 1 to 20 volts.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved moisture sensor.It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved moisture sensor which senses the effect on the electrical capacitance to detect the presence of moisture.It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved moisture sensor which is simple, reliable, accurate and highly sensitive.It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved moisture sensor which is small, compact, easy to install, and is unobtrusive.It is a further object of this invention to provide such an 

 improved moisture sensor which minimizes exposure of the electrodes and other corrosible parts.It is a further object of this invention to provide such an improved moisture sensor which is safer, longer lived and requires lower voltage.The invention results from the realization that a truly simple and effective moisture sensor can be achieved using a sensing capacitor having a plurality of spaced capacitive sensor conductors on the outside surface of an insulator and a pair of electrodes on the inside, with some means to detect the change in capacitance reflected in a periodic current applied to the electrodes when moisture bridges two of the capacitive sensor conductors; and from the further realization that virtual immunity from degradation of the sensor by contamination or drift can be
