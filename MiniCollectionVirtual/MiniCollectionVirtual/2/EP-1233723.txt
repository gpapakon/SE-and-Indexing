<ABSTRACT>
A stent has a plurality of cells (56) disposed about the circumference of the stent, with at least one cell having a plurality of struts (24, 30, 36, 42) that are connected together to form the cell. At least one strut has a compensating portion (60) of which compensates for foreshortening of the struts during expansion of the stent.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-FORESHORTENING INTRALUMINA PROSTHESISInventors : Geoffrey Hamilton White, Russell J. Redmond, Alan K. PlyleyBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to intraluminal prostheses for implantation into a mammalian vessel, and in particular, to intraluminal stents that do not experience foreshortening in the longitudinal direction when the stent is deployed to an expanded state .2.Description of the Prior Art Intraluminal prosthesis, such as stents, are commonly used in the repair of aneurysms, as liners for vessels, or to provide mechanical support to prevent the collapse of stenosed or occluded vessels. These stents are typically delivered in a compressed state to a specific location inside the lumen of a vessel or other tubular structures, and then deployed at that location of the lumen to an expanded state. These stents have a diameter in their expanded state which is several times larger than the diameter of the stents in the compressed state. These stents are also frequently deployed in the treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels, especially after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, to improve the results of the procedure and to reduce the likelihood of restenosis.U.S. Patent Nos. 5,733,303 (Israel et al . ) and 5,827,321 (Roubin et al . ) describe the problems associated with the foreshortening of intraluminal stents when such stents are expanded. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,733,303 (Israel et al . ) describes stents that have struts whose longitudinal length decreases when the stent expands, thereby causing the overall longitudinal length of the stent to foreshorten. These struts are connected by flexible connecting members, each having an 

area of inflection that functions to compensate for the foreshortening experienced by the struts during expansion of the stent .Unfortunately, there are certain drawbacks associated with providing flexible connecting members that have areas of inflection. First, to accomodate the areas of inflection, these connecting members often create segments within the stent where the aperture or opening defined by these connecting members have a large size. Such increased aperture size may allow increased ingrowth of tissue (also known as "in-stent restenosis") .Second, curved areas of inflection on these connecting members may cause distortion of the lumen of the stent when the stent is twisted or experiences angulation in the longitudinal direction. Third, the connecting members

16. The stent of claim 1, wherein the plurality of cells is a first plurality of cells that is provided along a first length of the stent, and wherein the stent further includes a second plurality of cells that is provided along a second length of the stent.
17. The stent of claim 1, wherein the compensating portion is curved. 

18. The stent of claim 1, wherein each cell has a plurality of apices that are defined by the plurality of struts, and each of the plurality of struts includes a first strut and a second strut to define a double-strut configuration, with each of the first and second struts having a first end and a second end, wherein the first ends of the first and second struts are connected to a first apex, and the second ends of the first and second struts are connected to a second apex.
19. The stent of claim 18, wherein the first and second struts of each of the plurality of struts defines a space therebetween .
20. A stent comprising a plurality of cells disposed about the circumference of the stent, with at least one cell having a plurality of double-struts that are connected together to form the cell.
