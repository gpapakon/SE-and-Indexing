<ABSTRACT>
The structure of the invention serves to support mirrors (106) defining a reflective channel (108, 110) which can dynamically be reciprocally widened and narrowed, as in a two-beam interferometer. It is effectively divided, by pivot points (100) on an intermedial axis, into two opposite portions of equal mass, thus affording to the structure immunization against translational forces transmitted through those points. The opposite portions also have their centers of gravity remotely located, so as to generate a counteracting torque in response to moments of rotational inertia transmitted through the pivot points (100). In the structure, integrally formed planar pieces (92, 94, 96) are assembled to provide contiguous elongated elements and an interposed connecting web element (99), a plurality of which web elements (99) produce a flexure joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a structure for the
dynamic support of reflective elements, immunized against
extraneous forces, and to a two-beam interferometer
incorporating such a structure.Two-beam interferometer spectrometers are well known
in the art. Most of the modern spectrometer designs,
including the Michelson interferometer spectrometer, are
described in Griffiths and DeHaseth, Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer, John Wiley & Sons, NY, Chapter 4,
121-165 (1986).The Michelson interferometer functions by dividing
an incident beam of electromagnetic radiation into two
separate beams at a beamsplitter, each of which beams is
caused to travel along a different optical path; one of
the beams is usually directed along a reference path
having a fixed optical length, while the other is
simultaneously directed along a path of variable length.
A retroreflecting element, such as a plane mirror, a cube
corner, or a "cats eye" reflector, is placed in the
optical path of each beam to return it to the
beamsplitter, where the beams recombine to form a single
exit beam. The optical path length variation, which is
typically achieved by moving one of the retroreflectors,
causes the combined exit beam to be amplitude modulated
due to interference between the recombining beams. By
converting the interferogram so obtained into an
electrical signal, and by then analyzing that signal in a
known manner, the spectrum or intensity of the input
radiation can, after suitable calibration, be derived as
a function of frequency.More particularly, when such an interferometer is
employed in a Fourier transform spectrometer, the exit
beam is focused upon a photoconductive detector to
produce the electrical interferogram signal. If a sample
is so placed that the modulated beam passes through it
prior to impinging on the detector, the analysis 
performed can determine the absorption spectrum of the
sample; other placements of the sample, and other of its
characteristics, can be employed and obtained as well.In those instances in which the optical path length
through the interferometer is varied by displacement of a
retrorefelcting element along the optical axis of the
beam, it will be appreciated that the maximum resolution
attainable with the instrument is directly related to the
maximum path difference that can be produced; i.e., to
the maximum longitudinal displacement that is obtained by
moving the retroreflecting 
element. Because Michelson interferometers rely upon the wave
interference that occurs when the two beams
