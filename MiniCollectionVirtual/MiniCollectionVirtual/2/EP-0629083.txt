<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a scanning converter for
converting the scanning method for a television signal
from an interlaced scanning method into a progressive
scanning method and to a method therefor, and more
particularly, to an interlaced-to-progressive scanning
converter which improves the effects of eliminating noise
and preventing picture quality deterioration by adopting
a double-smoothing function using median-filtering, and to
a method therefor.In general, in an image signal processor such as
those used in televisions, facsimiles or medical
appliances, the image signal based on an interlaced
scanning method is converted into a progressive scanning
signal for improving picture quality, which is otherwise
somewhat deteriorated by the use of interlaced scanning.In the case of a television signal, the interlaced
scanning method is used for an effective utilization of
transmission bands and the physical properties of a
television receiver may result in deterioration phenomena
such as inter-line flickering or line crawling. Moreover,
in the pursuit of large high-quality television screens,
scanning lines are exposed on a screen along with such
deterioration phenomena.In order to alleviate the picture quality
deterioration due to the interlaced scanning method as
described above, the scanning method of a television
signal is converted into a progressive scanning method. In the early days, the interlaced-to-progressive
scanning converter adopted the method of processing a
signal on horizontal and vertical space plane. However,
according to the recent pursuit of high picture quality
for televisions and the reduction of memory cost in
connection therewith, motion-adaptive signal processing is
being generalized for producing televisions having high
picture quality.In the prior art system of Figure 1, an interlaced-to-progressive
converter is shown, the converter performs
a conversion by linear interpolation using a vertical
median, delays the interlaced scanning signal input from
a 1H delay 11 and applies the delayed signal to a first
input terminal of a selector 14. Here, an adder 12 adds
the input interlaced scanning signal to the 1H delayed
signal and applies the resultant signal to a second input
terminal of the selector 14 through a divider-by-two
circuit 13. Then, selector 14 selectively outputs the 1H
delayed signal or the divided-by-two signal alternately
at a double speed of interlaced scanning, to thereby
output a progressive scanning signal.However, the interlaced-to-progressive scanning
