The process according to the invention is characterized in that polymerization takes place in the presence of a sulphur-containing reagent. It has been found that the process according to the invention can be used to prepare polymers that can readily be processed, either in solution or in the melt. It has further been found that the reaction time of the reaction that takes place is short, while also the efficiency of the reaction is good. In the process according to the invention use can be made of monomer units that are thermostable. Such monomer units are easy to synthesize and easy to keep.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A POLYMER FROM A HETEROCYCLIC MONOMERThe invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer from a heterocyclic monomer.Such a process is known from EP-A-399,463. In the process disclosed therein a solution of a heterocyclic monomer is brought at a suitable temperature, after which the polymer is prepared in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The polymer formed is isolated from the reaction mixture using a centrifugation technique, following which the polymer is further purified by means of a precipitation technique.A disadvantage of the process disclosed in EP-A- 399,463 is that the resulting polymer can hardly if at all be processed, both its thermal properties and the solubility properties being absolutely insufficient for this. In addition, the reaction times of the reactions that take place are very long, and the yields of these reactions very low. As a result, large-scale application of the process as described above is not economically viable. A further disadvantage is that the heterocyclic monomer units from which the polymer is prepared is hardly if at all thermostable, so that it can be kept only if the necessary precautions are taken.It is the aim of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of polymers that does not have the above-mentioned disadvantages. The process according to the invention is characterized in that polymerization takes place in the presence of a sulphur-containing reagent.It has been found that the process of the invention can be used to prepare polymers that are readily processed in solution. It has further been found that the reaction time of the reaction that takes place is short, 

while also the efficiency of the reaction is good. In the process according to the invention use is made of heterocyclic monomer units that are thermostable. Such monomer units are easy to synthesize and easy to keep. The heterocyclic monomer units that can be used in the process according to the invention have a structure according to Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 of the formula sheet, where i and R2 are the same or different and are chosen from the group consisting of hydrocarbon, alkyl groups with 1-20 carbon atoms, aryl groups with 6-20 carbon atoms, alkaryl groups with 7-40 carbon atoms, aralkyl groups with 7-40 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups with 1-18 carbon atoms, -0(CH2CH20)nCH3 with n = 1-4 and halogens; or where Rx and R2 both form part of a closed ring structure; X = 0 or S; Y = 0, S or N-R3; R3 is hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl
