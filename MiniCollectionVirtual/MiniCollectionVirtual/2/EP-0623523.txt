<ABSTRACT>
A combination stopper (12) and shield (11) closure for sealing the 
open end of an evacuated 

body fluid collection tube (1) to retain the vacuum therein. The 
stopper (12) and shield (11) are made 

by co-injection molding with the stopper (12) being retained within a 
central aperture (11a) in the 

shield (11) by means of an upper (13) and lower (14) flange or a 
plurality of plugs (7) extending from the 

stopper into the shield. The upper flange (13) has a convex surface for 
directing residue body 

fluid away from the center of the flange to reduce contamination, a 
gas-barrier (57) to increase 

the vacuum seal and prevent contamination, cam followers (16a) in the 
base of the shield (11) to 

interact with cams (5) on the surface of the tube to facilitate closure 
twist-off and flexible tabs (218) 

around the base of the shield (11) to prevent the tube/closure assembly 
from being pushed out of 

a needle holder during body fluid collection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination stopper and shield closure 
for body fluid collection tubes and, more particularly, relates to an improved 
combination stopper and shield closure for an evacuated body fluid collection tube 
having a minimal cross-section at the point of needle penetration together with 
increased retention against needle sleeve push-back when the needle is being pushed 
through the stopper. An evacuated blood collection tube is commonly used by a doctor, 
phlebotomist or nurse to draw a sample of body fluid from a patient in a hospital or 
doctor's office for diagnostic testing. During the use of such a tube a double-ended 
needle in a needle holder is inserted in a vein of the patient, and the closed evacuated 
tube is inserted into the open end of the holder until the needle in the holder pierces  
 
the tube's closure. The blood collection tube contains a vacuum that then draws a 
body fluid sample from the patient into the tube. Therefore, it is important for the 
closure on the tube to fit securely on the open end of the tube and maintain the 
vacuum in the tube before, during and after the blood collection procedure. Current closures for evacuated blood collection tubes include plastic shields 
containing a rubber stopper, wherein the stopper is thick or has an enlarged head to 
fit snugly within and remain attached to the shield and a plug portion that fits in the 
open end of the tube. Retention of the stopper in the shield is important when the 
shield and stopper are being removed from the open end of the tube so that blood 
within the tube can be tested. An example of a closure of the type discussed above 
is found in U.S. Patent No. 4,967,919 (Earhart), which relates to a blood collection 
assembly having an enlarged rubber stopper within a cap that are both mounted on 
an open end of a blood collection tube to seal the tube. It is also important, of course, for the vacuum in the tube to be sufficient 
to draw body fluid into the tube, since body fluid must be drawn as quickly as 
possible to minimize the amount of time a patient has one end of the needle in their 
body, which can be uncomfortable and cause pain. For example, if the vacuum in 
the tube is deficient, subsequent removal of the tube from the needle holder and 
insertion of another tube in the needle holder would be necessary which prolongs 
the unpleasant procedure. Therefore, it is important that the closure fit within the 
open end of the tube to retain the vacuum in the tube before, during and

<CLAIMS>
A closure for sealing an open end of a body fluid collection tube comprising: 

a shield (11) having a well (19) with a central aperture (11a) surrounded by a wall; and 
a sealing element (12) for sealing the tube having an upper flange (13) that is received 
in said central aperture, characterised in that said upper flange 

has a convex surface that directs residue body 
fluid from said convex surface of said upper flange towards said wall of said well. 
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said upper flange further comprises 
a body fluid trap between said wall and said convex surface that collects body fluid being 

directed from said convex surface towards said wall. 
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said shield further comprises an 
outer skirt having a plurality of projections extending from an interior surface of said outer 

skirt into said shield, said projections on said outer skirt positioned to mate with a locking 
ring on an outer wall of the tube to securely lock said closure onto the tube and retain the 

vacuum within the tube. 
A closure according to Claim 3, wherein said shield further comprises a 
plurality of cam followers around said outer skirt that interact with a plurality of cams on 

the outer wall of the tube to facilitate unlocking said projections and twisting off said 
closure from the tube. 
A closure according to Claim 4, wherein said plurality of cams on the outer 
wall of the tube are located in a ring on the outer wall, said ring having a cavity for 

capturing body fluid.  
 
A closure according to Claim 1, further comprising a gas-barrier member 
bonded to said shield to improve vacuum retention within the tube and protect said well 

from contamination. 
A closure according to Claim 1, further comprising a gas-barrier member 
bonded to said sealing element to improve vacuum retention within the tube. 
A closure according to Claim 1, further comprising a shaft extending into 
said well in said closure to facilitate removal of said closure from the tube when a user 

applies pressure on said shaft to release said sealing element from the tube. 
A closure according to Claim 1, wherein said sealing element further 
comprises a lower flange with a lip that form a primary seal with an inside wall and a rim 

at the open end of the tube to minimize the thickness of said sealing element and reduce 
needle penetration force through said sealing element. 
A closure according to Claim 9, wherein said sealing element further 
comprises a vertical extension extending from said lip to form a secondary seal with an 

outer wall of the tube.
