<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a front bearing for a tiltable driver's cab of a lorry, with at least two bearing brackets (3) which are attached to the vehicle frame (2) and on which the driver's cab is supported via elastic bearings (5) which are arranged on mutually aligned bearing spindles (4) and are accommodated in bearing brackets (5) attached to the driver's cab floor (1). According to the invention, in the region of a driver's cab bearing a stop (16) is provided, which stop is arranged fixed with respect to the driver's cab floor (1) and with its stop face (17), with the driver's cab in the driving position, reaches, with little clearance, in such a manner behind the bearing spindle (4) and a central tube (15), surrounding the latter, of the elastic bearing (5) that it does not prevent the compression of the driver's cab but, as the driver's cab is being tilted, can be displaced together with the spindle and tube of the bearing, in the direction of force (18) of a tilting cylinder, under the action of force thereof, after a short distance comes to rest on the bearing spindle (4) and the bearing central tube (15), and remains supported there whilst the driver's cab is tilted further. As a result, it is possible to design the elastic bearing (5) such that it is relatively soft and with a view to the driver's cab having very comfortable suspension.

Front mounts for a tilting cab of a truck, with at least two mount consoles 
(3) attached to the vehicle frame, at which mount consoles the cab is 

supported via elastic bearings (5) that are arranged on bearing shafts (4) 
aligned relative to each other and are supported in bearing shells (6) 

attached to the vehicle floor (1), characterised in that in the area of a cab 
mount a stop (16) is provided which is fixed in relation to the vehicle floor 

(1) and, when the cab is in driving position, grips with its stop face (17), on 
the rear side and at a short distance, the bearing shaft (4) and a central tube 

(15) of the elastic bearing (5) which central tube (15) encloses said bearing 
shaft (4) so that said stop (16) does not impede the cab's spring 

compression, but during cab tilting operations and at the application of 
force from a tilt cylinder can be shifted together with the cab in the 

direction of the force (18) from said tilt cylinder and, after a short distance, 
contacts the bearing shaft (4) and the bearing central tube (15) and remains 

supported there if the cab is tilted further. 
Cab mounts according to Claim 1, characterised in that the stop (16) is 
formed by a supporting metal plate arranged on the outside of the bearing 

shell (6). 
Cab mounts according to Claims 2, characterised in that the supporting 
metal plate is made in one piece together with the bearing shell (6). 
Cab mounts according to Claim 2, characterised in that the supporing metal 
plate is a prefabricated single piece and attached, ie welded or bolted on, to 

the bearing shell (6). 
Cab mounts according to Claim 1, characterised in that the stop (16) is 
formed by a part of a support bow (19) which, together with the bearing 

shell (6), is attached to the cab floor (1), whereby the stop face (17) is 
provided on side walls (16/1, 16/2) which run parallel to each other and are 

curved at the base of the support bow (19). 
Cab mounts according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that, 
when the cab is in driving position, the distance between the stop face (17) 

on the stop (16) and the outer contour of the bearing shaft (4) and of the 
central tube (15) of the elastic bearing (5) is smaller than/equal to the 

structurally determined, permissible deformation of the elastic bearing (5).
