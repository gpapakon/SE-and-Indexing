<ABSTRACT>
A lead (20) is provided which assists in the 
implantation of the lead within an artery or vein of a 

human heart. The lead includes a lead body (32) having a 
distal end (26) and a proximal end (24) and at least one 

electrode (22) carried by the lead body intermediate the 
distal end and the proximal end. The lead includes a 

guide tip (38) carried by the lead body which extends 
distally from the lead body distal end. The guide tip 

includes a distal tip end (42) and a tapered portion (40) 
forming the distal tip end. The tapered portion is curved 

in a direction of curvature to offset the distal tip end 
in a direction from the longitudinal center axis (44) of 

the lead body. The guide tip may further include a 
fixation structure (54) for retaining the lead in place 

after implantation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
implantable intravenous or endocardial lead for use with 
an implantable cardiac device, such as an atrial 
defibrillator. The present invention is more particularly 
directed to such a lead which is implantable within a vein 
or artery of the heart and which includes a steerable tip 
at the distal end of the lead to enable the lead to be 
steered along a desired path as the lead is implanted. 
The steerable tip may also include fixation means for 
retaining the lead within the artery or vein. Implantable cardiac devices, such as pacemakers or 
defibrillators, are well known in the art. Such devices 
are configured to be implanted within a subcutaneous 
pocket beneath the skin of a patient and to be 
electrically coupled to the heart through one or more 
leads also implanted beneath the skin of the patient. 
Each lead includes at least one electrode which, when 
properly positioned within the heart or within a vein or 
artery of the heart, makes electrical contact with a 
desired portion of the heart for either sensing heart 
activity or applying a therapeutic electrical stimulus to 
the heart. One such implantable cardiac device is an atrial 
defibrillator of the type, for example, described and 
shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,207,219 which issued on May 4, 
1993 in the names of John M. Adams, Clifton A. Alferness, 
Kenneth R. Infinger, and Joseph M. Bocek for "Atrial 
Defibrillator and Method for Providing Interval Timing 
Prior to Cardioversion", which patent is incorporated 
herein by reference. The atrial defibrillator described  
 
in that patent utilizes a first electrode positioned in 
the right atrium or superior vena cava of the heart and a 
second electrode positioned in the coronary sinus and 
great cardiac vein of the heart adjacent the left atrium. 
When the atria are in need of cardioversion, the atrial 
defibrillator applies cardioverting electrical energy 
between the first and second electrodes to cardiovert the 
atria. The cardioverting pathway between the right atrium or 
superior vena cava and the coronary sinus and great 
cardiac vein has been shown to exhibit distinct advantages 
over previous pathways for cardioverting the atria. For 
example, by cardioverting the atria between the right 
atrium or superior vena cava and the coronary sinus and 
great cardiac vein, the cardioverting electrical energy is 
confined, in large measure, to the atria. This reduces 
the risk of undesirable side effects such as the 
inducement of ventricular
