<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for purification 
of phenol and specifically to a method for purification 

of phenol produced within the process of joint phenol and 
acetone production by cumene method. 
The aim of the invention is to develop a catalyst 
which has high activity for phenol purification from 

organic mico-impurities with regeneration of the catalyst 
and which has high mechanical strength and stability with 

long catalyst life. 
This result is obtained by phenol purification using 
a heterogeneous zeolite catalyst. The acidity of the 

catalyst measured by butane cracking (K
A
) is more than 10. 
Phenol derived from distillation of heavies and 
lights and still containing impurities i.e., 

hydroxyacetone, mesityl oxide, 
&
-methylstyrene, 2-methylbenzofurane 
and other carbonyl compounds and not 

containing water (water content not more than 1 wt%, 
preferably less than 0.1 wt%) contacts the zeolite 

catalyst at a temperature between about 120 to 250°C 
(preferably 180 to 200°C) and space velocities 0.1-3.5 

hr⁻¹ (preferably 0.8-1.2 hr⁻¹). 
It has been discovered that said purification 
results in conversion of such impurities as mesityl 

oxide, hydroxyacetone, 
&
-methylstyrene and other carbonyl 
compounds of not less than 90%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of purification of
phenol and in particular, to a method of purification of phenol which
is produced within joint phenol and acetone production by the
cumene method.Phenol, after being distilled from heavy and light products of
the joint synthesis, still contains the impurities of organic matters such
as mesityl oxide, alpha-methylstyrene, 2-methylbenzofurane and other
carbonyl compounds which are difficult to remove by conventional
methods such as, for example, distillation. These impurities worsen
the properties of commercial phenol since such phenol has low color
stability.A widely known commercial method of phenol purification
from organic micro-impurities is a method based on phenol contact
with ion-exchange resins as taught in Technology report;
"Development of process scheme for phenol purification at ion-exchange
KY-2, KY-2-8γc for Ufa Plant of Synthetic Alcohol",
Giprokauchuk, Novokuibyshevsk, 1986, p. 84. The disadvantages of
this method are a narrow temperature range of resin application (50-130°C),
limited life of usage due to unrecoverable destruction of
catalyst granules as well as problems of spent resin utilization.USA Patent No. 3,454,653 and USA Patent No. 3,029,294
describe methods of phenol purification from impurities using
aluminosilica catalysts. Disadvantages of these methods are low
catalyst activity and, hence, long contact time (4-8 hours), as well as
selective purification from one of the impurities components (in
3,454,653 from 2-methylbenzofurane, in 3,029,294 from
hydroxyacetone).US-A-2948758 discloses a method of purifying
phenol produced by cleavage of cumene hydroperoxide
and containing minute amounts of cumene, α-methylstyrene
and butyl benzenes as genetic impurities, 
which comprises contacting the phenol in the liquid
state with a nonpolar solid adsorbent selected from
Fuller's earth, precipitated chalk, heat activated
clay, talc, bentonite and activated carbon, separating
the treated phenol from the adsorbent and fractionally
distilling the treated phenol to separate a fraction
of pure phenol.The purpose of the present invention is
the development of a catalyst with high activity
for phenol purification from impurities with 
efficient regeneration, high mechanical strength and stability to give a
long catalyst life.This purpose is achieved by phenol purification using
heterogeneous zeolite catalysts which are distinguished by the certain
level of acidity measured, for example, by a method of butane
cracking as described in
