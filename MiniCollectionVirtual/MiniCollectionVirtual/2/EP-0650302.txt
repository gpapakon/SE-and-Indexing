<ABSTRACT>
A facility is provided for enhancing an operations support system so 
that, based on data generated as a result of an event occurring in an associated 

telecommunications network, the operations support system can predict the 
likelihood of the event occurring again in the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processing data generated by a 
telecommunications network and applying the result of such processing to other 
network data to predict the possibility of a particular event happening in the network. A large telecommunications network typically generates a large number 
of reports over a short period of time, e.g., twenty-four hours. Such reports include 
data relating to, for example, telephone traffic, circuit alarms, etc. A Network 
Management System (NMS) associated with the telecommunications network 
accumulates and processes the data to track and manage the performance of the 
network. Such management includes (a) identifying and repairing network problems 
when they occur, and (b) trends in telephone traffic patterns. For example, consider 
the way in which an NMS processes trouble alarms, which may be classified as 
either transient or non-transient. Non-transient alarms are usually indicative of a 
"hard" fault. Transient alarms, on the other hand, are usually indicative of either a 
reoccurring and nonreoccurring network problem. A nonreoccurring alarm is 
usually the result of an inconsequential fault and, therefore, may be ignored. The 
reason for this is that a nonreoccurring alarm is most likely the result of some 
external condition, such as, for example, a strike of lightning, causing a momentary 
loss of a carrier signal at a point in the network. A reoccurring transient alarm, on 
the other hand, is usually indicative of a chronic problem, for example, a network 
facility or circuit that fails when particular conditions occur. Such a problem might 
affect the quality of telecommunications when it occurs. In most instances, however, it is difficult to distinguish a chronic alarm 
from a transient, non-chronic alarm. Moreover, the majority of alarms that are 
generated in a telecommunications network are of the nonreoccurring type. Because 
of this, an NMS may spend an inordinate amount of time and resources attempting to 
identify the sources of respective nonreoccurring alarms, thereby possibly delaying 
the repair of chronic problems. An advancement in the art of telecommunications is achieved by 
arranging an operations support system so that, in accord with an aspect of the 
invention, it generates a rule set from data generated by an associated 
telecommunications system and then applies the rule set to data subsequently  
 
generated by the telecommunications system to predict that a particular event(s) will 
likely occur in the system. In an illustrative
