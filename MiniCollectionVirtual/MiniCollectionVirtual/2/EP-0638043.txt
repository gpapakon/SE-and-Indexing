<DESCRIPTION>
 EASY OPEN CLOSUREThis invention relates to an easy open closure. In particular, it relates to an easy open closure for a container designed to be closed under vacuum and to a container provided with such a closure. The traditional method of closing a vacuum-type container comprises simply placing the closure over the open end of the container so that the vacuum created in the container causes the closure to adhere to the container. A tight seal is obtained by the use of a gasket or sealing compound provided between the container body and the closure.The present invention seeks to provide a closure which improves the openability of a vacuum container whilst not unduly increasing the cost of manufacturing the closure.According to the present invention, there is provided an easy open closure for a container having a rigid body and being adapted to be closed under vacuum, the closure comprising a panel, a tab connected to the panel, and a score in the panel, the tab being suitable for rupturing the score and releasing the vacuum.Preferably, the tab is located close to the score and may substantially cover the score.Easy-open ends are known for example for metal containers for carbonated drinks, in which a tab is generally riveted to a central panel of the end. A closure portion of the end is defined by a score line which can be broken by lifting a rear portion of the tab so as to detach the closure portion from the rest of the central panel thus providing an aperture through which product may be extracted from the container. Whilst such ends and associated technology are well-known for beverage 

containers, for example, no suitable opening of this kind has been developed as a closure for vacuum containers.The closure may be rigid and may therefore be used as a loose cover after opening the container to protect the product inside, since only a small vent hole will be present in the closure when the score is broken.The primary function of the tab of the present invention is to break at least part of the score so as to release the vacuum. The tab does not break the score so as to provide an aperture in the closure through which a product can be removed from the container as in a beverage container, for example. The release of the vacuum enables the whole closure to be removed by simply lifting the closure, without needing to tear away the whole score or to provide access to the product via an aperture in the closure.According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a container having

CL AIMS :
1. An easy open closure for a container having a rigid body and being adapted to be closed under vacuum, the closure comprising a panel, a tab connected to the panel, and a score in the panel, the tab being suitable for rupturing the score and releasing the vacuum.
2. A closure according to claim 1, in which the score is substantially U-shaped.
3. A closure according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the tab is rivetted to the cover.
4. A closure according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which the tab comprises a gripping ring.
5. A closure according to any one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising a sealing compound arranged at its periphery.
6. A closure according to any one of claims 1 to 5, in which the score is rupturable to release the vacuum without providing a dispensing aperture in the closure.
7. A closure according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which the closure is substantially rigid.
8. A vacuum container comprising a rigid body and a closure according to any one of claims 1 to 7.
