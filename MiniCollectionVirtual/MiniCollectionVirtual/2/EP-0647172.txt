A holding device (10) for accommodating tools (11) of 
different dimensions and comprising cylindrical or polygonal 

shanks in appropriate receiving holes (1) arranged in rows, 
with which receiving holes (1) there is associated an 

elongate precision measuring channel (3) arranged parallel 
with the receiving holes (1) arranged in rows and with each 

of which receiving holes (1), in or on the precision 
measuring channel (3), there is associated a measuring gauge 

(2) formed of stop members (5, 6), a plurality of precision 
measuring channels (3) being arranged in the holding device 

(10) with associated receiving holes (1) and substantially 
parallel with each other, said receiving holes (1) opening 

into a coarse measuring channel (9) extending at the end of 
the precision measuring channel (3) at right angles thereto, 

characterized in that the holding device (10) is formed of a 
housing part, e.g. a dish-shaped upper housing part (20), and 

a further housing part, e.g. a base plate (21) fastenable to 
the first housing part, the tubular receiving holes (1), the 

precision measuring channels (3) and the coarse measuring 
channel (9) as well as recesses (22) for the stop members (5, 

6) constituting the measuring gauge (2) being formed on the 
upper housing part (20). 
A holding device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a plurality of receiving holes (1) are associated 

with each measuring gauge (2). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the tubular receiving holes (1) are of one-piece or multipart 

construction and are provided with adjusting means such 
as threads, for example.  

 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the tubular parts (23) of the receiving 

holes (1) are extended by sleeves (24) which are wholly or 
partially threaded. 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the threaded sleeves (24) are constructed as separate 

components. 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the threaded sleeves (24) are constructed as half-shells, 

which may be connected together longitudinally and/or 
transversely by clips or the like. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the base plate (21) comprises end supports (25) for receiving 

and centring the threaded sleeves (24). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the measuring gauges (2) are formed of round or polygonal 

pegs insertable into the recesses (22). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the recesses (22) have cross sections which are conformed to 

the cross sections of the pegs forming the measuring gauges 
but are larger than the pegs and provide a clearance zone for 

the pegs. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
each measuring gauge (2) is formed of two opposing edges of a 

recess (27) provided in a plate (26, 28). 
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that 
each measuring gauge (2) is formed of individual U-shaped 

members (28) which are each fitted at the point provided into 
the recess (22) in the upper housing part (20).  

 
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the measuring gauges (2) are formed of plates (26) which are 

trimmed to a U-shape at the positions corresponding with the 
precision measuring channels (3), such that a plurality of 

measuring gauges (2) are connected together. 
A device according to claim 12, characterized in that 
the plates (26) comprise coding means (29). 
A device according to claim 13, characterized in that 
the coding means (29) are provided with counter-codings (30). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
adjusting means for height regulation of the bases of the 

receiving holes (1) are provided in the tubular receiving 
holes (1). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
height-adjustable adjusting screws (33) are provided in the 

threaded sleeves (24). 
A device according to claim 15, characterized in that 
the adjusting means (33) are actuatable from above through 

the receiving holes (1) and/or from below through the base 
plate (21). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the upper housing part (20) including the components forming 

the threaded sleeves (24) and the plates (26, 28) is filled 
in or foamed in, the filler being of solid or resilient 

nature. 
A device according to claim 18, characterized in that 
the inside of the upper housing part (20) and the base plate 

(21) comprise undercuts into which the filler may penetrate 
and thus effect firm connection of the upper housing part 

(20) with the base plate (21).  
 
A device according to claim 1, characterized by a lid 
(34).
