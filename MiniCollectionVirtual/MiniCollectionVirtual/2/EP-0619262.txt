<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for applying a liquid, for example oil, on to a running yarn, with a rotatably mounted roller (1), projecting into the yarn run, for receiving a liquid film on its surface (1') out of a liquid reservoir (9) and for dispensing the liquid by surface contact. In order to improve a device of this type in a manner advantageous for its use, a spatial separation of the roller and reservoir is provided. The liquid is to be conveyed to the roller by means of a wick (6) arranged between the roller (1) and reservoir (9).

A device for applying a liquid, for instance oil, to a traveling thread,
comprising a rotatably mounted roll (1) which extends into the line of the

thread to receive a film of liquid on its surface (1') from a liquid reservoir (9)
and to discharge the liquid by surface contact, having a spatial separation of

roll (1) and reservoir (9), and comprising a wick which projects at one end
into the liquid reservoir arranged below the roll and which at the other end

wipes against the surface of the roll, characterized in that the wick (6) wipes
by the action of a leaf spring only against the lower half of the roll (1) and the

thread (2) which extends in horizontal direction through passages (14, 18)
wipes against the upper half of the roll (1).
A device according to claim 1, characterized by a roll (1) which is rotatingly
driven by a motor.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
speed of rotation of the roll (1) can be controlled by an electronic control

device (4).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
roll (1) rotates with the speed of travel of the thread.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
roll (1) is displaceable transverse to the direction of travel of the thread in the

direction (x) to the line of the thread.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
wick is pressed against the roll (1) by a leaf spring (10) which is arranged

parallel to the wick. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
roll is arranged askew to the line of the thread.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
device is arranged in front of a thread storage means (5) and the drive of the

roll is synchronizable, and preferably can be brought into proportional travel,
with the drive of the thread storage means.
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the electronic control circuit
is in signal communication with a thread storage means.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the reservoir (9) is received by a container (19) which is arranged below the

roll and which is closed in operation except for the wick passage (24).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
device behind which on the thread discharge side a thread storage means

(5) is arranged has a thread brake (27) arranged in front of it on the thread
feed side.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized by a
second reservoir (28) of larger volume which is arranged below the reservoir

(9) and from which liquid is conveyed into the first reservoir (9) by, in

particular, a conveying device (40) developed as hose pump.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
conveying device which is developed as hose pump (40) is arranged coaxial

to the roll (1) and, in particular, has a drive motor (7) in common with the roll
(1). 
A device according to claim 13, characterized in that the delivery output of
the conveying device, developed in particular as peristaltic pump (4), is

greater than the delivery output of the wick (6).
A device according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that the transfer
means for the liquid is developed as a tube or hose and the liquid is

conveyed as a result of a pump by the transfer means from the reservoir to
the roll.
