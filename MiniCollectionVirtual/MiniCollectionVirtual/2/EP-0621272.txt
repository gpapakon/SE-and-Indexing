<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 1,2,5-thiadiazole 
derivative and a production process thereof. The 
1,2,5-thiadiazole derivative of the present invention is a 
compound useful as an intermediate for organic compounds and an 
intermediate for medicines and agricultural chemicals. Furthermore, the present invention relates to another 
novel 1,2,5-thiadiazole derivative and also to an agricultural 
and horticultural fungicide containing it as an active 
ingredient. FR-A-2181527 discloses fungicidal substituted 3-phenoxy 1,2,5-thiadiazoles. 3-Alkoxy-4-hydroxy-1,2,5-thiadiazoles are described in 
Journal of Organic Chemistry, page 2823 (1967). However, the 
thiadiazole derivative of the present invention represented by 
formula [I] described below and the production process thereof 
have not been known. Further, the thiadiazole derivative of 
the present invention represented by formula [III] described 
below and the agricultural and horticultural fungicide 
containing the thiadiazole derivative as an active ingredient 
have not been known. Further, many compounds having a fungicidal activity 
are utilized in agriculture but various problems, such that 
the tolerance for plant pathogenic fungi is revealed by using  
 
continuously the same or similar chemicals for a long period of 
time, have been indicated and hence the development of novel 
agricultural and horticultural fungicides which can prevent the 
revelation of the tolerance has been desired. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a novel thiadiazole derivative useful as an intermediate 
for organic compounds and an intermediate for medicines 
and agricultural chemicals and also to provide a production 
process thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a novel agricultural and horticultural fungicide. These and other objects of the present invention have 
been achieved by a 1,2,5-thiadiazole derivative represented by 
the following formula [I]: 
 
wherein X and Y are the same or different and each represents 
a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group including 
straight chain, branched or cyclic groups having from 1 
to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms, a nitro group, a trifluoromethyl group, a carboxyl  
 
group, an alkoxycarbonyl group having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 4 carbon 
atoms, a naphthyl group or a tetrahydronaphthyl group. Further, these and other objects of the present 
invention have been achieved by a process for producing the
