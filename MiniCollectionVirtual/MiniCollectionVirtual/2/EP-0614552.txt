<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to clocks for digital circuits. More particularly,
the invention pertains to clocks having fault tolerance.Digital fault tolerance provisions are needed because of the serious
consequences of system failure. The common way of achieving such fault tolerance is
through redundancy of systems or subsystems such as computers and sensors which
must have synchronized time bases. However, it is essential that the synchronization
of the time bases be fault tolerant. Also the method or device implementing fault
tolerant synchronization should incorporate latent fault detection and reporting so that
maintenance and troubleshooting may facilitate the prevention of system failures.In the case of a parallel set of redundant subsystems, such as computers,
it is important that neither strays too far ahead or behind the other in its processing
tasks. Although synchronization is required among the systems, such synchronization
must be fault tolerant, and must include latent fault detection and reporting. Further
the series connections of redundant components (for instance, redundant sensors in
series with redundant processors) require synchronization in order to communicate
information.A variety of fault tolerant synchronization schemes exist. Some involve
computations which are suitable for synchronizing low frequency clocks whose period
is very long relative to the time required for the computations, so that the skew
induced by variations in the synchronization mechanism itself is acceptable. Such
schemes may be implemented in software; however, such an approach may be
incompatible with the architecture of some digital systems wherein computers may be
present but dedicated to various tasks. In such situations, the addition of an entire
general purpose computer or computers to perform the synchronization task may be
very inefficient in comparison to the utilization of dedicated clock circuitry.U.S. patent no. 4,644,498 discloses interconnections between power up
timeout means of different modules for inhibiting the voted master clock until all
power supplies are on and stabilized, with the aim of a fault tolerant simultaneous
startup. This patent also has a master clock voter means that is interconnected
between the modules.There are approaches which provide fault-tolerant clocks with minimal
dedicated circuitry. Most of these designs are only one-fail operable, with the 
exception of one which provides an algorithm (not a circuit) that achieves N-fail
operability with 3N+1 clock modules.No design
