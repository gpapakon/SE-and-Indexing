<ABSTRACT>
A spool type valve for minimizing degradation in 
sealing ability is provided. The spool type valve comprises 

a spool (30) having land portions (36A-36E). The spool is inserted 
into a sleeve (20) for slidable movement along the axis thereof 

so as to define a plurality of fluid passages (23,24) in the 
sleeve. The spool controllably opens and closes ports (21A-21E) 

of the sleeve. Each land portion includes a slider member 
(38) and an O-ring (37). The slider member is divided into plural 

elements and is in slidable engagement with the inner wall (22) 
of the sleeve. The O-ring is adapted to resiliently urge the 

slider member against the inner wall of the sleeve. The slider 
member includes a annular groove (39B) into which the O-ring (37) 

is fitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement of a spool
type valve
as disclosed, e.g., in US-A-3 115 701 or EP-A-356185.A spool type valve is conventionally known in the
art which comprises a sleeve having a plurality of ports
spaced apart along the axis thereof, and a spool having
integral land portions for controllably opening and closing
the ports of the sleeve. The spool is inserted into the
sleeve for slidable movement along the axis thereof so as
to define plural fluid passages in the sleeve. Such a
spool type valve is used for the purpose of fluid control.One prior art spool type valve employs an O-ring
as a sealing member on the land. The O-ring is in slidable
contact with the inner wall of the sleeve so as to seal the
fluid passages.It is noted, however, that the above spool type
valve is designed so that the O-ring is slidably engaged
directly with the inner wall of the sleeve. Accordingly,
the O-ring tends to undesirably deform due to foreign
material contained in oil or air, such as dust, powder
caused from abrasion, for example, so that sealing ability
is degraded during repetitive use of the spool type valve.
It is also noted that immigration of foreign material into a
space between the O-ring and the spool may cause undesirable
lift-up of the O-ring.Under the circumstances, the present invention is
aimed at to provision of a spool type valve which can
minimize degradation in sealing ability during use. In order to achieve the above object, the invention
provides a spool type valve as defined in claim 1. This spool valve comprises a spool having a land
portion, the spool being inserted into a sleeve for slidable
movement along the axis thereof so as to define a plurality
of fluid passages in the sleeve, whereby controllably
opening and closing a port of the sleeve, the land portion
including a slider member and an O-ring, the slider member
being divided into plural elements and being in slidable
engagement with the inner wall of the sleeve, the O-ring
adapted to resiliently urge the slider member against the
inner wall of the sleeve, the slider member having an
annular groove into which the O-ring is fitted.The slider member is urged against the inner wall
of the sleeve by means of resiliency of the O-ring. The
O-ring is prevented from wearing, since the O-ring is not
in slidable engagement directly with the inner wall of the
sleeve. The O-ring is protectively received within the
annular groove of the slider member, so that swelling of
the O-ring due to fluids such as oil, and deformation of
