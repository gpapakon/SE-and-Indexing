<ABSTRACT>
Display is made according to the user's request by 
using the time information recorded on the disk. A disk 

contains a management area in which management data is 
recorded and a data area in which programs are recorded. 

Recorded in the management area are the absolute time 
information on the starts of the programs and the in-program 

relative time information on the starts of data 
units constituting each program. In the absolute time 

display mode, the absolute time information for display 
is obtained from the absolute time information on the 

program being reproduced and the relative time 
information on the data unit of the program being 

reproduced (steps S1 to S5). In the relative time 
display mode, the absolute time information of the 

program being reproduced is set at 0 (steps S7 and S8), 
and the absolute time information for display is 

obtained from the relative time information on the data 
unit of the program being reproduced. In the frame 

number display mode, the frame information on the output 
image is counted and the current frame number is 

determined (step S10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reproduction apparatus 
capable of recording and reproducing a program, such as 
a movie, on a recording medium, such as an optical disk 
or a CD-ROM, and more particularly to a reproduction 
apparatus with a time display function. Since such recording mediums as magnetic disks or 
optical disks enable high-speed data access, though they 
have a smaller memory capacity than magnetic tape, they 
facilitate the reading, the transferring, and the head-locating 
of a program of moving-picture data. Recent 
advances in high-efficient coding technology for image 
data have made it possible to store many programs, and 
recording and reproduction systems using such disks as 
recording mediums will find their way into a wider 
variety of applications. Such moving-picture 
compression recording techniques include a system 
prescribed by ISO-11172 (MPEG). As the increased amount of recording information 
enables the use of more programs, a desire to check for 
the elapsed time during reproduction is getting 
stronger. In displaying the reproduction elapsed time, 
it is desired more that the reproduction elapsed time 
for more than one program or the time elapsed for the 
program now being reproduced appears on the screen. It 
is also desired that the remaining time for the current 
program is displayed during reproduction.  Accordingly, the object of the present invention is 
to provide a reproduction apparatus with a time display 
function capable of producing a time display by request 
on the basis of the time information recorded on the 
disk. The foregoing object is accomplished by providing a 
reproduction apparatus with a time display function, 
comprising: a disk in which a management area is formed 
in a portion of the disk and a data area is formed in 
another portion of the disk, a plurality of programs 
being recorded in the data area, each of the plurality 
of programs being composed of a plurality of data units, 
each of the data units containing video information, and 
absolute time information on the starts of the plurality 
of programs and relative time information within the 
programs on the starts of the plurality of data units 
being recorded in the management area; pickup beans for 
reading the information from the disk; demodulation 
means for demodulating the output signal of the pickup 
means; management information storage means for storing 
each piece of information in the management area 
outputted from the demodulation means; video decode 
means for decoding

In an apparatus for reproducing a disk in which 
a management area is formed in a portion of the disk and 

a data area is formed in another portion of the disk, a 
plurality of programs being recorded in said data area, 

each of said plurality of programs being composed of a 
plurality of data units, each of said data units 

containing video information, and absolute time 
information on the starts of said plurality of programs 

and relative time information within the programs on the 
starts of said plurality of data units being recorded in 

said management area, a reproduction apparatus with a 
time display function, comprising: 

   pickup means (103) for reading the information from 
said disk; 

   demodulation means (201) for demodulating the 
output signal of said pickup means; 

   management information storage means (204) for 
storing each piece of information in said management 

area outputted from said demodulation means; 
   video decode means (206) for decoding video 

information on said data unit outputted from said 
demodulation means; 

   time information processing means (204, S1-S5, 
S7-S10) for, in an absolute time display mode, obtaining 

absolute time information for display from said absolute 
time information on the program being reproduced and 

said relative time information on the data unit of the 
program being reproduced, and in a relative time display 

mode, obtaining relative time information for display 
from relative time information on the data unit of the 

program being reproduced with said absolute time 
information on the program being reproduced being set at 

0, and in a frame number display mode, identifying the
