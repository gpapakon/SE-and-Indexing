<ABSTRACT>
A pipe drilling tool including a first threaded pipe coupling 
(21) screwed to a collar (27) provided in a strapping 

tap (23, 24) affixed to a pipe (26), a second 
threaded pipe coupling (17) concentric to the former, and 

a threaded pipe (13) screwed within said second pipe coupling 
(17) and carrying at one end a control handle (10) 

and at the other end an interchangeable end drilling mill 
(15) for drilling the pipe (26) as a result of the rotation 

of said control handle (10). In order to drill a pipe 
under a liquid pressure, a pipe (13) provided with a cylindrical 

non-threaded part (13B) and a second different 
pipe coupling (17A) comprising sealing means on the non-threaded 

part (13B) of pipe (13) are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe drilling tool to 
quickly and exactly drill a hole into a pipe at a predetermined 
position. At the present state of art, upon applying a branch pipe 
to a pipe of PVC or other similar material a socalled 
"strapping tap" is used consisting of a threaded collar 
having an axis perpendicular to the axis of the pipe and 
carried by a pair of jaws which are tightly clamped around 
the main pipe at the desired point.
 
The branch pipe is screwed to said collar after having 
drilled the pipe where the collar is applied.
 
Since in most cases the installation of the strapping taps 
is carried out in locations remote from built-up areas, 
then without electric power, which prevents electric 
drills and/or other powered tools from being used, a pipe 
can be drilled at a desired point by resorting to empirical, 
coarse systems consisting in the use of chisels, 
hammers, punches, screwdriver and the like. Of course, the 
hole thus obtained is extremely imprecise, irregular, and 
in many cases insufficient apart from the fact that the 
residues of the thus drilled holes penetrate into the pipe 
and can cause clogging. The main object of the invention is of providing a 
portable tools of the above-mentioned type which can 
quickly and precisely drill a hole with a predetermined  
 
diameter, and allows the drilling offcut ("plug") to be 
recovered so as to avoid any problem of the above-mentioned 
type. In accordance with the invention there is provided a tool 
including a pair of threaded concentric pipe couplings, 
the outer pipe coupling being screwed to the inner thread 
of the collar of the strapping tap, and a threaded pipe 
screwed to the inner pipe coupling, said tool carrying 
also at the front end an end mill having an interchangeable 
drill and at the other end a control handle.
 
The drilling mill has a diameter corresponding to that of 
the hole to be drilled into the pipe, said mill being also 
hollow so as to hold inside the drilling offcut or plug 
caused when drilling the pipe.
 
Provided within the threaded pipe is a plug kick-off rod 
which is operated when the tool disengages from the collar 
of the strapping tap at the end of the drilling.
 
In order to allow pipes to be drilled in already operating 
plants, i.e. where liquids are present, without stopping 
the flow of the liquid, an alternative embodiment is provided 
in combination with a ball valve (of the commercial 
type) directly screwed to said collar of the strapping 
tap. This invention will now

<CLAIMS>
A pipe drilling tool for applying strapping taps to PVC 
pipes, in particular pipes for irrigation, wherein it includes 

in combination a pair of concentric threaded pipe 
couplings (17 or 17A, 21), a threaded pipe (13) carrying 

at one end an end drilling mill (15) for drilling pipe 
(26) at the desired position, and at the other end a control 

handle (10) associated to kick-off means for ejecting 
the drilling offcut (30). 
A tool as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
said pair of concentric threaded sleeve (17 or 17A, 21) 

are telescopically mounted and provided with knurled rings 
(18, 22) or means for the manual screwing. 
A tool as claimed in claim 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the diameters of outer pipe coupling (21) and end 

drilling mill (15) are varying as a function of the diameters 
of the main pipe (26), the branch pipe, and the hole 

to be drilled. 
A tool as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that one end of the outer pipe coupling (21) is provided 

with an outer threaded part (29) engaged to the inner 
threaded part (28) provided in collar (27) of the strapping 

tap. 
A tool as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that said threaded pipe includes a non-threaded cylindrical 

 
part (13B) between the threaded part (13) and the bottom 

end, and that pipe coupling (17A) screwed to pipe (13) 
has a guide (37) for said non-threaded part (13B), and 

that pipe coupling (17A) is provided with liquid-tight 
means. 
A tool as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
said liquid-tight means is formed of a packing gland (38) 

and a packing coupling (39) coaxial to guide (37) of pipe 
coupling (17A), and that said packing coupling (39) is 

tightened to provide the sealing between the elastic 
packing gland (38) and the non-threaded part (13B). 
A tool as claimed in claims 1 to 4 or 5 and 6, characterized 
in that the drilling mill is hollow so as to hold 

the drilling offcut (plug) (30) formed when drilling pipe
