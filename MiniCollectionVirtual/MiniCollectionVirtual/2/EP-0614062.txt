<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to expanded 
structures and more particularly but not exclusively to 
structures used to form compact heat exchangers suitable 
for high temperature or corrosive environments. Expanded structures have been used extensively in 
the past in forming aerospace components and heat 
exchanger cores. An expanded structure comprises two 
or more sheets of material suitably bonded and then 
deformed in order to form a structural or heat exchanger 
component. The materials are normally diffusion bonded 
together and may be creep formed, hot formed or 
superplastically deformed. In aerospace components the expanded structure 
provides added strength and rigidity without great weight 
gain. In heat exchangers, the expanded structure provides 
heat exchanger passages through which liquids and/or 
gases can flow. Several expanded structures are stacked 
to form the heat exchanger. Header or distribution 
elements are added to ensure separation of flow paths. An efficient and compact type of heat exchanger is 
known to have a plate and fin construction. Such 
construction has several layers of parallel plates spaced 
by thin elements in order to define heat exchanger 
passages. Liquids or gases are distributed along these 
passages by header arrangements at each end of the heat 
exchanger. There is a requirement for heat exchangers in high 
temperature and highly corrosive environments. 
Typically, these exchangers have been manufactured from 
stainless steel or titanium alloys. At present it is 
common practice to braze such alloys in order to 
fabricate the heat exchanger. However, use of brazing  
 
can limit the scope of application for the heat 
exchanger. The problem with brazing is that it introduces 
dissimilar materials into the heat exchanger. In some 
applications these dissimilar materials cause corrosion 
around the braze sites. Attempts have been made to 
remove brazing from the fabrication procedure by use of 
diffusion bonding and suitable deformation. One means of forming a heat exchanger or expanded 
structure by diffusion bonding techniques requires at 
least one plate of each layer to be screen printed with a 
stop off material in certain areas leaving other areas 
free in order to define required diffusion bonding at 
certain locations and areas within the heat exchanger or 
structure layer surface. Thus, the plates of the heat 
exchanger or structure are brought into intimate contact 
by high pressure and diffusion bonded in the areas where 
there is no stop off

<CLAIMS>
(1) An expanded structure for use in a heat exchanger 
or component manufacture formed from at least one 

expanded layer characterised in that each expanded layer 
has electron beam or laser weld lines in at least two 

juxtaposed sheets of deformable material and a 
superplastic, hot formed or creep deformed area between 

the weld lines to form expanded passages in the layer. 
(2) An expanded structure as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the structure has header elements coupled to the 

expanded passages to distribute liquid or gas to and from 
the expanded passages and allow the structure to operate 

as a heat exchanger. 
(3) An expanded structure as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
wherein the weld lines are parallel to one another. 
(4) An expanded structure as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 
wherein the expanded layers are grouped together by 

diffusion bonding. 
(5) An expanded structure as claimed in any proceeding 
claim wherein there are structure plates between expanded 

layers in the expanded structure. 
(6) A method of fabricating an expanded structure 
comprising; 


a. arranging at least two sheets of deformable 
material in juxtaposed position; 
b. either electron beam or laser welding the sheets to 
form weld lines therebetween; 
c. fabricating by creep or superplastic deformation or 
hot forming the sheets between the weld lines to create 

an expanded passage layer having fins; 
d. stacking several expanded passage layers and 
securing them together to form an expanded structure. 
(7) A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein once the 
expanded passage layers are secured together then header 

means are added to the expanded structure in order to 
 

allow the structure to act as a heat exchanger by 
distribution of liquids or gases in respective heat 

exchanger passage networks formed from the expanded 
passage layers. 
(8) A method as claimed in claim 6 or 7 wherein several 
pairs of sheets of deformable material are welded and 

fabricated together in one step to form structure bundles 
which are then secured together to produce the expanded 

structure. 
(9) A method as claimed in claim 6, 7 or 8 wherein the 
expanded passage layers are secured together by diffusion 

bonding.
