<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to muteins of amylin and derivatives thereof having insulin action suppressing activity as well as the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. The muteins and derivatives of this invention are useful for suppressing insulin action in muscle or muscle cells and for suppressing insulin action in a mammal in need thereof. Thus, this invention further relates to a method of suppressing insulin action in a mammal in need thereof and methods for suppressing insulin action in muscle or muscle cells as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising the above described muteins, derivatives or salts. This invention also relates to a method for assaying the ability of a compound to inhibit the suppression of insulin action in muscle or muscle cells caused by amylin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to muteins of amylin and derivatives thereof having insulin
action suppressing activity as well as the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof.
More specifically, this invention relates to muteins of human amylin, muteins of rat
amylin and derivatives thereof having insulin action suppressing activity as well as the
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. The muteins and derivatives of this invention
are useful for suppressing insulin action in muscle or muscle cells and for suppressing
insulin action in a mammal in need thereof. Thus, this invention further relates to a
method of suppressing insulin action in a mammal in need thereof and methods for
suppressing insulin action in muscle or muscle cells. Still further, this invention relates
to a method for assaying the ability of a compound to inhibit the suppression of insulin
action in muscle or muscle cells caused by amylin. Still further yet, this invention
relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the above described muteins,
derivatives or salts.Human amylin is a 37 amino acid polypeptide having a primary amino acid
sequence of
Rat amylin is a 37 amino acid polypeptide having a primary amino acid sequence
of
Amylin contains a disulfide bond between the Cys residues at positions 2 and 7.
It is a secretory product of pancreatic Î² cells. In the type II diabetic, there are extensive
deposits of amylin derived amyloid in the pancreas and it has been postulated that the
amyloid contributes to the pathology associated with the disease. Westermark, P., et 
al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140:827-831 (1986); Clark, A., et al., Lancet

127:414-417 (1987); Clark, A., et al., Diabetologia 33:285-289 (1990).In isolated soleus muscle, amylin suppresses insulin-stimulated glycogen
synthesis. Leighton, B., et al., Nature 335:632-635 (1988); Cooper, G. J. S., et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:7763-7766 (1988). The effect of amylin on insulin action in
skeletal muscle invivo has been reported to be the inhibition of glycogenesis which is
the major effect in isolated soleus muscle described above.The use of amylin and calcitonin gene-related peptide to reduce insulin
stimulated glycolysis in muscle or muscle cells and a method for assaying for
antagonists thereof are
