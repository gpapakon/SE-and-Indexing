<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a curable
organopolysiloxane composition containing a novel
adhesion promoter which imparts an adhesive character
to the composition which is durable under acidic
conditions.Addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane
compositions cure relatively rapidly at room
temperature or when heated. For this reason, they have
been broadly examined as protectants for metal
surfaces. These compositions are typically composed of
an organopolysiloxane that contains at least 2 alkenyl
groups in each molecule, an organopolysiloxane that
contains at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in
each molecule, and a hydrosilylation catalyst.However, these compositions generally exhibit
poor adhesion, and this deficiency has necessitated the
addition of an adhesion promoter to equip these
compositions with self-bondability. A variety of
adhesion promoters are known for this purpose. The
following have already been disclosed as curable
organopolysiloxane compositions with improved self-bonding
properties: JP-A 51-28309, JP-A 52-48146,
JP-A 1-85224, JP-A 54-80358, JP-A 48-75633, JP-A
61-72077.When cured at around 150Â°C, the curable
organopolysiloxane compositions disclosed in JP-A(s)
51-28309, 52-48146, 1-85224, exhibit an excellent
adhesiveness for substrates such as iron and aluminum,
but have an inadequate adhesiveness for substrates such
as nickel-plated substrates and copper. As a result,
delamination occurs rather easily when the adherent
composition bonded to these latter metals is treated
with an acidic aqueous solution. For the adhesion 
promoters taught in JP-A(s) 48-75633 and 61-72077,
foaming occurs when the addition reaction-curing
organopolysiloxane compositions are subjected to heat
curing because their adhesion promoters are extremely
unstable due to hydroxyl and/or silicon-bonded alkoxy
groups being in the molecule. US-A-4 357 440 discloses a new compound, 2-hydroxy-3-t-butylamino-1-propyl
methacrylate, and latex coating
compositions containing said compound as a wet-adhesion aid.JP-A-60231723 discloses a hydroxy alkylamine additive for
polyepoxy resins represented by the following formula:

wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be identical or different
groups and represent H, a 1 - 17C (un)saturated aliphatic
group, alicyclic group, aromatic group, heterocyclic group
or heterocycle residue except nitrogen bound by R1-R4,
wherein these groups may be substituted by halogen, nitro,
alkoxy, allyloxy or acetyl. The present invention introduces a highly
adhesive curable organopolysiloxane
