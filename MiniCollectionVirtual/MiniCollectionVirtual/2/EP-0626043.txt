<DESCRIPTION>
 LOAD INDICATING FASTENERSThis invention relates to load indicating fasteners.The invention relates in particular to fasteners, such as bolts or studs, which in use are subject to tensile loading. It is often important to ensure that the fastener is tightened to a predetermined loading. It is known to use the stretching of the fastener which occurs under tensile loading to give an indication when the appropriate loading has been reached.United States Patent No. "4.981.404 (Arrow Support Systems) describes a bolt having an axial cavity extending inwards from an end face of the bolt, the axial cavity having an upper portion with internal threads and a lower portion extending from the internal threads to the bottom of the cavity, and a gauging pin with external threads engaging the internal threads of the axial cavity and an unthreaded portion of the pin extending to the end of the cavity. The gauging pin has a portion which extends outwards beyond the end face of the bolt and terminates in a head having a pointer extending radially outwards above the face of the bolt, providing a load indicator assembly. The assembly is factory-set by applying a predetermined tensile load to the bolt, screwing down the gauging pin until its end engages the bottom of the cavity, marking the position of the pointer on the end face of the bolt and releasing the bolt from tension. On release of the tension, the bolt regains its original length, and the portion of the gauging pin between the threaded connection with the cavity and the end of the cavity is elastically compressed so that the pin is held against rotation. The bolt is then shipped to the user. In use, when the 

tension applied to the bolt reaches the predetermined level, the compression on the pin is released and the pin is free to move in the direction of a lower stress level, indicating that the predetermined load has been reached. If the load is increased further, the cavity is further elongated, allowing the gauging pin to be turned beyond the mark on the face of the bolt, in the direction of a higher stress level. A pin set into the end face of the bolt is positioned to engage the pointer of the gauging pin, to prevent the gauging pin moving more than 180 to either side of the mark on the end face indicating the . predetermined loading.The bolt of the U.S. patent therefore provides an indicator assembly which shows when the predetermined loading has been reached, and also shows if the predetermined loading has been exceeded. A disadvantage with the bolt of

CLAIMS:
1. A load indicating fastener comprising a body having a shank which is subject to tensile loading in use, the body having a bore which extends axially from an end face of the body into the shank and which is adapted to receive a gauge pin, the gauge pin having a threaded portion adapted to engage a complementary threaded portion of the bore so that rotation of the gauge pin effects axial movement between the gauge pin and the body of the fastener, the threaded portion of the gauge pin being spaced from a part of the gauge pin which is adapted to contact part of the body of the fastener to stop movement of the gauge pin as it is screwed into the body of the fastener, the gauge pin protruding outwards beyond the end face of the fastener and having a head by which the pin can be rotated, and markings being provided on the head and the end face of the fastener to indicate the position of the gauge pin when the said part of the pin is in contact with the said part of the bore when the shank of the fastener is subject to a predetermined tensile loading, the gauge pin being free to rotate so that the gauge pin can be withdrawn from the fastener by rotating the pin to release the engagement between the threaded portion of the pin and the complementary threaded portion of the bore.
2. A fastener as claimed in Claim 1, in which the threaded portion of the bore is positioned near the end face of the fastener and the threaded portion of the gauge pin is spaced from the inner end of the gauge pin, so that as the gauge pin is screwed into the body of the fastener rotation of the gauge pin is stopped when the end of the gauge 


pin contacts the inner end of the bore, the markings on the head and the end face of the fastener indicating the position of the gauge pin when the end of the pin is in contact with the inner end of the bore when the shank of the fastener is subject to the said predetermined tensile loading.
3. A fastener as claimed in Claim 2, in which the fastener is pre-set to provide an indication at the said predetermined tensile load by applying the predetermined tensile load to the shank of the fastener, rotating the gauge pin until the end of the pin contacts the inner end of the bore, marking the end face of the fastener and/or the head to provide the said markings, rotating the pin to withdraw the end of the pin from the inner end of the bore and releasing the load on the shank.
4. A fastener as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3. in which the markings on the head of the gauge pin and the end face of the fastener comprise a pointer on the head of the pin projecting above the end face of the fastener and a mark on the end face of the fastener.
5. A fastener as claimed in one of Claims 2 to , in which the end of the gauge pin is substantially flat, and a rigid ball is positioned between the end of the gauge pin and the inner end of the bore in the fastener.
6. An assembly comprising a fastener as claimed in any preceding claim, with the gauge pin withdrawn from the fastener.
7. An assembly comprising a plurality of fasteners as claimed in any preceding claim and a single gauge pin common to all the fasteners, each fastener having been pre-set, using the single gauge pin, to provide an indication at the predetermined tensile loading when the gauge pin is.

in use, inserted into the bore in the fastener.
8. An assembly comprising a plurality of fasteners as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 and a number of identical gauge pins, each fastener having been pre-set, using one of the gauge pins, to provide an indication at the predetermined tensile loading when any of the gauge pins is, in use, inserted into the bore in the fastener. . A method of pre-setting a fastener as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5. comprising the steps of applying a predetermined tensile load to the shank of the fastener, rotating the gauge pin until the end of the pin contacts the inner end of the bore, marking the end face of the fastener and/or the head to provide the said markings, rotating the pin to withdraw the end of the pin from the inner end of the bore and releasing the load on the shank.
