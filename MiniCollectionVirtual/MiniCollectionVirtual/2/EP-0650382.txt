<ABSTRACT>
The device for producing a micro-plug connector component (24, 30) consists of a cylindrical outer sleeve (1), a cylindrical central component (2) arranged coaxially in the outer sleeve (1) and several cylindrical spacers (3) arranged between the outer sleeve (1) and the central component (2). Between two adjacent spacers (3) there are cylindrical fitting components (4) which contact the adjacent spacers (3), the central component (2) and the outer sleeve (1). The fitting components (4) are long enough to project from the arrangement consisting of the outer sleeve (1), central component (2) and spacers (3). The micro-plug connector component (24, 30) produced with the device can be used for an electric power supply line (32). The contact components (5, 13) of the micro-plug connectors (24, 30) are connected to electric conductors (20) which, together with the micro-plug connector (24, 30), are surrounded by a continuous polyurethane.
