<ABSTRACT>
Sliding device for tarpaulins of lorries (transport vehicles), including a guide rail (2) in which a slider (1) moves:   a) each guide rail (2) includes two identical rail/mortices (21) in a symmetrical arrangement, each of them in turn defining several running tracks arranged symmetrically in pairs in a plane which is orthogonal relative to the previous one; b) each slider (1) includes a base support (11) provided with pairs of wheels (2) arranged with double total symmetry, both relative to their faces and relative to one and the same face.

A sliding device for lorry canopies, which uses guide-rails 
(2) along which the slides (1) with wheels (R) move, with 

each slide (1) being made up of a supporting base (11) with 
two pairs of wheels (R), and each air of wheels made up in 

such a way that its component wheels have a common axle and 
are arranged symmetrically about a first central plane (TT) 

perpendicular to the said common axle, 

with all the pairs of wheels (R) having the same first 
intermediate plane (TT), 
with the pairs of wheels (R) arranged on both sides of a 
second intermediate plane (TT2) perpendicular to the first 

intermediate plane (TT) and to a third intermediate plane 
(TT1) containing the common axles of the first and second 

pair of wheels (R), with the said guide rail (2) supporting 
two identical rail mortises (21) symmetrically arranged on 

either side of the said first intermediate plane (TT), with 
each rail mortise defining two raceways arranged on either 

side of the said third intermediate pane (TT1). 
with the device being characterized by the fact that:
 
each raceway has a polyhedral configuration which defines 

several raceways (211, 212, 213) and is capable of defining 
a housing approximately along the profile of the wheels (R) 

which move on it, with the raceways of the same rail mortise 
being symmetrical to each other with respect to the third 

intermediate plane (TT1).
