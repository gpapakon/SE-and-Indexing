<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a production method for
for zeolite β useful as an adsorbent or catalyst.Zeolite β is a substance presented in the
specification of USP 3,308,069 for the first time. The
feature of the synthetic method disclosed in that patent
is to coexist (contact) tetraethylammonium (R) ions with
silica source, alumina source, alkali source and water at
a molar ratio of R2O/SiO2 of not less than 0.15:1.
However, the tetraethylammonium compound is very 
unstable and expensive.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Sho 61-281015
shows that the synthesis of zeolite β is possible
even if tetraethylammonium ions are used at a R2O/SiO2
molar ratio as low as 0.01:1 to 0.1:1. However, if
attempting to synthesize zeolite β in a system containing
such a small quantity of tetraethylammonium ions, then it
may take 6 days for crystallisation period, even if
crystallizing at 150°C in the presence of seed crystal.On the other hand, M.A. Camblor et al produced
zeolite β within 30 hours at 135°C as reported in
ZEOLITES, 1991, Vol. 11, p. 202 and p. 792, using amorphous
silica, 40 % aqueous solution of tetraethylammonium
hydroxide, sodium aluminate, aluminum, sodium hydroxide,
potassium hydroxide, etc.Moreover, attempts to produce zeolite β using other
organic compounds in place of tetraethylammonium ions are
proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
Sho 60-235714 and No. Sho 60-235715. However, all the
substances used in these proposals are special organic
compounds, which are difficult to obtain.The purpose of the invention is to provide a method
wherein lower amounts of tetraethylammonium compound can
be used, only common raw materials are necessary as the
raw materials other than the tetraethylammonium compound
for the synthesis of zeolite, and yet zeolite β can be
produced in short time under mild conditions.According to the present invention a method for
producing 
zeolite β comprises the steps of contacting an aqueous
solution of alkali metal silicate and an aqueous solution
containing aluminium at a fixed ratio thereof under
stirring, under conditions of temperature of 0 to 55°C
and pH of 5 to 9, separating granular amorphous
aluminosilicate having composition molar ratios of
ingredients as oxides in the following ranges:
SiO2/Al2O3 10 ∼ 200 (10:1 to 200:1) andM2O/Al2O3 0.8 ∼ 1.2 (0.8:1 to 1.2:1)
(wherein M means an alkali metal), and contacting said
granular amorphous aluminosilicate with alkali metal
hydroxide, tetraethylammonium compound and water at molar
ratios as oxide in
