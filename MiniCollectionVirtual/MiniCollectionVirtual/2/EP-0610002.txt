<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mold for
injection molding of a thermoplastic resin according to the
precharacterising part of claim 1.A mold of this type is known from e.g. JP-A-55-55 839.The present invention further relates to a process for
fabricating thermoplastic resin articles.The known molds used for fabricating thermoplastic
resin articles are made of metals such as
conventional steel, nickel, nickel alloys, aluminum,
aluminum alloys, copper, copper alloys, etc. A molten
resin is introduced into a cavity under pressure to be
molded to a predetermined shape and size. In this
molding technique, generally a more precise article
with good appearance can be obtained compared with
other molding techniques such as blow molding, etc.However, in the case where the article is
fabricated by injection molding, using such a conventional
mold, the pattern on the cavity surface is
difficult to be transferred to the article without
blurring or losing its original fineness and gloss. If
such blurring occurs in the pattern transferred to the
article, the appearance of the article is spoiled, and
its commercial value is lost. In addition, weld lines
and flow marks are likely to remain on the surface of
the article, as well as sink marks are likely to remain
near an end part or on thick wall portions of the 
article.In order to solve the above-mentioned problems,
generally, the temperature of the mold or the
injection pressure is increased. However, there is a
limit to the improvement of the transfer accuracy even
though the temperature of the mold is increased. In
addition, the increase in temperature of the mold leads
to a prolonged cycle time of molding. Thus, satisfactory
results cannot be obtained. As for the increase
in injection pressure, there is also a limit to the
improvement of the transfer accuracy. The increase in
injection pressure causes warpage due to residual
strain, and causes much flashing, etc., resulting in
degraded quality of articles. Moreover, the increase
in injection pressure needs the enlargement of a molding
machine, and the strengthening of the mold. Accordingly,
this makes it difficult to economically
fabricate satisfactory articles.The reasons for the limit to the quality
improvement of the article using a conventional mold
are as follows:The mold for injection molding is made of
metals which generally have good thermal conductivity.
When a molten resin is introduced and comes into contact
with the cavity surface, the molten resin gives
off heat to the cavity surface with rapid
