<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMERIC FILM-BASED ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR APPARATUSThis invention relates generally to electrochemical apparatus and methods for detecting ionizable compounds.*>5 Electrochemical detectors or sensors have been known for many years. One early sensor has electrodes forming a part of the electrochemical cell or couple and which are separated by means of a porous layer. The porous layer permits a restricted flow of electrolyte, thereby completing the electrochemical circuit between the electrodes in the sensor. Although the upscale response of this sensor is excellent, large reservoirs of electrolyte are typically10 required to be maintained. In addition, the porous layer permits a substantial diffusion of sample and of all the constituents thereof throughout the electrolyte. The result is the possibility of contamination or poisoning of the electrodes, and of direct interference in the quantitative measurement by substances present in the sample other than those being determined.15 A second sensor utilizes a static electrolyte and a permeable barrier to retain the electrolyte. Less electrolyte is for this reason required, but in the event of relatively large concentrations being encountered of the substance to be determined, the electrolyte again can be infused with that substance. The permeable barrier, however, hinders the quick recovery of the sensor after this infusion.20 Another type of prior art electrochemical detector which has found wide acceptance and good success in the chemical process industry uses a static liquid electrolyte and an ion-exchange membrane to prevent the electrolyte from being contaminated with the substance to be detected. One such liquid electrolyte electrochemical sensor is described in United States Patent No. 4,333,810 to Wolcott, issued June 8, 1982.25 However, liquid electrolyte electrochemical sensors even as described in the '810 patent have still required frequent maintenance checks. There is also a susceptibility to leaks if the detectors become inverted or require mounting in an inverted position, or if the detectors are needed in non-ambient pressure or vacuum situations or environments, or in high temperature environments.30 A different type of electrochemical sensor is described in United States Patent No.4,948,490 to Venkatasetty, wherein an electrochemically stable, non-hygroscopic, ionically- conducting solid electrolyte film is used in an environmental sensor. The film includes a tetraalkylammonium salt with an organic polymeric complexing material as a
