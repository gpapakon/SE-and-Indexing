with potassium cyanide to give a cyanoalkyl radical, by reaction with sodium azide to give
an azidoalkyl radical, by reaction with an amine to give an aminoalkyl radical or by reaction

with thiourea to give an amidinothioalkyl radical;
q) an alkylthioalkyl radical R
1
 and/or R
2
 in a compound of general formula (I) or (III) can
be oxidised to give an alkylsulphinylalkyl or alkylsulphonylalkyl radical; or also
C) as described for the radicals R
1
 and/or R
2
 in a compound of general formula (I) or (III), the
radicals R
3
 to R
10
 in compounds of general formula (I) or (III) can be functionally modified,
whereby


a) radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for nitro groups can be reduced by known methods to give
radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for amino groups;
b) radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for methoxy radicals can be convened by ether cleavage
or radical R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for benzyloxy radicals can be convened by catalytic
hydrogenation into radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for hydroxyl groups;
c) radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for hydroxyl groups can subsequently again be alkylated,
acylated or aminoalkylated;
d) radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for amino groups can be alkylated or acylated;
e) radicals R
3
 to R
10
 which stand for alkylthio radicals can be oxidised to radicals R
3
 to R
10

which strand for alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl radicals; or also
f) compounds of general formula (I) or (1ll), in which one or two of the radicals R
3
 to R
10

stand for C1-C4-alkyl, C1,-C4-acyl, chlorine, bromine or nitro can be prepared by known
methods of electrophilic aromatic substitution from compounds of general formula (I) or

(III) in which the radicals R
3
 to R
10
 in question are hydrogen atoms.
Medicines containing at least one compound of general formula (I) according to any one of
claims 1 to 11 as well as conventional adjutants and additive materials.
Use of compounds of the general formula I according to claims 1 to 11 for the productions
of medicines for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer, virus diseases (e.g. HIV infections),

heart and blood vessel diseases (e.g. high blood pressure, thromboses, heart rhythm disturbances
arteriosclerosis), bronchopulmonary diseases, degenerative disease of the central nervous system 

(e.g. Alzheimer's disease), inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatism or arthritis), diseases of the
immune systems (e.g. allergies), as well as psoriasis or use as an immune suppressant.
