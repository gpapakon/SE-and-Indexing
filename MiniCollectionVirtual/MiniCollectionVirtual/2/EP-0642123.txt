<ABSTRACT>
According to this invention, there is provided an 
information recording medium including a substrate 

(10), a metal layer (11) formed on the substrate (10), 
and a recording layer (13) formed on the metal layer 

(11) and being formed a recorded portion and a non-recorded 
portion by changing optical characteristics by 

radiating a recording light beam, wherein the recording 
layer contains GeSbTe, a reflectance of the recorded 

portion of the recording layer (13) is higher than that 
of the non-recorded portion, and a reflectance of the 

non-recorded portion is not less than 10%. Focusing and 
tracking operations can be stably performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording medium according to the preamble of claim 1.A conventional recordable/erasable information
recording medium includes a substrate, a first protective
layer, a recording layer, a second protective
layer, and a reflecting layer.When a recording/erasing operation is to be performed
using such an information recording medium, a
light beam is radiated on the entire surface of the
information recording medium to heat the information
recording medium at a temperature lower than the melting
point of the material of the recording layer, thereby
setting the material of a recording layer in a high
crystallinity (a state in which atoms are relatively
regularly arranged; to be referred to as a crystalline
state hereinafter).. Strong pulse light having a short
wavelength is radiated on the information recording
medium to heat and melt the recording layer, and the
recording layer is rapidly cooled. In this manner, part
on which the pulse light is radiated has a low
crystallinity (a state in which an atomic arrangement is
disturbed; to be referred to as an amorphous state
hereinafter).As described above, since the crystalline and
amorphous states have different atomic arrangement
structures, these states have different optical 
characteristics such as transmittances or reflectances.
Information can be recorded by using the difference
between the optical characteristics. Information
recorded as described above can be erased as follows.
That is, weak pulse light having a long wavelength is
radiated on the recorded portion to heat the recorded
portion to a temperature which is equal to or lower than
the melting point of the material constituting the
recording layer, and the recorded portion is gradually
cooled. This is because the state of the material of
the recorded portion is returned to the original state,
i.e., the crystalline state.In an actual information recording medium, a change
in reflectance between the crystalline state and the
amorphous state is used as a signal as described above.
For this reason, the thickness of each layer is designed
in consideration of the optical interference effects of
the interface between the protective layer and the
recording layer and the interface between the protective
layer and the reflecting layer. Therefore, according to
the optical constants of the materials used in the
information recording medium, there are optimal
thicknesses capable of obtaining a large change in
reflectance.The following fact is known. That is,
