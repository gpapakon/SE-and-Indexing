According to the present invention, a multi-layer high 
critical temperature superconductor wire includes a silver 

substrate. Layers of superconductor material and silver

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a method of manufacturing a high critical
temperature superconductor wire.
More particularly, the present invention
pertains to methods for manufacturing high critical
temperature superconductor devices which transmit
electrical current over relatively long distances. The
present invention is particularly, but not exclusively,
useful as a continuous manufacturing process for the
fabrication of relatively long high temperature
superconductor wires which can be incorporated into
transmission cables or into the windings of superconducting
magnets.Recently discovered high temperature superconductors
have, for some time now, been seriously considered by many
for their potential applications in a variety of
technologies. Heretofore, however, for many applications
the transmission of electrical current over superconductor
circuits has been limited by the inability to manufacture
long lengths of high temperature superconducting wire. The
challenge here has been at least twofold. First, there is
the problem of properly orienting the superconductor grains
along the entirety of the desired operational length.
Second, there is the problem of supporting the
superconductor during its manufacture, and subsequently
supporting the superconductor in its intended operational
environment.Several methods for the manufacture of superconductor
devices have been suggested. For example, U.S. Patent No.
5,118,663, which issued to Woolf et al. for an invention
entitled "Fabrication of Silver Coated High Temperature
Ceramic Superconductor Fiber with Metal Substrate", and
which is assigned to the same assignee as the present
invention, discloses a method for electrophoretically 
coating a metal substrate with superconductor material.
The Woolf et al. '663 patent, however, does not suggest how
the superconducting capability of the end product might be
further enhanced by subsequent treatment of the coated
substrate. See also, U.S. Patent No. 5,073,240 which
issued to Raggio et al. for an invention entitled
"Anhydrous Electrophoretic Silver Coating Technique", and
which is also assigned to the assignee of the present
invention. In another example of a superconductor device,
U.S. Patent No. 5,104,849, which issued to Shiga et al. for
an invention entitled "Oxide Superconductor and Method of
Manufacturing the Same", discloses a multi-layer
superconductor which incorporates laminated layers of
prepared material. The Shiga et al. '849 patent, however,
does not teach or suggest any means, other than
