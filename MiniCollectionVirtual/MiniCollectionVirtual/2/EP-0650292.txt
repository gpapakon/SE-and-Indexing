<ABSTRACT>
An image pickup apparatus is provided with a 
visual line detecting device for detecting the position of 

a fixation point of the eye of the operator obtained 
within the image plane of an electronic viewfinder (6) which 

displays an image of an object of shooting, and an image 
processing circuit for processing and enlarging the image 

with the detected position of the fixation point as the 
center of the enlarging action.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image pickup
apparatus such as a camera-integrated type VTR.The recent advancement of video apparatuses such
as camera-integrated type VTRs, etc., is conspicuous. In
the case of the camera-integrated type VTRs, for example,
they are now arranged to have many functions including an
automatic focusing (abbreviated to AF) function, an
automatic exposure (abbreviated to AE) function and other
functions such as zooming at a high magnification zooming,
electronic zooming which enlarges images by electronic
image processing, etc., and to have improved operability.
Meanwhile, an electronic viewfinder (abbreviated to EVF)
is regularly used to display various kinds of messages as
well as to permit monitoring picked-up images.Fig. 1 is a block diagram schematically showing
by way of example the structure of a camera-integrated
type VTR of the above-stated kind. Referring to Fig. 1,
an object of shooting is imaged and focused through a lens
59 on the image pickup plane of an image sensor 51 which
is a CCD or the like imager. The image is photo-electrically
converted by the image sensor 51 and is
outputted as a picked-up image signal. The picked-up
image signal is sampled'and held by a sample-and-hold
(abbreviated to S/H) circuit 52. The sampled and held 
image signal is supplied to a gamma correction and AGC
(automatic gain control) circuit 53. The image signal is
gamma-corrected and has its gain automatically controlled
by the gamma correction and AGC circuit 53. The signal
thus processed is supplied to a TV-AF (television-AF)
circuit 54 to be converted into an electrical signal
indicating the state of blur of the image. More
specifically, at the TV-AF circuit 54, a high frequency
component of the picked-up image signal is extracted by
converting the electrical signal outputted from the gamma
correction and AGC circuit 53 into the differentiated
waveform the frequency band of which is limited. The high
frequency component thus extracted from the picked-up
image signal is used as a focus evaluation value. Hence,
the larger the peak value of the signal outputted from the
TV-AF circuit 54, the closer a state of the lens 59 to an
in-focus point. The lens 59 is driven in the direction in
which the peak value of the signal outputted from the TV-AF
circuit 54 increases. Following this, the analog
signal outputted from the TV-AF circuit 54 is supplied to
an A/D (analog-to-digital) converter 55 to be converted
into a digital signal. The digital signal is supplied to
a microcomputer 56. Then,
