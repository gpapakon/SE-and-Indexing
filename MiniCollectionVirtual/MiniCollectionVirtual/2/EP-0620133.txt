<ABSTRACT>
An air filter, in particular for the ventilation of the interior of motor vehicles, is proposed. Said air filter comprises a housing 10 which is provided with an untreated-air inlet and a clean-air outlet 11. Situated in the housing 10 is a filter element 18, which is folded in a zig-zag manner and has a peripheral sealing element 19. The untreated-air-side inlet of the housing 10 corresponds to the cross-section of the filter element 18. For fastening the filter element 18 holders 16,17 are arranged on the housing 10 via hinges 22,23, which holders secure the filter element 18 in its installed position.
