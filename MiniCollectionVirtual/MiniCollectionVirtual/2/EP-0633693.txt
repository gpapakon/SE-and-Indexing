<ABSTRACT>
A video data is accompanied or multiplexed with one or 
more flags indicating a relation between fields or frames of 

video data for transmission or recording. An interlace flag 
determines whether the video data is interlaced or not. A 

still image flag determines whether the video data carries a 
motion image, a field still image, or a frame still image. 

A frame change flag determines whether or not a given frame 
of the still image is identical to its previous frame. At 

least one of the three different flags is multiplexed with 
its relevant video data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording apparatus
for transmitting or recording a video signal and to a reproducing
apparatus for reproducing the video signal.It is known that the conventional television signals
are transmitted or recorded on a frame by frame basis. Each
frame comprises two fields in which a horizontal scanning
line of one field falls between two adjacent horizontal
lines of the other field in the. frame. This is called as
interlaced scanning.Accordingly, the video signal is transmitted or recorded
as interlaced signals in a video signal transmitting or
recording apparatus. For reproduction of the video signal,
the two fields are interlaced to one frame. The frame by
frame basis recording, transmission, or reproduction is
applicable to not only a motion image but also a still or
slow-motion image.However, there are some drawbacks with such conventional
video signal recording or reproducing apparatus:
(1) In common home video game machines, two corresponding
horizontal lines of their respective fields of a frame
are allocated to the same location on a screen for preventing 
flicker caused by interlacing of the two fields. They
are thus called non-interlaced fields. If such a non-interlaced
video signal transmitted or recorded is interlaced
in reproduction, it will produce flicker.(2) For a still image shot by a camera, each field of
its data is temporarily stored in a memory and then transmitted
or recorded for a plurality of field periods. Such
still image data will also produce flicker when interlaced
and reproduced, similar to the non-interlaced signal of the
paragraph (1).(3) While a recorded TV signal is reproduced in a
slow-motion or still mode, a single field of its data is
continuously pulled for a plurality of field periods. Such
slow-motion or still .image data after transmitted or recorded
will produce flicker when interlaced and reproduced, as
well as the still image data of the paragraph (2).(4) If still images and motion images are recorded in a
combination, they will hardly be discriminated from each
other during the reproduction. Also, it will be difficult
to determine whether a still or slow-motion image is reproduced
on a frame by frame basis or a field by field basis.(5) When an error occurs during the reproduction of a
still image, it is generally eliminated by error concealment.
However, since two consecutive frames are not always
correlated, a technique of inter-frame concealment can
unsuccessfully be used. If the inter-frame concealment is
enforced, the
