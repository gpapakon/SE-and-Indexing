<DESCRIPTION>
From the dawn of recorded history many substances
have been used for the purpose of sexual enhancement.
Some of these have known success and their reputations
have been passed down through the millennia. Even
though none of these substances have survived the
rigors of scientific scrutiny the pursuit for an
aphrodisiac continues. As long as humans place value
on optimal sexual functioning, there will be a demand
for sex-enhancing drugs.This invention relates to the use of hydriodic
acid in an aqueous solution as an aphrodisiac to
heighten sexual desire.This invention is based upon the discovery that an
aqueous solution of hydriodic acid (hydriodic solution)
can heighten sexual desire and, as such, can be used as
an aphrodisiac.Hydriodic acid is also known as anhydrous
hydriodic acid, hydrogen iodide, hydrogen monoiodide or
hydriodic. At normal temperature, hydriodic acid is a
colorless and nonflammable gas. See The Merck Index,
Merck & Co., Inc. (Tenth Edition 1983).The hydriodic acid solution of the present
invention consists of hydriodic acid in purified water
and dextrose. It has now been discovered that an aqueous
solution of hydriodic acid has aphrodisiac activity as
confirmed through its use by a female human. After the
oral administration of the hydriodic acid solution, an
aphrodisiac effect was experienced by said female.The term "aphrodisiac" or "heightened sexual
desire", for purposes of the present invention, refers
to the following physical manifestations of ingesting
the hydriodic solution, increased vaginal secretion,
clitoral swelling, nipple erection, contraction of
vaginal musculature and a general tingling sensation.The invention will be further illustrated by the
following non-limiting Exemplification:Hydriodic acid solution was purchased from Eli
Lilly and Company, of Indianapolis, Indiana, referred
to as hydriodic acid syrup. The hydriodic acid syrup
is prepared by mixing 140 ml of hydriodic acid with 550
ml of purified water and dissolving 450 g of dextrose
into the mixture.The solution was orally administered to a female human 52 years
age, weighing 74.8 kg. About 2.5 ml - 15 ml (.5-3 teaspoons) of the
hydriodic syrup was placed into 240 ml (8 ounces) tap water and then
ingested. An aphrodisiac effect, as defined above, was experienced within
approximately 24 hours.It is understood that higher or lower amounts and
concentrations of the hydriodic solution would be used
for heavier or lighter subjects as in the purview of
one skilled in the art. It should be, as well, understood that
