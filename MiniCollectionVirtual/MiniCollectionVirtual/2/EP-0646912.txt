<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical recording medium
which forms a color image by irradiation with light, more
specifically to an optical recording medium which is superior
in resistance of the recorded image to oil and plasticizer,
storage stability to heat, small in fogging of background,
and heat stability of background.Thermal recording is a direct recording method which
does not require development or fixing, and is widely used
in facsimile and printers. However, since, in this method,
a thermal head or thermal IC pen as a heating element is
contacted directly with the thermal recording paper, a color
developing melt or the like tends to adhere to the heating
element, resulting in a degraded recording function.Further, a thermal recording method using a thermal
head is limited in increasing the density of the heating
element, the resolution is typically about 10/mm, and
recording of a higher density is difficult.Then, a noncontacting recording method by light is
proposed as a method for further improving the resolution 
without degrading the recording function.Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (OPI) 58-148776
discloses that thermal recording is possible using a carbon
dioxide laser as a recording light source, by converging and
scanning the laser light on the thermal recording paper.
This recording method requires a high laser output power in
spite of the fact that the thermal recording paper absorbs
the oscillation wavelength of the carbon dioxide laser. The
recording apparatus is impossible to be designed compact
partly because of the use of a gas laser, and has a problem
in fabrication cost.Further, since conventional thermal recording medium is
hard to absorb light in the visible and near-infrared
regions, when a laser having an oscillation wavelength in
the visible or near-infrared region, a required heat energy
cannot be obtained unless the laser output power is
increased to a great extent.In addition, an optical recording medium comprising a
combination of a conventional thermal recording material and
a light absorbent material is proposed in Japanese OPls 54-4142,
57-11090, 58-94494, 58-209594, and so on.Japanese OPI 54-4142 discloses that in a thermal
recording medium having a substrate coated thereon with a
thermal recording layer mainly comprising a leuco dye, using
a metal compound having a lattice defect, the metal compound
absorbs light of the visible or infrared region to convert
it to heat, thereby enabling thermal recording. Japanese 
OPI 57-11090 describes an optical
