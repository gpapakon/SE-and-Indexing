<ABSTRACT>
An optical switching device with switch elements (224) similar to 
digital micromirror devices (DMD). The switching element (224) resides in a 

trench (216) between two elevated areas on the substrate (214a, 214b). 
Sending and receiving fibers (218a, 218b) face each other across the trench 

(216) with the switch element (224) between them. When the switch is ON, 
light travels through lenses (220a, 220b) in the trench (216) from one fiber 

(218b) to the other (218a). When the switch is flipped OFF, the element 
(224) is activated and blocks the light from the sending fiber (218b) by 

reflecting or absorbing the light from the sending fiber (218b). The switch is 
activated and possibly deactivated by addressing electrodes (226a, 226b) 

under the element (224), which deflects through an air gap towards the 
activated electrode (226b). For better deflection angles the posts can be 

arranged closer to one end of the element than the other. An alternate hinge 
architecture is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical switching, more particularly to
an optical switching device capable of
substantially allowing or blocking the passage of light therethrough.Optical switches are typically of two types: ON/OFF and routing.
Routing switches such as those shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,155,778 and
5,846,863, can connect an input to any one of several outputs. ON/OFF
switches, such as those shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,178,728 and 5,846,863,
make or break the optical connection between a single input and a single
output. Although routing switches are more optically efficient, because all
available light is put to use, they are more difficult to manufacture and align
optically than ON/OFF switches. One structure that is particularly
adaptable to both uses is the digital micromirror device (DMD), because of its
fast switching time and relative ease of manufacture.ON/OFF switches fall into two further categories. Shutter switches
block and unblock the optical path between the input and output. This
blocking can be performed in many ways. The two most common are altering
the transmission characteristics of the optical medium between input and
output. Steering switches steer light from the input fiber into or out of the
output fiber. These switches, like routing switches, are more difficult to
manufacture and align optically than shutter switches. Typically, the shutter switches have far less loss than the steering
switches. They normally operate with the DMD element, a highly reflective,
individually addressable micromirror, being inserted or brought into
proximity of the fibers to turn the switch OFF. When the switch must pass
light, the metal element remains away from the fiber and the light travels
with relatively low loss. Additionally, since the switch operates within the
fiber, there is no alignment problems, which can also lead to loss.The steering switches typically only pass light from fiber to fiber if the
DMD is ON. In one arrangement, the optical system is configured with the
input and output fibers mounted at an angle to each other. The DMD is
arranged at the intersection of the optical paths of the sending and receiving
fiber, and light is bounced off of an ON DMD and to the receiving fiber.
Another arrangement consists of a DMD arranged "over" the two fibers, so
the light must be reflected out of the plane of the fibers and bounced off of an
ON DMD element back to the plane of the receiving fiber. This contributes to
loss, both from misalignment, which becomes a far greater

An optical switching device capable of substantially

device comprising:

a substrate (110; 210) comprising a lowered portion (116;
216) and elevated areas (114a, 114b; 214a, 214b) on both

sides of said lowered portion (116; 216),
a first optical fiber (118b; 218b) arranged on the elevated
portion (114b; 214b) on one side of the lowered portion

(116; 216),
a second fiber (118a; 218a) arranged on the elevated

pivotally movable between a first position in which the

light path between the fibers (118a, 118b; 218a, 218b) is
unobstructed by said switching element (124; 224) so that

light can pass between the fibers (118a, 118b; 218a, 218b) 
and a second position in which said light path is

substantially blocked by said switching element (124; 224);
