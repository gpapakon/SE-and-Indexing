<ABSTRACT>
A process for quality control during the fabrication of a multiplicity of threads in a corresponding number of fabrication stations (4, 5, 5') identical to one another is disclosed. In this, at least one signal (10, 10', 10'') is recorded simultaneously and continuously at all the fabrication stations (4, 5, 5') of such a plant, and at least one additional signal (7, 8, 9, 11) is determined at one or a few fabrication stations (4), the so-called reference stations. By correlating all the recorded signals in these reference stations, with a knowledge of the mutual dependencies which may exist, the correlation result is evaluated in terms of one or more typical properties of the fabricated product. Parameters for the further influencing of the process at the reference station and statements regarding the quality of the product can be obtained therefrom.

Procedure for quality control in the production of a 
plurality of yarns in a corresponding number of 

production points of the same type, using the 
following steps: 


continuous, simultaneous measurement of at 
least one process parameter (10, 10', 10") 

at each production point of the 
installation, 
comparison of a process parameter (10, 10', 
10") or of a characteristic quantity, 

derived from a process parameter (10, 10', 
10"), of at least one production point (4), 

selected as a reference point, with the 
corresponding predefined setpoint value or 

reference characteristic quantity, 
determination of a correcting quantity on 
the basis of the comparison, 
control of all production points using the 
determined correcting quantity. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
at least one additional process parameter (7, 8, 9, 

11) is measured on at least one production point, and 
preferably few production points, as reference points, 

and all measured process parameters (7 - 11) and/or 
characteristic quantities derived from them are 

correlated at this reference point (4), or these few 
reference points, in knowledge of any interdependences 

which might exist. 
Procedure according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the correcting quantities (12, 13, ...) of the  

 
individual process parameters are the input quantities 

for a control circuit (17) at the reference point or 
points (4). 
Procedure according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, characterized 
in that the correcting quantities (12, 13, ...) are 

identical for all production points (5, 5', ...). 
Procedure according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that tolerance bands around the respective mean values 

of the measurement parameters are predefined as 
allowable value ranges of the process parameters in 

the reference point or points (4) and the production 
points (5, 5', ...). 
Procedure according to Claim 5, characterized in that, 
in the event of departure from the allowable value 

range of one of the process parameters in the 
reference point or points (4) and/or in one or more of 

the production points (5, 5', ...), the respective 
production point is switched off or identified as 

faulty. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the product-specific characteristics to be achieved by 

the production process are primarily predefined, in 
each individual production point, with regard to the 

required uniformity of the production output in all 
production points (4, 5, 5', ...) and the quality of 

the produced yarn or produced bobbin. 
Procedure according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
different process parameters / characteristic 

quantities, or combinations of at least two process 
parameters / characteristic quantities, which describe 

or define the respective process control, are used for 
monitoring the progression of the process.  

 
Procedure according to Claim 1, 2 or 8, characterized 
in that the measurement of the yarn tension (10, 10', 

10") is used as a process parameter at all production 
points (5, 5', ...) of the installation. 
Procedure according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the measurement of the bobbin contour (7) is used as a 

process parameter at the reference point (4). 
Procedure according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the measurement of the K-value, i.e., the ratio of the 

traversing frequency to the rotational speed of the 
bobbin, by means of appropriate measurement methods 

(8) is used as a process parameter at the reference 
point (4). 
Procedure according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the determination of the modulus of elasticity (9) is 

used as a process parameter at the reference point 
(4). 
Procedure according to one of Claims 8 to 12,

same type or the same combinations of different 
sensors are disposed simultaneously at different 

points of the thread run within a production point (4,

Procedure according to one of Claims 8 to 12, 
characterized in that the measurement of typical 

events from typical signal progressions (11) or 
combinations of typical signal progressions of the 

possible measurement signals by means of appropriate 
comparison methods is used as a process parameter at

Procedure according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in

 all, adjustment devices in the 
respective production process can be controlled by 

central predefinition of identical correcting 
quantities (12, 13, ...) at all production points (5,

in that documents for the documentation of the 

production quality are automatically assigned to each 
bobbin during the production process.
