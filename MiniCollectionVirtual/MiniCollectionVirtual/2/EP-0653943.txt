<DESCRIPTION>
 TARGETING SOMATIC GENE THERAPY TO JOINTSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the introduction of genetic material into the joints and cells comprising the joint structures for the purpose of somatic gene therapy. Further, it relates to methods for introducing novel genetic material into cells within the joint and achieving expression of gene products with therapeutic potential.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONSomatic gene therapy involves the treatment of genetic or acquired disease by the introduction of recombinant genes into somatic cells. Many different organs have been traditionally considered targets for somatic gene therapy including the bone marrow, liver, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and muscle. In general, somatic gene therapy has traditionally been considered for those organs and cells which can be studied in vitro or ex vivo. One of the reasons for this focus is that many schemes for somatic gene therapy involve the harvest of cells from an organ by surgical means, growing these cells in the laboratory, introducing genes into these cells using viral vectors, and then reimplanting these cells into the body using a cellular transplantation procedure. Broad applications of ex vivo schemes for gene therapy, particularly the transplantation of fibroblasts into many sites, have been proposed.More recently attention has turned to schemes for somatic gene therapy which involve in vivo delivery of recombinant genes to essential tissues by direct injection or targeted delivery. The present invention describes a novel approach to somatic gene therapy 

involving the direct delivery of recombinant genes to joint spaces and cells comprising essential structures of the joint for the purposes of treating various forms of arthritis or other diseases of the joints. Major joints may be targeted for somatic gene therapy by injection of genetic material into the joint space. This therapy would be intended to prevent the often crippling and painful manifestations of inflammatory or degenerative arthritis as well as to enhance the process of repair or regeneration after illness, injury, or surgery.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONAn object of the present invention is the transformation of cells comprising essential structures of the joint.An additional object of the present invention is a method of direct delivery of genetic material to the cells comprising essential structures of the joint.A further object of the present invention is the in vivo introduction of genetic material into
