<CLAIMS>
A device for sorting and storing objects, such as coins (12),
inserted by way of payment in a dispenser of products or a service,

comprising a coin input unit (10) connected to a selector (14)
adapted to sort said objects, the outlet of said selector (14) being

connected to a tray (56) and to holding means (16) for the same,
adapted to direct said objects either to said tray (56) or to final

storage means (55) for said objects or to a removable recycling
dispenser (22) adapted to store said objects temporarily and to

direct them either to said tray (56) or to said final storage means
(55), said recycling dispenser comprising at least two vertical tubes

(25-34), emptying means being adapted to direct the objects contained
in at least one tube (25-34) to said final storage means (55) and

which are actuated automatically at least as a preliminary to removal
of each tube, so as to prevent access to the interior of said tubes

when they are in position, the device being characterized in that it
includes means adapted to allow removal of only one tube at a time.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
holding means (16) includes a rotary barrel (17) in which the waiting

objects are adapted to be held while waiting, and in which said tubes
(25-34) are disposed in a circle centered on said barrel.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that said
holding means (16) also includes a plate (20) on which the barrel

(17) is fixed, said plate being adapted to be covered by a casing
(21) and said plate being located at the top of a cash container (22)

containing the recycling dispenser.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that it
includes means allowing the barrel (17) of the holding means (16) to

empty as a preliminary to removal and access to said barrel.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it includes routeing means at the outlet of the recycling

dispenser and comprising a hopper (50) provided at its bottom with an
aperture (51) opening into two channels (53, 54) connected 

respectively to the tray (56) and to the final storage means (55) a
flap (70) being adapted to block one of the channels alternately,

under the control of actuating means (700, 701), in such a manner
that the flap closes the access to the tray (56) when in its normal

position, the access channel (54) to the final storage means then
being open.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it includes means for discharging objects from the tubes (25-34)

one by one and comprising a slider (107).
A device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
each tube (25-34) can be moved radially between a first, blocked

position and a second position for removal, offset radially towards
the interior of the circle formed by the tubes (25-34), said means

adapted to allow removal of one tube at a time comprising a drum (95)
provided with an axial groove (96) of form complementary to said tube

to be removed and adapted to receive the latter at least partially.
A device according to claims 6 and 7, characterized in that it
includes a projecting part (106) on the slider (107) adapted to come

into abutment with a shoulder on the fixed base (37) relative to
which said tube is displaced.
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that it
includes an anti-picking device (130) for the tubes (25-34),

extending the base of the drum (95) towards the tray (56) in the
region of the groove (96).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it includes at least one sensor (90, 91) adapted to detect free

circulation of coins during operations returning change.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it includes at least one sensor (200) for checking that the tray

(56) is not blocked.
