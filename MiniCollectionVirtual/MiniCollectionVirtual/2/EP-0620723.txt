Film-forming cosmetic composition, characterized
in that it contains, in a suitable cosmetic vehicle, at

least one chlorinated graft copolymer resulting from the
grafting of 5 to 20 % of a chlorinated polyolefin with 80

to 95 % of acrylic, styrene and/or vinyl type unsaturated
monomers, it being possible for the monomers to be chosen

from oleophilic monomers, in a maximum proportion of 95%, and
hydrophilic monomers, in a maximum proportion of 40%.
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the chlorinated polyolefin has an

average molecular weight of between 8,000 and 140,000 and
a chlorine content of between 15 and 40 %.
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the monomers are of the oleophilic

type and are chosen from styrene and alkyl acrylates and
methacrylates.
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the unsaturated monomers are of the

hydrophilic type and are chosen from acrylic acid,
methacrylic acid and 2-hydroxyethyl or 2-hydroxypropyl

acrylates or methacrylates.
Cosmetic composition according to any one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the unsaturated

monomers take the form of a mixture consisting of
styrene, butyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid and

2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate.
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the chlorinated

graft copolymer is present at a concentration of between
0.01 and 80 %, and preferably between 0.5 and 30 %, by

weight relative to the total weight of the composition.
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it takes the form

of a cream, emulsion, gel, solution, milk, vesicular
dispersion based on ionic or nonionic amphiphilic lipid,

a setting lotion or an aerosol lacquer.
Composition according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it contains, in addition,

fats, organic solvents, silicones, thickeners, UV-A or
UV-B sunscreen agents, antifoams, hydrating agents,

humectants, perfumes, preservatives, surfactants, fillers,
sequestering agents, emulsifiers, anionic, nonionic

and amphoteric polymers or mixtures thereof, alkalinizing
agents, colorants, pigments, antioxidants, anti-free-radical

agents and any other active agent commonly used
in cosmetics.
Coloured or colourless nail varnish consisting of
a solvent system, a film-forming substance, a resin and

a plasticizing agent, characterized in that it contains
as main film-forming substance a chlorinated graft

copolymer resulting from the grafting of 5 to 20 % of a
chlorinated polyolefin with 80 to 95 % of acrylic,

styrene and/or vinyl type unsaturated monomers, it being
possible for the monomers to be chosen from oleophilic

monomers, taken separately or mixed in a proportion of
0 to 95 %, and hydrophilic monomers, also taken

separately or mixed in a proportion of 0 to 40 %.
Nail varnish according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the chlorinated graft copolymer is present in a

proportion of between 0.5 and 45 % by weight, and more
especially between 5 and 25 % by weight, relative to the

total weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to Claims 9 and 10,
characterized in that it contains nitrocellulose as

secondary film-forming substance.
Nail varnish according to any one of Claims 9 to 
11, characterized in that it contains a resin chosen from

arylsulphonamide/formaldehyde or arylsulphonamide/epoxy
type resins, an alkyde resin or an acrylic resin, in a

proportion of between 0.5 and 15 % by weight relative to
the total weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to any one of Claims 9 to
12, characterized in that the plasticizing agent is

present in a concentration of between 2 and 10 % by
weight relative to the total weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to any one of Claims 9 to
13, characterized in that it contains at least one

pigment of organic or inorganic nature in a proportion of
between 0.01 and 2 % by weight relative to the total

weight of the varnish.
Nail varnish according to any one of Claims 9 to
14, characterized in that it contains, in addition, at

least one UV screening agent, formaldehyde, a vitamin
such as vitamin E acetate or pantothenol, a strengthening

agent or an antimycotic agent.
