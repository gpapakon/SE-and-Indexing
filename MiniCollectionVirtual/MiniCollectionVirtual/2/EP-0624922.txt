<ABSTRACT>
When a retainer is displaced into a provisionally-retained 
position, a slanting abutment surface of a retaining step is 

abutted against a rear edge of a main portion of a metal 
terminal disposed in a half-inserted position. Then, when the 

retainer is pushed, each projection is guided by a slanting 
portion of a guide groove, so that the retainer is displaced 

obliquely forwardly downwardly, and reaches a completely-retained 
position. During this displacement, a forwardly-acting 

pressing force is exerted on the metal terminal, so that 
the metal terminal is automatically pushed deeper into a proper 

inserted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector having the function
of double retaining of metal terminals by a retainer,
and more particularly to a connector having the function of
urging half-inserted metal terminals into a proper inserted
position in accordance with the insertion of the retainer.There are known connectors having a double retaining
function to be performed by a retainer. In such a connector
as shown in Fig. 7, when a metal terminal c is inserted
into a terminal receiving hole b in a housing a from a rear
end thereof, an elastic retaining pawl d formed on an upper
wall of the terminal receiving hole b is elastically deformed
by this inserted metal terminal. Then, when the
metal terminal reaches a proper inserted position at the
inner end of the terminal receiving hole, the retaining
pawl d is received in a retaining recess e, formed in the
upper surface of the metal terminal c, due to its own resilient
restoring force, thereby effecting a first-stage
retaining in a withdrawing direction. Then, when a retainer
f, inserted into a provisionally-retained position from a
lower side of the housing a in a manner to generally divide
the housing, is pushed in a direction of an arrow to be retained
in a completely-retained position, a retaining step
formed on the retainer f is received in a recess h formed
in a lower surface of the metal terminal c, thereby effecting
a second-stage retaining.In such a connector, the metal terminal c is inserted
while elastically deforming the retaining pawl d, as described
above, and therefore a considerable load is perceived
halfway, and despite the fact that the metal terminal
has not yet reached the proper inserted position, the
inserting operation is often stopped under a mistake of
facts in a half-insertedposition as indicated in a broken
line in Fig. 7. If such a situation is encountered, even when the retainer
f is pushed, the retaining step g is abutted against
the lower surface of the metal terminal c, so that the retainer
can not be inserted. In this case, the operator becomes
aware of the half-inserted condition of the metal
terminal c, and it is necessary for the operator to once
retract the retainer f, to re-insert the metal terminal c
into the proper inserted position, and then to again push
the retainer f. However, since many metal terminals c have
been inserted, it is not easy to find the half-inserted
terminal among these terminals. And besides, such
half-inserted metal terminal is not always one, and in an
extreme case, all of the metal terminals must be

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising:

a connector housing (1) having terminal receiving
holes (3) each for receiving a metal terminal (11) inserted

from a rear end into the connector housing (1), and a retainer
insertion groove 
(6) which opens to one side of said connector
housing (1); and
a retainer (5) insertable into said retainer insertion
groove (6), said retainer (5) having communication holes

(9) communicatable with said terminal receiving holes (3),
respectively, and said retainer (5) being adapted to be retained

in a provisionally-retained position where each of
said communication holes (9) does not hinder the insertion

and withdrawal of said metal terminal (11) and in a completely-retained
position where said retainer (5) is engaged

with said metal terminals (11) in a manner to limit
the withdrawal of said metal terminals (11), wherein
guide grooves (19) for guiding the insertion of said
retainer (5) are formed on one of said connector housing

(1) and said retainer (5), whereas projections (26) for being
disposed to move respectively along said guide grooves

(19) are formed on the other;
said retainer (5) can be abutted against part of said
metal terminal (11) in said provisionally-retained position

when said metal terminal (11) is disposed in a
half-inserted position; and
each of said guide grooves (19) is so formed that during
the time when said retainer (5) is moved from said provisionally-retained

position to said completely-retained
position, said retainer (5) can push said metal terminals

(11) from the half-inserted position into a proper inserted
position,

   characterized in that 

said retainer insertion groove (6) is formed in said
connector housing (1) to divide each of said terminal receiving

holes (3) and each of said guide groves (19) for
guiding said projection (26) has an upper straight portion

(20) and a lower straight portion (21) which are parallel
to and offset relative to each other in front-to-rear direction,

wherein a slanting portion (22) communicates said
upper and lower straight portions (20, 21).
The connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
upper straight portion (20) and said lower straight portion

(21) are offset relative to each other in front-to-rear direction
in a manner that inner edges of the two straight

portions (20, 21) are aligned in a common straight line.
The connector as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
said connector housing (1) further comprises a pair of

guide walls (7) at opposite sides of said retainer insertion
groove (6).
The connector as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
retainer (5) has two leg portions to form fitting grooves

(10) downwardly opened to be fitted with said guide walls
(7).
The connector as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein
said guide grooves (19) are formed on said guide walls (7),

and said projections (26) are formed on said leg portions.
The connector as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to
5, wherein a width of said retainer (5) is less than a

width of said retainer insertion groove (6) by a predetermined
width.

of said projections (26) have a parallelogrammic shape with

a pair of sides which contact the edges of said straight 
portion (20, 21) of the guide groove (19), and the other

pair of sides contact with edges of said slanting portion
(22).
The connector as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to
7, wherein said guide groove (19) has an auxiliary groove

(23, 24) of greater depth running centrally with respect to
the width of the guide groove (19).
The connector as claimed in claim 8, wherein a further
projection (27) having a semi-spherical projection is

provided at said retainer (5) to be fit with said auxiliary
groove (23, 24).
