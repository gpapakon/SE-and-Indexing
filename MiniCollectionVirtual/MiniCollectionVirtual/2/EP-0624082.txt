<ABSTRACT>
A dressing core (1) in the form of a cylindrical tuft is surrounded by a sheath (2, 3) for supporting its mechanical structure. The sheath (2), which may consist of threads (2, 3), is permeable to the biological fluids of wounds and biocompatible therewith. The dressing is particularly suitable for deep wounds since it is readily removable therefrom.

Dressing product for a wound containing a biological 
liquid, comprising, in a substantially cylindrical form, a core 

(1) of fibres of metal alginate, characterised by the fact that 
the core (1) is surrounded by a retaining wrapper (2, 3; 4; 5; 7; 

9) whereof the structure is permeable to the biological liquid 
and biocompatible with the wound. 
Product according to Claim 1, in which the wrapper (2, 3; 
4; 5) is made up of filaments. 
Product according to Claim 2, in which the wrapper 
comprises a single thread (4). 
Product according to Claim 2, in which the wrapper 
comprises several threads (2, 3). 
Product according to Claim 1, in which the wrapper is 
constituted by a sheath (7; 9). 
Product according to Claim 5, in which the sheath (7) is 
perforated. 
Product according to Claim 5, in which the sheath (9) is 
porous. 
Product according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in which the 
wrapper is made of polymer. 
Product according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in which the 
fibres of the core (1) consist of an alginate of a metal chosen 

from the family of multivalent metals, with the exception of 
magnesium. 
Product according to Claim 9, in which the fibres consist 
of calcium alginate.
