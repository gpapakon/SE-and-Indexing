Device for conveying thick substances containing a great 
deal of solid material, with a conveying pipe (20) 

capable of being pressurized by the thick substances and 
at least one injection location (22, 24), discharging 

into the conveying pipe, for introducing a lubricant into 
the region (84) between the pipe wall and the surface of 

a length of thick substance (82) forming in the conveying 
pipe (20) and transported along it, characterized in that 

the conveying pipe (20) has at least one annular cross-sectional 
constriction (68, 70, 62', 79) disposed at a 

distance downstream from the injection location (22, 24). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
inside diameter (D₂) of the conveying pipe (20) in the 

region of the cross-sectional constriction (68, 70, 62', 
79) is at least 1 mm, and preferably 2 to 3 mm, smaller 

than that outside (D₁) this region. 
Device according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the cross-sectional constriction is 

formed by a bead-type or collar-type annular elevation 
(68, 70, 62', 79) located on the inside of the conveying 

pipe (20). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the cross-sectional constriction is 

formed by an annular weld bead (68) projecting into the 
interior of the pipe. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the cross-sectional constriction is 

formed by a collar ring (70), preferably clamped between 
two pipe connecting flanges (62), projecting into the 

interior of the pipe.  
 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the cross-sectional constriction is 

formed by a flange ring (62'), preferably welded on to a 
pipe section (20''), projecting into the interior of the 

pipe. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the cross-sectional constriction is 

located at the downstream end of a pipe bend (60). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a preferably closable hole (72) for 

the connection of an injection pipeline (76) for 
lubricant is located within the flow shadow of the cross-sectional 

constriction, passing essentially radially 
through the wall of the pipe. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in that at 
least one further cross-sectional constriction (79) is 

located at a distance downstream from the hole (72). 
Device according to either of Claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that in a horizontal or inclined 

conveying pipe (20) the hole (72) is located in the 
region of the underside of the pipe. 
Device according to any one of Claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in that there is a non-return valve (78) in 

the injection pipeline (76). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that there are several cross-sectional 

constrictions (68, 70, 62', 79) at intervals along the 
conveying pipe (20), preferably 2 to 6 m from each other. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized that at least two cross-sectional  

 
constrictions are disposed at a distance from each other 

close to the end (26) of the conveying pipe and that at 
least one drainage or extraction hole, passing through 

the wall of the pipe, is located within the region 
between these cross-sectional constrictions. 
Device according to any one of Claims 3 to 13, 
characterized in that the elevation forming the cross-sectional 

constriction has at least one hole passing 
through it in the direction of flow. 
Device according to any one of Claims 3 to 14, 
characterized in that the annular elevation is composed 

of wear-resistant material and is preferably replaceable.
