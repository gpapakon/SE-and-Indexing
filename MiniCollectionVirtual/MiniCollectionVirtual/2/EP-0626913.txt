<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel
chocking system for arresting road vehicles
transported on flatbeds or other similar transport
vehicles. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a device having a plurality of chock
members detachably secured to a grating provided on a
support surface of the vehicle at defined locations.
The chock comprises an angled face plate for
alignments with a tire of an associated wheel of the
vehicle positioned on the grating, restraining
movement thereof. A load transmitting member
transfers the load applied to the face plate onto the
grating and a paddle-shaped restraining member
prevents lateral shifting of the vehicle.Various anchoring systems are known for
securing road vehicles transported on flatbed type
transport vehicles to prevent shifting of those
vehicles during the transportation. The most common
system is to "tie down" the vehicle using chains
connected to steel runners in the support surface,
e.g., the floor of a railway flatbed vehicle. A
ratchet tool is required in order to secure these
chains taut. In an attempt to resolve some of the
difficulties in the installation of such anchoring
systems, other wheel chocking assemblies have been
developed including, e.g., those disclosed in U.S.
Patents 4,659,266 and 4,668,140. However, although 
these systems can be installed more rapidly onto a
rail system provided on the transport surface of
the flatbed, they utilize winch mechanisms and
harnesses which must be fitted over the vehicle
tires to restrain movement of the vehicle.French Patent No. FR-A-2 584 664 relates to
a wheel chocking system wherein the wheel of a
vehicle is restrained by an elevated rod which may
be angulated. Claim 1 is delimited over this FR-A 2 584 664.
The load of the vehicle is
transmitted to the floor by vertically extending
arms and this does not provide for effective load
transfer but causes a wedging action. German
Patent DE-A-1 265 771 shows a further chock design
where again effective load transfer from the tire
engaging plate to the floor is not effectively
provided.Other disadvantages of the wheel chocking
systems in the prior art is that they cannot be
readily adapted to different axle spacing to
double-wheel axles, or to very small or large
wheels openings in the vehicle side sheeting
project downwardly close to or below the level of
the top of the tire. Known chock systems can also
become jammed between the vehicle tire and the
floor due to vehicle shifting during transport
requiring movement of the vehicle prior to
