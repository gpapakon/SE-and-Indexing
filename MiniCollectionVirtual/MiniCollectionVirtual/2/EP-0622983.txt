<ABSTRACT>
A thermal attachment assembly for heat generating electronic devices which 
includes a multi-element spring having low force, high deflection, spring 

fingers, and which is adjustable and attached by screws to a cover to apply 
pressure directly against electronic components arranged generally perpendicular 

to at least one edge of a printed wired board (PWB). The attachment 
assembly includes a heat sink housing in which the electronic components 

are pressed against an electrically insulating, thermally conductive 
film positioned against one wall of the heat sink housing. The PWB is 

snapped to a carrier and both are placed into the housing so that the 
electronic devices are positioned within spaces of the carrier. The carrier 

includes sloping surfaces, so that the spring fingers are deflected downward 
when the cover is attached to the housing, thereby insuring that the 

spring fingers are properly positioned onto the electronic devices, between 
the spaces of the carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the attachment of printed circuit board mounted, 
heat generating electrical components to heat sinks. In particular, to the 
attachment to such electrical components which have heat transfer tabs to 
heat sink housings using spring type members. One method by which tabbed printed circuit board mounted, heat generating 
electrical components have been attached to heat sinks has involved individually 
attaching each device to the heat sink with a screw through the hole 
in the tab of the electronic device, and utilizing an electrically insulating 
thermally conductive film between the heat sink and the device 
tab. A nut is tightened onto the screw to provide the compressive force 
required to provide adequate compression of the film to maximize heat 
transfer from the device to the heat sink through the film. There are many 
variations of this technique, such as using a threaded hole in the heat 
sink rather than a nut. Problems arise with this general manner of attachment 
because the tension created by the screw may be relieved by material 
creep in the insulating washer or grommet, or the screw may back out under 
certain operating conditions, such as where the device is subject to 
vibration or temperature cycling. Another disadvantage is that the large 
number of parts that must be manually assembled when there are a number 
of heat generating components in an assembly, and it is difficult to 
automate the production of such attachments for high volume manufacturing. In addition to the various uses of attachment screws, numerous attachment 
techniques have been developed which use spring members. A number of these 
attachments use clips with multiple spring fingers, as can be seen by 
reference to U.S. Patents 4,922,601; 4,891,735; 4,872,089; 4,845,590; and 
4,707,726, for example. Difficulties are encountered with these techniques 
for various reasons. To achieve a compact assembly, the springs must 
achieve high forces at low deflections, and this means that the springs 
must be manufactured specifically for an individual device and changing 
the device may cause the spring to exert too much or too little force  
 
since stiff springs have force constants which create a very narrow range 
of deflections within which the proper pressure will be applied. Furthermore, 
there is often a need for special tools to insure that the device or 
the spring is not damaged during assembly. Historically, electrically insulating 
and thermally conductive pads require 2068,4 to 3447,4
