<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE ARTHROPODICAL I ROETHYLENES AND NITROGUANIDINES This invention pertains to methyl-substituted cyclic nitroethylenes and nitroguanidines as arthro- podicides, particularly for the control of planthoppers and leafhoppers.GB 1,483,633 generically discloses compounds of the present invention as insecticides. WO 91/17659 generically discloses a method to control planthoppers and leafhoppers with the compounds of the present invention. U.S. 4,880,933 generically discloses compounds of the present invention as intermediates for insecticides. There are no specific disclosures in these references to compounds of the present invention.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises compounds of Formula I, including all geometric and stereoisomers, agriculturally suitable salts thereof, agricultural compositions containing them and their use for the control of arthropods, particularly planthoppers and leafhoppers, in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments. The compounds of Formula I comprise:wherein:R1 is H, CH2CN, C1-C4 alkyl, 1.-C4 haloalkyl, formyl, C2-C alkylcarbonyl, C2-C3 alkoxy- carbonyl, C2-C4 alkoxyalkyl, C3-C6 dialkoxy- alkyl, C1-C3 alkoxy, C-^-C-^ alkylsulfonyl, C2-C4
 alkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C1-C4 alkylamino, C2-C4 dialkyla ino or benzyl optionally substituted with R2; R2 is halogen, ^-02 alkyl, C1-C2 haloalkyl, Cx-C2 alkoxy, Cx-C2 alkylthio, C1-C2 haloalkylthio,C1-C2 haloalkoxy, N0 or CN; and Z is CHN02 or NN02.Preferred Compounds A are compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is H, C1-C4 alkyl, formyl, CH3S(0)2 or CH3C(0) . Preferred Compounds B are Compounds A wherein Z is CHN02. Preferred Compounds C are Compounds A wherein Z is NN02.Specifically preferred for biological activity and ease of synthesis are the compounds of Preferred Compounds B and Preferred Compounds C respectively, which are:5-meth l-l-[2-(methylthio)ethyl]-2-(nitro- methylene)—i idazolidine; and 5-methyl-l-[2-(methylthio)ethyl] -N-nitro-2- imidazolidinimine.Preferred compositions of the present invention are those containing the above designated preferred compounds. Preferred methods for controlling foliar and soil inhabiting anthropods and nematode pests are those employing the above designated compounds and compositions.DETAILED DESCRIPTION QF THE INVENTION In the above definitions, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkythio" or "haloalkyl", denotes straight chain or branched alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or the di ferent butyl isomers. Alkoxy denotes methoxy, ethoxy,
