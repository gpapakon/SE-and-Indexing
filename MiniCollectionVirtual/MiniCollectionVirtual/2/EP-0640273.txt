A row marker (10) for an agricultural implement and which can be folded 
between an operating position and a rest position, with a wing arm (14) which can be 

pivoted on the implement, an inner arm (16) pivoted on the wing arm (14), an outer 
arm (17) pivoted on the inner arm (16), a double-acting hydraulic cylinder (40) which 

can be attached at its first end to the implement, a first crank lever (34) connected to 
the wing arm (14) and extending upwardly in the operating position of the row marker 

(10), a second crank lever (36), an inner control arm (48) with first and second ends, 
an outer control arm (70) with first and second ends and first and second control levers 

(58, 60), each having first and second ends and being pivoted at their second ends to 
the second end of the outer control arm (70), characterized in that the second crank 

lever (36) is fixed to the wing arm (14) and extends towards the ground in the 
operating position and in that a third crank lever (46) is fixed to the inner arm (16) and 

extends towards the ground in the operating position, wherein the second end of the 
hydraulic cylinder (40) is pivotally connected to the first crank lever (34), the first end 

of the inner control arm (48) is pivotally connected to the implement, the second end 
of the inner control arm (48) is pivotally connected to the third crank lever (46), the 

first end of the outer control arm (70) is pivotally connected to the second crank lever 
(36), the first end of the first control lever (58) is pivotally connected to the inner arm 

(16) and the first end of the second control lever (60) is pivotally connected to the 
outer arm (17). 
A row marker according to claim 1, characterized in that the first end of the 
inner control arm (48) can move in a slot (52) provided on the implement. 
A row marker according to claim 2, characterized in that the hydraulic cylinder 
(40) can be connected to the implement through a link bar (42). 
A row marker according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the ends of the inner and outer arms (16, 17) which are pivotally connected 

together are each provided with a stop (80), which stops bear on one another in the  
 

operating position and prevent the outer arm (17) folding upwardly in the operating 
position. 
A row marker according to claim 4, characterized in that the wing arm (14) is 
provided with a stop (86) which bears against the third crank lever (46) in the 

operating position and prevents the inner arm (16) folding upwardly in the operating 
position. 
A row marker according to claim 2 and 3, wherein the wing arm (14) can be 
attached to the implement by an attachment device (24), characterized in that the 

attachment device (24) is provided with a vertically upstanding plate (96) having the slot 
(52), wherein the link bar (42) is pivoted on to the attachment device (24) and is 

adjustable against the action of a spring (43).
