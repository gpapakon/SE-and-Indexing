<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for detecting objects or edges of objects, in particular edges which are constructed on or in the objects in the form of end faces or sectional faces, which lie in a specific angular region with reference to a predetermined main surface of the objects, by means of light reflected from the objects, a light beam (E) from a light source (L) irradiating the object (S), in a specific range ( delta ) of angles of incidence, on to a respective end face or sectional face (K1, K2, K3), a relative movement being effected between light source (L) and the objects (S) or the edges (K1, K2, K3) respectively, a proportion (AI) of the incident light (E) reflected therefrom being detected by a light detector (R) arranged in a range of angles of reflection, and a signal (U) indicating the presence of the object (S) and/or one or more end face(s) or sectional face(s) (K1, K2, K3) being produced.
