<ABSTRACT>
An undergarment according to the invention comprises 
basic cloth (1) having an elastic stretchability,at least in 

width , and an absorbent pad (10) having an elastic 
stretchability, at least in width, and bonded to the inner 

surface of the basic cloth. During use, the basic cloth (1) 
adapts itself to movement of the wearer and the absorbent pad 

(10) elastically adapts to elastic movements of the basic 
cloth, thereby avoiding collapse of the absorbent pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
undergarment of the pants type formed by bonding front and rear 
bodies along respective opposite side edges at a waist 
level such as incontinence diapers, baby diapers, baby 
training pants and sanitary pants. Such an undergarment of the prior art usually employs 
elastically stretchable nonwoven fabric at least partially 
as top- and backsheets and a liquid-absorbent core mainly 
consisting of fluffy pulp to be sandwiched between the top- 
and backsheets. However, the elastic stretchability of said top- and 
backsheets as a whole is limited by the liquid-absorbent core 
because said liquid-absorbent core is substantially non-stretchable 
and the liquid-absorbent core is sometimes 
collapsed or partially broken due to the elastic behavior of 
the top- and backsheets. The collapse of the liquid-absorbent 
core will give the wearer an uncomfortable feeling 
or will significantly reduce its absorptivity for liquid 
excretion. It is an object of the invention to eliminate the above-mentioned  
 
problems by providing the liquid-absorbent core 
with an elastic stretchability. The object set forth above is achieved, according to the 
invention, by a disposable undergarment comprising a basic 
cloth made of fibrous nonwoven fabric elastically stretchable 
at least in length and width and provided with a waist-opening 
and a pair of leg-openings, wherein said undergarment 
further comprises an absorbent pad .having an elastic 
stretchability at least in width and intermittently bonded to 
the inner surface of said undergarment. Preferably, said absorbent pad comprises top- and 
backsheets both having an elastic stretchability at least in 
width and a liquid-absorbent core having an elastic 
stretchability at least in width, said core being sandwiched 
between said top- and backsheets and made at least of 
synthetic fibre having an elastic stretchability. Preferably, said absorbent pad comprises top- and 
backsheets both having an elastic stretchability at least in 
width and an integrally molded liquid-absorbent core which is 
substantially non-stretchable and sandwiched between said 
top- and backsheets so that said top- and backsheets may be  
 
elastically stretchable at least in width with respect to 
said core. The basic cloth elastically adapts itself to movement of 
the wearer during use and the absorbent pad also elastically 
adapts to such elastic movement of the basic cloth. The invention will be described by way of example with 
reference to the
