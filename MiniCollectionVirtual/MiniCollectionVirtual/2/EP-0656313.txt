<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus and 
a procedure for mounting a bearing wheel 

journal box (6) in a supporting structure. 
The supporting structure consists 

of a supporter side plate (4) having a 
seating (21) for the journal box (6). The 

seating has an opening delimited by 
corners (23,25). On the periphery of the 

journal box (6) there is an area (12) of 
reduced thickness, in the region of which 

the outer measure (S) of the journal box 
is smaller than the distance (W) between 

the corners (23,25) of the seating (21), 
while at other points the outer measure 

(D) of the journal box is larger than 
said distance (W). The journal box (6) is 

inserted into the seating (21) by holding 
the reduced-thickness portion (12) 

against the edge (23) of the opening and 
then turned into a desired position in 

the seating (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for mounting a 
journal box as defined in the preamble of claim 1, and to a 
procedure for mounting a journal box according to claim 7. The bearing wheel of a crane is mounted with a bearing in a 
supporter which, in the working position, rests on the bearing 
wheel. During installation and possibly during transport, 
the bearing and the bearing wheel must be properly 
mounted in the end plate of the supporter. In previously known solutions, the bearing wheel is mounted 
in the supporter by using a mounting collar fitted around 
the journal box and attached to the supporter. A solution 
like this requires extra parts and extra work during 
installation. The object of the invention is to achieve a new procedure 
and a new arrangement for mounting the bearing wheel during 
installation and transport which does not require specific 
tools, means or operations during installation. To achieve 
this, the apparatus of the invention is characterized by the 
features presented in the characterization part of claim 1. 
Correspondingly, the procedure of the invention for the 
mounting of a journal box is characterized by the features 
presented in the characterization part of claim 5. Other 
embodiments of the invention are defined in the subclaims. In the solution of the invention, the bearing wheel is 
mounted between the bearing surfaces of the supporter by 
means of its journal box without separate supporting parts. 
The bearing wheel can be mounted in position quickly and in 
a simple manner. Eccentric journal boxes used with the 
bearing wheel are easy to turn and adjust even on site when 
the bearing wheel has been lifted up and is reliably supported 
by the supporting structures during adjustment.  In the following, the invention is described by the aid of 
an embodiment by referring to the drawings, in which 
Fig. 1 presents the supporting structure as seen from the 
end of the bearing wheel shaft. Fig. 2 presents a cross-section of the supporting 
structure, and Fig. 3 presents the supporting structure of Fig. 1 with 
the journal box in the position in which it is inserted. Fig. 1 presents a bearing wheel 2 of a crane and its supporting 
structure as seen from the direction of the shaft 3, 
and Fig. 2 presents a cross-section of the bearing wheel 
along a plane passing through the shaft of the bearing 
wheel. The side plates, i.e. the end plates 4, of the crane 
supporter rest on the shaft 3 of the bearing wheel 2, the 
forces being transmitted by the bearing

Apparatus for mounting the journal box (6) of a bearing 
wheel in a supporting structure consisting of at least a 

side plate (4), a seating (21) in the side plate whose curb 
constitutes a bearing surface for the journal box (6) and a 

gap delimited by corners (23,25) on the curb of the seating, 
through which gap the journal box (6) can be fitted into the 

seating (21), characterized in that the periphery of the 
journal box (6) has at least one portion (12) of reduced 

thickness in the area of which the outer measure (S) of the 
journal box is smaller than the distance (W) between the 

corners (23,25) of the seating (21) and that the outer measure 
(D) of the journal box (6) in other areas is larger than 

the distance (W) between the corners (23,25) of the seating. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
curb forming the bearing surface of the seating (21) has 

substantially the shape of a circular arc and that the arc 
between the corners on the curb is over 180 degrees. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the surface of the journal box (6) in the reduced-thickness 

area (12) is a planar surface formed by machining 
a segment off the periphery of the journal box (6). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 - 3, characterized 
in that the periphery of the journal box (6) has two 

areas of reduced thickness, placed essentially on opposite 
sides of the periphery of the journal box (6). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 - 4, characterized 
in that a journal box (6) is provided on both 
sides 
in the axial direction of the bearing wheel (2), which 

journal boxes can be turned independently of each other. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 - 5, characterized 
in that the journal boxes (6) on both sides in the 

 
axial direction of the bearing wheel (2) are of identical 

design. 
Procedure for mounting a bearing wheel (2) and a journal 
box (6) attached to it to a supporting structure consisting 

of a side plate (4) and in the side plate a seating (21) for 
a journal box (6), in which procedure a gap delimited by a 

first (23) and a second corner (25) is formed on the curb of 
the seating (21), through which gap the journal box (6) is 

fitted into the seating (21), characterized in that an area 
of reduced thickness reducing the outer measure of the journal 

box (6) is formed on the periphery of the journal box 
(6), that the gap (W) of the seating (21) is made larger than 

the diameter (S) of the journal box (6) at the reduced-thickness 
area and smaller than the journal box diameter (D) 

in areas outside the reduced-thickness area, and that the 
journal box (6) is inserted into the seating (21) by holding 

the reduced-thickness area of the journal box opposite a 
corner of the seating, whereupon the journal box (6) is 

turned in the seating (21) to a position in which the 
reduced-thickness area of the journal box does not lie 

opposite the corner (23,25) of the seating. 
Procedure according to claim 7, characterized in that 
there is a journal box (6) and a corresponding supporting 

structure with a seating (21) on both sides of the bearing 
wheel (2) in its axial direction, which journal boxes are 

turned independently of each other. 
Procedure according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the reduced-thickness areas (12) on the journal box (6)
