<ABSTRACT>
A device for recording and/or reproducing or transmitting and/or 
receiving compressed data includes decoding circuits (31 to 33) for 

performing expansion during the compression process. An error produced 
during the compression process is calculated by an input/output error 

calculating circuit (41) from the input data and data compressed by 
adaptive bit allocation encoding circuits (22 to 24) and expanded by 

the decoding circuits (31 to 33), and bit allocation is again 
calculated on the basis of the error produced during the compression 

process, with the input data remaining as it is. The bit allocation 
re-calculated in this manner is quantized by the encoding circuits (22 

to 24). Also, data annulling the error produced during the compression 
process is formulated by the input/output error calculating circuit 

(41) and summed to the input signals for subsequent quantization. 

Compressed signals suited to the input signals may be obtained even if 
the model for the auditory sense or constants occasionally employed are 

not suited to the input signals, or if the input signals are 
unanticipated signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for recording and/or 
reproducing or transmitting and/or receiving compressed data, for 
example bit-compressed digital audio signals or the like. Our US Patents Nos. US-A-5 243 588 and US-A-5 244 705 disclose a 
technique consisting in bit-compressing input digital audio signals and 
recording the bit-compressed signals in a burst fashion with a pre-set 
data volume as a recording unit. This technique resides in employing a magneto-optical disc as a 
recording medium and recording and/or reproducing AD (adaptive 
differential) PCM audio data as prescribed in audio data formats such 
as CD-I (CD-Interactive) or CD-ROM XA. The AD-PCM audio data is 
recorded in a burst fashion on the magneto-optical disc with e.g. 32 
sectors of the AD-PCM data and, for interleaving, a few linking sectors 
as one recording unit. Several modes of the AD-PCM audio data may be selected in the 
recording and/or reproducing device employing the magneto-optical disc. 
For example, a level A with a compression ratio twice that of the 
conventional compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz, a 
level B with a compression ratio four times of that of the conventional 
compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 37.8 kHz and a level C 
with a compression ratio eight times of that of the conventional 
compact disc (CD) and a sampling frequency of 18.9 kHz, are prescribed. 
That is, with the above-mentioned level B, the digital audio data is 
compressed to approximately one fourth of the original volume, with the 
replay time of the disc recorded with the level B mode being four times 
that with the standard CD format. This indicates that a  
 
recording/reproducing time about as long as that achieved with a 
standard size disc of 12 cm in diameter may be achieved with a smaller 
sized disc and hence the device may be reduced in size. However, since the rotational speed of the disc is the same as 
that of a standard CD, the amount of the compressed data obtained with 
the level B per pre-set time is four times that of the standard CD. 
Consequently, the same compressed data is read in superimposition four 
times, in a time unit of e.g. a sector or a cluster, and only one of 
the four superimposed compressed data is transmitted for audio 
reproduction. Specifically, during scanning or tracking of a spiral 
recording track, a track jump of returning to the starting track 
position is performed for each disc revolution for repeatedly tracking 
the same track four times on end by way of
