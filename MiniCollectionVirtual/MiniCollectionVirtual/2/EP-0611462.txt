<ABSTRACT>
A memory management system for a computer system controls multiple resources (80, 82, 84, 86, 88) which may be used to transfer data values between a central processing unit (56, 58), a cache memory (2) and a main memory (60). The central processing unit and the main memory generate requests for these resources which are prioritized with internal pending requests (70, 72, 74) held by the memory management system. The memory management system allocates the resources among the pending requests so that multiple requests can be processed concurrently. The cache memory (2) is organized in multiple partitions which may be written to concurrently and read from concurrently. The memory management system allocates the reading and writing of each partition of the cache memory as a separate resource.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to memory
management apparatus for use in a digital data
processor and particularly to techniques for improving
the efficiency of a memory system including the
retrieval and storage of data in a cache memory.A memory management system controls the
access of multiple requestors in a digital data
processing system to data and program code in a main
memory. In many computer systems, all memory access
requests which either fetch or store data are made
through a cache memory. A cache memory is a memory
that is packaged as an integral component of a
processing unit in the computer system. The cache is
much smaller than main memory. Its purpose is to
emulate the main memory, but with a much faster access 
time. Since a cache is smaller than main memory, it
can only contain a subset of the contents of the main
memory at any one time. A directory is used in a cache
to identify which parts of the main memory are resident
in the cache.The prior art contains many techniques which
improve the ability of cache memory systems to furnish
data to and receive data from the central processing
unit. U.S. Patent 4,208,716 to Porter, et al.
discusses a cache which is partitioned into multiple
levels. While a write request is being performed on
one level of the cache, one or more read operations
from other cache levels may be performedU.S. Patent 4,905,141 to Brenza discusses the
use of a cache which is divided into partitions, where
a plurality of processors may each access any of the
partitions. Each processor has a partition look-aside
table (PLAT) which performs address translation,
identifying the partitions and congruence class
identifiers of the cache entries most recently
referenced by that processor. The cache is capable of
performing one store or fetch operation per partition
per clock cycle for data which are in the PLAT. Only a
subset of the data in cache are listed in the PLAT. If
a reference is made to a data value which is not in the
PLAT, a global request is issued to all of the
partitions. This global request requires all cache
partitions for one clock cycle.U.S. Patent 4,794,521 to Ziegler, et al.
discusses a cache capable of concurrently working on
the completion of multiple cache accesses. The cache
is divided into sections. Each section can handle one
access per clock. If the access causes a cache miss,
then the cache has the ability to put the first access
in a pending-access-completion state while the memory 
access occurs, and of accepting another cache access.

Apparatus for managing concurrent access to data values in a cache
memory (2) wherein said data values have a corresponding address value,

said cache memory (2) being arranged into a plurality of cache memory
