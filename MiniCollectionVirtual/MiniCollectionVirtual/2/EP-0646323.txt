<ABSTRACT>
A fat simulating composition is composed of a substantial 
portion of elongated, irregularly shaped carbohydrate gel 

particles having a longest axial dimension of up to 250 
microns with a mean volume diameter ranging from about 10 

microns to about 100 microns; the particles are in a hydrated 
state so as to have the substantially smooth organoleptic 

character of an oil emulsion. This fat simulating product is 
substituted in foods for all or a portion of the fat and/or 

oil used in that food product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to edible fat substitutes which
include shredded carbohydrate gel particles.Prior to the present invention, it was believed that in
order to simulate a fat sensation in the mouth, that
carbohydrate particles had to be substantially spheroidal in
shape and had to have a mean diameter particle size
distribution between about 0.1 micron and about 2 microns (µ)
with less than about 2% of the number of particles exceeding
3µ. The particles also had to be non-aggregated. If the
carbohydrate particles meet these criteria, U.S. 4,911,946
teaches that they will exhibit the substantially smooth
organoleptic character of an oil-in-water emulsion and could
be used to replace all or a portion of the fat or cream in
food products such as ice cream, yogurt, salad dressings,
mayonnaise, cream, cream cheese, other cheeses, sour cream,
sauces, icings, whipped toppings, frozen confections, milk, 
coffee whiteners, and spreads. PCT publication no. WO
89/12403 also discloses that a fat-like mouthfeel can result
from carbohydrate particles having a substantially spheroidal
shape with a mean diameter distribution in the range of from
about 0.1 to about 4 microns, with less than about 2% of the
total number of particles larger than about 5µ. However, this
publication demonstrated, in Example 5, the criticality of the
particle sizes in an alginate product by showing that the
product was found to provide some powdery character upon
swallowing as a consequence of the larger particle volume
weighted mean equivalent diameter for alginate of Example 5
verses that for konjak in Example 3. Further, this
publication demonstrates the need for specialized equipment
(i.e., US Patent No 4,828,396), or specialized separation to
obtain the correct particle range (i.e., sieving and
centrifugation), or multiple passes through a very high
pressure homogenizer (ten times at greater than or equal to
9,000 psig). (It is known that 1 psig = 6.895 KPa guage
pressure). Also, this prior art demonstrates an overall low
yield (i.e., 10% yield in Example 3).A need exists in the food industry for an improved fat
simulating substance for which strict size and shape control
of the particles is not required. Hence, the present
invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by
providing a fat-simulating composition which does not rely on
strict particle size and shape control, or specialized
equipment or processes, while being readily producible in a
high yield. This invention is directed to a fat simulating
composition
