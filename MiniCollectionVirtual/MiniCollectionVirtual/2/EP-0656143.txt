<ABSTRACT>
Azimuth error between a write head (16) and a read head (34) is determined by passing a multi-track tape (2) past the write head (16) and subsequently the read head (34). The signals written by the write head (16) and read by the read head (34) are analysed to determine the timing error (38) between best-match time-delayed portions (20-28) of these signals. This timing error (38) is indicative of the azimuth error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the determination of azimuth error between
write and read heads and has particular, although not exclusive, relevance to such
determination as may be utilised in audio cassette recording and playback.It is known that azimuth accuracy is a fundamental feature of good audio
cassette duplication. By azimuth is meant the angle between the gap of the read head
relative to the direction of movement of the tape and also the gap of the write head
relative to the direction of movement of the tape. The write head having supplied
information to the tape. If these two angles are both zero, the azimuths are zero and
optimum high-frequency performance may be achieved. Should either azimuth deviate
from zero, then deterioration in this high-frequency range may result. Conventionally azimuth accuracy is achieved by maintaining the write head gap,
during recording, at exactly 90Â° to the direction of tape movement and also maintaining
the read head at the same angle during playback. US Patent number 4,709,288 discloses
such a mechanism. A fine adjustment mechanism, such as a micrometer screw is
provided by which either the cassette tape guide elements or the write or read head itself
may be partially rotated or pivoted in order to maintain the head normal to the direction of
the tape travel.The above system, whilst adequate, suffers from the shortcomings that in order for
accurate micrometer calibration to be achieved, a test tape must be used. This tape bears a
recording of a sine wave at a frequency towards the upper end of the bandwidth over
which the machine is to operate. The micrometer screw is then adjusted until the
maximum signal output level is achieved.It will be appreciated that to use such a test tape prior to each playback is, at best,
a nuisance in, for example, mass reproduction situations.It is, therefore, an attractive proposition to have a system for the measurement of
azimuth error which does not necessarily require the use of a test tape.
JP-A-5677925 discloses a head angle control device comprising means for comparing
the output of two heads and means for carry out an angle control of one of the heads.A method of measuring azimuth error using timers triggered by marker transitions
recorded in a pair of tracks of a multitrack tape is disclosed in the Journal of the Society of
Motion Picture and Television Engineers, vol 94, no 11, p 1180-1184.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of measurement of the
azimuth error by utilising the signals
