<ABSTRACT>
A self-indexing exit gate (18) for a side-by-side 
milking parlor (10) has a yoke member (34) that is cantilevered on 

a sleeve (27) that is journaled on an overhead rotary pivot 
bar (19). A latch member (29) affords a limited amount of play 

between the sleeve member (27) and the pivot bar (19). A pneumatic 
cylinder (20) rotates the pivot bar (10) between the first and 

second positions, which correspond to lowered and raised 
positions of the exit gate yoke member (34). The yoke member (34) 

has a center of gravity positioned somewhat distally of 
the rotary shaft (19), which provides a small amount of play, 

that is, about six inches, at the point of contact with 
the shoulders of the cow (12). The latch member (29) permits 

individual release of a cow from her stall without 
affecting the exit gates of the other stalls (16) in the dairy 

parlor (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the 
field of cattle stalls, and in particular to milking 
parlors and milking stalls designed for compactness, 
efficient parlor operation, and maximum comfort for the 
cows. The milking parlor generally consists of an array 
of individual stalls, each designed to hold a cow or other 
dairy animal while she is being milked. An attendant or 
operator is usually required to be present at the parlor 
to perform such tasks as ensuring that the animals are 
properly situated in the stalls; washing the udders prior 
to milking; applying milker units; and monitoring and 
attending to the operation of the milking units. The 
attendant also ensures that the cows to be milked enter 
the dairy parlor through an entrance gate, and that they 
exit the dairy parlor through an exit gate when the 
milking is completed. A recent development of parlor design is the so 
called side-by-side or parallel stall configuration. 
Here, the cow is positioned facing outwardly from the 
operator and milking takes place at the rear of the cow, 
that is, between the hind legs. Variations of this design 
include a V-shaped parlor arrangement and a curved parlor 
arrangement, the later being discussed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,000,119, having the same assignee as this matter. These side-by-side parlors are designed so that 
cows enter through an entry gate into an aisle or pathway 
along the rear side of the parlor, and then turn 
approximately 90 degrees and enter the furthest stall that 
is not yet occupied by a cow. A scheme of sequencing 
gates can be employed to ensure that the cows proceed to 
the proper stall. The milking parlor generally has a rear wall that 
defines one side of the entry aisle, dividers that serve 
as side walls, and an exit gate at the front of each 
stall. The rear wall, which can contain a kick bar and a 
manure shield, for example, defines the milker position.  
 
The cow's hind legs are to be positioned against this 
wall. The front or exit gate can be of a sideways 
swinging or race gate design, with doors that swing open 
to release the cow, or can be of an upward swinging or 
yoke-type design, which moves upward or above the cow to 
release her from the stall. The sequencing gate can form 
a part of the side wall that separates the cows from one 
another. The cow stalls have a predetermined length, i.e., 
between the rear wall and the front gate when the same is 
in its lowered or closed position. However, the cows are 
not all of the same predetermined length
