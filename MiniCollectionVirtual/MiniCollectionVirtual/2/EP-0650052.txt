Method for determining heat quantities produced by an aerobic biological process in 
which a substrate undergoing aerobic decomposition is exposed to a surrounding or 

penetrating flow of air, in which method the biologically formed quantity of water is 
determined from the moisture content of the exhaust air, with the moisture contained in 

the exhaust air being separated out by condensation, and in which method the thermal 
energy is determined from the quantity of biologically formed water in accordance with 

the following formula: 

Q = H = r x m
K
 + m
K
 x c x t 
 
where 


Q = Heat of evaporation 
H = Biologically generated heat 
r = Heat of evaporation 
m
K
 = Mass of the condensate 
c = Specific heat 
t = Temperature 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the change in the state of the air from 
entry in the substrate to exit from the substrate is determined by measurement. 
Method for determining the rate of aerobic microbiological decomposition in a process in 
which a substrate undergoing aerobic decomposition is exposed to a surrounding or 

penetrating flow of air,
 
characterized in that
  
 

the rate of microbiological decomposition is determined from the thermal energy 
generated by the aerobic biological process, with the relevant heat quantities being 

determined in accordance with the method according to Claim 1 or 2. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that the exhaust air is cooled so that its 
water content on entry into the atmosphere is identical to its water content prior to entry in 

the substrate.
