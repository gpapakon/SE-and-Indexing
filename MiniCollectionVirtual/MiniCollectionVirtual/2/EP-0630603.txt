<ABSTRACT>
A signalling device for communicating reaching of a 
minimum water level in a tank (2) comprises a flexible 

receptacle (5) partly filled with a working fluid and 
having one work portion (6) located under the tank and 

subjected to the weight of the water contained in said 
tank, as well as a second work portion (8), projecting 

sideways from the tank (2), which is subjected to 
expansion following transferring of the working fluid by 

effect of the water weight, in order to switch over a 
microswitch (4) between a first operating condition and 

a second operating condition, respectively corresponding 
to an amount of water larger and smaller than a 

predetermined safety water level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signalling device for
communicating reaching of a predetermined liquid level
in feed tanks, in particular for electrically working
apparatus, comprising: a supporting housing; a tank
located in the supporting housing; a microswitch
operatively connected to an electric control circuit;
transducer means operating between the tank and the
microswitch for triggering operation of the microswitch
when the amount of liquid in the tank overcomes a
predetermined safety limit.A device having the features of the preamble of claim 1 is
described for example in GB-A-2140286.In the embodiment hereinafter described, the device in
reference is especially envisaged for use on small
household appliances. Obviously the innovatory concepts
proposed in the present invention can be used in
apparatus different from those particularly referred to
in the following description.It is known that in feed tanks usually associated with
household electrical appliances, such as for example
coffee making machines and other machines for producing
hot beverages, steam producing and dispensing machines
and still other machines, particular expedients are
normally required for immediately identifying when a
predetermined level (usually the minimum level) has
been reached in the tank by the water or any other
liquid contained therein.In the connection, in many embodiments the tank is
provided to be made of a transparent material and to be
located in the household appliance in such a manner that
the level of the water contained therein may be easily
seen from the outside. In the embodiment of the above type however, the fact
that the tank is to be arranged at a location where it
is partially visible involves undesired restrictions to
the design of the whole appliance.In addition and above all, the solutions of the above
type are not capable of informing the user immediately
and in an efficient manner that the minimum water level
has been reached and are not at all capable of
activating, if required, safety devices capable of
cutting off the current supply to the appliance when the
amount of water in the tank is under said minimum level.
Therefore, it may often happen that the user does not
pay due attention to the water level in the tank and
keeps the appliance working even in the complete absence
of water. In the frequent cases in which electric
resistors are to be activated for water heating, this
situation causes the resistors to be maintained at a
high temperature in spite of the continuous control
carried

<CLAIMS>
A signalling device for communicating reaching of a
predetermined liquid level in feed tanks, in particular

for electrically working apparatus, comprising:

a supporting housing (3);
a tank (2) located in the supporting housing (3);
a microswitch (4) operatively connected to an electric
control circuit;
transducer means (5) operating between the tank (2)
and the microswitch (4) for triggering operation of the

microswitch when the amount of liquid in the tank (2)
overcomes a predetermined safety limit,

characterized in that said transducer means comprises a
flexible receptacle (5) hermetically closed and

partially filled with a working fluid, which receptacle
has one work portion (6) operatively interposed between

said tank (2) and a first locating surface (7) formed in
the supporting housing (3), and a second work portion

(8) projecting sideways from the tank (2) and
operatively interposed between a second locating surface

(9) formed in the supporting housing (3) and said
microswitch (4),

said tank (2) being engaged in the supporting housing
(3) in such a manner that it can slide in a vertical

direction for transmitting the weight of the liquid
contained therein to the first work portion (6) of the

flexible receptacle (5), so that said microswitch (5),
following an expansion carried out by the second work

portion (8), is selectively switched over between a
first operating condition to which an amount of liquid

greater than the safety liquid level corresponds, and a
second operating condition to which an amount of liquid

lower than said safety liquid level corresponds.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that it further comprises preloading

means (4a, 10a) acting on the second work portion (8) of 
the flexible receptacle (5) for resisting switching over

of the microswitch (4) from the second to the first
operating condition.
A signalling device according to claim 2,
characterized in that said preloading means comprises an

actuation element (4a) associated with said microswitch
(4) and acting an the second work portion (8) with a

predetermined preloading force when the microswitch (4)
is switched over to the first operating condition.
A signalling device according to claim 2,
characterized in that said preloading means comprises at

least one spring (10a) operatively interposed between
the microswitch (4) and the second work portion (8).
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that it further comprises at least one

transducer plate (10) operatively interposed between the
second work portion (8) and said microswitch (4) and

acting on the second work portion itself over a
predetermined contact surface.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that the working fluid contained in the

flexible receptacle (5) is a liquid.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that the working fluid contained in the

flexible receptacle (5) is a gaseous fluid.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that said flexible receptacle (5) is

filled with said working fluid substantially until half
its maximum capacity.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that said flexible receptacle (5) 

comprises a tubular element made of plastic material and
heat sealed at its ends.
A signalling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that said first and
 second work
