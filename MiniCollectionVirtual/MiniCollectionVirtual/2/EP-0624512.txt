<ABSTRACT>
A means of transport, in particular a two-wheeler, is 
provided with a frame supported by running wheels, with an 

electromotor, by means of which at least one of the running 
wheels (1) can be rotated, and with at least one battery (18,19) provided 

on the frame for supplying energy to the electromotor, 
characterized in that the battery is disposed near the wheel 

hub (2) of one of the wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a means of transport, in 
particular a two-weeler, provided with a frame supported by running 
wheels, with an electromotor, by means of which at least one of said 
running wheels can be rotated, and with at least one battery provided 
on the frame for supplying energy to said electromotor, wherein said 
battery or batteries is/are disposed close to the wheel hub of one of 
the wheels and are supported by a support fixed to one of the tubes 
forming a fork of the means of transport. With respect to such a means of transport (DE-A-4000960), 
in particular a bicycle equipped with an auxiliary motor in the shape 
of an electromotor, it has been proposed to mount the required battery 
(batteries) on a disc-shaped plate extending perpendicular to the axis 
of rotation of the running wheel, whereby said plate has been fixed to 
a fork of the bicycle at some distance above the shaft of the running 
wheel. According to the invention the support is of U-shaped 
section and the hub of the wheel supported by said fork extends 
between the legs of said U-shaped support. By using the construction according to the invention the 
battery or batteries can be incorporated in the wheel of the means of 
transport in an advantageous manner, so that the  
 
battery or batteries do(es) not form an impeding attachment to 
the means of transport, whilst at the same time the position of 
the battery or batteries do(es) not have an adverse effect on 
the position of the centre of gravity of the means of 
transport. The invention will be explained in more detail 
hereafter with reference to the accompanying Figures. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a rear wheel of a 
means of transport with two batteries, wherein the various 
parts are shown some distance apart. Figure 2 is a perspective view of parts of the wheel of 
the means of transport, which are shown some distance apart. As is shown in Figures 1 and 2 the wheel 1 of a means 
of transport,in particular a two-wheeler such as for example 
described in the applicant's prior Dutch Patent Application No. 
9300321, comprises a dome-shaped disc 2, to whose 
circumference a rim 3 is secured. A pneumatic tyre 4 is fitted 
on the rim 3 in a usual manner. A hub 6 is mounted in the centre of the dome-shaped 
disc 2 by means of a supporting plate 5. Furthermore one or 
more chain wheels are secured to said supporting plate 5. A second dome-shaped disc 8 may be fixed to the wheel 
1, near the inner circumference of the rim 3, in such a manner 
that a space is

that a central space (2, 8) for accommodating the battery or batteries 

(18, 19) is formed in the wheel (1), which space can be closed by 
means of a cover (16) located at one side of the wheel (1). 
A means of transport according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a dome-shaped disc (2) abuts a hub (6) of the 

wheel (1), by means of which said hub (6) is connected to a rim (3) of 
the wheel (1). 
A means of transport according to claim 3, characterised in 
that said disc (2) abuts the rim with its outer circumference. 
A means of transport according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the outer circumference of said disc (2) 

is connected to the rim (3) by spoke-shaped means.  
 
A means of transport according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the wh
eel (1) comprises two opposite 
dome-shaped discs (2, 8), between which the battery or batteries (18, 

19) is/are disposed. 
A means of transport according to claim 6, characterised in 
that an opening (9), which can be closed, is provided in the centre of 

one of said dome-shaped discs (8). 
A means of transport according to claim 7, characterised in 
that near the boundary edge of said opening (9) an annular strip (10)
