<ABSTRACT>
An audio signal reproducing apparatus for obtaining 
reproduction sounds having naturalness by producing not 

only low order harmonics components of a read-out 
original signal from a recording medium but also high 

order harmonics components by a simple construction and 
by adding them to the read-out original signal. Only 

the read-out original signal components whose 
frequencies are equal to or lower than 1/2 of the 

sampling frequency fs of the PCM digital audio signal 
obtained by reading out from the recording medium are 

extracted by an oversampling digital low-pass filter 
(1), the harmonics components are formed by multiplying 

an output audio signal of the oversampling digital low-pass 
filter (1) and a signal including its absolute 

value component, and the harmonics components whose 
frequencies are equal to or higher than fs/2 in the 

harmonics components are extracted and superimposed on 
the read-out original signal components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an audio signal
reproducing apparatus for reproducing an original audio
signal from a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) digital audio
signal obtained by reading out from a recording medium
such as a compact disc.In a recording medium such as compact disc (CD),
digital audio tape (DAT), or the like in which a digital
audio signal is recorded, a recording frequency of the
digital audio signal is a frequency of a band which is
equal to or less than the half of a sampling frequency so
as not to cause an aliasing distortion by the sampling
theorem.It is generally said that a frequency of a single
signal tone (pure tone) which a person can hear is equal
to 20 kHz. By this reason, the sampling frequency is
determined to be 44.1 kHz in the case of a compact disc
and is determined to be 48 kHz in the case of a digital
audio tape.However, in the recent researches, it has been
discussed that an unnatural reproduction sound is
generated in the case where a high frequency component of 
an audio signal is cut by using a filter having frequency
characteristics in which the response curve steeply falls
at 20 kHz, as in the apparatuses designed so far.To cope with this problem, development of
reproducing apparatuses such as a CD player or the like
which can reproduce signal components of frequencies
which are equal to or higher than half the sampling
frequency is being performed. For example, there is
proposed an apparatus in which read-out original signal
components whose frequencies are equal to or lower than
half the sampling frequency are extracted from the
digital audio signal obtained by reading out from a
recording medium, and harmonics components are produced
by squaring (multiplying by itself) or cubing the
original signal components by using a multiplier or
multipliers and are superimposed on the read original
signal components. Such an apparatus is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Kokai No. 4-245062 (EP-A-0 497 050).In this conventional apparatus, low order harmonics
components such as secondary harmonics, tertiary
harmonics, or the like can be formed by using a small
number of multipliers. In order to form high order
harmonics components, however, it is necessary to use an
arrangement including multi-stage connected multipliers,
so that a problem arises that the construction becomes
complicated. It is therefore an object of the invention to
provide an audio signal reproducing apparatus which can
produce reproduction sounds having naturalness by forming
not only low order harmonics

An audio signal reproducing apparatus for
reproducing an original audio signal from a PCM digital

audio signal obtained by reading out from a recording
medium, comprising:


an oversampling digital low-pass filter (1) for
receiving said PCM digital audio signal, for attenuating

components whose frequencies are equal to or higher than
substantially 1/2 of a sampling frequency of said PCM

digital audio signal, and for increasing the sampling
frequency by n times (n is an integer of 2 or more),

thereby interpolating a new sampling point;
digital multiplying means (4) for multiplying an
output audio signal of said oversampling digital low-pass

filter;
a digital high-pass filter (5) for attenuating
output audio signal components of said multiplying means

whose frequencies are equal to or lower than
substantially 1/2 of said sampling frequency; and
adding means (6) for adding the output audio signal
of said low-pass filter (1) and an output audio signal

of said high-pass filter (5) and outputting an obtained
addition signal as a reproduction signal of said

original audio signal, characterised in that said
digital multiplying means (4) multiplies the output

audio signal of said oversampling digital low-pass
filter (1) by a signal including the absolute value

component of said output audio signal.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1, further
comprising harmonics component detecting means (9)

connected to said oversampling digital low-pass filter
(1) for producing a switch control signal based on

harmonics components contained in said output audio 
signal, and a switch (8) interposed between said digital

high-pass filter (1) and adding means (6), for
interrupting the transmission of said output audio

signal of said high-pass filter in accordance with a
state of said switch control signal.
