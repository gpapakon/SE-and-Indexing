<ABSTRACT>
The process for the preparation of a silicate-bonded coating system, enhanced by a synthetic-resin dispersion, in the form of paints, filling compositions, primers, wall coverings and plasters allows high stability on storage to be achieved while retaining viscosity, by temporarily heating to about 50@C the mixture of potassium silicate and acrylate copolymer based on synthetic-resin dispersion, with stirring, the term "temporarily" referring advantageously to a period of about 15 minutes. It has proven favourable to cool the dispersion, prepared by polymerisation of the monomers at a temperature of about 80@C, by mixing in cold potassium silicates, again preferably with stirring.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of a silicate-bound
coating system which is enhanced by a synthetic-resin

dispersion and is in the form of paints, filling compositions,
primers, renders and plasters, characterized in

that the mixture of potassium silicate and acrylate
copolymer based on a synthetic-resin dispersion is heated

with stirring to 50°C for about 15 minutes or in that an
80°C hot polymer dispersion is cooled to 50°C by admixing

cold potassium silicate.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that commerically available styrene/acrylate dispersions

having a film-formation temperature of from 10 to 25°C
are employed as the synthetic-resin dispersion.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that potassium silicates having weight

moduli of SiO
2
:K
2
O of from 2.0 to 3.5:1 (tri-/tetrasilicates)
are employed as silicate.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the synthetic-resin dispersion used is Acronal®

290 D from BASF.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the silicate employed is Betolin® K 28 or Betolin®

P 35 from Woellner or Trasol® KCK from Henkel.
