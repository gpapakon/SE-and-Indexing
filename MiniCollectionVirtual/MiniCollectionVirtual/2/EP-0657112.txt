<ABSTRACT>
Comfort inner boot (bootee) intended to be arranged inside a shell part of a sports shoe, such as a ski boot. The inner boot (1) represents a single-piece structure including an envelope (6) for enclosing the foot, which envelope has a vamp (7) and an upper (8), a frame (13) and at least one support and comfort wedge (11) which is independent of the envelope (6) and which is connected to the frame (13) by pivoting/sliding links (16). This support wedge (11) is arranged opposite an elastic zone (9) of the envelope (6) for enclosing the foot, and it comes into close contact with said elastic zone upon closure of the shell part of the boot into which the inner boot (1) is placed.
