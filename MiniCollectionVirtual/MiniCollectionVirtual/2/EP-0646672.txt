<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated fabrics and more 
particularly to coated fabrics which are flame retardant. 
The coated fabrics may be used in the construction of air 
bags. Coated fabrics which have been used in air bags are 
described in U.S. 3,814,458 to Acs in which a nylon fabric 
or fiber glass is coated with aluminumized neoprene. U.S. 
4,921,735 to Bloch describes an air bag for a motor vehicle 
which is constructed of shrinkable and thermofixable synthetic 
fibers such as polyester, aramid, polyphenylene sulfide 
and polyimide. The air bag is made exclusively of synthetic 
fibers having a super-filled weave and is resistant to 
aging, decay and can be packed tightly without danger of 
adjacent layers sticking to each other. U.S. 5,073,418 to 
Thornton, et al., discloses that low permeability fabrics 
used in air bags are conventionally made of nylon or polyester 
which has been coated with neoprene, urethane or 
silicone resin, even though the coating necessarily 
increases the thickness, stiffness and cost of the cloth 
while reducing its flexibility, tear strength and shelf-life 
as the coatings tend to degrade over time. One of the disadvantages of using coated fabrics in the 
construction of air bags is that they have a tendency to  
 
self adhere when folded very compactly over a period of 
time. In order to reduce the tendency of the air bag to 
adhere to itself, it is necessary to treat the rubberized 
surface with talcum powder to keep the adjacent rubberized 
surfaces from adhering to one another over a period of time. 
However, when the air bag is required to perform and unfold 
explosively, the talcum powder is blown into the air where 
it can penetrate into the eyes and breathing passages of the 
passengers, with obvious adverse effects. U.S. 5,208,097 to Honma et al., describes a base fabric 
for an air bag coated with a silicone rubber, in which the 
surface of a fabric comprised of a polyamide fiber or polyester 
fiber is coated with a thermosetting organopolysiloxane 
product comprised of an unvulcanized organopolysiloxane 
rubber containing 2 or more alkenyl groups in a molecule, 
silica in the form of a fine powder, an organopolysiloxane 
containing at least 5 silicon atoms in the main chain and 
further containing 1 or more trialkoxysilyl groups, bonded 
with a silicon atom through a carbon atom, 1 or more 
epoxyalkyl groups and 3 or more hydrogen atoms bonded with a 
silicon atom, a catalyst for the hydrosilylation reaction 
and an organic solvent and thereafter the
