<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a synthesis reaction column which can be conveniently implemented in post synthesis procedures. The reaction column is configured to allow easy connection to a syringe and post synthesis reagent container without requiring connection adapters. In one embodiment, the reaction column (17') configured in the form of a cylindrical column containing the solid-phase support (42) and having a narrow bore tube (18) extending at one end. The tube functions as a piercing tip for accessing a septum sealed vial (60) containing post synthesis reagent. In another embodiment, the reaction column (17'') is configured in the form of a cylindrical barrel (70) enclosing the solid-phase support (74) and having a threaded mount (80) at one end. To complement the reaction column for post synthesis procedures, a vial (92) having a complementary threaded mount (94) at the opening is used for containing a reagent. This vial (92) is conveniently threaded onto the end of the barrel (70) without adapters. Consequently, post synthesis procedures can be implemented conveniently. Both embodiments may be conveniently connected to the reagent delivery system in an automated instrument for carrying out synthesis procedures, as well as post synthesis procedures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic 
synthesis, and more particularly to a device 
for implementing cleavage and deprotection process in 
solid-phase nucleic acid synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis (generally referred to 
as "DNA synthesis") is well known. Generally, this is 
the process of constructing synthetic single-stranded 
oligonucleotide through linking of nucleotide, the basic 
building blocks for DNA. DNA synthesis is described 
generally in U.S. Patent No. 4,458,066 issued to 
Caruthers et al, entitled "Process for Preparing 
Polynucleotides". 
The process described therein constructs a 
single-stranded oligonucleotide using one of several 
approaches in synthesizing DNA, namely the so-called 
solid-phase phosphoramidite method which generally 
involves the steps of deblocking/activation, coupling, 
capping and oxidation in each synthesis cycle for linking 
a building block on a solid-phase support. Further 
reference to this process of DNA synthesis may be found 
in "Oligonucleotide Synthesis - A Practical Approach" 
edited by M. J. Gait, IRL Press, 1984; 
and in particular 
Chapter 3 therein entitled "Solid-Phase Synthesis of 
Oligodeoxyribonucleotide by the Phosphite-Triester 
Method" written by Tom Atkinson and Michael Smith.  
 In an automated system, the various steps are 
carried out by a reagent delivery system which dispenses 
a number of chemical reagents in a predetermined sequence 
in a cycle into a synthesis reaction column containing 
the solid-phase support, according to instructions from 
the system controller or computer. After the desired 
number of cycles have been completed, the synthesized 
oligonucleotide is separated from the reaction column and 
collected in a vial. This step is generally referred to 
as "cleavage". The oligonucleotide may further be 
subject to a step generally referred to as "deprotection" 
to complete isolation of the oligonucleotide. The isolation of oligonucleotide involves the 
treatment of the solid bound oligonucleotide with a 
cleavage and/or deprotection reagent. Typically, this 
reagent is concentrated ammonia solution in water but can 
be other homogeneous or heterogeneous solutions of 
appropriate bases, alcohols and water. The cleavage and 
deprotection process is typically performed in two steps. 
The cleavage of the oligonucleotide is performed at room 
temperature for approximately one hour before decanting 
the mixture into a pressure-sealable vessel for extended 
higher temperature treatment to effect the removal of 
secondary
