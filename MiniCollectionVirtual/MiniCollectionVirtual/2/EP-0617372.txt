<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an apparatus for determining 
a control parameter t₀ at which the sum S of n functions Fi(t) (i = 1,..,n), 
reaches a minimum, a maximum, or a given value, wherein each function 
Fi(t) is changing or is assumed to change its first derivative only at given 
discrete values tij of the parameter t. It is concerned particularly, but not 
exclusively, with means to determine the optimum threshold value in a 
scheduling process to achieve throughput fairness between the users of a 
ring or bus-based communication system protocolled by cyclic 
reservation multiple access (CRMA). A function which changes its first 
derivative only at discrete values is also known as being piecewise linear. 
A piecewise linear function is linear within successive intervals of 
non-zero length, the borders of which are identical with the discrete 
values of tij at which it changes its first derivative. Its second derivative, 
therefore, consists of discrete impulse functions, also known as Dirac or 
delta (δ-) functions. Also disclosed is the a gate array which may be used 
in the apparatus. Though the basic principles of evaluating the extreme values of a given 
function are known, increasing demand exists for apparatus able to 
perform such evaluation at increased speed. The demand arises from 
different technical fields, such as process control and communication 
network control. In these technical fields, often a physical or technical 
parameter is observed as a function of time or space. These functions or 
their derivatives serve as input to a control unit, such as a microcomputer 
or the like. After evaluating the input measurement, the control unit activates or 
instructs the subsequent operating units. Part of the evaluation process 
includes in many cases a min-max problem or a comparison of the values 
of the measured function to a given reference value. In general, these  
 
problems are solved by known numerical techniques or algorithms cast 
into a code executable by the controlling processor. The speed of these 
known techniques crucially depends on the instruction cycle time of the 
microprocessor. Although this cycle time has been significantly 
decreased in the past, real-time applications demand a higher execution 
speed than known programmed general purpose processors can provide. 
One important example of such a high-speed application relates to 
communication networks, where data transfer rates are approaching the 
Gbit/s region. Specific types of networks are
