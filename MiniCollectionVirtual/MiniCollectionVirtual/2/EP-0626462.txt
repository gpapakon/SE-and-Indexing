<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to iron-based alloys with a low coefficient of expansion, containing at least 34% of nickel, in particular for the manufacture of shadow masks for colour television sets. The invention is characterized in that an iron/nickel ratio from 1.75 to 1.83 with the coefficients of thermal expansion of less than 1 x 10
<
-6
>
/K is set for use in the temperature range from 20 to 100@C, and an iron/nickel ratio from 1.68 to 1.72 with coefficients of thermal expansion of less than 2 x 10
<
-6
>
/K is set for use in the temperature range from 20 to 200@C.
