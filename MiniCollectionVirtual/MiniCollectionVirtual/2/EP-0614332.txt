<ABSTRACT>
A helically-movable machine for pruning standing trees, comprising: a frame with at least two brackets (2A, 2B), known as raising brackets, which are arranged one above the other along an axis defining the forward moving direction of the machine, and consist of two arms extending away from an apex; a drive wheel (6); and a plurality of guide wheels (3A, 3A', 3A'', 3A'''; 3B, 3B', 3B'', 3B'''; 3C, 3C', 3C'', 3C'''; 3D, 3D', 3D'', 3D''') which are freely rotatably mounted along each arm of said brackets (2A, 2B), and have rotational axes having, in the plane defined with the corresponding arms, an inclination relative to the frame axis which diminishes from the apex towards the end of the arm so that the forward motion increment remains constant regardless of variations in the trunk diameter of the tree to be pruned. The machine may be used for pruning and barking trees before they are felled.

Helicoidally-movable type of machine for 
pruning standing trees, characterised in that said 

machine comprises: 

a frame comprising at least two brackets (2A, 2B) 
known as raising brackets, which are raised one above 

the other along an axis defining the forward moving 
direction of the machine, said brackets (2A, 2B) being 

constituted by two arms extending away from an apex, a 
drive wheel (6) 
a plurality of guide wheels (3A, 3A', 3A'', 3A''', 
3B, 3B', 3B'', 3B''', 3C, 3C' , 3C'', 3C''', 3D, 3D', 3D'', 

3D''') which are mounted so as to be rotationally free 
along each arm of said brackets (2A, 2B), and have 

rotational axes having, in the plane defined with the 
corresponding arms, an inclination relative to the 

frame axis that diminishes from the apex towards the 
end of the arm so as to obtain a forward motion 

increment that remains constant regardless of the 
variations in the trunk diameter of the tree to be 

pruned. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said drive wheel (6) has an axis of rotation 

parallel to the frame axis and has, on its periphery, a 
plurality of disks (6A mounted so as to be rotationally 

free transversally to the drive wheel (6) and 
projecting radially. 
Machine according to one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the frame also comprises at least 

two brackets (35, 36), called lowering brackets, 
sliding towards the interior of said frame with respect 

to the raising brackets (2A, 2B) so as to rest against 
the trunk of the tree to be pruned and release said 

raising brackets from the tree trunk after pruning, at 
least one (35) of the lowering brackets bearing at 

least one lowering motor roller (34A, 34B).  
 
Machine according to any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the frame has a hinged arm (4) 

acted on by a drawback spring (5), designed to hold the 
arms of the brackets (2a, 2b) resting against the trunk 

of the tree to be pruned. 
Machine according to any of the claims 1 to 3 
and according to claim 4, characterised in that the 

drive wheel (6) is borne a motor (7) called a feed 
motor, and wherein the unit formed by the drive wheel 

(6) and the feed motor (7) is mounted so as to be 
rotationally free with respect to the hinged arm (4). 
Machine according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the feed motor (7) has a lever (11) at the end of 

which there is fixed a counter-rotation freewheel (12). 
Machine according to claim 6, characterised in 
that said counter-rotation wheel (12) has an axis of 

rotation inclined with respect to the axis of the 
frame. 
Machine according to any of the claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that a safety bar (30) is hinged at 

one end to said hinged arm (4) and slides freely 
through a guide (30A) that is fixed with respect to the 

frame. 
Machine according to any of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that said machine comprises. 


a cutting unit supported by the frame comprising 
at least one pruning tool (10), 
a means (15, 15') for the detection of the upline 
contact of said pruning tool (10) with a branch to be 

lopped, 
a means (15A, 15'A) for avoiding said branch by 
the sliding of the pruning tool (10) parallel to the 

axis of the frame defining the direction of forward 
motion of the machine. 
Machine according to claim 9, characterised in 
that, the pruning tool (10) being a cylindrical tool  

 
rotating about an axis parallel to the axis of the 

frame defining the direction of forward motion of the 
machine, said means for the detection of upline contact 

and said avoidance means are constituted by a conical 
non-cutting head (15) helicoidally shaped with a thread 

in reverse to the nominal working rotation of the 
pruning tool (10). 
Machine according to claim 9, characterised in 
that said upline contact detection means is constituted 

by an electrical contactor (15') and in that said 
avoidance means is an electric jack (15'A) controlled 

by said electrical contactor (15'). 
Machine according to any of the claims 9 to 
11, characterised in that said pruning tool (10) 

comprises cutting depth guides (16, 17; 16', 17'). 
Machine according to claim 12, characterised 
in that the pruning tool (10) comprises a fixed upline 

cutting depth guide (16') and a fixed downline cutting 
depth guide (17') forming an integral part of said 

pruning tool (10). 
Machine according to claim 12, characterised 
in that the pruning tool (10) comprises an adjustable 

upline cutting depth guide (16) and a fixed downline 
cutting depth guide (17'). 
Machine according to any of the claims 9 to 
14, characterised in that said cutting unit is mounted 

rotationally about an axis parallel to the axis of the 
frame defining the direction of forward motion of the 

machine and acted on by a drawback spring (13) designed 
to apply said pruning tool (10) against the trunk of 

the tree to be pruned. 
Machine according any of the claims 9 to 15, 
characterised in that said cutting unit also comprises 

a tool (40) for sawing the tree trunk into balks after 
pruning.  

 
Machine according to claim 16, characterised 
in that said balk-sawing tool is a cutting chain (40) 

pivoting in an axis perpendicular to the axis of the 
frame. 
Machine according to any of the claims 9 to 
17, characterised in that it has servo-control means 

that are capable, in the event of major resistance 
applied to the pruning tool (10), of accelerating the 

pruning motor (8) and slowing down the forward motion 
of the machine. 
Machine according to any of the claims 1 to 
18, characterised in that it has a means for 

determining cubic content capable of giving the volume 
of wood that has been w
orked.
