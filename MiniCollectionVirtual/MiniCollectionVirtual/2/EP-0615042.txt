<ABSTRACT>
A door locking mechanism 8 is described having an espagnolette 
mechanism interconnecting longitudinally movable bolts 12 at the 

periphery of a door 4. The bolts 12 have individual deadlocking 
mechanisms that serve to prevent their own movement and via the 

espagnolette mechanism the movement of all the other parts of the door 
locking mechanism 8. The bolts 12 are deadlocked by the action of a 

bush 26 fitted within a slot 24 in the bolts 12 and applying a 
transverse force thereto. The deadlocking of the bolts 12 serves to 

compress the door 4 shut.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to door fasteners. More particularly, 
this invention relates to door fasteners that may be incorporated in an 
espagnolette mechanism. Many different sorts of door locking mechanisms are known. One 
such sort of known door locking mechanism is the espagnolette 
mechanism, in which moving a single handle or lock serves to actuate a 
plurality of fasteners at the periphery of the door. Such door locking 
mechanisms are typically used in French windows and the like where they 
hold the door firmly shut using a plurality of fastening points. A requirement of door locking mechanisms is that they should be 
secure against unauthorised opening. These requirements are 
particularly important in situations where the door and door locking 
mechanism are accessible to the public. One such situation arises in 
the case of streetside cabinets used to hold electronic equipment, such 
as telephone, cable television and cellular radio apparatus, in outdoor 
locations. The equipment that is housed in such streetside cabinets 
can have a high financial value, be physically delicate and be required 
to maintain a high degree of reliability. In these circumstances, it 
is particularly important that the streetside cabinets should have door 
locking mechanisms that are highly secure so as to prevent vandalism 
and tampering with the equipment inside. It is known from FR-A-383899 to provide an espagnolette mechanism 
which compresses the door shut. It is known from US-A-4838589 to provide a door fastener having 
a retaining bar that may be internally secured by a finger-actuated 
nut. This document thereby discloses a door fastener according to 
the preamble of claim 1. It is known from US-A-2991106 to provide a fastener for a box 
having a catch that is tensioned along its longitudinal direction when 
hooked into engagement with a retainer and moved to its withdrawn 
position. The present invention provides a door fastener comprising: 
a fastener body, which in use is to be mounted on the inside of a door ; a threaded stud extending from said fastener body; a bush having a threaded bore engaging said threaded stud; and a bolt coupled to said fastener body by said bush, to which said bolt is slidably coupled, so a to be  
 
longitudinally movable between an extended position and a withdrawn 
position relative to said fastener body;  
   characterised in that, the end of the threaded stud, which in use is directed towards the 
outside of the door, comprises means for engagement with a key whereby when

<CLAIMS>
A door fastener comprising: 

a fastener body (22), which in use is to be mounted on the inside of a door ; 
a threaded stud (38) extending from said fastener body; 
a bush (26) having a threaded bore (36) engaging said threaded 
stud; and 
a bolt (12) coupled to said fastener body (22) by said bush (26), to which said bolt (12) is slidably coupled so as to 
be longitudinally movable between an extended position and a withdrawn 

position relative to said fastener body (22); 
 
   characterised in that, the end of the threaded stud 

(38), which in use is directed towards the outside of the door, comprises means for engagement with a key (20), whereby when said bolt (12) is in said extended 
position, said threaded stud (38) is rotatable using said key (20) applied to 

said engagement means from the outside of the door in order to tighten said bush (26) against said bolt (12), thereby 
applying a force transverse to said bolt (12) such that the bolt (12) is moved transversely to hold said bolt deadlocked. 
A door fastener as claimed in claim 1, wherein said threaded stud (38) 
is coupled to a rotatable lock cylinder (50), which forms said key engagement means, and which is mounted in said fastener 

body (22), said lock cylinder (50) being engaged and driven by said key (20) and 
having means (52) for preventing rotation thereof when said door 

fastener is deadlocked. 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1 and 2, wherein 
complementary formations (48) on said fastener body (22) and said bolt (12) 

move into engagement as said bush (26) pulls said bolt (12) against said fastener 
body (22) thereby preventing longitudinal movement of said bolt (12). 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3, 
wherein said bolt (12) and said fastener body (22) are shaped to provide a pivot 

point (46) therebetween about which said bolt (12) pivots as said bush (26) 
tightens against said bolt (12). 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
comprising a spring (54) disposed between said bolt (12) and said fastener 

body (22) so as as to urge said bolt (12) away from said fastener body (22) and out of 
deadlock when said bush (26) is not tightened against said bolt (12). 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein,  
 

in use, said door fastener serves to compress a door (4) shut against 
a door frame (10). 
A door fastener as claimed in claim 6, wherein, when deadlocked, 
said bolt (12) hooks into engagement with said door frame. 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein 
said bush (26) slides within a slot (24) in said bolt (12). 
A door fastener as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein said bush (26) engages both faces of said bolt (12) so as to also serve 

to apply a force transverse to said bolt (12) to drive said bolt (12) away from 
deadlock. 
A door locking mechanism (8) comprising an espagnolette mechanism 
(14, 16) driving each of a plurality of door fasteners (12, 18, 

22) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 at differing edges of a door 
(4) between a withdrawn position and an extended position, each of said 

door fasteners thereby having an individual deadlocking mechanism located in 

its fastener body (22) for deadlocking said door fastener in said extended 
position thereby preventing further movement of said door fastener, 

said espagnolette mechanism (14, 16) and, via said espagnolette mechanism, other 
of said door fasteners. 
A door locking mechanism as claimed in claim 10, wherein said 
espagnolette mechanism has a central deadlock for preventing movement 

of said espagnolette mechanism to drive said door fasteners. 
A door locking mechanism as claimed in any one of claims 10 and 
11, wherein said espagnolette mechanism comprises a crank (14) and a 

plurality of rods (16) interconnected between ends of said crank (14) and 
said door fasteners for driving said fasteners, said crank (14) being 

movable through an over centre position to a closed stop position as 
said fasteners move to said extended position, whereby applying force 

to said door fasteners to return said door fasteners to said withdrawn 
position urges said crank (14) away from said over centre position and 

towards said closed stop position.  
 
Use of a door and a door locking mechanism as claimed in any one 
of claims 10, 11 and 12 in an electronic apparatus enclosure.
