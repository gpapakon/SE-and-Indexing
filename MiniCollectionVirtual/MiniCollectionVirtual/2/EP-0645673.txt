<ABSTRACT>
A photographic element that is useful as an 
imaging master in the field of graphic arts is 

comprised of a dimensionally-stable polyester film 
having a radiation-sensitive silver halide emulsion 

layer on one side thereof and having on the opposite 
side, in order, a latex subbing layer and a backing 

layer. The backing layer is comprised of gelatin, a 
matting agent, a filter dye and a blocked gelatin-hardening 

agent. In the manufacture of the 
photographic element, a high temperature heating step 

is employed to activate the blocked gelatin-hardening 
agent and thereby harden the backing layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to
photography and in particular to a novel photographic
element useful as an imaging master in the field of
graphic arts. More specifically, this invention
relates to a dimensionally-stable photographic element
comprising a support having a radiation-sensitive
silver halide emulsion layer on one side thereof and a
backing layer on the opposite side, and to a method for
manufacture of such photographic element.In the field of graphic arts, it is well
known to utilize as an imaging master a silver halide
photographic element comprising a dimensionally-stable
polyester film support. Polyester films are utilized
in such elements because their dimensional stability
characteristics are unsurpassed. However, because of
the difficulty of achieving strong bonding of overlying
hydrophilic colloid layers to such films, it is usually
necessary to employ a latex subbing layer between a
polyester film support and the overlying photographic
layer, such as a silver halide emulsion layer or a
backing layer. Latex subbing layers used to promote
the adhesion of coating compositions to polyester film
supports are very well known in the photographic art.
Useful compositions for this purpose include
interpolymers of vinylidene chloride such as vinylidene
chloride/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid terpolymers or
vinylidene chloride/methyl acrylate/itaconic acid
terpolymers. Such compositions are described in
numerous patents such as, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
2,627,088, 2,698,235, 2,698,240, 2,943,937, 3,143,421,
3,201,249, 3,271,178, 3,443,950 and 3,501,301. The 
latex subbing layer is typically overcoated with a
second subbing layer comprised of gelatin which is
typically referred to in the art as a "gel sub."
Functional layers, such as silver halide emulsion
layers containing gelatin or other hydrophilic colloid
as a binder, are then applied over the gel sub layer.Since photographic elements employed as
imaging masters in the field of graphic arts typically
have functional layers on both sides thereof, the
polyester films used as supports are commonly provided
on both sides with both a latex subbing layer and a gel
sub layer. Thus, a typical photographic element of
this type has a latex subbing layer, a gel sub layer
and a silver halide emulsion layer on one side and has
a latex subbing layer, a gel sub layer and a backing
layer on the opposite side.In photographic elements comprising a silver
halide emulsion layer on one side and a backing layer
on the opposite side, the backing layer has
