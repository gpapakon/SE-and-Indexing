<ABSTRACT>
It comprises: adding a cryoprotective agent into 
an aqueous dispersion of the cited nanocapsules maintaining 

gentle stirring until the same dissolves totally. 
Afterwards, the dispersion thus obtained is subjected 

to freezing at a temperature no lower than -40º C for 
about 2 to 4 hours, and, finally, eliminating the water 

by heating it progressively to a temperature of about 
35º C and at reduced pressure, whereby a stable lyophilized 

product is obtained. It can be conveniently reconstituted 
by addi
ng water or a more complex aqueous 
solution to it. 
Nanocapsules are used in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics, 
chemical industry, agriculture, veterinary 

science, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of 
lyophilization and, specifically, lyophilization of nanocapsules, 
submicron spheres formed by a lipidic nucleus 
surrounded by a polymeric membrane or a water insoluble 
substance. Lyophilization of nanocapsules makes it possible 
to increase their stability during storage thereof, 
in such a way that industrialization and subsequent marketing 
thereof for use in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics, 
chemical industry, agriculture, veterinary science, etc. 
become possible. Colloidal system of a polymeric nature in the form 
of nanocapsules and nanoparticles have been the object 
of numerous studies over the last few years. This is due 
to the fact that the use of this type of system for vehiculization 
of biologically active substances has brought 
about great expectations as a medium to reduce the doses 
of very toxic drugs and even to be directed towards a 
hypothetical target organ, among many other potential uses. However, the use of biodegradable polymers, which 
would permit their optional use in medicine, veterinary 
science, etc., poses the problem of their degradation in 
an aqueous medium which would make storage thereof impossible 
in the form of a colloidal suspension for the time 
needed to market them. On the other hand, given the collidal 
nature of these systems, there is a tendency to the 
instability of the same which gives rise to an aggregation 
of initially individualized nanocapsules, and even a loss 
of the encapsulated substance by diffusion through the 
polymeric membrane during storage thereof. Nanovesicular systems in the form of nanocapsules  
 
of a size smaller than on micrometer, formed by a solid 
or liquid lipidic nucleus containing one or more active 
substances, and surrounded by a membrane formed by a 
polymer or a water insoluble substance, have been described 
in different studies and inventions. However, suitable 
methods to increase the physical and physicochemical stability 
of the colloidal suspensions obtained have not been 
described, nor methods to prevent the degradation or 
dissolving of the polymers forming the wall, which would 
give rise to instabilization of the nanocapsules, causing 
them to break or the substance contained inside them from 
escaping. It is obvious, that upon not having the stability of 
these systems solved for long periods of storage time is a 
very important limitation for their potential industrial 
use and marketing. The patents BE-A 869107, FR-A 2504408 and FR-A 2515960

smaller than 1 micron and are formed by a lipid nucleus of a 
natural or synthetic origin and which contain at least one
