<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stacking device for piling paper sheets with upper belts conveying into a pile delivery. The aim is to make the device more reliable in the pile formation for high conveying speeds in a simplified construction. This is achieved in that the lower strands of the upper belts (23) transporting the sheets (26) are returned in front of the stop face of a front aligner (21) around a relatively sharp-edged belt deflection (29), the sheets being deflected downwards in the region of the belt deflection by fenders or stop plates (37 or 48) running at an acute angle to the conveying plane of the sheets and having openings (38) for the upper belts. In this way, the paper sheets are secured against curving up at their leading edge even at high conveying speeds, and a satisfactory pile is formed.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for piling up paper sheets or the like to form
stacks, having a multi-copy, lowerable stack receiver (16) as

well as transversely adjustable upper conveying belts (23)
associated with the latter and frontal aligning means (21)

passing substantially vertically through the conveying plane of
the paper sheets (26) and the lower strands of the upper

conveying belts (23), and having a belt-diverting means (29)
disposed in the region of the stack receiver (16) directly beside

the stop face of the frontal aligning means (21) and intended for
diverting the lover strands of the upper conveying belts (23),

a sheet deflector (37) intersecting the conveying plane of the
paper sheets (26) at an acute angle and having a through-opening

(38) for the lower strands of the upper conveying belts (23)
being associated with the belt-diverting means (29),

characterised in that a fixed sheet stop (48) set at an acute
angle to the conveying plane of the paper sheets (26) is disposed

between the transversely adjustable sheet deflectors (37) of the
multi-copy stack receiver (16).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
belt-diverting means (29) has a relatively sharp diverting edge

(31) diverting the lower strands at an acute angle.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the belt-diverting means (29) takes the form of a rigid, fixed

round bar (31).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the sheet deflectors (37) and upper conveying belts (23)

are laterally adjustable, dependent on the format, along a common
crossbar (36) carrying the belt-diverting means (29) by means of

a movable bridge (9). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the crossbar (36) is articulated on inwardly pivotable

adjusting means (43, 46, 47).
