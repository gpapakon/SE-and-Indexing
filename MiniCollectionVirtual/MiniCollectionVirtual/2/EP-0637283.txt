<ABSTRACT>
A plastic assay cuvette (506) having the desired optical properties for the analysis of a test sample or reaction mixture thereof, and a method for making such a plastic assay cuvette (506), are described. The optical properties of the plastic assay cuvette (506) are substantially the same as the optical properties of glass wherein low birefringence throughout the optical read region (516) thereof is provided. When used for the analysis of a test sample or reaction mixture thereof, such as in fluorescence polarization assays and absorbance assays, the plastic assay cuvette (506) provides accurate and reproducible disposable assay cuvette which can be used in place of conventional glass assay cuvettes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part application of
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/859,218, filed March 27,
1992, which is incorporated by reference herein.The present invention relates to assay cuvettes for the
analysis of liquid test samples. In particular, the present
invention relates to plastic assay cuvettes having low
birefringence for the analysis of liquid test samples in
analytical systems.In order to meet the growing demands of the modern
clinical laboratory to provide cost effective services,
requiring that operating expenditures such as labor costs and
cost of materials costs be reduced, reliance on low-cost
disposable materials has increased. In addition, the use of
automated clinical analyzers, which improve the efficiency of
the laboratory procedures inasmuch as the operator has fewer
tasks to perform and therefor reduce operating labor costs,
has also increased.The analysis of a test sample generally involves direct
analysis of the test sample, or involves the reaction of the
test sample with one or more reagents with respect to one or
more analytes, wherein a reaction mixture is formed, either
manually or by an automated instrument, comprising the test
sample and one or more reagents. Generally, the test sample
or reaction mixture is then deposited in a cuvette and read or
otherwise analyzed by an analytical system or apparatus for
one or more characteristics of the test sample. For example,
in the case of an absorbance assay or a fluorescence 
polarization assay for determining the presence or amount of
an analyte in a test sample, the absorbance or fluorescence
polarization response of the reaction mixture, respectively, in
a reaction cuvette is measured by the apparatus and, if
analyte is present, correlated to the presence or amount
thereof in the test sample. Analysis of a test sample or
reaction mixture is typically accomplished by directing a
beam of light or other source of energy into or through an
optical read region of a cuvette containing the test sample or
reaction mixture, and then detecting or measuring the
resulting response therefrom.In order to provide rapid turnaround and prevent cross-contamination
of test samples, cuvettes are employed for a
single analysis and are then discarded. Various assay
cuvettes for the analysis of test samples have been described.
In most instances, reaction cuvettes made from glass are
employed for such analyses due to the physical properties of
glass which permit reproducible and accurate results and
which are required for
