<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a gas-cooled electrical machine, the effective flow cross-section of the connection from the outer hot gas chambers (23) to the radiator (18) is provided with adjustable throttling devices (restrictor devices) (28; see also Fig. 3: 29,31; 32,33). In this way, the splitting of the various cooling air flows within the machine can be influenced, without any intervention in the actual machine, such that the temperature level is made uniform in the longitudinal direction of the machine.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical machine having a housing (5) which 
is arranged on a foundation (17) having a foundation 

pit, having a laminated stator core (9) which is 
arranged in this housing and has stator winding 

conductors which are arranged in slots on the internal 
circumference of said laminated stator core and are 

cooled indirectly, and having a rotor (11), the 
laminated core (9) of the stator being constructed from 

individual laminated core elements which are separated 
from one another by spacer webs, and the intermediate 

spaces between two successive laminated core elements 
forming radially running cooling slits, and the cooling 

slits connecting the machine air gap (21) to chambers 
which are located between the external circumference of 

the laminated stator core and the housing, which 
chambers comprise cold-gas chambers (25), which can be 

acted on by cold cooling gas, and hot-gas chambers (23, 
24) into which heated cooling gas flows, directed 

radially outwards from said cooling slits, which hot-gas 
chambers are connected to coolers (18), and 

cooling-gas conveying means (15) and cooling-gas 
guidance devices (4) being provided at both machine 

ends, which means and devices supply the cooled gas to 
the cold-gas chambers as cold gas and suck the heated 

cooling gas out of the hot-gas chambers again, 
characterized in that restrictor devices (28) are 

arranged in the outlet cross-section (26) of the hot-gas 
chambers (23) at the ends, between said chambers 

and the cooler (18). 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the restrictor device comprises a [sic]
 a metal 
plate, preferably a plurality of metal plates (29), 

which is or are provided with perforations (31). 
Machine according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the metal plate (29) interacts with a perforated 

plate (32) whose perforations (33) are arranged and 
distributed in such a manner that a  

 
predetermined effective cross-sectional constriction 

can be achieved by displacing the perforated plate (32) 
relative to the metal plate (29). 
Machine according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that at least the metal plate (29) is 

divided into a plurality of plate elements (29a, 29b) 
in order to simplify assembly/disassembly. 
Machine according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the metal plate comprises a 

plurality of plate elements (29c, 29d, 29e) which are 
spaced apart from one another and leave a gap (S) free 

between them. 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the plate elements (29c, 29d, 29e) interact 

with a slitted plate (35) whose slits (36) are arranged 
and distributed in such a manner that a predetermined 

effective cross-sectional constriction can be achieved 
by displacing the slitted plate (36) relative to the 

plate elements.
