<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a compressed-air actuated disc brake (air brake) with a brake caliper (2) surrounding a brake disc (1) on one side of which there is an actuating device (3) which, on the application of compressed air, actuates at least one control spindle (72, 73) arranged to move in a crosshead (7) and acting via a pressure member (70, 71) fitted on its end towards the brake disc on the pressure plate of a brake lining (10) fitted on the actuation side of the caliper (2) so as to move in relation to the brake disc (1). An automatic adjusting device (74) maintains the gap, which alters as the brake lining wears, constant by acting on the control spindle(s) (72, 73). In order to minimise oblique wear, the invention proposes that the force transfer area between the pressure member (70, 71) of the control spindle (72, 73) and the pressure plate (80) of the brake lining (10) be constructed in such a way that the brake lining (10) is asymmetrically loaded in the peripheral and/or radial directions of the brake disc (1).

Compressed-air actuated disk brake comprising a caliper 

(2)
 which reaches around a brake disk 
(1)
 and on one 
side of which an application device 
(3)
 is arranged 
which acts on at least one actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 
adjustably arranged in a traverse 
(7)
 in response to 
actuation by compressed air, said actuating spindle 


(72, 73)
 acting on the pressure plate 
(80)
 of a brake 
lining 
(10)
 displaceably mounted with respect to said 
brake disk 
(1)
 through a pressure member 
(70, 71)
 
mounted on the end thereof facing said brake disk, an 

adjusting means 
(74)
 maintaining the clearance varying 
due to lining wear essentially constant by acting on 

said actuating spindle(s) 
(72, 73),
characterized in that
 
the force transfer surface between the respective 

pressure member 
(70, 71)
 of said actuating spindle 
(72, 
73)
 and said pressure plate 
(80)
 of said brake lining 

(10)
 is designed such that said brake lining 
(10)
 
receives an asymmetrical load in the peripheral and/or 

radial directions of the brake disk 
(1)
. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the region of said pressure 
plate 
(80)
 of said brake lining 
(10)
 facing the respective 
pressure member 
(70, 71)
 has a conical chamfer in 
the peripheral and/or radial directions. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the surface of the respective 
pressure member 
(70, 71)
 facing said pressure plate 

(80)
 of said brake lining 
(10)
 has a conical chamfer in 
the peripheral and/or radial directions.  

 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 2 
or 3, 
characterized in that
 the maximum value of the 
respective chamfer is limited by taking into consideration 

the effective support area between pressure member 

(70, 71)
 and pressure plate 
(80)
. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a single actuating 
spindle is provided in the traverse 
(7)
 in an approximately 
central position. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 said traverse 
(7)
 
comprises two actuating spindles 
(72, 73)
 in parallel 
arrangement, the two force transfer surfaces being 

chamfered essentially in the radial direction.
