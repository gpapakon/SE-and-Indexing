<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for removing 
CO₂ (carbon dioxide) from a combustion exhaust gas, and more 
specifically, it relates to a method for efficiently removing 
CO₂ from a combustion exhaust gas under atmospheric pressure 
by the use of a mixed aqueous solution of specific amines. In recent years, the greenhouse effect of CO₂ has been 
noted as one cause of the global warming, and prompt efforts 
against it have gathered an international attention in order 
to protect the earth environment. Sources of CO₂ release are 
found in all human activities in which fossil fuel is burned, 
and the restriction requirements and regulations on the CO₂ 
release are being further tightened. Thus, for power generation 
facilities such as thermoelectric power plants in which 
a large amount of fossil fuel is used, methods have been 
studied for removing and collecting CO₂ from combustion 
exhaust gases by bringing the combustion exhaust gas from a 
boiler into contact with an aqueous alkanolamine solution or 
the like, and also methods for storing the collected CO₂ 
without discharging it into the atmosphere have been studied  
 
intensively. Examples of such alkanolamine include monoethanolamine, 
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine, 
diisopropanolamine and diglycolamine, and in general, 
monoethanolamine (MEA) is preferably used. However, even if 
the above-mentioned aqueous alkanolamine solution typified by 
MEA is used as an absorbing solution for absorbing/removing 
CO₂ from a combustion exhaust gas, the use of such 
alkanolamine is not always satisfactory in view of such 
problems as an amount of absorbed CO₂ per unit amount of the 
aqueous amine solution having a given concentration, an 
amount of absorbed CO₂ per unit mole of amine in the aqueous 
amine solution having a given concentration, an absorption 
rate of CO₂ at a given concentration, heat energy required to 
regenerate the aqueous alkanolamine solution after the 
absorption, and the like. For the separation of an acidic gas from various mixed 
gases by the use of an amine compound, many techniques are 
already known. Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 100180/1978 
discloses a method for removing an acidic gas which includes 
bringing a mixture which is normally gaseous into contact 
with an amine-solvent liquid absorbent comprising: (1) an 
amine mixture comprising at least 50 mole % of a sterically 
hindered amine having at least one secondary amino group  
 
which is a part of a ring and bonded to either
