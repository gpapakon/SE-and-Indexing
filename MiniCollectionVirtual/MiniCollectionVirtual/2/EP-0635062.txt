<ABSTRACT>
A method of locating an inhibitory/instability sequence or sequences within the coding region of an mRNA and modifying the gene encoding that mRNA to remove these inhibitory/instability sequences by making clustered nucleotide substitutions without altering the coding capacity of the gene is disclosed. Constructs containing these mutated genes and host cells containing these constructs are also disclosed. The method and constructs are exemplified by the mutation of a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Rev-dependent gag gene to a Rev-independent gag gene. Constructs useful in locating inhibitory/instability sequences within either the coding region or the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA are also disclosed. The exemplified constructs of the invention may also be useful in HIV-1 immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
U.S. Serial No. 07/858,747, filed March 27, 1992.The invention relates to methods of increasing
the stability and/or utilization of a mRNA produced by a
gene by mutating regulatory or inhibitory/instability
sequences (INS) in the coding region of the gene which
prevent or reduce expression. The invention also relates
to constructs, including expression vectors, containing
genes mutated in accordance with these methods and host
cells containing these constructs.The methods of the invention are particularly
useful for increasing the stability and/or utilization of
a mRNA without changing its protein coding capacity.
These methods are useful for allowing or increasing the
expression of genes which would otherwise not be expressed
or which would be poorly expressed because of the presence
of INS regions in the mRNA transcript. Thus, the methods,
constructs and host cells of the invention are useful for
increasing the amount of protein produced by any gene
which encodes an mRNA transcript which contains an INS.The methods, constructs and host cells of the
invention are useful for increasing the amount of protein
produced from genes such as those coding for growth
factors, interferons, interleukins, the fos proto-oncogene
protein, and HIV-1 gag and env, for example.The invention also relates to using the
constructs of the invention in immunotherapy and
immunoprophylaxis, e.g., as a vaccine, or in genetic
therapy after expression in humans. Such constructs can
include or be incorporated into retroviral or other 
expression vectors or they may also be directly injected
into tissue cells resulting in efficient expression of the
encoded protein or protein fragment. These constructs may
also be used for in-vivo or in-vitro gene replacement,
e.g., by homologous recombination with a target gene in-situ.The invention also relates to certain
exemplified constructs which can be used to simply and
rapidly detect and/or define the boundaries of
inhibitory/instability sequences in any mRNA, methods of
using these constructs, and host cells containing these
constructs. Once the INS regions of the mRNAs have been
located and/or further defined, the nucleotide sequences
encoding these INS regions can be mutated in accordance
with the method of this invention to allow the increase in
stability and/or utilization of the mRNA and, therefore,
allow an increase in the amount of protein produced from
expression vectors encoding the mutated mRNA.While much work has been devoted to
