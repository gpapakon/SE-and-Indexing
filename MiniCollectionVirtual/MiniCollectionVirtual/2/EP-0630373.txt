<ABSTRACT>
A compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof wherein P represents a quinoline or isoquinoline residue or a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring containing up to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur; R1 is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; R2, R3, R10 and R11 are independently hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl, or R10 and R11 together form a bond, or R2 and R10 or R3 and R11 together form a C2-6 alkylene chain; R4 is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, halogen, NR8R9, OR12 or COOR12, where R8, R9 and R12 are independently hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; and R7 is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy or halogen; and wherein the urea moiety is attached at the 4-, 5- or 6-position of the indole or indoline ring, provided that P is not pyridyl when R10 and R11 form a bond, which has been found to have 5HT1C receptor antagonist activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INDOLE DERIVATIVES AS 5HT1 C ANTAGONISTSThis invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of mammals.P. Fludzinski et aL, J. Med. Chem. 1986 29 2415-2418 describes N-(l,2-d_ methyl-3-ethyl-lH-indol-5-yl)-N'- (3-trifluoromethylphenyl)urea which shows selectivity for the rat stomach fundus serotonin receptor.A class of compounds has now been discovered which have been found to have 5HT-J. Q receptor antagonist activity. 5HTIQ receptor antagonists are believed to be of potential use in the treatment of CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, anorexia, Alzheimers disease, sleep disorders, bulimia, panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine, and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury, such as hydrocephalus.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:(I)wherein:P represents a quinoline or isoquinoline residue or a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring containing up to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur; Rl is hydrogen or Cι_6 alkyl;R2, R3, Rio and R-J^J are independently hydrogen or C^.g alkyl, or R-^o and 11 together form a bond, or R2 and R^Q OΓ ^3 an^ &11 together form 

a C2-6 alkylene chain;R is hydrogen, Cι_g alkyl, halogen, NRgRp,, O 12 or COOR12, where Rg, Eg and R 2 are independently hydrogen or C^.g alkyl; R5 and g are independently hydrogen or Cι_g alkyl; and R7 is hydrogen, Cι_g alkyl, C _.g alkoxy or halogen; and wherein the urea moiety is attached at the 4-, 5- or 6-position of the indole or indoline ring, provided that P is not pyridyl when RJQ an^ -^11 ^orιn a bond.Alkyl moieties within the variables Ri to R12 are preferably C1.3 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n- and iso- propyl, most preferably methyl.Suitable R4 and R7 halogens include chloro and bromo.Examples of Ri include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and n-propyl, preferably methyl.R2 and R3 are preferably hydrogen. io and n are preferably a bond so as to form an indole structure. In an indoline structure, o and Rn are preferably hydrogen.Preferably R is hydrogen or methyl, most preferably hydrogen.Preferably R5, Rg and R7 are hydrogen.The urea moiety can be attached to a carbon or nitrogen atom of the ring P, preferably it is attached to a carbon atom.Suitable moieties when the ring P is a 5- or 6-membered
