<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microswitch (1) having a housing (2), having a switching plunger (4) (which is arranged offset with respect to the centre of the housing, projects out of the housing and has connecting contacts (22, 23, 24) which are arranged on that side of the housing which is opposite the switching plunger and are electrically conductively connected to stationary contacts (19, 20, 21) which are located within the housing) and having a contact link (13) which can be moved via the switching plunger from a first switch position to a second switch position and has at least one switching contact (15), the contact link being held in the first switch position or the second switch position, by means of a bistable spring arrangement, as a function of the plunger position. In order to enable disconnection of two welded switch contacts, the switch is provided with a switching plunger which has a cantilever arm (12) which extends on one side and on whose free end a hold-down device (10) is provided which is arranged a short distance away from the contact link when said contact link is in the first switch position and which, in the second switch position, projects into the movement path over which the contact link travels.

Microswitch (1) having a housing (2), having a 
switching plunger (4) which is arranged offset with 

respect to the centre of the housing (2) and projects 
from the housing (2), having connection contacts (22, 23, 

24) which are arranged on that side of the housing (2) 
which is opposite to the switching plunger (4) and are 

electrically conductively connected to fixed contacts 
(19, 20, 21) situated inside the housing (2), and having 

a contact bridge (13) which can be transferred from a 
first to a second switch position by means of the switching 

plunger (4) and has at least one switching contact 
(15), the contact bridge (13) being held in the first or 

second switch position by a bistable spring arrangement 
depending on the position of the plunger, an arm being 

assigned to the switching plunger (4) and part of the arm 
forming a holding-down device (10) which, in the first 

switch position of the contact bridge (13), is arranged 
at a small spacing from the contact bridge and, in the 

second switch position, projects into the path covered by 
the contact bridge, characterized in that the connection 

contacts (22, 23, 24) are arranged on that side of the 
housing (2) which is opposite to the switching plunger 

(4), in that the arm is arranged on the switching plunger 
(4) in the form of a cantilever arm (9) which is cantilevered 

at one end, and the holding-down device (10) is 
provided on the free end of the cantilever arm (9). 
Microswitch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the switching plunger (4) has an extension (11) 

on the side opposite to the cantilever arm (9), which  
 

extension acts on the contact bridge (13) parallel to the 
movement direction of the switching plunger (4). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the switching plunger (4) has two 

axial guides (5, 6), one of the guides (6) being arranged 
inside the housing (2), and in that the cantilever arm 

(9) is arranged between the two guides (5, 6). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the switching plunger (4) is 

arranged such that it is fixed against rotation. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that one of the guides (5) has an oval 

cross-section and is guided in a bearing which is likewise 
oval. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that that guide (6) of the switching 

plunger (4) which is fitted inside the housing has a T-shaped 
cross-section and engages into a bearing (7) which 

is likewise of T-shaped construction. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that, in the end position of the switching 

plunger (4), the holding-down device (10) presses the 
switching contact (15) against the fixed contact (24) 

which is in contact in the second switch position. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the switching plunger (4) and the 

cantilever arm (9) are designed in one piece. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the bistable spring arrangement has 

a pressure spring (14) which is connected to the contact 
bridge (13). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the pressure spring (14) and the 

contact bridge (13) are designed in one piece. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the contact bridge (13) is bent in 

the shape of a clasp and can be elastically deformed. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the cantilever arm (9) has a recess  

 
(12) into which the pressure spring (14) projects. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the free ends of the pressure 

spring (14) and of the contact bridge (13) engage with 
prestress into notches, which each point in opposite 

directions, within the housing (2), at least one of these 
notches being electrically conductively connected to a 

fixed contact (19). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the notches are arranged on the 

fixed contact (19). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the free ends of the pressure 

spring (14) and of the contact bridge (13) are supported 
with prestress in the vertices (17, 18) of the free end 

of the fixed contact (19), which free end is designed 
like a notch and as an S-shaped curve. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the contact bridge (13) has at
