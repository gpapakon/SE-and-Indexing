<ABSTRACT>
A charging device for charging a rotating 
photoconductor (2) contains a charging restriction device 

such as an LED (4) for exposing surfaces (2a) of the 
photoconductor (2) in a closing region (A) disposed in an 

upstream part of from the contacting point (B) of a charging 
roller (1) and the photoconductor (2) where the surfaces of 

the charging roller (1) and the photoconductor (2) are 
closing to each other. By the exposure of the LED (4), pair 

carriers are generated in the photoconductor, and the pair 
carriers cancel the electro-static charge on the surface 

(2a) of the photoconductor (2) in the closing region (A). 
Thus, the surface (2a) of the photoconductor (2) can be 

charged evenly in a downstream part (C) from the contacting 
point (B) where the gap between the surfaces of the charging 

roller (1) and the photoconductor (2) is very small.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charging device for
electrostatically charging objects which are to be charged,
and further relates to an image forming apparatus containing
the charging device. The charging device is especially
useful in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus.The electrophotographic image forming apparatus has,
in general, been used for a document copier, a laser beam
printer and so on. In such a conventional
electrophotographic apparatus, a corona discharger has been
broadly used for electrostatically charging a photoconductor
(photosensitive element) which is an object to be charged.
The corona discharger comprises a fine wire and a shielding
electrode. A high voltage, such as 4 to 5 kV, is applied to
the wire. Thus, the photoconductor is electrostatically
charged evenly by discharge between the wire and the
photoconductor. Furthermore, another corona discharger,
which has a grid disposed between the wire and the
photoconductor, is used for making the charge distribution
of the photoconductor more even. Such a corona discharger
is called Scorotron and widely used now. The Scorotron, however, needs an electric power
supply which can supply a high voltage of several kilovolts
for making the discharge stable. Furthermore, a lot of
ozone, which is injurious to the human body, is produced
during the discharge. Therefore, an ozone treatment
apparatus is necessary. Or, the photoconductor is
deteriorated by ozone.On the contrary, another method or apparatus has
been proposed for reducing ozone at a minimum. In the
method or apparatus, a conductive charging member contacts
the surface of the photoconductor. The discharge occurs
between the charging member and the surface of the
photoconductor, so that the photoconductor is directly
charged. The discharge is kept at a minimum which is
necessary for electrostatically charging the photoconductor.
As a result, the amount of ozone, which is produced during
the discharge, can be reduced.There are many examples of the apparatus for
directly charging the photoconductor by contacting the
surface thereof.
