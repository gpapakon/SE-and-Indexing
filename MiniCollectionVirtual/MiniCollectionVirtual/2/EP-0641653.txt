<ABSTRACT>
An infra-red dryer (10) for installation in a 
printing press (12) utilizes high velocity air jets (98) 

which scrub and break up the moist air layer which clings 
to the surface of a freshly printed and/or coated sheet 

(S). The high velocity air jets are directed through 
multiple air flow apertures (96) across an array (38) of 

infra-red lamps (60) onto the freshly printed and/or coated 
sheets. An extractor (40) exhausts the moisture-laden air 

from an exposure zone (74) while short wave length infrared 
radiation heats the ink and/or protective coating. The 

effective exposure to high velocity, hot air is increased 
by the air jets which produce a balanced pressure air 

blanket along the sheet travel path (P). The moist air 
layer is displaced from the printed and/or coated sheet (S) 

and is extracted from the press (12) as the sheet moves 
through the exposure zone (74).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related generally to accessories
for sheet-fed, rotary offset printing presses, and in
particular to a dryer for printed materials which utilizes
infra-red radiant heat, forced air flow and extraction.In the operation of a rotary offset press, an
image is reproduced on a sheet of paper or some other print
stock by a plate cylinder which carries the image, a
blanket cylinder which has an ink transfer surface for
receiving the inked image, and an impression cylinder which
presses the paper against the blanket cylinder so that the
inked image is transferred to the paper. In some applications,
a protective and/or decorative coating is applied to
the surface of the freshly printed sheets. The freshly
printed sheets are then conveyed to a sheet delivery
stacker in which the finally printed sheets are collected
and stacked.The wet ink and coatings should be dried before
the sheets are stacked or run back through the press for a
second pass, to prevent smearing defects and to prevent
offsetting of the ink on the unprinted side of the sheets
as they are stacked. Spray powder has been applied between
the freshly printed sheets which are to be stacked to
improve sheet handling and to separate one delivered sheet
from the next sheet to prevent offsetting while the ink
and/or coating dries. One limitation on the use of spray 
powder is that fugitive particles of the spray powder
disperse into the press room and collect on press equipment,
causing electrical and mechanical breakdowns and
imposing a potential health hazard for press room personnel.Hot air convection heaters and radiant heaters
have been employed to reduce the volume of spray powder
applied, except for the small amount needed for sheet
handling purposes. Hot air convection heaters are best
suited for slow to moderate speed press runs in which the
exposure time of each printed sheet to the hot air convection
flow is long enough that aqueous base inks and
coatings are set before the sheets reach the stacker.For high-speed press operation, for example, at
5,000 sheets per hour or more, the exposure time of each
printed sheet as it passes through the dryer station is not
sufficient to obtain good drying by convection flow alone.
Radiant heaters such as infra-red heat lamps provide
greater drying efficiency because the short wave length
infra-red energy is preferentially absorbed in the liquid
inks and coatings to provide rapid evaporation. The infrared
radiant energy releases water and volatiles from the
ink and/or coating. Consequently,
