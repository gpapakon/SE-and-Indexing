<CLAIMS>
Claims for the following Contracting States : CH, DE, FR, GB, LI, NL
Process for producing a plastic part that cannot be
colonised by germs and/or fungi, characterized in that

the plastic is pre-treated with a swelling agent and
that the obtained swollen plastic is treated with a

solution of a water-insoluble compound containing a
bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal with the exception

of auranofin.
Process of claim 1, wherein the compound containing a
bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal is an inorganic

metal salt.
Process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the bactericidal
and/or fungicidal metal is silver, copper, gold, zinc

or cerium.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the solvent for the compound containing a

bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal can complex the
metal and that auranofin may be used.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the swollen plastic is treated with a solution of

a compound containing a bactericidal and/or fungicidal
metal without being dried first, and wherein the

compound containing a bactericidal and/or fungicidal
metal is not as readily soluble in the swelling agent

for the plastic as in the solvent in which it is
dissolved and wherein auranofin may be used. 
Process of any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the swelling agent is acetone or ethanol and that

auranofin may be used.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the solvent contains an organic amine or ammonia

and that auranofin may be used.
Process of claim 7, characterized in that the organic
amine is an alkanol amine.
Process of claim 8, characterized in that the alkanol
amine is ethanol amine.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in
that the compound containing a bactericidal and/or

fungicidal metal is silver chloride and the solvent for
this compound is ethanol amine.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 4 and 7 to 10,
characterized in that the plastic part contains

polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, silicone,
alone or in combination.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 4 and 7 to 10,
characterized in that the plastic part is a preproduct

for medical devices.
Process of any one of claims 5 and 6, characterized in
that the plastic part contains polyethlyene,

polypropylene, polyurethane, silicone, alone or in
combination.
Process of any one of claims 5 and 6, characterized in
that the plastic part is a preproduct for medical

devices. 
Plastic part that cannot be colonised by germs and is
obtained in a process of any one of claims 1 to 4 and 7

to 12.
Claims for the following Contracting State : AT
Process for producing a plastic part that cannot be
colonised by germs and/or fungi, characterized in that

the plastic is pre-treated with a swelling agent and
that the obtained swollen plastic is treated with a

solution of a water-insoluble compound containing a
bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal.
Process of claim 1, wherein the compound containing a
bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal is an inorganic

metal salt.
Process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the bactericidal
and/or fungicidal metal is silver, copper, gold, zinc

or cerium.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the solvent for the compound containing a

bactericidal and/or fungicidal metal can complex the
metal.
Process, particularly of any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the swollen plastic is treated

with a solution of a compound containing a bactericidal
and/or fungicidal metal without being dried first, and

wherein the compound containing a bactericidal and/or
fungicidal metal is not as readily soluble in the

swelling agent for the plastic as in the solvent in
which it is dissolved.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the swelling agent is acetone or ethanol. 
Process of any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the solvent contains an organic amine or ammonia.
Process of claim 7, characterized in that the organic
amine is an alkanol amine.
Process of claim 8, characterized in that the alkanol
amine is ethanol amine.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in
that the compound containing a bactericidal and/or

fungicidal metal is silver chloride and the solvent for
this compound is ethanol amine.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in
that the plastic part contains polyethylene,

polypropylene, polyurethane, silicone, alone or in
combination.
Process of any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in
that the plastic part is a preproduct for medical

devices.
Plastic part that cannot be colonised by germs and is
obtained in a process of any one of claims 1 to 12.
