<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rock-breaking apparatus of the type employing a striker pin
adapted for limited axial movement within a nose block assembly upon impact from a
hammer means.This rock-breaking apparatus is described in Australian Patent No. 585274.This type of apparatus commonly involves large force and shock transmissions from a
hammer to a striker pin as a means of breaking rocks. The forces involved in such an
action can place high stresses on the entire apparatus including the machinery
supporting same.In order to minimise the damage such forces can cause to the apparatus, modifications
have been proposed with a view to absorb structurally damaging shock as it occurs in
this type of apparatus.Australian Patent No. 585274 discloses rock-breaking apparatus which includes a guide
column within which a weight falls under gravity to strike a tool. A piece of shock-absorbing
material is located at or near the base of said column such that it enables force
to be transmitted from said weight to the tool, while minimising the effect of the impact
of said weight on other parts of the apparatus.This arrangement reduces the effect of the impact of the weight on the apparatus.
However rock-breaking apparatus of the type disclosed in Australian Patent No.
585274 is often used to break very hard types of rock. Often, this means that several
blows will be required to cause a single fracture in the rock. On each occasion where
the rock does not break, there occurs a recoil through the tool to the apparatus, causing
stress in the entire apparatus and in the carrier for the apparatus. This recoil caused by
the inability to fracture a rock is termed in the trade as an "ineffective hit". As can be
appreciated the force of a recoil is considerable as there is little resilience in rock and
therefore most of the kinetic energy imparted by the falling hammer to the striker pin
will be reconvened to impart an upward motion to the striker pin and also to the
housing which retains it. On occasion, there may be what is called a "mishit" this occurs when there is no rock
beneath the striker pin. Thus, the kinetic energy imparted from the hammer to the
striker pin cannot be further imparted to the rock below. As the motion of the striker
pin is halted by the rock-breaking apparatus it must therefore absorb nearly all of the
kinetic energy. Again this place considerable stress on the apparatus.Australian Patent Specification AUB27994/77 discloses a shock absorber which
operates on the exterior of the guide column of the

<CLAIMS>
A nose assembly for a rock breaking apparatus having

i) a retainer (21) supporting a striker pin (20) within a nose block housing (15),
ii) said retainer (21) being located adjacent to a primary (22) and secondary (23)
shock absorbing means of said nose block housing (15),
iii) said striker pin (20) having opposed recesses (24) and striker pin retaining
means,
iv) the striker pin retainer (21) being adapted to receive said recesses (24) to retain
said striker pin (20) with limited movement relative thereto,
v) wherein at the limit of striker pin (20) extension further movement thereof is
taken up by the said retainer (21) and transmitted to said shock absorbing means (22,

23),
vi) said housing fully (15) encloses the retainer (21) and shock absorbing means
(22, 23), and
vii) said retainer (21) is sandwiched between the shock absorbing means (22, 23)
within the housing (15).
A nose assembly for a rock breaking apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the housing (15) has inner and outer pin passages (16, 17) and the shock absorbing

means (22, 23) are positioned within the said housing (15) to absorb mishit shock loads;
the assembly further comprises a striker pin chamber (19) accommodating the striker

pin (20) and retainer (21);

said striker pin (20) being restrained by said retainer (21) between extended and
withdrawn positions when struck by a hammer to penetrate an object and being slidable

with respect to said pin passages;
an inner end of the striker pin (20) extending into a hammer chamber to which the nose
assembly is fixed whilst the other end of the striker pin extends outside the striker pin

chamber (19).
A nose assembly according to any preceding claim, wherein the shock absorbing
means (22, 23) are positioned within the housing (15) on opposite sides of the retainer

(21) to absorb on one side of retainer, mishit and ineffective hit shock loads.
