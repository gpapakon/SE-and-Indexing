<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for
catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides using a hydrocarbon
and/or an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing
agent. More particularly, it relates to a catalyst for
catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides which is suitable for
reduction and removal of harmful nitrogen oxides contained in
emissions from factories, automobiles, etc.Nitrogen oxides present in exhaust or emissions have
been removed by, for example, a method in which the nitrogen
oxides is further oxidized and then absorbed in an alkali or
a method comprising reducing it to nitrogen by using ammonia,
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, etc. as a reducing
agent.These conventional methods have their own
disadvantages. That is, the former method requires a means
for handling the alkaline waste liquid to prevent
environmental pollution. Of the latter method, the method of
using ammonia as a reducing agent involves the problem that
ammonia reacts with sulfur oxides in the emissions to form
salts, resulting in a reduction in catalyst activity. When
in using hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or a hydrocarbon as a
reducing agent, the reducing agent preferentially undergoes 
reaction with oxygen because oxygen is present in a higher
concentration than nitrogen oxide in emission. This means
that substantial reduction of nitrogen oxides requires a
large quantity of the reducing agent.It has recently been proposed to catalytically
decomposing nitrogen oxides in the absence of a reducing
agent. However, known catalysts for direct decomposition of
nitrogen oxides have not yet been put to practical use'due to
their low decomposing activity.On the other hand, H type zeolite, Cu ion-exchanged
ZSM-5, etc. have also been proposed as a catalyst for
catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides using a hydrocarbon or
an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing agent.
In particular, H type ZSM-5 (SiO2/Aâ„“2O3 molar ratio = 30 to
40) are regarded optimal. However, even the H type ZSM-5 is
not deemed to have sufficient reducing activity. In
particular, when the emissions have some water content, the
zeolite structure is dealuminated, showing a sudden drop in
its performance. It has thus been demanded to develop a
catalyst for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides which
exhibits higher reduction activity and shows a high
durability even if the emissions have some water content.EP-A-0459396 discloses a process for removing nitrogen oxides
from exhaust gases using a catalyst which may be a proton-type
zeolite or
