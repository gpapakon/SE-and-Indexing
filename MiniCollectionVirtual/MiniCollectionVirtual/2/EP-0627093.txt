<ABSTRACT>
The device of the invention comprises a laser source (1), a collimator (14), a liquid crystal cell spatial modulator (7), a collecting lens (8) and an afocal zoom objective (10) projecting variable magnification moving images on a screen (11). The device is chiefly for use in an air warfare simulator.

<CLAIMS>
Device for projecting narrow optical field moving
images, including a point light source (5, 14A) arranged

at the focus of a collimating optic (6, 16, 18) followed
by a device (7, 19) for spatial modulation of the

collimated beam including a matrix-addressed liquid
crystal cell, by a convergent optic (8) for divergent

beam formation, and by a projection optic situated beyond
the focus (9) of the convergent optic for divergent beam

formation so as to project its exit beam onto a
projection screen (11), the entrance face of the

projection optic being arranged at a place where the
diameter of the beam from the focus of the convergent

optic is almost equal to that of this entrance face,
characterized in that the projection optic is an afocal

zoom (10).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the light source includes a laser (1, 17).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that a beam-transport optical fibre (4) is arranged

between the laser (1) and the focus of the collimating
optic.
Device according to one of the preceding claims
for the projection of colour images, characterized in

that the spatial modulation device (19) includes a device
(22, 25) separating the chromatic components of a non-monochrome

light beam, a spatial modulating device (28,
30, 32) in respect of each of these components and a

mixer device (29). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the device for separating components includes at

least one dichroic mirror, and in that the mixer device
is a dichroic prism.
