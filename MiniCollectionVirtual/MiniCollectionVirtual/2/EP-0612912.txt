<ABSTRACT>
In an earth drilling device with a drill head (14) which is rotatable about its axis (16) and has for its directional control a control surface (18) inclined relative to the axis (16) and on which at least one nozzle (20) for the discharge of a pressurised drilling fluid is provided, the nozzle opening being arranged on the axially parallel side of the drill head (14) remote from the control surface (18), the axial distance of the nozzle from the tip of the drill head and its jet direction are selected in such a way that, when the drill head is being used, the jet discharging from the nozzle essentially reaches only the earth located at the side of the drill head.

An earth boring device with a cylindrical boring head 
(14) rotatable about its axis (16), which boring head for 

the control of its direction has a control surface (18) 
inclined to the cylinder axis (16) at its front end and 

at least one jet (20) for the discharge of a pressurized 
boring fluid, with the jet opening being arranged on a 

side of the boring head (14) parallel to the axis and 
facing away from the control surface (18), and the axial 

spacing of the jet (20) from the tip of the boring head 
and its stream direction being so chosen that in use of 

the boring head (14) the stream flowing from the jet (20) 
reaches essentially only the region of earth lying to the 

side of the boring head (14). 
An earth boring device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the jet (20) is directed essentially perpendicularly 
to the boring head axis (16). 
An earth boring device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the jet (20) is directed at an angle to the 

boring head axis (16) in the direction forwardly of the 
boring head (14). 
An earth boring device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the jet (20) is directed essentially parallel 

to the control surface (18). 
An earth boring device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized
 in that a plurality of jets (20) is provided.  
 
An earth boring device according to claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that the jets are arranged in a row essentially 

parallel to the axis of the boring head. 
An earth boring device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized
 in that it is made for a static forward 
drive of the boring head (14). 
An earth boring device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized
 in that it is made for a dynamic percussion 
ram boring device.
