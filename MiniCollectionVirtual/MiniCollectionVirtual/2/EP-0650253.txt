<ABSTRACT>
A speed estimation observer for a motor control system 
outputs a motor speed estimate

. The speed estimation 
observer includes a time lag 

correction value calculating block for implementing a correction 
of a model output speed estimate. Therefore, the accuracy and 

stability of the speed estimation are improved, and the control 
system keeps the stability in a speed range of low to high speed 

and ensures the disturbance suppressing effect in a high speed 
range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in a speed
estimation observer apparatus for a motor speed controlling system
using a rotary encoder and operated in an extremely low speed
range.Generally, in a speed control system for controlling a speed
of a motor by using a rotary encoder of a relatively low
resolution, when the motor is rotated in an extremely low speed,
an encoder pulse interval becomes longer than a speed control
period, and therefore accurate speed information cannot be
obtained during such a speed control period. Such a relationship
between the speed control period and encoder pulse is shown in
Fig. 9. In Fig. 9, Ts is a speed control period, Tp is a period of a
pulse encoder, and Td is a difference between Ts and Tp.
Accordingly, when the encoder pulse is inputted, an average
value of a speed is derived by using a pulse period Tp from the
following equation:
nM = 60/pp·1/ Tp
where pp is the number of pulses per rotation of the encoder
[P/R], Tp is an encoder pulse period [sec], and nM is an average
value of the rotation speed of the motor [rpm].As is clear from the above equation, in an extremely low
speed range, that is, when the encoder pulse period becomes
extremely large, the average speed becomes indefinite.
Accordingly, the speed control system tends to be unstable, and
responsibility thereof is degraded. In order to solve such
difficulties, there is proposed a control system in which a speed
during an interval between adjacent encoder pulses is estimated
by using a speed estimation observer apparatus. Such a control system is
shown in Fig. 11. A speed estimation observer apparatus 10 applied to the 
control system is shown in Fig. 10 and includes a load torque
observer means of a minimum dimension. As shown in Fig. 10, a
deviating means 110 receives a torque command τM*(i) and a load
torque estimate , and outputs a deviation output
therebetween. The deviation output is supplied to a first
calculating means 120. The first calculating means 120 includes a
division means 120a in which the speed control period Ts is
divided by a model machine time constant TM*, an integrator
120c, and an adder 120b which adds an output of the division
block 120a to an output of the integrator 120c. The model output
speed estimate  derived in the first calculating means 120 is
supplied to a second caculating means 130. The second
calculating means 130 derives an average value during pulse
interval and outputs the calculated result  to a plus input
end of a first deviating means 140. A minus
