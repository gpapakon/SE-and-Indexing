<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the assembly of a roller-shutter box and frame via coupling elements (21) which are fitted on the upper frame leg (111) and are positively connected to the baseboard (311) of the roller-shutter box. As an improved solution, in conjunction with this assembly, it is proposed to provide, on the upper frame leg (111), spaced-apart coupling elements (21) with a front overhang (211) beyond the frame leg beneath which, when the roller-shutter box is fitted on the frame, there engages a claw (312) formed on the front of the baseboard (311) of the roller-shutter box, the stabilisation of the assembly of the roller-shutter box and the frame taking place by an additionally positively locking connection (213, 314) between the baseboard (311) of the roller-shutter box and the rear region of the coupling elements (21) fitted on the upper frame leg (111).

Assembly of a roller shutter box, which is
mountable on a window frame, with the window frame via an

adapter connection having an adapter projection (211),
which protrudes beyond the front side of the upper frame

portion (111), and a socket (315), which is provided in the
top panel (311) of the roller shutter box in the region of

the adapter abutment, a rib (316) forming a receiver (314)
and protruding into said socket from its rear side in the

direction of the front side, into which receiver the rear
adapter region (213) is inserted when the roller shutter

box is in the mounted state on the window frame, and said
assembly having a catch (312), which is provided thereon

and engages in a form-locking manner with the front
adapter projection (211) when the roller shutter box is in

the mounted state on the window frame, characterised by
flat adapter blanks (21), which sit on the upper window

frame portion (111) at spacings from one another, for the
connection of the adapter to a projection (211) protruding

beyond the front side of the window frame portion (111),
and characterised by a resiliently openable catch (312),

which engages beneath the front adapter projection (211) of
the flat adapter blanks (21) when the roller shutter box is

in the mounted state on the window frame and abuts against
the front side of the upper window frame portion (111).
Assembly according to claim 1, characterised by
adapter blanks (21), which are inserted into sockets in the

upper window frame portion (111) with appropriately
configured projection members.
Assembly according to claim 1, characterised by a
screw connection between the upper window frame portion

(111) and the adapter blanks (21). 
Assembly according to claim 1, characterised by an
adhesive connection between the upper window frame portion

(111) and the adapter blanks (21).
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised by resilient characteristics of the catch

(312) caused by a weakening of the profile of the roller
shutter box top panel (311) in the catch region.
Assembly according to claim 5, characterised by a
multi-layered configuration of the catch (312, 312').
Assembly according to claim 6, characterised in
that the layers of the catch (312, 312') are spaced apart.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised by an external surface of the catch (312)

formed as a rolling edge.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the projection (211) of the adapter

blanks (21), mounted on the frame portion (111), protrudes
beyond the front side of the window frame portion (111) and

is undercut.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the front projection (211) of the

adapter blanks (21) passes over the window frame profile
into a portion (216), which abuts against the front side of

the upper window frame portion (111) and is engaged from
below by the appropriately designed catch (312), which is

moulded on the top panel (311) of the roller shutter box
mounted on the window frame.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that a stop member (214) extends at the

front projection of the adapter blanks (21) via the window 
frame profile, said stop member being orientated towards

the side remote from the window frame and providing a
receiver for a rib (317), which protrudes into the catch

(312) moulded on the top panel (311') of the roller shutter
box.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised by a region of the frame portion which is

covered, over less than half of the surface of the upper
window frame portion (111), by the adapter blanks (21)

mounted thereon with spacings between one another.
Assembly according to claim 12, characterised by a
region of the frame portion which is covered, over a

maximum of one-third of the surface of the upper window
frame portion (111), by the adapter blanks (21) mounted

thereon with spacings between one another.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 13,
characterised by external adapter blanks (21) mounted on

the upper window frame portion at a spacing from the
portion end.
Assembly according to one of claims 1 to 14,
characterised by a clamp fitting between the receiver
