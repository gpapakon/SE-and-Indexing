<ABSTRACT>
Snap-on bead assemblies for providing blocking walls for the attachment of connectors, and more particularly quick connectors, are disclosed as comprising an open-ended ring member having an outer surface, an inner surface and two extending flanges. The ring members are formed of a resilient material, such as high gauge steel, which allows the ring members to be expanded and positioned over a tubular conduit. In a first embodiment, the flanges (16a) and (16b) project downwardly and embed within depressions (34) formed upon outer surface (32) of the conduit (30) to lock the ring member (10) onto the conduit. In the second enbodiment, the flanges (116a) and (116b) project upwardly and the inner surface (114) of the ring member (116) is positioned within a depression (134) formed on the surface (132) of the conduit (130) which locks the ring member (110) onto the conduit (130).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bead assemblies, and more particularly, to bead
assemblies which are attachable to tubular conduits and which provide the conduits with
blocking walls for abutment by connector assemblies.In the automotive industry, as well as for many other industries, the need always
exist for low cost, reliable and easy to assembly components. This need is especially true
with respect to connector assemblies which detachably adjoin fluid conveying conduits,
such as fuel or refrigerant lines. Presently, many connector assemblies, and more
particularly, many quick connector assemblies are manufactured such that a male conduit
is provided with an outwardly projecting bead for abutment by retainer means contained
within a female housing. The connection between fluid conveying conduits is generally
made by inserting the male conduit into the female housing until the snap connection
occurs thereby locking the male conduit within the female housing. Many times, however,
tubular conduits already placed in use are not provided with this upwardly projecting bead
member. Standard beadless conduits must, therefore, be provided with a bead member
before they can be utilized with many connector assemblies. The embodiments of the
present invention fulfill this need by providing apparatuses which are attachable to
standard tubular conduits thereby converting the standard conduit to a form which can be
utilized with connector assemblies and, more particularly, with quick connector assemblies.Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a standard
conduit with an attachable bead member thereby adapting the conduit into one that can
be utilized with a connector assembly and, particularly, with a quick connector assembly.It is another object of the present invention to provide an attachable bead
assembly which can be attached to a tubular conduit quickly and easily.It is yet another object of the present invention to provide attachable bead
assemblies which can be used on tubular conduits which are resistant to welding and
gluing.It is also an object of the present invention to provide bead assemblies which are
producible at a low cost. US-A-2 741 497, upon which the preamble of claim 8 is
based, discloses a compression locking coupling for
engagement with a section of pipe having an external
circumferential groove formed therein. The coupling
includes a split snap ring which is, in use, snapped into
the annular groove to be seated therein. The inside
diameter of the snap ring is in

<CLAIMS>
An attachable bead assembly for deformable
tubular conduits, comprising:


a deformable ring member (10,110) having a first end
(18,118) and a second end (20,120), an inner surface

(14,112) and an outer surface (12,114) and at least one
projecting flange (16a,16b,116a,116b), wherein said at

least one flange includes an edge (22);
whereby said ring member (10,110) is deformed to
attach to a deformable tubular conduit (30,130) having a

desired outer diameter (32,132) to facilitate connection of
the tubular conduit within a connector housing (40) and

said ring member after assembly on said tubular conduit
returning to its undeformed inner diameter (26) such that

said inner diameter is less than said tubular conduit outer
diameter (32,132) such that said ring member deforms said

tubular conduit decreasing the tubular conduit diameter at
said ring to attach said ring member to said tubular

conduit.
The attachable bead assembly of claim 1,
wherein said at least one flange (16a,16b) projects

downwardly.
The attachable bead assembly of claim 2,
wherein said edge (22) of said at least one flange

(16a,16b) is positioned within an annular groove (34)
provided on said tubular conduit (30) thereby precluding

lateral movement of said ring member along said tubular 
conduit.
The attachable bead assembly of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said edge (22) of said at least

one flange (16a) is rounded.
The attachable bead assembly of claim 1,
wherein said at least one flange (116a,116b) projects

upwardly.
The attachable bead assembly of claim 5,
wherein said inner surface of said ring member (112) is

positioned upon said tubular conduit (130) within an
annular groove (134), thereby precluding lateral movement

of said ring member along said tubular conduit.
The bead assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said ring member (10,110) is made of a

resilient metal.
A method of attaching a bead assembly to a
tubular conduit, the method comprising the step of:


(a) providing a selectively deformable ring
member (10,110) having a first end (18,118) and a second

end (20,120), an inner surface (14,112) and an outer
surface (12,114) and at least one projecting flange

(16a,16b,116a,116b) said ring member having a desired inner
diameter (26) in an undeformed condition;

   characterised in that the method further
comprises the steps of:


(b) providing a deformable tubular conduit
(30,130) formed from a plastic; 
(c) expanding said ring member (10,110) such
that the ring's inner diameter (26) increases to a size

greater than the tubular conduit's outer diameter (32,132)
by inserting a tool between said first and second ends

(18,118,20,120);
(d) positioning said ring member (10,110) over
said tubular conduit (30,130); and
(e) removing said tool from between said first
and second ends,

   whereby removing said tool from between said
first and second ends allows said ring member to spring

back to its original position and be embedded within the
outer diameter of said tubular conduit and said ring member

after assembly on said tubular conduit returning to its
undeformed inner diameter such that said inner diameter is

less than said tubular conduit outer diameter to attach
said ring member to said tubular conduit.

one flange (16a,16b) extends downwardly toward said tubular

conduit (30).
The method of claim 9, wherein said at least
one flange (16a,16b) becomes embedded within the outer

diameter of said tubular conduit to form an annular groove
and thereby preclude lateral movement of said ring member

along said conduit.
The method of claim 8, wherein said at least
one flange (16a,116b) extends upwardly away from said 

tubular conduit.
The method of claim 11, wherein the inner
surface of said ring member (110) becomes embedded within

the outer diameter of said tubular conduit (130) thereby
forming an annular groove and precluding lateral movement
