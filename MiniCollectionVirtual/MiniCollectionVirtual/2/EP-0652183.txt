<ABSTRACT>
Plant for treating waste waters (effluents) containing organic and inorganic matter, having a microbiological treatment stage (8, 10, 12) which has at least one unit (9-11) which contains media on the surface of which bacteria can multiply and accumulate and which are designed and arranged in such a manner that the waste water can wash round them, the media being able to release the bacteria to the waste water in a controlled manner, and process for treating waste waters containing organic and inorganic matter in particular using such a plant in which, in the microbiological treatment stage, at least some of the waste water washes round the said media colonised by bacteria, bacteria being detached from the media and being brought into the waste water flushing round the media, the multiplication and accumulation of the bacteria of the said media being carried out in a preceding microbiological treatment of a waste water mixture in such a manner that the accumulated bacteria are adapted to the said waste water to be processed.

<CLAIMS>
Installation for working up waste water containing organic and inorganic subject with a
microbiological treatment stage, which the waste water is flowing through and which has

at least one aggregate, which contains mediums on their surface bacteria can multiply and
accumulate, while the mediums can deliver the bacteria controlled to the waste water,

which is characterized by the way, that the installation serves to work up the waste water
charged and that at least one microbiological reactor with one flowing in and one flowing

off for the waste water is previewed, which can be ventilated if it need be and to which
the named aggregate is coupled with a separat junction, which is preferably composed of

an annular conduction, which can conduct the waste water from the reactor to the
aggregate and the other way, while the mediuns are rinsed round.
Installation according to claim 1, which is characterized by the way, that mediums
contain organic and/or inorganic materials, preferably found in the natur.
Installation according to claim 2, which is characterized by the way, that the mediums are
composed by latticed bodies formed by irregular soft wood-poles with cotton and/or

pumice-stone filled hollow bodies or with plastic material like Polyethylen or
Polypropylen, while the latters are fixed on wood sticks.
Installation according to one of the claims 1 until 3, which is characterized by the way,
that in the microbiological treatment stage two reactors are previewed, while each of

them is connected with one of the named aggregates, while one of them is ventilated and
the flowing off of one reactor is connected with the flowing in of the other one and the

other way and besides exists one flowing in to the microbiological treatment stage and
one flowing off out of it and that if it need be a third unventilated reactor is previewed,

which is able to be coupled into the junction-main between the unventilated and the
ventilated reactor, to which none of the named aggregates is accorded and in which the

named flowing off is integrated.
Installation according to one of the claims 1 until 4, which is characterized by the way,
that to the microbiological treatment stage a mechanical and a chemical treatment stage

and if it need be a sterilizing installation and/or a microbiological pre-treatment stage are
precontrolled and a chemical post-treatment stage is postcontrolled.
Installation according to one of the claims 1 until 5, which is characterized by the way,
that pumps are previewed to circulate the waste water between the named aggregate and

its belonging to reactor and/or between the reactors.
Procedure to work up waste water containing organic and inorganic material and flowing
through a miocrobiological treatment stage especially by using an installation according 

to one or more claims 1 until 6, which is characterized by the way, that the waste water is
charged treated, that in the microbiological treatment stage, where the worked up waste

water is flowing, one branched off part of the waste water stream rinses round the
mediums, on which surface bacteria is growing up by multiplying and accumulating and

that there - if it need be by using of mechanical energie - bacteria are controlled detached
of the mediums and brought into the rinsing round waste water, while the multiplying and

accumulating of the bacteria on the named mediums by the preceding treatment or the
preceding treatments of the waste water charges is executed, which are essentially

identically composed than the purified waste water, so that the growing up bacteria is
adapted to the worked up waste water.
Procedure according to claim 7, which is characterized by the way, that the waste water is
circulated between one ventilated and at least one unventilated reactor, while the

circulation happens preferably cadenced, while respectively with one part of the waste
water the named mediums are rinsed round in the according aggregates
Procedure according to claim 7 or 8, characterized by the way, that the bacteria while
growing up are essentially submitted to the same treatment conditions than the named

worked up waste water.
Procedure according to one of the claims 7 until 9, which is characterized by the way, that
for the first growing up of the bacteria on the mediums first an aqueous, organic and if it

need be inorganic preferably poor in nitrogen material containing nutrive liquid together
with a mixture, which contains bacteria which are able to reduce the organic and partly

the inorganic material in the named to be reduced waste water is brought into the
microbiological treatment stage, that this liquid is essentially submitted to the same -

however adapted to the different start conditions - microbiological treatment conditions
than the named worked up waste water, and that alter the reduce of the material has

begun a taste of this waste water is mixed up to the nutrive liquid taste, which is
essentially composed the same way than the named worked up waste water and which is

changed on the furthr sequel of the growing up of the bacteria in a fixed way in direction
of an increasing part of the named mixed up waste water, while in difference to the

condition of the microbiological treatment while the growing up of the bacteria preferably
for fixed periods the pH-value is increased above the fixed value for the microbiological

treatment and that subsequently the mediums are only exposed to waste water charges,
which are essentially composed the same way than the worked up waste water.
Procedure according to one of the claims 7 until 10, which is characterized by the way,
that the waste water is conducted along quartz bodies, which are present at least in one of

the aggregates.
Procedure according to one of the claims 7 until 11, which is characterized by the way,
that alter the microbiological treatment, only one part of the treated waste water and the

resulting mud is removed out of the microbiological treatment stage, subsequently the
becoming free vo
lume is filled up with the not yet worked up waste water and then the
microbiological treatment is practiced again. 
Procedure according to claim 12, which is characterized by the way, that perhaps 2,5 until
perhaps 30 vol% of the waste water and the resulting mud are removed.

physical-chemical drawn combinations are removed out of the waste water, that the waste

combinations are removed, while for the physical-chemical drawing preferably flocky

Procedure according to one of the claims 7 until 15, which is characterized by the way,
that for the regulation of the microbiological reactions the temperatures and if it need be

the mud quantity is varied in the worked up waste water.
