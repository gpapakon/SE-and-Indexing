<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a resinous copolymer 
containing at least one monomer compound from each of the 
groups of phenol compounds (I) and olefinically 
unsaturated non-acidic terpene compounds (II). Resinous copolymers of this type, so-called 
terpene-phenolic resins, are disclosed by SU-A-1073249. 
Said terpene-phenolic resins are used, inter alia, in 
printing inks, coatings and glues. A drawback of said terpene-phenolic resins is 
that they often have a relatively low melting point. The 
melting temperature is strongly dependent on the type of 
terpene compounds that is used. A further drawback is that 
terpene-phenolic resins are relatively insensitive to 
modification reactions. Owing to these drawbacks, terpene-phenolic 
resins are not very suitable for use in printing 
inks, for which a high melting point is desirable, 
particularly for rapid drying of the ink. In this 
application modifiability is desirable for adapting 
certain properties of the resinous copolymer to the 
desired properties of the printing ink such as, for 
example, the solution viscosity, the solubility and the 
pigment-wetting properties. The object of the invention is to provide a 
resinous copolymer which has a higher melting point and a 
better modifiability than the known terpene-phenolic 
resins. This object is achieved according to the 
invention in that the copolymer also contains at least one 
monomer compound from the group of polyunsaturated olefin 
compounds (III), the monomer compounds III forming from 1 
to 70% by weight of the total of the monomer compounds II 
and III, and the monomer compounds II and III forming at 
least 50% by weight of the total of the monomer compound 
I, II and III. Surprisingly, it has been found that the 
resinous copolymers according to the invention have higher  
 
melting points than the known terpene-phenolic resins (the 
term melting point here and hereinafter refers to the 
"ring and ball" softening point according to ASTM E28). It 
is surprising that a resinous copolymer which comprises 
monomer compound III in addition to monomer compounds I 
and II has a higher melting point than a - otherwise 
similar - resinous copolymer not containing any monomer 
compounds III, because it is known, for example from JA-4735000, 
that resinous copolymers which consist of monomer 
compounds I and III have an even much lower melting point 
than the above-mentioned terpene-phenolic resins 
consisting of monomer compounds I and II. A further advantage of the resinous copolymers 
according to
