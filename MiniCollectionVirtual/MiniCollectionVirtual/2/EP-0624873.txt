<ABSTRACT>
A device automatically blocks the insertion of a cassette (1) into a loading device (10), and does so right from the start of an insertion movement if the cassette is not correctly presented by the user. It comprises at least one mobile element (20, 22) furnished with at least one stop member (24, 30) blocking the insertion of a cassette (1) which is poorly presented but allowing the said insertion of a cassette (1) correctly presented after lateral displacement of the mobile element (20, 22) by virtue of an inclined surface (26) with which a rounded corner (5, 7) of the cassette (1) cooperates. A stop member (24, 30) consists of a lug (30) which can be displaced in a vertical plane, the other member (24, 30) consisting of a tab (24) cooperating with a groove (6a, 6b) provided in a lateral face (4a, 4b) of the said cassette (1).

Loading device (10) for cassettes (1) having a
housing (14) for recei
ving said cassette, bearing at
least one mobile element (20, 22) movable laterally

with respect to the housing (14) and having an
inclined surface (26) cooperating with the front edge

of a cassette (1) inserted in the housing, the
inclined surface (26) being arranged laterally and in

the vicinity of the insertion face of the housing
(14), characterized in that the mobile element (20,

22) is associated with at least one mobile leg (30)
impeding the insertion of a non-properly oriented

cassette (1) and movable in a plane perpendicular to
the shifting plane of the mobile element (20, 22) so

as to permit loading of a cassette (1) through the
insertion face of the housing (14) only when the

inclined surface (26) has been displaced laterally by
a properly oriented cassette (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the leg (30) comprises an inclined edge (36)

cooperating with the side of an opening (15, 16) made
in the housing (14) and through which runs the leg

(30) so that, upon lateral displacement of the mobile
element (20, 22), the inclined edge (36) cooperating

with the side of the opening (15, 16) displaces the
leg (30) in a plane perpendicular to the shifting

plane of the mobile element (20, 22).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the leg (30) includes a tongue (38) cooperating

with the periphery of the opening (15, 16) to prevent
any displacement of the leg (30) as long as the

surface (26) of the mobile element (20, 22) has not
been displaced laterally.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the housing (14) has, in the vicinity of the

opening (15, 16), a bend (50) cooperating with the 
leg (30) to prevent any displacement of the leg (30)

as long as the mobile element (20, 22) has not been
displaced laterally.
Device according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the surface (26) is

inclined in the direction of insertion of the cassette
(1) in the housing (14) for being displaced laterally

by a corner of the cassette (1) in the plane of
insertion of the cassette while the leg (30) moves in

a plane perpendicular to it.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the leg (30) is linked to the mobile element (20,

22) through a flexible tongue (28).
Device according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the mobile element (20,

22) bears, in the vicinity of the inclined surface
(26), a tongue (24) cooperating with a groove (6)

normally located in the lateral edge (4a, 4b) of a
cassette (1).
Device according to claim 7, characterized in
that the tongue (24) serves as a blocking element when

the cassette (1) is not inserted with the proper
orientation.
Device according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it includes two similar

mobile elements (20, 22), arranged symmetrically on
each side of the housing (14) in the direction of

insertion of a cassette (1).
Device according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the dimensions of the

blocking tongue (24) and the leg (30) as their spacing
with respect to the insertion face of the housing (14)

prevents any insertion of a cassette inserted with its
small edge first when the proper orientation for

insertion is along the large edge for cassettes of
rectangular shape.
