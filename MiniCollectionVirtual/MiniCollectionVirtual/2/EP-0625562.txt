<ABSTRACT>
Solids (esp. residue) gasification process involves (partially) gasifying the solids in a shaft with controlled sub-stoichiometric supply of fresh air and feeding the incompletely gasified solids and gases via one or more narrow points of the shaft to a chamber in which the solids are post-gasified and from which the gases are withdrawn, a bed being formed from which ash is discharged.

Method of gasifying solids, especially residual matter, with which the solids
are filled into a shaft (1), gasified at least partly with a controlled,

substoichiometric supply of fresh air (18, 20), and the solid proportions not
yet fully gasified and gases are fed through at least one bottleneck (17, 19)

in the shaft into a chamber (25) in which the solid proportions are
regasified and from which gases are withdrawn (27), a bed (29, 29a, 29b)

being formed from which ash (57) is withdrawn,

characterized in that into the bed (29, 29a, 29b) an inert, fluidizable
material (31) as well as a fluidizing and reaction gas (45, 45a, 45b) in a

quantity sufficient to create a fluidized bed is introduced.
Method as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that the fluidized bed is formed in the shaft (Fig. 1).
Method as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that the fluidized bed is formed below the shaft (Fig. 5) or
beside the shaft (Fig. 7).
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the height of the fluidized bed is controlled in
response to a predetermined pressure difference above and below the

fluidized bed.
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that as the fluidizing and reaction gas a mixture of air or
oxygen and flue gas of the combustion process is used.
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the temperature in the fluidized bed is kept at a
predetermined value, preferably at about 850Â°C, by controlling the quantity

of the fluidizing and reaction gas or the oxygen content thereof. 
Method as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6,

characterized in that the fluidized bed is divided into a first fluidized bed
portion (29a) at the bottom of the shaft (1) and a second fluidized bed

portion (29b) beside the shaft, and the resulting gases are passed across
the fluidized layers of both fluidized bed portions (29a, 29b) and withdrawn

as a cocurrent from a gas outlet (71, 71a) above the second fluidized bed
portion.
Gasification reactor with a shaft (1) to receive a fill of solids (7) for at least
partial gasification thereof, with at least one support (9) for the fill of solids

(7) defining at least one bottleneck (17, 19) for the passage of solids and
gases, with fresh air conduits (18, 20) which open into the area above the

bottleneck to introduce a controlled, substoichiometric quantity of fresh air,
and with a chamber (25) disposed below the bottleneck with an outlet (27)

for gases,

characterized in that a gas chamber (43) separate from the chamber (25)
is provided which includes a gas inlet (45) for a fluidizing and reaction gas,

that the gas chamber (43) is closed at the top by a bottom (35) through
which nozzles (37) pass, that a fluidizing space (29; 75) containing inert,

fluidizable material is formed above the bottom (35), and that the fluidizing
space includes an inlet (31) for the introduction of the fluidizable material

and is in gas conductive communication with the chamber (25).
Gasification reactor as claimed in claim 8,

characterized in that the fluidizing space (29) is formed in the bottom area
of the chamber (25).
Gasification reactor as claimed in claim 8,

characterized in that the fluidizing space (29a, 29b; 75) is separated from
the chamber (25) by a wall (1a; 73) and includes a flue gas conduit (71)

which may be connected to the shaft (1) above the bottleneck (17, 19).
Gasification reactor as claimed in claim 10,

characterized in that the fluidizing space (75) is located below the shaft (1)
and the horizontally extending wall (73) closes the shaft (1) at its lower

end. 
Gasification reactor as claimed in claim 10,

characterized in that the fluidizing space is divided into two partial spaces

(1) and the other one (29b) next to it, that the wall (1a) defines the lower
end of a vertical, lateral limiting wall of the shaft (1) and leaves open a

lateral passage (67) to establish a connection between the two partial
spaces (29a, 29b), that the gas chamber (43) is divided by a partition wall
