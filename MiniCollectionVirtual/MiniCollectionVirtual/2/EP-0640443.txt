<ABSTRACT>
A fluid-operated torque tool for tightening and 
loosening threaded connectors has an engaging element 

having an axis and two axial ends with at least one of the 
ends adapted to engage a threaded connector to be tightened or 

loosened, and a driving element which is displaceable under 
the action of a working fluid in an axial direction of the 

engaging element and engages with the engaging element so 
that during the axial displacement of the driving element 

the engaging element turns about the axis and therefore 
tightens or loosens a threaded connector engaged by the 

engaging element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid-operated
torque tool for tightening and loosening threaded connectors
such as bolts, nuts and the like.Fluid-operated torque tools of the above mentioned
general type are known in the art and are widely utilized. In
known fluid-operated torque tools the tool works substantially
perpendicular to the drive axis. In other words, when a
fluid-operated torque tool has an engaging element which
engages a threaded connector, and a drive formed as a
fluid-operated cylinder-piston unit, the piston of the drive
is displaced in an axial direction of the cylinder-piston
unit, while the engaging element of the tool turns about an
axis which is perpendicular to the axial direction of the cylinder-piston
unit. Tools of this known type can be improved.Document FR-A-2 343 934 discloses a tool in which a driving
shaft is turned in one direction when fluid power is applied to one side of a piston
and remains stationary due to the provision of a ratchet mechanism when fluid power
is applied to the other side of the piston. Thus the driving shaft is not turned in one
and the same direction when the fluid power is applied to opposite sides of the
piston. Document DE-C-949 999 discloses a tool in which the shaft is
turned in one direction when fluid power is applied at one side of the piston
and in the opposite direction when the fluid power is applied to the opposite
side of the piston. In this known tool the driving shaft also is not turned in one
and the same direction when the fluid power is applied to opposite sides of the
piston.Document US-A-4 513 644 discloses a tool that turns a
driving shaft in one direction when fluid power is applied to one side of a piston
and turns the housing (38) of the tool in the opposite direction when fluid power
is applied to the other side of the piston, while the drive shaft remains
stationary. Also, the tool does not turn the driving shaft in one and the same
direction when fluid power is applied alternately to opposite sides of the piston.Finally, the document FR-A-2 418 061 discloses a tool that has
two driving motors, one rotary and one linear. The rotary driving motor turns
the shaft until a certain torque has been reached, at which point the linear
motor applies pressure to a piston which turns the shaft in the same
direction. The shaft does not, however, turn in one and the same direction
when fluid power is applied alternately to opposite sides of the piston. With this
invention it is assumed that after the certain torque has been reached

<CLAIMS>
A fluid-operated torque tool for tightening and
loosening threaded connectors, comprising a housing (34); an

engaging element (1) mounted in the housing (34) for
rotation about its axis while being axially retained, the

engaging element having a central portion (6) with first and
second sections located near one another in the axial

direction and two opposite axial end portions (2,3) at least
one of which is formed and arranged relative to the housing

to engage a threaded connector to be tightened or loosened;
driving means (20) mounted for axial displacement relative

to the engaging element (1) and having a first driving
member (21); displacing means for supplying working fluid

consecutively to opposite sides of the driving means (20) to
displace the driving means axially relative to the engaging

element (1) consecutively in a first axial direction and
then in the opposite second axial direction; first

engaging means in the form of a first set of helical formations (8) on said first section of said
central portion (6); second engaging means in the form of first projections (32) on said first driving member (21),

the first and second engaging means
cooperating with each other on movement of the driving means

(20) in said first axial direction under the action of
working fluid supplied by said displacing means to turn the

engaging element (1) relative to the housing (34) in a first
rotational sense; and ratchet means comprising a first

ratchet (24) connected to the first driving member (21) and
arranged to prevent its rotation relative to the housing in

a second rotational sense opposite to said first rotational
sense while being free to rotate in said first rotational

sense; 
characterised in that
 the driving means (20) further
comprises a second driving member (22), the first and second

driving members (21,22) being mounted about the engaging
element (1) and connected to each other so that they are

jointly axially displaceable while being capable of rotation
relative to each other, 
in that
 the ratchet means further 
comprises a second ratchet (25) connected to the second

driving member (22) so as to be axially displaceable
relative thereto while being coupled therewith for rotation,

the second ratchet (25) being arranged so that it is
prevented from rotation relative to the housing in said

second rotational sense while being free to rotate in said
first rotational sense, 
in that
 the tool further
comprises third engaging means in the form of a second set of helical formations (9) on said

second section of said central portion and fourth engaging means in the form of second projections (33) on said second
driving member (22),

and 
in that
 the helical formations of said first set are inclined in opposite directions to the helical formations of said second set,
said third and fourth

engaging means cooperating with each other on axial movement of the driving means (20),
the said engaging means (8,9,32,33) and the said first and

second ratchets being constructed and arranged such that if
the driving means (20) is moved in the first axial

direction, the first ratchet (24) and the first driving
member (21) are prevented from rotating in said second

rotational sense so that, due to the cooperation of the
first and second engaging means (8,32), the engaging element

(1) turns relative to the housing (34) in the first
rotational sense and the second driving member (22) and the

second ratchet (25) rotate relative to the engaging element
and the housing in the first rotational sense, and such that

if the driving means is moved in the second axial direction,
the second ratchet (25) and the second driving member (22)

are prevented from rotating in said second rotational sense
so that, due to the cooperation of the third and fourth

engaging means, the engaging element (1) turns relative to
the housing (34) in the first rotational sense and the first

driving member (21) and the first ratchet (24) rotate
relative to the engaging element (1) and the housing (34) in

the first rotational sense, the engaging element (1) thereby
turning only in one circumferential direction thereby

tightening or loosening a threaded connector engaged by the
engaging element.

19) engageable with counter-teeth (28, 29) of respective
