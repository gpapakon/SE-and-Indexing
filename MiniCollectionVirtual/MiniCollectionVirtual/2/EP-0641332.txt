<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the selective 
epoxidation, especially the monoepoxidation, of 
butadiene. More specifically, this invention pertains 
to the catalytic epoxidation of butadiene using an 
oxygen-containing gas and a supported, thallium-promoted, 
silver catalyst. The selective oxidation of certain olefins having 
more than 2 carbon atoms and no allylic hydrogen atoms 
with an oxygen-containing gas is described in U.S. 
Patent 4,897,498. The process disclosed in that patent 
is performed in the presence of a silver catalyst which 
may contain as promoters the residues of certain alkali 
metal and alkaline earth metal compounds. The patent 
specifically describes the preparation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
by the monoepoxidation of butadiene with 
molecular oxygen in the presence of a supported, cesium-promoted, 
silver catalyst. EP 369,902 and EP 389,389 
also describe selective oxidation processes for the 
preparation of epoxides of aromatic olefins such as 
styrene and bicyclic olefins such as norbornene. U.S. Patent 4,267,073 describes a process for the 
production of ethylene oxide by the oxidation of 
ethylene with an oxygen-containing gas in the presence 
of catalysts comprising a porous refractory support 
having deposited on its exterior and interior surfaces 
from about 1% to 25% by weight of silver and certain 
amounts of thallium metal compounds. According to this 
patent, the use of such thallium-promoted silver 
catalysts in the oxidation of ethylene results in 
improved selectivity to ethylene oxide relative to known 
catalysts in general and to unpromoted silver catalysts 
in particular. No improvement in catalytic activity,  
 
i.e., in ethylene conversion, is mentioned in the 
patent. We have discovered that butadiene may be converted 
to its monoepoxide by contacting it with an oxygen-containing 
gas in the presence of a supported, thallium-promoted, 
silver catalyst. The process provided by our 
invention therefore comprises the preparation of the 
monoepoxide of 1,3-butadiene, which comprises contacting 
1,3-butadiene with an oxygen-containing gas in the 
presence of a supported, thallium-promoted, silver 
catalyst at epoxide-forming conditions of pressure and 
temperature. The catalysts used in the process of the present 
invention consist essentially of a catalyst support 
material having deposited on its surface 1 to 30 weight 
percent silver and 10 to 5000 parts per million (ppm) by 
weight thallium. The weight percentage silver and ppm 
thallium are based on the total weight
