<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for colouring optical fibres, each fibre (1) being drawn through an upper nozzle (3) in a colouring tool (2) into a colour chamber (5), into which colorant is introduced, and further through a lower nozzle (4) out of the colour chamber (5). The coloured fibre is passed onward through a quartz tube (7) of a UV lamp (6) curing the colorant. To reduce costs and to increase the production rate, the colouring tools (2) are arranged close to each other in pairs in at lest two different planes, and the fibres (1) to be coloured are drawn simultaneously through the colouring tools (2) and further simultaneously through the quartz tube (7) of the UV lamp (6) common to the fibres to be coloured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for colouring
optical fibres, wherein each fibre is drawn through an
upper nozzle in a colouring tool into a colour chamber,
into which colorant is introduced, and further
through a lower nozzle out of the colour chamber, and
wherein the coloured fibre is passed onward through a
quartz tube of a UV lamp curing the colorant. The
invention also relates to an arrangement for colouring
optical fibres.Optical fibres are used more and more extensively
in different technical fields, such as telecommunication
technology. The small size and fragile structure
of optical fibres, however, make them difficult
to handle. Similarity in appearance of fibres also
causes problems in practical applications as it is
difficult to distinguish different fibres from each
other without an identification system.It is therefore a common practice to colour
different fibres with different colours, and so individual
fibres are easier to distinguish from each
other.At present, optical fibres are coloured e.g. by
UV curable colorants. They are coloured one by one in
a separate coloration process mainly comprising a
colouring tool and UV lamps for curing the colorant.
The colouring tool comprises successive nozzles and a
colour chamber between the nozzles. The UV lamps
comprise a quartz tube through which the fibre passes.
The fibre to be coloured is drawn through the upper
nozzle and the colour chamber and further through the
lower nozzle. At the same time colorant is introduced
into the colour chamber so that it adheres to the
surface of the fibre. After the lower nozzle, the 
fibre is drawn into the quartz tube of the UV lamp so that the UV radiation
generated by the lamp cures the colorant on the surface of the fibre. A
separate apparatus of this kind is arranged for each fibre to be coloured.The above-described prior art includes e.g. US Patent
4,629,285.DE-A-3407520 describes a colouring tool for colouring a
single optical fibre, having an upper, input and a lower, output nozzle with
a colouring chamber in between. The optical fibre is coloured by drawing
the optical fibre through the colouring tool.US-A-4,570,571 describes apparatus for colouring and curing
a plurality of optical fibres, simultaneously. Each optical fibre is passed
through a pair of opposing wheels which nip the fibre and simultaneously
coat it with paint previously coated on the opposing wheels. By placing a
large number of opposing wheels in a line, a plurality of fibres may be
simultaneously coated and then drawn through a

A method for colouring optical fibres comprising the steps of
providing a compact colouring module for colouring optical fibres (1)

comprising at least four colouring tools (2) arranged in close proximity,
each colouring tool (2) comprising an input nozzle (3), a colour chamber (5)

and an output nozzle (4), wherein a first pair of the colouring tools (2) is
arranged in a first plane perpendicular to the direction of travel of the fibres

(1) through the colouring module, and a second pair of the colouring tools
is arranged in a second plane substantially parallel to the first plane, the

four colouring tools (2) of said first and second pairs forming a substantially
square arrangement when viewed in said direction of travel of the fibres

(1), the first pair of tools being at diagonally opposite corners of the square,

and the second pair of tools being at the other diagonally opposite corners
of the square; treating the fibres (1) simultaneously by drawing each fibre (1) through an input nozzle (3) into a

colour chamber (5), into which colorant is introduced, and further through
an output nozzle (4) and by curing each coloured fibre by passing it out of the

colour chamber (5) and further onward through the quartz tube (7) of a UV
lamp (6) common to the fibres (1); wherein the square formed by the at least four colouring tools (2)

has dimensions such that the fibres (1) passing through the module can be
directly and simultaneously passed through the quartz tube (7) of said UV

lamp (6).
A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising the step of
evenly spreading the UV-light from the lamp (6) within the quartz tube (7)

by means of mirrors (8).
