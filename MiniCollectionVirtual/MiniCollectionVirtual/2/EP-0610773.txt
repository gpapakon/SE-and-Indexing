<ABSTRACT>
A cassette essentially comprises flat casing parts and front, rear and side walls as well as a closure element for the openings of the front side, the front side being adapted such that it can be completed partly by means of a front part which can be fastened on the casing. Front part and closure member are in this case produced from injection-mouldable plastic with thickness dimensions assigned to them. The front part is provided with cleaning elements. The cassette can be used whenever thin wall thicknesses are required and there is a closure element.
