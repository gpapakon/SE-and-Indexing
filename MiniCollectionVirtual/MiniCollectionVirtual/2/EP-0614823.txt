<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) particularly usable for the temporary 
storage of confectionery or food products which can be 

easily consumed by their purchasers. The container comprises 
a tray (2) which can be stacked prior to the step in which 

it is filled with the confectionery or food products (5) and 
has, at its upper perimetric edge (3), at least one seat 

(7a, 7b) for an item of cutlery (10). The item of cutlery 
can be accessed by the user when the product is consumed; 

its administration and its practicality in use are therefore 
facilitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container 
particularly usable for confectionery or food products. Many kinds of food products are currently commercially 
available which are usually stored in plastic containers and 
can be consumed after removing an adapted removable lid. The use of plastic containers, used for example for 
yogurts, allows both preservation of the organoleptic 
characteristics of the product and ease in transport, since 
the container can withstand slight impacts. A drawback observed in these known types of containers 
resides in the fact that before the step in which they are 
filled with the product they occupy hardly negligible 
spaces, thus increasing storage costs for manufacturers. 
Secondly, said known products can be consumed only once the 
purchaser has returned home, since a small spoon is required 
to pick up the product. A principal object of the present invention is 
therefore to solve the described technical problems, 
eliminating the drawbacks observed in known types and thus 
obtaining a container for confectionery or food products 
which has optimum storage characteristics prior to the 
filling step and allows the purchaser to consume the product 
when desired. Another important object is to provide a container 
which is reliable and safe in use in compliance with 
hygienic rules. Another object is to provide a container having low 
manufacturing costs and which can be obtained with  
 
conventional known machines. With these and other objects in view, there is 
provided, according to the present invention, a container, 
particularly for confectionery or food products, comprising 
a stackable tray having, at its upper perimetric edge, at 
least one seat which can be re-closed by a lid and 
accommodates an item of cutlery. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of a particular but not exclusive embodiment 
thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example 
in the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a top view of the container with the lid 
applied thereto; figure 2 is a sectional view, taken along the plane II-II 
of figure 1, in which the item of cutlery and the lid 
have been omitted for the sake of clarity; figure 3 is a sectional view, taken along the plane 
III-III, of a plurality of mutually stacked containers, in 
which the item of cutlery and the lid have been omitted for 
the sake of clarity; figure 4 is a sectional view, taken along the plane IV-IV, 
ill

Container (1), particularly for confectionery or 
food products, characterized in that it comprises a 

stackable tray (2) having, at an upper perimetric edge (3)

by a lid (11) and accommodates an item of cutlery (10). 
Container according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a tray (2) made of plastics and 

essentially frustrum-shaped with an upper perimetric edge 
(3) at which an opening (4) is formed for access to said 

confectionery or food product (5), said trays being provided 
with side walls (6) having such an inclination as to allow 

the stacking of a plurality of trays. 
Container according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that one or more pairs of seats (7a, 7b) are defined 

along at least one diagonal axis at said upper perimetric 
edge (3), the tip (8) and the opposite end (9) of an item of 

cutlery (10), such as for example a small spoon, being 
arrangeable at said seats. 
Container according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that one or more seats are defined at said upper 

perimetric edge along at least one longitudinal or 
transverse axis, the tip or the opposite end of an item of 

cutlery, such as for example a small spoon, being 
arrangeable at said seats. 
Container according to claims 3 or 4, characterized 
in that said one or more pairs of seats (7a, 7b) are defined 

with such a depth as to allow to contain said item of 
cutlery (10) below the plane of arrangement of said upper 

 
perimetric edge (3), so as to allow to apply on said edge a 

sealing lid (11) which can be removed by the user. 
Container according to claims 3 to 5, characterized 
in that said one or more pairs of seats (7a, 7b) are defined 

at adapted wings (12a, 12b) protruding slightly beyond said 
side walls (6) of said tray. 
Container according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that adapted means (13) suitable to 

facilitate the stacking of said trays are present below at 
least one of said pairs of seats and at least one of the 

remaining corners of said tray, said means being constituted 
by adapted teeth (13) in which the end (14) directed toward 

the bottom of said trays interacts either with said upper 
perimetric edge of the underlying tray or with the bottom of 

one of said pairs of seats. 
Container according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the depth of said teeth (13) is such as to allow the 

stacking of said trays without causing the mutual contact of 
said bottoms (15) and of said side walls (6). 
Container according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said item of cutlery (10) is
