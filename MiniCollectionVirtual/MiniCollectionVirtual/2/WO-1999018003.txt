<ABSTRACT>
The invention falls within the sector of stoppers for opened bottles. An external body (1) is provided with an upper opening (4) designed to allow rotation of a lever (8) having an eccentricity (9). Operation of the said lever allows, by means of the intervening arrangement of a cylindrical helical spring (22), lowering of an internal body (16) against a toroidal spring (15). Radial deformation thereof allows gripping of the neck of the bottle underneath its shoulder.

<DESCRIPTION>
 UNIVERSAL STOPPER FOR OPENED BOTTLES DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a univeral stopper for opened bottles. In order to ensure the closure of opened bottles, various types of stoppers have been devised, all of which can be substantially classified in two main groups: stoppers which perform closure of the bottle by causing expansion of one of their components inside the neck of the bottle itself and stoppers which embrace the external surface of the neck of the bottle, making use of its shoulder to ensure a good gripping action. All these stoppers are provided with means designed to ensure removal of the stopper itself, if possible using a small amount of physical force. A drawback present in many of the stoppers which are currently commercially available is that they may be difficult to adapt to the various types of necks which may arise.The object of the present invention is that of providing a stopper which is extremely versatile and easy to use.These and other objects are all achieved by the universal stopper for opened bottles according to the present invention, characterized in that it comprises: - an external body which is substantially cylindrical and internally hollow and provided with an upper opening designed to allow rotation of a lever; the bottom part of said external body being provided with a circular opening designed to allow the neck of a bottle to pass through and being provided internally with a circumferential flaring designed to seat a toroidal spring; said spring being able to perform external circumferential locking of the neck of the bottle underneath the associated shoulder;- an internal body, which is substantially cylindrical and designed to slide longitudinally along the internal surface of the said external body, said internal body having its bottom edge in contact with the toroidal spring; 

- a cylindrical helical compression spring which is positioned between the top part of the internal body and a disk arranged in turn between the said spring and the lever; said spring being designed to convert the rotational movement of this lever into the radial deformation of the toroidal spring in order to compensate for the differences existing both in the diameters of the necks of the various bottles and in the heights of the various shoulders.These and other characteristic features will emerge more clearly from the following description of a preferred embodiment illustrated, purely by way of a non-limiting example, in the accompanying illustrative plate in which: -

CLAIMS
1. Universal stopper for opened bottles, characterized in that it comprises:
- a substantially cylindrical and internally hollow external body (1) provided with an upper opening (4) designed to allow the rotation of a lever (8); the bottom part of said external body being provided with a circular opening (7) which is designed to allow the neck of a bottle to pass through and being provided internally with a circumferential flaring (14) designed to seat a toroidal spring (15); said spring being able to perform external circumferential locking of the neck of the bottle underneath the associated shoulder;
- an internal body (16) which is substantially cylindrical and designed to slide longitudinally along the internal surface of the external body (1), said internal body having its bottom edge in contact with the toroidal spring (15);
- a cylindrical helical compression spring (22) which is positioned between the top part of the internal body (16) .and a disk (20) arranged in turn between the said spring and the lever (8); said spring being designed to convert the rotational movement of this lever into the radial deformation of the toroidal spring (15) in order to compensate for the differences existing both in the diameters of the necks of the various bottles and in the heights of the various shoulders.
2. Universal stopper according to Claim 1, characterized in that the external body (1) is composed of two portions (2) and (3), respectively an upper portion and lower portion; the connection between said two portions being effected by means of an external threading (5) present on the bottom edge of the upper portion (2) and an internal threading (6) correspondingly formed on the top edge of the lower portion (3).
3. Universal stopper according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the top part of the upper portion (2) is substantially dome shaped and has an opening (4) formed with a centred slit having a width slightly greater than the thickness of the lever (8) so as to allow 


 rotation thereof.
4. Universal stopper according to Claims 1 and 3, characterized in that the upper portion (2) has a crest (2a) centred with the longitudinal axis of the slit forming the upper opening (4); said slit continuing also into the thickness of the said crest only on the side thereof facing the said upper opening; the remaining sides of the crest (2a) being closed; said crest being intended both to provide a support for the thumb during operation of the lever (8) and to form a protection for the latter against accidental operation.
5. Universal stopper according to Claims 1 and 3, characterized in that the lever (8) is pivotably hinged on the upper portion (2) of the external body (1) by means of two identical circular projections (13) which are symmetrically located on the two opposite sides of the said lever; said projections corresponding, in diameter and thickness, to the diameter and the depth of two semi-circular recesses (12) each formed in the thickness of each of the facing sides of the upper opening (4); the two said projections together forming the pivot for rotation of the lever (8).
6. Universal stopper according to Claims 1 and 5, characterized in that the lever (8) has two substantially radial arms (8): an operating arm (10) and an opening arm (11), both the said arms being designed to be operated by the fingers.
7. Universal stopper according to Claim 1, characterized in that the bottom internal edge of the internal body (16) is provided with a chamfering (19) designed to favour the compression of the toroidal spring (15) against the neck of the bottle sliding along the external edge of the said spring.
8. Universal stopper according to Claim 1 , characterized in that the cylindrical helical spring (22) rests against a circular diaphragm (17) positioned just below the top edge of the internal body (16) and forming an integral part thereof; below the said diaphragm, the internal body (16) is completely hollow, said cavity being designed to seat the neck of the 


 bottles.
9. Universal stopper according to Claims 1 and 8, characterized in that the circular diaphragm (17) has in its centre a blind recess (18) designed to form a guide for the vertical sliding of a piston (21) which is integrally attached to the bottom side of the disk (20), the cylindrical helical spring (22) being circumferential with respect to the said piston.
10. Universal stopper according to Claim 1, characterized in that the upper portion (2) and the lower portion (3) of the external body (1) comprise force- fitting joints for joining them together.
11. Universal stopper according to Claim 1 , characterized in that it comprises a seal (23) positioned underneath the circular diaphragm (17), a spring being inserted between the seal (23) and the circular diaphragm (17).
