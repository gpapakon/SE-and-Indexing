<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-distortion 
cascode circuit for high-frequency 
communications, and relates more particularly to a low-distortion 
cascode circuit corresponding to a frequency 
converter or an amplifier of excellent low-distortion 
characteristics. As a frequency converter (mixer) for a 
communication unit, a cascode circuit using a dual-gate 
field effect transistor (hereinafter to be referred to as 
a FET) has been widely known. An example of the conventional 
dual-gate FET is disclosed in the "GaAs Dual-Gate 
MESFETS's IEEE, Trans. Electron Devices, vol. ED-25, pp. 
580-586", issued in June 1978. The above-described prior-art technique is 
characterized in that the dimensions of two FET's are set 
the same. The prior-art dual-gate FET can be considered 
to be the cascode configuration of the FET's having 
almost the same electric characteristics. The outline of a dual-gate FET which is 
operated as a frequency converter will be explained with 
reference to Fig. 6. Equivalent circuits of the dual-gate 
FET are shown as a cascode connection of two FET's 1 
and 2. When the dual-gate FET is operated as a down-converter 
(mixer), an RF signal is applied to the gate of  
 
the lower-stage FET 1 from a terminal 5. A local signal 
is applied to the gate of the upper-stage FET 2 from a 
terminal 4. Functions of the FET's 1 and 2 will be 
explained below. The FET 1 functions as a voltage 
control type resistor which is modulated by an RF signal 
applied to the gate. The FET 2 has two functions. One 
is the function of a source follower for applying a local 
signal to the resistor. Since a local signal is applied 
to the resistor that has been modulated by the RF signal, 
a component of a product of both signals occurs in a 
current Id that flows through the resistor, so that a 
mixing function is achieved. The other function of the 
FET 2 is the function of an amplifier of a gate ground 
type. The current Id that flows through the resistor is 
outputted from the drain. As described above, according to the prior-art 
technique, dimensions of the gates of the two FET's are 
set to be the same. There is also an example that the 
gate length of the second FET is set to be longer to have 
an improved breakdown voltage. This, however, has a 
problem that there is a risk of an occurrence of a 
distortion characteristics such as a third-order harmonic 
distortion, because the second FET can not operate as an 
ideal source follower or an ideal gate ground type 
amplifier as described above. In
