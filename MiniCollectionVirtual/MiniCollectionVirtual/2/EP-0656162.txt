<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a CDMA communication system comprising at least a transmitter in which a data sequence is spread with the code sequence and comprising at least a receiver in which the data sequences are recovered by a detector, estimate sequences for the values of the transmitted data sequences being computed for the purpose of the detection while a description of the communication channel between the transmitter or transmitters and a receiver is incorporated. For the detection of data sequences there is provided to compute joint probability distributions for the transmitted data sequences by computing the associated moments and determine therefrom the estimate sequences for the transmitted data sequences.

<DESCRIPTION>
CDMA communication system.The invention relates to a CDMA communication system comprising at least a transmitter in which a data sequence is spread by a code sequence and comprising at least a receiver in which the data sequences are recovered by a detector, sequences of estimates for the transmitted data sequences being computed for the purpose of the detection while a description of the communication channel situated between the transmitter or transmitters and a receiver is incorporated. The invention likewise relates to a receiver for a CDMA communication system and, more specifically, to a detector for such a receiver.In a communication system based on Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) the signals of various users are simultaneously transmitted in a common frequency band and with a common carrier frequency. Code-division multiple access systems are based on a spread band technique, that is to say, the signal to be transmitted is spread out over a frequency band which is substantially wider than the minimum frequency band necessary for transmitting the signal. As a result of the spreading of the band, code-division multiple access systems are generally highly insensitive to interference.For frequency band spreading in digital communication systems, for example, each bit to be transmitted is multiplied by a codeword mutually agreed upon by transmitter and receiver. When mutually orthogonal codewords are used, mutual interference by the signals from the individual users is ruled out in principle. But realistic requirements as to wave propagation over the surface of the earth such as multipath propagation lead to the fact that this orthogonality is no longer adhered to. If, in addition, a synchronization of the accesses by the individual users is dispensed with to realise a highly simple access to the common frequency band, or if different bit rates are permitted, the signal of a user can be detected only with more circuitry and cost or with a degraded quality, because the signals can no longer be mutually orthogonal.From "Linear Multiuser Detectors for Synchronous Code-Division Multiple-Access Channels" by Ruxandra Lupas and Sergio Verdœç, published in IEEE 

Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 35, no. 1, January 1989, pp. 123-136, are already known detectors for a CDMA receiver in which detectors various users are detected simultaneously. By simultaneously detecting various users, the quality of the detection can be improved by increasing the circuitry in that the cross-correlation between the
