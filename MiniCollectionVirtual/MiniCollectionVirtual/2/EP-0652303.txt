<ABSTRACT>
An evaporator for generating vapour for deposition as 
a coating on a web substrate(21) in a vacuum web coating 

process comprises evaporation means(15,32) having vapour 
outlet means(29) through which coating material(36) is 

conveyed from the evaporation means and deposited on the 
substrate(21). The evaporation means further comprises 

means whereby an inert gas may be fed to the evaporation 

means to quench evaporation of the material and/or to cool 
the evaporation means. The evaporation may thereby be 

halted rapidly to allow replacement of the substrate and/or 
the coating material. The inert gas may advantageously be 

recirculated through refrigeration means and some or all of 
the inert gas may be 'back-fed' into the evaporation means 

through the vapour outlet means. 
The apparatus enables the stoppage times in the 
coating process to be significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an evaporator suitable for vaporising coating material in 
vacuum web coating processes, to apparatus for web coating and to a process of web 
coating using the evaporator. In vapour deposition processes coating material is vaporised in a heated crucible 
and the vapour is condensed on a surface of the web to be coated, the web generally being 
a large continuous web which is continuously moved through a vapour deposition zone 
by winding gear. The deposition zone is usually provided by a chilled metal surface and 
generally is a rotating cold drum over which the web is advanced. In order to avoid 
contaminants the coating process is carried out in a vacuum chamber at high vacuum 
wherein the pressure is generally in the range 1.33-1.33 x 10-2 pascals (10-2 - 10-4 Torr) 
and the process is accordingly termed vacuum web coating. The crucible is generally 
contained in an evaporation retort having an elongated outlet nozzle profiled as a slit 
disposed across the web, through which nozzle the vaporised material is transferred to the 
web surface where it condenses as a thin film coating. Using appropriate transport 
systems one or both sides of a web may be coated with one or more coats of material. 
The thickness and uniformity of the film can be accurately maintained by controlling the 
rate of evaporation of the coating material and the time of exposure of the web substrate 
to the vapour emerging from the nozzle, the exposure time being generally controlled by 
controlling the travel speed of the web relative to the nozzle. Web coating by vapour 
deposition has been described in the book "Web Processing and Converting Technology 
(Van Nostrand Reinhold Company - 1984) - Chapter 11 entitled "High - vacuum roll 
coating" by Ernst K Hartwig". Using this process, well defined film coatings of metals, 
alloys or other materials having thicknesses typically of less than 0.1µm(micron) can be  
 
applied to substrates such as paper or plastic as thin as 1.0µm (micron). In the usual apparatus the deposition zone is provided at the surface of a chilled 
rotating drum through which cooling fluid, usually at about -30°C is continuously 
circulated. The web is advanced in a continuous manner around the chilled drum from a 
pay-off roll to a take-up roll. Either or both of these web-carrying rolls may be inside the 
vacuum chamber and in this case, when the web requires to be replaced or coated material 
has to be removed, the process must be temporarily stopped. Additional stoppages are
