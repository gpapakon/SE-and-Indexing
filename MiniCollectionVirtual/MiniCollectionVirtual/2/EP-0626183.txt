<ABSTRACT>
A laminated material for preventing fire in the engine 
room of a ship has a base layer made of a woven or nonwoven 

fabric of specific fibers, and aluminum foil or the like 
bonded to at least one side of the base layer. Since 

aluminum foil or the similar foil having an excellent 
sealing ability and a property of plastic deformability is 

bonded to one or both of the opposite surfaces of the base 

layer having excellent heat resistance, excellent oil 
resistance and sufficient strength, defects of the fabric 

and those of aluminum foil are eliminated, and synergistic 
benefits can be obtained. In a method for preventing fire 

in the engine room of a ship, the laminated material is cut 
out to obtain a laminated tape and a laminated sheet, which 

are used in combination to cover portions having various 
configurations. According to this method, even unskilled 

persons can securely cover portions from which oil is likely 
to spout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a use of a laminated material for preventing a flammable
liquid spouting out a portion from which the flammable liquid is likely to spout in an
engine room of a ship and a method of preventing a flammable liquid spouting out a
portion from which the flammable liquid is likely to spout in an engine room of a ship.Recently, ship fires have occurred frequently, and in
the past thirteen years from 1980 to 1992, 73 ships
experienced fires in the engine rooms (small fires and fires
which were not reported due to sinking of ships are
excluded).The primary cause of the engine room fires was spouting
of fuel oil or lubricant oil from a fuel oil piping device
or a lubricant oil piping device. In detail, one of fuel
oil piping devices or lubricant oil piping devices connected
to a main engine and an auxiliary engine for a generator
(hereinafter simply referred to as "auxiliary engine") got
loose, generated cracks, or got out of place by vibrations
of engines to cause spouting of oils. The spouted oil
contacted a surface having a high temperature, such as an 
exhaust pipe and a pipe of a turbo charger to catch fire.
About 60% of the engine room fires were caused by the above-mentioned
oil spouting.Spouting of fuel oil from fuel oil piping devices
connected to a main engine is caused, for example, by
breakage of fastening bolts for securing an inlet flange of
a fuel oil supply pipe to a fuel injection pump, coming off
a drain valve connected to the fuel oil supply pipe,
breakage of an air vent pipe connected to the fuel oil
supply pipe, breakage of a cock connected to a fuel oil
return pipe, breakage of a short vinyl hose coupled to the
fuel oil return pipe, and cracking of a welded portion of a
connector for the fuel oil supply pipe. Spouting of fuel
oil from fuel oil piping devices connected to an auxiliary
engine is caused, for example, by breakage of a cooling oil
pipe for a fuel valve, looseness of a fuel oil supply pipe,
breakage of a pressure measurement pipe connected to the
fuel oil supply pipe, breakage of a pipe connected to a
differential pressure gauge of a fuel oil filter due to
explosion of an intake pipe, and looseness of a connector
for a fuel injection pump.In view of the foregoing, a world-wide study has
started to develop means for preventing oil from spouting
out of fuel oil piping devices or lubricant oil piping
devices connected to a main engine or an auxiliary engine.On approach proposed is to make high-pressure pipes for
a high-pressure fuel pump, a fuel injection

<CLAIMS>
Use of a laminated material for preventing a flammable liquid spouting out a
portion from which the flammable liquid is likely to spout in an engine room of a

ship which comprises:

a base layer made of a woven fabric of aramid fibers,
an aluminum foil which is bonded to each surface of the base layer; and
a peelable separator layer is further adhered to the laminated material by the
use of an adhesive.
Method for preventing a flammable liquid spouting out a portion from which the
flammable liquid is likely to spout in an engine room of a ship, which comprises

the following steps of:

providing a laminated material consisting of a base layer made of a woven fabric
of aramid fibers, an aluminium foil which is bonded to each surface of the

base layer and an adhesive covering one of the aluminum foil surfaces,
cutting out the laminated material to obtain a tape; and
winding the tape around a portion from which the flammable liquid is likely to
spout.
Method for preventing a flammable liquid spouting out a portion from which the
flammable liquid is likely to spout in an engine room of a ship, which comprises

the following steps of:

providing a laminated material consisting of a base layer made of a woven fabric
of aramid fibers, an aluminum foil which is bonded to each surface of the

base layer and an adhesive covering one of the aluminium foil surfaces,
cutting out the laminated material to obtain a sheet having a size suitable for
covering the portion from which the flammable liquid is likely to spout,
cutting out the laminated material to obtain a tape,
winding the sheet around the portion at least two turns,
pressing the sheet onto the portion for close contact with the portion; and
winding the tape over the sheet such that the turns overlap each other in a
regular pattern.
Method according to claim 2 or claim 3 further comprising the step of providing
a protection cover made of the laminated material for entirely covering a high

temperature surface in an engine room with a clearance being formed between
said protection cover and said high temperature surface so that the fuel oil or

the like is prevented from contacting said high temperature surface.
