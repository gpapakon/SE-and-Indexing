<ABSTRACT>
The integrated electronic elements with variable electrical characteristics, in accordance with the invention, each include at least one microcavity (16) in which at least one movable element (17-18) moves with a limited movement, this movable element being made of an insulating material at least partially covered with electrically conductive material and interacting with at least one microwave circuit on the substrate (19-20), and means creating an electric field in order to move the movable element.
