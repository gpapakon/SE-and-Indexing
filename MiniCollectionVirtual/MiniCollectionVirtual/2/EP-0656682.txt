<ABSTRACT>
This dimmer including a static commutator (10), a pilot with a connection means (30) associated with a chaining line (15) and a time delay, is characterised in that the pilot comprises an oscillator (25, 26) with carrier frequency modulated by the terminal signals, while the time delay comprises a detector (35) for re-establishing terminal signals from the modulated carrier frequency. The connection means is a transformer (30) with a winding (32) isolated from the dimmer and connected to the chaining line (15).

A voltage variator to be interposed between an ac voltage 
network (5, 6) and a load and associable within a group of variators in 

which a master imposes its regulation on at least one slave by way of a 
chaining line (15), the variator comprising: 


a static switch (10) with triggered conduction which is switched 
by a control pulse with a regulated delay in relation to the origin of 

half-periods of the network; 
a pilot means, neutralised when the variator is a slave, 
delivering to a means (30) for connection to the chaining line limit 

signals which are separated by an adjusted time interval corresponding 
to the regulated delay; and 
a time delay means responsive to the limit signals on the 
connecting means for registering in a memory the time interval which 

separates the limit signals and switched on by the passage through zero 
of the network voltage applied to the variator to deliver to the static 

switch a control pulse at the end of the registered interval; 
 
   characterised in that the pilot means comprises an oscillator (25, 

26) with a carrier frequency which is modulated by the limit signals 
while the time delay means comprises a detector (35) for reestablishing 

the limit signals from the modulated carrier frequency, 
the connecting means being formed by a transformer (30) adapted to the 

carrier frequency, with a winding (32) isolated from the variator and 
connected to the chaining line (15) which is then a two-wire line. 
A variator according to claim 1 characterised in that it 
comprises a microprocessor (20) programmed to co-ordinate the operations 

of the pilot means and the time delay means.  
 
A variator according to claim 2 characterised in that it 
comprises manually controlled means (45) for generation of a numerical 

signal representative of the time interval which separates the limit 
signals, which are coupled to the microprocessor (20) to form 

corresponding limit signals. 
A variator according to claim 3 characterised in that it 
comprises a set (16) of terminals for connection of the microprocessor 

to remote control means, the microprocessor being programmed to modify 
the numerical signal representative of the interval separating the limit 

signals in response to actions on the remote regulating means. 
A variator according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that the pilot means comprises limit signals formed by a pair of 

pulses of distinct duration, means associated with the memory of the 
time delay means being provided to discriminate the pulses of the pair 

by virtue of their duration for memory registration of the time interval 

which separates them. 
A variator according to claim 5 characterised in that the pilot 
means comprises means for memory storage of the adjusted time interval 

and means responsive to the variations in the content of the memory 
means for triggering in response emission of pairs of limit signals 

separated by a time interval corresponding to the modified content of 
the memory means.
