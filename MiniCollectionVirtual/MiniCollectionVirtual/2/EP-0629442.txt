<ABSTRACT>
A novel process is described for producing a supported catalyst including palladium, platinum, nickel, cobalt or copper on an aerogel as support, starting from a preparation which contains an alkoxide precursor of the aerogel and a soluble complex of, for example, palladium with a chelating agent, the chelating agent having Si(OR)3 anchor groups. Water is then added to the preparation for hydrolysis and the mixture is converted under supercritical conditions into the aerogel-supported transition metal catalyst. The supported catalyst is distinguished by particularly homogeneous distribution of the metal component. It is suitable for example for use as hydrogenation catalyst.
