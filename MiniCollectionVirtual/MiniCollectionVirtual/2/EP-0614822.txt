<ABSTRACT>
The outer surface of an article (10) is covered with a 
wrapping film (1), and the both edges of the film (1) are lap-welded 

with each other to constitute a body seal section (4). 
A first slit (6) is formed along the body seal section (4), 

substantially parallel thereto, and is spaced a small distance 
apart therefrom. A second slit (7) is formed in the body seal 

section (4) substantially at right angles or an inclined angle 
to the edge of the body seal section (4). When the end (4a) of 

the first slit (6) is peeled off, the film (1) splits along the 
body seal section (4) and also towards the second slit (7). 

The second slit (7) helps the split to stretch further in the 
transverse direction of the article (10). As a result of this, 

the wrapping film (1) splits in both the longitudinal and 
lateral directions thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article wrapped with a wrapping 
film, 
according to the preamble of claim 1 and 5, respectively. Of various types of recent commodities arranged in a shop, 
in the case of relatively small products having a regular shape 
such as a magnetic tape cassette, the product is wrapped with a 
transparent or translucent wrapping film coated with cellophane, 
polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylidenechloride, 
or the like, in order to protect the product 
from dust or moisture and so maintain a good appearance. 
These magnetic tape cassettes are shipped as a wrapped article 
or displayed at the shop as one of packages to be sold en block 
in which an appropriate number of goods are collectively 
packed. As a matter of course, when an article (a product) wrapped 
in this type of wrapping film is used, it is necessary to 
remove this wrapping film. In most cases, as shown in Figure 
47, a tearing tape 2 is formed inside the wrapping film, and a 
constitution for facilitating the removal of the film from an 
article 10 is generally adopted. In other words, this tearing tape 2 allows a wrapping film 
1 to be appropriately split and separated by pulling an exposed 
end 2a of the tape 2. Slits 3 are formed along this tearing 
tape in the vicinity of the exposed end 2a, thereby facilitating 
the removal of the tape. With such a constitution, the 
wrapping film 1 can be split along the tearing tape 2 from the  
 
end 2a. As a result of this, the wrapping film 1 is split up 
completely or separated in two. A wrapping method which is generally called shrink-wrap is 
widely used for such a wrapping film. In this shrink-wrap, when 
a wrapping film is attached to an article to be wrapped (i.e. a 
product), the product is enclosed in the wrapping film while 
the film is appropriately stretched or heated to a suitable 
temperature in accordance with material of the film. The 
wrapping film is tightly attached on to the product because of 
a contracting action of the film, so that the product is 
enclosed giving it a good appearance. Such a tight attachment 
of the film to the wrapping film involves a laborious removal 
action to open the film. Conventionally, several measures are 
taken to overcome the drawback in the prior art by, for 
example, forming the tearing tape as mentioned above. The 
tearing tape was a very effective means. However, in order to form a tearing tape inside a wrapping 
film, machines and processes which are dedicated to produce the 
tearing tape become

<CLAIMS>
A wrapped article in which the outer surface of an 
article to be wrapped is covered with a wrapping film 

(1) and a body seal section (4) is made by making the 
ends of the wrapping film (1) overlap with each other 

and bonding them together, and at least one slit (7) is 
formed on the periphery of the lower film in such a 

manner as to traverse the body seal section (4),
characterized in that
a first slit (6) is formed in the upper film, substantially parallel to 
the edge of the lower film, said first slit being spaced 

a small distance from the periphery or a bonded part of 
the body seal section (4) and positioned at right angles 

or an inclined angle to said at least one slit forming a 
second slit (7) such that the body seal section (4) is 

split along said second slit (7) when one starts to peal 
off the wrapped film (1) from said first slit (6) in a 

direction (X) toward the body seal section or the bonded 
part of the body seal section. 
A wrapped article as defined in claim 1, wherein said 
second slit (7) is formed in the vicinity of said first 

slit substantially at right angles to said first slit 
(6). 
A wrapped article as defined in claim 1, wherein second 
slits (7a, 7b) are formed and spaced apart from each 

other with said first slit (6) positioned between them.  
 
A wrapped article as defined in at least one of the 
claims 1-3 wherein the longitudinal periphery of the 

body seal section (4) closer to the edge of the lower 
film is kept unbonded, 


said first slit (6) is formed substantially parallel to 
the edge of the lower film portion in the unbonded 

periphery of the body seal section (4); and 
said second slit (7) is formed on the periphery of the

seal section (4).
