<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring device for measuring the phase error of at least one secondary transport unit of a synchronous signal transmitted via a synchronous transmission system (3). The measuring device contains a transmitting unit (1) for forming the synchronous signal to be transmitted, a first desynchroniser (2) for resolving the synchronous signal and for detecting at least one predetermined byte of the secondary transport unit, a second desynchroniser (4) for resolving the received synchronous signal passing through the transmission system (3) and for detecting at least the predetermined byte in the received synchronous signal, and an evaluation unit (5) for calculating the phase error from the detection instants of at least the predetermined byte in the transmitted and received synchronous signal.

Measurement apparatus for measuring the phase
error of at least one lower-level transport unit of a

synchronous signal transmitted via a synchronous
transmission system (3),


having a transmission unit (1) for forming the
synchronous signal to be transmitted;
having a first desynchronizer (2) for buffer-storage
of data (which are contained in the

supplied synchronous signal) of the lower-level
transport unit and for producing a start signal

after the detection of at least one predetermined
byte of the lower-level transport unit;
having a second desynchronizer (4) for buffer-storage
of the data (which are contained in the

received synchronous signal which passes through
the transmission system (3)) of the lower-level

transport unit and for producing a stop signal
after detection of at least the predetermined byte

of the lower-level transport unit in the received
synchronous signal; and
having an evaluation unit (5) which, in response
to the start and stop signal, calculates the phase

error of the lower-level transport unit.
Measurement apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that the first and second desynchronizer (2, 4) each
contain at least 


a buffer store (6) for buffer-storage of data
(which are contained in the supplied synchronous

signal) of a lower-level transport unit,
a write address generator (9) for reception of a
write clock signal obtained from the supplied

synchronous signal and for controlling the process
of writing the data to the buffer store (6),
a control arrangement (8) for forming a control
signal for the write address generator (9) from

the supplied synchronous signal,
a read address generator (10) for controlling the
process of reading the data from the buffer store

(6),
a subtraction arrangement (12) for forming
difference values from the addresses of the write

and read address generators (9, 10),
a circuit (11) for producing a read clock signal,
which is supplied to the read address generator,

from the difference values and
a detection circuit (13) for identifying the
predetermined byte from those bytes which are read

from the buffer store (6) or from those bytes
which are to be written to the buffer store (6)

from the lower-level transport unit.
Measurement apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the evaluation unit (5) has a

counter which is connected to the first desynchronizer
(2) and the second desynchronizer (4).
Measurement apparatus according to Claim 1, 2
or 3,
characterized

in that the synchronous signal is an STM-1 signal in
the synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), and

in that a lower-level transport unit is a virtual
container VC-2, VC-12 or VC-11 or a transport unit of a

plesiochronous signal transported in a VC-2, VC-12 or
VC-11.
