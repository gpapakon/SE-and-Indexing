<ABSTRACT>
A method for screening for potential fungicides identifies 
biochemical or chemical agents that inhibit the 

formation of the fungal sterol ergosterol by inhibiting 
cytochrome P450 reductase or reductase related enzymes or 

proteins involved in its biosynthesis. Test samples are 
incubated in two yeast strain cultures, and the extent of 

growth inhibition is compared between them. One culture 
is supersensitive to cytochrome P450 reductase inhibitors; 

the yeast strain typically contains a disrupted or deleted 
cytochrome P450 reductase gene. The other culture is less 

sensitive to the compounds, typically exhibiting enhanced 
permeability such as that observed in erg6 mutants. In 

preferred embodiments, a known cytochrome P450 reductase 
related electron-transfer protein inhibitor such as ketoconazole, 

miconazole, dinaconazole or econazole is employed 
as a positive control. Preferred embodiments 

employ solidified media, and test samples are applied to 
disks or wells. Actives are identified by the production 

of a zone differential of approximately 8 mm or greater on 
the yeast culture lawns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screening method for the
identification of potential fungicides, based upon use of
yeast strains defective in ergosterol biosynthesis.Ergosterol is the principal membrane sterol of fungi.
It is structurally similar to its animal counterpart, cholesterol,
except that ergosterol has a methyl group and
two double bonds not present in cholesterol. In yeast,
ergosterol affects membrane fluidity and permeability and
plays an essential role in the yeast cell cycle. Yeast
cells can take up cholesterol and decrease their requirement
for ergosterol to very low levels, but cholesterol
alone cannot completely substitute for ergosterol (Gaber,
R.F., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9: 3447-3456 (1989)).Though sterol biosynthesis in different organisms
have many common steps, the biosynthesis of ergosterol
involves steps distinct from cholesterol biosynthesis.
These occur after ring formation from squalene, in the
transformation of lanosterol to other sterols. One such
step is sterol methylation at position 24 in the ergosterol
biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme S-adenosylmethionine:Δ24-sterol-C-methyl
transferase is responsible for
the alkylation. The ERG6 gene encoding this enzyme has 
been cloned and found to be not essential for growth, but
erg6 mutants lacked normal membrane function (Gaber, et
al., cited above, and McCammon, M.T., et al., J. Bact.
157: 475-483 (1984)).Another enzyme unique to ergosterol biosynthesis is
sterol A22 desaturase, which catalyzes the desaturation of
ergosta-5,7-dien-3-beta-ol, forming a double bond in ergosterol
between carbons at positions 22 and 23 that are
not present in cholesterol. This appears to be catalyzed
by a cytochrome P450 (Hata, S., et al., Biochem. Biophys.
Res. Com. 116: 162-166 (1983)).The term "cytochrome P450" is a trivial name for a
class of cytochromes that includes a number of heme proteins
that have a characteristic absorption maximum at 450
nm when combined with CO in the reduced state ('P' denotes
pigment; hence, the name). These cytochromes occur in
many animal tissues, plants and microorganisms and catalyze
the monooxygenation of a vast variety of hydrophobic
substances including lipophilic endogenous compounds and
xenobiotics, serving as oxygenating catalysts in the
presence of one or more electron-transfer proteins or
redox enzymes. These cytochromes act in concert with a
reductase, a flavoprotein that serves as an electron-transfer
enzyme from NADPH to cytochrome P450.A second cytochrome P450 implicated in the ergosterol

A method for screening for the presence or absence
of inhibition of cytochrome P450 reductase or cytochrome

P450 reductase related enzymes or electron-transfer
proteins by a test sample which comprises:


(a) adding said test sample to a culture of a

Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 strain having a disrupted
cytochrome P450 reductase gene;
(b) adding said test sample to a second culture of
a 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 strain having an erg6
mutation;
(c) incubating said test samples in said cultures

yeast cell growth in corresponding cultures containing
no test sample;
(d) comparing the extent of growth inhibition in
the culture containing the disrupted P450 reductase gene

with the extent of growth inhibition in the culture
containing the erg6 mutant; and
(e) determining the presence of said cytochrome
P450 reductase or cytochrome P450 reductase related

enzymes or electron-transfer proteins inhibition by
observation of whether growth inhibition in the disrupted

reductase growth culture exceeds growth inhibition in the
erg6 culture.

step of providing a control by adding a known inhibitor

of a cytochrome P450 reductase-related electron transfer
protein or enzyme to both

presence of inhibition of said cytochrome P450 or

cytochrome P450 reductase is determined by observation
that growth inhibition in th

the erg6 culture by at least 8mm.
