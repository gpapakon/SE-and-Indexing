<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic random access memory device enters into a 
self-refresh mode in response to a CAS-before-RAS sequence, 

and a controller (29) incorporated in the dynamic random 
access memory device deactivates a column addressing system 

(24) and a data output system (30/26a) in the self-refresh 
mode for decreasing a current consumption, wherein the 

controller (29) is responsive to an external test control 
signal (Ptest) for temporally activating the column 

addressing system and the data output system, and a self-refresh 
cycle time is directly measured at a data output 

pin (I/O).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dynamic random access
memory device and, more particularly, to a dynamic random
access memory device with a CAS(Column Address Strobe
signal)-before-RAS(Row Address Strobe signal) self-refreshing
mode.A typical example of a refresh controlling system
incorporated in the dynamic random access memory device is
illustrated in Fig. 1 of the drawings, and is associated
with a timing controlling system 1 also incorporated in the
dynamic random access memory device. The dynamic random
access memory device selectively enters into a self-refreshing
mode for refreshing stored data bits and into a
standard data access mode for a write-in and a read-out.The refresh controlling system 2 comprises a
discriminator 2a for entry into a self-refresh and a
controller 2b for the self-refresh. The discriminator 2a
and the controller 2b cooperate with a controller 1a for a
row addressing, a controller 1b for a column addressing and
a controller 1c for a sense amplification, and these 
controllers 1a to 1c form parts of the timing controlling
system 1.A row address strobe signal RAS is supplied in
parallel to the discriminator 2a and the controller 1a, and
a column address strobe signal CAS is supplied in parallel
to the discriminator 2a and the controller 1b. In the
standard data access mode, the row address strobe signal
RAS is decayed to an active low level earlier than the
column address strobe signal CAS. On the other hand, in
order to enter into the self-refreshing mode, the column
address strobe signal CAS is firstly decayed to the active
low level, and the row address strobe signal RAS follows
the column address strobe signal CAS.Fig. 2 shows a self-refreshing sequence of the prior
art dynamic random access memory device, and the self-refreshing
sequence is hereinbelow described with coreference
to Figs. 1 and 2. Assuming now that the column
address strobe signal CAS and the row address strobe signal
RAS sequentially go down to the active low level at time t1
and time t2, the discriminator 2a acknowledges the request
for the self-refresh, and controls a self-refresh sequence
with control signals CTL1 and CTL2.Namely, the discriminator 2a supplies the control 
signal CTL1 to the controller 2b, and the controller 2b
starts an internal timer to time a self-refresh entry
period T1.The discriminator 2a shifts the control signal CTL2
to the low level at time t3, and keeps the control signal
CTL2 in the low level in the self-refresh entry period T1.
The control signal CTL2 is supplied to the
