<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
apparatus for guiding the believer to prayer.More specifically, it relates to an
apparatus for guiding to the saying and meditation
of the rosary.As is known, the rosary is a prayer in the
honour of the Virgin Mary that consists in saying a
hundred and fifty Hail Mary, divided in fifteen tens
intercalated with the saying of the Lord's Prayer
and the Gloria. At each ten one keeps meditating on
one of the fifteen Mysteries of Redemption. These
consist in events of Gospel history and are divided
in three series regarding Jesus' and Mary's Joy
(Joyful Mysteries), Sorrow (Sorrowful Mysteries) and
Gloria (Glorious Mysteries).The Joyful Mysteries are the Annunciation,
the Visitation, Jesus' birth, the Virgin's
Purification, Jesus's finding among the Scribes. The
Sorrowful Mysteries are the Agony, the Flagellation,
the Crowning with thorns, the Trip to the Calvary,
the Crucifixion and death. The Glorious Mysteries
are Jesus' Resurrection, the Ascension to Heaven,
the descent of the Holy Ghost, Mary's Assumption,
her Crowning.The essence and the merit of this prayer
are in joining mental prayer and vocal prayer
together.As far back as antiquity and in the most
disparate cultures, besides prayer books means for 
assisting the believer in the prayer are known. For
instance there are plates bearing series of images,
each one associated with a different step of a
prayer.In the saying of the Rosary, due to its
complexity relative, to other prayers, a means was
created and is still commonly used at the present
day - particularly portable for the personal use in
any place - for counting the Hail Mary and the
Lord's Prayer, made up of a crown chain wherein
groups of ten beads or minor grain, which serve for
the Hail Mary, are fixed, each one intercalated with
a bead or major grain, which serves for the Lord's
Prayer.This crown is itself named rosary for
metonymy. It represents, with its grains, the third
part of the rosary, the saying of three Hail Mary
corresponding with each grain. The rosary in a
reduced form can also be said limitedly to sucha
third part, it also commonly named rosary, in which
case a single Hall Mary corresponds with each grain. In order to provide a Rosary that overcomes an
inconvenience or impossibility in manipulating rosary
beads, and in which the prayer step recited the last is
memorized, United States Patent No. 4,601,584 (referred
to as D1 hereinafter), issued to DeWolf et al. on July
22, 1986, teaches an electrically energizable rosary
apparatus having a

An electrically energizable rosary
apparatus, having means for turning it on/off,


characterized in that it includes in
combination:
presentation means (7; 17, 17') for presenting
a message self-explicatorily identifying a step of

Rosary's prayer, for guiding a believer to the saying of
a step of Rosary's prayer;
memory means (3, 4) for storing Rosary's prayer
step-identifying messages, each one for a respective

Rosary's prayer step, for all the steps of Rosary's
prayer;
key means (5, 6; 15, 16), manually controllable
by a believer, for advancing the presentation of said

Rosary's step-identifying messages, and
microprocessor means (2), operatively connected
with said presentation means, memory means and key means,

programmed for making said presentation means to present
said Rosary's prayer step-identifying messages

sequentially, according to the order of the steps of
Rosary's prayer, under succesive activations of said key

means by the believer, fetching them from said memory
means.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 1, further including a random access

memory for the nonvolatile storage of a Rosary's prayer
step-identifying message presented the last before the

apparatus itself is turned off,

said microprocessor means (2) being so
programmed that when the apparatus is turned on again, it 

makes said presentation means to present this rosary's
prayer step-identifying message the first.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 1,
 
wherein said presentation means are made up of

a video display (7).
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 1,

wherein said presentation means are made up of
a vocal synthesizer.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 3,

wherein said video display is an alphanumerical
display.

apparatus of Claim 5, wherein said alphanumerical display

is a liquid crystal display.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 3,

wherein said video display is a graphical
display.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 1,

further including

a group of ten light emitting diodes (17) for
indicating the ten Hail Mary and other three light

emitting diodes (17') for indicating the group of
Mysteries at their turning on, under the control of said

microprocessor means.
The electrically energizable rosary
apparatus of Claim 1,


further including means for emitting musical
religious motives accompanying the various single steps

of rosary's prayer, controlled by said microprocessor
means.
