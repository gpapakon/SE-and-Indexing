<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic relay having movable contactors (12) 
which extend along either side of a movable armature (11). 

The movable armature (11) and the movable contactors (12) are 
formed integrally with the central support member by 

outsert molding. Movable contact terminals (14), which extend 
from the movable contactors, are molded to the base 

sections. Connecting pieces (14A), which are located on the 
bases of the movable contact terminals, are bent to form 

a rotating shaft. The front ends of the base sections 
protrude toward each other to form the base (20). The movable 

contacts on the movable contactors (12) are positioned so that 
they alternately contact and draw away from the fixed 

contacts (15A,16A) on the base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic relay.
More specifically, it concerns a miniature
electromagnetic relay commonly know as a chip relay, ie
integrated into a DIL or DIP package.An example of an electromagnetic relay according to the preamble
of claim 1 is disclosed in EP-A- 0 239 199.A further example of an existing miniature electromagnetic
relay is shown in Fig. 19. This relay consists of a box-shaped
base 2, an electromagnetic block 4, a movable
block 6, and a box-shaped case 7. Base 2 has a number of
terminals molded onto it: common terminal 1a, fixed
contact terminals 1b, and coil terminals 1c. Permanent
magnet 3b is held in place by U-shaped iron core 3a.
Coil 3d is wound around molded bobbin 3c, and the ends of
the coil are tied and welded to studs 3f on lug terminal
strips 3e. The bobbin is then mounted onto the base.
Electromagnetic block 4 is formed as an integral unit by
welding the lug terminal strips 3e to connection points
1d on coil terminals 1c located on the bottom of box-shaped
base 2. (The connection point on the front of the
base is note shown.)
Electromagnetic block 4 is joined with support member 5c
which supports movable contactors 5b at their centers.
The movable contactors are disposed lengthwise along
either side of movable armature 5a. Movable block 6 is
formed as an integral unit by welding connectors 5d,
which are formed as extensions from the centers of
movable contactors 5b, to connection points le on common
terminal la. Box-shaped case 7 has dimensions such that
it can engage with the box-shaped base 2. The
electromagnetic relay described above has a number of
disadvantages. In the electromagnetic relay described above,
connectors 5d on movable block 6 are welded to connection
points 1e. The welding process has been considered
essential. Since working space must be provided in and
around the welding points, it is difficult to reduce the
size of the device.If the relay is to be made smaller, the welding
points must be made smaller, which makes the task of
welding significantly more difficult, and reduces
production efficiency.Another disadvantage of the electromagnetic relay
described above is that because impurities such as carbon
are generated during the welding process, a defective
contact may occur. Also, variations in the welding
process may lead to aberrations in the operating
characteristics.Further, since the relay described above has four
independent structural components, it requires a large
number of components and a large number of assembly
processes.
