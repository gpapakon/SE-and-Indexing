<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for rapidly collecting kinetic rate data from a temperature scanning reactor for chemical reactions. The method, which is particularly useful for studying catalytic reactions, involves ramping (scanning) of the input temperature to a reactor and recording of output conversion and bed temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus
for determining rates of reaction in a chemical reactor
system.The acquisition of kinetic rate data from a
chemical reaction system is usually a laborious, time
consuming and expensive undertaking. As a consequence,
evaluation of catalysts and reaction conditions, in the
chemical industry, for example, is often carried out with
scanty data which does not allow for a full understanding of
the system under study. Conventional methods generally
include collecting iso-thermal conversion data at steady
state for a number of feed rates. Because of operating
requirements, such as waiting for steady state, start-up,
shutdown etc., it is usually only possible to make 1-5 runs
per day in any given system. At least 30 runs are needed
over a range of 3 or 4 temperatures. About 8-10 space
velocities are required at each temperature, and hence it
will be seen that such a study will take about two months to
complete. This time period may be considerably increased if
repeat runs are required to verify catalyst stability over
this length of time or to obtain a statistical measure of 
variance or if feed composition of reactant concentration are
to be varied. Frequently, therefore, there may be as much as
one person-year required for a full research study. There is,
therefore, a considerable need for an improved method of
acquiring kinetic rate data for chemical reactors.
Catal. Rev. -Sci.Eng., 25(2), 141-227 (1983) discloses
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed
reaction (TPR) techniques for obtaining kinetic data
using a stream swept reactor.An object of the present invention is to provide a method
for determining kinetic rate data for chemical reactors which
is at least an order of magnitude faster than conventional
methods.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
improved apparatus for carrying out kinetic rate determinations
for chemical reactions.Thus, by one aspect of this invention there is provided
a method for rapid collection of kinetic rate data from a
temperature scanning reactor selected from the group consisting
of a plug flow reactor, an adiabatic reactor, a batch reactor,
and a continuous stirred tank reactor, in which a feed stock
is reacted under non-steady state conditions to form a
conversion product comprising, 
ramping the input temperature of said feed stock rapidly
over a selected range of temperature,continuously monitoring output conversion and output
temperature and determining a rate of reaction
