<ABSTRACT>
Electronic control device ST for a motor vehicle, with automatic recognition of one of two possible numbers of teeth Z1, Z2 of the generator wheel GR used in the speed sensor V connected (dependent on differences in the equipment of the vehicle). The number of teeth Z1 is recognised if the ratio n/v of the engine speed n [rpm] to the peripheral speed of the wheel v [km/h]
 is greater than a specified threshold value S. The number of teeth Z2 = 2*Z1 is recognised if the ratio n/v is smaller than the specified threshold value S.

<CLAIMS>
Motor vehicle having a drive engine (M), a clutch 
(K) and a clutch detection device (KE) which, when the 

clutch (K) is engaged, emits a clutch signal (k), having 
a gearbox (G) and at least one driven wheel (R), an 

engine speed sensor (N), at least one speed sensor (V) 
for determining the speed (v) of the vehicle or the 

gearbox output speed, which speed sensor (V) is provided 
with a pickup wheel (GR) having either a specific first 

number of teeth (Z1) or a specific second number of teeth 
(Z2), and having an electronic control device (ST), which 

has an arithmetic circuit (RS) which determines the ratio 
(n/v) of the engine speed (n) to the speed (v) of the 

vehicle or gearbox output speed, and has a comparator (C) 
which compares the ratio (n/v) with a prescribed 

threshold value (S), characterized in that the comparator 
(C) emits a first output signal (
A
), which is assigned to 
the pickup wheel (GR) with the first specific number of 

teeth (Z1), if the ratio (n/v) is greater than the 
threshold value (S), and emits a second output signal 

(A), which is assigned to the pickup wheel (GR) with the 
second specific number of teeth (Z2), if the ratio (n/v) 

is smaller than the threshold value (S), in that a memory 
(SP) is provided which, when the battery is connected to 

the vehicle, is set to the first output signal (
A
), and 
the memory contents of which memory (SP) are changed, in 

a non-volatile fashion, into the second output signal (A) 
if a clutch signal (k) is present at the same time as the 

second output signal (A), and in that the number of teeth 
(Z2 or Z1), which is assigned to the output signal (A or 


A
) stored in the memory (SP), of the pickup wheel (GR) is  
 

used to determine the speed (v) of the vehicle or gearbox 
output speed. 
Motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the clutch detection device (KE) emits a clutch 

signal (k) if the engine speed (n) lies within a prescribed 
engine speed window (n1 
<
 n 
<
 n2) and if simultaneously 
the engine load (L) is greater than a prescribed 

load threshold value (L1). 
Motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the second output signal (A) which is emitted by 

the comparator (C) is stored in a non-volatile fashion if 
the said output signal (A) and the clutch signal (k) 

appear simultaneously for the duration of a prescribed 
time (t). 
Motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the second output signal (A) which is emitted by 

the comparator (C) is not stored in a non-volatile 
fashion until the comparator (C) has each time emitted 

the second output signal (A) after a prescribed number 
(w) of repetitions of the determination of the number of 

teeth (Z1, Z2) of the pickup wheel (GR) used. 
Motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the determination of the number of teeth (Z1, Z2) 

of the pickup wheel (GR) used is terminated after non-volatile 
storage of the second output signal (A). 
Motor vehicle according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the functions of the 

arithmetic circuit (RS), of the comparator (C), of the 
clutch detection device (KE), of an engine speed converter 

circuit (WN), of a speed converter circuit (WV), 
of an AND element (AND) and of an OR element (OR) are 

contained in the form of software in the program of the 
control device (ST).
