<ABSTRACT>
A memory device is provided in a tape cassette and 
it consists of a program information area for recording 

information on each program recorded in a tape and a tape 
information area for recording information on the entire tape. 

If this tape cassette is used by a video cassette recorder 
having a full function to drive the memory device and by a 

video cassette recorder having a limited function to drive it, 
the program information recorded in the memory device is 

consistent with the programs recorded actually in the tape. 
For example, a tape erasing prevention flag is recorded in the 

tape information area, while a program erasing prevention flag 
is recorded for each program in the program in the program 

information area. In a different example, a tape inconsistency 
flag is recorded in the tape information area, while a 

program inconsistency flag is recorded for each program in the 
program in the program information area. The data in the 

memory device can be corrected by using such flags according 
to the programs recorded actually in the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
recording data with a tape cassette including a memory.
Description of the Prior ArtRecently, video cassette recorders and audio
cassette recorders for recording a tape cassette are popular
in many homes. However, they have problems on operation,
search and the like when compared with apparatuses using a
disk medium. Then, it is demanded for example to facilitate
management and search on recorded programs. WO-A-93/04473 teaches to provide a directory of programs to be recorded on a cassette
tape of e.g. a video tape cassette in order to facilitate recording and reviewing of the
programs and allocating and deallocating of space on the tape. The directory is either
stored on the cassette tape itself or on an external memory.Furthermore, a bar code is already available to manage data recorded in a cassette tape
for a video cassette recorder. That is, a bar code is attached to a video tape in order to
discriminate a tape cassete in order to represent recorded programs. The bar code is
read by a sensor installed in a video cassette recorder and read data are stored in a
memory also installed in the recorder Then, recorded programs in a tape cassette can
be managed by referring the data in the memory. However, this management system has
a problem that there is no compatibility between video cassette recorders. BE-A-191395 and 191469
disclose a cassette
tape recorder for a tape cassette having a memory device
therein. When such a tape cassette is inserted in a cassette
tape recorder, the memory device is connected to a controller
of the recorder. The recorder has a detector which can detect
a tape position and stores an instantaneous tape position in
the memory device when a cassette tape stops. The memory
device comprises memory element blocks each for storing a
plurality of tape positions. Then, the recorder can manage
tape position data stored in the memory device. Therefore,
the cassette tape can be used in any cassette tape recorder
which has a device to use such a cassette tape.Such a tape cassette may be set in a tape recorder
which cannot use the memory device. In such a case, the
Belgian patents disclosed that the cassette tape itself erases
all data stored in the memory device and displays a warning
message. However, it is desirable that recording and
reproduction are possible by protecting data stored in a
memory device in such a tape cassette as much as possible even
when it is used to be recorded by a tape recorder which cannot
use such a memory
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A recording apparatus which records a program and a time data and uses a
tape cassette (7) wherein a memory device (5) is provided, which memory device

(5) having a program information area (64a, 64b, 64c) for storing information
related to programs recorded in a tape (4) in the tape cassette (7) and a tape

information area (60) for storing information related to the tape (4), the program
information area (64a, 64b, 64c) including an area for storing for each of recorded programs a program inconsistency

flag (66) which is reset or set for each of the recorded programs according to
whether or not a content of a program recorded in the tape coincides with the information on

the program stored in the memory device, the tape information area (60) including an
area for storing a tape inconsistency flag (63) which is set or reset according to

whether or not the content recorded actually in the entire tape (4) is inconsistent
with the program i
nformation in the memory device (5), which recording apparatus
comprising:


a memory write means (108) for writing tape information and program information
to the memory device (5) provided in the tape cassette (7);
a memory read means (109) for reading tape information and program information
from the memory device (5);
a detection means (115) for detecting the tape inconsistency flag (63) in said
memory device (5) by way of said memory read means (109);
a setting means (114) for setting the program inconsistency flags (66) in the
program information area (64a, 64b, 64c) for each recorded program by way of

said memory write means (108) when said detection means (115) detects that the
tape inconsistency flag (63) is set; and 
a resetting means (107) for resetting the tape inconsistency flag (63) in the tape
information area (60) by way of said memory write means (108) after said setting

means (114) sets the program inconsistency flag (66) in the program information
area (64a, 64b, 64c).
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:

an overwrite detection means (112) for reading program information from the
program information area (64a, 64b, 64c) by way of said memory read means

(109), for detecting according to time data on the tape (4) if a program described
in the program information is recorded at a recording position in correspondence to

the program information, and for deciding that an overwrite occurs if it is decided that
the program is not recorded at the recording position;
a data correction means (105) for correcting the program information in the program
information area (64a, 64b, 64c) for a program, on which overwrite is

decided to occur by said overwrite detection means (112), as recorded actually in
the tape (4), according to time data on programs already recorded or a current

program to be recorded in the tape (4); and
a resetting means (106) for resetting the program inconsistency flag (66) for each
recorded program after said data correction means (105) corrects the program

information in the program information area (64a, 64b, 64c).
