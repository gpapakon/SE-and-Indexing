<ABSTRACT>
A feed device for headed fasteners, e.g. tacks, 
nails and the like, comprises a plurality of raceways 

(406), a separator device (408) comprising a separator 
bar arrangement movable transversely of the outlet ends 

of the raceways (406), and a collector arrangement (422) 
disposed beneath the separator device (408) and having a 

plurality of openings for receiving transferred 
fasteners. For facilitating variation of the number of 

fasteners to be separated and fed, the bar arrangement 
comprises two cooperating but independently operated 

slide bars (410,412) for picking off leading fasteners 
from outlet ends of the raceways (406) and supplying the 

thus picked off fasteners to apertures (420) for onward 
supply to a desired location, e.g. tacker units (300) of 

a heel seat and side lasting machine for use in the 
manufacture of shoes. By reason of the independent 

operation of the slide bars (410,412), the number of 
fasteners supplied can thus be varied. If desired, the 

control of the operation of the slide bars can be by 
electronic control means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a feed device 
for headed fasteners, e.g. tacks, nails and the like, 
especially, but not exclusively, for use in a heel seat 
lasting machine, and also with heel seat lasting machines 
incorporating a feed device for headed fasteners. One feed device for headed fasteners is 
currently supplied on commercially available heel seat 
and side and heel seat lasting machines supplied by the 
Applicants and comprises a feed device for headed 
fasteners, e.g. tacks, nails and the like, comprising a 
plurality of raceways along each of which headed 
fasteners can pass, supported by the heads thereof, from 
a supply to an outlet end, a separator device comprising 
a bar arrangement movable between first and second 
positions transversely of the outlet ends of the raceways 
and provided with a plurality of recesses, each 
associated with one of the raceways, for receiving a 
headed fastener, the arrangement being such that by 
moving the bar arrangement between its first and second 
positions each recess is moved past the outlet end of its 
associated raceway and the leading headed fastener at 
said outlet end is transferred to the recess, together 
with drive means for effecting movement of the bar 
arrangement between said positions, and a collector 
arrangement disposed beneath the separator device and 
having a plurality of openings, one associated with each 
recess, for receiving the transferred fastener from its 
associated recess, when the bar arrangement is moved as 
aforesaid, from which opening the fastener can then be 
supplied to a desired location. More particularly, in 
the commercially available device a maximum number of 
headed fasteners which can be supplied in a cycle of 
operation of the machine is twenty-two, and in cases  
 
where less than twenty-two are required (and 
conventionally in some instances, according to the style 
and/or size of the shoe to be lasted, eighteen or indeed 
fourteen fasteners are required), it is necessary for the 
operator to cause certain of the raceways to be blocked 
off, thus to prevent the supply of fasteners where they 
are not required. Whereas when a lasting machine using such a 
feed device has a dedicated operator, the operation of 
blocking of the raceways, even though time-consuming, can 
be readily accommodated as part of the work of the 
operator. In cases where a more automated process is 
being utilised, e.g. which will dispense completely with 
an operator for the lasting machine, or indeed where the 
operator

plurality of positions to bring a selected set of 
openings into alignment with the recesses of the bar 

arrangement thus to receive the transferred fasteners 
therefrom into the selected openings when the bar
