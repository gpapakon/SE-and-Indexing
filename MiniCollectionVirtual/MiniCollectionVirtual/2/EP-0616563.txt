<DESCRIPTION>
 PASTE. INK OR CREAM FORMULATIONS FOR USE IN THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRYThe present invention relates to paste, ink or cream formulations for use in the electronics industry and, in particular, to solder paste formulations which are reflowable in air with low residues.Vehicles which are commonly used in the preparation of pastes for the electronics industry contain a volatile solvent, a thickener/ binder, a rheological modifier to enhance thixotropy or pseudoplasticity, a surfactant and, optionally, an activating or reducing agent. In particular, reducing or fluxing agents may be used where surface preparation or fluxing is necessary. The level of non-volatile organic solids to provide the desired viscosity is normally from 40 to 75wt%. The materials used are either polymeric materials, such as ethyl cellulose or derivatives thereof, polyamides or castor oil derivatives. There is a trend in the electronics industry towards the automated manufacture of printed circuit boards (pcb's) , where residues after a soldering operation are required to be minimal, and a subsequent cleaning operation is obviated. The solids content of the vehicle/flux for conventional solder pastes used in pcb manufacture is typically 40 to 80wt% and much of this will remain after solder reflow, requiring a cleaning operation. Furthermore some solder paste vehicles with a high solids content have poor hot slump characteristics; this can lead to solder powder being washed away from the printed circuit pad during reflow. Discrete solder balls are then produced and these may lead to short circuits.Accordingly, the present invention provides a 

 paste, ink or cream for use in the electronics industry which comprises i) a particulate filler material, and ii) a vehicle which is an emulsion of a) a polar organic solvent, or a mixture thereof, and b) an aliphatic hydrocarbon, or a mixture thereof, the component forming either the disperse phase or continuous phase of the emulsion including therein at least one thermally depolymerisable polymer which decomposes to volatile or gaseous products at a temperature of below 350°C and leaves a residue level of less than 5% based on the weight of the polymer. Preferably the thermally depolymerisable polymer is incorporated into the disperse phase of the emulsion vehicle in the form of a gel. This gelation may further improve the stability of the emulsion vehicle by preventing coalescence of disperse phase droplets. Alternatively, although not preferred, the thermally depolymerisable polymer may be
