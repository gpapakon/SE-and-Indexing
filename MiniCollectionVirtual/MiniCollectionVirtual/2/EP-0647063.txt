<ABSTRACT>
A video processing system (10) is provided that comprises an image 
sensor image area (14) that operates to transfer an image to an image 

memory (18) to be processed by a video processor (16). The exposure time 
of the image is controlled by an iris controller (24) 

in a more linear fashion. 
An IMAGE CLEAR signal is juxtaposed with an IMAGE 

TRANSFER signal to set the length of the exposure. The IMAGE CLEAR 
signal is generated by an iris counter (36) and an iris signal decoder (34). 

The maximum count used by the iris counter (36) is set using a count length 
set circuit (38) which receives command signals generated by monitoring the 

video output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic systems and 
more particularly to an improved video processing system. Electronic iris controllers have been developed to eliminate the need 
for or supplement a mechanical iris to control the amount of light that 
impinges on a solid state electronic image sensor. An electronic iris controls 
the exposure time by periodically exposing or removing the charge generated 
by the photon-generated hole-electron pairs within the image sensor. This 
process of periodic destruction or removal of charge is referred to as the 
clearing of the image sensor. The charge is also removed from the image 
sensor when the signal from the image sensor is transferred to an image 
memory associated with the image sensor. This process is referred to as the 
image transfer. The length of time between the clearing of the image and the 
transfer of the image sets the electronic exposure time. By altering the 
relative positions of the image clear operation and the image transfer 
operation, the length of exposure time can be controlled electronically. The image memory is capacitively coupled to the image sensor. 
Accordingly, during the readout of information from the image memory, no 
other operations are performed on the image sensor or the image memory to 
minimize interference with the readout sequence. For most television 
applications, the maximum exposure time for a field of data is 16.67 
milliseconds. A typical field of television data comprises 262.5 lines of 
information. This sets the minimum exposure at 63.5 microseconds for 
operations during the readout of the image memory, due to the fact that all  
 
image clear or image transfer operations must occur during 
the horizontal blanking period or vertical blanking period. 
Iris control has typically been limited to exposure 
adjustments in 63.5 microseconds increments only. This 
incremental change of exposure time creates a problem in that 
the percentage change of exposure is extremely non-linear in 
that the initial incremental changes are very small compared 
to the entire 16.67 millisecond field time and the final 
incremental changes can result in exposure changes up to and 
including fifty percent. US-A-5,040,070 discloses a CCD image sensor wherein the 
timing to discharge the charges stored in a light receiving 
portion is set in accordance with an exposure state of the 
CCD, so that an exposure period is shortened and expanded.
