<DESCRIPTION>
Process for the preparation of 4-pyridyl- and 4-piperidiny.imidazoles useful as intermediates for the synthesis of histamine receptor antagonists1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of intermediates useful in the synthesis of histamine receptor antagonists, in particular histamine H3-receptor antagonists.102. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Histamine receptor pharmacology has revealed three subtypes of receptors which mediate (or are associated with) the activity of histamine. These 15 receptors are most commonly referred to as H,, H2, and H3. The most recently discovered of these receptors is the H3-histamine receptor. Early studies suggested the presence of another histamine receptor when it was demonstrated that histamine inhibits its own synthesis20 and release in brain slices by a negative feedback process operating at the level of histaminergic nerve- endings (see, for example, Arrang, J.M. et al . Nature 102:832-837 (1983)). More recently, the H3-receptor has been shown to function as a pre-synaptic25 autoreceptor inhibiting histamine synthesis and histamine release from neurons, especially in the control nervous system (Arrang, et al . Nature 327:117- 123 (1987)). The presence of H3-receptors in peripheral tissues has also been reported and here too30 they appear to be involved with the nervous system. Thus, histamine depresses sympathetic neurotrans- mission in the guinea pig mesenteric artery by interacting with H3-receptors on the perivascular nerve terminals (Ishikawa and Sperelakis, Nature 327:15835 (1987)). This important observation suggests that histamine may control the release of other 

neurotransmitters (Ta ura et al . , Neuroscience 25:171 (1988)). Inhibitory histamine H3-receptors also exist in the guinea pig ileum where their role appears to be to modify the magnitude of histamine contraction, rather than af ecting histamine release (Trzeciakowski, J". Pharmacol . Exp. Therapy 243:847 (1987)). Particularly intriguing is the discovery of H3-receptors in the lung (Arrang et al . Nature 327: 117-123 (1987)). The presence of histamineH3-receptors in the lung raises the question of whether they control histamine release in anaphylaxis and whether they may-be manipulated to provide therapy in asthma. Indeed it has been suggested that H3-receptors may have a modulating role on excitatory neurotransmission in airways. Generally, however, H3- receptor inhibition tends to increase histamine activity, with potentially detrimental effects.
