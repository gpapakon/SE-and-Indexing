<DESCRIPTION>
 Pyridine derivatives, their preparation and use as medicinesThe present invention relates to novel substituted amidine derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in therapy, in particular as gastric acid secretion inhibitors.The present invention, therefore, provides compounds of structure (I):in which:Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring;2 Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring;R is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl;2 R is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl;3 R is hydrogen or Cj^alkyl;4 R is hydrogen, halogen, C^alkyl or Ci.galkoxy,X is CH2 or NR5, andR5 is hydrogen or Ci^alkyl, and the salts thereof.Suitably, Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring.Suitable substituents for the phenyl ring Ar include, for example, Cj.galkyl, Cι_6alkoxy, Ci.galkylthio, halogen, nitro, cyano, amino, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, Cι_6alkanoyl, trifluoromethyl and Cι_4_lkylenedioxy substituents such as methylenedioxy (-OCH2O-). The phenyl rings may be substituted by a single substituent, or up to five substituents as may be synthetically accessible (for example, 2,3,4,5,6-penta- fluorophenyl). Preferably, the group Ar is unsubstituted phenyl, or phenyl substituted by 1 or more substituents selected from Cj.galkyl, Cj.galkoxy, C^alkylthio, halogen, cyano, amino, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, Cj^alkanoyl, trifluoromethyl or by a single substituent in association with a Cι_4alkylenedioxy. The phenyl ring may be substituted 

by a single substituent or up to 5 substituents as may be synthetically accessible (for example, 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl). More preferably, Ar is unsubstituted. phenyl, or phenyl substituted by one or two substituents selected from C^galkyl, Ci.galkoxy and halogen. Most preferably Ar is unsubstituted phenyl or a phenyl group substituted by a single C^aH yl or halogen (in particular in the 2-position of the ring), or phenyl substituted by 2 halogen atoms (in particular 2 chlorine or fluorine atoms in the 2- and 6- positions of the ring or a chlorine atom in the 2-position and a fluorine atom in the 6- position of the ring).Suitably R is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl; preferably R is hydrogen.Suitably, R 2 is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl; preferably R 2 is hydrogen.Suitably, R 3 is hydrogen or C1.4a.kyl; preferably R 3 is hydrogen.Suitably, R is hydrogen, halogen, Cj.βalkyl or Cι_6alkoxy; preferably R is hydrogen.2 Suitably, Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring.Suitable substituents for the phenyl ring Ar^ include, for example, Ci.galkyl, Cj.galkoxy,
