<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for frequency band reduction of a voice signal having an upper and lower band limit including a voice signal input. A clipping circuit (2) clips the positive and negative peaks of the voice signal connected to the voice signal input. A bandpass filter (3) is connected to the clipping circuit for rejecting harmonics created by the clipping circuit. A low and high end roll-off filter device is provided for producing a given db/octave frequency roll off at the lower bandlimit. The geometric mean value of the upper and lower bandlimit falls within a given lower and a given upper frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR VOICE BAND REDUCTIONThis application is based on Patent Application 680,035 filed March 28, 1991, which is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application 325,239 filed March 16, 1989.TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to an apparatus and method for frequency band reduction of a voice signal, and more particularly to frequency band reduction by means of clipping the peaks of a voice signal and rejecting the harmonics created by the clipping, by means of a bandpass filter having special characteristics. As a result, the average voice energy level is increased, leading to increased noise reduction and savings in frequency band use.BACKGROUND Voice band reduction is desirable because it increases the number of voice channels within a frequency band of a given width. Unlike the prior art, the invention is applied on a broad band basis and the harmonics created in the clipping process are eliminated by means of suitable filtering.It is an object of the invention to provide frequency band reduction of a voice signal having a given original bandwidth without significant loss of voice signal quality and speaker recognition.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a voice signal clipping circuit that clips the positive and negative peaks of the voice signal, followed by a bandpass filter having upper and lower bandlimits such that the square root of the product of the bandlimits falls within a range of 650 and 900 Hz and both the low and high end of the band has a roll-off of preferably 6 db/octave. The geometric mean value of the bandlimit frequencies is within range of preferably, but not necessarily 650-900 Hz.The bandpass filter removes the harmonics created by the clipping process, which would otherwise lead to sever distortion of the voice signal.A low and high end roll-off at a rate of approximately 6 db/octave is necessary to maintain an acceptable voice signal quality. Without the roll-off, the clipping'
and bandpass filtering causes the signal to sound hollow and causes a loss of speaker recognition. The low and high end roll is necessary to obtain the desired frequency band reduction.The clipping of the peaks of the voice signal causes an evening-out of the variations in the signal energy of the voice signal. The human voice is modulated such that the root-mean-square value of the voice energy constantly fluctuates within a wide range during conversation, resulting in a low energy level. The peak energy level of most transmission apparatus is limited to a given upper
