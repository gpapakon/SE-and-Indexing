<ABSTRACT>
In a processing cartridge (1), photoconductor drum (11) is 
driven by a gear (3) which is in the printer, while 

toner adder roller (48) is driven independently by a 
face coupling (5) which is in the printer. On the 

opposite side, a gear train from toner adder roller (48) 
drives developer roller (42) and toner paddle (52). The 

two systems permit the cartridge to function in 
different printers requiring different ratios of speeds. 

Stiffness requirements of the cartridge are reduced. 
Movements are more consistent, and space utilization is 

enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic replaceable cartridge for
electrophotographic imaging, containing toner, toner
applicating elements and a photoconductor. Such
cartridges typically have moving systems which are
driven from the imaging device in which they are
installed. This invention is directed to such a
cartridge having improved moving systems.The internal elements of the cartridge of this invention
and associated external configuration may take the form
described in EP-A-0,613,063.Typically, a replaceable cartridge containing toner is
driven from a single gear or rotatable face coupling.
US-A-5,053,817 to Ogiri et al is illustrative of such a
cartridge having systems driven from a gear. US-A-5,023,660
to Ebata et al is illustrative of such a
cartridge having systems driven by a face coupling.With single driven systems, such a cartridge will have a
constant ratio of movement with respect to all of the
moving elements. Printers which differ by the ratio of
movement of the photoconductor and the developer roller
require different cartridges or, as shown in US-A-5,126,800
to Shishido et al, different moving elements
within the same cartridge, which may not be practical or
efficient.Also, when all elements are driven from the same source,
power from the source must be large enough to service
all the elements and that power must be translated
through gears or other couplings to all of the elements.
Couplings such as gears within the cartridge introduce
disruptions such that the elements do not all move
simultaneously at the theoretical speed, but instead
exhibit jitter and some discontinuous actions. A replaceable cartridge for an electrophotographic
apparatus is disclosed in US-A-4,873,549 (over which
claim 1 has been characterised) which is provided with a
coupling for the shaft of a photosensitive drum and a
coupling for the shaft of a developer roller.This invention employs a cartridge in which the
developing system is independently driven from the
imaging device and the photoconductor roller is
independently driven from the imaging device. Changing
the speed ratio very effectively controls the amount of
toner developed on the latent electrostatic image on the
photoconductor drum.Thus according to the invention there is provided an
electrophotographic replaceable cartridge containing an
endless, rotatable photoconductive member, a development
system having at least a rotatable developer roller, a
toner chamber, and a rotatable toner paddle in said
toner chamber, said cartridge having a

<CLAIMS>
An electrophotographic replaceable cartridge (1)
containing an endless, rotatable photoconductive member

(11), a development system having at least a rotatable
developer roller (42), a toner chamber (46), and a

rotatable toner paddle (52) in said toner chamber, said
cartridge having a first coupling (7) for rotating said

photoconductive member by coupling with a driving source (3)
from a printer and a second coupling (13), independent

of said first coupling, for rotating said developer
roller by coupling with a driving source (5) from said

printer, said first and said second couplings being on
one side of said cartridge, characterised in that said

development system further comprises a rotatable member
(48) intermediate said developer roller and said toner

paddle, said second coupling (13) is an integral
extension of said intermediate member (48), and in that

said cartridge further comprises a first linkage (66,62,64)
from said intermediate member to said developer roller

to rotate said developer roller by rotation of said
second coupling and a second linkage (66,68,70,72,74) from said

intermediate member to said toner paddle to rotate said
toner paddle by rotation of said second coupling, said

first linkage and said second linkage being entirely on
the side of said cartridge opposite said one side.
The cartridge of claim 1, in which said second
linkage (66,68,70,72,74) is a speed reduction system.
The cartridge of claim 1 or 2, in which said
intermediate member (48) is a toner adder roller.
