<ABSTRACT>
Treatment with a set of porphyrin compounds using a photodynamic therapy approach is able selectively to lower elevated levels of activated leukocytes in a leukocyte population. By using compounds with absorption maxima of about 670 nm or higher, irradiation wavelengths can be selected to permit treatment of complex tissues, such as whole blood. This is particularly helpful in subjects containing such elevated levels of T-cell subsets, such as HIV-infected subjects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photodynamic methods for
selectively depleting blood or bone marrow of CD8+, DR+ or IL-2R+ cells
important in the progress of certain diseases. More
specifically, it concerns use of a green porphyrin in the
manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of
immune dysfunctional
disorders, such as patients with autoimmune diseases or
patients infected with HIV.Unwanted immune responses, such as those
characterizing autoimmune disease, allograft rejection,
and associated with diseases which affect the immune
system directly are characterized by the presence of
activated leukocytes, in particular activated T-cells.
Various methods to control activated lymphocytes have
been described. For example, U.S. Patent 5,011,684
describes the use of monoclonal antibodies directed to
IL-2 receptors characteristic of activated T-cells to
control allograft rejection and autoimmunity; U.S. Patent
5,152,380 describes similar materials as well as toxin
conjugates to control allergic responses. It is
generally recognized that a marker for activated T-lymphocytes
is the presence of an IL-2 receptor of high
affinity.The immunodisturbances caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been studied, but the
nature of the progress of the disease is still uncertain.
However, it has been shown that HIV-infected humans have
circulating cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that lyse uninfected
CD4+ cells (Zarling, J.M. et al., J Immunol (1990)
144:2992. It is also generally understood that infection
with HIV, while depleting the levels of CD4+ cells,
enhances the levels of CD8+, DR+, and IL-2R+ leukocytes. 
As set forth above, IL-2R+ is considered an activation
marker and DR is an HLA marker, and these may be present
on cells with additional markers such as CD4 and CD8.One approach to interfering with the progress or
this infection and resultant immunosuppression employs
strategies to alter the composition of the blood with
respect to various components of the immune system. In
one attempt to achieve this, U.S. patent 4,960,408
discloses a process of treating a subject having AIDS-related
complex systemically with psoralen, and then
extracorporeally treating the T-lymphocytes with
ultraviolet radiation of a wavelength absorbed by the
psoralen compound. The irradiated T-cells are then
returned. This treatment apparently enhances the levels
of CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ cells, although not in
a uniform fashion.U.S. patent 5,095,030, issued 10 March 1992, which
is incorporated herein in its entirety by
