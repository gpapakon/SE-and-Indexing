<ABSTRACT>
A Zircaloy cladding (104) having an outer region 
comprising fine precipitates (108) and inner region comprising 

coarse precipitates (102) is provided. The outer region comprises 
about 10% and the inner region comprises about 90% of the 

cladding wall thickness. Such Zircaloy tubing is resistant to 
propagation of cracks and at the same time resistant to 

corrosion in boiling water reactors (BWR). Resistance to 
damage caused by the pellet-cladding-interaction can be 

achieved by standard application of a zirconium or zirconium-alloy 
liner on the tubing inside surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Zircaloy cladding for use 
in nuclear fuel elements. More particularly, the invention 
relates to cladding having improved axial crack propagation 
resistance. Nuclear reactors have their fuel contained in sealed 
cladding for the isolation of the nuclear fuel from the 
moderator/coolant system. The term cladding, as used herein, 
refers to a zirconium based alloy tube composed of at least 
one metal in addition to the zirconium base. The term 
precipitates, as used herein, refers to added metals of the 
cladding and forming isolated structures in a matrix 
throughout the zirconium alloy. These precipitates may or may 
not constitute intermetallics. Typically, these precipitates 
are uniformly distributed in the matrix -- although they vary 
in size. Further, so-called fine precipitates (below 0.1 µm 
(microns)), can either be in the matrix format or the so-called 
two dimensional format where the precipitates occupy sheet 
like layer near the outer surface of the zirconium alloy. The cladding -- nominally in the order of 0.076cm (0.030 
inches) thick -- is formed in the shape of a tube with the 
nuclear fuel contained typically in pellet form therein. 
These pellets are stacked in contact with one another for 
almost the entire length of each cladding tube, which cladding 
tube is in the order of 406cm (160 inches) in length. Typically, the 
cladding tube is provided with springs for centering the fuel 
pellets and so-called "getters" for absorbing fission gases. 
Thereafter, the internal portions of the fuel rod are 
pressurized with various gases for optimum dissipation of 
gases produced from the fission reaction, and sealed at both 
ends.  
 Zirconium and its alloys, under normal 
circumstances, are excellent nuclear fuel cladding since they 
have low neutron absorption cross sections and at temperatures 
below about 398° C (at or below the core temperature of the 
operating reactor) are strong, ductile, extremely stable and 
nonreactive in the presence of demineralized water or steam. 
"Zircaloys" are a widely used family of corrosion-resistant 
zirconium alloy cladding materials. The Zircaloys are 
composed of 98-99% by weight zirconium, with the balance being 
tin, iron, chromium, and nickel. "Zircaloy-2" and "Zircdloy-4" 
are two widely-used zirconium-based alloys for cladding. 
(Zircaloy-4 omitting nickel). Cladding corrosion is a potential problem both in 
boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. For 
example, in a PWR, water does not boil -- although
