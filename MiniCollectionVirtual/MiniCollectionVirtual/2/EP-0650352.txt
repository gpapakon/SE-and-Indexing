<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a gelled water/oil/water triple emulsion comprising: (A) a fatty phase comprising at least one wax having a melting point of at least 60  C and forming the primary W/O emulsion with an aqueous phase; (B) a dilution oil; (C) a gelled continuous external aqueous phase comprising at least a gelling agent having a fatty chain of the monoethylene carboxylic acid or acid anhydride copolymer type with 3 to 6 carbon atoms or a fatty chain acrylic ester. In the triple emulsion, the amount of fatty phase from the W/O emulsion is from 1 to 30 % and the amount of wax having a melting point of at least 60  C is from 0.2 to 10 %, based on the total weight of the triple emulsion. Said triple emulsion can be used as a carrier in cosmetic or dermatologically active compositions suitable for use on the skin or hair.
