<ABSTRACT>
In this case, it is provided for a parallelogram linkage to be constructed between the mounting, the vehicle roof and a hatch which can pivot, in order to adjust the mounting from a lowered stowed position into an erected operating position, by means of a pivoting movement of the hatch. In this case, an upper base of the parallel linkage is formed via spaced-apart bearing points on the mounting and a lower base is formed by spaced-apart bearing points on the vehicle roof, which are connected in an articulated manner by connections in the form of a linkage arm and the hatch which can pivot.

<CLAIMS>
Weapons carriage (13) for armoured vehicles which is 
arranged on the vehicle via a slewing ring (3) for the 

purpose of aligning in elevation and direction and is 
capable of being operated through a hatch (4), the 

carriage (13) being automatically adjustable from a 
lowered storage position to a mounted operating position 

by means of a swivelling movement of the hatch (4) into 
its position of opening, characterised in that the 

carriage (13) forms an upper base of a parallelogram via 
spaced bearing points (10,11) and forms a lower base of a 

parallelogram on the vehicle roof (1) in the rotatably 
accommodated part (3) via spaced bearing points (5,8), 

said bases being connected in articulated manner by means 
of links in the form of a linkage arm (7) and the hatch 

(4) which is capable of being swivelled. 
Weapons carriage according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing point (11) of the upper base is formed 

via a bearing pedestal (12) which is firmly connected to 
the hatch (4) and the bearing point (8) is formed on a 

fixed bearing arm (6) located on the rotatable part (3) 
of the vehicle roof (1). 
Weapons carriage according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the upper base of the carriage (13) is formed via 

an angled lever (9) which is capable of being adjusted in 
different positions of alignment by means of a bar (15) 

which is adjustable via the aligning spindle (14). 
Weapons carriage according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a parallelogram of links is formed 

on each side of the carriage (13). 
Weapons carriage according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that in the operating position the hatch 
(4) is positioned almost vertically and is provided with 

a sighting window (18) made of bullet-proof glass.  
 
Weapons carriage according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that an operating handle (24) is mounted 

in the hatch (1) for the purpose of aligning the carriage 
(13) in elevation, whereby the elevation-aligning spindle 

(14) automatically engages said operating handle during 
the process of opening the hatch (4).
