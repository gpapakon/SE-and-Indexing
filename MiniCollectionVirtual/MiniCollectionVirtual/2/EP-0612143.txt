<ABSTRACT>
Such an amplifier device makes use of a module for control of its output power depending on the geographical area to be covered. The structure used consists of two channels (A1, B) at least one of which (A1) is an amplification channel, which are coupled by at least one input coupling circuit (Ci) and which are preceded by a module (Z1, Z2) for mismatching their input impedance. This mismatching does not affect the stage which precedes the amplifier device. Application to mobile radios.

comprising an input coupling circuit (C
I
), an output coupling
circuit (C
O
) and a gain control formed by an impedance
mismatch circuit, characterized in that said input and output

coupling circuits are connected by a first amplifier system
(A1) on the one hand and by a second amplifier system (B) on

the other hand, said impedance mismatch circuit (21, 22)
being connected to the input of said amplifier systems (A1,

B) so that the values of the input impedances of said
amplifier systems returned to the accesses of the input

coupling circuit are similar.

characterized in that the mismatch circuit is a variable

impedance circuit formed by at least one PIN-diode (PIN1,
PIN2, PIN3, PIN4).
An amplifier arrangement as claimed in one of the
Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that a coupling circuit (C
I
