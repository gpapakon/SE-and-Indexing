<ABSTRACT>
In this test connector, for the stable mechanical connection of the connector housing (1) to the terminal housing (7) of a series terminal on the connector housing (1), provision is made, in the lower region, of a leg in the form of an actuating lever (4), the leg being mounted rotatably (5) and being placed under the load of a spring (8) which holds it with its locating hook (6) in positive connection with a corresponding contour in the terminal housing (7). The test contact pin (2) is connected on the upper side to a flexible lead (16) which leads to a lead connection (17) located in a fixed position in the connector housing (1), to which lead connection the external lead (18) is also connected. Mechanical loadings on the test connector fitted on and/or on the external lead (18) can have no negative influence on the contact of the test contact pin (2).

<CLAIMS>
A test plug for terminal blocks, comprising a plug housing (1) with
a test contact pin (2) which is guided therein in such a way that it can be

advanced in sprung relationship and which is connected to a conductor,
wherein provided on the plug housing (1) is a leg (4) which can be inserted

into an access opening (11) in the terminal block housing (7) and which at
its lower end has a retaining hook (6) for engaging under a terminal block

housing contour, characterised in that the leg is an actuating lever (4)
which is mounted rotatably to the plug housing (1) and which is under a

spring force (8) in the hooking direction of rotation.
A test plug according to claim 1 characterised in that fixed to the
test contact pin (2) is a flexible conductor (16) which is taken in the plug

housing (1) to a stationarily disposed conductor connection (17) for the
connection of an external conductor (18).
A test plug according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the test contact pin (2) is guided in a passage (15) provided separately for

same in the terminal block housing (7).
A test plug according to one of the preceding claims characterised
in that a guide leg (14) is arranged on the plug housing (1) in parallel

relationship with the actuating lever (4).
A test plug according to claim 2 characterised in that provided in
the actuating lever (4) is an opening (10) for the flexible internal

conductor (16) to pass freely therethrough.
A test plug according to claim 2 characterised in that the
conductor connection (17) has a connecting terminal for the flexible 

internal conductor (16) and a further connecting terminal (19) for the
external conductor (18) to be connected and only the connecting terminal

(19) for the external conductor (18) is accessible from the exterior through
an a
ccess opening (20) in the plug housing (1).
A test plug according to claim 2 characterised in that a chamber
(21) is formed in the plug housing (1) for receiving the flexible conductor

(16) which moves with the test contact pin (2).
A test plug according to one of the preceding claims characterised
in that lateral retaining elements (22) are provided on the plug housing (1)

and the actuating lever (4) for forming a block with further identical test
plugs.
A test plug according to one of the preceding claims characterised
in that in the region of the lower end of the plug housing (1) the actuating

lever (4) is mounted to the plug housing rotatably about an axis of rotation
(5), the spring (8) engages the actuating lever (4) in transversely directed

relationship with respect to the longitudinal extent of the test plug above
the axis of rotation (5) and the actuating lever (4) is angled outwardly in

the region of the spring engagement and terminates in a handle (9) which is
outside the plug housing (1).
