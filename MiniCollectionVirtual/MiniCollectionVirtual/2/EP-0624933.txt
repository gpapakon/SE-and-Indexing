<ABSTRACT>
A coaxial connector (10) for a coaxial cable (100) 
having a corrugated outer conductor (108), including one 

which is helically corrugated. An adapter (40) of the 
connector can include a crimpable sleeve (44) within which 

is a bushing (70) initially having an axial slot (72) of 
selected dimension. The inner surface (74) of the bushing 

is fluted defining ridges and grooves (for cable of annular 
corrugation), or a continuous helical ridge (76) and 

associated groove (78) defining a thread of corresponding 
pitch, and general inner diameter permitting cable 

insertion. Upon full threading of the cable end into 
adapter (40), crimp sleeve (44) is crimped thus closing 

axial slot (72) and stopping the crimp process to achieve a 
minimum desired inner diameter. The adapter may be a 

discrete subassembly and securable to a forward connector 
portion in modular fashion by complementary threaded flanges 

(32,46). A connector (500) can also include one or more 
radial holes (514) extending to the cable-receiving region 

permitting solder (522) or conductive epoxy to be deposited 
following cable insertion, for mechanically and electrically 

connecting the rearward connector portion to the cable outer 
conductor (510) other than by crimping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to electrical
connectors and more particularly to connectors for coaxial
cable having a corrugated outer conductor. Such a connector
includes a rearward connector portion having a complementary
corrugated shape for mechanically securing and electrically
connecting thereto. A forward connector portion is coupled
thereto for mating with a complementary connector.Generally coaxial cable includes an inner conductor
surrounded by a layer of dielectric material and precisely
centered within an outer conductor, and having an outer
jacket of dielectric material. In certain coaxial cable,
the outer conductor defines a ground return path necessary
for microwave signal transmission, and is termed semirigid
coaxial cable. In certain semirigid coaxial cable, the
outer conductor is strengthened by corrugation, and in
certain such cable the corrugation is helical, as is
described in proposed draft Military Specification MIL-C-28830/AA.
U.S. Patent No. 5,154,636 discloses a connector
for such cable including a forward connector assembly with an
inner contact disposed within a dielectric insert in an
outer conductive housing, with the outer housing including
a rearwardly extending threaded flange in which a flaring
ring is disposed. A rear connector portion is assembled
separately to the cable end, and comprises a clamping member
having a threaded inner surface to match the helical
corrugations of the outer cable conductor. The flaring ring
has an inner diameter at least as small as the inside
diameter of the helically corrugated outer cable conductor,
and includes a bevelled end which engages the inner surface
of the open end of the outer cable conductor to flare the
engaged portion outwardly against a complementarily bevelled
surface along the forward end of the clamping member, as the
forward connector assembly is threaded onto the end of the 
clamping member. U.S. Patent No. 5,137,470 discloses a
similar connector.What is needed is a coaxial connector for coaxial cable
having a corrugated outer conductor which is easily
assembled thereto without deforming the outer conductor of
the cable and which assures an electrical connection of the
inner surface of the outer conductor with the outer
conductive housing of the connector. The coaxial connector
should be crimpable to a corrugated cable outer conductor
with only slight deformation of the cable outer conductor
radially inwardly toward the inner conductor and yet establishing
an assured mechanical and electrical connection.
