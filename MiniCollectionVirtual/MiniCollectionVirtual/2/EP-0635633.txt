<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent an inadmissibly high vacuum in the tank breather valve (16) in the event of a defectively locking aeration valve (18) on the activated charcoal container (12), the pressure in the fuel tank (10) is monitored during the regeneration process and the tank breather valve closed if a limit is exceeded.

Method for monitoring a tank venting system 
trapping fuel vapours and feeding them to an internal 

combustion engine, 

with a container (12) which adsorbs fuel vapours and 
which is connected via a venting line (11) to the fuel 

tank (12) and via a regeneration line (13) to a suction 
pipe (15) of the internal combustion engine and which 

has a ventilation line (17) connected to the atmosphere 
and is capable of being closed by means of a ventilation 

valve (18), 
with a tank venting valve (16) arranged in the regeneration 
line (13), 
with a pressure sensor (20) recording the system 
pressure of the tank venting system, 
the tank venting valve (16) and the ventilation valve 
(18) being activated in the opening direction for 

feeding the fuel vapours stored in the container (12), 
the system pressure being monitored by means of the 
pressure sensor (20) during the feed of the fuel 

vapours, and 
the ventilation valve (18) being classified as working 
defectively if a predetermined pressure threshold value 

is exceeded, 
 
characterized in that, subsequently, the tank venting 

valve (16) is closed in order to avoid a further pressure 
rise in the tank venting system. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that 


a time meter is started when the threshold value is 
exceeded, and  

 
the tank venting valve (16) is closed when a 
predeterminable final meter value is reached.
