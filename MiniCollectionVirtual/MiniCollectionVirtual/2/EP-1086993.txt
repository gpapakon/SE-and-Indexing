<ABSTRACT>
New copper (Cu) complex azo dyes (I) of 1-((2-N-substituted-aminoethylsulfonyl)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylazo)-2-napht hol-3,6-disulfonic acids are claimed. New copper (Cu) complex azo dyes (I) of 1-((2-N-substituted-aminoethylsulfonyl)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylazo)-2-napht hol-3,6-disulfonic acids are of the formula; Z = 10-20 carbon (C) terpene-amino or an N-mono- or N,N-di-(1-16C alkyl)-amino group, in which the alkyl group(s) may be substituted by phenyl (optionally substituted by carboxy, carbamoyl, sulfo or sulfamoyl), amino, 2-4C alkanoylamino, hydroxy (OH), sulfo, sulfato, carboxy, carbamoyl or sulfamoyl and/or may have 1, 2 or 3 oxygen (O) atoms or imino (-NH-) groups in the chain; Independent claims are also included for: (a) salts of (I) with specified amines; (b) inks containing (I); (c) preparation of (I).
