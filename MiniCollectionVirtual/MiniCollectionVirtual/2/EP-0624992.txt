<ABSTRACT>
An upgrade arrangement wherein the switching functions of an in-service 
switch (101) or cross-connect system are transferred or "re-homed" onto a 

new, larger capacity switch (120) via the existing input and output ports (104,105) of 
the original system (101). The re-homing can be performed without loss of service, 

even if the original system is operating at full-capacity. By exploiting the protection 
redundancy engineered into existing telecommunication switching systems, all of the 

signals being routed through the original switch are temporarily consolidated onto 
only one-half (105) of the switching fabric normally required to accommodate such 

connectivity. This signal consolidation allows half (104) of the original switch ports 
to be brought off-line (without a service disruption), and linked to the new, higher 

capacity switching fabric (120). The signals that had been consolidated within the 
original switching fabric are then re-routed onto the new switching fabric (via the 

linked ports), and the other half of the original switch ports are brought off-line and 
linked to the new switching fabric. The re-routed signals
 (still being switched in a 
consolidated format within the new switching fabric) are then redistributed (un-consolidated) 

among the linked ports and the new switching fabric so that a normal 
switching pattern is reestablished. Re-homing the signals onto a single new 

switching fabric allows all connections to be managed from a single control point. 
In addition, the re-homing to the new switching fabric is operationally transparent 

(timing and protocols within the switching system are unaffected, and full non-blocking 
access is maintained), and all existing cabling to and from the original input 

and output ports remains intact and functioning. In a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, the input and output ports (104,105) of the original switching fabric are 

linked to the new switching fabric via electro/optic interfaces, (124-127), which 
replace the standard input and output circuits of the original system.

<DESCRIPTION>
Telecommunication switching and transmission systems sold today have a 
fixed-capacity, and, to minimize initial costs, service providers normally purchase systems 
having a capacity commensurate with, or marginally in excess of, immediate service 
demands. Typically, service demands grow to exceed the capacity of the purchased 
system, and telecommunication service providers find it necessary to migrate to larger 
capacity systems. To minimize additional expense and avoid service disruptions, service 
providers naturally want to preserve as much of the existing switching and transmission 
system as possible when expanding to accommodate increased traffic. As a result it is 
desirable to upgrade current systems, without noticeably impacting existing service. 
Presently, upgrading a system is a cumbersome, time consuming, labor intensive, and 
overall expensive undertaking. A typical upgrade is performed on a telecommunication system by linking 
an additional telecommunication system to the existing system via a fixed number of hard 
wired connections called interframe ties. This type of linking does not result in an 
architecture that guarantees full non-blocking access. That is to say, not all traffic entering 
one system will be able to gain access to a free output port on the other system. The 
degree to which such inter-system access can be obtained is a function of the number of 
interframe ties between the systems; increasing the ties increases the degree of access. 
Unfortunately, since each tie monopolizes a port on each system, increasing the number 
of interframe ties also reduces the overall traffic handling capacity of each system. 
Therefore, if two systems, each capable of accommodating N lines, are combined using 
this upgrading technique the resultant system will not support 2N lines. Before performing 
such an upgrade, the traffic flowing through the system must be carefully analyzed, and 
the trade-off between non-blocking access and overall traffic handling capacity considered 
so that the appropriate number of interframe ties may be calculated. As reconfiguring the 
upgraded system to alter the number of interframe ties is not easily accomplished, the 
upgraded system cannot be dynamically adapted to respond to subsequent changes in 
traffic patterns. Furthermore, prescribed telecommunication standards and/or electrical 
transmission delay constraints require the additional system introduced in an interframe tie 
upgrade to be located within a relatively short distance of the
