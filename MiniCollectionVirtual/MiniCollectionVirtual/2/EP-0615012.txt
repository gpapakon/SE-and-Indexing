having as their base natural or synthetic fibres, the method 
arranging that the natural and/or synthetic fibres are 

combined with conductive fibres during a step of intimate 
mixture. 
Textile thread for anti-stress fabrics which is produced 
according to the above method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method to produce textile 
threads and also the textile threads thus produced and 
suitable to make anti-stress textile products, as set forth 
in the respective main claims. The invention concerns in particular a method to produce 
textile threads suitable to possess a required conductivity. The invention concerns also the production of textile 
threads suitable to make fabrics able to lessen the effect 
of electromagnetic waves coming from outside onto the human 
body and to eliminate zones of build-up of static 
electricity on the surface of the human body by creating a 
re-distribution of the static electricity and eliminating 
the same. The anti-stress fabric according to the invention has the 
purpose of providing beneficial effects of relaxation and 
reduction of nervous tension and stress for its users 
together with an overall improvement of physical comfort. The anti-stress fabric according to the invention is 
employed advantageously, but not only, to make articles of 
clothing, whether underwear or outer garments, clothing for 
medical use, household linen, blankets, hats, gloves, etc. One of the known properties of textile fibres consists of 
their high resistivity, typically about values of 10¹³ W cm⁻¹, 
this being an index of a low screening and conductive 
power as against electromagnetic waves and/or electrostatic 
charges. Conductive materials such as metals, for instance, have 
much lower values of resistivity and therefore a better 
capability to act as a screen against electromagnetic waves 
or as a means to concentrate and eliminate electrostatic  
 
charges. The metal most widely employed in the field of conveying 
an electric current by a cable is copper, which has a 
resistivity of 10⁻⁶ W cm⁻¹. With regard to research on the damaging effects of 
electromagnetic waves and electrostatic charges built up 
within the human organism the problem, in the textile field, 
of making products, such as yarns, fabrics or garments, 
which are characterised by good conductivity and good 
screening has been tackled. The word "fabric" in this invention is to be understood as 
meaning a fabric made with warp and weft, or a non-woven 
fabric, or a knitted fabric. The methods employed in this field so far have been 
substantially as follows. The first method provides for direct impregnation of the 
fabric with antistatic chemical additives. The second method consists in the direct application of a 
thin film of metallic material to the fabric. The third method consists of
