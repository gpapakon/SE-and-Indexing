<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a pair of bead cores (5) 
one disposed in each bead portion (4), a toroidal 

carcass (6) extending between the bead portions (4) 
and turned up around said pair of bead cores (5), 

and a belt (7) disposed radially outside the carcass 
(6) and inside a tread portion (2), characterised in 

that the belt comprises a ply (7A,7B) of parallel 
hybrid cords (11), each hybrid cord (11) comprising 

at least one aramid strand (13)and at least one 
steel strand (14) twisted together, said at least 

one aramid strand (13) being made of aramid fibre 
filaments twisted together, and said at least one 

steel strand (14) being made of a steel 
monofilament.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre, 
the weight of which is reduced whilst the steering 
stability and low noise nature are maintained. In order to reinforce the tread portion of a tyre, 
it has been proposed to use a belt made of aramid 
cords. However, if only an aramid cord belt is 
disposed in the tread portion, the tyre can not be 
provided with sufficient rigidity because the aramid 
cords are weak in compressive stress in contrast 
with their very high tensile modulus and lightweight 
nature. As a result, an aramid belt tyre is 
inferior in steering stability to a steel belt tyre. Further, due to the decreased tread rigidity, 
deformation and vibration of the tyre are liable to 
occur during running, which result in increased tyre 
noise. As a countermeasure for such decreased tread 
rigidity, it has been proposed to provide a steel 
cord belt together with an aramid cord belt. In 
such a case, however, the belt thickness is  
 
inevitably increased, and the tyre weight is 
increased. "RESEARCH DISCLOSURE" No. 159, July 1977, pages 53-54, shows a way 
of reducing the tyre weight by means of a reinforcing layer made of 
hybrid cords of aramid and steel. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre, in which the tyre 
weight is reduced, with the tread rigidity being 
maintained. According to the present invention, a pneumatic tyre 
comprises a pair of bead cores one disposed in each 
bead portion, a toroidal carcass extending between 
the bead portions and turned up around said pair of 
bead cores, and a belt disposed radially outside the 
carcass and inside a tread portion, the belt 
comprising two cross plies, each made of parallel 
hybrid cords of aramid and steel, each said hybrid 
cord comprising a core and an outer layer, each core 
consisting of first strands twisted together in a 
first direction, said outer layer consisting of 
second strands twisted around said core in a second 
direction which is reverse to the first direction, 
said first strands made of one of the two materials 
of aramid and steel, and said second strands made of 
the other material, the steel strand consisting of a 
steel monofilament, and the aramid strand consisting 
of aramid yarns twisted together in a third  
 
direction, each said aramid yarn consisting of 
aramid fibre filaments twisted together in a fourth 
direction which is reverse to the third direction. Preferably, the total denier of all the aramid 
fibres in each hybrid cord is in the range of from 
800
