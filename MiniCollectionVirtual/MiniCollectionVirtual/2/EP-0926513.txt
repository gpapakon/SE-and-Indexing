<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical imaging system used in an image
transmission portion of, for example, a facsimile device or a copier. More
particularly, the invention relates to an optical imaging system comprising a
plurality of rod lenses arranged in an array.Optical imaging systems comprising a plurality of rod lenses with a
refractive index distribution in a radial direction that are arranged in an
array are widely used in the image transmission portion of, for example,
facsimile devices or copiers.The refractive index distribution of such rod lenses can be expressed,
for example by
 n(r)2 = n0 2 · {1 - (g · r)2 + h4 · (g · r)4 + h6 · (g · r)6}
wherein r is the radial distance from the optical axis of the rod lens, n(r) is
the refractive index at the radial distance r from the optical axis of the rod
lenses, n0 is the refractive index at the optical axis of the rod lens (center
refractive index), and g, h4 and h6 are coefficients for the refractive index
distribution.Conventionally, the resolving power demanded from such a rod lens
array called for an MTF (modulation transfer function) of at least 60% when
a pattern of 4 - 6 line-pairs/mm (ca. 200dpi - 300dpi) was imaged. To meet
this demand, it was sufficient to control only g or both g and h4 of the
refractive index distribution coefficients for the rod lens.Recently, however, with the steadily rising quality of printers and
scanners, there is a demand for rod lens arrays with a resolving power of at
least 12 line-pairs/mm (ca. 600dpi). To realize a rod lens array having such
a high resolving power, all refractive index distribution coefficients including
h6 have to be controlled precisely during design and fabrication of the rod
lens array.It is possible to determine the optimum refractive index distribution
coefficients for correcting the spherical aberration on the optical axis of a
single rod lens. However, in the case of a plurality of rod lenses arranged in
an array, not only spherical aberration, image curvature and astigmatism of
the individual lenses, but also the overlapping of images from neighboring
lenses may change the resolving power. The optimum refractive index distribution changes also with the
brightness of the rod lenses. For example, in the case of bright rod lenses
with a large aperture angle, the refractive index distribution coefficients for
a small axial spherical aberration are very different from the refractive index
distribution coefficients for a small image curvature. The best resolving
power can be attained by
