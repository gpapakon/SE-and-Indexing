<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a collection device for collecting 
material such as grass cuttings and debris entrained in a stream 

of air. In particular, the collection device comprises an outer 
housing (1), a receiving receptacle locatable within the outer 

housing for receiving the so-entrained material, the receptacle 
including at least one air permeable region permitting air to 

exit from the receiving receptacle and means for leading exhaust 
air from the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collection device for collecting grass cuttings from a lawn mowing machine of a type which positions the collection device in the path of an operator as the lawn moving machine is moved forwards and which entrains the grass cuttings in a stream of air.EP A 0501674 discloses a lawnmower having a collecting facility whereby grass cuttings are collected firm the ground by a stream of air which is sucked into the machine by an impeller which blows air into a cutting chamber. The grass cuttings are removed from the stream of air by an air-permeable container.Although certain rotary mowers particularly for domestic use do not have a facility for collecting grass cuttings and other debris from a lawn, many rotary and cylindrical type domestic lawnmowers do include such a facility. Grass cut by a rotary lawnmower is directed into a grass-box when entrained in a stream of air created by rotation of the rotary cutter. Cornentionally the cut grass is collected in a grass-box, and air is exhausted from the grass-box through a number of air vents or louvres. Although, the grass cuttings and other debris are retained within the grass-box, nevertheless it is not unusual for a considerable amount of dust and other small particles of waste to be exhausted in the stream of air leaving the grass-box. By virtue of the positioning of the vents or louvres, this exhaust stream is directed into the path of the machine operator. Furthermore, conventional construction of grass-boxes does not serve to reduce the noise emitted from a lawnmowerIt is an aim of the present invention not only to improve the collection facility of grass cutting from a lawn mowing machine, but also to reduce the noise level emitted by a machine.The present invention provides a collection device for collecting according to claim 1.One form of the device includes one or more projections extending between the receptacle and the outer housing so that the projections and the confronting regions together constitute duct means for leading exhaust air from the device through at least one air-permeable region serving to establish access between the interior of the receiving receptacle and the duct means. The region of the receptacle which confronts the outer housing to at least partially define the cavity means preferably includes the air-permeable region.According to one embodiment of the invention, the receiving receptacle comprises a first wall including an inlet for material entering the receptacle, a base and two further walls,

<CLAIMS>
A collection device for collecting grass cuttings from a lawn mowing machine of a type which positions the collection device in the path of an operator as the lawn mowing machine is moved forwards and which entrains said grass cuttings in a stream of air, the device comprising an outer housing (1) having an open base, a receiving receptacle locatable within the outer housing (1) for receiving the so-entrained grass cuttings, the receptacle including at least one air-permeable region permitting air to exit from the receiving receptacle, and cavity means for leading exhaust air 
downwardly
 from the device directly to the ground through the open base of the outer housing (1), wherein the partially defined by confronting regions of the receptacle and the outer housing, 
the outer housing extending to the bottom of the receptacle.
A device according to claim 1, further comprising one or more projections (P) extending between the receptacle and the outer housing (1), the projections (P) and the confronting regions together constituting duct means for leading exhaust air from the device.
A device according to claim 2, wherein the said at least one air-permeable region establishes access between the interior of the receiving receptacle and the duct means.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the region of the receptacle which confronts the outer housing (1) to at least partially define the cavity means includes the air-permeable region.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the outer housing extends downwards, in use, substantially to the ground.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the receiving receptacle comprises a first wall (A) including an inlet (3) for grass cuttings entering
 the receptacle, a base (B), and two further walls (C), each further wall (C) being joined to the base (B) and the first wall (A).
A device according to claim 6, wherein at least one of the two further walls (C) includes the air-permeable region.
A device according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the receiving receptacle is of generally rectangular form having an open area opposite from the first wall (A), wherein the receptacle is pivotally mounted within the outer housing (1) at a position in the region of the first wall (A), and the open base of the outer housing (1) permits pivotal movement of the receptacle to allow removal of grass cuttings therefrom through the said open area and the open base of the housing.
A device according to claim 8, wherein the outer housing (1) is of generally rectangular form, and includes two side walls disposed respectively in confronting and spaced apart relationship with the said two further walls (C) of the receptacle to constitute the cavity means.
A device according to claim 9, wherein the outer housing (1) includes means for attaching a collector (11) thereto so that, during pivotal movement of the receptacle, grass cuttings from the receptacle are fed into the collector (11).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the receiving receptacle includes an inlet (3) for grass cuttings entering the receptacle from the machine, and said cavity means is disposed on the side of the inlet (3) remote from the machine.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims adapted and arranged for collecting grass cuttings from a lawnmower machine of the type having a cutter blade rotatable about a generally vertical axis.
A grass cutting machine including a device according to any one of claims 1 to 11 for receiving cut grass entrained in a stream of air, the machine arranged such that, as it moves forward, the collection device is in the path of an operator.
A machine according to claim 13, further comprising means for detachably removing the device from the machine.
