<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrogen
storage alloy electrode and to a sealed-type nickel-metal
hydride storage battery using the same electrode.A nickel-cadmium storage battery is well known
as one of sealed-type alkaline storage batteries which has
recently been utilized in a variety of applications.
Recently, as a battery system having a higher energy
density than batteries currently available, the nickel-metal
hydride storage batteries are being developed by
utilizing a negative electrode comprising a metal hydride,
i.e., a hydrogen storage alloy, capable of absorbing or
desorbing hydrogen in a reversible manner at a low
pressure. In order to realize such a hydrogen storage
alloy electrode as the negative electrode of the nickel-metal
hydride storage battery, the following processes
have been proposed so far.
(1) A process of producing the electrode by
sintering a powder of the hydrogen storage alloy together 
with a powder of an electrically conductive agent.(2) A process of producing the electrode by
filling or loading a powder of the hydrogen storage alloy
in a three-dimensional porous metal substrate such as
foamed nickel.(3) A process of producing the electrode by
causing a two-dimensional conductive support such as a
punched or perforated sheet of conductor or metal to hold
a mixture comprising a powder of the hydrogen storage
alloy and a high polymer binder such as
polytetrafluoroethylene.Incidentally, a sealed-type alkaline storage
battery configured with a hydrogen storage alloy electrode
is usually designed so that the capacity of the negative
electrode is larger than the capacity of the positive
electrode as in the design of the nickel-cadmium storage
battery. This design enables the battery to lower the
inner pressure of the battery vessel, by consuming oxygen
gas generated from the positive electrode during the
overcharging process at the negative electrode. In
addition to the generation of the oxygen gas from the
positive electrode as in the case of the nickel-cadmium
storage battery, the alkaline storage battery configured
with the hydrogen storage alloy electrode further suffers
an excessive rise in the inner pressure caused by an
accumulation of hydrogen gas generated from the negative 
electrode.In order to cope with this difficulty, there has
been proposed a method of providing a water-repellent
layer on the surface of the electrode and another method
of providing a part demonstrating a hydrophilic property
inside the electrode.The negative electrode, having a
