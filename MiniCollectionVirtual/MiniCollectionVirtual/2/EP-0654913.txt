<ABSTRACT>
A double dwell, maximum likelihood, serial sliding acquisition system (10) employs
two thresholds which are a function of maximum likelihood thresholds, and not

predetermined optimal thresholds. The two thresholds have values that are signal
dependent, and are obtained in real time from a correlation of a received PN signal

and a locally generated PN sequence during the acquisition process. The acquisition
system continuously monitors the reliability of the detected signal. As a result, the

decision making process is continuously performed so as to terminate the
acquisition process whenever the detected signal is determined to be reliable. The

acquisition system employs a principle that an optimal threshold level, in the power
domain, is 6 dB lower than that of the maximum likelihood signal. The acquisition

system obtains the maximum signal power from a maximum likelihood detector
portion to adaptively update a threshold estimate, and then uses the adaptive

threshold estimate for monitoring the reliability of the detected signal. After the
reliable signal is detected the search process continues for an additional interval of

time which is a function of a false alarm probability. The limited interval for which
the search process continues is preferably a fraction or multiple of the second,

longer dwell time. This additional searching interval is referred to as a post-detection
search interval. During the post-detection search interval, the acquisition

system monitors the received signal samples and, when no additional signal is
detected, the acquisition process is terminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to wireless communication systems and, in 
particular, to radiotelephones that operate in accordance with spread spectrum 
techniques. A direct-sequence or direct sequence coding spread spectrum communication 
technique in essence combines two digital signals, or bit streams, to create a third 
signal prior to transmission. The first signal is an information signal, such as the 
output of a digitized voice circuit. For example, the first signal may have a bit rate 
of 10 kb/s. The second signal is generated by a random-sequence, or pseudonoise 
(PN) generator, and is a stream of essentially random bits having a bit rate that is 
several orders of magnitude greater than the bit rate of the digitized voice signal. 
The modulation of these two signals results in the third signal having the same bit 
rate as the second signal. However, the third signal also contains the digitized voice 
signal. At the receiver, an identical random-sequence generator produces a random 
bit stream which mirrors the original random-sequence that was used for 
modulation at the transmitter. For proper operation, after carrier frequency demodulation, 
the PN generator of the receiver must be synchronized to the incoming 
PN sequence. By removing the random sequence from the received signal and 
integrating it over a symbol period, a despread signal is obtained. Ideally, the 
despread signal exactly represents the original 10 kb/s voice signal. A primary function of synchronization in such a spread spectrum communication 
system is to despread the received pseudonoise (PN) code for demodulation of the 
received signal. This is accomplished by generating a local replica of the PN code 
in the receiver, and then synchronizing the local PN signal to the PN signal which 
is superimposed on the incoming received signal. The process of synchronization 
is conventionally accomplished in two steps. The first step, referred to as 
acquisition, brings the two spreading signals into alignment with one another. The 
second step, referred to as tracking, subsequently and continuously maintains the  
 
best possible waveform alignment by means of a feedback loop. Of primary interest 
herein is the acquisition step of the synchronization process. Because of the importance of synchronization (or acquisition), many techniques 
have been proposed which utilize various types of detectors and decision 
strategies. One common feature of all conventional synchronization techniques 
that are known to the inventors is
