<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of an ester or a mixture of 

esters, comprising allowing an olefin, carbon monoxide and an 
alcohol to react in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. The 

esters can be produced at high yields at a low temperature over 
a short period of time. The esters can be easily separated 

from the reaction solution and hydrogen fluoride can be 
recycled. The kinetic viscosity and the colouration of the 

mixture of the esters can be easily adjusted and an increase in 
the viscosity of the esters can be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of esters for use in a variety of products such 
as perfumes, jet engine oils, grease for use at a low 
temperature, heat-resistant engine oils, refrigerating 
machine oils, rubbers, inks and coating compositions. More 
specifically, it relates to a process for the production of 
a mixture of esters from an olefin, carbon monoxide and an 
alcohol, which mixture is advantageously used as an engine 
oil and a refrigerating machine oil. Conventionally, an ester is produced by the 
reaction of dehydration in which a fatty acid and an alcohol 
are heated in the presence of a catalyst, as is described, 
e.g., US-A-5,202,044. The catalyst used for the 
above dehydration is selected from acid catalysts such as 
sulfuric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid and organic titanate 
compounds such as tetrapropyl titanate. The reaction of the above dehydration is an 
equilibrium reaction, and an excess of an alcohol is used. 
The reaction is promoted by removing formed water from the 
reaction system. Generally, however, the reaction rate is 
low, and it requires a long period of time to complete the 
reaction. Further, for producing an ester, for example, 
from a branched fatty acid such as neo-acid type, it is 
required to proceed with the reaction at a high temperature 
of at least 200°C for at least 10 hours. As a result, it is 
required to use a large-volume reactor of a high-quality  
 
material, and it requires an additional cost. For avoiding the reaction which is carried out at 
a high temperature for a long period of time, JP-A-4-314793 
and JP-A-5-1291 propose a method in which an ester is 
produced through an acid chloride. In the above method of the esterification through 
an acid chloride, however, it is first required to produce 
the acid chloride from a carboxylic acid, and for this 
purpose, acid chlorides of inorganic acids such as 
phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride or thionyl 
chloride are used. These acid chlorides of inorganic acids 
are difficult to handle, and require complicated steps. As described above, in the conventional processes 
for the production of esters, the reaction rate is low and 
it is required to use a large-volume reactor formed of a 
high-quality material when they are produced by the 
dehydration reaction between fatty acids and alcohols. 
Further, in the method in which an ester is formed through 
an acid chloride, a complicated step is required, since 
acid chloride of inorganic acid is used.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of an ester or a mixture 
of esters by allowing an olefin, carbon monoxide and an alcohol 

to react in the presence of hydrogen fluoride, which process 
comprises: 


(a) reacting an olefin and carbon monoxide in the 
presence of hydrogen fluoride to synthesize an acyl 

fluoride; 
(b) reacting the acyl fluoride in the resultant hydrogen 
fluoride-containing reaction solution with an alcohol 

to form an ester or esters; and 
(c) distilling the thus-obtained esterification solution 
under reflux with a saturated hydrocarbon having a 

higher boiling point than the acyl fluoride and which 
is inert to the acyl fluoride, to separate and 

recover the hydrogen fluoride. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the hydrogen 
fluoride is used in an amount of at least 5 mol per mole of the 

olefin, and the hydrogen fluoride separated and recovered in 
step (c) is recycled to step (a). 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
olefin has at least 4 carbon atoms, and the reaction 

temperature and/or the reaction pressure in step (a) are/is 
adjusted to form esters having a desired kinetic viscosity. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, comprising an 
additional step, before step (b), of distilling the hydrogen 

fluoride-containing reaction solution from step (a) under 
reflux with a saturated hydrocarbon which has a higher boiling 

point than the acyl fluoride and which is inert to the acyl  
 

fluoride. 
A process according to claim 4, wherein the saturated 
hydrocarbon in the said additional step is used in an amount of 

0.5 to 2.0 mol per mole of the olefin. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the saturated hydrocarbon is at least one member 

selected from hexane, heptane, octane, nonane and decane. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, further comprising: 


washing the ester-containing solution from step (c) 
with water;

A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the alcohol is a monohydric alcohol or an 

alcohol having at least difunctionality. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein an equivalent ratio of OH group of the alcohol 

to the olefin is 2 or less.
