<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid coaxial cable network employing interdiction to ensure privacy in telephony communications. The video and telephony signals are secured such that telephony and interactive video signals to and from a subscriber do not appear on the network at any other undesired subscriber location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of telecommunications. More particularly
the invention relates to the field of multiplex communications. In still greater
particularity, the invention relates to the provision of secured telephony in a coaxial
cable network. By way of further characterization, but not by way of limitation
thereto, the invention uses interdiction to prevent monitoring of a subscriber's
telephone communications by another subscriber on the network.Information, and access to it, has received significant attention recently. The
building of an "information highway" compared to the national interstate highway
system begun in the 1950s has been made a national priority. There are currently
three wireline transport elements available for such a highway: (1) fiber optic cable;
(2) coaxial cable; and (3) twisted copper pair cable ("twisted pair"). Presently,
twisted pair cable predominates, certainly in the local loop portion of telephone
networks. Coaxial cable has been used widely by cable television companies. Both
telephone companies and cable companies have made use of fiber optics for main or
trunk line signal transport. As disclosed for example in WO 92/10038 coaxial cables are
further employed
in CATV systems including a headend transmitting programming
to a plurality of subscribers.Fiber optic cable can carry more information over a greater distance than
coaxial cable, while coaxial cable can carry more information over a greater distance
than twisted pairs. Because twisted pair is the predominant local loop technology, at
least in the telephone industry, attempts have been made to develop technologies 
which will increase the carrying capacity of copper. In reality, copper wire is a very
efficient transport means for traditional telephony services.Within the telephony industry, the term "broadband" denotes a very high
digital line rate, such as the 156 Megabits per second (Mb/s) optical line rate of new
SONET OC3-level fiber optic systems. The term "baseband" describes the original
(unmodulated) form of the electrical or optical signal associated with a single service
that is typically presented to the network by a subscriber, and the final form of that
signal presented from the network to a subscriber. The baseband signal can be either
analog or digital in form, and is further characterized as the direct electromagnetic
representation of the base information to be transmitted, with no other carrier or
subcarrier energy present. A baseband signal may be carried directly on a
transmissio

A system for providing telephony services to a
subscriber location (21) comprising:


a logical bus network including a coaxial cable network
(24) having at least a first signal path and a second signal path

to and from said subscriber location (21) for transporting

telephony signals in a downstream frequency range and an upstream
frequency range;

operatively associated with said coaxial cable network (24), for 

supplying power to a subscriber telephone (27) through said
coaxial cable network (24).
A method for supplying telephony services to a
subscriber location (21), comprising:


transporting telephony signals in an upstream frequency range
and a downstream frequency range over a logical bus network

including a coaxial cable network (24); and
interdicting said telephony signals on said coaxial cable

range on said first signal path from said subscriber location

(21); and

   isolating telephony signals in said upstream frequency range
from said subscriber location (21) on said second signal path from

one subscriber on the network to another;

   wherein modulated telephony signals to and from said
subscriber location (21) cannot be monitored at another subscriber

location on said logical bus network.

coaxial cable network (24) with a demodulated telephony signal;

and 
separating said demodulated telephony signals from said video
