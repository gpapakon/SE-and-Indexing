<ABSTRACT>
A micro-strip type connector (40) 
has a one-piece receptacle ground bus (48). The 

connector includes two parallel rows (46) of signal 
contacts (44), one row on each side of the ground bus 

(48), the signal contacts (44) and the bus bar (48) 
having solder tails (54) that extend through plated 

through holes (58,64,62) in a substrate (59), and are 
soldered in place there. The one-piece receptacle 

ground bus (48) includes a flat vertically disposed root 
section (74), a plurality of first contact beams (76) in 

a row and extending from the top edge of the root 
section (74) and a plurality of members extending 

from the bottom edge which are bent around through 180 
degrees to be parallel with the root section (74) and 

extending upwardly to form another row of second contact 
beams (86), the two rows of beams (76,86) converging. A 

plurality of solder tails (54 ) extend from the bottom 
edge of the root section (74).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printed circuit 
board electrical connectors of the type having a ground 
bus adjacent a row of signal terminals or between two 
parallel rows of such terminals. Known controlled characteristic impedance 
electrical connectors for interconnecting printed 
circuit boards employ a ground bus which parallels one 
or more rows of signal contacts. Where relatively high 
speed, error free data transmission is required, special 
care must be taken when designing the components of 
these connectors to assure proper spacing and to 
minimize the effects of discontinuities. Such a known 
connector is disclosed in US-A-4,762,500, which 
discloses a blade-like male ground bus and a mating 
female receptacle ground bus where 
the receptacle ground bus is constructed from two mating 
halves. The two mating halves include flat opposing 
contact sections for mating electrical contact with the 
blade type male ground bus, and solder tails which 
extend into plated through holes in a printed circuit 
board and are soldered in place. The electrical connector of the above construction 
has the advantage of properly spacing the signal 
contacts and reducing discontinuities. However, on the other hand, the connector having 
the above construction has the following disadvantages. 
The two separate pieces of the receptacle ground bus are 
not easily assembled into the connector housing. The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned 
problems by providing a receptacle ground 
bus of unitary construction that will maintain the 
controlled characteristic impedance of the connector 
while enabling easy installation. Further, an 
important advantage of the one-piece ground bus of the 
present invention over the known art two-piece ground  
 
bus is that the one-piece ground bus is more easily 
assembled and is automatically maintained in proper 
position within the slots in the connector housing prior 
to assembling and soldering to the printed circuit 
board. Additionally, the characteristic impedance of 
the connector is maintained while utilizing a less 
expensive one-piece ground bus structure. The present invention consists in an electrical connector as defined in claim 1. An electrical connector according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-4 710 133. An embodiment of the present invention will now be 
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings in which:

A controlled impedance electrical connector 
(40) in which a plurality of signal contacts (44) 

arranged in at least one row (46) are positioned 
adjacent a ground bus (48), the signal contacts (44) of 

said one row (46) being separated from the ground bus 
(48) by a dielectric wall, and said ground bus (48) 

extending along a portion of the length of said one row 
(46) 


and including a root section (74) of approximately rectangular cross section, a plurality of spaced apart first beams (76) extending from one side of said root section (74) and each terminating in a first contact (79) and a plurality of leads (54) extending from the opposite side of the root section (74) for making electrical contact with circuits on a substrate (59), characterized in that: 
a plurality of spaced apart members extend from the opposite side of said root section (74) wherein each member is bent through substantially 180 degrees to extend substantially parallel to said root section (74), thereby forming a shank (84), and then extends further to form a second beam (86) and terminates in a second contact (88).

said bus root section (74) is substantially flat and 

each shank (84) of said plurality of members is 
substantially parallel to said bus root section (74).

said first and second beams (76,86) mutually converge 

toward their respective first and second contacts 
(79,88). 
The connector according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 
length of said first beam (76) is greater than the 

length of said second beam (86). 
The connector according to any one of claims 
1-4, wherein adjacent first beams (76) include a space  

 
therebetween and each said space is opposed by a second 

beam (86) so that said first and second beams (76,86) 
are mutually staggered.
