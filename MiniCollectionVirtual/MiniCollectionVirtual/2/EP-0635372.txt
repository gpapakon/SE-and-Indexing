<ABSTRACT>
A preliminary ejection sensor (29) of an ink jet 
recording apparatus includes a vibration plate (296) 

adapted to vibrate on receipt of an ink droplet 
ejected from an ejection port (323c) on a recording 

head (32) in order to detect the vibration of the 
vibration plate (296) depending on variation of a 

gap between a core (292a) and the vibration plate, 
whereby it can be checked whether ink is ejected 

from the recording head or not. In addition, the 
preliminary ejection sensor can check the present 

ink ejecting state of the recording head. Thus, in 
contrast with a conventional sensing system wherein 

ink ejection is sensed by an optical sensor on one 
side surface of the recording head, the structure of 

the ink jet recording apparatus can be simplified. 
Additionally, in contrast with another conventional 

checking system wherein a temperature sensor is 
disposed on the recording head to indirectly check 

the present ink ejecting state of the recording head 
by monitoring the elevated temperature, the ink jet 

recording apparatus assures that a checking 
operation can quickly be achieved at a high 

accuracy. Consequently, the ink jet recording 
apparatus makes it possible to exactly detect 

whether or not ink is correctly ejected from ink 
ejection ports (323c) formed on the jet recording 

head (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording apparatus as well as an ink jet recording
head employable for the ink jet recording apparatus.
Further, the present invention relates to a method
for determining the ejection state of an ink jet
recording head for an ink jet recording apparatus of
the foregoing type.Many proposals have been hitherto made with
respect to a recording apparatus for performing a
recording operation for a recording medium such as
paper, a sheet of material for OHP or a similar
material (hereinafter referred to as a recording
paper sheet or a paper sheet) in such a manner that
a recording head operable in accordance with a
various kind of recording system is mounted on the
recording apparatus. The recording head for the
recording apparatus is typically exemplified by a
wire dot type recording head, a heat susceptible
type recording head, a thermal image transferring
type recording head and an ink jet type recording
head.Among the aforementioned conventional recording
heads, sincere attention has been paid to the ink 
jet type recording head adapted to eject ink
directly to a recording paper sheet because it is
operated at a low running cost without any
generation of noisy sound.Since the ink jet type recording head having a
plurality of fine ink ejection ports arranged
thereon is generally employed for an ink jet
recording apparatus of the foregoing type, in the
case that gas bubbles or dust particles are involved
in each ink ejection port or in the case that ink
fails to be ejected from each ink ejection port of
the recording head due to its increased viscosity
caused by evaporation of an ink solvent or the ink
is transformed to assume another state unsuitable
for performing a recording operation therewith, a
measure is taken such that factors associated with
improper ink ejection are obviated by refreshing the
ink (the foregoing measure is called an ejection
recovering treatment).This ejection recovering treatment is
practically executed in accordance with the
following manner. Specifically, ejection recovering
treatment is executed such that an element for
generating energy to be utilized for ejecting ink
from each ejection port of the recording head is
activated while a suitable ink receiving member is
disposed opposite to the ejection port forming
surface of the recording head so that ink is
properly ejected from each ejection port of the
recording head (this type of ejection recovering
treatment is called preliminary ejection treatment).
Otherwise, ejection
