<ABSTRACT>
An automatic cushioning control apparatus for a cylinder of a working machine, capable of providing a quiet cylinder 
cushioning effect causing little shaking of a vehicle body without using a mechanical cylinder cushion. To obtain such an effect, 

this apparatus is provided with a means (1) for detecting the position of a working machine cylinder in the direction of a stroke 
thereof, a means (2) for detecting the direction of extending and retracting movement of the cylinder of the working machine, a 

means (3) for computing lever gain (K) with respect to a level signal from a lever (4) which is adapted to satisfy the relation, o 
<
 
K 
<
 1, in accordance with signals from the means (1, 2), and change from one toward zero in accordance with the distance between 
the free end of the cylinder and a stroke end thereof when the cylinder is moved toward its stroke end, a multiplication element 

(5) adapted to multiply an operating instruction from the lever (4) by the lever gain K, and a means (6) for controlling the 
driving of the cylinder of the working machine in accordance with an output from the multiplication element (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
cushioning control apparatus for a cylinder of a 
working machine such as a hydraulic shovel, wheel 
loader, and the like, which is driven by a hydraulic 
cylinder, in the working machine of construction 
equipment. Conventionally, construction equipment, which has 
a working machine such as a hydraulic shovel driven by 
a hydraulic cylinder, is provided with a mechanical 
cushion to ease a shock at a stroke end of a cylinder, 
the shock being caused when an operator operates a 
lever. If the lever is fully moved, hitting the stroke 
end, a conventional mechanical cushion cannot 
completely absorb the speed because of the inertia 
force of the working machine and a big noise is 
produced at the time of the collision, causing a 
vehicle body to shake. In addition, a cushion chamber 
is subjected to a high back pressure, adversely 
affecting the durability of the cylinder and also  
 
leading to higher structural cost. To solve these 
problems; 
(1) there is a method available, wherein a cylinder 
length is detected so that, when a dangerous zone set 
near the stroke end thereof is reached, the engine RPM 
or the angle of a swash plate is decreased to reduce 
the discharge quantity of a pump, thereby decreasing 
the retracting speed of the cylinder, and (2) there is another method available, wherein a 
cylinder control valve is set back to the neutral to 
stop the cylinder (refer to the publication of 
unexamined JP patent application No. 2-57703). They have, however, disadvantages described below: 
(1) The method, wherein the engine RPM or the 
discharging quantity of the pump is reduced, prevents 
satisfactory composite operation because an engine pump 
is not provided on each shaft of the working machine, 
and therefore, each time one shaft reaches a stroke 
end, the working speed of other shafts unavoidably 
decreases. There is another disadvantage in that the 
engine or the pump is required to exhibit extremely 
high responsiveness. (2) The method, wherein the cylinder control valve is 
set back to the neutral, is disadvantageous in that, 
when the cylinder length reaches the dangerous zone, a 
controller issues a signal for setting the valve back 
to the neutral independently of the lever operation  
 
performed by an operator, thus carrying out automatic 
deceleration irrespectively of operator's intent. In general, when operating a shaft with high 
inertia at a full lever stroke, the dangerous zone must 
be secured with a certain level of ampleness in
