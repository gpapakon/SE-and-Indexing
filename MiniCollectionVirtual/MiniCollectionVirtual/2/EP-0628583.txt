suitable for use in the interior linings of cars, with 

a reduced fogging effect, whose content by weight of the 
cyclic adipate of diethylene glycol, 8,13-dioxo-1,4,7-trioxacyclotridecane, 

is less than 0.25% and preferably 
less than 0.17%.

preparing said polyurethane foams, whose content by 

weight of the cyclic adipate of diethylene glycol, 8,13-dioxo-1,4,7-trioxacyclotridecane,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flexible 
polyurethane foams, suitable for use in the car industry, 
which give a considerably reduced fogging effect 
because they are manufactured using polyester polyols in 
which the proportion of volatile residues has been 
reduced or in which said residues have been eliminated. In the industry of manufacturing polymeric 
materials for the car industry there is a growing 
preoccupation regarding the fogging of the front and 
rear windscreens and side windows of cars because of the 
volatile residues condensation that accompanies said 
polymeric materials. This problem, which is known in the 
industrial sector as the fogging effect, as well as the 
unpleasant characteristic odour produced by the evaporation 
of said volatile residues and its possible toxic 
consequences, is produced in conditions in which the 
interior of the vehicle is subjected to relatively high 
temperatures, such as for example when closed vehicles 
are exposed to the sun, causing the volatile substances 
to evaporate and condense on the colder surfaces of the 
windows. As a result, the car industry imposes increasingly 
stricter requirements on the suppliers of polymeric 
materials, such that now it is required that the polymeric 
materials used in the interiors of cars give a 
fogging effect less than 1 mg in the gravimetric test 
according to Standard DIN 75201 B. Recent publications have disclosed the influence of 
some additives on the fogging effect produced by flexible 
polyurethane foams made of polyether polyols. 
Blundell, C. and Wuestenenk, J., Utech'90 Proceedings,  
 
76-79 (1990) have shown the influence of flame retarding 
agents, and Diblitz, K. and Hoell, D., Utech'90 Proceedings, 
80-85 (1990) have done the same with amine-type 
catalysts. If they are well formulated, flexible polyurethane 
foams made using polyether polyols exhibit fogging 
values that are lower than those made using polyester 
polyols. However, foams made using polyester polyols 
provide advantages such as better mechanical properties, 
a better cellular structure, greater resistance to oils 
and oxidation, and furthermore are easier to flame roll, 
have a lower total emission of gases and are easier to 
recycle. Therefore, the need remains to solve the 
problem of providing the car industry with flexible 
polyurethane foams made using polyester polyols that, 
without losing their excellent properties, have reduced 
levels of fogging that fulfil the strict requirements 
imposed by said industry. The present
