<ABSTRACT>
[Object] To provide a genetic engineering process for 

producing α-amylase with the use of an isolated hyperthermostable 
α-amylase gene.

 
[Constitution]
 A hyperthermostable α-amylase gene 
comprising a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID 

NO: 1 of the sequence listing (obtained from 
Pyrococcus
furiosus
 
and having a sequence length of 1305). A 

hyperthermostable α-amylase gene hybridizable to the 
above hyperthermostable α-amylase gene. A process for 

producing a hyperthermostable α-amylase by culturing a 
transformant into which a recombinant plasmid 

containing the above hyperthermostable α-amylase gene 
has been introduced. At pH 5.5, the optimum temperature 

of the enzyme activity is in the range of 70 to 100°C. 
The enzyme activity is entirely maintained even after 

heating at 80°C for 6 hours, and at least 70% of the 

enzyme activity is maintained even after the heating at 
95°C for 6 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DNA encoding a 
hyperthermostable α-amylase useful as an industrial 
enzyme. The α-amylase is being utilized in a variety of 
important industrial processes not only in the food 
industry but also in other various industries, such as 
the alcohol producing and textile industries. A typical 
use of the α-amylase is found in a liquefaction of 
starch to be conducted in a glucose producing process 
for obtaining glucose, which is either processed into a 
sweetener and a nutriment or utilized as a starting 
material for isomerized sugar. The liquefied starch is 
also an important starting material for producing 
cyclodextrin and coupling sugar. Because of low 
solubility in water at medium temperature, starch is 
hardly hydrolyzed with α-amylase. Consequently, 
liquefaction of starch with an α-amylase is generally 
performed by first gelatinizing the starch at a 
temperature as high as about 100°C and then contacting 
the resultant starch with the α-amylase for 
liquefaction. The pH value of the reaction mixture during the 
liquefaction is adjusted to an acidic region in order  
 
to suppress the formation of by-products. Especially, 
when the liquefaction is continuously followed by a 
saccharifying step, it is desired that the liquefaction 
be carried out in an acidic condition suitable for 
having glucoamylase employed in the saccharification 
fully exert its activities. Therefore, it is required 
that the α-amylase for use in the liquefaction of 
starch have high activity even at extremely high 
temperatures and in acidic regions. The liquefaction of starch is performed by the use 
of, for example, α-amylase derived from Bacilluslicheniformis 
(trade name: Termamyl, produced by Novo 
Nordisk) and α-amylase derived from Bacillussubtilis 
(trade name: Speedase, produced by The Nagase & Co., 
Ltd.). Although these are mesophile-derived enzymes, 
their thermostability is relatively high. In this connection, it is anticipated that the 
hyperthermophilic bacteria adapted to high-temperature 
environment might have produced α-amylases having 
increased thermostabilities and being suitable for use 
in the above liquefaction. It is known that hyperthermophile Pyrococcusfuriosus 
and Pyrococcuswoesei produce α-amylases

(1991); FEMS Microbiology Letters, 71 (1-2), 21-26 
(1990); and WO 90/11352].  The use of the above α-amylases derived from 
bacteria of the genus Pyrococcus in
