<ABSTRACT>
An elongate temperature sensor (10) comprises two 
electrical conductors (12,14) having temperature sensitive 

insulating material between them whose resistance and 
capacitance varies with temperature but according to 

respectively different known relationships. An 
alternating waveform (V
in
) is applied across the sensor 
(10) through a known resistor (R
s
). The amplitudes of 
the voltage waveforms developed across the known resistor 

(R
s
) and across the sensor (10) are compared and the 
phase difference between them measured to determine the 

corresponding resistance and capacitance values of the 
sensor (10). The measured value of one parameter is then 

substituted into the respective known relationship to 
produce a corresponding temperature value for the sensor 

(10). This temperature value is then substituted into the 
relationship for the other parameter to calculate a 

notional value for that parameter. If that notional value 
differs from the measured value, this is used to produce 

an indication that the sensor is not being uniformly 
heated but has an overheated sectional part. By means of 

further processing, the length and position of the 
overheated section and its actual temperature can be 

determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a temperature detecting system
comprising an elongate temperature sensor having two
electrical parameters which vary according to respectively
different predetermined relationships with temperature and
measuring means for measuring said parameters.The invention also relates to a temperature detecting method
comprising the steps of deploying an elongate temperature
sensor having two electrical parameters which vary according
to respectively different predetermined relationships with
temperature and measuring said parameters.Such a temperature detecting system and method are known from
US-A-3,059,229. Different electrical characteristics of an
elongate temperature sensitive element are monitored
independently and each characteristic is used to set a
different alarm condition.EP-A-0487,730 discloses a temperature detector in which an
a.c. voltage waveform is applied to an elongate temperature
sensor and a temperature measurement is obtained from the 
phase angle of the sensor output.EP-A-028,142 discloses a fault detecting sensor incorporating
a solid conductive polymer composition which undergoes a
measurable change of capacitance when exposed to excessive
temperature.EP-A-0218,519 discloses a temperature sensitive cable having
a resistance and capacitance whose product is relatively
independent of cable length at a preset alarm temperature.One embodiment of the invention to be described in more detail
below comprises an elongate temperature detector having
distributed electrically insulating material whose parameters
vary with temperature such that measurement of the parameters
enables the detection of changes in temperature along the
detector. In the embodiment to be described, localised
increases in temperature can be distinguished from changes in
average temperature of the detector, and the position of
localised changes in temperature can be detected.According to the invention the temperature detecting system is
characterised by a control unit arranged to calculate from 
one of the measured parameters a value for the other measured
parameter using said predetermined relationships, arranged to
compare the calculated value with the measured value of the
other parameter and arranged to detect in dependence on the
comparison whether the sensor is in a first condition in which
the sensor is subjected to a substantially uniform temperature
change over its total length or in a second condition in which
a section of the sensor is subjected to a localised
temperature change.According
