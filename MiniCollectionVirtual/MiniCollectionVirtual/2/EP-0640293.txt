<ABSTRACT>
A process for blanching or cooking a pasta strand which 
comprises feeding a pasta strand and hot water to the 

inlet of a pipe, conveying the pasta strand and hot water 
through the pipe for blanching or cooking the pasta 

strand, draining water from the blanched or cooked pasta 
strand as it exits from the pipe and recirculating the 

drained water to the inlet of the pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and process 
for blanching or cooking pastas. In the aqueous blanching of pasta strands it is usually 
necessary to transport the pasta strands on conveyor belts 
in a long flat unit about 25 metres long which takes up a 
great deal of space. In the commercial cooking of fresh pasta products, there 
is often used a conveyor system which carries the pasta 
product through a tank of hot water along a submerged 
horizontal zigzag travel path. For example, US.A.2905105 
describes a stack of closely spaced, parallel conveyors 
wherein the top run of the endless belts of adjacent 
conveyors travel in opposite directions. Another type of 
conveyor system comprises a pair of continuous belts which 
are held with a uniform spacing between them during their 
horizontal zigzag travel through the hot water and such 
systems are described in US.A.4522217 and US.A.4752491. 
However, conveyor belts are expensive. They also easily 
become worn or broken especially when travelling through 
hot water, leading to costly breakdowns. In addition, when blanching using the conveyor systems 
described in US.A.4522217 and US.A.4752491 where the pasta 
strand is horizontally conveyed through the blanching tank 
between two parallel zigzag conveyors, there are practical 
difficulties because the pasta strand absorbs water and 
thus gradually expands both in width and in length which 
means that the speed of the strand at the outfeed end of 
the tank should be higher than at the infeed end. However, 
this is impossible to attain since it is the same endless 
conveyors which enter and leave the tank. We have now devised a blanching process for blanching or 
cooking pasta strands which eliminates the use of conveyor  
 
belts during the blanching or cooking step and 
significantly reduces the space required in the factory. According to the present invention there is provided a 
process for blanching or cooking a pasta strand which 
comprises feeding a pasta strand and hot water to the 
inlet of a pipe, conveying the pasta strand and hot water 
through the pipe for blanching or cooking the pasta 
strand, draining water from the blanched or cooked pasta 
strand as it exits from the pipe and recirculating the 
drained water to the inlet of the pipe. The pasta strand may be formed by conventional means, e.g. 
by extruding or by kneading/sheeting/calibrating the pasta 
dough into one or more parallel strands. Conveniently, the 
pasta dough is cut after kneading/sheeting/calibrating or 
extrusi

<CLAIMS>
A process for blanching or cooking a pasta strand which 
comprises feeding a pasta strand and hot water to the 

inlet of a pipe, conveying the pasta strand and hot water 
through the pipe for blanching or cooking the pasta 

strand, draining water from the blanched or cooked pasta 
strand as it exits from the pipe and recirculating the 

drained water to the inlet of the pipe. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the pasta strand 
is formed by extruding or kneading/sheeting/calibrating a 

pasta dough into one or more parallel strands. 
A process according to claim 2 wherein the pasta strand 
or strands formed by kneading/sheeting/calibrating or by 

extruding the pasta dough are cut after extrusion into a 
plurality of strands. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the water that 
is fed to the inlet of the pipe is at a temperature 

suitable for blanching or cooking the pasta strand. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the pipe is 
straight, zigzag or helical shaped. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein when the pasta 
strand exits from the pipe, it is transferred to a meshed 

or perforated conveyor belt on which it is transported and 
which allows the surplus water to drain off. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the drained 
water is collected in a tank from where it is pumped 

through a water pipe back to the inlet of the pipe. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the drained 
water is reheated to the appropriate temperature by 

passing through a heater before it is fed to the inlet of 
the pipe.  

 
A process according to claim 1 wherein after the water 
has been drained off the pasta strand, the pasta strand is 

transported to a cutter where it is cut transversely into 
appropriate lengths. 
A process according to claim 2 wherein the pasta 
strand or strands are conveyed continuously through the 

pipe together with the recirculating water to give a 
continuous process.
