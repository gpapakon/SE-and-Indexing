<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel latent heat
storage material composition suitable for use in air
conditioning systems.Heretofore, latent heat storage materials used in air
conditioning systems which have melting points in the range of 5
to 10°C have been considered useful. Examples of the known
conventional organic compounds having melting points of around 5
to 10°C include tetradecane (C14H30, melting point: 5°C; Japanese
Patent Publication No. 53-24182) and pentadecane (C15H32,
melting point: 9.9°C), etc., which are paraffinic compounds, and
polyethyleneglycol #400 (melting point: 4 to 8°C; Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 62-19968) and 1-decanol (melting
point: 5°C), etc., which are non-paraffinic compounds. However,
these compounds are scarcely used now, as they have low thermal
conductivity and a relatively low heat of melting.On the other hand, several compositions of inorganic
compounds have been reported which are composed of inorganic
salt hydrates having large heat of melting and melting points
of around 5 to 10°C. For example, a binary composition composed
of disodium hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate and dipotassium
hydrogenphosphate hexahydrate (melting point: 5°C; Japanese
Patent Publication No. 52-11061) which has outstanding problems
in the prevention of supercooling and, which therefore, has
faced difficulties in practical use. A ternary composition
composed of sodium sulfate decahydrate, ammonium chloride and 
ammonium bromide (Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-56912),
which although it possesses a melting point of within the range
of 6.3 to 10.1°C, is also not suitable for practical use because
of its insufficient stability in long-term performance.Another ternary composition composed of sodium sulfate
decahydrate, ammonium chloride and sodium chloride is
illustrated in Maria Telkes, SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE (ASHRAE
JOURNAL, SEPTEMBER, 1974), but this composition has been known
to have a melting point of 12.8°C. In addition, a ternary
composition composed of sodium sulphate, water and ammonium
chloride (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2-92988) has
a melting point of within the range of 8.6 to 9.6°C.The preferable melting point of latent heat storage
materials used for air conditioning systems has been considered
to be from 5 to 10°C, and more preferably from 5 to 8°C. However,
when already installed air conditioning systems are used with
insufficient cooling, a conventional water heat-pump (e.g. an
absorption refrigerator) must also be used simultaneously. In
