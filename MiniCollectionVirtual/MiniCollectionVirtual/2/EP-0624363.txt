<ABSTRACT>
Lipid composition for cosmetic products based on a mixture of oils which are chosen so as to maintain a balance between all the classes of lipids capable of affording the essential fatty acids in optimum physiological proportions and of regulating the metabolism of these fatty acids with physiological responses which are desired for the skin. This composition is particularly suitable for aqueous cosmetic compositions such as, for example, creams or milks or anhyrous compositions for care of the body.

Lipidic composition applicable topically for cosmetic
use, characterized in that the fatty acids of the

triglycerides comprise, by weight, 40 to 70 % oleic acid

and 30 to 50 % of polyunsaturated fatty acids, that the
weight ratio of fatty acids of the n-6 family to those of

the n-3 family is 10:1 to 30:1 and that the polyunsaturated
fatty acids include an effective quantity of acids of the

n-3 and n-6 families with a degree of unsaturation of 3 and
more.
Lipidic composition according to claim 1, characterized
in that it contains, by weight, 50 to 70 % of sunflower or

hybrid safflower oil with a high oleic acid content, 20 to
40 % sunflower or grape seed oil, 3 to 10 % rosa mosqueta,

chia or linseed oil and 1 to 10 % black currant seed oil.
Cosmetic composition containing a lipidic composition
according to claim 1 or 2.
Cosmetic composition according to claim 3,
characterized in that it is in the form of a solution, a

water-in-oil emulsion or an oil-in-water emulsion, a
suspension or an aerosol.
Cosmetic composition according to claim 3,
characterized in that it is in the form of a cream or milk.
Cosmetic composition according to claim 3,
characterized in that it is in an anhydrous form, in

particular a balm, a body oil, an anti-sun oil or a
lipstick.
Composition according to one of claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that it also contains at least one

cosmetic additive chosen from the group formed of 
emulsifiers, antiperspirant agents, stabilizers,

preservatives, anti-oxidants, sun filters, perfumes,
colorants, emollients, pearl agents, waxes and organic or

inorganic fillers.
