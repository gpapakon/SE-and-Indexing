 PROCESS FOR THE SELECTIVE HYDROGENATION AND ISOMERIZATION OF HYDROCARBONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention is concerned with a process for the selective hydrogenation and simultaneous isomerization of a hydrocarbon feed stream containing a mixture of hydro- carbons of varying degrees of unsaturation and having 4 or more carbon atoms therein. The process comprises contact¬ ing the hydrocarbon feed stream with hydrogen gas under hydrogenating and isomerizing conditions in the presence of a suitable catalyst in a multi-stage packed bed cata- lytic reactor.The Related ArtThe selective hydrogenation and isomerization of hy¬ drocarbon mixtures containing hydrocarbons with olefinic unsaturation is well-known in the art.U.S. Patent 3,485,887 is directed to the hydrogena¬ tion of C4-hydrocarbon fractions containing n-butene-1 and butadiene by passing such into contact with a hydrogena¬ tion catalyst which is a metal of the Group V-VIII of the Periodic System in the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere. The product which is produced is stated to be high in n- butene and poor in butadiene content. The Patent states that the improvement of simultaneously isomerizing n-bu¬ tene-1 in the fractions and produced in the hydrogenation to n-butene-2, comprises passing the C4-hydrocarbon mix¬ ture in the liquid state downwardly over a fixed bed hy¬ drogenation catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere at an inlet temperature of the C4-hydrocarbon mixture of about 10 to 35°C and at an outlet temperature of the hydrogenated and isomerized product of 60 to 90 C.U.S. Patent 3,764,633 relates to a process and cata¬ lyst for isomerizing olefinic hydrocarbons while simultan¬ eously hydrogenating polyolefinic hydrocarbons. Specific- 

ally, the Patent describes a process for the catalytic isomerization of monoolefinic hydrocarbons having a ter¬ minally-positioned double bond, the hydrocarbons contain¬ ing at least four carbon atoms and being contained in a feedstream. The process comprises contacting a catalyst active for the isomerization of monoolefinic hydrocarbons with carbon monoxide to substantially deactivate the cata¬ lysts. The deactivated catalyst is then contacted with hydrogen to activate the catalyst for monoolefinic hydro- carbon isomerization. The activated catalyst is then con¬ tacted with a feedstream comprising the monoolefinic hy¬ drocarbons to isomerize the same.In column 4, line 68 through column 5, line 2 of this Patent, it is stated that the process may be carried out while introducing

any remaining diolefin to olefin in three points spaced apart along the flow direction of said feed stream through said reactor.
8. The process of claim 1 which is carried out in the liquid and/or vapor-liquid mixed phase.
9. The process of claim 1 wherein the catalyst com¬ prises at least one Group VIII Noble metal on a carrier.
