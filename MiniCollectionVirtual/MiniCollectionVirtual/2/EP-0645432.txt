<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber modified
asphalt type of waterproofing composition. More specifically,
the present invention is concerned with a rubber modified asphalt
type of waterproof composition that is used for the purpose
of shielding buildings and structures for engineering works
against water, moisture and rust, or the filling or other purposes.
Still more specifically, the pesent invention relates to a rubber
modified asphalt type of waterproofing composition that can
be so instantaneously coagulated by a normal temperature spray
waterproofing method that it can form a stable yet tough waterproof
layer.So far, Hotmelt Asphalt waterproofing methods have
often been used for the purpose of making structures for engineering
works and buildings waterproof. However, these methods have
involved many problems such as smelling and fuming, a possibility
of catching fire, and a risk of causing workers to have burns,
because asphalt is melted by heat for use on site.In recent years, these methods have been superseded
by normal temperature waterproofing methods using a rubber
modified asphalt emulsion. One typical method involves spraying
a mixture of a rubber modified asphalt emulsion and a gelatinizing
agent to an application surface to form thereon a rubber modified 
asphalt layer, and another method comprises injecting a rubber
modified asphalt emulsion and a coagulating agent through
separate nozzles onto an application surface while they are
brought into contact mixing with each other in the air, thereby
forming a rubber modified asphalt layer on the application
surface.For instance, reference is made to JP - B 56 - 48652
and 58 - 41107. According to the former, a flow of an asphalt
latex mixture consisting of asphalt or its mixture with oil
and latex, and a flow of mixed emulsion consisting of an aqueous
emulsion made up of at least one of asphalt, oil and latex
and a gelatinizing agent are sprayed onto an application surface
while they are continuously mixed together, thereby forming
thereon a rubber modified asphalt layer, and according to the
latter, an anionic rubber modified asphalt emulsion having a
total solid content exceeding 70 % by weight (usually 80 to
85 % by weight) and a polyvalent metal salt (in the form
of a 1 - 15% by weight aqueous solution) that is a gelatinizing
agent are injected through separate airless type spraying machines
onto an application surface while they are brought into contact
mixing with each other in the air, thereby forming a rubber
modified asphalt
