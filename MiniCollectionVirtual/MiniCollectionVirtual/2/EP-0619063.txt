<ABSTRACT>
The harvester comprises cutting means (5) carried by a 
frame (4), which is suspended in and moveable up and 

down in relation to a carrier frame (2), which is 
designed for being carried by a tractor or which has 

ground wheels (3) and is designed for being towed by a 
tractor. A spring (8) is provided, which at one end is 

fastened in relation to the first frame (4) and at the 
other end is fastened in relation to the carrier frame 

(2) for partly to carry the first frame (4), and there 
is a device (9, 10) for manual adjustment of the tension 

of the spring (8). 
At one end of the spring (8) a scale member (11) is 
fixed with a fixing part and a scale part (15), and at 

the other end of the spring (8) an indicator element 
(13) is fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a harvester of 
the type comprising cutting means carried by a frame, 
which is suspended in and moveable up and down in 
relation to a carrier frame, which is designed for being 
carried by a tractor or which has ground wheels and is 
designed for being towed by a tractor, a spring being 
fixed at one end in relation to the first frame and at 
the other end in relation to the carrier frame to partly 
carry the first frame and a device being provided for 
manual adjustment of the tension of the spring. This is a common construction in for example 
mowing machines for harvesting grass crops 
as shown in US-A-3 474 601. 
The first 
frame may be suspended in the carrier frame by means of 
a parallelogram suspension so that it is freely movable 
up and down. During operation the first frame and the 
cutting means, as for example a cutting board, rests on 
the field with a certain pressure depending on the 
weight of the cutting board, the position of the cutting 
board in relation to the tow frame, the position of the 
tow frame in relation to the tractor, and the preset 
tension of the spring. In order to obtain correct function without 
excessive wear it is important that the pressure on the 
field is kept within certain values. Since the second 
and the third of the above mentioned factors may change 
during operation, it is insufficient to preset the 
tension of the spring once and for all, and readjustments 
of the spring tension must be made 
currently. When a mower is coupled to a tractor, the field 
pressure is adjusted according to a certain procedure. 
However, it is a problem subsequently to check that the 
set field pressure is maintained during operation.  
 The object of the invention is to provide an 
indicator, which the user can watch during operation in 
order to check whether the correct field pressure is 
maintained or whether the spring pre-tension needs 
readjustment. In accordance with the invention this object is 
fulfilled in that a harvester of the type concerned is 
characterized in that at one end of the spring a scale 
member is fixed with a fixing part and a scale part, and 
at the other end of the spring an indicator member is 
fixed. Thereby it is possible for the user during 
operation to watch the position of the indicator member 
in relation to the scale member, since deviations in 
relation to the position after adjustment of the field 
pressure indicates that the spring tension has changed, 
and thereby also the field pressure. In a
