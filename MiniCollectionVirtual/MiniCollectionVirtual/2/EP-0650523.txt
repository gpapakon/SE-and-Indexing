<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to recombinant cell lines, in particular mamalian cell lines, capable of expressing recombinant CDw52 antigen or an antigenic fragment thereof. The cell lines can be used for the production of recombinant CDw52 antigen and in assaying for anti-CDw52 antibody in a sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recombinant CDw52 antigen
which may be used in assaying for, purifying or inducing
anti-CDw52 antibodies.The CAMPATH-1 family of monoclonal antibodies
recognise an antigen expressed on the majority of human
lymphocytes and monocytes (CAMPATH is a Registered Trade
Mark of The Wellcome Foundation Limited). At the Fourth
Leucocyte Workshop these antibodies were given the
provisional designation CDw52. The CDw52 antigen is an
unusually good target for complement-mediated attack and
for this reason the IgM antibody, CAMPATH-1M, has been
widely used for removal of T lymphocytes from donor bone
marrow to prevent graft-versus-host disease.The CDw52 antigen is expressed in most cases of
lymphoid malignancy and serotherapy of lymphoma and
leukaemia with CAMPATH-1 antibodies has therefore been
attempted. The rat IgG2b, CAMPATH-1G, which activates both
complement and cell-mediated killing, has been found to be
rather effective in this context. Recently, a human IgG1
antibody (CAMPATH-1H) with the same specificity has been
constructed by recombinant DNA technology and this can be
administered for a longer period and produces even better
clinical results (see Riechmann et al., Nature, 332,
323-327, (1988) and Hale etal., The Lancet, 2, 1394-1399
(1988)). Campath-1H has proved to be effective for
lymphocyte depletion invivo and is being tested for the
treatment of lymphoma, transplant rejection and various
autoimmune diseases.It is apparent that not all differentiation or tumour
associated antigens are equally good targets for 
serotherapy and the reasons why the CAMPATH-1 antigen is so
good are not yet clear. Its abundant expression (about 5
x 105 molecules per lymphocyte) and lack of modulation are
probably relevant factors but do not provide a complete
explanation since even small (sub-saturating) amounts of
antibody are effective compared with other specificities.Hale et al., (Tissue Antigens, 35, 118 (1990))
reported that about 50% of the CAMPATH-1 antigen could be
removed from peripheral blood lymphocytes by treatment with
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specif ic phospholipase
C (from B. thuringiensis). This shows that at least some
of the antigen is anchored by GPI and possibly all of it
since a similar partial resistance has been observed with
other GPI-linked antigens.Hale et al., also reported that the CAMPATH-1 antigen
can be extracted from cell homogenates into the aqueous
phase of a chloroform:methanol:water system and it can be
detected by Western blotting as a broad band

<CLAIMS>
A cell line capable of expressing CDw52 antigen or an antigenic fragment
thereof in a form capable of being recognised by antibodies raised against the natural

human CDw52 antigen 
characterised in that
 the cell line is a hamster CHO or BHK
cell line containing a recombinant DNA encoding for the CDw52 antigen or antigenic

fragment amino acid sequence in a form capable of expression of said antigen or
fragment.
A method for production of CDw52 antigen or an antigenic fragment thereof
which comprises the steps of:


(i) providing a hamster CHO or BHK host cell line transformed with DNA
encoding the CDw52 antigen or an antigenic fragment thereof in a form capable of

expression; the cell line being capable of processing CDw52 antigen or an antigenic
fragment thereof into a functional form capable of being recognised by antibodies

directed against the natural human CDw52 antigen,
(ii) growing the cell line in a manner such that the CDw52 antigen or the
antigenic fragment thereof is expressed in functional form; and
(iii) recovering the CDw52 antigen or the antigenic fragment thereof.
A method of assaying an anti-CDw52 antibody in a sample, which method
comprises contacting the sample with recombinant CDw52 antigen or an antigenic

fragment thereof, as produced by a method as claimed in Claim 2, and determining
binding of the antibody to the recombinant antigen or fragment thereof.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the binding of the antibody is
determined using a labelled antiglobulin.
A test kit for use in an assay of an anti-CDw52 antibody in a sample which
comprises : 


(a) recombinant CDw52 antigen as produced by a method as claimed in Claim
2 and
(b) means for the quantitative or qualitative determination of binding of an
immunoglobulin to the antigen following contact of the antigen with the sample.
