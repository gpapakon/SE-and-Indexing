<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a fiber amplifier including a gain fiber and 
a source of pump power having a wavelength λ
p
 coupled to one 
end thereof. A signal of wavelength λ
s
 is introduced into a 
first end of the gain fiber, and an amplified signal of 

wavelength λ
s
 is coupled from the second end thereof. The 
signal
 can traverse an undesired secondary path as well as a 
preferred primary path to the amplifier output. To prevent 

light of wavelength λ
s
 from traversing the secondary path and 
thus increasing the amplifier noise figure, the amplifier 

includes attenuating fiber means for attenuating that portion 
of the signal of wavelength λ
s
 that propagates in the 
secondary path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a doped optical fiber 
amplifier having an improved amplifier noise figure. Doped optical fiber amplifiers such as those disclosed 
in EP-A-0504479 consist of an optical fiber the core of 
which contains a dopant such as rare earth ions. Such an 
amplifier receives an optical signal of wavelength λs and 
pump power of wavelength λp which are combined by means such 
as one or more pump/signal wavelength division multiplexer 
(WDM) couplers located at one or both ends of the 
amplifier. The introduced signal traverses a preferred, 
designated path from the input means through the gain fiber 
means to the output end of the gain fiber means, whereby an 
amplified signal of wavelength λs appears at the output end 
of the amplifier. One of the key characteristics of a fiber optic 
amplifier is its noise figure, which is the ratio of the 
signal-to-noise ratio at the amplifier input and the 
signal-to-noise ratio at the amplifier output when the 
input noise is shot noise only. The noise figure 
characterizes the amount of noise the fiber amplifier adds 
to the signal. A signal is input to the amplifier and 
follows a primary signal path to the amplifier output. 
Fundamental unavoidable noise is generated in this direct 
path by spontaneous emission produced by the gain fiber and 
gives rise to a minimum noise figure. Excess noise is 
generated in the amplifier when a portion of the signal 
follows a second path and arrives at the output at some 
time delay relative to the signal in the primary path, 
thereby generating multi-path interference. One potential 
second path is a path formed by signals that experience two 
reflections somewhere inside the amplifier. In most 
amplifiers the  
 
largest source of reflections is the facets and coupling 
lenses of the pump lasers. Signal light reaches the pump 
laser facets due to the less than infinite isolation of the 
pump/signal WDM coupler. If the signal can be prevented from 
reaching the laser facet, the principal source of reflection 
within the amplifier can be removed, and the noise figure can 
be significantly reduced. Multi-path interference also occurs in two stage 
amplifiers wherein residual pump power from the output of the 
first stage is coupled to the second stage by a pump path that 
is distinct from the signal path but which, due to poor 
isolation, propagates a small amount of signal. The signal 
component reaching the second stage via the pump path is 
delayed and out of phase with the direct signal and therefore
