<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a resinous dental composition,
which is self-curing, photochemically or thermally curable in
the presence of initiators, based on polymerisable
polysiloxanes, to a process for its preparation and to its use
for the preparation of pasty dental materials, which are self-curing,
photochemically or thermally curable in the presence of
initiators, which are composed of one or more resinous dental
compositions and optionally of one or more finely divided
fillers and/or customary additives. Suitable additives are, for
example, pigments, stabilisers, plasticisers or impact strength
enhancers.The term "dental material" includes, for example,
filling materials for looking after carious defects or other
dental defects in the oral cavity, inlays, crown and bridge
materials, facings, sealing and protective coating
compositions, synthetic fixing materials for fixing inlays or
crowns and bridges, stump building-up materials, prosthetic
materials, compositions for the production of artificial teeth,
and adhesion promoters for dental filling materials.Customary resinous dental compositions as a rule
function as binders for the production of dental materials and
contain at least one monomeric ester of methacrylic acid, but
usually a mixture of several such esters. Suitable
monofunctional esters of methacrylic acid are, for example,
methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isopropyl
methacrylate, n-hexyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate.Recently, polyfunctional esters of methacrylic acid
with relatively high molecular weights have commonly been 
employed, such as, for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate,
butanediol 1,4-dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol
dimethacrylate, dodecanediol-1, 12-dimethacrylate, dodecanediol
1,10-dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate,
pentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, trimethylolpropane
trimethacrylate, 2,2-bis[p-( γ -meth-acryloxy-β-hydroxypropoxy)
-phenyl]-propane, 2,2-bis[p -(β-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]propane
dimethacrylate (bis-GMA), the diadduct of
hydroxyethyl methacrylate and trimethylhexamethylene
diisocyanate and the diadduct of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and
isophorone diisocyanate.Materials based on, for example, methyl methacrylate,
which are used as prosthetic bases, crown and bridge resins or
as filling resins, do present outstanding advantages with
respect to their workability, their aesthetic appearance and their
stability in the oral area. However, since these materials
have poor mechanical strengths, it may happen that a breakage
