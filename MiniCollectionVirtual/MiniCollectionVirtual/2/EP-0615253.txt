<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a semiconductor memory with which 
the duty ratio of column selection lines can be raised 

as well as that of word lines so that the word lines and 
the column selection lines of the semiconductor memory 

may be subjected to a screening test along with the 
peripheral circuits under a same condition for all these 

components (in terms of electric field and time) while 
operating the peripheral circuits. The semiconductor 

memory comprises a memory circuit (10) including a 
memory cell array (1) and its peripheral circuits, a 

first circuit for selecting some of the word lines (WL) 
of the memory cell array, the first means being so 

adapted to select a greater number of word lines for a 
voltage stress test mode than for a normal operation 

mode and a second circuit for selecting some of the column 
selection lines CSL to thereby select the corresponding 

columns of the memory cell array, the second 
means being so adapted to select a greater number of 

column selection lines for a voltage stress test mode 
than for a normal operation mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
and, more particularly, it relates to a semiconductor
memory provided with a built-in voltage stress test mode
capable of testing the voltage stress applied thereto.Conventionally, a normal access mode is used for a
voltage stress test such as a burn in test utilizing an
accelerating voltage or temperature to be conducted on a
dynamic type semiconductor memory (DRAM) in the course
of manufacturing. Such a test is time consuming when a
screening operation is carried out to a satisfactory
extent by utilizing an accelerating voltage. This is
because, while the memory cell transfer gate shows the
largest electric field strength in the internal circuit
of a DRAM, the duty ratio of the electric field at the
transfer gate is too small in a normal operation mode of
the device.There have been proposed a couple of time saving
burn-in test techniques respectively called a DC (direct
current) burn in test mode and an AC (alternating
current) burn-in test mode in an attempt to reduce the
time required for a burn-in test.The former technique consists in applying a high
voltage simultaneously to a plurality of word lines of
the memory cell array of a DRAM in order to increase the
duty ratio of the electric field at the memory cell
transfer gate. The latter technique, on the other hand, consists
in dividing the word lines of the memory cell array of
a DRAM into two groups, a group with odd numbers and
another with even numbers, selecting either of them
and applying a high voltage to the word lines of the
selected group. Thus, a high voltage is applied to
every other word line of the device. This technique is
advantageous in that the insulation between adjacent
word lines and bit lines can also be checked during the
screening.In an alternative technique of utilizing an AC
burn-in test mode, every forth word line is selected by
utilizing the row address counter for CBR (CAS before
RAS) automatic refreshing while the DRAM is held under
an operating condition so that it may be used even if
the device is sealed in a package.However, while the above described techniques can
raise the duty ratio of the electric field applied to
the word lines of a DRAM, the duty ratio at the transistor
for the column selection lines and the column selection
gate (DQ gate) connected thereto remains low.Additionally, although the circuits peripheral to
the memory cells can be screened in a reading operation
by using a conventional screening technique, they cannot
be screened in a writing
