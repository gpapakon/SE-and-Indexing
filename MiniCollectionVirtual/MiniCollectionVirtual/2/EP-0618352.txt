<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic tappet 1 includes a cam sliding 
portion 2, a skirt portion 3 and a spring holding 

portion 4. At least the cam sliding portion 2 is made 
of ceramic and oil is held in the spring holding 

portion 4. There is thus provided a hydraulic tappet 
capable of efficiently using motive power from a crank 

shaft, reducing transmission loss and improving the 
efficiency of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tappet for a
valve mechanism for an internal combustion engine, for
example, an engine for an automobile, and more
particularly to a hydraulic tappet capable of improving
the efficiency of the engine for an automobile.An internal combustion engine, such as an
engine for an automobile, has a tappet or a rocker arm
disposed at an end of a valve shaft to transmit the
kinetic force of a cam to a valve mechanism. Thermal
expansion or thermal shrinkage of a cylinder head or a
valve occurring at the time of the operation and
incomplete seating of the valve occurring due to wear
of the valve or a valve seat are prevented and the
kinetic characteristics of the valve system are
improved by disposing a hydraulic or mechanical
adjustment mechanism at the location at which the
tappet or the rocker arm is in contact with the end of
the valve shaft.Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a conventional
tappet 10 of a hydraulic adjustment type. If a
cylinder head (omitted from the illustration) or a
valve 18 undergoes thermal expansion or thermal
shrinkage, the hydraulic pressure in an oil reservoir
16 disposed in the metal tappet 10 is used to adjust 
the position of the spring portion of the tappet for
pressing the valve so that the transmission
characteristics from a cam 17 are compensated.As shown in Fig. 3, an upwardly projecting
annular flange 20 of the base wall of the tappet
receives a cup-shaped member 21 which is fixed on the
end of the stem or push-rod of the valve 18. Within
the cup-shaped member 21 there is a sliding piston
member 22 upwardly biased by a spring 23. When the cam
sliding surface 12 is pushed down by the cam, the
hydraulic pressure in the reservoir 16 is increased,
and the valve stem is pushed down via the cup-shaped
member 21 to open the valve. The oil in the reservoir
16 is not change during the operation of the tappet.However, a conventional tappet of the foregoing
hydraulic adjustment type involves generation of
excessively large frictional force when the cam 17
slides on the cam sliding surface 12 of the metal
tappet 10 as shown in Fig. 3. As a result, there
arises a problem in that the crankshaft must bear an
excessively heavy load, and therefore the efficiency of
the engine deteriorates.Moreover, the employed mechanism, in which oil
is enclosed in the tappet, means that the oil reservoir
occupies a large part of the inside of the tappet, and
the weight of the tappet is increased excessively, so 
that the transmission loss occurring due to the
vertical motion

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic tappet for a valve mechanism of an
internal combustion engine, said hydraulic tappet

comprising component elements in the form of a cam
sliding portion (2), a skirt portion (3) and a spring

holding portion (4) projecting downwardly below the cam
sliding portion (2), wherein all three of said component

elements are formed as a unitary ceramic body, and said
spring holding portion (4) has an oil-holding space,

characterized by an oil supply port (5) that extends
from said oil-holding space of the spring holding

portion (4) to said skirt portion (3) to provide a
conduit for oil to pass between said oil-holding space

and the exterior of the tappet.
A hydraulic tappet according to claim 1, wherein
said oil supply port (5) is a metal pipe.
