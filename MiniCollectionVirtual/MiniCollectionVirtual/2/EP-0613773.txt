A multilayer composite film consisting of an outer layer A, a gas barrier layer
C, a heat sealing layer D and of adhesive or bonding layers B which may be

necessary, characterised in that the individual layers are arranged as follows in
the composite film:


A a biaxially stretched, white opaque polypropylene film,
B optionally an adhesive or bonding layer,
C a gas barrier layer, which has a permeability to oxygen of 30 Ncm

 d
bar at most (23Â°C/0 % relative humidity), and which consists of

polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene terephthalate and which is optionally
monoaxially or biaxially drawn and is optionally provided with a barrier

layer lacquer coating or a transparent vapour-deposited barrier layer
coating, or which consists of a combination of PA and EVOH in layers

or of a monoaxially drawn polyamide or of monoaxially drawn

mixtures of PA and EVOH,
B optionally an adhesive or bonding layer,
D a heat sealing layer,

wherein layers A and C are optionally interchangeable.
A multilayer composite film according to claim 1, characterised in that the
outer layer A is a biaxially stretched, white opaque polypropylene film which

comprises at least three layers. 
A multilayer composite film according to either one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the heat sealing layer D predominantly consists of a

polyolefine homopolymer or a polyolefine copolymer and mixtures or co-extrusions
of these materials, or of an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate

homo- or copolymer.
A multilayer composite film according to either one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the heat sealing layer is made of an amorphous, impact-resistant

modified material which predominantly consists of a polyethylene
terephthalate homo- or copolymer and which is distinguished in that the

maximum secant modulus of films made of this material is 1800 N/mm
2
.
A multilayer composite film according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in that
the heat sealing layer is designed so that it is sealed fixedly to or can be peeled

off from a second film.
A multilayer composite film according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the aforementioned films A, C and D are each bonded to

their adjacent layers via an adhesive layer comprising a two-component
polyurethane adhesive or a polyolefine bonding agent.
A multilayer composite film according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the heat sealing layer D is optionally bonded to the

adjacent layer without an adhesive layer by extrusion coating.
A multilayer composite film according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the composite film is printed.
The use of the multilayer composite film according to any one of claims 1 to 8
for the packaging of foods.
