<ABSTRACT>
Supported catalysts, obtainable by   a) dissolving a catalytically active component or precursor compound thereof in a solvent, b) adding to the solution thus obtained an organic polymer which has the ability to bind at least ten times its own weight of water, c) subsequent mixing of the polymer with a catalyst support material,     d) shaping the composition thus obtained, drying and calcination, a process for the production thereof and use thereof.

A supported catalyst, in which the predominant part of the
active components is present in the macropores having a diameter

above 100 nm, obtainable by

a) dissolving a catalytically active component or its intermediate
in a solvent,
b) adding an organic polymer which is capable of binding at
least ten times its own weight of water to the solution

thus obtained, so that, with swelling, the polymer completely
absorbs this solution,
c) then mixing the polymer with a catalyst carrier,
d) molding the material thus obtained, drying and calcining.
A supported catalyst as claimed in claim 1, for the preparation
of which water or a mixture of water and ammonia is used

as the solvent.
A supported catalyst as claimed in claim 1 or 2, for the
preparation of which a crosslinked sodium polya
crylate is
used as the organic polymer.
A supported catalyst as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, for
the preparation of which a water-soluble palladium salt is

used as an intermediate for the active component.
A process for the preparation of a supported catalyst as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein 


a) a catalytically active component or its intermediate is
dissolved in a solvent,
b) an organic polymer which is capable of binding at least
ten times its own weight of water is added to the solution

thus obtained,
c) the polymer is mixed with a catalyst carrier,
d) the material thus obtained is molded, dried and calcined.
Use of a supported catalyst as claimed in claim 4 for the
selective hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds.
A process for the selective hydrogenation of butyne, butadiene
or mixtures of these compounds to butene, wherein the

hydrogenation is carried out over a supported catalyst as
claimed in claim 1.
A process for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to
ethylene, wherein the hydrogenation is carried out over a

supported catalyst as claimed in claim 1.
A process for the selective hydrogenation of methylacetylene,
propadiene or mixtures of these compounds to propene, wherein

the hydrogenation is carried out over a supported catalyst as
claimed in claim 1.
