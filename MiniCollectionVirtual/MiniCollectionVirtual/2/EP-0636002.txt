<ABSTRACT>
A salt product comprising particles of NaCl, K/Mg-double salts and optionally KCl homogeneously distributed throughout each particle and having a molar ratio of K to Mg  
>
/=  1. The product may be obtained from an aqueous salt mixture, preferably a solution containing the desired proportion of salt ions and having a water content of 50 to 90% by weight by subjecting the aqueous salt mixture to instant drying at a temperature of 70 to 200  DEG C for a period of 1 to 60 seconds to obtain a dry product. The product is usable as a low sodium substitution for common salt in connection with the preparation of food, beverages or pharmaceutical products and/or as a preservative or water binding agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a salt product comprising 
NaCl, K/Mg-double salt and optionally KCl, wherein 
the molar ratio of K to Mg is ≧ 1, a method for the 
preparation thereof and the use thereof as a substitute 
for ordinary salt in connection with the preparation of 
food, beverages or pharmaceutical products and/or as a 
preservative or water binding agent including use as a 
table salt. Common salt, i.e. sodium chloride, is the additive most 
frequently used in food and beverage preparation both for 
household and industrial use. It is necessary to consume 
a certain amount of sodium ions and chloride ions with 
the food, but the intake of sodium chloride is usually 
much larger than the minimum required to maintain the 
salt balance of the body. To people suffering from certain diseases, such as increased 
blood pressure, large amounts of NaCl-intake are 
considered to be injurious. Furthermore, a large intake 
of sodium ions can displace the balance between sodium 
and potassium in the body. Therefore, in order to control the intake of salt, it has 
been proposed to use various salt combinations, wherein 
sodium chloride has been partially replaced by other 
salts, especially potassium chloride. Replacement of sodium chloride by other chemical compounds  
 
entails several disadvantages, inter alia a taste 
deterioration due to the fact that only sodium chloride 
can provide the correct salty taste sensation. It is 
possible to use additives which conceal or disguise this 
deviation in taste, but only a few additives are acceptable 
for use in food products. 
The more the amount of sodium chloride in the salt product 
is decreased, the greater is the taste deviation 
problem. A further problem is that when various pulverulent compounds 
are intermixed, the mixture will easily become 
inhomogeneous, especially if it consists of grains of 
different sizes and densities, which may result in unexpected 
and unpleasant taste sensations. The problem is 
particularly distinct when the salt mixture is to be 
dispensed from a caster. Storing for long periods of time 
may cause stratification of the product which increases 
this problem. WO 86/05954 (Sundien) describes a mineral salt product 
containing mineral salts in the same relative proportions 
as in ocean water, apart from a reduced content of sodium 
chloride. This product contains trace minerals which are 
considered important for the human health. However, the 
product has a relatively high content of hygroscopic and 
bitter magnesium
