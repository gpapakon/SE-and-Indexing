<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a cleaning solution 
used to wash a semiconductor substrate surface. This 

cleaning solution contains these components: a liquid 
mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide to remove 

organic and inorganic residues; fluorosulfuric acid for 
generation of fluorine which serves as an etchant to remove 

other residues and particles; and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to semiconductor 
device fabrication, and more particularly to a cleaning 
technique used to remove contaminants such as organic residues, 
inorganic residues, other residues, and particles from 
a surface of a semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor wafer size has recently changed from 
6 inches to 8 inches, and now to 12 inches, which results in 
increasing cleaning costs involved in cleaning semiconductor 
wafers having such a large diameter. Since semiconductor 
device dimensions have been reduced to submicron regions, 
the process of cleaning must be carried out, with no residues 
nor particles left on a semiconductor substrate surface. FIGURE 8 shows conventional semiconductor substrate cleaning 
equipment. In FIGURE 8, a first cleaning bath 14a and a second 
cleaning bath 14b are shown each of which may contain a heater 
depending on the cleaning solution type used. 15a is a 
first water-washing bath. 15b is a second water-washing 
bath. Nothing but deionized water is supplied to both the 
first water-washing bath 15a and the second water-washing 
bath 15b. The first cleaning bath 14a and the first water-washing 
bath 15a serve in pair. The second cleaning bath 
14b and the second water-washing bath 15b serve in pair.  
 
Plural such pairs are arranged in the order in which they 
are used. 16 is a dry means such as a spin dryer. 17 is a 
loader. 18 is an unloader. A cleaning technique based on the above-described 
semiconductor device cleaning equipment is explained. The first cleaning bath 14a holds a first cleaning 
solution with a 5 : 1 ratio of sulfuric acid : hydrogen 
peroxide. The temperature of the first cleaning solution is 
about 130°C. On the other hand, the second cleaning bath 
14b holds a second cleaning solution with a 1 : 1: 5 ratio 
of ammonium hydroxide: hydrogen peroxide : water. The 
temperature of the second cleaning solution is about 70 °C. A semiconductor substrate carrier is carried into the 
first cleaning bath 14a. In the first cleaning bath 14a, a 
semiconductor substrates held by the carrier are washed for 
removal of contaminants (e.g., residual photoresists). 
Then, the carrier is moved into the first water-washing bath 
15a for removal of the first cleaning solution. Next, the carrier is carried into the second cleaning 
bath 14b where particles on the semiconductor substrate 
surface are removed. Thereafter, the carrier is moved into 
the second water-washing bath 15b for removal of the second 
cleaning solution. Then, the
