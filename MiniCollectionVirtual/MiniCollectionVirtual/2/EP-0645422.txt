<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compositions of 
matter. More particularly, novel polycarbonate blends 
which contain phosphorus compounds and siloxane 
copolymers are disclosed. Said polycarbonate blends 
unexpectedly retain high glass transition temperatures, 
high impact resistances as well as flame retardant 
properties. Polycarbonates are a well known class of high 
impact resistant thermoplastic resins characterized by 
optical clarity, high ductility as well as other advantageous 
properties. They are frequently employed as lenses and 
windows as a result of their transparency. Bisphenol A 
polycarbonate (BPA) is the predominant commercially 
available resin of this type. It is derived from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 
and ordinarily has a glass transition 
temperature of about 150°C. It is of increasing interest to prepare 
polycarbonates which, while retaining the ductility of 
bisphenol A polycarbonates, have higher glass transition 
temperatures and are therefore more resistant to softening 
when heated. Moreover, there is demand for polycarbonates 
which possess flame retardant properties and high impact 
strengths since they are, for instance, conventionally used 
in the automotive, electrical and computer industries. 
Several flame retardant agents have been utilized in an 
attempt to produce flame retardant polycarbonates. For  
 
example, alkali metal salts of strong sulfonic acids are 
commonly used. However, when incorporated into the 
polycarbonate, the resulting polymer is hydrolytically 
sensitive. Further, when using these salts, it is necessary 
to employ drip inhibitors or gas phase flame retardant 
agents. This is not ideal since drip inhibitors may destroy 
the clarity of the polymer and gas phase retardants are 
often halogenated which creates problems with corrosion 
and toxicity. As an alternative to the above, phosphorus 
containing compounds have been used. When blended with a 
base polycarbonate, some flame retardant properties are 
observed. However, the resulting polymer blends are not 
desirable since they possess low glass transition 
temperatures (Tg) and low impact resistances when 
compared to base resins deplete of the phosphorus 
containing compounds. The instant invention, therefore, is based on the 
discovery of novel polycarbonate blends. Said polycarbonate 
blends contain phosphorus compounds and siloxane 
copolymers and they unexpectedly retain high glass 
transition temperatures, high impact resistances as well as 
flame retardant properties. Moreover,
