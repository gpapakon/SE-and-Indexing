<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a composition suitable for topical 
application to human skin is disclosed. Th
e process comprises mixing 
particles of metallic oxide dispersed in oil and having a primary 

particle size less than 0.2 micrometre with one or more emulsifiers, an 
aqueous phase and a hydrophilic organic sunscreen so as to prepare an 

emulsion. The composition contains up to 10 per cent by weight 
metallic oxide and up to 7 per cent by weight hydrophilic organic 

sunscreen. The emulsions are useful as sunscreen compositions, skin 
protectants, moisturisers, and after-sun lotions. The measured Sun 

Protection Factor for a composition of the invention is considerably 
higher than would be expected from a knowledge of the individual UV 

absorbing characteristics of the metallic oxide and the hydrophilic 
organic sunscreen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compositions for application to human 
skin and particularly to compositions containing a combination of 
inorganic and organic sunscreens. The use of inorganic oxides which have a particle size such that 
they are substantially transparent to visible light but reflect or absorb 
UV light to provide sunscreen compositions is known. However, in 
order to produce a sunscreen composition having a high sun protection 
factor (SPF) it is sometimes necessary to use relatively large amounts 
of such oxides and this can lead to undesirable visible tinting due to the 
small absorbance of visible light. 
GB-A-2 206 282 discloses compositions for topical 
application containing titanium dioxide and mica dispersed 
in a topical carrier. UV blockers are optionally 
present.  
 A combination of an inorganic oxide and an organic sunscreen 
can be used to obtain a high SPF with a relatively small amount of 
inorganic oxide but physiological damage to the body can occur 
following topical application of organic sunscreens in effective 
concentrations and consequently safety limits have been imposed on 
the quantity which is permitted in a composition for topical 
application. It is therefore desirable to produce compositions which optimise 
the effectiveness of compounds used as UV absorbers and it is an 
object of this invention to provide a method of preparing compositions 
which improve the effectiveness of a combination of inorganic and 
organic UV absorbers and in which compositions the amount of 
organic UV absorber is minimised. According to the invention a process for the preparation of a 
composition suitable for topical application to human skin comprises 
mixing a dispersion in an oil of particles of a metallic oxide having an 
average primary particle size of less than 0.2 micrometre with one or 
more emulsifiers and an aqueous phase under conditions in which an 
emulsion is formed and with a hydrophilic organic sunscreen wherein 
the composition contains up to 10 per cent by weight metallic oxide 
and up to 7 per cent by weight hydrophilic organic sunscreen. Compositions prepared according to the process of the 
invention have been shown to possess an SPF which is considerably 
greater than would be expected by calculating an SPF based on the 
additive effect of the metallic oxide and the organic sunscreen.  
 The emulsion which is formed by the process of the invention 
can be an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion and the 
skilled person will readily be able to adjust
