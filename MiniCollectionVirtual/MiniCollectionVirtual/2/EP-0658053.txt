<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for reproducing 
a time-varying image by decoding 

image data generated by predictive 
coding. The apparatus is provided 

with a frame memory (46) 
having a storage capacity for three 

frames and storing the image data 
on I picture, P picture, and B picture 

reproduced by an adder (45) in 
accordance with the write addresses 

by an address generator (52). By 
a motion compensator (47), the image 

data on the I picture or P picture 
stored in this frame memory (46) 

are read as image data on a predicted 
picture for decoding, and supplied to 

the adder (45). At the same time, the 
image data are read from the frame 

memory (46) in the order of display 
by the raster addresses generated by 

a frame memory display controller 
(53). Compared to the conventional 

apparatuses, it is possible to make the 
storage capacity of the frame memory 

(46) smaller, and reduce the cost. 
Further, the write and read of the image 

data in and from the frame memory 
(46) are lagged by approximately 

one field from the starting time of writing the image data on the current frame in the frame memory (46), and the 

image data on the current frame are read and output in the order of display. At the same time, the starting time of 
writing the image data on the current frame in the frame memory (46) is set after the eight horizontal scanning periods 

from the terminating time of the vertical blanking between the first field and second field of the previous frame. The 
ending time of writing the image data on the current frame in the frame memory (46) is set before eight horizontal 

scanning periods from the starting time of the vertical blanking between the first field and second field of the current 
frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a moving picture decoding
apparatus, and more particularly to a moving picture decoding
apparatus for decoding coded data obtained by predictive
coding to reproduce original picture data.Hitherto, for example, in a system for transmitting video
signals of moving picture to remote places like television
conference system, or television telephone system, etc., or a
system for recording video signals of moving picture onto a
picture recording medium such as optical disc, magnetic disc or
magnetic tape, etc. and reproducing recorded video signals of
moving picture, in order to efficiently utilize transmission path
or recording medium, a video signal is caused to undergo so
called efficient coding by making use of line correlation or
frame correlation that the video signal has to reduce
redundancies in the space axis direction and in the time axis
direction to transmit only significant information, thus to
improve transmission efficiency.For example, in encoding in the space axis direction
(hereinafter referred to as intra-frame coding), as shown in FIG. 
1A, e.g., line correlation of video signal is utilized. In the
case of transmitting respective pictures (frames) PC1, PC2, PC3
··· constituting a moving picture at times t1, t2, t3 ···,
picture data to be subjected to transmission processing is
one-dimensionally encoded, e.g., within the same scanning line,
or e.g., picture is divided into a plurality of blocks to
two-dimensionally encode picture data of respective blocks to
thereby carry out data compression, thus to improve transmission
efficiency.Moreover, in encoding in the time axis direction
(hereinafter referred to as inter-frame encoding), correlation
between frames (pictures) of video signal is utilized to carry
out, e.g., so called predictive coding. Namely, as shown in FIG.
1B, picture data PC12, PC23 ··· comprised of differences (so
called predictive errors) of picture data every corresponding
pixels between pictures PC1 and PC2, PC2 and PC3 ··· adjacent in
succession are determined to transmit these picture data PC12,
PC23 ··· to thereby carry out data compression, thus to improve
transmission efficiency.Thus, as compared to the case where all picture data of
pictures PC1, PC2, PC3 ··· are transmitted, it is possible to
transmit video signals by remarkably lesser data quantity.Further, in the predictive coding in the above-described
inter-frame coding, in order to provide higher efficiency, motion
compensated predictive coding is used. Namely, an approach is 
employed
