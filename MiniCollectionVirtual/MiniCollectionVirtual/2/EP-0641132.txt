<ABSTRACT>
Binocular parallax of a captured image is detected, and 
image pickup cameras are controlled so that their optic axes 

converge at an optimum point to ensure that the parallax of 
the captured image comes within the binocular fusing range 

of a viewer. Further, an optimum fixating point is 
calculated that enables the viewer to perceive the 

stereoscopic depth of the object over the widest possible 
range, and control is performed so that the fixating point 

is reproduced at a surface of a stereoscopic image display 
or at a designated distance from the surface. This 

suppresses the unnatural feel when the viewer views 
stereoscopic images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stereoscopic image
pickup apparatus for recording and displaying a
stereoscopic image of an object.An example of a prior art stereoscopic image pickup
apparatus is shown in Figure 10.The apparatus shown comprises two ordinary cameras
mounted on two separate universal heads, the two cameras
corresponding to the left and right eyes of a human. The
cameras are secured to rotation controllers 3 and 4,
respectively, so that they are rotatable in a horizontal
plane. The spacing between the two cameras is adjustable on
a camera spacing controller 5. The entire camera
construction is supported on a tripod 6. Top plan views of
this prior art stereoscopic image pickup apparatus are given
in Figures 11(a) and 11(b): (a) shows the apparatus in a
parallel shooting position where the optic axes of the
cameras are set parallel to each other, and (b) illustrates 
a converging shooting position where the optic axes of the
cameras are tilted so that they intersect each other. The
rotation controllers 3 and 4 are operated to rotate the
respective cameras and set them in the parallel shooting or
the converging shooting position. The camera spacing is
adjustable by varying Wc. In shooting an object in three
dimensions, the camera spacing Wc and the distance dx to the
converging point greatly affect the quality of the resulting
stereoscopic image. The camera spacing Wc affects the size
of the object to be displayed as well as the amount of the
horizontal parallax to be reproduced. The distance dx to
the converging point has a significant effect on the
distortion of the recorded image as well as on the amount of
the horizontal parallax (which affects the binocular fusing
range of the viewer). In the prior art stereoscopic image
pickup apparatus, the camera spacing Wc and the distance dx
to the converging point are set by an operator based on his
experience so that the recorded image can be perceived
properly when viewed by a viewer. Here, "perceived
properly" essentially means bringing the horizontal parallax
of the stereoscopic image within the fusing range of the
viewer's eyes when the image is viewed by the viewer. The
fusing range will be explained in further detail in the
preferred embodiments of the present invention. Figure 12
is a schematic diagram of a prior art stereoscopic image 
display apparatus for reproducing a stereoscopic image
signal recorded by the stereoscopic image pickup apparatus.
In the display apparatus, two separate images, one for each
eye, recorded by the
