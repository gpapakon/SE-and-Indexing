<ABSTRACT>
Synergistic combinations of secondary 
antioxidants involving dilauryl thiodipropionate 

and tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite are provided for 
stabilizing thermoplastic resins such as ABS 

graft copolymer resin. The resulting 
compositions exhibit improved stability over 

compositions comprising only one of the secondary 
antioxidants alone. The composition exhibits 

enhanced levels of thermooxidative stability even 
in the absence of primary antioxidants such as 

phenolic antioxidants. The compositions are 
useful as thermoplastic molding compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric
compositions comprising a thermoplastic resin
vinyl aromatic/alkenyl cyanide/diene rubber graft
copolymer and a stabilizer system for protection
of the polymeric compositions against degradation
caused by exposure to heat and oxygen. More
particularly, it relates to compositions
comprising ABS resins
(acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) and the like
containing synergistic stabilizer systems.The compositions of this invention find a
wide variety of commercial applications as
engineering plastics and structural and
functional plastics in numerous end-product
applications.The tendency of ABS-type products to
deteriorate under the influence of long exposures
to heat and oxidation is evidenced by
discoloration.ABS resins comprise rubber-modified
thermoplastic resins and include graft copolymers
of rubbery compositions with acrylonitrile and
styrene monomers. The term "graft copolymer" as
is known (Journal of Polymer Science, volume 8, 
page 260, 1962) signifies resins resulting from a
process wherein a substrate composition such as a
diene rubber which contains unsaturation is
subjected to polymerization with a monomer or
mixture of monomers whereby pendant chains
(grafts) are formed on the substrate. The
molecules therefore of the resulting graft
copolymer consist of two or more polymeric parts
which result from the polymerization of a rubbery
substrate with monomeric materials as indicated.Stabilized ABS resin compositions are known,
see Japanese Patent JP 85008710 issued March 5,
1985, which disclosed adding 0.1 to 5 weight
percent of a composition comprising ingredients
such as (a) 2,3'-methylene bis(4-methyl-6-tertbutylphenol
(b) dilauryl thiodipropionate and
distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite.Stabilized thermoplastic resin compositions
are provided which comprise a thermoplastic resin
such as ABS resin, and a system which comprises
synergistic combination of secondary
antioxidants. The secondary antioxidants are
thioesters and organic phosphites, preferably
dilauryl thiodipropionate and tris(nonyl phenyl)
phosphite. The compositions are synergistically
stabilized by the system, and thus are free of
phenolic
antioxidants and aromatic amine antioxidants.
The absence of phenolic antioxidants may provide
secondary advantages such as elimination of color
bodies yielded by such phenolics.Stabilized thermoplastic resin compositions
are provided comprising a thermoplastic resin 
such as an ABS resin and a stabilizer system
comprising a synergistic combination of secondary
ant
