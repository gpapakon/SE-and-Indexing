<ABSTRACT>
A filler valve (22) and fitting (82) for a gas spring (20). The 
filler valve has a body (80) slidably received in a cavity in a 

housing and movable between a first sealed position for retaining 
gas within a gas chamber in the spring and a second position 

for bleeding gas from the chamber (30) to relieve pressure within 
the chamber. For charging the chamber (30) with gas, a core valve (84) 

is carried by the body (80). Preferably, the housing has an exterior 
configuration and size of a standard flow-through type coupling 

having a pair of exteriorly threaded portions (100,106) separated by a 
central portion with parallel flats (108) constructed and arranged 

for engagement by a tool to install and remove the housing (82). The 
body has opposed effective areas with the effective area adjacent 

an inlet in the housing being greater than the effective area 
adjacent the outlet for enabling gas within the chamber to be 

compressed to a pressure much greater than the supply line 
pressure. Preferably the ratio of effective areas ranges from 

about 4:1 to 8:1 and preferably about 6:1 to enable the gas in 
the chamber to be compressed up to a pressure of about six times 

the supply line pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas springs and more 
particularly to a filler valve for a gas spring. Gas springs are typically utilized to yieldingly 
resist movement of a body such as a clamping ring for a 
metal blank in a die in a press for forming sheet metal 
parts. These springs are generally constructed with an 
actuating rod connected to a piston or head slidably 
received in a cylinder having a chamber that is charged 
through a filler valve in the cylinder to a predetermined 
pressure, such as 140 bar (2000 PSI), with an intert gas, 
such as nitrogen. This provides a gas spring or cushion 
permitting the rod to yieldably move toward its retracted 
position when a force, applied external to the rod, exceeds 
the opposing force produced by the gas in the chamber acting 
on the head. 
To charge the chamber with gas for a gas spring 
in a system piped to a remote control panel, a gas supply 
line is connected to the cylinder through a hose with a 
nipple or fitting threadably received in a valve cavity in 
the cylinder which contains the filler valve and 
communicates with a passage leading to the cylinder chamber. 
Pressurized gas is introduced into the chamber through the 
filler valve until the pressure of the gas within the 
chamber typically reaches the line pressure. The filler 
valve has a poppet valve body with the core valve which 
permits only one-way of gas during filling of the chamber. 
The poppet valve body is movable within the cavity between a 
first sealed position to prevent removal of gas from the 
chamber and a second position for bleeding gas from the 
chamber to relieve pressure within the chamber. 
The poppet 
valve body has a first effective area in communication with 
the gas supply line and a generally opposed second effective 
area in communication with the passage leading to the 
cylinder chamber. To enable the gas within the chamber to be 
compressed to a substantially greater pressure than the  
 
pressure of the gas in the supply line, the first effective 
area is larger than the second effective area. The maximum 
pressure to which gas within the chamber can be compressed 
is typically dependent upon the ratio of these effective 
areas. A gas spring having a filler valve of this 
construction is disclosed in US-A-4,838,527 which shows the 
features of the preamble of claims 1 and 11. Although filler valves of this construction,have been 
disclosed to have an effective area ratio in the range of 
about 4:3 to 4:1, they have been practically limited due to 
the
