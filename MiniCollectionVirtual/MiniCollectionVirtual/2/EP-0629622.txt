<ABSTRACT>
An s-triazine derivative represented by general formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, and 
a remedy for estrogen-dependent diseases containing the derivative as the active ingredient, wherein: (1) R₁ and R₃ represent 

each lower alkyl, and R₂ and R₄ represent each lower alkyl or phenyl which may be substituted by halogen, nitro or amino; 
or (2) both of R₁ and R₂ and/or both of R₃ and R₄ are combined together to form a cyclic amino group together with the 

nitrogen atom to which they are bonded. This compound has an aromatase inhibitory effect, i.e., the effect of inhibiting 
in 
vivo
 enzymatic conversion of androgens into estrogens thus being useful for treating estrogen-dependent diseases such as endometriosis, 
polycystic ovary₁ benign mastosis, endometrial carcinoma and mastocarcinoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to s-triazine derivatives
represented by the formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts thereof and remedies for estrogen-dependent diseases
containing the derivatives as effective components:

   wherein
(1) when R1 and R2 are respectively independent and/or R3 and R4
are respectively independent,
R1 and R3represent lower alkyl,R2 and R4represent lower alkyl, or phenyl which may be
substituted with halogen atom, nitro or amino
except for the case where all of R1, R2, R3 and R4 are methyl
and(2) when R1 and R2 and/or R3 and R4 are respectively coupled with
neighboring nitrogen atom to form cyclic amino group,
NR1R2represents 1-pyrrolidinyl; piperidino which may be 
substituted with phenyl; 1-piperazinyl which may be
substituted with lower alkyl or phenyl; morpholino; or
thiomorpholino,NR3R4represents 1-aziridinyl which may be substituted with
lower alkyl; 1-pyrrolidinyl which may be substituted with
lower alkoxycarbonyl; piperidino which may be mono- or di-substituted
with hydroxy, hydroxy lower alkyl, lower
alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkyl, cyano, phenyl or
ethylenedioxy; 1-piperazinyl which may be substituted with
lower alkyl, benzyl, phenyl which in turn may be
substituted with halogen atom, nitro or amino, pyridyl or
pyrimidinyl; morpholino which may be mono- or di-substituted
with lower alkyl; 3-thiazolidinyl;
thiomorpholino; 1-imidazolyl which may be mono- or di-substituted
with lower alkyl; or 1,2,4-triazole-1-yl.s-Triazine (1,3,5-triazine) derivatives have been researched in
the fields of synthetic resins, synthetic fibers and agricultural
chemicals and a number of such compounds have been synthesized. In the
field of pharmaceuticals, researches have been made with respect to
antitumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antispasmodic activities.
Especially, hexamethylmelamine (HMM) is well-known, which has been
developed as analogue of antitumor agent triethylenemelamine (TEM) [B.
L. Johnson et al. Cancer, 42: 2157-2161 (1978)].TEM is known as an alkylating agent and is an s-triazine
derivative having cytotoxic antitumor activity. HMM has been marketed
in Europe under the indications for the treatment of ovarian and small 
cell lung cancers, and its action on solid cancers has been attractive.As to its antitumor spectrum and antitumor activity against solid
cancers, however, there has been still room for improvement.JP-A-56-55302 discloses fungicidal compounds of formula I wherein
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are lower alkyl. Further properties of this
