<ABSTRACT>
In general, the invention relates to an improved 
assembly for insertion of an intravenous catheter and method 

of insertion which minimizes or eliminates the potential for 
exposure to blood and other bodily fluids during the use and 

insertion of an intravenous catheter. An intravenous catheter 
hub has a side opening directly to connected to a port of a 

multi-port stopcock. A modified syringe and hollow-bore 
needle are attached directly to the base of the catheter and 

when properly inserted, the needle extends slightly beyond the 
tip of the catheter. After the needle is inserted beneath a 

patient's skin, the syringe is used to generate slight 
negative pressure so that blood immediately flows into the 

syringe as soon as a vein is punctured by the needle.
 

The syringe is then removed and the flow of fluids into the 
patient may be regulated by the multi-port stopcock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an intravenous catheter assembly
according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1.In recent years the medical community has greatly
increased emphasis on new and modified procedures which
minimize or eliminate the potential risk of exposing health
care workers to blood and other bodily fluids during medical
procedures. This increased emphasis on safety is primarily
the result of the AIDS epidemic. The AIDS epidemic has
focused the attention of the medical community on virtually
any potential risk for exposure to blood or other bodily
fluids due to the potentially devastating consequences of such 
exposure. Many of the advances arising out of these concerns
have solved problems relating to the risk of puncture wounds
from exposed needles which are used for injecting medications
and inserting catheters.Although there have been many improvements in this
area, none have presented a practical solution to the problems
associated with the use and initial insertion of intravenous
catheters. This is true despite the fact that the insertion
of intravenous catheters is one of the most commonly performed
procedures in hospitals today and the manner in which it is
performed is far from safe. The greatest danger posed by this
procedure is the risk of contracting HIV from exposure to
blood. There are other additional risks associated with
exposure to blood and other bodily fluids during the insertion
of intravenous catheters such as the risk of contracting viral
hepatitis. These risks could also be reduced or eliminated
through the use of an improved catheter assembly and modified
procedure for inserting intravenous catheters.Intravenous catheters are well known in the art and
are widely used to deliver intravenous fluids and medications
to patients every day. There are new catheters for long term
central intravenous access and a myriad of attachments to
augment the utility of a given intravenous site. However, the
basic intravenous catheter and the method of insertion have
remained unchanged for decades. Conventional basic intravenous access involves the
use of a flexible radiopaque catheter which is inserted in
conjunction with a hollow bore needle. The catheter is
generally constructed of a thin wall tube of flexible
material, which is typically polytetrafluorothene (sold under
the trademark TEFLON) or polyethylene. This material is
connected to a connection bracket or base. The hollow bore
needle is of a slightly smaller gauge and slightly longer than
the catheter so that it may be

<CLAIMS>
An intravenous catheter assembly (10), comprising:

a hollow base (18) having a first end and a second end;
a catheter (14) being connected to an opening at the first
end and having a catheter base (62);
a syringe (44) which mates with an opening at the second
end , comprising:


a hollow body (50),
a hollow bore needle (46) which extends through the
hollow base (18) and the catheter,
a plunger (54) located within the hollow body (50), and
a plunger arm (56) connected to the plunger (54); and
a multi-position valve including a stopcock (16),
a plurality of ports (22,24,26) in communication with a well (38),

and a rotatable valve control (34);

characterized in that;
the valve is directly connected to a side opening in the
hollow base (18) thus being located outside a passage defined by the

hollow base between the openings at its first and second ends for
inserting the needle (46);

the base (62) of the catheter (14) is formed within the hollow base (18)
and is in communication with the well (38) of the valve;

the valve control (34) is rotatable to
selectively control which of the ports or combination of the

ports are in communication with the hollow base (18) and ultimately
the catheter (14); and
the hollow body (50) of the syringe includes a threaded
portion (52) and a non-threaded portion (53), the threaded

portion is used for advancing and retracting the plunger
incrementally.
The intravenous catheter assembly of claim 1 further
comprising a self-sealing latex member (70) which seals the

opening at the second end of the hollow base (18).
The intravenous catheter assembly of claim 1 further
comprising a sealing cap engageable with said hollow base (18) for

sealing the opening at its second end. 
The intravenous catheter assembly of claim 1 wherein the
multi-position valve is directly connected to the side opening

of the hollow base (18) through a threaded fitting on said side
opening.
The intravenous catheter assembly of claim 1 wherein the
hollow base (18) is located within a wing-shaped supporting brace.
