<ABSTRACT>
Hinge pin (articulation axle) for a vehicle caterpillar track with articulated connectors including a pin proper and blocks (30, 36) of rubber or analogous elastomeric material which are compressed after the pin (11, 12) has been fitted in the link(s) (10) of the caterpillar track. The blocks (30, 36) of rubber or analogous elastomeric material extend over the entire length of the pin and are located in two coaxial sets with the interposition of a metal tube (35) between them, the blocks (30) of the first set being secured to the external surface (32) of the pin (11, 12) while the blocks (36) of the second set are secured to the external surface (38) of the intermediate tube (35).
