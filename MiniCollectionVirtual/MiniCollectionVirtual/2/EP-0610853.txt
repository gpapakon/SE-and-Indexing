<ABSTRACT>
Atomizer comprising a liquid inlet (14), a gas inlet (12) 
arranged to receive a pressurized flow of gas, a liquid flowpath 

extending from the liquid inlet (14) to a liquid stream outlet, and a 
curved gas flowpath extending from the gas inlet to a location 

adjacent the liquid stream outlet and including a supersonic flow 
region adjacent the liquid stream outlet, whereby supersonic gas 

flow adjacent the liquid stream outlet produces a shock wave 
which impinges on a liquid stream passing out through the liquid 

stream outlet for atomizing the liquid stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an atomizer according to
the preamble of claim 1 and to a method for atomizing according
to the preamble of claim 6.There are known in the art a great variety of atomizers.
The following documents are considered to be representative
of the most relevant prior art: US-A-3 908 903; US-A-3
980 233; US-A-4 241 877; US-A-4 335 677; US-A-4 341 530; US-A-4
406 404; US-A-4 595 143; US-A-4 773 596; US-A-4 834 343; US-A-4
943 704; US-A-4 946 101; US-A-5 044 559; US-A-5 059 357;
US-A-5 181 661 and GB-A-894 776.US-A-4 341 530 describes a slurry atomizer wherein a
pressurized helical flow of steam proceeds about a longitudinal
axis, along which a liquid channel is defined. Impingement
of the helical flow of stream on the liquid channel draws liquid
through the channel and causes breakup of the resulting
axial liquid flow into droplets.US-A-4 241 877, on which the preambles of claims 1
and 6 are based, describes an atomizer comprising a liquid inlet;
a gas inlet arranged to receive a pressurized flow of
gas; a liquid flowpath extending from the liquid inlet to a
liquid stream outlet; a gas flowpath extending from the gas
inlet to an atomizer outlet and including a supersonic gas
flow region; whereby supersonic gas flow produces a shock wave
for atomizing the liquid stream in an atomizing flowpath region. Furthermore, US-A-4 241 877 discloses a method for
atomizing comprising the steps of providing a pressurized flow
of gas to a gas inlet and through a gas flowpath; providing a
liquid flowpath extending from a liquid inlet to a liquid
stream outlet; and causing the pressurized flow of gas to undergo
supersonic flow at a supersonic gas flow region thereby
to produce a shock wave for atomizing the liquid stream in an
atomizing flowpath region.Finally, GB-A-894 776 describes an apparatus for
producing a liquid spray by the interaction of a gas with the
liquid. The gas enters the apparatus at a transverse direction
to the liquid flow and flows along a helical pathway which
produces a swirl in the gas flow. The swirling gas flow interacts
with the liquid stream and breaks up the liquid into a
spray. The gas, flowing at supersonic speeds, and liquid spray
exit the apparatus at an outlet nozzle of the apparatus. The present invention seeks to provide an improved
atomizer and an improved method for atomizing.These objects are achieved by the features defined
in claims 1 and 6, respectively.Preferably, the generally helical flowpath extends
about the liquid flowpath, which preferably is axial.In
