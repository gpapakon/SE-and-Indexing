<ABSTRACT>
Closure flap for a sliding wall with locking device which locks the lower wall component in the region of the longitudinal carrier in an aerodynamically favourable way, securely locks the wall and closure flap and relieves the roller of the actuation device of the wall of stress in the closed position with a flap 1 which is attached between the lower edge of the wall 9 and the lower chord of the longitudinal carrier 12 in a rotatable fashion and on which a horizontally pivotable bolt 8 locks the flap 1 to the wall 9 and a vertically rotatable latch 11 locks the roller foot 10 to the upper chord of the longitudinal carrier 12, the cam 15 of the bolt 8 moving the lower lever of the latch 11 and the bolt 8 being moved in its horizontal plane by a pulling rod 4 which is connected to a spindle drive 16. In the closed state, the wall 9 lies with its web 18 on the bolt 8 and the bolt 8 in turn rests on the flap foot 17 which is attached in an upright position to the flap 1 and rests on the lower chord of the longitudinal carrier 12 so that the roller attached to the roller foot 10 is relieved of stress. The invention is to be applied in particular in sliding-wall-type freight wagons which are used for high-speed operations.

Sliding-panel closure flap having a locking 
device, in particular for high-speed goods wagons, in 

which sliding-panel closure flap the roller foot (10) is 
moved out of the free space of the longitudinal member 

via extension devices, in which arrangement a continuous 
hollow shaft (2) virtually rests on the bottom chord of 

the longitudinal member (12), and a flap (1) made as an 
extruded section is fastened to the hollow shaft (2) in 

a hinged manner, characterized in that the flap, in the 
closed state, fills the bottom free space between bottom 

edge of the panel (9) and bottom chord of the 
longitudinal member (12) and is adapted to the outer 

contour of the panel (9), in that a tie rod (4) of the 
locking device is provided in a hollow space located in 

the upper part of the flap (1), which tie rod (4), via 
pins (13), connects a horizontally pivotable latch (8) 

having a dog (15) to a catch (11) rotatable in the 
vertical, and in that the dog (15), in the closed 

position of the panel (9), engages behind a lower web 
(18) of the panel (9) and the catch (11) engages behind 

the drawn-in top chord of the longitudinal member (12), 
and the latch (8) fills the gap between web (18) and flap 

foot (17), the tie rod (4), at the front end of the 
wagon, engaging via a control sleeve (3) in an actuating 

fork (5) attached to the spindle (6) of a spindle drive 
(16).
