<ABSTRACT>
In order to generate a two-dimensional image of 
an object, three-dimensional model data (110) is used. 

Drawing rules are stored (400) which correspond to 
features of the object. Each drawing rule corresponds 

to a two-dimensional representation of the 
corresponding feature when that feature is viewed from 

a particular viewing direction. The drawing rule 
corresponds, in each case, to a predetermined visual 

presentation of the feature from the corresponding 
viewing direction. The user then selects (120) the 

viewing direction and the two-dimensional image is 
generated (320) using the model data and the 

appropriate drawing rule or rules. In this way, a 
feature of the object may be shown in the two-dimensional 

image with a visual appearance which is 
appropriate even if that visual appearance does not 

result from the model data. The feature may then be 
shown in a way which corresponds to the purpose to 

which the two-dimensional image is to be put.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
generating an image of an object. It is particularly 
concerned with generating a two-dimensional image of 
the object from model data representing a three-dimensional 
image of the object. The present 
invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying 
out such a method. It is well-known in computer-aided design (CAD), 
computer-aided management (CAM) or computer-aided 
engineering (CAE) to generate an image on a computer 
screen which is a three-dimensional image of an 
object. That image is generated from model data, and 
it is conventional for the model data to represent a 
plurality of features of the object, so that the image 
of the object is built-up by combining the necessary 
features. In general, such features are referred to as 
"form features" which is a term in the art used to  
 
identify a standard component of a three-dimensional 
model, such as a block, hole, etc. The term "form 
feature" is well-known, and is used, for example, in 
the article entitled "Assessment of Features 
Technology" by J J Shah in Computer Aided Design, Vol 
23, No. 5, June 1991, the article entitled "Functional 
Requirements and Conceptual Design of the Feature - 
Based Modeling System" by J J Shah and Mary T Toger in 
Computer Aided Engineering Journal, February 1988, and 
the article entitled "Designing with Features: The 
Origin of Features" by J J Cunningham and J R Dixon in 
Proc. ASME Computers in Engineering Conference 
(July/August 1988). However, in addition to form 
features, other features of the image may also be 
stored as model data, such as data representing the 
surface finishing of the object. The term "feature" 
in this specification is therefore used to include all 
these components of the image. In order to generate a hard copy of the object, 
it is necessary to transform the three-dimensional 
image into a two-dimensional image. Therefore, it is 
known to provide an arrangement in which the user of 
a CAD, CAM, or CAE system can select one viewing 
direction, and then the system generates a two-dimensional 
image of the object when viewed in that 
direction. That two-dimensional image is derived 
directly from the three-dimensional image, using the  
 
model data, and therefore will contain exactly the 
same formation is presented in the three-dimensional 
image. Thus, for example, the three-dimensional CAD 
system shown in, for example the "HICAD/DESIGN/W 
Function Addition 205 G-3 625 of HITACHI 2050G Series 
Manual" is a system in which an
