<ABSTRACT>
In a demodulator for radio data signals, the transmission of which is carried out by phase shift keying of a suppressed auxiliary carrier, a multiplex signal containing the auxiliary carrier-frequency signal being conducted via a band pass filter and an amplitude limiter, the amplitude-limited carrier-frequency signal is converted, if necessary with further filtering, into digital samples which can be supplied to at least one phase locked loop for deriving a bit clock signal.

decremented in dependence on the presence of a sign

change, that the counter is provided with an overflow
block at both ends, and that the magnitudes of the

increments and decrements are dependent on the count, a
