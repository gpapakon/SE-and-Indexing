<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OF DODECANE TEREPHTHALAMIDE POLYMERSBACKGROUND OP THE INVENTIONField of the inventionThe present invention relates to a process of preparing polya ides having a high melting temperature; more particularly, the present invention relates to a process of preparing dodecane terephthalamide polymers.Description of the prior artConventional aliphatic polyamides, commonly known as nylons, are semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymers that are noted for their useful properties such as chemical resistance, hardness, high tensile strength, toughness, rigidity and relatively high heat stability. However, conventional polyamides are hygroscopic, that is, they have a tendency to absorb moisture from their environment.The polyamides derived from terephthalic acid and alkanediamines, which are commonly referred in the art as polyterephthalamides, have been known in the art to exhibit a high melting point and low moisture sensitivity. However, the high melting point of polyterephthalamides, which is higher than 300°C and practically coincides with the thermal decomposition temperature of the polymers, renders the production of the polymers by the conventional melt polymerization process, which is the most widely used polyamide production process, impracticable. Various publications recognize this polymerization difficulty. For example, U.S.P. 2,752,328 to Magat discloses a polyterephthalamide composition with a relatively low polymerization temperature, utilizing diaminoalkanes of 6 to 8 carbon atoms with one or two methyl side chains in place of the 

 traditional straight chain diaminoalkanes. U.S.P. 3,382,216 to Blaschke et al. discloses a melt- processible, non-crystalline copolyamide of hexa ethylene diamine and a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, having a softening point and melting point far below those of polyhexamethylene terephthalamide. U.S.P. 3,696,074 to Tsuda et al. discloses terephthalamide copolymer compositions of- dodecamethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, terephthalic acid and adipic acid, which copolyamides are crystalline and have a range of melting points between 200°C and 280 °C.The difficulty in producing polyterephthalamides is further illustrated by U.S.P. 3,839,296 to Campbell and U.S.P. 3,917,561 to Chapman et al. Campbell discloses an elaborate melt polymerization procedure for producing dodecane terephthalamide copolymers, which utilizes a carefully monitored sequential polymerization process. Chapman discloses a process for producing dodecane
