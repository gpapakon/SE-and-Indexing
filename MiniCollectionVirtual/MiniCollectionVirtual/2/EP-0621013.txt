<ABSTRACT>
The object of this invention is an element designed to 
achieve the managed regeneration of tissue in dental 

therapy, and particularly lesions caused by periodontal 
diseases. This element consists of a membrane in latex or 

elastomer material that is inserted between the surgical 
flap on one side and the bone and radicular surface on the 

other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an element designed to promote the 
regeneration of the connective tissue, the bone and the 
connective attachment of a diseased dental root by means of 
a membrane/barrier inserted between the flap and the 
tooth/bone. It is known that in "pyorrhoea" there is a predominantly 
inflammatory process of the tissue of the parodontium, 
namely the gingiva, the periodontal ligament, the alveolar 
bone and the cement, the main symptom of which is the 
apical migration of the attachment with the formation of a 
pocket determined by detachment of the gums and bone 
destruction. These phlogistic signs are accompanied by processes of 
tissue degeneration and destruction with re-absorption of 
the alveolar walls and degeneration of the surrounding 
tissue. This pathological process leads to the loss of the 
teeth. The systems for treating this disease vary according to the 
stage of the disease itself. At the present time, the most widely used, advanced stage 
method is a surgical one which entails the introduction of  
 
membranes between the surgical flap on one side and the 
bone and radical surface on the other side, so as to 
promote the managed regeneration of the diseased tissue. The purpose of this invention is to obtain regeneration of 
these tissues allowing particular cell lines to be 
selective chosen from the periodontal ligament and isolated 
in a manner that allow selective colonization of the root 
surface. This can be obtained by stopping the apical 
migration of the epithelium along the radicular surface and 
to stabilise the congealment formed in the earliest phase 
of healing of the wound. This is important because it 
protects the neoformed collagen fibres from possible 
breakage and at the same time forms a covering to promote 
the growth of the cells of the periodontal ligament and the 
growth of blood vessels from the base of the lesion. Whether they are resorbable or otherwise, the membranes 
used have disadvantages which depend mainly on the type of 
material from which they are made. For example: non-resorbable 
membranes allow a greater degree of bone 
regeneration but they cause inflammation of the surrounding 
connective tissue and a second surgical operation is 
required to remove them. By contrast, resorbable membranes, for which only one 
surgical operation is required, have a lower degree of 
regeneration than the other type.  In addition, both types of membrane are still relatively 
expensive and do not succeed in hermetically excluding the 
dental element

<CLAIMS>
ELEMENT DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE TISSUE REGENERATION IN 
PERIODONTAL DENTAL THERAPY, characterised by the fact that 

it consists of a membrane made from latex or another 
natural or synthetic elastomer material provided with one 

or more holes with a smaller diameter than that of the 
tooth or teeth to be treated. 
ELEMENT, as described in claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that the said membrane is pre-formed according to pre-established 

shapes depending on the surgeon's needs and is 
such as to cover both sides of the tooth at the same time 

or also single buccal or lingual lesions.
