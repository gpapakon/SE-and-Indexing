Valve station for use in connection with the control of 
fluid-actuable devices, for example working cylinders, having a 

fluid distributor (2) with internal fluid passages (5) and 
equipped with electrically-actuable pneumatic valves (4) which 

communicate with the fluid passages, and having a signal 
distributor (18) from which the pneumatic valves obtain their 

electrical actuation signals, characterized in that the valve 
station is designed for combined actuation of both pneumatic 

valves (4) and hydraulic valves (28), and has one or more control 
ports (27) for connection with one or more electrically-actuable 

valve drives (32) of a hydraulic valve (28). 
Valve station according to claim 1, characterized in that one 
or more control ports (27) is designed as a connection for one 

or more continuing signal conductors (33), through which an 
external hydraulic valve (28) may be connected. 
Valve station according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
control port (27) is an electrical plug-in connection. 
Valve station according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that one or more control ports (27) is provided at an actuation 

element (25) of the valve station (1). 
Valve station according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
actuation element (25) is in the form of a component which is 

separate from but permanently connected to the signal distributor 
(18).  

 
Valve station according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that several actuation elements (25) are provided, arranged 

consecutively in one direction of mounting (40) and releasably 
connected to one another. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that one or more actuation elements (25) are 

provided, equipped with outputs and/or inputs (37) for control 
signals, leading in particular to monitoring devices. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that one or more control ports (37) for 

hydraulic valves (28) is connected to an electrical and/or 
electronic outlet stage matched to the valve drive (32) of the 

hydraulic valve (28) to be connected, and expediently 
accommodated in any actuation valve (25) which may be provided. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the fluid distributor (2) is suitable for 

simultaneous equipping with one or more pneumatic valves (4) and 
one or more hydraulic valves (28). 
Valve station according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the fluid distributor (2) for pneumatic valves (4) and hydraulic 

valves (28) contains two systems of passages separate from one 
another. 
Valve station according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in 
that the fluid distributor (2) is comprised of several 

distributor modules (39, 39'), each designed for equipping with 
one of the two respective valve types and containing a suitable 

adapted system of passages.
