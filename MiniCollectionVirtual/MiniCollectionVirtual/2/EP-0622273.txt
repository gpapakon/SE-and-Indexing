<ABSTRACT>
A roof rail for vehicles which is composed of two beams (2) and supporting feet (3) supporting the latter is described. Each beam (2) takes the form of a hollow profile section having a longitudinal channel (4) which is open at the top and has undercuts (5). On each beam (2) there are optionally arranged a covering profile strip (12) which can be releasably anchored in the longitudinal channel (4) and extends beyond the length of the beams or a covering profile strip (12) which extends beyond a first longitudinal section of the beam (2) and a supporting profile strip (14) which extends beyond the second longitudinal section. The supporting profile strips (14) are arranged in such a way that they can be pivoted into an in-use position which connects the beams (2) to one another in a transverse fashion.
