<ABSTRACT>
A method for maintaining catalytic activity during 
a hydrosilylation reaction between a silicon hydride and an 

unsaturated compound is disclosed. The method comprises 
reacting a silicon hydride and an unsaturated compound in 

the presence of a platinum catalyst wherein a peroxide is 
added into the reaction mixture to maintain the catalytic 

activity of the platinum catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
One method in the art for producing organosilicon
compounds comprises reacting a silicon hydride compound with
an unsaturated compound in the presence of a catalyst. This
reaction is commonly referred to as hydrosilylation.
Typically, the catalyst is platinum metal on a support, a
platinum compound generally used in an inert solvent, or a
platinum complex. However, other catalysts comprising
rhodium or nickel may be used.The prior art of these catalysts is represented by
US-A 2,823,218; US-A 3,220,972 and EP-A 0 337 197.One of the major problems with hydrosilylation is
the deactivation of the catalyst prior to completion of the
reaction. One accepted method for catalyst reactivation has
been to expose the reaction mixture to oxygen. For example,
US-A 4,578,497 teaches the use of an oxygenated, platinum-containing
catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions.The use of peroxides to activate reactions that
are otherwise unreactive using metallic catalysts is known
for several reactants and catalysts. In these situations
there is no catalytic activity in the absence of the
peroxide. Thus, the peroxide is introduced to "start" or
activate the reaction rather than to maintain catalytic
activity. This prior art is represented by the following
journal articles: Licchelli et al., "Catalyzed
Hydrosilylation of 2-Methyl-1-buten-3-yne with
Methyldichlorosilane; Promotional Effect Imparted by the
Presence of a Different Chlorosilane", Tetrahedron Letters,
Vol.28, No. 2, pp.3719-3722 (1987); Dickers et al.,
"Organosilicon Chemistry, Part 24, Homogeneous Rhodium-catalyzed
Hydrosilation of Alkenes and Alkynes: Role of 
Oxygen or Hydroperoxides", J.C.S. Dalton, pp. 308-313
(1980); and Calhoun et al., "Organic Peroxide Assisted
Transition Metal Hydrosilylation Catalysis", Transition Met.
Chem., 8, 365-368(1983).An object of this invention is to provide a method
for maintaining catalytic activity during a hydrosilylation
reaction wherein the hydrosilylation reaction comprises
reacting a silicon hydride having 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms
attached to the silicon with unsaturated compounds in the
presence of a platinum catalyst and a peroxide.Our invention introduces a method of maintaining
catalytic activity in a hydrosilylation reaction wherein the
reaction comprises reacting silicon hydrides having 1 to 3
hydrogen atoms attached to the silicon with unsaturated
compounds to produce organosilicon compounds. The reaction
is catalyzed using a platinum catalyst selected from
platinum metal, platinum compounds and platinum complexes.
