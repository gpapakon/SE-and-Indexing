<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal transfer 
sheets for thermal transfer printers used as a hard copy 
output device in personal computers, word processors and 
the like, and more particularly to thermal transfer 
sheets which can provide prints having excellent 
rubbing/scratch resistance and solvent resistance when 
printing is carried out on various plastics under high 
printing energy conditions. A hot-melt thermal transfer sheet formed by coating 
an ink comprising a mixture of wax with a pigment on one 
side (surface) of a substrate film by means of a coater 
to form a hot-melt ink layer has hitherto been widely 
used as a thermal transfer sheet at the time of printing 
of hard copies for personal computers, word processors 
and the like by the thermal transfer system. In the thermal transfer sheet having a thermal 
transfer ink layer composed mainly of wax, the thermal 
transfer sheet is imagewise heated by means of a thermal 
head from the back surface thereof to melt the thermal 
transfer ink in the thermal transfer ink layer. At that 
time, an image is formed on a material, on which an image 
is to be transferred, by taking advantage of the adhesive 
property of the ink layer developed by the heating. For 
this reason, the ink layer and the release layer each 
comprise a low-melting material. Due to the use of the low-melting material, prints 
formed by such a thermal transfer sheet have poor rubbing 
and scratch resistance. Further, the resistance of the 
prints to various general-purpose solvents is also poor. 
Therefore, it is difficult to use the above thermal 
transfer sheet in applications where the scratch 
resistance and the solvent resistance are required,  
 
particularly in printing on plastic labels, plastic 
cards, plastic bags and the like. On the other hand, printing under high printing 
energy conditions (high temperatures) has been proposed 
in order to enhance the fixability of the ink onto the 
surface of plastic materials. This method, however, can 
cause unfavorable phenomena, such as fusing of the 
release layer and further the substrate film onto prints 
due to the high temperature, tearing of the substrate 
film or occurrence of dropout, which is detrimental to 
the film formability of the surface of the print, thus 
resulting in a deterioration of the rubbing/scratch 
resistance and the solvent resistance of the prints. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 42891/1988 discloses 
a thermal printing medium comprising a substrate sheet, a 
transparent or semi-transparent
