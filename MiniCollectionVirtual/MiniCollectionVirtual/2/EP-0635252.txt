<ABSTRACT>
A hydromassage system envisages a washing and/or disinfecting process, 
comprising the stages of filling only a small part of the bath with water 

containing an appropriate additive and causing it to circulate by means 
of a pump inside the entire hydraulic system, the water emitted from the 

delivery nozzles striking the internal walls of the bath, giving rise to 
efficient washing and disinfecting of the said bath; a plant for 

implementing the process is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydromassage system and more
precisely to an improved process and associated improved plant for
washing and disinfecting the system.It is known that hydromassage consists in striking the user's body
immersed inside a bath with a jet of pressurised water mixed with air,
delivered by one or more nozzles mounted in the walls of the bath.Various types of delivery nozzles for hydromassage are known,
operation of which consists generally in passing a certain quantity of
water through a section having the shape of a Venturi tube, causing in
this way a negative pressure which in turn causes the suction of air
which is mixed with water expelled from the nozzle in the form of a jet.Various technical requirements are associated with a hydromassage
system, including in particular that of washing and/or disinfecting the
system itself before (or after, depending on the circumstances) it has
been used.In particular this requirement is of greater importance for
hydromassage systems installed in communal premises (hotels, rest homes,
gyms, etc.) where the users, doubting the effectiveness of the cleaning
operations performed by the service personnel, prefer themselves to
activate, as and when required, an automatic device for washing and
disinfecting the hydromassage system.Various washing and disinfecting devices exist in the sector: a
first example involves the pumping of disinfectant into the water pipes
with the delivery nozzles closed.Although in general this device performs its function, it is not
without drawbacks: in fact the delivery nozzles are not exposed to the
action of the circulating disinfectant, the interior of the bath is not
involved in any way and the user is unable to check what is happening
during the cycle.A second example involves the introduction of disinfectant into the
bath full of water and then the circulation of the treated water inside
the hydraulic piping such that it flows back into the bath through the 
delivery nozzles.This device is also not without drawbacks: in fact, a large
quantity of water is required, since the use of the hydromassage water to
carry out disinfecting is not acceptable.Furthermore, a large quantity of additives is used with
consequences both in terms of the costs and from an ecological point of
view.Also, during emptying, any residue present in the water is
deposited along the walls of the bath.In this connection EP-A-0 164 068 can be cited as a prior construction where the suction of additive-containing
water by a pump - which

<CLAIMS>
A time-controlled process for cleaning and/or disinfecting a hydromassage system
including a bath (26) provided with one or more delivery nozzles (28) arranged at a

certain height (H) from the bottom of the bath (26) and a hydraulic circuit having at least one pumping
means (24, 32) and a delivery pipe (27) connected to the said nozzles (28), which

comprises the steps of:

(a) introducing into said bath (26), through a supply pipe (17) branched off from the
water mains and a nozzle (29) arranged at the bottom of the bath, a predetermined

quantity of water containing at least one additive which corresponds to a level (h)
situated between the bottom of the bath (26) and the said height (H) of the delivery

nozzles (28);
(b) activating said pump (24, 32) so as to suck the additive-containing
water from the bath (26) through the nozzle (29) arranged at the bottom of the bath

(26) and to convey it to each of the said delivery nozzles (28) along said delivery pipe
(27);
(c) emitting the additive-containing water from the delivery nozzles (28) so as to let it
flow down the walls of the bath (28);
(d) recycling the additive-containing water by the said pump (24, 32) from
said nozzle (29) arranged at the bottom of the bath (26) through said hydraulic circuit

so as to impinge the internal walls of the bath (26);
(e) discharging the additive-containing water out of the bath (26).

 each additive is chosen from among a
cleaning substance, a disinfecting substance and a scenting substance.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each additive is added to the water
separately from the other additives.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 various additives are added
simultaneously to the water.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a step in which the water is
sterilized by means of ultraviolet rays during the said recycling step.
