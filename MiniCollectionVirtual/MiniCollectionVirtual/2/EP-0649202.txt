<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser having a plurality of 
semiconductor laser chips laminated one above another by solder 

layers which 
cause no interference with laser beams is provided. To this 

end, each of the semiconductor laser chips has a solder sump 
recess formed in the surface to be soldered at an end 

adjacent to a laser beam radiating surface and extending 
through portions of the chip except an active layer. This 

semiconductor laser is manufactured by a method comprising 
the steps of forming grooves in a surface of an epitaxial 

substrate along boundaries of semiconductor laser chip areas 
for defining laser beam radiating surfaces, each of the 

grooves extending through portions constituting the 
substrate except an active layer and having a bottom 

substantially parallel to the epitaxial substrate surface; 
cleaving the epitaxial substrate along the grooves to 

provide the semiconductor laser chips with laser beam 
radiating surfaces defined by the cleaved surfaces; and 

laminating the plurality of semiconductor laser chips one 
above another by soldering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
and a method of manufacturing the same, and more 
particularly to a semiconductor laser and a method of 
manufacturing the same wherein solder layers used for 
stacking a plurality of semiconductor laser chips cause no 
interference with laser beam radiation. Conventionally, a semiconductor laser has been composed 
of a semiconductor laser chip stack having semiconductor 
laser chips laminated one above another by soldering. Such 
a prior art semiconductor laser is disclosed, for example, 
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 4-48664 and 4-78179. 
Such a semiconductor laser chip stack is suitable 
for providing high output. FIG. 7 shows a sectional structure of such a prior art 
semiconductor laser. In FIG. 7, a semiconductor laser chip 
stack 70 is composed of semiconductor laser chips 71, 72 and 
73 laminated one above another and joined to one another by 
respective solder layers 74 and 75. The semiconductor laser chip 71 includes an active 
layer 71a which is formed at an end thereof with a laser  
 
beam radiating surface 71b. Similarly, the semiconductor 
laser chip 72 includes an active layer 72a which is formed 
at an end thereof with a laser beam radiating surface 72b, 
and the semiconductor laser chip 73 includes an active layer 
73a which is formed at an end thereof with a laser beam 
radiating surface 73b. The laser beam radiating surfaces 71b, 72b and 73b are 
arranged in a common plane. A laser beam 71c is emitted 
from the laser beam radiating surface 71b, a laser beam 72c 
from the laser beam radiating surface 72b, and a laser beam 
73c from the laser beam radiating surface 73b. In the above prior art, however, due to load applied 
when the semiconductor laser chip stack 70 is formed in 
layers, a solder flash 74a is formed at the end of the 
solder layer 74 and a solder flash 75a is formed at the end of the 
solder layer 75. If formation of such flashes is to be 
avoided, the connecting strength will become 
disadvantageously insufficient, resulting in separation of 
chips and increase of connecting resistance. Thus, the solder flash 74a interferes with the laser 
beam 71c, and the solder flash 75a interferes with the laser 
beam 72c, so that the laser beams 71c and 72c are restricted 
as shown in FIG. 7. Consequently, the prior art involves a 
defect that luminous efficiency of radiation of the 
semiconductor laser chip stack 70 is substantially reduced.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
semiconduct
