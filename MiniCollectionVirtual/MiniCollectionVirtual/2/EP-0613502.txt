<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally, to methods and reagents for identifying and
detecting bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).In order to treat successfully a disease caused by a bacterium, the rapid and accurate
detection and identification of the disease-causing bacterium is required. The detection and
identification have traditionally been accomplished by pure culture isolation and
identification procedures that make use of knowledge of specimen source, growth
requirements, visible (colony) growth features, microscopic morphology, staining
reactions, and biochemical characteristics.A number of different bacterial species can cause meningitis when present in the
CSF. The species most frequently causing meningitis include: Escherichia coli and other
enteric bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Listeria monocytogenes.Conventional methods of detection and identification of bacteria in cerebrospinal
fluid include the Gram stain, latex agglutination and other antibody-based tests, and
culture. The Gram stain and antibody-based tests are rapid (< 1 hour), but of low
sensitivity (requiring at least 104 colony forming units [CFU] bacteria per ml). Culture
methods, while sensitive to approximately 2 CFU per ml. require overnight incubationA number of scientific publications relating to this invention exist. For example
the polymerase chain reaction has been used to detect individual species of bacteria causing
meningitis: Kuritza and Oehler, May, 1991, Abstracts of the General Meeting of the ASM
page 84; Deneer and Boychuk, 1991, Applied Environmental Microbiology57:606-609.
and Kristiansen etal., 1991, Lancet337;1568-1569.European Patent Publication No. 314 294 discloses nucleic acid
fragments capable of hybridizing to the rRNA of Listeria monocytogenes and
not to rRNA of a number of other bacteria, including closely related Bacillus
subtilis. PCT Patent Publication No. 88/03957 describes a number of nucleic
acid probes for detection and/or quantitation of various non viral organisms,
and methods for preparing such probes. PCT Patent Publication No. 90/15157
relates to nucleic acid probes capable of hybridizing to rRNA of eubacteria
and not to rRNA of non-eubacteria, and methods using such probes, and
discloses in Example 18 a probe specific to some degree to E.coli. In none of
the above three patent publications, the nucleic acid to be detected is
amplified.K. H. Wilson et al., 1989, J. Clin. Microbiol. 2692-2696, discloses
