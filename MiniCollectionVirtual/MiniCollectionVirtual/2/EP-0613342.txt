<ABSTRACT>
Mesomorphic phases of edible surfactants can advantageously be incorporated in meat products to provide for example structuring, juiciness or fat-replacement. Preferably the mesomorphic phases are present as bulk phases and comprise discret areas of mesomorphic phase having a particle size between 1  mu m and 1,000  mu m. More preferably at least 5 % by volume of the product is in the form of a mesomorphic phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of mesomorphic 
phases of edible surfactants in meat products. According to the general prior art the structuring of 
foodstuffs can be accomplished in various ways. Two main 
routes can be distinguished: 
(1) the structuring by biopolymers such as proteins and 
carbohydrates, and (2) the structuring by "particles" in the widest sense. In the former case polymeric molecules cross-link to form a 
tangled, interconnected molecular network in water. In 
those systems the presence of junction zones or 
entanglements leads to gel formation and the enclosure of 
water. Examples of those polymeric substances are starch in 
puddings, gelatin in desserts and in the water phase of fat 
spreads, pectin in jams, carrageen in desserts and in the 
water phase of fat spreads, and many others. In the second case entities such as air cells, water 
droplets, fat droplets, crystals, starch granules or casein 
micelles are dispersed into the food system. Interaction 
forces between such particles determine the consistency and 
the physical stability of the food products. Many food 
systems fall into this category. In yoghurt aggregated 
protein particles form a network of protein strands. In 
mayonnaise an "interconnected" structure of oil droplets is 
responsible for its consistency. In a shortening fat 
crystals form an interconnected network structure enclosing 
oil. In a margarine water droplets are dispersed into a 
continuous network structure of fat crystals and oil. So, 
this represents a dispersion of particles in a network of 
particles. Even more complicated structures are found in  
 
butter and ice cream. But in all those cases a build-up of 
structure of particle networks can be distinguished, which 
is responsible for the consistency of the finished 
products. The present invention provides a new way of structuring 
meat products. The presence of mesomorphic phases of edible 
surfactant molecules and water can give rise to a firm 
texture and consistency and a juicy taste. The use of this 
property of mesomorphic phases, to give consistency to meat 
products, is new to the food business. For the purpose of the invention the term mesomorphic phase 
is intended to include all semi-ordered phases of water and 
structuring materials. Mesomorphic phases and their method 
of preparation are known to food scientists. The prior art, more in particular S. Friberg "Food 
emulsions", Marcel Dekker, New York 1976 page 67-139 
discloses food emulsifiers and their associations with
