<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a packaging unit for sheet like material (for instance paper) comprising a box (1) provided with a lid (2), both of rectangular configuration and comprising a centre part, two side parts and two end wall parts and being easily dismountable, wherein each box end wall part (4) has an additional end wall part (3) which is mounted externally on the first mentioned end wall part (4) and which has a generally rectangular configuration and an area which is 70-100 % of the actual or imaginary area of the inwardly lying end wall part (4), characterized in that the additional end wall part (3) is fastened at least partially to the lower region of the inwardly lying end wall part (4); and in that the additional end wall part (3) is provided in its upper half with a foldable lip (7) from which material has been removed on at least one side (5, 6), said lip (7) partly enabling the uppermost part of the additional end wall part (3) to be folded outwardly of the lid end wall part and partly subsequent to being folded functions to strengthen and protect the resultant gripping aperture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a packaging unit for all 
types of sheet like material. The packaging unit is particularly 
suited for paper, for instance paper which has been 
collected into bundles or reams. The sheet size of the 
material, preferably paper, may vary. The packaging unit is 
suited for packaging standard paper sizes, such as A4 
(210 x 297 mm) and A3 (420 x 297 mm). Other paper sizes which 
can be packaged in the packaging unit include U.S. Quarto 
(215 x 279 mm) and American Foolscap (215 x 330 mm), which 
are typical North American paper sizes. The packaging unit may be made from any know packaging 
unit material. A particularly suitable material is corrugated 
fibreboard. Paperboard or cardboard may also be used to 
advantage. Within the group corrugated fibreboard a brown 
coloured fibreboard can be used, i.e. in which all of the 
material layers are comprised of paper which has been manufactured 
from unbleached or semi-bleached pulp. From the 
aspect of appearance and possible printing it is beneficial 
to produce that side of the fibreboard which is to form the 
outer surface of the packaging unit from a bleached, preferably 
fully bleached, pulp, or from a paper which has been 
given a white colour in some other way.  
 When the packagaing unit is used for packaging paper 
or paper bundles of A4-size, the surface weight of the corrugated 
fibreboard will conveniently lie within the range of 
100-200 g/m2. Sheet like material, such as paper in bundles and for 
instance of A4-size, are normally packaged in conventional, 
rectangular boxes comprising lid which is fitted over the 
open upper side of the box. Normally, one or more bands, for 
instance plastic bands, are wrapped around the box and its 
lid. With regard to copying paper, for instance, they are 
often bundled into one ream, i.e. 500 sheets are collected 
and cased in a paper envelope. There are packaging units with 
different numbers of paper bundles or reams. Five reams is 
not an unusual number. When the paper in question, for instance 
copying paper, is to be used the outer packaging unit 
is opened first, and then the inner package. The outer 
packaging unit is opened by clipping or cutting the band or 
bands around said unit and then lifting the lid from the box, 
so as to provide easy access to the first ream. It is then 
only necessary to remove the inner packaging material, i.e. 
the wrapping paper and place the paper bundle in the copying 
machine. The aforesaid (outer) packaging unit is not free 
from problem.

<CLAIMS>
A packaging unit for sheet like material, such as paper of 
A4-size, comprising a box (1) provided with a lid (2), 

both of rectangular configuration and comprising a centre 
part, two sides and two end walls and being 

easily dismountable, wherein each box end wall (4) 
has an additional end wall part (3) which is mounted 

externally on the first mentioned end wall (4) and 
which has a generally rectangular configuration and which, 

when the inner end wall (4) consists of a part or 
parts (8, 9) fully covering the whole width of the box end, 

has an area which is 70-100% of the area of the 
inwardly lying end wall (4) or, when the inner end 

wall (4) is comprised of two parts which do not cover 
the whole width of the box end, has an 

area which is 70-100 % of the sum of the areas of the 
inwardly lying end wall parts (8, 9) 

and the area between the inwardly lying end wall parts (8, 9); and 
wherein the additional end wall 

part (3) is fastened at least partially to the lower 
region of the inwardly lying end wall (4); and in 

that the additional end wall part (3) is provided within 
its upper half with a foldable lip (7) from which material 

has been removed on at least one side (5, 6) to form at least one aperture, said lip (7) 
partly enabling the uppermost part of the additional end 

wall part (3) to be folded outwardly of the lid end wall 
part and partly subsequent to being folded functioning to 

strengthen and protect the gripping aperture produced by 
folding upwards the lip (7) and folding outwards the upper 

portion of the additional end wall part (3).  
 
A packaging unit according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that the box (1) is originally 
comprised of a continuous, foldable blank which includes the 

two additional end wall parts (3). 
A packaging unit according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that the box (1) is originally 
comprised of a conventional continuous and foldable blank; 

and in that a separate, additional end wall part (3) is 
mounted on a respective box end wall (4). 
A packaging unit according to Claims 1-3,
characterized
 in that each of the inner box end 
wall (4) is comprised of two parts of mutually equal 

size.  
 
A packaging unit according to Claims 1-4,
characterized
 in that the additional end wall 
part (3) is fastened to the lower region of the inwardly 

lying end wall (4) in a punctiform or continuous 
fashion, along at least one horizontal line on the two parts 

of the end wall or on one part thereof, for instance 
with the aid of an adhesive. 
A packaging unit according to Claims 1-4,
characterized
 in that the additional end wall 
part (3) is fastened to the lower region of the inwardly 

lying end wall (4) in a punctiform or continuous 
fashion, along at least one vertical line on the two parts of 

the end wall or on one part thereof, for instance with 
the aid of an adhesive. 
A packaging unit according to Claims 1-6,
characterized
 in that the additional end wall 
part (3) is provided with at least one groove, preferably on 

its inner surface, at least one groove being formed in the 
upper region of the additional end wall part.
