<ABSTRACT>
A video signal is processed to selectively permit copying by 
superposing in that portion of the video signal which does not 

contain useful picture information a copyright information signal 
indicative of whether the viewable picture that is displayed from the 

video signal is subject to copyright and a copy generation signal 
indicative of the number of successive generations of copies that can 

be made from the video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copy protection of a video signal.Various techniques and formats have been proposed to prevent
video signals from being copied, or dubbed, without authorization.
For example, it is preferable in many environments to permit a video
signal to be displayed as a video picture on, for example, a
television monitor, but to prevent that same video signal from being
recorded by a video recorder. The video signal may be transmitted
via cable, direct satellite broadcast (DSB) or over-the-air; or the
video signal may be recorded on a video tape or a video disk. In the
field of sales or rentals of video tapes and video disks, substantial
amounts of revenues will be lost if a user is permitted to make a
copy of the video program on a video tape or disk, thereby depriving
the originator or distributor of the video tape or video disk of
additional sales or rentals. Even though the unlawful re-recording
or dubbing of such video programs may constitute copyright
infringement, the threat of prosecution therefor presents little if
any deterrent to such unlawful copying. Consequently, more positive
approaches have been adopted to prevent a user from making an
unauthorized copy of a video program in the form of a video recording
thereof.In one anti-copying scheme the video signal is modified to
defeat the satisfactory operation of a typical video recorder yet
still permit the display of an acceptable video picture therefrom.
This is achieved by reducing the number of vertical synchronizing
pulses included in the vertical blanking interval, thereby defeating
the servo locking operation of the typical video recorder but
permitting adequate detection of the vertical synchronizing pulses in
the usual television receiver sync detector. In another proposal
high amplitude pulses are inserted into a normally blank line
interval of the vertical blanking interval so as to cause the usual
automatic gain control (AGC) circuitry in a typical video recorder to
reduce the recording level of the signal recorded thereby, resulting
in a recorded video signal whose amplitude is effectively zero.As yet another example, it has been proposed to superpose a
copy inhibit pulse on, for example, the equalizing or vertical 
synchronizing pulses normally included in the vertical blanking interval and to
include in the recording channel of a video recorder a detector which operates to
inhibit the recorder from operating in a record mode upon detecting this inhibit
pulse.WO-A-9 216 944 discloses a digital recording system for
