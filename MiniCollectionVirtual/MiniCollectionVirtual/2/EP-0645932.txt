<ABSTRACT>
A method of displaying a video image in a computer which 
has the ability to simultaneously display multiple windows. A 

graphics image is displayed in a first window, and a video 
image is displayed in a second window having controls for 

annotating the graphics image in the first window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system in which both graphics and video images are
transferred between users of remotely located computers. More, particularly, it relates to the
relationship between the graphics and video images and how these images are displayed.Collaborative computing involves the generation of data such as a graphical image by
an application running on one of the computers and the replication of that image on the
displays of the other computers. The system also involves the control of the common image
including the ability of different users to change and/or annotate the image.Another feature of this collaborative computing system is the generation of a video
image of a user of one of the computers and the transfer and display of that image at remote
locations.The present collaborative computing system involves the interrelationship of the
graphics and video images transferred between computers. IEEE INFOCOM '91 THE

<CLAIMS>
A method of displaying a video image in a computer having the ability to
simultaneously display multiple windows, the method comprising the steps of:


a) displaying a graphics image in a first window (28); and
b) displaying a video image in a second window (26,44), characterized by the steps of
c) displaying in a third window (10a) control elements for annotating said graphics image in said first window
(28); and
d) when said graphics image is displayed, automatically transferring said video image
from said second window (26,44) into said third window (10a) and closing said second

window (26,44).
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that said video image is
transferred to said computer from a remotely located computer.
A method according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that said graphics image is
transferred to said computer from a remotely located computer.
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the further step of:

   activating a control element (20) in said third window (10a) to recreate the second
window (26,44) and move said video image from said third window (10a) to said second

window (26,44).
A computer system comprising one or more computers, each having the ability to
simultaneously display multiple windows, comprising:


a) means for displaying a graphics image in a first window (28);
b) means for displaying a video image within a second window (26,44); characterized by
c) means for displaying in a third window (10a) control elements for annotating said graphics image in said first
window (28) ; and
d) means for automatically transferring said video image from the second window
(26,44) into the third window (10a) when said graphics image is displayed and for closing

said second window (26,44).
A computer system according to claim 5, characterized by two or more computers,
each of the computers having a single window in which a common application is

shared, comprising

   means for displaying multiple windows in a first of said computers, comprising:

means for displaying said shared window; means for displaying a manager window
having tools for changing the appearance of the application in the shared window; and
means for displaying a video image received from a second of said computers in said
manager window.
