<ABSTRACT>
The unit consists of a fixed structure (11), a crimping block (12) itself containing a jaw support (26), several jaws (27a,27b) and a displacement jack (13) for operating the jaws. The jack (13) is made up of a tubular body (18) and a piston (16) fixed to the piston rod (15) which in turn is fixed to the structure (11). The crimping block (12) is attached in a manner detachable on the rod (15) by a sleeve nut (20). The actuating collar (14) of the jaws (27a,27b) is fixed in a detachable way to the end of the jack body (18). A force transducer (40) is inserted between the crimping block (12) and the piston rod (15) and a displacement transducer (43) is placed on the fixed structure (11).

<CLAIMS>
Device for crimping a metallic ring (2) to a cylindrical
body (1), of adjustable diameter, comprising a fixed frame (11),

a crimping unit (12) itself comprising a jaw support (26), at
least two jaws (27a, 27b) mounted to move on the support (26),

towards each other in order to carry out the crimping and in the
opposite direction for the release of the jaws (27a, 27b), the

support (26) constituting with the jaws (27a, 27b) a removable
crimping unit and a jack (13) for moving the jaws (27a, 27b) in

order to carry out the crimping, through the intermediary of
actuating means (14) comprising an actuating surface intended to

come into engagement with a corresponding surface (37a, 37b) of
the jaws (27a, 27b) for their movement in the radial direction

of the support (26), characterized by the fact that the jack (13)
for moving the jaws (27a, 27b) comprises a movable jack body (18)

of tubular shape and a piston (16) integral with a jack rod (15)
fixed to the frame (11), the jack body (18) defining a chamber

(17) in which the piston (16) is engaged and mounted to slide on
the piston (16) and on the jack rod (15), that the support (26)

for the crimping jaws (27a, 27b) of general cylindrical shape is
fixed to the frame (11) in a detachable manner, in axial

alignment with the jack rod (15), that the means (14) for
actuating the jaws (27a, 27b) are detachably fixed to one end of

the jack body (18), for the movement of the jaws (27a, 27b) in
the radial direction of the support (26), by movement of the jack

body (18) in the axial direction and that in addition it
comprises a force sensor (40) interposed, in a space of axial

direction, between the crimping unit (12) and the jack rod (15)
and a movement sensor (43) fixed to the fixed frame (11)

comprising a feeler member (43a) cooperating with an abutment
(45) integral with the jack body (18).
Crimping device according to Claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the jack rod (15) is made in a tubular shape and that

a nut sleeve (20) of tubular shape is mounted inside the jack rod
(15) and comprises at one end, a tapped internal part (19a) for

fixing a threaded part (33) of the support (26) for the jaws
(27a, 27b), the internal bore of the nut sleeve (20) and the 

internal bore of the support (26) constructed in a tubular shape
forming an extension (1) of the other.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized by the fact that
the tubular support (26) for the jaws (27a, 27b) comprises a

groove (34) in its outer surface, for the engagement of a key
(35) for preventing rotation, engaged and fixed in the jack rod

(15).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized by
the fact that the means (14) for actuating the jaws (27a, 27b)

are of annular shape and comprise an inner surface of
substantially frustoconical shape, the jaws (27a, 27b) comprising

corresponding actuating surfaces (37a, 37b) of frustoconical
shape on their outer surface.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized by
the fact that the jaws (27a, 27b) comprise a crimping part (30a,

30b) projecting inwards, i.e. towards the axis (36) of the
support (26).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized by
the fact that the support (26) for the jaws (27a, 27b) comprises

a sleeve (32) for receiving a metal ring (2) at one of its ends
disposed between the jaws (27a, 27b).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that
the force sensor (40) is interposed between the jack rod (15) and

at least one support member (41, 42) locked by a threaded part
(44) itself in abutment against the support (26) for the jaws

(27a, 27b) ensuring the pre-stressing of the force sensor (40).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized by
the fact that means (14) for actuating the jaws (27a, 27b) are

fixed by screws to an end part (18c) of the jack body (18).
Use of a device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, for
fixing one end of a flexible conduit (1) of an automobile vehicle

engine between an inner ring (4) and an outer ring (2) which is
deformed by crimping on the flexible pipe (1).
