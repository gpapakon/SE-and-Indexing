<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adhesive compositions generally, and more
particularly to tissue adhesives useful in the practice of medicine and surgery on
human or animal subjects.Various types of tissue adhesives are known in the art. Three of these,
namely the cyanoacrylates, gelatin-formaldehyde compositions, and fibrin based
glues, have received the most attention. For example, fibrin (a blood-clotting
protein) and gelatin-formaldehyde have each been used in surgical adhesive
applications, as have cyanoacrylates. Such adhesives work to a limited degree but
have drawbacks as indicated below.Several cyanoacrylates have been investigated for surgical use. For
instance, some isobutyl cyanoacrylate formulations have been approved for
veterinary use. Typically, monomer or a mixture of oligomers and/or monomer is
applied to the site to be bonded where it rapidly polymerizes forming an adherent
solid. One disadvantage of cyanoacrylate glues is that they require a dry field.
Another is that the solid produced is non-absorbable, which limits the usefulness
of the glue in internal applications. Also, the polymerization tends to be quite
exothermic and adverse tissue response has been reported. See, for example,
Bonutti, P. et al., Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research, Vol. 229, pages
241-248 (1988); Nelson, R. et al., Arch. Surg. Vol. 100, pages 295-298 (1970);
and Celik, H., et al., "Nonsuture closure of arterial defect by vein graft using
isobutyl-2 cyanoacrylate as a tissue adhesive." Journal of Neurosurgical Sciences
Vol. 35, No. 2 (April-June 1991).Glues based on gelatins that are cross-linked with formaldehyde have been
used experimentally, principally in Europe, since about 1964. Of the several 
formulations that have been proposed, one that is referred to as "GRF" (gelatin,
resorcinol, formol) is perhaps best known. Hot solutions of gelatin are mixed in
situ with a curing agent consisting primarily of formaldehyde solution. The
mixture rapidly sets to a solid which adheres to tissues. The chief objection to
GRF glues has been the obligatory use of formaldehyde, a known hazardous
material. Also, the gelatin must be applied hot, significantly above body
temperature, and the techniques of mixing and application are quite critical for
successful use of GRF. See, for example, Fabiani, et al., Ann. Thorac. Surg.

(September 1989); Bachet, et al., J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. Vol. 83 (1982),
