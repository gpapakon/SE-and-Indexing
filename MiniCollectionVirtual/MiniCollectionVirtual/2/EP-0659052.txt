<ABSTRACT>
A sampling device for perfume comprises a perfume sample support film (1) to be stuck to a presentation sheet (3) such as paper, cardboard, at least one perfume sample (5) in the form of a gel applied to the support film (1) and a removable protective film (6) applied to this sample which, when removed from the support film (1), causes the perfume sample (5) to be removed from the support film (1) due to its adhesion to said protective film (6). This allows the perfume to be tried by application to the skin.

Sampling device for perfume, comprising a backing
foil (1) intended to adhere to a presentation sheet (3),

such as paper or cardboard, at least one perfume sample
(5) supported on the backing foil (1), and a detachable

protective foil (6) which is applied over the sample and
which, when it is detached, carries away with it the

perfume sample (5),

   characterized in that each supported perfume
sample is in the form of an unencapsulated gel devoid

of microcapsules and in that the detachable protective
foil keeps the gel of perfume sample(s) adhering to its

face in contact with the gel when removed from the
backing foil, thus separating the perfume samp
le or
samples from the latter and then enabling the perfume

or perfumes to be tried out by application to the skin.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the protective foil (6) entirely covers the sample

backing foil (1) and has a larger surface area than the
latter.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the protective foil (6) adheres directly to the

presentation sheet (3).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that adhesive spots (7) are provided on the presentation

sheet (3), these spots being arranged so as to enable
the protective foil border (8) extending beyond the

backing foil to be made to adhere to the sheet. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the backing foil (1) is

oleophobic or comprises an oleophobic material, so as
to reject fatty substances, essential oils and

perfumes.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said foil is made of treated polyethylene or

aluminium.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the protective foil (6) is

oleophilic or comprises an oleophilic material.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the said foil is made of treated polyethylene or

aluminium.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the gel comprises, in addition to

the perfume, a viscosity-enhancing agent, an emulsifier,
an emollient, a biodegradable binder and water.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the gel comprises between 1.5 and 3% of perfume,

between 0.2 and 0.6% of viscosity-enhancing agent,
between 2 and 5% of emulsifier, between 0.1 and 0.5% of

emollient, between 15 and 30% of biodegradable binder
and the remainder water, these percentages being taken

with respect to the total weight of the gel.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the perfume sample backing foil

(1) adheres by means of adhesive bonding to the
presentation sheet (3).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that it comprises several separate

perfume samples applied to the backing foil.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that the abovementioned sample backing

and protective foils are opaque.
