<ABSTRACT>
In the process for residue treatment in refuse incineration plants, in which, in addition to slag, hydrogen chloride arises from the flue gas scrubber, the slag after preceding mechanical comminution is washed with the crude hydrochloric acid from the wet scrubber of the flue gas purification plant. The chloride content in the slag thus treated is reduced after this by washing with water and the heavy metal chlorides in both washwaters are precipitated out by addition of soda. End products of this treatment are slag in building material quality and usable common salt.

<CLAIMS>
Process for residue treatment in refuse 
incineration plants in which, in addition to slag, 

hydrogen chloride arises from the flue gas scrubbing, 
characterized in that the slag, after prior mechanical 

comminution, is washed with the crude hydrochloric acid 
from the wet scrubber of the flue gas purification 

plant, and the chloride content in the slag thus 
treated is reduced by washing with water. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that after the separation of slag and wash water, 

the metal chlorides are precipitated in both wash 
waters by addition of soda. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that, for the further reduction of the heavy metal 

concentration in the wash water, sulphide reagents, 
preferably trimercaptotriazine, are added to the wash 

water. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, after the separation of slag and 

wash water, the slag is treated with lime, preferably 
in the form of milk of lime, for the purpose of 

immobilizing the traces of heavy metals remaining in 
the slag.
