<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an automatic control device for the flow of air in a ventilation or air-conditioning installation or similar. This device essentially comprises a body (1) comprising an inlet (2) in the form of a nozzle neck (4) which is followed by at least one flap (5) which is articulated on the body (1) on the side of its outlet (3), permanently stressed by a spring (11) in the position of maximum opening of the air passage (P) into the body (1) and capable of being displaced under the effect of the difference between the upstream pressure being exerted on the external face (5a) of the flap (5) and transmitted by openings (6) made in the inlet (2) of the body (1) in the form of a nozzle neck (4) and the pressure being exerted on the internal face (5b) of the flap (5) after passage of the air through the inlet (2). This device can be placed in, for example, a pipe, a mouth or a box to control automatically therein the flow of air which passes through it.
