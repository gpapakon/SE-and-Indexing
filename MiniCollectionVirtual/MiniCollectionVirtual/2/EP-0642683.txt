Process for developing a programmed ASIC integrated circuit dedicated to 
an application incorporating on a same chip : 


a signal processor core (2), 
a RAM memory (3) 
a ROM memory (4) intended to receive a management software and a processing 
software. 
input-output management peripherals (5) specific to the application, the signal 
processor (2), the RAM memory (4) and the ROM memory (3) corresponding 

respectively to existing discrete components, 
 
characterized in that the processing software is developed and tested, at least partially 

before the production of a programmable version of the ASIC circuit, on a test 
platform comprising at least said discrete components (2,3,4) with the aid of an 

interface software which allows the platform to be controlled and automatic chaining 
of tests from a microcomputer. 
The IC development process of claim 1, characterized in that a 
programmable (open) version of the programmed ASIC and a test platform (for this 

programmable IC) are produced in order to develop and test the processing software. 
The IC development process of claim 1, characterized in that a 
programmed (closed) version of the IC and a test platform (for this closed IC) are 

produced in order to validate all the processing and management software. 
The IC development process of any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the tests conducted on the test platform include direct digital data communications 

between the microcomputer and the test platform, independently of the input-output 
management peripherals (5) specific to the application.  

 
The IC development process of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the tests conducted on the test platform include the remote loading of a program from 

the microcomputer into the RAM memory (3) of the test platform. 
The IC development process of any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
by simulation or experimentation, a data base of tests and of their results is formed in 

the microcomputer. 
The IC development process of claim 6, characterized in that the results 
obtained from the tests and expected results (stored in the data base) corresponding to 

either simulations or previous experiments, are compared. 
The IC development process of any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 

the management software allows activation (deactivation) of test and display points 
defined in the processing software, display of the contents of memories and main 

registers of the core of the DSP (or microprocessor) and execution of the software 
either in or outside real time to validate it. 
The IC development process of any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 
an interface software allows control of the test platform and chaining of tests of the 

processing software in automatic fashion in and outside of real time.
