<ABSTRACT>
A smartcard that allows different Service Providers to coexist on the smartcard
with none of the Service Providers, nor the owner of the smartcard, havi
ng access to the
files created for, or by, each of the resident Service Providers. The operating system of

the smartcard includes a root directory that is owned by the smartcard's issuer/owner, and
each Service Provider is a "user" that is installed by the issuer/owner. Each such user is

provided with a subdirectory of the root directory, and within the subdirectory the user
creates files and subdirectories with files, as the user deems necessary. The operating

system prevents all users of the smartcard, including the smartcard's issuer/owner and the
smartcard's holder, from accessing any files that are owned by any other user, when that

user chooses to prevent such access. This power to exclude is effected through a
password file that is owned by the user and which cannot be altered by any other user,

including the smartcard's issuer/owner. Optionally, the smartcard's issuer/owner is given
the power to erase all files of a given user. Connection is effected with a protocol which

authenticates all parties to the connection. Thus, in a connection between the smartcard
and a user, the smartcard determines whether the user should be granted access, and the

user determines whether the smartcard is a valid smartcard. Authentication of the
possessor of the smartcard may also be effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to smartcards.Advances in microelectronics have made it possible to put a vast amount of computing power in a small space. In fact, it is possible to effectively put an entire computer inside a credit card, creating thereby a "smartcard". Because of the tremendous processing and memory capabilities of the smartcard, it is expected that smartcards will supplant conventional credit cards which, typically, serve to confirm the right of the card's holder to debit a given account. Smartcards will provide a higher level of assurance that the smartcard possessor is the rightful Holder. This will solve a major problem of conventional credit cards. Moreover, smartcards will be more than an "authorizer" to debit (or credit) an account. For example, they will "carry" pre-approved credit.To allow smartcards to fulfill their promise, Service Providers must feel secure that the computer within the smartcard cannot be employed for improper uses. A number of approaches have already been used for meeting this need. First, smartcards are provided with a power port and a single information pass-through port. Second, the computer embedded in the smartcard operates under control of an operating system which insures that instructions sent to the computer do not carry out operations that are detrimental to the card's purpose and security guidelines; i.e., only instructions that read and alter permitted data areas are allowed. Third, the issuers of today's smartcards insist on populating the card on the provider's premises and not through remote communication.The memory in smartcards is large enough to hold the programs and data of a number of service providers. That is, there is sufficient memory to allow, for example, VISA, AMERICAN EXPRESS, and MASTERCARD to coexist on a single smartcard. Alas, smartcards have yet to be developed that, in a commercial sense, have succeeded in carrying the services of more than one Service Provider. It is believed that the reasons for this state of affairs is a number of security problems have not been solved. One problem, for example, arises in connection with who is the card's owner, and what powers does the owner have over all the files in the smartcard's memory. Stated in commercial terms, the question is to what extent does the owner of a smartcard (who may also be a Service Provider) have powers over the smartcard that are inconsistent with the security that other Service Providers seek. This is a trust issue.A second issue relates to remote provisioning.

<CLAIMS>
A multiple-applieation smartcard including a processor and memory in connection with which there is an issuer/owner, a holder and a service provider, comprising;

an operating system that includes a tree-like file structure that begins with a file having characteristics that are controlled solely by said issuer/owner;
a plurality of files, forming part of the tree-like structure and each having file characteristics that are controlled solely by said issuer/owner, which files are executable files, in the sense that, when referenced, they operate on permissible data in said memory;
a first password file (12) that is accessible only to said issuer/owner, which contains data and which is accessed by said issuer/owner prior to said issuer/owner gaining access to said executable files;
a second password file (16) that is accessible only to said holder, which contains data and which is accessed by said holder prior to said holder gaining access to said executable files; an
a third password file (21) that is accessible only to said service provider, which contains data and which is accessed by said service provider prior to said service provider gaining access to said executable files.
In connection with a smartcard (S) issued by a first party (O), where the smartcard includes a memory and an operating system having a tree-like file structure that begins with a directory file (10) with attributes that are controlled solely by said first party (O), a plurality of files, forming part of the tree-like structure and each having file attributes that are controlled solely by said first party (O), which files are executable files, in the sense that, when referenced, they operate on permissible data in said memory, and a first password file (12) that is accessible only to said first party (O) and which is accessed by said first party (O) prior to said first party gaining access to said executable files, a method for installing capability for a second party (SP) to provide service to a holder (P, H) of the smartcard, comprising the steps of:

said holder (P, H) assisting (100, 102, 103) in establishing communication between the smartcard (S) and said first party (O);
executing a log-in protocol (101, 104-107) between the smartcard (S) and said first party (O), employing the data contained in said first password file (12);
communicating to said first party (O) a request (120-122) for installation of a service capability on said smartcard for said second party (SP);
said first party establishing a user password file (16) in said smartcard, with said user password tile (16) arranged to form part of said tree-like structure;
said first party (O) inserting data into said user password file (16); and
said first party (O) changing file attributes of said user password file (16) to make it accessible only to said second party (SP).
The method of claim 2 further comprising a step of informing said second party (SP) of the data stored in the user password file.
The method of claim 2 further comprising a step, executed by said first party (O) following said step of communicating to said first party a request for installation, of confirming (123, 124) with said second party (SP) that the request for installation of service should he fulfilled.
The method of claim 2 wherein said communication is employing a telecommunication network.
