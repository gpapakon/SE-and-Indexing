<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bicyclooctane and bicycloheptane 
derivatives, and more particularly to bicyclooctane and 
bicycloheptane derivatives which bind to cholecystokinin 
and/or gastrin receptors. The invention also relates to 
methods for preparing such bicyclooctane and bicycloheptane 
derivatives and to compounds which are useful as 
intermediates in such methods. Gastrin and the CCK's are structurally-related neuropeptides 
which exist in gastrointestinal tissue and in the CNS (see 
Mutt V., GastrointestinalHormones, Glass G.B.J., ed., Raven 
Press, N.Y., p 169 and Nisson G., ibid, p. 127). Gastrin is one of the three primary stimulants of gastric 
acid secretion. Several forms of gastrin are found 
including 34-, 17-, and 14-amino acid species with the 
minimum active fragment being the C-terminal tetrapeptide 
(TrpMetAspPhe-NH2) which is reported in the literature to 
have full pharmacological activity (see Tracey H.J. and 
Gregory R.A., Nature (London), 1964, 204, 935). Much effort 
has been devoted to the synthesis of analogues of this 
tetrapeptide (and the N-protected derivative Boc-TrpMetAspPhe-NH2) 
in an attempt to elucidate the 
relationship between structure and activity. Natural cholecystokinin is a 33 amino acid peptide (CCK-33), 
the C-terminal 5 amino acids of which are identical to those 
of gastrin. Also found naturally is the C-terminal 
octapeptide (CCK-8) of CCK-33. The cholecystokinins are reported to be important in the 
regulation of appetite. They stimulate intestinal motility, 
gall bladder contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion, and 
are known to have a trophic action on the pancreas. They 
also inhibit gastric emptying and have various effects in 
the CNS.  
 Compounds which bind to cholecystokinin and/or gastrin 
receptors are important because of their potential 
pharmaceutical use as antagonists of the natural peptides. A number of gastrin antagonists have been proposed for 
various therapeutic applications, including the prevention 
of gastrin-related disorders, gastrointestinal ulcers, 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, antral G cell hyperplasia and 
other conditions in which lowered gastrin activity is 
desirable. The hormone has also been shown to have a 
trophic action on cells in the stomach and so an antagonist 
may be expected to be useful in the treatment of cancers, 
particularly in the stomach. Possible therapeutic uses for cholecystokinin antagonists 
include the control of appetite disorders such as anorexia 
nervosa, and the treatment of pancreatic
