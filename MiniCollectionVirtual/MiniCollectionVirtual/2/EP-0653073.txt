If high-frequency noise is present and exhibits a gap occurring every half-cycle of the power frequency, arcing is determined to be present, and an alarm (80) is given.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inexpensive detector of
electrical arcs on power lines, for providing advance warning
of potentially dangerous conditions.Electrical arcs can develop temperatures well above the
ignition level of most common flammable materials, and therefore
pose a significant fire hazard. For example, worn power cords
in the home may arc sufficiently to start a fire. Fortunately,
arcing is an inherently unstable phenomena and does not usually
persist long enough to start a fire. Under certain conditions,
reflected in particular characteristics of the electrical
disturbance produced, the likelihood of the arc persisting and
starting a fire is much higher. It is one object of the present
invention to provide a method and apparatus to detect such
potentially dangerous arcs by monitoring voltage disturbances
on the power lines.Two basic types of arcing are likely to occur in the home;
line fault arcing and contact arcing. An arc due to a line
fault results from either a line-to-line short or a line-to-ground
short. When a fault of this type occurs several things
are likely to happen: 1) the fault will draw current up to or
beyond the capacity of the circuit; 2) lights will dim
indicating an excessive load is being drawn; and 3) if the
circuit is properly protected by a circuit breaker, the breaker
will trip, interrupting supply of power to the arc. All of this
will likely occur and be completed in less than a second. The 
resulting arcing will be explosive but short-lived, reducing the
total heat to be dissipated by surrounding materials and thus
reducing the likelihood of a fire.Contact arcing results from a high resistance connection
in series with a load. This may occur due to loose connections,
oxidized contacts, or foreign non-conducting material
interfering with the conduction path.One example of a condition that may cause contact arcing
is a well-used wall outlet wherein the spring pressure provided
by the contacts has been reduced through age and use, so that
insufficient pressure is applied to the inserted plug contacts
to ensure low-resistance connection.Contact arcing is also commonly caused by use of extension
cords of insufficient current-carrying capacity. For example,
the plug may be heated by resistance heating, gradually
decomposing elastomeric insulating material around the contacts
until the material partially flows into the contact area,
preventing proper contact from being made. This process may
become regenerative as the initial arcing produces more heat,
carbonizing the
