<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises repeatedly depositing inside a quartz reaction 
tube a soot-like core forming glass (26) at different temperatures, by 

which a distribution of a doping concentration in the radial 
direction of the core can be set as desired. 
A modification to the process comprises forming two 
constricted portions (28) at opposite ends of a quartz reaction tube (4), 

charging a solution of a compound of a rare earth element as a 
solution into the section of the tube 

between the constricted portions (28) 
for doping. By this method, the doping concentration becomes uniform 

along the length of an optical fiber preform (30) with defects 
being rarely produced and without any 

complicated operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is divided from European 
patent application 90 916 042.6. This invention relates to a process for producing an 
optical fiber preform which comprises: the first step of 
forming a soot-like core glass by heating fine powder of 
an oxide glass deposited by vapour phase reaction in a 
quartz reaction tube, the second step of impregnating a 
solution of a compound of a rare earth element used as a 
solute in said soot-like core glass, the third step of 
heating the solute-containing soot-like core glass until 
the glass is vitrified, and the fourth step of heating 
said quartz reaction tube for collapsing. Such a process 
is disclosed in Materials Letters vol. 6, no. 5/6, March 
1988 pages 139-144. Light amplifiers in which light signals are directly 
amplified without conversion into electric signals have been 
extensively studied in various research and investigation 
facilities and expected as a key device of future light 
transmission systems. This is because the light amplifier 
is, in fact, free of any bit rate with ease in great 
capacitance and information from a multichannel can be 
amplified as a whole One of such a light amplifier is a 
light amplifier which makes use of an optical fiber whose 
cores is doped with a rare earth element (or ion) such as Er, 
Nd, Yb or the like (which may be hereinafter referred to 
simply as "doped fiber") and wherein signal light and 
pumping light are introduced into the doped fiber in the 
same or opposite directions. The optical fiber amplifier  
 
using the doped fiber has the advantages that the gain is 
not of the polarization dependence with low noises and that 
the combination loss with a transmission path is small. 
This type of optical fiber amplifier may be particularly 
applied in the following manner. 
(a) At the transmission side, the optical fiber 
amplifier is employed as an optical power booster to 
compensate for a possible loss or to increase the 
transmission power. (b) At the receiving side, the optical fiber amplifier 
is used as an optical pre-amplifier to improve the receiving 
sensitivity. (c) The optical fiber amplifier is used as a repeater 
to make a small-sized and reliable repeater. With light whose wavelength is in the range of 0.8 - 
1.6 Âµm, production and application techniques of optical 
fibers using quartz glass adapted for long-range 
transmission have been established. The optical fiber is 
obtained by drawing an optical fiber preform in the form of 
a thick rod. The optical fiber preform should have
