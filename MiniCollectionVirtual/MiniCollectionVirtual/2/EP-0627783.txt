<ABSTRACT>
The antenna of the invention comprises radiating sources having a multi-layer dielectric/conductor structure and a multiplicity of coupled elements distributed over the interfaces between the successive dielectric layers, fed by a single radiating block situated on the lower level of the antenna. The geometric parameters of the conducting patches and of their distributions on successive layers confer great flexibility in the antenna design, especially as far as the simultaneous optimisation of antenna parameters are concerned, such as: directivity, pass band, efficiency (by minimising distribution loses), the purity of the polarisation, and the symmetry of the radiating diagram. These advantages of the invention stem principally from the possibility for increasing the radiating aperture of a source without increasing the complexity of the passive distributors for distributing the radiated signals. This is achieved by the coupling of the elements between levels, and by the production of a geometry which makes it possible to increase the equivalent radiating surface at each successive level.

a plurality of levels including a bottom level and at least one
upper level occupying an upper portion;
a plurality of radiating elements (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6; R21,
R22, R23, R24, R25, R26) disposed in the upper portion; and
excitation means (E, D1, C, M) for electromagnetic excitation
of said radiating elements, disposed in said bottom level;
said radiating elements being excited by a distribution of
electromagnetic excitation energy between said elements, said

distribution being performed by electromagnetic coupling between said
elements, said upper portion comprising at least two upper levels,

said radiating elements being distributed on a plurality of
dielectric substrates (D2, D3, ...) stacked in successive levels in a

multilayer radiating structure, said multilayer radiating structure

bottom level, characterized in that:
each dielectric substrate of said upper portion (D2, D3, ...)
includes a plurality of radiating elements (R1, ... R6; R21, ...,

R26), and in that said structure is made up in such a manner that
each successive dielectric substrate includes radiating elements

occupying an area that is larger than the area occupied by the
radiating elements of the preceding level, starting from a bottom

first level that contains said excitation means (E, D1, C, M).
A radiating structure according to claim 1, characterized in that
it does not include special means for distributing excitation

electromagnetic energy between said elements, said distribution being
achieved solely by coupling of magnetic currents generated by each

element.
A radiating structure according to claim 2, characterized in that
it does not comprise special means for coupling excitation

electromagnetic energy between said levels, said excitation being
performed solely by coupling of magn
etic current generated by the 
elements in the immediately lower level exciting the elements in the

immediately higher level.
A radiating structure according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said bottom level includes a single radiating

patch (E) which is excited by said excitation means (C) and which in
turn excites the radiating elements (R1, ..., R6) of the next level,

and so on.
A radiating structure according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that said first radiating patch (E) which is to be

found on said bottom level of the multilayer structure is fed so as

said radiating elements of at least one of said upper levels are

disposed so as to form a radiating structure suitable for reinforcing
and refining the polarization of the transmitted radiation.
A radiating structure according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the radiating elements (R21, ..., R26) of an

upper level partially overlie the radiating elements (R1, ..., R6) of
an immediately lower level when seen in projection in the stacking

direction of the levels, and in that the coupling between the
elements of contiguous levels is governed by the percentage overlap

of said elements in magnetic current zones, and also by the thickness
and the dielectric qualities of the separators.
A radiating structure according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that said polarization is circular, and in that it is obtained by

using excitation by sequential rotation in a coupled structure.
A radiating structure according to any one of claims 5 to 6 or 8,
characterized in that it is fitted with a polarizing grid.

A radiating structure according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that said dielectric substrates (D1, D2, D3, ...)
