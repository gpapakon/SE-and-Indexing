<ABSTRACT>
In an electrical socket, fins 53 to 55 projecting 
rearwards from a front wall of the socket are received in 

slots 32, 58 and 31 when pins of a correct plug are 
correctly inserted but, when a single pin is inserted, the 

shutter 15 is tilted laterally and causes free end faces of 
tongues 66, 67 and 68 of the shutter to abut against the 

fins 53, 54 and 55 to retain the shutter closed. In an 
alternative embodiment, the shutter has to be displaced 

rearwardly to beyond stops on the front wall before it can 
be cammed linearly upwardly to open it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to safety devices incorporated 
into electrical sockets. In electrical sockets used for connecting various items 
of equipment, especially domestic appliances, it is 
necessary to obtain characteristics of safety in usage; 
above all it should be impossible to introduce any 
electrically conductive objects to beyond the socket 
openings for the plug pins, thus preventing accidents which 
could occur in practice. There are various devices which are intended to prevent 
the introduction of conductive elements other than the 
corresponding electrical plug pins into the connection 
openings of sockets. For example, there are the 
conventional caps which are fitted into the openings of 
sockets and which have to be removed in order to fit the 
electrical plugs. Nevertheless, these caps present the 
traditional problems that in some cases they can easily be 
removed by small children and also they can fall out quite 
easily, so their efficacy is not guaranteed. Also it is known, especially from British Patents Nos. 
501,609; 545,743; 870,845; 1210359 and 1210360 that there 
are some devices in which a rotating safety element is 
incorporated in the socket, so that, when the plug pins are 
introduced, the rotating element is made to turn, thus 
freeing the socket openings. In this type of device, there 
is provided a torsion spring in addition to the electrical 
contact members of the socket. There is also known from Spanish Utility Model No. 
287,727 a safety device for sockets, in which the protection 
is intended to be obtained by means of a linearly 
displaceable shutter formed with cams whereby the shutter 
can be linearly opened by the actual pins of the plug when 
connection is made. Although this device has significant 
advantages in the simplicity of its construction and its 
operating efficiency, it may be possible to overcome the  
 
safety device by introducing a sharp object into one of the 
openings of the socket and forcing it hard against the 
relevant cam. The main object of the present invention is to increase 
the safety of electrical sockets. According to one aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided an electrical socket comprising a wall through 
which are formed openings for receiving electrical contact 
pins of an electrical plug, a shutter having a closed 
condition behind said openings and linearly movable from 
said closed condition to an open condition by pushing action 
of said pins inserted through said openings, and biassing 
means urging said
