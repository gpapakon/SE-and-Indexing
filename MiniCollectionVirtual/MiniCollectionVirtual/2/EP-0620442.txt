<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention applies to a circuit for
sampling of an analog, time continuous signal for display on a
CRT tube or for digitization by an analog to digital converter
as in a digital sampling oscilloscope. In particular, it
applies to a charge sampling circuit rather than a voltage
sampling circuit and also to the use of this sampling circuit.Among digital sampling oscilloscopes distinct
classes can be distinguished taking into account their mode of
operation :
a) real time or single shot digitizing instruments
where the sample rate is between 2 and 10 times the highest
frequency of interest,b) equivalent time or repetitive instruments which
are used with repetitive signals, sampling them at a frequency 
lower than the highest frequency of interest (undersampling)
and reconstructing the signal by taking many cycles of the
signal to acquire enough data to reconstruct the signal,
putting every sample in its proper time position.The present invention applies to this latter class
of instruments which dominate the field of data acquisition
with a bandwidth above 1GHz. Equivalent time or repetitive
sampling instruments can again be divided into two classes :
a) sequential sampling instruments which sample a
repetitive signal once every n-th cycle, sequentially
incrementing the time of sampling relative to the signal
cycle. In order to be able to do this, a trigger signal must
first be extracted from the signal or from an external source
and a sequentially incremented delay added between the trigger
point and the sample point. Because it is difficult to produce
long delays accurately and because of jitter in the cycle
length, a sequential sampling instrument can only accurately
view the portion of the signal which occurs after the trigger
point.b) Random Interleaved Sampling (RIS) instruments
which sample the signal at their own internal rate, which is
randomly related to the signal cycle, which record for every
sample acquisition the precise time position of the sample
relative to the signal cycle. The signal is then reconstructed
by putting every data point in its proper time slot. The big
advantage of this technique is that a RIS instrument is not
restricted to show the post trigger part of the signal but can
also display the portion of the signal which precedes the
trigger point. A known sampling system for use in an oscilloscope
is described in the document US-4,069,447 in which the signal
is sampled and stored in a capacitor. This illustrates the
common technology for sampling a signal with the
