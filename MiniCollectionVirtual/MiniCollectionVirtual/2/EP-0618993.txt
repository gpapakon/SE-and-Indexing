<ABSTRACT>
In a set of metal section bars (1; 74) for door and window frames with sliding panels the vertical section bars (1; 74, 68) of the fixed frame comprise a main casing (2; 71) provided on one side with wall hooking means (12, 13) and on the other side with a pair of end fins (6, 7) and with a pair of connecting fins (8, 69) in the proximity of one (6) of said end fins (6, 7) and destined to engage with an adjacent vertical section bar of the mobile frame of a sliding panel. In addition, a draught-protection fin (10, 70) extends from said other part of the main casing (2, 71) in a position that is substantially symmetrical with said one end fin (6) with respect to said pair of connecting fins (8, 69). The connecting fins (8, 69) have a base that is enlarged with respect to free extremities that engage with the vertical section bar of the mobile frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a set of metal section 
bars for door and window frames with sliding panels. As is known, door and window frames made of metal with 
sliding panels are accomplished with a fixed frame formed by a 
pair of upper and lower horizontal section bars and by a pair 
of vertical side section bars, and with one or two mobile 
frames formed by similar pairs of horizontal and vertical 
section bars and by incorporated glass panes, that define 
respective sliding panels. In door and window frames of the traditional type the 
section bars are made in one piece in a material such as, say, 
alluminiun alloy. In door and window frames providing thermal insulation each 
section bar is, on the other hand, accomplished in two distinct 
parts corresponding to the internal front and to the external 
front of the door and window frame. The two parts are 
connected together through insulating strips made, say, in 
polyamide. CH-A-615 243 discloses a vertical 
section bar for a fixed frame constituted by a main casing provided on one 
side with wall hooking means, on the other side by a pair of 
end fins and by a pair of connecting fins with a rectilinear 
shape, destined to engage with an adjacent vertical section bar 
of the mobile frame of a sliding panel. Still according to this embodiment the seal between the 
vertical side section bar of the fixed frame and that of the  
 
mobile frame of the panel is often unsatisfactory and not in a 
position to prevent the passage of air and water. EP-A-0 009 652 discloses a closure "U" shaped section bar 
which is connected to vertical section bars of a fixed frame. A 
mobile frame of a sliding panel is guided in said "U" shaped 
section bar by means of interposed weather strips which act as 
end-of-sliding stroke seals. Said closure "U" shaped section bar and the end-of-stroke 
seals are equivalent as structure and as function to the pair 
of rectilinear connecting fins and weather strips shown in 
CH-A-615 243 (Figs. 11 and 12). Any section bar does not comprise labyrinth-type seals for 
preventing the passage of water and air. US-A-4 922 661 discloses a water stop formed by a low 
vertical wall member which extends horizontally parallel to 
tracks of the window panes and is placed in a lower part of a 
window. Said horizontal wall member in the lower part of a window 
has the drawback that possible infiltrations of water would be 
blocked by the wall member and remain trapped between said wall 
member and an internal track, because the water cannot

<CLAIMS>
Set of metal section bars comprising vertical (1; 74, 
68) and horizontal section bars for a fixed frame and vertical 

and horizontal section bars for a mobile frame, wherein each 
vertical section bar (1; 74, 68) for a fixed frame comprises a 

main casing (2; 71) provided on one side with wall hooking 
means (12, 13) and on the other side with a pair of end fins 

(6, 7) and with a pair of connecting fins (8, 69) in the 
proximity of one (6) of said end fins (6, 7) and destined to 

engage with an adjacent vertical section bar of the mobile 
frame of a sliding panel, characterized in that 

said vertical section bar (1; 74, 68) also 
comprises a draught-protection fin (10, 70) extending from said 

other part of the main casing (2, 71) in a position that is 
substantially symmetrical with said end fin (6) with respect to 

said pair of connecting fins (8, 69), to form a labyrinth between 
said vertical section bars of the fixed frame and of the mobile 

frame. 
Set of metal section bars according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that said connecting fins (8, 69) have a base 

that is enlarged with respect to free extremities that engage 
with the vertical section bar of the mobile frame. 
Set of metal section bars according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that said vertical section bar (1) for a fixed 

frame is made in one piece. 
Set of metal section bars according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that said vertical section bar (74, 68) is 

made in two separate elements (74, 68) that may be connected 
together, one (74) of said elements consisting in turn of two 

metal half-casings (71) including respective end fins (6, 7) 
and connected by insulating strips (72) and the other (68) of 

said elements being constituted by an insulating insert 
including said connecting fins (69) and said draught-protection  

 
fin (70).
