<ABSTRACT>
An inkjet printer (10) including a first inkjet pen 
(22) having a first electrical contact and a second 

inkjet pen (22) having a second electrical contact the 
improvement which includes: a substrate (88); a third 

electrical contact (96) on the substrate (88) coupled to 
the first electrical contact on the first inkjet pen 

(22); a fourth electrical contact (96) on the substrate 
(88) coupled to the second electrical contact on the 

second inkjet pen (22); and a conductive layer (122) 
deposited on the substrate (88) electrically 

interconnecting the third electrical contact (96) to the 
fourth electrical contact (96). The improved unitary 

interconnect system (56) provides an interconnect system 
that reduces cost, is easier to assemble and align, and 

provides ground plane sharing for all of the inkjet pens.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interconnect systems and
more particularly to interconnect systems for multiple
inkjet pens in an inkjet printer.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention is
not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the
art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields
in which the present invention would be of significant
utility.Inkjet printer/plotters and desktop printers, such as
those sold by Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial
improvements in speed over the conventional X-Y plotter.
Inkjet printer/plotters typically include a pen having an
array of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a carriage which
is moved across the page in successive swaths. Each inkjet
pen has heater circuits which, when activated, cause ink to
be ejected from associated nozzles. As the pen is
positioned over a given location, a jet of ink is ejected
from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at a desired
location. The mosaic of pixels thus created provides a
desired composite image. Inkjet technology is now well known in the art.
See, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled
PRINTER HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued
October 3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593,
entitled PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October 23,
1990, to M. S. Hickman.Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters and
desktop printers have been developed which comprise a
plurality of inkjet pens of diverse colors. A typical
color inkjet printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that
stores black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g.,
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three color
pens are mixed to obtain any particular color.The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required for
interfacing to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens.Conventionally, a carriage assembly consists of four
pen stalls to align the inkjet pens, four pen clamps to
hold the inkjet pens in the pen stalls, a printed circuit
board having the circuitry for interfacing to the heater
circuits in the inkjet pens, and four separate flexible
circuits interconnected between the printed circuit board
and electrical contacts on

fourth and fifth electrical contact are each further

characterized by:

a protrusion (118) on the substrate (88); and
gold deposited on the protrusion (118).
The interconnect system of claim 3 is further characterized
by:
