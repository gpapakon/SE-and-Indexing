A method for dry development of an ultraviolet-sensitive 
resist layer containing silicon and effecting selectively 

a negative image development in which the resist layer 
remains at its exposed areas or a positive image development 

in which the resist layer remains at its unexposed 
areas, wherein 


a) the resist layer is produced by depositing linear or 
cyclic siloxanes with vinyl silanes from the gas 

phase, 
b) the chemical behaviour of the resist layer is modified 
by UV exposure in such a way that a latent image will 

be produced, 
c) the latent image is developed by means of an etch gas 
mixture in plasma, 
d) the etch gas mixture comprises at least the etch gas 
oxygen and the etch gas trifluoromethane CHF₃, which 

has a tendency towards polymerization, said two etch 
gases being jointly capable of converting silicon and 

carbon into a volatile compound, oxygen reacting with 
carbon in the resist layer, and oxygen reacting also 

with carbon in the trifluoromethane CHF₃, whereby 
fluorine is set free, and fluorine converting silicon 

of said resist layer into volatile SiF₄, 
e) a negative image development after the UV exposure  
 

being obtained at pressures of the etch gas mixture 
below 0.2 mbar and at an O₂/CHF₃ ratio ≥ 3:1, or, 

selectively, 
f) a positive image development after the UV exposure 
being obtained at pressures of the etch gas mixture 

exceeding 0.5 mbar and at an O₂/CHF₃ ratio ≤ 1:3. 
A method for dry development of an electron beam sensitive 
resist layer containing silicon and effecting 

selectively a negative image development in which the 
resist layer remains at its exposed areas or a positive 

image development in which the resist layer remains at 
its unexposed areas, wherein 


a) the resist layer is produced by depositing linear or 
cyclic siloxanes with vinyl silanes from the gas 

phase, 
b) the chemical behaviour of the resist layer is modified 
by electron-beam exposure in such a way that a latent 

image will be produced, 
c) the latent image is developed by means of an etch gas 
mixture in plasma, 
d) the etch gas mixture comprises at least the etch gas 
oxygen and the etch gas trifluoromethane CHF₃, which 

has a tendency towards polymerization, said two etch 
gases being jointly capable of converting silicon and 

carbon into a volatile compound, oxygen reacting with 
carbon in the resist layer, and oxygen reacting also 

with carbon in the trifluoromethane CHF₃, whereby 
fluorine is set free, and fluorine converting silicon 

of said resist layer into volatile SiF₄, 
e) a negative image development after the electron-beam  
 

exposure being obtained at pressures of the etch gas 
mixture exceeding 0.2 mbar and at an O₂/CHF₃ ratio ≤ 

1:3, or, selectively, 
f) a positive image development after the electron-beam 
exposure being obtained at pressures of the etch gas 

mixture exceeding 0.2 mbar and at an O₂/CHF₃ ratio ≥ 
3:1. 
A method for dry development of an ultravoilet-sensitive 
resist layer containing silicon according to claim 1, 

wherein 

the vinyl silanes are trivinyl methyl silane (TVMS) and 
the cyclic siloxanes are octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane. 
A method for dry development of an electron beam sensitive 
resist layer containing silicon according to claim 

2, wherein 

the vinyl silanes are trivinyl methyl silane (TVMS) and 
the cyclic siloxanes are octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane.
