<ABSTRACT>
The undesirable changes in curing characteristics 
of conductive silicone rubber compositions during aging 

can be suppressed by using silver powder containing 
less that 10 ppm of NH₄⁺ content and less than 5 ppm of 

SO₄²⁻ content. These concentrations are determined by 
extracting the powder in water under the conditions of 

121°C, 2 atm, and 100 % RH, for 20 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organosiloxane
compositions curable to electrically conductive
silicone rubber wherein the curing characteristics of
the composition do not vary substantially with the age
of the composition.The excellent electrical conductivity and
other properties of silicone rubber prepared from
curable compositions containing electrically conducting
additives has made such rubbers desirable for use in
special areas where heat resistance, flexing
resistance, and electrical conductivity are required.
JP-A 3-170581 proposes for these applications a curable
composition containing an organopolysiloxane containing
at least 2 alkenyl radicals per molecule, an
organohydrogensiloxane containing at least 2 silicon
atom-bonding hydrogen atoms in a molecule, a catalyst
containing a platinum group metal, and silver powder.The types of silver powder used for preparing
conductive silicone rubber can be classified as
1) reduced silver powder, obtained by reducing an aqueous
solution of silver nitrate with a reducing agent such
as hydrazine, formaldehyde or ascorbic acid;2) electrolytic silver powder deposited at the cathode
during electrolysis of an aqueous silver nitrate
solution, and3) atomized silver powder obtained by spraying molten
silver heated above 1000°C into water or an inert gas.The shapes of silver particles produced using
these three methods are typically classified as
granular, flake, dendritic, or amorphous. The flake
form of silver powder is particularly preferred because
it can form high conductivity silicone rubber.The electrically conductive organosiloxane
composition described in the above publication has 
disadvantages, including poor cure and degradation in
composition curability during aging, to such an extent
that the composition eventually will not cure at all.These problems are solved by the present
invention which provides a conductive silicone rubber
composition exhibiting reduced change in curability
during aging.We have conducted intensive studies in our
attempt to solve the problems associated with the prior
art. We found that these curing problems result from
contamination of the silver powder by ionic impurities,
such as NH4+ and SO42- during the manufacture or storage
of the powder. The present invention is based on our
finding that the undesirable changes in curing
characteristics can be suppressed by using silver
powder containing less that 10 ppm of NH4+ content and
less than 5 ppm of SO4 -2 content. These concentrations
are determined by extracting the powder in water
