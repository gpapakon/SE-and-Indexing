<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for cleaning 
contaminated aquatic soil material, in particular dredged 

material, comprising of separating the aquatic soil material 
into at least one sand fraction and at least one sludge 

fraction and subsequently separating the contaminants from 
both the sand fraction and the sludge fraction. Separation 

of the aquatic soil material into a sand fraction (11) and sludge 
fraction (10) preferably takes place by means of at least one 

hydrocyclone (9) and, after separation of the sludge fraction (10), 
the sand fraction (11) is guided over a jig (12). The contaminants can 

be separated from the fractions by means of specific 

flotation (19,26,27) techniques. 
The invention further relates to a device for performing 
the method and to the use of the sludge and/or sand 

obtained with the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
device for cleaning contaminated aquatic soil material, in 
particular dredged materials from for instance harbours and 
rivers. The contamination of the sediments of important 
rivers, estuaries and coastal waters in Europe is a 
significant environmental problem in respect of aquatic 
ecosystems, public health and drinking water supply. In 
addition, contaminated sediments likewise represent a threat 
to surface water and groundwater. Dangerous substances form 
a particular threat during upkeep operations such as 
dredging. An additional problem is that of dealing with 
dredged contaminated sediments. In many cases it is not 
possible to dump the sediments on land or at sea because of 
the level of contamination. Specific storage sites often 
have a limited capacity while the total cost of prolonged 
storage is becoming unacceptably high. There is in addition 
a growing resistance among the public to the building of new 
storage sites. Alternatives to storage and dumping are 
therefore desired. The separation of contaminated aquatic soil 
material into a contaminated fraction on the one hand and a 
clean re-usable fraction on the other is therefore very 
important. At the moment only a few such techniques are 
known which operate at an acceptable cost level. In addition 
a relatively large contaminated fraction still results with 
such methods which must in turn be dumped, stored or further 
processed. Aquatic soil material has a composition with a 
grain size distribution from gravel to clay. The gravel 
fraction hereof has a grain size of roughly larger than 2 
mm, the sand lies between 2 and roughly 0.050 mm (also the  
 
frequently found limit value of 0.063 mm), the silt (this is 
partly fine sand) has a size between 0.050 and 0.002 mm, 
while the fraction with the finest grain size, the lutum, is 
smaller than 0.002 mm. In the known cleaning art for dredged 
material the finest fractions such as silt and lutum, or 
only the lutum, are not cleaned or these finest fractions of 
the dredged material or the sludge are separated but not 
further cleaned. These fractions are then stored as 
contaminated concentrate. Because dredged material contains 
a relatively large amount of this fine material the volume 
of this contaminated fraction can become very large. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide a method with which cleaning of contaminated aquatic 
soil material, in particular dredged material, is achieved 
and whereby the volume of the

Method for cleaning contaminated aquatic soil 
material, such as dredged material, comprising of separating

fraction and a sludge fraction takes place by means of at 

least one hydrocyclone. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
