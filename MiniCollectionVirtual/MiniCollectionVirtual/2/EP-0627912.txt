<ABSTRACT>
Water soluble macromers are modified by addition of free radical polymerizable groups, such as those containing a carbon-carbon double or triple bond, which can be polymerized under mild conditions to encapsulate tissues, cells, or biologically active materials. The polymeric materials are particularly useful as tissue adhesives, coatings for tissue lumens including blood vessels, coatings for cells such as islets of Langerhans, coatings, plugs, supports or substrates for contact with biological materials such as the body, and as drug delivery devices for biologically active molecules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
coating and/or encapsulating surfaces and three-dimensional
objects with cross-linked networks of
water-soluble polymers.Microencapsulation technology holds promise in
many areas of medicine. For example, some important
applications are encapsulation of cells for the
treatment of diabetes (Lim, F., Sun, A.M.
"Microencapsulated islets as bioartificial endocrine
pancreas", (1980) Science 210, 908-910), encapsulation
of hemoglobin for red blood cell substitutes, and
controlled release of drugs. However, using the prior
art methods, the materials to be encapsulated are
often exposed to processing conditions, including
heat, organic solvents and non-physiological pHs,
which can kill or functionally impair cells or
denature proteins, resulting in loss of biological
activity. Further, even if cells survive the
processing conditions, the stringent requirements of
biocompatibility, chemical stability, immunoprotection
and resistance to cellular overgrowth, of the
encapsulating materials restrict the applicability of
prior art methods.For example, the encapsulating method based on
ionic crosslinking of alginate (a polyanion) with
polylysine or polyornithine (polycation) (Goosen, et
al., (1985) Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 27:146)
offers relatively mild encapsulating conditions, but
the long-term mechanical and chemical stability of
such ionically crosslinked polymers remains doubtful.
Moreover, these polymers when implanted in vivo are
susceptible to cellular overgrowth (McMahon, et al., 
(1990) J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 82(22), 1761-1765) which
over time restricts the permeability of the
microcapsule to nutrients, metabolites and transport
proteins from the surroundings. This has lead to
starvation and death of encapsulated islets of
Langerhorns (O'Shea, G. M. et al. (1986) Diabetes,
35:943-946).Thus, there remains a need for a relatively mild
cell encapsulation method which offers control over
properties of the encapsulating polymer and yields
membranes in the presence of cells which are
permselective, chemically stable, and very highly
biocompatible. A similar need exists for the
encapsulation of biological materials other than cells
and tissues, as well as materials contacting
biological materials.Materials are considered biocompatible if the
material elicits either a reduced specific humoral or
cellular immune response or does not elicit a
nonspecific foreign body response that prevents the
material from performing the intended function, and if
the material is
