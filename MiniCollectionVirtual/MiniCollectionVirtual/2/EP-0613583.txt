<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a fuse comprising a fuse element (10), in the form of a single wire, which is formed together with at least one terminal (11, 11a, 11b), in the form of a number of twisted wires. The fuse element and the conductor(s) are formed from the same wire, whereby part of the wire is moved back and forth a number of times to form at least one ring (21) or loop. The ring or loop is twisted into a conductor (11, 11a, 11b) in the form of a number of twisted strands, whereby one of the twisted strands is formed to be included, in part, in the terminal (11, 11a, 11b) twisted together with an additional number of wires and to constitute, in part, a fuse element (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing 
a fuse comprising a fuse element in the form of a wire and 
at least one terminal, the terminal having a larger cross 
section area than the fuse element. A fuse comprises a fuse element, for example in the form of 
a wire, which at elevated current is heated and melts, the 
fuse blows, and the component that the fuse protects is 
disconnected. In certain applications, such as fuses for protection of 
capacitor elements in power capacitors, the fuse comprises, 
in addition to the fuse element, also terminals which have a 
larger cross section area than the fuse element. The fuse element usually consists of a wire, preferably a 
metal wire of copper, aluminium, silver, alloys based on 
these metals, as well as nickel silver, or any other 
material with a resistivity and melting point suitable for 
the application. For a fuse element provided with terminals, the contacting, 
that is, the transition between terminal and fuse element, 
which with conventional technique is usually performed by 
means of soldering, welding or a mechanical pressure joint, 
is a critical step. The influence of heat from the 
soldering/welding or mechanical damage upon the contacting 
by means of the pressure joint weakens the fuse, preferably 
at the transition between terminal and fuse element. This 
has an adverse effect on the fuse and the protective function 
by the introduction of weakenings or other inhomogeneities 
in the fuse.  
 In connection with fuses in capacitor elements or in other 
components where the fuse is mounted "narrowly" and in close 
proximity to electrically loaded materials, all forms of 
mechanical pressure points must be avoided. For that reason, 
the transition between terminal and fuse element in fuses 
which make contact with or are mounted in close contact with 
electrically loaded materials, for example fuses mounted 
inside or adjacent to a capacitor element, must be of 
essentially the same dimension as the terminal, that is, no 
lumps of solder, welding material, mechanical clamps or the 
like, which exceed the dimensions of the terminal and create 
pressure points, can be allowed. The invention aims to propose a method whereby a fuse, which 
comprises a fuse element in the form of a thin wire and at 
least one terminal, the terminal having a larger cross 
section area than the fuse element, can be manufactured in 
an economic and rational way while at the same time avoiding 
the above-mentioned problems arising in connection with
