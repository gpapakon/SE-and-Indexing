<ABSTRACT>
Process for the continuous preparation of carboxylic acid chlorides (I) of the general formula R-COCl, in which R is a C-organic radical having 1 to 30 C atoms, by reaction of a carboxylic acid R-COOH (II) with a reaction product (III) of phosgene (IV) and an N,N-disubstituted formamide (V), in which II and III are passed in counter-current from below into a zone (2) packed with III of a reactor (1), the reaction mixture is allowed to rise in predominantly laminar flow, a phase separation into an upper phase I and a lower phase III' of predominantly III and resultant formamide being obtained and I being withdrawn from the upper phase and parts of the lower phase III' according to its formation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the continuous preparation of 
carboxylic acid chlorides (I) of the general formula 

R-COCl, where R is an organic radical having from 1 to 
30 carbon atoms, by reacting a carboxylic acid R-COOH 

(II) with a reaction product (III) of phosgene (IV) and 
an N,N-disubstituted formamide (V), wherein II and III 

are passed in cocurrent from below into a III-filled zone 
(2) of a reactor (1) which allows the reaction mixture to 

ascend in predominantly laminar flow, with a phase 
separation into an upper phase I and a lower phase III' 

comprising predominantly III and formamide formed being 
obtained and I being taken from the upper phase and parts 

of the lower phase III' commensurably with their formation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
phase III' formed in the reactor (1) together with phosgene 

(IV) is fed to a second reactor (6) in cocurrent and 
the reaction product (III) obtained is reintroduced into 

the reactor (1).
