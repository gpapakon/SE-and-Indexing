<ABSTRACT>
The drawframe contains a delivery cylinder (1) which is mounted stationarily in a machine stand (2). A feed cylinder and an intermediate cylinder, which each carry a driving wheel (23, 24) are mounted in a frame (8) which is displaceable in the machine stand (2) relative to the delivery cylinder (1) and which can be fixed by means of locking elements (12, 13). A toothed belt (22) runs around at least one of the driving wheels (23, 24) and around driveable a gearwheel (25) mounted in the machine stand (2). A tension roller (27) for the toothed belt (22) is mounted on a pivotable carrier (28). One of the locking elements (13) serves for fixing the frame (8), the pivotable carrier (28) and the machine stand (2) relative to one another. The toothed belt (22) forms a very simple drive for the driving wheels (23, 24) mounted in the displaceable frame (8). Before any displacement of the frame (8), the said one locking element (13) has to be released. The pivotable carrier (28) is thereby also freed, so that the tension roller (27) can not exert any excessive forces on the toothed belt (22).

A drafting arrangement in a textile machine, with a 
drivable delivery cylinder (1) which is held in a 

machine frame (2) in a stationary manner, and with a 
drivable feed cylinder (4) and at least one drivable 

intermediate cylinder (6) which each carry a drive 
wheel (33, 23) and are held in a frame (8, 9) which 

is adjustable in the machine frame (2) towards the 
delivery cylinder (1) and is fixable by detachable 

fixing elements (12, 13, 14, 15), with at least one 
drive belt (22), on which at least one tensioning 

roller (27) rests, being placed around at least one 
of the drive wheels (23) and around one drivable 

wheel (25), characterized in that the drivable wheel 
(25) is held in the machine frame (2), that the tensioning 

roller (27) for the drive belt (22) is held 
on a movable carrier (28) and that one of the fixing 

elements (13) is arranged in such a way so as to fix 
the frame (8, 9), the movable carrier (28) and the 

machine frame (2) with respect to one another. 
A drafting arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that two detachable fixing elements 

(12, 13) are arranged on at least one side of the 
frame (8, 9), one (12) of which fixes the frame (8, 

9) with respect to the machine frame (2) and the 
other (13) fixes the frame (8, 9), the movable carrier 

(28) and the machine frame (2) with respect to 
one another.
