<ABSTRACT>
A method of converting a mass of berries which have superficially adhered together during storage in a container back to individual berries, said method including the steps of directing the berry mass against an apertured stationary breaking means (9) to rendomly disassociate the adhered berries and produce berries and secondary masses of berries able to pass through the apertures, providing a moving breaking means (16) in adjacent relationship to said apertures and repeatedly impacting said secondary masses after passage through said apertures with said moving breaking means to disassociate adhered berries of said secondary masses and thereby reduce the secondary masses to individual berries.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BULK PRODUCT HANDLING METHOD AND APPARATUSThis invention relates to the handling of quantities of elements which are inherently discrete but prone to consolidate into a mass or a number of masses during bulk storage. Compressible elements with surface characteristics tending to stickiness fall into the above category and a prime example is the dried grape product known as sultanas.After sultanas are initially processed they are stored in bulk prior to packaging for supermarket and other sales outlets. The storage of sultanas in bulk in a holding container, which is commonly 1.2 meters cube, almost always results in the sultanas consolidating into a mass within the container. The nature of the mass can vary from container to container. In one container the mass may be comprised of a single block of sultanas adhering to each other whilst in other container the mass may be comprised of a number of lumps each made up of many sultanas adhering to each other. Removing the sultanas mass from the container and breaking it up, preferably into individual fruits which will flow readily in the packaging process, whilst causing as little damage as possible to the individual fruits is a major problem in the dried fruit industry.The present invention has as its object the alleviation of the above problem.The invention provides a method of converting a 

product mass comprised of normally discrete elements which superficially surface adhere to each other when bulk stored to substantially individual elements, said method including the steps of directing the product mass against an apertures stationary breaking means to randomly disassociate the adhered elements comprising said product mass and thereby produce elements and secondary masses of elements to a size able to pass through said apertures, providing a moving breaking means in adjacent relationship to said apertures and repeatedly impacting said secondary masses after passage through said apertures with said moving breaking means to disassociate adhered elements of said secondary masses and thereby reduce said secondary masses to individual elements.The invention further provides apparatus to carry out the method above, where the apparatus includes a chute with at least an inclined bottom and sides and with a discharge end, a stationary mass breaking means obstructing the discharge end of the chute, apertures in said stationary breaking means, a moving breaking means spaced from but adjacent the stationary breaking means, said moving breaking means including a

CLAIMS :
1. A method of converting a product mass comprised of normally discrete elements which superficially surface adhere to each other when bulk stored to substantially individual elements, said method including the steps of directing the product mass against an apertured stationary breaking means to randomly disassociate the adhered elements comprising said product mass and thereby produce elements and secondary masses of elements of a size able to pass through said apertures, providing a moving breaking means in adjacent relationship to said apertures and repeatedly impacting said secondary masses after passage through said apertures with said moving breaking means to disassociate adhered elements of said secondary masses and thereby reduce said secondary masses to individual elements.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1 including the preliminary steps of bulk storing the elements in a container with a opening bottom and bottom discharging the container onto a chute which will gravitationally direct the discharged product mass against the stationary breaking means.
3. Apparatus to carry out the method of claim 1, said 


apparatus including a chute with at least an inclined bottom and sides and with a discharge end, a stationary mass breaking means obstructing the discharge end of the chute, apertures in said stationary breaking means, a moving breaking means spaced from but adjacent the stationary breaking means, said moving breaking means including a conveying surface and strikers upstanding from said surface to impact against element masses passing through said apertures.
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein the stationary breaking means comprises a grille including a plurality of spaced apart bars with the spacing between the bars constituting said apertures.
5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein the bars in the grille are parallel and are arranged in zones with the bars of a first zone adjacent the bottom of the chute more closely spaced than the bars in a second zone spaced from the bottom of the chute.
6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 wherein the grille has a bottom edge which lies adjacent the bottom of the chute and the grille is movable in a plane generally transverse to the direction of travel of the element mass along the chute to allow variation in the distance between the end of the grille and the bottom of the chute. 


7. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6 wherein the moving breaking means is a belt conveyor with a portion of its path of travel in a plane which lies substantially parallel to a plane occupied by said grille, said strikers are transverse slats on the belt, said chute bottom at the discharge end of the chute lies closely adjacent the path of travel of top edges of said slats and the top edges of the slats immediately prior to passing the chute bottom as the discharge end of the chute are in substantially rubbing engagement with a sealing surface thereby preventing the escape of elements from said moving breaking means.
8. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6 in combination with a container support for use with a container having an opening bottom, said support including a container cradle adapted to releaseably couple to the container, a cradle raising and lowering means, a container bottom support means to maintain the container bottom in an operative relationship with said chute as the container cradle and the container supported thereby is elevated relative to said chute.
