<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for waste water treatment is described which essentially comprises a vertical, cylindrical vessel having an air inlet at the bottom and a waste water feed (11) in the upper part of the separation compartment (10) established. The outlet (16) of the treated water is provided at the bottom (12) of the separation compartment (10). A device, for example in the form of a diffuser (12a), is present which ensures distribution in extremely fine-bubbled form of the airstream introduced at the bottom (12) of the separation compartment (10).

<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of waste water,

in which the waste water is delivered in the upper part of a unidirectional separation
space (10) of an upright, cylindrical container via an intake (11), the waste water forming

a surface in the separation space (10) and a floor (12) of the container being assigned to
the separation space,
in which a stream of air is introduced at the lower end of the separation space (10) via a
device (12a) which ensures that the stream of air introduced is distributed as extremely

fine bubbles, and a counter-flow of extremely fine air bubbles to the waste water is
formed,
in which a major part of all solids in the waste water is precipitated and discharged, and
in which the treated water is discharged at the lower end of the separation space (10) via
an outlet (16),

characterised in that
the precipitation and discharge of the major part of all solids occurs at the surface, the
precipitation by means of the counter-flow of fine air bubbles to the waste water, and

the extremely fine distribution of the air flow occurs by means of the device (12a) on the
floor (12).
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the precipitation is enhanced by
means of at least one mechanical separation surface (14) present in the separation space

(10) when viewed in a vertical direction of flow.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the water speeds are regulated
by means of a controllable flap (18) provided on the floor (12) of the unidirectional

separation space (10).
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the discharge occurs by
means of a skimming device (15) in the upper part of the unidirectional separation space

(10).
