<ABSTRACT>
The upper orifice (3) has an inward-sloping section tilting into the fold pocket mouth (2) and extending over the width of the fold pocket. Inward sloping guide strips (4) tilting into the fold pocket mouth protrude into part of the mouth. The guide strips interlock with fingers (1), and, together with the continuous section (5), form a distributor guide with a continuous impact surface.

<CLAIMS>
Pocket folding machine with at least one pair of folding 
rollers and with at least one folding pocket having a 

rail (6) which extends over the width of the folding 
pocket and is fixed to lateral actuators and which has, 

on its side facing the mouth (2) of the folding pocket 
formed by an upper mouth element (3) and a lower mouth 

element (8), a plurality of fingers (1) the concave front 
end faces (7) of which lie in a common plane and which 

are movable by means of the rail (6) between a sheet 
stopping position inside the folding pocket and a sheet 

guiding position at the mouth (2) of the folding pocket, 
characterized in that the upper mouth element (3) has a 

portion (5) which extends over the entire width of the 
folding pocket and is inclined obliquely inwardly into 

the mouth (2) of the folding pocket and from which guide 
tabs (4) inclined obliquely inwardly into the mouth (2) 

of the folding pocket project into a portion of the mouth 
(2) of the folding pocket and interlock with the fingers 

(1) forming, together with the continuous portion (5), a 
sheet guide with a continuous impact surface.
