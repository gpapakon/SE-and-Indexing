<ABSTRACT>
A container and pressure sealing closure combination 
has a closure (24) which includes a rim portion (26) 

engaging the mouth (22) of the container (20), a 
substantially rigid central portion (28) and an annular 

toggle portion (30) pivotally connected to and 
interconnecting the rim portion and central portion. Upward 

movement of the central portion in response to internal 
pressure of the contents of the container pivots the toggle 

portion to urge the rim portion substantially radially 
outwardly against the mouth, thereby effecting a seal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to closure and 
container combinations, and more particularly, to closures 
which utilize the internal pressure of the container 
contents to effect a seal. Due to cost and safety considerations, it is 
desirable to fabricate carbonated beverage containers from 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). An advantage of using PET 
is that it is easily recyclable. However, with present 
designs, the carbonated beverage container itself is made of 
PET and includes a threaded mouth which receives a cap made 
of aluminum. The aluminum closure or cap includes a ring of 
perforations which forms a line of separation so that, when 
removed from the container, the cap leaves behind a thin 
aluminum ring. Accordingly, at some point in the recycling 
process, it is necessary to separate the aluminum ring from 
the PET material. This separation step would be eliminated 
if the entire container-closure combination could be made of 
PET. Since PET has a different strength than aluminum, it 
is necessary to design a different closure shape. One 
example of such closure and container is disclosed in 
Wiedmer US-A 3,825,144. That patent discloses a container 
closure for sealing bottles having pressurized contents and 
includes a sealing member having a deformable disk portion 
with an outwardly concave shape. The disk portion deforms 
in response to the internal pressure of the container 
contents. However, such a flexible closure is unsuitable 
for fabrication of PET, since the internal pressure of a 
typical carbonated beverage container is not sufficiently 
great to deform the entire surface of such a closure. Accordingly, there is a need for a container and 
closure design suitable for a carbonated beverage in which 
the closure can be made of a flexible plastic material such 
as PET. Further, a disadvantage with such closures is that  
 
they lack means for the gradual release of pressure within 
the container. As a result, there is a risk that when 
opening such a prior art closure, the closure is propelled 
from the container by the pressure from the contents within 
the container. Accordingly, there is a need for a container 
and closure mechanism in which the internal pressure 
generated by the contents of the container effects a seal 
and in which means are provided for the gradual equalization 
of pressure within the container during opening of the 
closure. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a container and pressure-sealing closure 
combination composed of a

<CLAIMS>
A container and pressure-sealing closure 
combination composed of a flexible plastic material, and 

comprising a generally cylindrically shaped container, an 
annular mouth and a disk portion deformable in response to 

the internal pressure of the container contents; the said 
combination being characterized in that the closure 

comprises a rim portion engaging said mouth, a substantially 
rigid central portion, and an annular toggle portion 

pivotally connected to and interconnecting said rim portion 
and said central portion, whereby upward movement of
 said 
central portion in response to internal pressure from 

contents of said container is effective to pivot said toggle 
portion to urge said rim portion substantially radially 

outwardly against said mouth, thereby effecting a seal. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 1, further characterized in that said rim portion 

includes an inner wall abutting an inner face of said mouth, 
an outer wall abutting an outer face of said mouth, and a 

top wall extending between said inner and outer walls and 
adjacent to an end of said mouth. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 2, further characterized in that said toggle portion 

is connected to and adapted to urge against said inner wall 
of said rim portion. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 2 or 3, further characterized in that said inner face 

tapers radially inwardly toward said end, whereby said inner 
wall is prevented from sliding toward said end when said 

closure effects a seal. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
any of Claims 2, 3 or 4, further characterized in that said 

inner face includes slot means for conducting pressurized 
gaseous contents of said container to the ambient between 

said closure and said container. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
 

any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in further including tab 
means projecting outwardly from said closure and positioned 

such that displacement of said tab means relative to said 
mouth deforms said closure sufficiently to break said seal. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 6, characterised in further including a frangible 

component activated by pivoting said tab means relative to 
said closure, such that when said frangible component is 

activated, reattachment of said closure to said container 
mouth is prevented. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 7, further characterized in that said frangible 

component includes a plurality of generally radially-extending 
slots formed in said rim portion. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
Claim 1, further characterized in that said toggle portion 

includes wedge means arranged such that upward movement of 
said central portion is effective to pivot said wedge means 

radially outwardly against said rim portion, thereby 
enhancing said seal. 
A container and closure combination as claimed in 
any preceding claim, further characterized in that said 

container includes a base means, and said closure is shaped 
to be retained in said base means subsequent to removal from 

said mouth.
