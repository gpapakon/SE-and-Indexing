<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a security counter having a substructure in which there are mounted one or more security panels which, for securing, can be rapidly moved out upwards by pneumatic cylinders or a rapid drive, by actuating a control device, and close the opening of the counter above the substructure. In the case of said security counter, it is provided that the one or more security panels can be extended via the one or more pneumatic drives provided or via one or more additional drives, in addition to another rapid drive, at a second speed which is substantially lower than the speed of extension of the security panels for securing, and that there is provided an actuating device for controlling the drive or drives for the second speed.

Security counter with a substructure (1), in which one or more 
security plates (5, 6, 7) are borne, which are rapidly movable out 

upwardly by one or more pneumatic cylinders (10) as drive or another 
type of rapid drive through actuation of an actuating equipment (15) of 

a control device (13) for the raid protection and which close the 
opening of the counter above the substructure, wherein the one or more 

security plates (5, 6, 7) are movable out by way of the one or by way of 
the several pneumatic drives (10) present or by way of the one other 

type of rapid drive present or by way of one or more additional rapid drives 
at a second speed which is substantially less than the speed of outward 

movement of the security plates for the raid protection, wherein an 
actuating device (14) of the control device (13) is provided for the 

control of the or each drive for the second speed, wherein the control 
device (13) is coupled with a switching equipment (16), which after the 

retraction of the or each extended security plate (5, 6, 7) into the 
substructure (1) automatically activates the control device (13) for the 

raid protection and deactivates the actuating device (14) for the 
control of the second speed so that the security plates (5, 6, 7) can be 

moved out rapidly on actuation of the actuating equipment (15) for the 
raid protection and wherein the switching equipment (16) is coupled with 

a change-over switch (17) of the actuating device (14), on the actuation 
of which the actuating equipment (15) is blocked for the rapid movement 

and the control for the slow speed of outward movement of the security 
plates (5, 6, 7) and the actuating device (14) for this are released. 
Security counter according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that 
several security plates (5, 6, 7) are provided, which are movable 

rapidly by way of one or by way of separate drives or subject to 
entraining coupling by means of one or more drives in case of protection 

and which are movable slowly by way of the drive or the same drives (10) 
or by way of one or more additional drives.  

 
Security counter according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that 
the security plates are elements of a roll-shutter. 
Security counter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that a speech installation, which contains a 

microphone and a loudspeaker and is installed in the frame of the 
counter or in the substructure, is activated on the upward movement of 

the plates or that a bulletproof speech window is provided in one of the 
security plates. 
Security counter according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the security plates consist of steel, security glass 

(armoured glass) or bulletproof synthetic material or compound material. 
Security counter according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that 
the glass is multilayered and controllable in the translucency by the 

application of an electrical voltage to this layer and that, during or 
after the upward movement of the glass plates (5, 6, 7), such an 

electrical voltage is applied to the layer manually or under automatic 
control that the glass is opaque, but at least no visual contact exists 

between the operating person and the customer. 
Security counter according to claim 6, characterised thereby, that a 
switching-on equipment switches a current source off from the darkening 

layer on the rapid upward movement of the security plates so that the 
glass is opaque. 
Security counter according to claim 6, characterised thereby, that a 
switch or a setting device for the control of the transparency of the 

glass is arranged in the reach of the counter person. 
Security counter according to claim 6, 7 or 8, characterised 
thereby, that on the slow upward movement of the security plate, the 

layer controllable in transparency is acted on by a voltage from a 
current source in such a manner that the security glass remains 

translucent and visual contact exists between the persons in the counter 
space to be protected and persons in the customer space.  

 
Security counter according to claim 6, 7, 8 or 9, characterised 
thereby, that an alarm generator, which controls acoustic or optical 

signal generators or sends a raid signal to a control point, is coupled 
with the rapid upward movement and/or the switching-on equipment for the 

initiation of the production of an opaque wall. 
Security counter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the security glass (5, 6, 7) is fastened on 

a carrier plate (8), which is provided at about a right angle to the 
security glass (5, 6, 7) movable vertically upwards and underneath the 

security glass (5, 6, 7) displays a serving hatch cavity (9), through 
which money or goods can be passed when the security glass (5, 6, 7) is 

moved up, wherein the serving hatch cavity is constructed in known 
manner to be bulletproof, and that the carrier plate (8) closes the 

opening (19) in the counter when the security glass is moved upwards. 
Security counter according to one of the claims 6 to 11, 
characterised thereby, that the security glass (5, 6, 7) is divided, 

wherein the security glass consists of at least two panes which are 
arranged one displaced behind the other and the edges of which extend 

horizontally in the overlapping region so that a narrow gap for sound is 
formed between the overlapping panes. 
Security counter according to one of the claims 6 to 11,

at least three parts and has vertically displaced edges and consists of 
at least three individual security glass panes (5, 6, 7), wherein two

Security counter according to one of the preceding claims,

unframed construction - with the security plates to be moved upwardly or 
the security glass, are provided in the lateral guide walls. 
Security counter according to claim 15, characterised thereby, that 
the movement stroke of the slides is matched to the movement stroke of 

the security plate. 
Security counter according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that
