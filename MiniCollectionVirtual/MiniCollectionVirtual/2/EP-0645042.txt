<ABSTRACT>
A disk-shaped optical storage medium for binary information serially stored along a spiral track as pits and lands and readable by means of a laser beam according to the interference principle may be unmistakably marked in a counterfeit-proof manner by designing a selected number among the totality of lands as depressions in the optical reference surface, which are less deep than the pits. This marking, which may take any desired form, may be so small that it can only be made visible by electron microscope means or so large that it can be recognized by the naked eye under a mixed light.

A disc-shaped optical store for items of binary information
which are stored serially as a succession of pits (21) and lands (22)

along a spiral track (1 to 10) in a smooth optical reference surface,
wherein the mutually independent lengths of the pits (21) and the lands

(22) embody the stored binary values which can be read out by means of a
focussed track-following laser beam, in accordance with the interference

principle, characterised in that a selected number of the totality of
the lands is in the form of depressions (23) in the optical reference

surface, the depressions being shallow in comparison with the depth of
the pits (21).
A store according to claim 1 characterised in that the lands
(23) which occur in succession in the track direction and/or the lands

(23) which are adjacent in the radial direction and which are in the
form of depressions form a macroscopic pattern.
A store according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the lands (23) which are in the form of depressions are of a U-shaped

cross-sectional profile and are of a width approximately corresponding
to the width of the pits (21).
A store according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the lands in the form of depressions are of a V-shaped cross-sectional

profile and are of a smaller width than the pits.
A store according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the depth of the lands (23) in the form of depressions is less than 30%

of the depth of the pits (21).
A process for the production of a glass master for a disc-shaped
optical store according to one of claims 1 to 5 by track-wise

exposure of the photoresist layer of the glass master with a laser beam 
in the region of the pits (21) to be produced and subsequent development

of the glass master until the photoresist layer has depressions at the
exposed locations, characterised in that in the region of lands which

are to be in the form of depressions (23) in the optical reference
surface the intensity of the laser beam is reduced to a value which

within the storage surface required for reading-out of the store is a
maximum of 50% of the intensity value producing the pits (21) and which

outside that surface is between a technically meaningful minimum value
and 100% of the intensity value producing the pits (21).
