<ABSTRACT>
The brake control line (29) to the trailer is fed by a pressure trailer brake control valve (17) while the supply line (26) to the trailer has a switching valve (21) which switches between a full on setting and a restricted flow setting. A pressure control valve (20) feeds the switching valve. This isolates the trailer brake control system from changes in the pressure of the towing unit brake system. The pressure control valve reduces the towing unit brake pressure to a preset level. It is combined with the switching valve into one unit for simple fitting. The switching valve is connected between the control valve pressure and the trailer circuit pressure. If the trailer circuit pressure drops, e.g. if a leak occurs, then the switching valve sets to flow restriction and speeds the operation of failsafe trailer brake.

Control device for a service line (29) from the tractor-vehicle 
to the trailer on dual-circuit brake systems of 

commercial vehicles having a trailer-control valve (17), 
comprising a throttle valve (21) having at least one non-throttling 

position and one throttling position for an emergency 
line (25, 26) between the tractor-vehicle and the trailer and 

comprising a piston-like valve body (44) being under the action 
of the control pressure to the trailer-control valve (17) on its 

one surface and of the emergency pressure of the emergency line 
(26) after the throttle valve (21) on its other surface, 
wherein
 
a pressure-limiting valve (20) is positioned upstream to the 

throttle valve (21) in the pipe (22, 24) for the control 
pressure to the trailer-control valve (17). 
The control device of claim 1, 
wherein
 the pressure-limiting 
valve (20) is designed as a pressure reducing valve being 

adjustable to an absolute value. 
The control device of claim 1, 
wherein
 the pressure-limiting 
valve (20) is designed as a pressure reducing valve limiting the 

pressure with respect to the emergency pressure to the throttle 
valve (21) in the emergency line (26). 
The control device of claim 2 or 3, 
wherein
 the pressure-limiting 
valve (20) and the throttle valve (21) are 

constructively united and arranged in a common housing (57). 
The control device of claim 4, 
wherein
 the pressure-limiting 
valve (20) and the throttle valve (21) comprise a common valve 

body (44) the upstream surface of which is first under the 
action of the non-limited control pressure followed by the 

limited control pressure to the trailer-control valve (17).  
 
The control device of claim 4 or 5, 
wherein
 the common 
housing (57) is part of the housing of the trailer-control valve 

(17). 
The control device of claim 3, 4, 5 or 6, 
wherein
 the 
pressure-limiting valve (20) and the throttle valve (21) are 

mechanically coupled. 
The control device of claim 7, 
wherein
 the piston-like valve 
body (44) of the throttle valve (21) comprises a projection (35) 

to actuate a valve body (37, 59) of the pressure-limiting valve 
(20).
