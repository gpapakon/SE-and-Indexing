<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for producing high strength tubes (1), in particular barrels of shotguns and rifles. In order to reduce the number of work steps during manufacture it is proposed that a circular tube (1) as a blank is processed by means of a pressure roller method which is known per se, such that   a) a mandrel (2) of a pressure roller tool (3) is inserted into the circular tube (1), the external diameter of the mandrel (2) corresponding to the internal diameter of the desired finished tube, b) the circular tube (1) is compressed with known pressure rollers (4) with a special geometry, the thickness of the wall is reduced, the length increased and, at the same time, the outer contour of the tube (1) is produced, c) after pressure rolling, the outside diameter of the finished tube (1) is partially turned and the finished tube is cut to size.

Method for the manufacture of barrels of
smooth bore guns, with a round barrel (1) being

processed as rough part by means of a press-rolling
method in such a way that


a) a mandrel (2) of a press-rolling tool (3) with a
polished and smooth surface is pushed into the

round barrel (1), with the outer diameter of the

mandrel (2) corresponding to the inner diameter of
the desired finished barrel, and the mandrel (2)

having at its outer end a bevelling (5) which
corresponds to the "choke" at the opening of a

barrel of a smooth bore gun,
b) by means of press rollers (4) of specific
geometry, the round barrel (1) is compressed, the

wall thickness is reduced, the length is increased
and, in the process, the outer contour of the

barrel (1) is established, and
c) after the press-rolling the finished barrel (1) is
partially rotated and cut to length.
