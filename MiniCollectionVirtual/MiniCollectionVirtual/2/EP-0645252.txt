<ABSTRACT>
Described are methods and apparatuses for controlling the 
movement of a print head (15) in a printer for printing 

characters along a print pass while selectively reversing the 
moving direction of the printing head (15). In the printing 

head the character heights of a plurality of character series 
are checked, image data of a plurality of lines are read out, 

the image data being contained in a pass which can be printed 
within the height of the printing head (15), the readout 

image data is printed at once, it is checked whether or not 
the printed image data is continuous to the image data of the 

next pass, the same moving direction of the printing head is 
kept for printing the image of the next pass if it is 

continuous, and the moving direction of the printing head is 
reversed for printing the image of the next pass if it is not 

continuous. The methods and the apparatuses can print 
characters in excess of the height of the printing head in 

high quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for controlling the
movement of a printing head of a printer of the type which
prints characters while reciprocally moving the printing head.In a serial printer which prints characters while
moving the printing head along character lines, the print speed
is increased by using both the forward and backward movements
of the printing head. When this
bidirectional printing method is used to print an enlarged
character higher than the height of a printing head through a
plural number of scans by the printing head and at least one
vertical feed of a recording paper, which corresponds in length
to the print width, a printed image is discontinuous at the
boundary of the scan zone due to mechanical errors of the
printer. Accordingly, its image quality is poor.In printing such a character to be divided into
zones for printing, deterioration of the print quality is
prevented by moving the printing head in one direction (e.g.,
left to right) for printing.This type of the printer is disclosed in Unexamined
Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 61-57348. Fig. 11 is an illustration to provide an easy
understanding of the print control, viz., the movement of a
printing head and the paper feed control in such a conventional
printer. As shown, a series of enlarged characters "A B C" are
printed on the m-th line, and another series of characters of
the standard size "h i j k" are printed on the n-th line spaced
by a distance l from the m-th line.In a first step of the print control, a carriage
carrying the printing head is first moved in a direction (from
left to right). Through the movement of the carriage, the
upper half of the enlarged character series, "A B C", is
printed on a line. Then, the recording paper is fed by the
distance l. In a second step, the standard character series,
"h i j k", is printed. And the recording paper is fed by a
distance of (H - l).Subsequently, the lower half of the enlarged character
series, "A B C", is printed in the same direction (left to
right) as of the printing operation of the upper half.Thus, according to the print control in the
conventional printer, those characters to be divided into a
plurality of zones for their printing are printed
unidirectionally. Accordingly, the print control succeeds in
eliminating the problem of the discontinuity in the printed
characters, which arises from the different printing directions
of the printing head.In the print control disclosed in the Unexamined 
Japanese Patent Publication No.

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the movement of a printing head
(15) in a printer for printing characters along a print

pass while selectively reversing a moving direction of the
printing head, comprising the steps of:


previously determining the number of carriage movements of
the printing head (15) that are based on a first image

division method, wherein:

the region to be printed is divided into passes having
the height of the printing head,
printing the characters of the second line in a first
direction will be performed as the characters of the

first line are printed without changing the printing
direction of the printing head if the top of the

characters of the second line is present in the passes
from the uppermost pass to the first lowest pass, and
reversing the moving direction of the printing head for
continuing to print the characters of the second line

in a second direction opposite to the first direction
will be performed if the top of the characters of the

second line is absent in the passes from the uppermost
pass to the first lowest pass;
previously determining the number of carriage movements of
the printing head that are based on a second image division

method, wherein: 

it is checked whether or not any space is present
between two adjacent lines, and a print pass having a

width which is smaller than the height of the printing
head is set when the space is present,
printing the characters of the second line in a first
direction will be performed as the characters of the

first line are printed without changing the printing
direction of the printing head if the top of the

characters of the second line is present in the passes
from the uppermost pass to the first lowest pass, and
reversing the moving direction of the printing head for
continuing to print the characters of the second line

in a second direction opposite to the first direction
will be performed if the top of the characters of the

second line is absent in the passes from the uppermost
pass to the first lowest pass, and
determining which of the first and second image division
methods requires a less number of carriage movements, and

printing characters according to either the first image
division method or the second image division method thus

determined.
The method of claim 1, further comprising a step of
searching for a second lowest pass containing a bottom of

the characters of the second line if the top of the
character of the second line is present in the passes from

the uppermost pass to the first lowest pass, wherein the
printing step continues to print the characters of the

second line in the first direction until the second lowest
pass is reached.

head in a printer for printing characters along a print

pass while selectively reversing a moving direction of the
printing head, comprising:

are based on a first image division method, wherein:

the region to be printed is divided into passes having
the height of the printing head,
printing the characters of the second line in a first
direction will be performed as the characters of the

first line are printed without changing the printing
