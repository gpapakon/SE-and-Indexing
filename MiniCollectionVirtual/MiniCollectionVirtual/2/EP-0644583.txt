<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a refractory metal gate 
electrode includes forming a patterning mask layer that is 

dissolved by a solution including hydrogen ion and having a 
predetermined aperture on a semiconductor substrate, forming 

a gate metal layer having an ionization inclination larger 
than hydrogen on the entire surface on the patterning mask 

layer, forming a low resistance metal layer of a 
predetermined configuration having an ionization inclination 

smaller than hydrogen on the gate metal layer, covering at 
least an upper surface of the low resistance metal layer by 

a film which occurs no reductive reaction with the solution 
including hydrogen ion before or after patterning the gate 

metal layer, and removing the patterning mask layer using a 
solution including the hydrogen ion after patterning the 

gate metal layer. Therefore, a battery reaction of a system 
comprising the gate metal layer, the low resistance metal 

layer, and the solution including hydrogen ion can be 
suppressed by a film covering at least an upper surface of 

the low resistance metal layer, and localized abnormal 
melting at the gate metal layer occurring when removing the 

patterning mask layer using the solution including the 
hydrogen ion, can be suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a refractory metal gate electrode and, more particularly, to
a method for producing a high reliability gate electrode of
a high output FET employing compound semiconductor.Figure 7(a)-(b) show cross-sectional structures of a
GaAs MESFET having a T-shaped refractory metal gate
electrode of Au/TiN/WSi laminated layer structure produced
by a conventional process flow. In the figure, reference
numeral 1 designates a semi-insulating GaAs substrate on
which an n type GaAs active layer 2 having a gate recess 5
of a predetermined depth is formed. In the gate recess 5 a
Schottky junction type refractory metal gate 100 having a T-shaped
cross section is disposed, and a source electrode 3
and a drain electrode 4 are disposed on the n type GaAs
active layer 2 at the both sides of the gate recess 5.The refractory metal gate 100 is of a laminating layer
structure comprising a WSi film 8 100 nm (1000 Å) thick as a lower
layer including a stem part 8' of a T-shaped configuration,
a TiN film 9 as a gilding feeding layer, and an Au gilding
layer 11 400 nm (4000 Å) thick. The WSi film 8 and the Au gilding
layer 11 respectively serve as a Schottky metal layer and a
low resistance metal layer forming the Schottky junction 
type gate 100.The process flow for fabricating the refractory metal
gate electrode 100 will be described with reference to
figure 6.First of all, a gate recess 5 of a predetermined
thickness is formed at a position between the source
electrode 3 and the drain electrode 4 on the n type GaAs
active layer 2 (figure 6(a)), and a spacer film comprising
SiO 6 about 500 nm (5000 Å) thick is formed on the entire surface
(figure 6(b)).A photoresist (not shown) having an opening of a width
of about 0.4 µm corresponding to a gate length is formed on
the SiO spacer film 6, and a gate contact hole 7 of a depth
reaching the surface of the n type GaAs active layer 2 is
formed at a predetermined position of the SiO spacer film 6
corresponding to the center of the gate recess 5 by RIE
(Reactive Ion Etching) employing a gas including fluorine
(figure 6(c)), and, a WSi film 8 and a TiN film 9 are
successively grown on the entire surface of the SiO spacer
film 6 having the gate contact hole 7 by sputtering (figure
6(d)).A resist pattern 10 having an opening 10a of a
predetermined size is formed, and an Au gilding layer 11 is
formed through the opening 10a by performing an Au
electrolytic gilding employing the TiN film 9 as a gilding 
feeding layer (figure
