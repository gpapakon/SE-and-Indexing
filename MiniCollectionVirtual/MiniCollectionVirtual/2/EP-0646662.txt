<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning system for electrolytic tanks (1) consisting 
of a cell with a preferably rectangular layout, very long 

relative to its width, and which is provided with at 
least one conduit (8) with perforated walls, and preferably 

two, which run over the bottom of the cell, along its 
length, and ascend alongside the shorter walls until they 

reach, approximately, the level of liquid of the tank, 
said cell being provided below with surfaces which are 

inclined towards the perforated conduits, said conduits 
having sufficient cross-sectional area to act as guides 

through which are inserted a suction head and pipe for 
sludge extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tank for
electrolysis installations, in particular for
installations for the electrolytic production of non-ferrous
metals, such as zinc, copper, etc.Installations for the production of non-ferrous
metals by electrolysis comprise a series of identical
consecutive tanks separated by intermediate walls.
Generally, the tanks have a rectangular layout, very long
compared to the width, said width being determined by the
width of the plates which constitute the cathodes and the
anodes.During the process of electrolysis, sludges are
produced and deposited progressively partly on the anodes
and partly at the bottom of the tanks and have to be
removed periodically. In order to carry out the 
extraction of these sludges, the process of electrolysis
has to be stopped, with the resulting effect on the
productive process.Some of the most widely used current procedures for
extracting the sludges consist of using the main bridge
to withdraw some of the anodes and cathodes, thereby
creating an access opening, whilst others consist of
short-circuiting one or a series of tanks and then
removing the sludges, lifting the electrodes or not,
either via the upper part with a suction tube or from
below with a drainage tube at the bottom of the tank.Then, the operators insert a rigid suction tube and
sweep the bottom of the tank, thereby extracting the
sludges. The electrodes are put back into place. Another
opening is made a little further on and the process
continues. US-A-3 708 415 also covers an electro-refining cell having a series
of alternating anodic and cathodic frames through which an electrolyte is circulated at a
relatively rapid rate, the anodic frames containing current-distributing electrode rods of
impure metal and fragmented impure metal. Insulating and sealing means space the frames
apart and create a static zone beneath the frames and the main flow path so that anodic slimes
settle out of the electrolyte through screens forming the bottoms of the anodic frames. The
slimes are removed periodically from the static zone by dragging or by flushing the zone
with a flow of electrolyte.The object of the present invention is a tank
provided with means which enable the sludges to be
removed without having to interrupt the normal operating
process, such that it can be maintained continuously.The object of the present invention is an electrolysis installation comprising
(a) a tank for electrolysis including cells, each cell having a rectangular layout,
with a length, a width shorter
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrolysis installation comprising (a) a tank for electrolysis including
cells, each cell having a rectangular layout, with a length, a width shorter than the length,

and a depth, a closed bottom and side walls, and an open top having an upper edge, each cell
being provided along the upper edge of its longer walls with electrical outlets for the

electrodes as well as insulating supports for the electrodes, the tank comprising at least one
conduit with perforated walls in each cell, which conduit runs over the bottom of the cell,

along its length, and ascends alongside the shorter walls to reach a level for liquid within the
tank, the cell being provided below with surfaces which are inclined towards at least one

perforated conduit, the conduit having sufficient cross-sectional area to act as a guide for
insertion of a suction head and pipe for sludge extranction; and (b) a suction head and pipe

for sludge extraction adapted to be inserted into said conduit.
A method for cleaning an electrolysis installation, the installation composed
of a tank for containing electrolysis liquid, the tank having a bottom, having a length, and

sides, a suction pipe having a suction head for removal of sludge from the tank, and a
perforated conduit disposed inside the tank, down the sides and across the bottom thereof,

comprising the steps of: inserting the suction pipe and suction head into the perforated
conduit; creating a suction within the suction pipe; and extracting sludge from the tank

using the suction created in the suction pipe.
A method according to claim 2, in that the step of inserting the suction pipe
and suction head into the perforated conduit comprises extending the suction pipe and suction

head only along half the length of the bottom of the tank.
