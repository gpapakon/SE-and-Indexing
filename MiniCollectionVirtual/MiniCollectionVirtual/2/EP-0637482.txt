<ABSTRACT>
In a method of positioning a workpiece holder (1) in a machine, provision is made for the workpiece holder (1) to be put into and fixed in a position approximately corresponding to the desired position and for its initial position to then be determined with the aid of at least two reference marks (22, 23) made on the workpiece holder (1). The workpieces (50, 51, 52, 53, 54) clamped in the workpiece holder (1) are measured at a measuring location specially equipped for this. The measuring data thus determined are transmitted to the machine. The effective position of the workpieces (50, 51, 52, 53, 54) on the machine can then be calculated from the position of the reference marks (22, 23). Furthermore, a workpiece holder (1) is proposed which has at least two reference marks (22, 23), arranged at a horizontal distance from one another, for detecting its position in the X- and Y-direction as well as its angular position about the Z-axis. By such a method and a workpiece holder (1) designed according to the invention, the position of the workpiece holder (1) in the clamped state can be determined more accurately than hitherto. In addition, such a workpiece holder (1) embodied without conventional centring elements is considerably less expensive to manufacture.
