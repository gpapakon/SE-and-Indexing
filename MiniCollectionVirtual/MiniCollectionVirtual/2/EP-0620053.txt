<ABSTRACT>
A power unit for a conduit cleaner. The conduit cleaner has a motor with 
a housing carrying a shaft that is rotatable about an axis. The motor operates in 

response to the introduction of a pressurized fluid. The housing has inlets for 
admitting pressurized fluid and an outlet to permit the discharge thereof. A nozzle 

is connected to the housing and is configured to direct fluid from a pressurized 
supply to the housing inlet and direct fluid discharged from the outlet out of the 

power unit. The nozzle has a substantially cylindrical outer surface. In one form, 
the nozzle does not project beyond the cylindrical outer surface. Accordingly, a 

compact unit can be made according to the present invention. The absence of 
radially projecting structure also avoids protrusions that may intercept roots or 

other foreign matter within a conduit and thereby interrupt free movement of the 
conduit cleaner through a conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conduit cleaners and, more particularly, to a nozzle 
assembly that controllably directs fluid from a pressurized supply to a fluid 
operated motor and exhausts the same therefrom. Fluid operated conduit cleaners are well known in the prior art. Compact, 
commercially available, fluid operated motors, that can be incorporated into these 
conduit cleaners, are presently commercially available. Known conduit cleaners 
incorporate these motors in much the same manner as is done in the structure in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,740,785, to Latall. More particularly, a nozzle/thruster section, defining a pressure chamber 
and a plurality of circumferentially spaced jet orifices in communication therewith, 
is attached at the trailing end of the motor. In one known construction, the motor 
is modified by welding a nipple to the trailing end thereof, which facilitates 
threaded connection of the nozzle section to the motor. One particular problem with this construction is that, in addition to 
requiring multiple parts, a lengthy nozzle section is used which adds considerably 
and undesirably to the overall length of the conduit cleaner. This extended nozzle 
construction has the additional drawback that it, in conjunction with a multi-runner 
skid assembly, defines a captive space for foreign matter that may be encountered 
within a conduit, which foreign matter may inhibit or prohibit the withdrawal of 
the cleaner from a conduit. As can be seen in Latall, a substantial space exists  
 
between the nozzle section and a surrounding skid assembly, which space is readily 
penetrable by roots and other foreign matter. The interconnection of the pressure chamber on the nozzle and motor 
creates another problem in Latall. More specifically, the conduit which 
communicates between the pressure chamber and motor runs externally of the unit, 
which adds to the radial dimension thereof and introduces an additional structure 
which is prone to hangup in the conduit. The nozzle section in Latall includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced 
jet orifices which direct fluid from the pressure chamber radially outwardly and in 
a trailing direction to produce a propulsion force and additionally scour the conduit 
within which the cleaner resides. The orifices are bored directly through the body 
of the nozzle section. This construction has several drawbacks. First of all, each nozzle section has fixed flow characteristics by reason of 
the fixed diameter of the jet orifices. In the event that one wishes to
