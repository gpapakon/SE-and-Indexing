<ABSTRACT>
A monopolar electrosurgical instrument 60, 72 for 
utilization with endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical 

procedures. The instrument is structured so as to 
substantially eliminate the adverse effects occasioned by 

capacitive coupling between the instrument and tissue 
adjacent thereto within the body being operated upon. 

Capacitive coupling is controlled through the 
implementation of the shaft structure 10 itself with an 

electrically insulative polymeric material 4 of low 
dielectric constant which is combined with a current 

conductor 12 centrally disposed therein which is of 
minimum diamter effective to carry requisite current to a 

working tip. A shield arrangement may be provided such as 
a coextruded electrically conductive wire mesh 472 

surmounting the internally disposed electrical conductor. 
This shield, in one embodiment, may be coupled with return 

ground employing electrical connectors which assure proper 
coupling with source and ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
In "open" surgical procedures, the surgeon gains access to work inside the body by 
cutting large incisions through the body wall, then stretching the overlying tissue apart to 
provide visibility and room to manipulate his hands and instruments. Vital structures are 
generally held away from the surgical site and shielded from instruments by being covered with 
cloth pads. The surgeon can touch and manipulate the tissues. As the surgeon manipulates, 
cuts and dissects tissues, control is provided over the resultant bleeding by blotting or 
suctioning away the accumulating blood, enabling him to see the bleeding vessels and clamp 
and tie them off. The creation of a large opening in the patient's body tissue greatly increases the risk of 
surgery to the patient's health, by increasing the probability of complications. Those 
complications can arise not only from treatment of the target tissue, i.e., that tissue 
necessitating the surgery, but also from the trauma caused to adjacent tissue in creating an 
opening providing the surgeon with access to the target tissue. Once the internal tissue is 
operated upon, the surgeon faces the time-consuming task of closing up the surgical site. In 
addition, the patient may require extensive post-operative care and an extensive hospital stay. 
Development of the endoscope, a miniaturized television camera that inserted through either a 
puncture wound in the body wall or a natural orifice of the body to provide a video image of 
the inside of the body cavity, has enabled surgeons to perform surgery using specially 
designed surgical instruments that are inserted through small puncture wounds or body 
orifices. Some previously known devices have been constructed that enable a surgeon to 
operate on internal tissue while viewing manipulation of the instrument though an endoscope. 
One such device is described in Falk, U.S. Patent 4,994,024. Such previously known 
endoscopic instruments have several disadvantages, especially the inability to effectively stem 
blood flow incised tissue. Laparoscopic/endoscopic surgery avoids a large gaping incision through the body wall 
as called for in open surgery, and permits patients to undergo some major surgeries practically 
pain-free, with little or no post-operative hospital stay. However, in performing such surgery 
the surgeon foregoes manual access to the tissues being operated upon. In doing so, the 
traditional means of controlling bleeding by clamping and tying off transected blood vessels 
generally are not available.
