A method of presoldering a contact facing using a CuAg-base 
hard solder, by which the contact facing can be joined 

to a contact carrier, for which purpose the hard solder must 
be deposited as an even layer, preferably with a defined 

contour, for example by the use of a solder foil or the 
like, the deposited solder layer being melted-on,
 
characterised in that
 
in the melting-on the solder layer (13, 130) is covered by 

a material (1, 5, 15) which has no solubility with respect 
to silver (Ag) and copper (Cu). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that in 
the melting-on of the solder layer (13, 130) the material is 

in the form of a cover (1, 15) which is situated under the 
contact facing (10, 100) that is provided with the solder 

layer (13, 130) on its solder side. 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that in 
the melting-on the cover (1, 15) receives the solder layer 

(13, 130) on the one hand and the solder side of the contact 
facing (10, 100) on the other hand. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that in 
the melting-on of the solder the material is in the form of 

a cover (5) which is situated above the contact facing (10) 
that is provided with the solder layer (13) on its solder 

side.  
 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the material (1, 5, 15) for covering the 

solder layer is a refractory metal, for example tantalum 

(Ta), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) or mixtures thereof, and 
that a shaped body (1, 5) of the refractory metal, 

preferably of tantalum (Ta), is used. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the material for covering the solder 

layer is ceramic and that a shaped body (15), preferably a 
roll, of the ceramic is used. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the melting-on of the solder layer 

(13, 130) is performed by induction heating. 
A method according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the temperature-time curve (T = f(t)) is used to control the 

course of the process in the melting-on of the solder layer 
(13, 130). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the melting-on of the solder layer 

(13, 130) is performed by furnace heating. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the melting-on of the solder layer 

(13, 130) is performed under protective gas, preferably 
under inert gas or nitrogen.
