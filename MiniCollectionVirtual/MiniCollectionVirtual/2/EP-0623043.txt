<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing a first liquid such as paint from the recess of an article such as a multiparallel sided recess in a head of a fastener, comprises the steps of immersing the article in a second liquid which has a higher density than the first liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Method of removing liquid from a recess of an article.Description of InventionThis invention relates to a method of removing liquid from a recess of an article.Metal finishing processes are known which involve the dipping of an article in a bath of coating such as paint. To ensure an even coating of paint, it is common practice subsequently to spin the article to remove excess paint. However, where the article contains a recess, unless the article is carefully aligned during spinning with the recess facing outwardly, excess coating can remain in the recess. For economic reasons it is usual to coat and spin a plurality of articles together and it is uneconomic to align carefully each of the "articles for spinning. __ Where the article comprises for example a fastener having a threaded shank and a head, the head having a multi parallel-sided recess, it will be appreciated that any excess liquid in the recess which cures and hardens, can inhibit correct registration between an assembly tool and the fastener which can cause great problems in an automated assembly process.According to one aspect of the invention we provide a method of removing first liquid from a recess of an article comprising the step of immersing the article in a second liquid which has a higher density than the first liquid.It has been found that by simply immersing the article in the second more dense liquid, first liquid can be displaced from the recess by the second liquid.The second liquid may simply have a density significantly larger than the first liquid and/or the article may be immersed in the second liquid to a sufficient depth for the second liquid to exert a sufficient force to displace first liquid.By "significantly higher" density we mean at least three times denser, preferably at least five times denser, and more preferably at least ten times denser. 

 Where the first liquid is paint or another liquid coating which may have a density of around 1 gram per cubic centimetre one suitable significantly higher density liquid is mercury which has a density in the order of 13.5 grams per cubic centimetre. Because the mercury performs no chemical operation but only the mechanical operation of displacing first liquid, the mercury is not consumed in the method.The method may include immersing the article in the mercury or other significantly higher density second liquid to a depth of at least 50 cm, preferably at least 80 cm and more preferably at least 90 cm.Where the second liquid is denser but not significantly denser than

CLAIMS
1. A method of removing first liquid from a recess of an article comprising the step of immersing the article in a second liquid which has a higher density than the first liquid.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the second liquid has a density significantly higher than the density of the first liquid, by which we mean at least three times denser, preferably five times denser, and more preferably, at least ten times denser.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein the second liquid is mercury.
4. A method according to claim 3 wherein the article is immersed in the significantly higher density second liquid to a depth of at least 50 cm, preferably at least 80 cm and more preferably at least 90 cm.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein the second liquid is pressurised with the article immersed therein.
6. A method according to claim 5 wherein the second liquid is pressurised to a pressure of about two atmospheres.
7. A method according to claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the article is immersed in a bath of second liquid contained within a pressure vessel. 


8. A method according to claim 7 wherein the liquid in the pressure vessel is pressurised by introducing compressed air into the vessel above the liquid.
9. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein when the article is removed from the second liquid, the article is washed.
10. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein to assist the displacement of the first liquid by the second liquid when the article is immersed, the article is aligned with the recess opening generally upwardly.
11. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9 wherein to assist the displacement of the first liquid by the second liquid when the article is immersed therein, the orientation of the article is changed.
12. A method according to claim 11 wherein the article whilst immersed, is contained with a plurality of other articles in a cage, and the cage is at least partially agitated or at least reorientated.
13. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the first liquid comprises paint.
14. A method of removing first liquid from a recess of an article substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
15. A method of coating an article which has a recess, the method comprising the steps of applying coating to the article, and removing excess coating from the recess of the article by a method according to any one of the preceding claims. 


16. A method according to claim 15 which includes the step of spinning or otherwise agitating the coated article to remove excess paint from the article overall prior to immersing the article in the second liquid.
17. A method according to claim 15 or claim 16 wherein the coating is applied to the article by dipping or spraying.
18. A method according to any one of claims 15 to 17 which includes the step of applying an organic or inorganic surface coating to the article prior to applying final coating to the article.
19. A method according to claim 18 wherein zinc phosphate is applied to the article to prepare the metallic surface to receive coating comprising paint.
20. A method of coating an article which has a recess substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
