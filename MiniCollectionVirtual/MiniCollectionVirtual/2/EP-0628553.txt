<ABSTRACT>
A bubble column reactor is described which is characterised by a degree of slenderness as a ratio of height to diameter of 2 to 50, a feed for the ethylene glycol carbonate (EGC) or propylene glycol carbonate (PGC) already present and serving as reaction medium, at the lower end of the bubble column, one or more addition sites for the starting materials CO2 and ethylene oxide (EOX) or propylene oxide (POX) above the feed for the reaction medium, an outlet for the reaction mixture at the upper end of the bubble column, a divider attached thereto for the emerging reaction mixture for division into reaction mixture to be taken and worked up on the one hand and into reaction mixture to be recycled on the other hand and further a return line for the supply of the reaction mixture to be recycled. This bubble column reactor can be employed in an advantageous manner in a process for the continuous preparation of EGC or PGC, which is carried out in the temperature range from 100 to 200@C, in the pressure range from 5 to 200 bar and at a molar ratio of 1.01 to 1.5 mol of CO2 per mol of alkylene oxide in EGC or PGC which is already present as a reaction medium in an amount which is 7- to 350-fold the newly formed EGC or PGC.

Reactor for the continuous preparation of ethylene
glycol carbonate (EGC) or propylene glycol carbonate

(PGC) from CO
2
 and ethylene oxide (EOX) or propylene
oxide (POX), respectively, in EGC or PGC, already

present, as reaction medium in the form of a bubble
column, characterized by a) a slenderness ratio as

ratio of height to diameter of 2 to 80, preferably
2 to 50, particularly preferably 5 to 30, b) a feed,

at the bottom end of the bubble column, for the EGC
or PGC, already present serving as reaction medium,

c) one or more metering sites for the starting
materials CO
2
 and EOX or POX above the feed b), d)
an outlet for the reaction mixture at the top end of

the bubble column, e) a dividing device connected to
d) for the reaction mixture flowing off for dividing

it into reaction mixture (11) to be taken off and
worked up and reaction mixture (10) to be recycled

and f) a return line (10) and (3) to the feed b) for
the reaction mixture to be recycled.
Process for the continuous preparation of ethylene
glycol carbonate (EGC) or propylene glycol carbonate

(PGC) by reaction of ethylene oxide (EOX) or
propylene oxide (POX), respectively, with 1.01 to

1.5 mol, preferably 1.01 to 1.4 mol, particularly
preferably 1.01 to 1.35 mol, of CO
2

alkylene oxide in the temperature range from 100 to

200°C, preferably 100 to 190°C, particularly
preferably 110 to 180°C and in the pressure range

from 5 to 200 bar, preferably 5 to 80 bar, particularly 
preferably 8 to 60 bar in the EGC or PGC to

be formed as reaction medium in an amount which is
7 to 350 times that of the newly formed EGC or PGC,

characterized in that a bubble column reactor
according to Claim 1 is used for the reaction.
Reactor according to Claim 1, characterized by a
cascading structure.
Reactor according to Claim 1, characterized by
internals in the form of perforated trays, pipe

distributors, nozzles, two-component nozzles, jet
nozzles, closed gas distributors, impingement

aerator elements, mixer elements or a combination of
a plurality of these.
Reactor according to Claim 4, characterized by a
spacing between two sequentially following internals

of a value of 0.1 to 10 times, preferably 0.3 to

8 times that of the diameter of the bubble column,

permits a gas velocity of 0.1 to 15 m/s, preferably
0.2 to 12 m/s, and by diameters for boreholes in the

internals in the range from 0.2 to 20 mm, preferably
0.5 to 10 mm, particularly preferably 0.5 to 8 mm.
Reactor according to Claim 1, characterized by a

Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
an adiabatic procedure is carried out with a temperature

increase in the reaction mixture between 
inlet and outlet of 2 to 80°C.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in that
the adiabatically stored heat of reaction in the

reaction mixture is used to generate process steam

pure EGC or pure PGC, the reaction mixture cooling
