<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum alloy casting comprising 4.0 to 13.0% of Si, 
4.5% or below of Cu, 1.5% or below of Mg, and the rest of Al in 

weight ratio is produced by a production method which adds a 
metallic hydride to a molten aluminum alloy for casting at a 

temperature of liquidus line or above. This method makes the 
shape of pores generated in the casting circular and fine, and an 

average crystal grain diameter to be 1/3 or below of a thickness 
of the casting, thereby, an aluminum alloy casting having 

excellent airtightness can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aluminum alloy casting having 
excellent airtightness to be used as intake parts for 
automobiles, and to a method thereof. When aluminum alloy is melted to be cast as an aluminum 
alloy products, pores are often formed within a casting due to 
hydrogen gas or shrinkage. Where such a casting is used as parts 
such as passages or containers for gas, leakage might be caused 
through such parts due to communication of pores or shrinkage 
cavities within the casting. If defects within the casting, even 
if they are pores due to hydrogen gas or shrinkage, are present 
independently, leakage through such parts does not take place. Pores, which are formed within an aluminum alloy casting 
obtained by a common casting method such as gravity casting or 
low pressure casting, are present in grain boundaries 5 of 
crystal grains 1 as shown in Fig. 5. In addition, as shown in 
Fig. 5, pores are not circular and when the grain size is 
large, pores 3a and 3b are easily communicated. When an aluminum alloy casting having pores of the 
aforementioned shape is used for intake system parts for 
automobiles such as a manifold and a collector whose inside and 
outside pressures are different, intake air may leaks outside, 
resulting in the possibility of deteriorating engine performance. 
Therefore, various measures, e.g. a gassing treatment for 
removing hydrogen gas from the molten aluminum alloy, have been  
 
taken to prevent pores due to hydrogen gas from occurring . When casting is made from the degassed molten aluminum 
alloy, however, formation of non-circular pores is surely 
reduced, but shrinkage cavity occurs conversely in thick wall 
portions at a area where wall thickness varies largely. For 
example, when shrinkage cavity 10 occurs at boss 7 of a manifold 
or a collector as shown in Fig. 6, a tapping process to the boss 
7 communicates its interior and outside, resulting in the leakage 
of intake air outside. Therefore, conducting the gassing treatment to prevent the 
occurrence of pores due to hydrogen gas leads to another defect 
in the casting, and it is difficult to stably obtain an aluminum 
alloy casting having excellent airtightness. To remedy such a drawback, Japanese Patent Publication No. 
5-65573 discloses an aluminum alloy for casting which prevents 
the occurrence of shrinkage cavities due to impurities Fe and has 
excellent airtightness by adding 0.001 to 0.01 wt% of Ca to an 
Al-Si-Mg system or Al-Si-Mg-Cu system alloy. But, even if the shrinkage cavities are
