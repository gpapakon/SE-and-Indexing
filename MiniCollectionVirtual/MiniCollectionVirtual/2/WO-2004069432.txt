<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for sorting containers comprises a feeder device (1) for receiving containers in bulk and individual discharge of the containers in a feeding direction which is substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction of the containers. The apparatus also includes a rotation device (2) for rotating the containers about their longitudinal axes. A sensor unit (3) is provided for sensing a marking and a separator device is provided for transferring the containers to either of at least tow receptacles in response to the marking which was sensed. At least one additional sensor device is provided for sensing additional markings for identifying unauthorised containers. A sensor unit (3) for sensing a marking on a container includes a first sensor device for sensing a first type of marking and at least one additional sensor device for sensing additional types of marking.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SORTING APPARATUSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an apparatus for sorting containers, such as bottles, and comprising a feeder device for receiving the containers in bulk and for discharging them individually in sequence in a feeding direction which is substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction of the containers and at a first speed, a rotation device for rotating the containers substantially about their longitudinal axes, a sensor unit which is sited in the area of the rotation device for sensing a marking on the rotation of the containers, a separator device which is operable for transferring the containers to either of at least two receptacles in response to the contents of the marking sensed by the sensor unitBACKGROUND ARTThere is a multiplicity of types of feeding and sorting apparatuses for containers such as bottles or cans on deposit and recycling of them. For environmental reasons, it is vital to be able to recover and recycle as large a proportion as possible of those containers which are sold within a given region, normally a country.Even if the same rype of container is sold in many different countries, they are not. however, included in the same deposit and return system. 3 general, the deposit and return systems are nationally constructed and aά iαistered by, for example, retailers, beverage manufacturers or the manufacturers of the containers. When a product has been purchased by a consumer, .the consumer pays a minor sum of money for its package. When the contents have been consumed, the package is returned and the deposit is reclaimed. For this system to function in the long term, it is important that money be refunded only for such containers for which the consumer had previously paid a deposit. Granted, it could be possible for environmental reasons, to take care or recycle a bottle which is not included in any type of deposit and return system or which is included in the deposit and return system of a foreign country, but if this takes place on far too large a scale it will involve serious economic losses, since 

deposit is incorrectly refunded and since the management of an excessively large number of "foreign" bottles unnecessarily burdens the system.ϊn order to distinguish "foreign" containers, it has hitherto been the practice to read existing bar codes such as EAN codes. With the aid of these codes, a product can be identified and it may be ascertained whether the product belongs to the deposit and return system of a given country or not One

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An apparatus for sorting containers, such as bottles, and comprising a feeder device (1) for receiving the containers in bulk and for discharging them mdividually in sequence in a feeding direction which is substantially parallel with the longitudinal direction of the containers and at a first speed, a rotation device (2) for rotating the containers substantially about their longitodinal axes, a sensor unit (3) which is sited in the area of the rotation device (2) for sensing a marldng on the rotation of the containers, a separator device (4) which is operable for transferring the containers to either of at least two receptacles in response to the contents of the marking sensed by the sensor unit (3), characterised in that at least one additional sensor device is provided for sensing at least one additional marking or code on the container, whereby unauthorised containers are identified.
2. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the sensor devices include, in addition to a bar code reader, one or more of, for example, a CCD camera, an IR light reader, a UV light reader, a reader for holograms, a reader for water marks, a sensor of embossed relief patterns, an identification device for metals or the like.
3. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the sensor devices are integrated in the sensor unit (3).
4. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the sensor devices are disposed discrete and separate from one another,
5. The apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the rotation device is disposed to accelerate the containers to a second feeding speed which is faster than the first, whereby the containers, after the acceleration, assume positions a distance from each other.
6. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the separator device (4) includes a conveyor (5) which has a third speed which is equal to or faster than the second speed and along which the containers are transportable substantially 


in their longitudinal directions, there being d sposed, in association with the conveyor, an ejector (6) in order, in response the contents of the codes or other markings sensed by the sensor unit (3), to remove certain containers from the conveyor.
7. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the second speed is 2 to 3 times faster than the first speed.
S. The apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the rotation device (2) includes a second conveyor which has its direction of transport transversely directed in relation to the discharge direction of the containers out from the feeder device (1).
9- The apparatus as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that the second conveyor clines u ards in its direction of transport.
10. A sensor unit for sensing a marking on a container in sorting thereof, comprising a first sensor device for sensing a first type of marking, characterised in that at least one additional sensor device is included in the sensor unit (3) for sensing additional types of marking or codes.
1 The sensor unit as claimed in Claim 10, characterised in that the sensor devices included, consist of one or more of, for example, a bar code reader, a CCD camera, an TR light reader, a UV light reader, a reader for holograms, a sensor of embossed relief patterns, an identification device for metals or the like.
12. The sensor unit as claimed in Claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the sensor devices included are disposed in association with each other in a single unit (3).
13. The sensor unit as claimed in Claim 10 or 11, characterised ixi that the sensor unit is divided into at least two sub-units which are disposable in spaced apart relationship from each other.
