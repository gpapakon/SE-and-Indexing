<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to load handling apparatus comprising 
a telescopic boom according to the preamble of claim 1. 
Such an apparatus is known from FR-A-2200184. A similar apparatus is already known in which the telescopic boom 
has three sections. The first section carries the hydraulic unit 
and is adapted to carry the load receiving device; a hydraulic 
ram acts between the second and third sections; synchronising 
means extend and retract the first section in synchronism with 
the second section; and the third section is tiltably mounted on 
a vehicle. Using a fork as the load receiving device it is possible to 
unload containers up to 9 m long, by inserting the boom through 
one end of the container. However, longer containers (e.g. 12 m) 
raise the problem of achieving a telescopic boom which has a 
sufficiently long telescoping range. Increasing the length of 
the sections increases the retracted length of the boom. 
However, increasing the number of sections raises the problem of 
supplying hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic unit along the widely 
variable length of the telescopic boom. The present invention provides load handling apparatus as 
set forth in claim 1. Preferred and optional features are set 
forth in claims 2 et seq. The invention will be described, by way of example, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-  
 
Figure 1 is a side elevation of a vehicle equipped with load 
handling apparatus including a telescopic boom carrying a 
hydraulic unit for manipulating a load receiving device; Figure 2 is a diagram showing means for extending and 
retracting the boom; Figure 3 is a diagram showing means for supplying hydraulic 
fluid to the hydraulic unit for manipulating the load receiving 
device; Figure 4 is a diagram showing means for supplying hydraulic 
fluid to a ram for extending part of the boom; Figure 5 is a diagrammatic side view of the boom in a partly 
extended state; Figure 6 is a diagrammatic side view of the boom in a fully 
extended state; Figure 7 is a diagrammatic side elevation of the vehicle, 
showing various possible positions of the boom; and Figures 8 to 11 show parts of a preferred embodiment of the 
telescopic boom, in vertical cross-section, with certain items 
omitted for the sake of clarity. The vehicle 10 illustrated in Figure 1 has a telescopic boom 
11 which is tiltably mounted on a chassis frame 12 and can be 
raised and lowered about a pivot 13 by means of a hydraulic ram 
(not shown) connected between the boom 11 and the frame 12. At

Load handling apparatus comprising a telescopic boom 
having first to fourth sections (1-4) telescopically interengaged 

in sequence, a first hydraulic ram 
(29) extending longitudinally of the boom (11), being connected 

to the second and third sections (2,3), and being operable to 
move the second section (2) between a fully retracted position 

and a fully extended position relative to the third section (3), 
synchronising means (36-42) for moving the first section (1) 

between a fully retracted position and a fully extended position 
relative to the second section (2) in synchronism with the 

movement of the second section (2) relative to the third section, 
a second hydraulic ram (43) extending longitudinally of the boom 

(11), being connected to the third and fourth sections (3,4), and 
being operable to move the third section (3) between a fully 

retracted position and a fully extended position relative to the 
fourth section (4), characterized in that the first section (1) 

carrying a hydraulic unit (19) for manipulating a load receiving 
device, and in that a first rolling hose (51) communicating between 

the hydraulic unit (19) and a first connector (52) 
mounted on the third section (3), a second rolling hose (53) 

communicating between the first connector (52) and a second 
connector (54) mounted on the fourth section (4), and a third 

rolling hose (57) communicating between the first hydraulic ram 
(29) and a third connector (58) mounted on the fourth section 

(4).  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a 
load receiving device (16) tiltably mounted on the first section 

(1) of the boom (11) and linked to the hydraulic unit (19). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, in which the load 
receiving device (16) has wheels (27) which can contact the 

ground when the load receiving device is tilted to a 
predetermined position relative to the boom (11). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, in which the hydraulic 
unit (19) comprises a ram (21) mounted within the first section 

(1) of the boom (11) and connected to the load receiving device 
(16) via a lever (23) projecting from the first section (1). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a 
hydraulic control unit for supplying the first and second rams 

(29,43) in such a manner that the third section (3) of the boom 
(11) can only be extended relative to the fourth section (41) 

when the first and second sections (1,2) are in their fully 
extended positions. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the fourth 
section (4) of the boom (11) is pivotably mounted to allow 

elevation of the boom, means being provided to control the 
extension of the boom in relation to the elevation of the boom.
