<ABSTRACT>
This clamping device (5) is of the type comprising a spigot (pin) (6) which projects from the half-mould (2) and which is received in a cavity (17) in the platen, and a clamping mechanism (5) which includes a transverse ram (cylinder) (9) and a wedge (8) designed to interact with the spigot in order to ensure that the half-mould is detachably clamped. The clamping mechanism (5) comprises a bearing block (7) designed to be fixed to the entrance of the cavity (17) and including, on the one hand, a passage (25) for the spigot (6) and, on the other hand, a ramp (24) for bearing on the wedge (8), this ramp being provided on that face of the block which is facing the cavity in the platen. The spigot (6) is a body of revolution, with an enlarged head (14). Application to the injection moulding of plastics.

Device for clamping a mould half (2) onto
a plate (1) of a moulding press, of the type

comprising a pin (6) in the form of a solid of
revolution which projects from the mould half and

which is received in a recess (17) in the plate,
the pin comprising a widened head (14), and a

locking mechanism (5) comprising a transverse jack
(9), a wedge (8) adapted to co-operate with the

inner face (15) of the head (14) of the pin to
ensure the releasable clamping of the mould half,

and a support block (7) adapted to be secured to
the mouth of the recess (17) and comprising, on

the one hand, a passage (25) for the pin (6) and,
on the other hand, a support ramp (24) for the

wedge (8), characterised in that the ramp (24) is
provided on the face of the block facing the

recess (17) of the plate (1).
Device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the passage (25) of the

support block (7) is off-centre relative to the
block on the side of the latter which is nearest

to the central axis of the plate (1).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the wedge (8) is in the form 

of a fork which is open towards the central axis
of the plate (1).
Device according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the locking mechanism

(5) comprises a connecting rod (10) articulated on
one side to the piston rod (30) of the jack (9)

and on the other side to the wedge (8).
Device according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the locking mechanism

(5) comprises a connecting rod (10) which is
guided in translation and of which the end remote

from the jack (9) is slidably mounted in a slot
(29A) of the wedge (8) perpendicular to the axis

of the connecting rod.
Device according to any one of Claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the support block (7)

has a circular cross-section and fits in a mating
countersunk portion (18) of the plate (1).
Device according to any one of Claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the locking mechanism

(5) is contained entirely within the thickness of
the plate (1). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the piston rod (30) of

the jack, or a member that is linked thereto in
translation, comprises an indicator (31) which is

arranged outside the contour of the mould half (2)
and which is visible when observing the plate (1).
Moulding press, especially for the
injection moulding of a plastics material, of

which at least one plate (1) comprises at least
one clamping device (5) according to any one of

Claims 1 to 8.
