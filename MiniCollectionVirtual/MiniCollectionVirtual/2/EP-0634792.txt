<ABSTRACT>
A resin-sealed semiconductor device, including a chip 
mounting die pad (11), 

gold lead wires (14) and a sealing (13) containing porous 
fluororesin (15) and surrounding 

the other components, wherein any water vapor generated by the 
heat of soldering will be held within the porous fluororesin 

(15) rather than 
crack the sealant (13) under internal pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to resin-sealed semiconductor apparatus
and more specifically to preventing both the formation of cracks owing
to the thermal stress inside the resin and the formation of cracks in the
resin owing to water vapor pressure generated by rapid heating of the
resin during solder mounting of the device.Owing to the gradual miniaturization of electron instruments and to their
constant improvement in recent years, resin-sealed semiconductor
devices wherein semiconductor chips are sealed with a resin, such as a
epoxy resin, have become widely used as thin and compact semiconductor
packages and other devices of the surface-mounted type.Resin sealed conventional semiconductor devices generally have a semi-conductor
chip mounted on a chip-mounting component commonly
referred to as a die pad, the electrodes of the semiconductor chip and
the inner leads connected by thin gold wires, the components sealed with
an epoxy-based or other resin and subsequently connected to conductive
leads and coated with solder.Japanese provisionally published Patent Applications 61-23348 and
63-54757 show techniques for manufacturing such resin-sealed semiconductor
devices, including machining the undersurfaces of the tabs to
relieve stress. However, a serious disadvantage of conventional resin-sealed semiconductor
devices similar to that described above is their poor thennal
resistance during solder mounting of the package. Specifically, since
vapor phase reflow soldering or infrared heating are generally used as
the method for solder mounting of these semiconductor packages on
printed circuit boards (PCB) and the like, not only the components to be
joined by soldering but also the packages themselves are rapidly heated
during such solder mounting and the water which is absorbed in the bulk
of the resin and which has penetrated the semiconductor device during
storage rapidly evaporates owing to said heating. The vapor generated
diffuses along the interface either between the resin and the chip-mounting
component or between the resin and the semiconductor chip. The
components become detached from each other, and the vapor penetrates
between the detached portions, increases its internal pressure, and causes
cracks in the resin to form. Such crack formation becomes especially
noticeable in compact and thin semiconductor devices. A resin, such as
an epoxy resin, absorbs moisture during the period of storage which
follows manufacture but precedes soldering. With formation of cracks,
the resin-sealing effect is
