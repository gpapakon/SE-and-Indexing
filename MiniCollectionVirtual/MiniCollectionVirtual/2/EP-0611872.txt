<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In terms of the restoring forces which are to be produced and generate the sealing force in the closure position of the sash/leaf, the seal is not intended to be activated until shortly before the closure position of the sash/leaf. Furthermore, the stop web (8) is intended to run reliably into the seal (1), interaction of the stop web (8) and of the sealing lip (9) taking place, without a considerable restoring force of the seal, in the first part of the closing movement of the sash frame/leaf frame (7). 2.2 In order to achieve the object, the transition region between the sealing lip (9) and the leg (6) has increased elasticity due to a reduction in cross-section. The sealing lip (9) comes to butt against the leg (6) during the course of the closing movement, before the closure position of the sash/leaf, restoring forces which act on the stop web (8) being generated during the last part of the closing movement by the leg (6) and the abutting sealing lip (9). 2.3 The sealing profile is used for windows and doors.
