<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymer and shaped aramid 
and polybenzimidazole articles which exhibit an inherent water 
repellency and to a process for making such inherently water 
repellent aramid and polybenzimidazole articles. The articles 
include fibers; and the process for increasing the water 
repellency of the articles includes a reaction wherein 
fluoroalkyl groups are grafted onto the surface of the 
polymer. Japanese Publication (Kokai) No. 62-81426, published 
April 14, 1987 on the application of Asahi, discloses a 
process for treating aramid surfaces to render them more 
hydrophobic and decrease the coefficient of moisture 
absorption. The process includes: contact of the aramid 
surface by alkali metal hydrocarbyls or alkaline earth metal 
hydrocarbyls in no solvent or in a solvent specifically 
required to be less polar than dimethyl sulfoxide; and then 
contact of the metallated aramid by a halogenated aliphatic 
compound in no solvent or in a solvent specifically required 
to be less polar than dimethyl sulfoxide. There is no mention 
of the use of fluoroalkyl-containing alkylating agents. Japanese Patent No. Sho 62-91542, published April 
27, 1987 on the application of Asahi, discloses a process for 
treating aramid surfaces to render them more hydrophilic and 
increase the coefficient of moisture absorption. The process 
includes: contact of the aramid surface by alkali metal-containing 
or alkaline earth metal-containing compounds in a 
solvent specifically required to be at least as polar as 
dimethyl sulfoxide; and then, reacting the aramid surface with 
water or other polar compound. Japanese Publication (Kokai) No. 62-110,968, 
published May 22, 1987, discloses grafting materials to aramid  
 
fibers, through the use of epoxide-functional grafting agents, 
to create a surface with reactive epoxide groups. The present invention provides a process for 
increasing the water repellency of shaped aramid and 
polybenzimidazole articles comprising the steps of: contacting 
the articles with a solution of an alkyl sulfoxide solvent, a 
base whose conjugate acid has a pKa in the alkyl sulfoxide 
solvent of at least 19, and a lithium salt; maintaining the 
contact for a time sufficient to swell the surface of the 
articles and form anions on polymer molecules on the surface 
of the articles; optionally, rinsing the articles to remove 
the base and excess lithium salt; and, then, contacting the 
articles with a fluoroalkyl-containing alkylating agent such 
as a perfluoroalkyl benzyl halide
