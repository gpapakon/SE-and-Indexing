<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium playing apparatus which is 
capable of shortening the time required for operating the 

installation of recording media, and also, of 
accommodating a plur
ality of recording media in an 
accommodating section freely. A plurality of recording 

media are accommodated in an accommodating section 
together with a correlative position information 

recording medium which is recorded relation information 
related to the recorded contents of each of the plurality 

of recording media, and correlative position information 
indicating correlative positions of the plurality of 

recording media at the time of the accommodated 
condition, and then, the correlative position information 

and the relation information reproduced by playing means 
from the correlative position information recording 

medium are interrelatedly hold in a memory with respect 
to a plurality of recording media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
playing a recording medium, having a plurality of recording
media on which the sounds of musical performance and the
like are recorded and selectively playing a recording
medium from among the plurality of recording media. In particular, the invention relates to an apparatus of the kind as defined in the preamble of claim 1. An apparatus of this kind is disclosed in WO-A-86/01631.As an apparatus for playing a recording medium, there
is a karaoke reproducing apparatus. The karaoke
reproducing apparatus is accommodated with a plurality of
recording media on which sounds of karaoke music
(instrumental accompaniment) are recorded, and at a plying
mode, extracts a recording medium on which sound of a
selected piece of karaoke music is recorded, from the
plurality of the recording media, and plays the selected
piece of music. Also, there is a jukebox as an apparatus
having a structure similar to that of the karaoke
reproducing apparatus.In these recording medium playing apparatuses
including the karaoke reproducing apparatus, there is a
need for performing an operation of installation whenever
a recording medium is newly accommodated so as to store
information related to the contents of the recording medium
as well as the accommodating position thereof in a memory. 
The installation operation is carried out so as to execute
a quick-access to the portion where sound of a selected
piece of music is recorded on a recording medium which has
been chosen from a plurality of recording media. This
selection of a recording medium should be made immediately
after any one piece of music is selected.In the conventional apparatus for playing a recording
medium, when the installation operation is carried out- by
newly accommodating recording media, the recorded contents
of the accommodated recording media should be read every
recording medium. Inevitably, there is a problem that it
takes a time. In addition to this problem, the recording
media should be placed in a predetermined position in the
accommodating section arranged for each of the recording
media. Therefore, it lacks flexibility in placing them in
such a position.The above-referenced document WO-A-86/01631 discloses a video disk player
for reproducing a series of still pictures which are prerecorded on a plurality of
video disks contained in a removable magazine. Supported alongside the magazine
is an erasable, non-volatile memory for containing data related to the pictures.
When inserted into the player, the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for playing a recording medium comprising:

an accommodating section (2) for accommodating a plurality of packs
(25) each of which includes a plurality of recording media, on at least one (27) of

which relation information related to the recorded contents of each of said plurality
of recording media is stored;
memory means (18) for storing relation information related to the recorded
contents of each of all the recording media in said accommodating section,

and position information indicating the position of each of all the recording
media in said accommodating section; and
playing means (4a, 4b) for selectively playing a recording medium from
all the recording media in said accommodating section in accordance with an

instruction while referring to the stored contents of said memory means,

   characterized in that the at least one recording medium is a correlative
position information recording medium (27) for storing correlative position information

indicating corresponding relation between each of said plurality of recording
media and an arranged position of each of said plurality of recording

media in a pack (25) at the time of being accommodated, and

   said memory means (18) interrelatedly stores said correlative position
information and said relation information of said plurality of recording media

reproduced by said playing means (4a, 4b) from said correlative position information
recording medium (27) so that said playing means (4a, 4b) can select a

recording medium to be played in accordance with the stored contents of said
memory means (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of recording
media including at least one correlative position information recording

medium (27) are continuously accommodated as at least one group in said accommodating
section (2).
