<ABSTRACT>
Methylenebisthiocyanate and charged detergents, both biocidal, interact to form a complex; this interaction can be used in the assay of either. The complex can be dissociated with lauryl sulphate. Another assay comprises contacting an immobilised non-ionic hydrophobic material with the sample and with an agent that binds to the thus-insolubilised surfactant but not with the material, and then with an eluant for the agent, and determining the presence of the agent in the eluate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF ANALYSISField of the InventionThis invention relates to assays, in particular for compounds which can be converted to aldehydes and for surfactants.Background of the InventionThere appears to be no simple system for determining cationic surfactants in any field, although they are widely used in waste disposal, shampoos and, as biocides, in cooling towers. Examples of cationic surfactants that are used as biocides in cooling towers, in order to control organisms such as Legionella, are tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)- phosphoniu sulphate, tributyltetradecylphosphonium chloride, and (alkyl)quaternised dimethylbenzylammoniu chloride or dodecyldimethylammonium chloride (respectively available under the trade names Tolcide, Bellacide 350, Hyamine and Arquad 2-10/50) . It would be very desirable to monitor the level of such compounds in water, e.g. from cooling towers and also in cutting fluids, effluents and in the paper industry.Known biocides also include methylenebisthiocyanate (MBTC) . MBTC releases formaldehyde under alkaline conditions such as those that prevail in cooling towers. The Purpald reaction is clearly unsuitable for the pruposes of an assay, in these circumstances, since it cannot distinguish between MBTC and any free formaldehyde with which such a compound may be in equilibrium or with any formaldehyde from another source.WO-A-9115761 describes an assay in which MBTC or another aldehyde-releaser is distinguished from free aldehyde in an aqueous sample. The assay comprises: in first and second sub-samples, respectively converting the aldehyde-releaser to aldehyde and separating the aldehyde- releaser and aldehyde; and determining the difference between the respective amounts of aldehyde obtained. The amount of aldehyde obtained from the first sub-sample corresponds to the total amount of aldehyde-releaser and free aldehyde (which may include any aldehyde already 

 present in the sub-sample) . The amount of aldehyde obtained from the second sample corresponds to free aldehyde only, and the difference between the two amounts therefore corresponds to the amount of aldehyde-releaser. In O-9115761, the most preferred separation procedure, i.e. to separate the aldehyde-releaser and the aldehyde, comprises bringing the sample into contact with a suitably immobilised reagent, e.g. an anion-exchange resin which binds/retards the aldehyde-releaser. The bound species can subsequently be released by elution: for example, aqueous NaCl will serve to elute MBTC from an anion-exchange resin. The
