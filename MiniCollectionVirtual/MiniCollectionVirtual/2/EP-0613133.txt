<ABSTRACT>
A disc player comprises an arrangement (21) producing minimal noise and 
comprising a scanning device (37) for optically scanning an information carrier, a frame 

(23) carrying a loading device comprising a drawer (7), and a sub-frame (25) which 
carries the scanning device and is movable between two positions relative to the frame. 

The sub-frame is adapted to cooperate with the drawer for moving the sub-frame from 
one position to the other position. For guiding the sub-frame from one position to the 

other position there are provided pivotal elements (24a-24d), having one side movably 
connected to the frame and having the other side movably connected to the sub-frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for a disc player, in particular an 
optical or magneto-optical player, which arrangement comprises a scanning device for 
inscribing and/or reading an information carrier, which scanning device comprises a 
turntable, for supporting the information carrier, and a scanning unit with an objective, 
a frame carrying a loading device for the information carrier, which loading device 
comprises a drawer which is movable in a first direction and a second direction opposite 
to said first direction for moving the information carrier towards and away from the 
scanning device, a sub-frame which is supported by the frame and movable relative to 
the frame between a first position and a second position and which carries a the 
scanning device, the sub-frame being adapted to cooperate with the drawer for moving 
the sub-frame from one position to the other position, there being provided means for 
guiding the sub-frame from one position to the other position. A disc player comprising such an arrangement is known from EP-A 
0,397,262 (herewith incorporated by reference). The known disc player is intended for 
playing optical or magneto-optical discs and comprises a housing which accommodates 
an arrangement of the type defined in the opening paragraph. The arrangement has a 
frame carrying a loading device and sub-frame with a turntable. The loading device 
comprises a drawer which extends through a front opening in the housing and is 
movable between a slid-out position and a slid-in position. The scanning device, which 
is secured to the sub-frame in a resilient and damping manner, comprises a turntable 
and a scanning unit with an objective. A construction for guiding the sub-frame is 
arranged between the frame and the sub-frame. This guide construction has two guide 
elements which project laterally from the sub-frame and which bear on guide surfaces of 
the frame. During its movement from one position to the other position the drawer is 
temporarily in contact with the sub-frame in order to move the scanning device between 
a rest position and an operating position. The guide elements of the sub-frame then 
follow inclined portions of the guide surfaces of the frame. The construction has been  
 
dimensioned in such a manner that during the drawer movement the scanning device 
cannot come into contact with the drawer and an information carrier lying on the 
drawer, whereas in the operating position the turntable of the scanning device is 
disposed in such a plane that

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for a disc player, in particular an optical or magneto-optical 
player, which arrangement comprises 


a scanning device for inscribing and/or reading an information carrier, which 
scanning device comprises a turntable, for supporting the information carrier, 

and a scanning unit with an objective, 
a frame carrying a loading device for the information carrier, which loading 
device comprises a drawer which is movable in a first direction and a second 

direction opposite to said first direction for moving the information carrier 
towards and away from the scanning device, 
a sub-frame which is supported by the frame and movable relative to the frame 
between a first position and a second position and which carries a the scanning 

device, 
 
the sub-frame being adapted to cooperate with the drawer for moving the sub-frame 

from one position to the other position, there being provided means for guiding the sub-frame 
from one position to the other position, 

characterized in that 
the means for guiding the sub-frame, which carries the scanning device, from one 

position to the other position comprise pivotal elements which are each movably 
connected at one side to the frame and at another side to the sub-frame. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that, viewed in 
the directions of movement of the drawer, at least one of the pivotal elements is situated 

at each of two opposite sides of the sub-frame. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
pivotal elements are arranged in pairs at opposite sides of the frame. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the 
pivotal elements are connected to the frame and the sub-frame by means of hinges. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that pivotal 
elements which are situated after each other viewed in the directions of movement of 

the drawer have a different effective length and orientation. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, characterized in that 
there are provided additional means for guiding the sub-frame from one position to the 

other position, which additional means comprise at least one pair of guide elements, of 
 

which a first element has a guide slot oriented substantially in the directions of 
movement of the drawer and a second element comprises a guide pin which is 

engageable in the guide slot, one of the elements being connected to the frame and the 
other element being connected to the sub-frame. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that there are 
provided two pairs of guide elements, one pair of guide elements being situated near a 

front side and one pair of guide elements being situated near a rear of the sub-frame 
viewed in the first direction of movement of the drawer. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 6 or 7, characterized in that a 
bounding edge of the guide pin and/or a bounding edge of the guide slot is provided 

with a damping material. 
An arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the drawer comprises a first coupling element for cooperation with 

a second coupling element connected to the sub-frame, the coupling elements 
cooperating with one another in any intermediate position of the sub-frame situated 

between the first and the second position, and the coupling elements being firmly 
coupled to one another in the second position. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 9, characterized in that the first 
coupling element has an opening which is bounded by a coupling wall and the second 

coupling element is a projection adapted to cooperate with the coupling wall, the 
projection engaging the opening in the second position of the sub-frame. 
An arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the frame comprises a guide member which extends in the 

directions of movement of the drawer and which engages a guideway in the drawer, the 
guide member extending substantially over the entire frame viewed in the direction of 

movement of the drawer.
