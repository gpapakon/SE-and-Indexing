<ABSTRACT>
A single-chip microcomputer is constituted by a single-chip 
microcomputer core (4), an external bus interface circuit 

(1), an external bus, a logic circuit (3) and a bus interface 
(2). For asynchronously accessing to an exterior from 

the single-chip microcomputer core, the external bus interface 
circuit produces an asynchronous access control signal 

to the exterior based on an access control signal from the 
single-chip microcomputer core. The internal bus interconnects 

the single-chip microcomputer core and the external 
bus interface circuit, and the logic circuit is asynchronously 

accessible to and from the single-chip microcomputer 
core. The bus interface circuit is connected to the internal 

bus and produces an asynchronous access control signal 
to the logic circuit based on an access control signal 

inputted through the internal bus. Even when the user 
logic unit is designed with operating clocks independent 

from the operating clocks of the single-chip microcomputer, 
the function of the user logic unit is not bound by any 

significant limitations, and the number of steps involved 
in preparing the user logic test pattern is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a single-chip microcomputer, 
and more particularly to a single-chip microcomputer 
in which a circuit designed by a user is built in. A single-chip microcomputer has a wide field of applications. 
The user uses a standard single-chip microcomputer 
designed by makers. Recently, from the desire of users to distinguish 
their microcomputers from those of competitors, there is a 
demand for building-in users' own circuits in a single-chip 
microcomputer instead of using standard single-chip microcomputers. That is, as shown in Fig. 1, a single-chip microcomputer 
206 performs the desired operations with a CPU 201 
executing instructions read out from a memory unit 202 and 
controlling a peripheral function unit 203. Here, the CPU 
201, the memory unit 202 and the peripheral function unit 
203 are interconnected through an internal bus 205. A user logic unit 204 is equipped with an internal bus 
205 and an interface circuit (not illustrated) and is 
controlled by the CPU 201 through the internal bus 205.  
 
That is, the user logic unit 204 is configured so as to be 
handled in the same way as the peripheral function unit 
203. Whereas the CPU 201, the memory unit 202 and the 
peripheral function unit 203 are those designed by respective 
single-chip microcomputer makers, the user logic unit 
204 is one in which the circuit design is made by the user 
and which is supplied to the maker concerned. The maker of the single-chip microcomputer 206 mounts 
to such microcomputer 206 the user logic unit 204 supplied 
by the user and connects the user logic unit 204 to the 
internal bus 205. The aforementioned conventional single-chip microcomputer 
uses the internal bus to interconnect the CPU and the 
user logic unit. Generally, the internal bus is designed 
so as to be most suited to the internal controlling of the 
single-chip microcomputer. That is, the internal bus is synchronous with the CPU 
operation clocks and is arranged so as to operate at high 
speed and is constructed with complex timings. For example, 
the time as for set-up and hold of address data for a 
data read or write signal is very short. Since the user logic unit is designed by the user who 
has no knowledge of the operation within the single-chip 
microcomputer, it will be very difficult to design the user  
 
logic unit so as to match the internal bus timings. Also, since the user logic unit is presumably designed 
to synchronize with clocks which are unrelated to the 
operation clocks of the single-chip
