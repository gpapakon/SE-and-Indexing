<ABSTRACT>
A write protection device (10) prevents data from being written to selected portions of the hard disc of a computer. The write protection device is connected between the CPU of the computer and the controller for the hard drive. The write protection device monitors the read/write commands from the CPU to the controller. The address of each write command is compared with preselected address(es) stored in registers (12, 15) corresponding to the partition area and boot sector, and/or any other preselected address listed in a look-up table (160). In the event of a positive comparison, the write command is prevented from reaching the controller. Individual sectors of the disc can be write protected while still permitting writing to other sectors, even within the same cylinder. Low level format commands can be detected and disabled separately from write commands.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "COMPUTER MEMORY PROTECTION" THIS INVENTION relates to computer security. In particular, the invention is directed to a method and apparatus for preventing the unauthorised writing of data to selected portions of a memory device, such as a hard disc of a computer. The invention is particularly useful for preventing "virus" programmes becoming resident in a computer memory device.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION So-called "virus" computer programmes, or more simply "viruses", are unwanted programmes which are designed to interfere with the normal or intended operation of a computer. Although some viruses may only be mischievous in their operation, many viruses are written with malicious intent to cause serious damage, for example by destroying valuable data on a hard disc or otherwise rendering such data irretrievable. The damage caused by such computer viruses can be catastrophic.Any virus, regardless of its effect, is a threat to the security of a computer system. Significant costs and downtime are incurred in searching for, and eradicating, virus programmes which may have found their way into a computer memory, and replacing lost data and programmes. With the increasing prevalence and variety of virus programmes in recent years, viruses pose a serious threat to all computer systems, large or small.Various virus detection techniques have been proposed. Such techniques are normally software-based. Typically, an anti-virus programme attempts to detect the presence of a virus in a computer memory, such as a hard disc, by searching for a characteristic string of binary digits which identifies the virus. However, such software techniques are not effective for all known viruses. Further, some virus programmes are known to "mutate" and alter their characteristic string, thereby making such programmes virtually undetectable using conventional software techniques. 

 Another known anti-virus programme seeks to foil the intended operation of the virus by trapping interrupt commands. However, this known programme is not always effective against some viruses, and completely ineffective against others.U.S. patent no. 5,144,660 (and its equivalent Australian patent application no. 40095/89) describes a method of securing a computer against undesired write operations to, or read operations from, a hard disc of the computer in order to protect the computer against viruses. This method involves interposing logic circuitry between the disc controller and the read/write head(s) of the disc drive, decoding control signals

CLAIMS :
1. Apparatus for preventing the unwanted writing of data to selected portion(s) of a memory device of a computer having a CPU and a controller for the memory device, the apparatus comprising a write protection device having memory means containing the address(es) of selected portion(s) of the memory to which data is not intended to be written; decoding means for reading the address of any write command to the memory device; comparator means for comparing the write address with the address(es) of the selected portion(s) and disabling means responsive to the output of the comparator means for disabling the write command, characterised in that the write protection device is connected between the CPU and the controller. 2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the memory device is a hard disc drive.
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the addresses of the partition area and the boot sector of the hard disc are preset in the memory means. 4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the memory means further comprises a look-up table and the addresses of further portions of the hard disc which are to be write protected are stored in the look-up table.
5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the decoding means also detects any format command and provides an output to the disabling means to render the command ineffective.
6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the write protection device further comprises alarm means responsive to the comparator means for signalling an attempt to write to a write protected portion of the memory device. 


 7. Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein the alarm means is also triggered by the detection of a format command by the decoding means.
8. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising user-operated means for disabling the operation of the write protection device.
9. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the disabling means includes logic switch means for preventing the write command from reaching the controller.
10. A write protection circuit for use with a computer having a CPU, a memory, and controller means for the memory, the write protection circuit comprising means for disabling write commands to the controller means which are addressed to preselected portions of the memory, characterised in that the write protection circuit is adapted to be connected between the CPU and the controller means.
11. A write protection circuit as claimed in claim 10, comprising decoding means for reading the address of any write command from the CPU to the controller of the memory; comparator means for comparing the write address with stored address(es) corresponding to portion(s) of the memory intended to be write protected; and disabling means responsive to the output of the comparator means for disabling write commands addressed to the stored address(es).
12. A write protection circuit as claimed in claim 10 further comprising means for disabling format commands.
13. A method of preventing unwanted writing of data to selected portion(s) of a memory device of a computer having a CPU and a controller for the memory device, comprising the steps of (a) selecting the portion(s) of the memory device to which data is not intended to be written and storing the address(es) of the portion(s), 


 (b) reading the address of any write command from the CPU to the controller,
(c) comparing the write address with the stored address(es) of the preselected portion(s), and (d) disabling those write commands having an address corresponding to the preselected portion(s), characterised in that steps (b)-(d) are performed by a write protection device connected between the CPU and the controller. 14. A method as claimed in claim 13 further comprising the steps of detecting and disabling a format command to the controller.
