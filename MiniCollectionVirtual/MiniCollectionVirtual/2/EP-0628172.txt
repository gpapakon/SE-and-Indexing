Stabilization and channel-formation method for a 
multichannel sonar including at least one sea bottom 

surveillance system (3, 4) fixed on a carrier (2), the 
system (3, 4) furthermore including a transmitting 

antenna (3) insonifying a volume (5) of the sea bottom 
and used in the near field within the Fresnel region, 

and including a variable-aperture receiving antenna (4) 
forming adjoining channels i, characterized in that, in 

order to cover the sea bottom observed through a sequence 
of images of almost-adjoining observation regions (7) on 

the bottom, it consists in forming on reception a 
constant preset number N of channels i, having a variable 

spacing δ from one repetition to another dependent on the 
navigational parameters of the carrier (2) and in that, 

for each repetition, it consists in: 

within a first step (9), evaluating the movement 
L(n) of the bottom-observation region (7) for a 

current repetition (n) as a function of the movement and 
position of the carrier (2) relative to the observation 

region (7) between the previous transmission E(n-1) and 
the current transmission E(n), 
within a second step (10), determining the 
spacing δ
(n)
 between channels i for the current repetition 
(n) from the preset number N of channels i, from the 

movement L(n) evaluated in the first step (9) and from 
the spacing δ
(n-1)
 between channels i of the previous 
repetition (n-1), and 
within a third step (11), realigning in real 
time the direction of the reception axis with the 

direction of the transmission axis for the current  
 

repetition (n) and, on the basis of this direction, 
successively forming the N misaligned reception channels 

i of width δ
(n)
 so as to cover the field of the image of 
the current repetition (n). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the preset number N of channels i formed to cover 

the field of an image is chosen as a function of the 
desired resolution and of a "worst case" defined by the 

most unfavourable conditions of navigation of the carrier 
in a repetition period. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that it consists in expressing the spacing δ
(n)
 between 
channels i of the current repetition (n) as a function 

of the number N of channels i and of the movement L(n) 
through the formula 


δ
(n)
 = 
2K
N
 L(n) -Aδ
(n-1)
 
where K and A are constants such that K =  1+A / 2, so as to 

absorb the jerks by requiring that when the movement L(n) 
is kept constant during the successive repetitions, the 

spacing δ
(n)
 reverts to its initial value after a smallish 
number of repetitions. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that it consists in adding successively to the angle 


central axis
 of the direction of the transmission axis E(n), 
the angles 
i
 of the directions of the misaligned 
channels i numbered from 1 to N along the direction of 

travel of the carrier (2) so as to form the channels i 
covering the field of the image of the current repetition 

(n). 
Sonar for the implementation of the method 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 

that it includes two identical sea bottom observation 
systems (3, 4) which are symmetric with respect to the 

longitudinal axis of the carrier (2) each including a 
linear transmitting antenna (3) and a linear receiving 

antenna (4) of the same length and which are positioned  
 

on the same generatrix of the carrier (2), and in that it 
is coupled to a stabilization computer (8) located on 

board a ship (1) towing the carrier (2), the stabilization 
computer (8) forming on reception the number N of 

channels i, evaluating the movement L(n) of the bottom-observation 
region (7) for a current repetition (n) as a 

function of the movement and position of the carrier (2) 
relative to the observation region (7) between the 

previous transmission E(n-1) and the current transmission 
E(n), determining the spacing δ
(n)
 between channels i, 
realigning in real time the direction of the reception 

axis with the direction of the transmission axis, and 
successively forming the N misaligned reception channels 

i of width δ
(n)
