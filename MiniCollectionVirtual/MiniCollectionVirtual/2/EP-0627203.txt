<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic knee joint (10,12,13) is provided having 
an extended position (Figure 7), an intermediate position 

(Figure 8), and a flexed position (Figures 9 and 10). The 
motion of the joint includes a minor segment from the 

extended position to the intermediate position, and a major 
segment from the intermediate position to the flexed 

position. The center of pressure between the femoral 
component (10) and the tibial component (12) moves rearward 

on the tibia during the minor segment. During the major 
segment, the joint flexes about an axis of rotation (common 

center of radii R₃ and R₄) with the bearing surfaces 
(20c,20d,34c,34d) on the femoral (10) and tibial (12) 

components being in congruent engagement. The distal 
surface of the femoral component (10) includes two rails 

(88) for engagement with a patellar prosthesis (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved prosthetic joints and in 
particular to improved prosthetic knee joints. Flexion and extension of the normal human knee involves 
complex movements of three bones: the femur, the tibia, and the 
patella. During flexion, the distal end of the femur and the 
proximal end of the tibia rotate and glide relative to one 
another, with the center of rotation of the joint moving 
posteriorly over the condyles of the femur; during extension, the 
tibia and femur follow the reverse path, with the center of 
rotation now moving anteriorly as the joint is extended. 
Simultaneous with these movements of the femur and tibia, the 
patella moves over the surface of the femoral condyles, while 
remaining at a relatively constant distance from the tubercle of 
the tibia through the attachment of the patella to the tibia by 
the patellar ligament. Numerous prostheses have been proposed as replacements for 
the natural knee joint. See, for example, Noiles, U.S. Patents 
Nos. 3,996,624, 4,219,893, and 4,301,553, Averill, U.S. Patents 
Nos. 3,728,742 and 4,217,666, Insall, U.S. Patent No. 4,213,209, 
Tavernetti, U.S. Pat. No. 3,813,700, German Patent Publications 
Nos. 2,227,090 and 2,501,128, and French Patent Publications Nos. 
2,269,324 and 2,478,462. For total knee replacements, the 
condyles of the femur and the head of the tibia are surgically 
removed and replaced with prosthesis components. A patellar 
prosthesis, e.g., a spherically-domed or conical plastic button, 
is normally attached to the posterior surface of the patella to  
 
serve as an interface between the patella bone and the femoral 
prosthesis. Efforts have been made to produce prosthetic joints which 
function in a manner similar to the natural knee. Specifically, a 
number of mechanisms have been proposed for producing posterior 
movement of the femoral component relative to the tibial component 
(femoral roll-back on the tibia) as the joint is flexed. For 
example, Walker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,861, discloses a 
prosthetic knee joint wherein guiding surfaces on the femoral and 
tibial components are used to induce posterior movement on the 
tibial component of the contact area between the components as the 
knee is progressively flexed. The posterior movement takes place 
through a major portion of the flexion of the joint. Burstein et 
al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,298,992, shows an alternate construction in 
which the femoral component moves posteriorly relative to the 
tibial component at or near full flexion. See

A prosthetic joint for providing flexion motion between 
two bones comprising: 


(a) a convex bearing component (10) having a first bearing 
area (20b) and a contiguous second bearing area (20c), 

the second bearing area (20c) being a surface of 
revolution about a first axis and having a radius of 

curvature (R₃) which is less than the radius of 
curvature (R₂) off the first bearing area (20b); and 
(b) a concave bearing component (13) having a third bearing 
area (34b) for engagement with the first bearing area 

(20b) and a contiguous fourth baring area (34c) for 
engagement with the second bearing area (20c), the 

fourth bearing area (34c) being a surface of revolution 
about a second axis and having a radius of curvature 

(R₃) which is less than the radius of curvature of the 
third bearing area (34b); 
 
wherein: 

   the radius of curvature (R₃) of the second bearing area 
(20c) is substantially the same as the radius of curvature (R₃) 

of the fourth bearing area (34c) so that the second and fourth 
bearing areas (20c, 34c) may be in congruent engagement with 

one another; and 
   the flexion axis of the joint is parallel to the first 

and second axes when the second and fourth bearing areas (20c, 
34c) are in engagement. 
The prosthetic joint of Claim 1 wherein the area of 
contact between the convex and concave bearing components (10, 13) 

is greater when the second and fourth bearing areas (20c, 34c) are 
in engagement the when the first and third bearing areas (20b, 34b) 

are in engagement. 
The prosthetic joint of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the radius 
of curvature of the third bearing area (34b) is greater than the 

radius of curvature (R₂) of the first bearing area (20b). 
The prosthetic joint of Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the joint 
is a knee joint, the first component (10) is a femoral component, and 

the second component (13) is a tibial component.
