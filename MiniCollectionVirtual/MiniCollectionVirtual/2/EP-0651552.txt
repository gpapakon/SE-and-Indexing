<ABSTRACT>
A system for correcting registration errors in a printer (Fig.1). The system includes a 
memory device (82,82ยน) for storing sequential rasters of image data and an interpolator (60) 

coupled to the memory device, the interpolator using the rasters of image data from the 
memory device in conjunction with multiplication factors to calculate an interpolated 

resample value. The system also includes addressing circuitry (86,86ยน) for providing address 
signals (99,111) to the memory device, the addressing circuitry also providing the 

multiplication factors (XFRACT, YFRACT) to the two dimensional interpolator. Finally, included 
is a correction device for providing adjustment values to the addressing circuitry, the 

adjustment values being used to correct for the registration errors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for dynamically compensating for two-dimensional
registration errors according to the preamble of claim 1 for a hyperacuity printer.US 40 80 634 discloses a system similar to a system for dynamically compensating for
two-dimensional registration errors according to the preamble of claim 1.Registration of images layers is becoming more important as multi-layer imaging is
utilized for color printing. Mechanical means of registering layer information in the one to ten
micron region is very costly due to extremely tight mechanical tolerances which must be achieved.
Therefore, a need exists for a way to electronically correct for registration errors with subscan
precision instead of holding extremely tight mechanical tolerances.Up until now, for a polygon ROS imager, electronic registration correction has been only
possible in the fastscan direction because of the continuous convolution of the data stream with the
spot. Speeding up or slowing down the data clock to match the spot fastscan velocity has been
shown in US-A-4,766,560 to Curry et al. In the slowscan direction however, electronic registration
correction with subscan precision has been impossible because the scan structure in the slowscan
direction limited data transitions, or edges, to intervals of the scan pitch.However, with the advent of using variable intensity on the photoreceptor such as pulse
width modulation, limited subscan positioning precision has been made available for rendering
images. In addition, with the advent of overscanned imaging, or hyperacuity printing, US-A-5,138,339
to Curry et al., the gaussian spot used for printing is oversized and filters out the scan
structure. Hence, the application of gray output data to the photoreceptor has a better intensity to
edge placement response, and the image transitions in the slowscan direction can be corrected
electronically as well to produce slowscan positioning compensation with better subscan pitch
precision.US 43 81 547 discloses interpolation of density levels of magnification varied picture
elements.Therefore, together there is an opportunity to combine the fastscan compensation with
the use of hyperacuity printing to achieve two dimensional image registration error correction with
subscan precision. Furthermore, with the use of a resampling interpolator, precise resampled
image data value can be calculated with fractional precision to aid in the correction. This two
dimensional correction can correct errors from simple image phase shifting and
