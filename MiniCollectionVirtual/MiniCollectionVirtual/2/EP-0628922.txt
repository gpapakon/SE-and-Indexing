<ABSTRACT>
An image forming method in which digital image data are stored in a memory and 
are read out of the memory to form images on copy sheets in a first image orientation or 

in a second image orientation rotated through 180° with respect to the first image 
orientation. First image data relating to images to be formed in the first orientation are 

stored in the memory in ascending address sequence, starting from the first free 
memory address. Second image data relating to images to be formed in the second 

orientation, however, are stored in the memory in descending address sequence, 
starting from the last free memory address, while reading out from the memory is 

effected in ascending address sequence for both the first and the second image data. 
The available memory space is thus used without any capacity loss and hence extremely 

efficiently, because both the first and the second image data are stored in contiguous 
relationship and hence the memory space still available remains contiguous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image-forming method in which digital image data
representing image information from one or more documents, are stored in a memory
and are read out of the memory to form images on copy sheets in a first image
orientation or in a second image orientation rotated through 180° with respect to the first
orientation, first image data which relate to images to be formed on copy sheets in the
first image orientation being stored in the memory in ascending address sequence,
second image data which relate to images to be formed on copy sheets in the second
image orientation being stored in the memory in descending address sequence, and
reading out from the memory taking place in ascending address sequence for both the
first and the second image data. The invention also relates to an image recording device
for performing this image forming method.A method of this kind is known from US-A-4 453 841, in which copy sheets can be
provided with an image on the front and back. In these conditions, when processing
copy sheets so transported through the image forming device that the longest peripheral
side extends in the direction of transport, it is necessary that the image data for the front
or back should be rotated through 180° to ensure that the orientation of the image
information is the same on the front and back of the sheet. This is effected by reading
out of the memory in the reverse sequence the image data for that side of a copy sheet
whose image data have to be rotated through 180° or storing the same in the memory
already in the reverse sequence.The latter option is the most attractive because in that way reading out of the memory
for image forming purposes can always take place in the same direction irrespective of
the orientation.However, in storing image data which are to be stored in the memory in the reverse
sequence there is the problem that it is not possible efficiently to use the available
memory space.Since it is impossible to know beforehand how much memory space such image data
are to occupy, certainly if the image data are also to undergo compression, the option
chosen is to reserve a predetermined memory space which is ample enough on the
basis of the least favourable situation in respect of data compression.The object of the invention is to provide an image forming method in accordance with
the preamble in which effective use is made of the available memory space.This object is achieved in that the first image data are stored in the memory starting from
the first

<CLAIMS>
An image-forming method in which digital image data representing image
information from one or more documents, are stored in a memory and are read out of

the memory to form images on copy sheets in a first image orientation or in a second
image orientation rotated through 180° with respect to the first orientation, first image

data which relate to images to be formed on copy sheets in the first image orientation
being stored in the memory in ascending address sequence, second image data which

relate to images to be formed on copy sheets in the second image orientation being
stored in the memory in descending address sequence, and reading out from the

memory taking place in ascending address sequence for both the first and the second
image data,

characterised in that,

the first image data are stored in the memory starting from the first free memory address
and the second image data are stored in the memory starting from the last free memory

address.
An image recording device for performing the image forming method according
to claim 1, comprising means for generating digital image data representing image

information from one or more documents, a memory (52) for the storage of image data,
an image forming device (2) by means of which images can be formed on copy sheets in

a first image orientation or in a second image orientation rotated through 180° with
respect to the first image orientation, and control means (55) which so control the

memory (52) that first image data relating to images to be formed on copy sheets in the
first image orientation are stored in the memory (52) in ascending address sequence

starting from the first free memory address, that second image data relating to images to
be formed on copy sheets in the second image orientation are stored in the memory in

descending address sequence starting from the last free memory address, and that the
memory (52) is read out in ascending address sequence for both the first and the second

image data for the purpose of controlling the image forming device (2).
