<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit for reducing current flow through 
the UV light bulb (16;120) of a water purification unit 

when water is not flowing through the unit. In a first 
embodiment, the control circuit includes an RC shunt (22) 

selectively connected in parallel with the UV bulb, 
thereby selectively adding a positive impedance in 

parallel with the negative impedance of the bulb. In a 
second embodiment, the control circuit includes an 

impedance (152) selectively connected in series with the 
bulb ballast. In either embodiment, the impedance 

circuit is actuated in response to a water flow switch. 
When water is flowing through the unit, the impedance is 

removed so that full current is delivered to the bulb 
enhancing UV intensity. When water is not flowing 

through the unit, the impedance is added so that current 
flow is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water treatment
systems, and more particularly to a bulb intensity
control circuit for an ultraviolet household water
treatment system.Household water treatment systems are gaining
popularity, particularly in areas with less than ideal
potable water. One form of household unit is mounted on
a single tap to treat selectively water flowing through
the tap. Treatment may include filtration,
sterilization, or both.The most effective water treatment systems include
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation for sterilizing the water
stream. It is well known that such UV treatment kills
bacteria and viruses with an extremely high degree of
reliability. The water to be treated is typically routed
through a container, and a UV light source within or
adjacent to the container directs UV light through the
water stream.Two considerations factor into the intensity of the
UV light. First, it is desirable to operate the light at
optimum intensity to achieve the maximum "kill rate"
whether water is flowing or stagnated. Second, it is
desirable to avoid excessive UV light intensity to avoid
excessive warming of water "stagnated" within the
treatment chamber when water flow stops. Stagnation
occurs whenever the tap is not used for a considerable
period of time, for example, overnight. Prior artisans
have accommodated these considerations by selecting a
single optimum intensity of a constantly on bulb to
balance "kill rate" and temperature rise. The UV bulb is
always at optimum intensity, and the first water out of
the tap is properly treated. When water flow ceases, the 
optimum UV intensity prevents bacteria from recolonizing
in the treatment chamber. However, the temperature rise
of the stagnated water is undesirable.DE-A-3 739 966 discloses a circuit for a water purifying unit which selects the number of lamps in use according to the water flow, in order to vary the UV light intensity.DE-A-3 924 350 discloses a water purifying unit which turns off the UV light a predetermined time after the water flow detecting means indicate no more water flow.The aforementioned problems are overcome in the
present invention whose features are set out in the
accompanying claims. However, briefly, the intensity of
a UV light bulb is controlled by selectively introducing
an impedance, in addition to the ballast, into the bulb
circuit to selectively control the bulb intensity. When
water flow is detected, the additional impedance is
"removed" from the circuit so that the bulb operates at
optimum intensity to optimize
