<ABSTRACT>
Device for filtering positive de-stuffing jitter of a digital train, device including a phase-locked loop (15, 16, 17) making it possible to slave the rate of a signal representative of the rate of reading a buffer memory (12) in which the said digital train is written, de-stuffed, at the rate of a signal representing the rate of writing in this buffer memory, while carrying out low-pass-type filtering, device characterised in that it further includes means (1) called first means for determining the actual level of stuffing of the said digital train and to deduce therefrom the difference, called difference stuffing level, Td, between this actual level and a justification level known as nominal level, Tn, of this digital train, and means (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) called second means for:   - systematically suppressing the phase jumps, due to the positive de-stuffing, of the said signal representative of the rate of writing of the buffer memory, - regenerating phase jumps of this signal, corresponding in number to the said nominal stuffing level, - regenerating phase jumps of this signal, corresponding in number to the said difference stuffing level, and with smoothing of these phase jumps.

Device for filtering positive dejustification jitter of a digital bit stream, said device
including a phase-locked loop (15,16,17) for slaving the timing of a signal

representative of the read timing of a buffer memory (12) into which said
dejustified digital bit stream is written to the timing of a signal representative of

the write timing of said buffer memory, whilst applying low-pass filtering, which
device is characterized in that it further comprises first means (1) for determining

the actual justification rate of said digital bit stream and for deducing therefrom
the difference justification rate Td, i.e. the difference between said actual rate

and a nominal justification rate Tn of said digital bit stream, and second means
(2,4,5,6,7) for:


systematically eliminating phase shifts due to positive dejustification from
said signal representative of said buffer memory write timing,
regenerating phase shifts of said signal in numbers corresponding to said
nominal justification rate, and
regenerating phase shifts of said signal in numbers corresponding to said
difference justification rate and with smoothing of said phase shifts.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said second means include:

means (2) for applying to said signal representative of said buffer memory
write timing a time-delay obtained by superposing:


a sequence generated by a generator (5) of values -N where N is a positive
number denoting the amplitude of said phase shifts, the values of said sequence

being generated so that they are applied coincidentally with the pulses of said
signal which are affected by said phase shifts,
a sequence generated by a generator (6) of values +N, there being Tn.A
values in said sequence in each period 1/F, where F denotes the frequency at

which said actual justification and difference justification rates are determined
and A denotes the maximum number of phase shifts in a period,
sequences generated by a digital filter (7) of values varying progressively
from 0 to Td.A.N (with Td positive or negative), each of said sequences being

generated when a non-null difference justification rate is determined,
a nominal value No determined in such a way that the value resulting from
said superposition does not become negative in the case of consecutive negative

values Td,
means (20) for applying to the pulses of said signal representative of said 
buffer memory read timing a constant time-delay Mo such that Mo x TL = No x

TE where TL and TE respectively denote the period of the read timing signal and
the period of the write timing signal of said buffer memory.
Device according to claims 1 and 2 for filtering the dejustification jitter of a
digital bit stream formed using positive justification and positive-negat
ive
justification, characterized in that there are further provided:


time-delay means for applying to the pulses of the signal representative of
the buffer memory write timing a time-delay which, in the presence of a phase

shift due to positive-negative dejustification, becomes instantaneously, for the
pulse of said signal representative of said buffer memory write timing which is

affected by said phase shift, equal to + N' or to -N' according to whether said
phase shift has an amplitude equal to -N' or an amplitude equal to +N', where

N' denotes a positive number, and then, for a subsequent set of pulses, varies
progressively from +N' to 0 or from -N' to 0, respectively,
means controlled by a positive-negative justification indication signal to
determine the time-delay values to be applied to said time-delay means.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that said means for determining
said time-delay values include a digital filter which receives a positive-negative

justification indication signal offer it is converted to digital form.
Device according to claims 2 and 4, characterized in that said digital filters
comprise a single digital filter (7) which receives a signal from an adder (9)

receiving said difference justification rate indication signal offer it is converted to
digital form and said positive-negative justification indication signal after it is

converted to digital form, in that means are additionally provided for
superposing on said sequences a sequence of values + Td.A.N, each value of

said sequence being generated if a non-null difference justification rate is
determined.
