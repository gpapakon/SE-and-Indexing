<ABSTRACT>
The cutting process is executed after the grinding 
process and for one semiconductor ingot, one grinding device 

and one inner diameter saw slicing machine are used to 
perform grinding process and cutting process respectively. 

During the grinding process, the entirety of the cylindrical 
body portion of the semiconductor ingot is cylindrically 

ground, a portion of the tail end is cylindrically ground, 
the orientation flat position is determined and an 

orientation flat is formed by surface grinding. During the 
cutting process the 
tail portion is cut off and a sample for 
lifetime measurement is taken and a wafer sample is cut off 

from the end of the cylindrical body portion on the tail side. 
The semiconductor ingot is reversed in the direction of the 

axis and the head portion of the semiconductor ingot is cut 
off and a wafer sample is cut off from the cylindrical body 

portion on the head side. Wafer samples are cut off from the 
end of the cylindrical body portion on the head side and from 

the middle portion of cylindrical body portion to divide the 
cylindrical body portion into two blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
ingot machining method according to the preamble of claim 1.Fig. 7 shows the prior art grinding and cutting
method for semiconductor ingots 10.
(A) First, the semiconductor ingot 10 is mounted in
an outer diameter saw slicing machine with a blade thickness
of approximately 2500 µm. The two ends, i.e. the head
portion 12 and the tail portion 13 are separated from the
cylindrical body portion 11 of the semiconductor ingot 10 and
a sample 14 is cut off for lifetime measurement from the tail
portion 13 end. (B) Next, the cylindrical body portion 11 is
mounted in an inner diameter saw slicing machine with a blade
thickness of approximately 400 µm and wafer samples 21, 22,
23 and 24 are cut off from both ends and the middle section
of the cylindrical body portion 11 for crystal property
inspection. With this, the block 25 is formed between the
wafer samples 22 and 24, and the block 26 is formed between
the wafer samples 23 and 24.(C) The block 25 is mounted in a grinding device 
equipped with an azimuth reference positioning device that
irradiates the block 25 with x-rays while rotating it around
its axis to determine the azimuth reference position based
upon the peak intensity of the diffracted rays.(D) A grindstone is pressed down on the
circumference surface of the block 25 while it is being
rotated. The block 25A is obtained by cylindrically grinding
the block 25 by moving the grindstone parallel to the axis of
rotation of the block 25.(E) The block 25B is fixed at an appropriate
angular position in relation to the grinding device and by
moving the grindstone and grinding the block 25B parallel to
the axis of the block 25B, an orientation flat OF or a notch
not shown is formed at the azimuth reference position which
has been determined during the above step C. Steps C to E above are performed similarly for the
block 26.Since each of the blocks 25 and 26 must be aligned
and mounted in the grinding device, the azimuth reference
position must be determined, and cylindrical grinding and
surface grinding or notch grinding must be performed for each
block, the entire process becomes complex. Therefore, full
automation and systematization of such a procedure involves
complicated equipment and facilities. Also, as cutting must
be performed by placing the blade on the inclined faces at 
both ends of the semiconductor ingot 10 in step (A), it is
not possible to use an inner diameter saw slicing machine
with its higher cutting speed and thinner blade for if used,
