<ABSTRACT>
A cistern for a water closet or the like in which the device that initiates a flush or other discharge of liquid is connected to a handle (5) or other operating member by a mechanical linkage, and in which means (13) responsive to the liquid level within the cistern disconnect or otherwise disable the linkage so as to prevent a discharge unless the cistern is substantially full.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CISTERNS This invention relates to cisterns, of the kind comprising vessels which are adapted to be repeatedly filled with liquid to a predetermined high level, and then caused to discharge by the action of a human operator or automatic mechanism. It relates especially to cisterns for water closets and in particular, but not exclusively, to the kind of cistern described in Patent Specification GB-B-2205595. The discharge of water closets throughout the world accounts for huge quantities of water, and it is the common aim of water authorities in this country and elsewhere to promote the design and use of WC cisterns that flush efficiently and hygienically, but use the minimum amount of water in doing so. If a cistern can be caused to discharge before it is substantially full, the flush will tend to be inefficient, so wasting the water that has been used. The importance of ensuring a full flush is increased by current regulatory trends to restrict the volumes of WC cisterns. For example, from the beginning of 1993 the volume of all new cisterns in UK is to be 7.5 litres, compared with 9 litres as previously. Whereas 75% of 9 litres often sufficed to flush a pan clean, 75% of 7.5 litres would be less likely to suffice.Specification GB-B-2205595 describes means which help to prevent initiating a flush unless the cistern is substantially full. However, that method was closely linked to the particular type of cistern described in that specification, in which discharge was initiated by an operator squeezing an air bulb and so venting an air lock. Also, it was not proof against air being drawn into the system during flushing, thus impairing system efficiency.The present invention arises from appreciating the need for a device which prevents premature flushing more effectively, is less subject to the impairment of system efficiency just mentioned, and is both more robust, less capable of abuse, and 

 applicable to a wide range of cisterns. The invention is defined by the claims, the contents of which are to be read as included within the disclosure of this specification, and includes devices as described with reference to the accompanying simplified and diagrammatic drawings. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to those drawings, in which:- Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment; Figures 2 and 3 are perspective views of parts of another embodiment, in two different positions; Figure 4 is a section through part of a third embodiment;

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS I. A cistern for a water closet or the like, comprising a vessel adapted to be filled with liquid to a predetermined high level, an initiating device within the vessel to initiate a discharge of that liquid, an operating member for that device accessible from outside the vessel, and in which the operating member and initiating device are connected by a linkage including interconnecting mechanical members, and in which means responsive to the level of liquid within the vessel operate so as to disable the linkage unless the vessel is at least substantially full.
1. A cistern according to Claim 1 in which the disabling means are in the form of a float-operated gate operable to interrupt the linkage between the operating member and the initiating device. 3. A cistern according to Claim 2 in which the gate when operative physically prevents engagement between an adjacent pair of the mechanical members of the linkage.
4. A cistern according to Claim 3 in which the gate is associated with a float within the vessel. 5. A cistern according to Claim 4 in which the float also controls the valve through which liquid enters the vessel to fill it.
6. A cistern according to Claim 1 in which the initiating device is a flexible bulb and the linkage, when uninterrupted, squeezes that bulb when the operating member is actuated.
7. A cistern according to Claim 1 in which the means for disabling the linkage is a device of dashpot type, capable of transmitting substantial force when submerged and filled with liquid, but not so capable when the liquid level falls within the vessel, so leaving the dashpot above that level and allowing the liquid within it to drain out leaving air in its place.
8. A cistern according to Claim 5 including a syphon-type conduit to contain the liquid to be discharged, and in which the valve is fixed relative to the structure of that conduit. 


9. A cistern according to Claim 1 in which a float-operated first component, mounted on one of the interconnecting mechanical members of the linkage, is engageable with a second component mounted on another such member whereby to hold the linkage operative.
10. A cistern according to Claim 9 in which the first and second engageable components are a pivoted latch mounted on one of the linkage members, engageable with a recess on the other such member. 11. A cistern according to Claim 9 in which the two linkage members, associated with the inter-engaging components, are arranged to slide relative to each other.
12. A cistern according to Claim 11 in which one of the two said linkage members slides telescopically within the other. 13. A cistern according to Claim 9 in which the initiating device is the piston of a traditional bell-type syphon.
