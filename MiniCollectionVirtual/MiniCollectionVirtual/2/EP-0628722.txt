<ABSTRACT>
A compressor has a refrigerant gas passage (1b, 34, 37) 
selectively connected and disconnected with a refrigerant 

circuit (49) apart from the compressor. A swash plate (15) 
is supported on a drive shaft (15) for the integral rotation 

with the inclining motion in respect with the drive shaft (15) 
to drive pistons (22). The swash plate (15) is moveable 

between a maximum inclining angle and a minimum inclining 
angle. A disconnecting member (21) disconnects the 

refrigerant circuit (49) with the refrigerant gas passage (1b, 
34, 37) when the swash plate (15) is at the minimum inclining 

angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a swash plate type compressor 
that uses no electromagnetic clutch. A clutchless type compressor, as disclosed in Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-37378, does not use any 
electromagnetic clutch for either the transmission or cutting 
of power from an external driving source to the drive shaft 
of the compressor. The external driving source is coupled 
directly to the drive shaft. Not using a clutch or the direct connection between the 
driving source and drive shaft effectively eliminate shocks 
caused by the ON/OFF action of the clutch. This tends to 
improve the comfort level of the driver during the vehicle's 
operation. The clutch-less structure also contributes to a 
reduction in the overall weight and the cost of the cooling 
system.  
 In such a clutch-less system, the compressor runs even when 
no cooling is needed. With such type of compressors, it is 
important that when cooling is unnecessary, the discharge 
displacement be reduced as much as possible in order to 
prevent the evaporator from undergoing frosting. Likewise, 
under these conditions, it is also important to stop the 
circulation of a refrigerant gas through compressor, and its 
external refrigerant circuit. The compressor described in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 3-37378, for example, is designed to block the 
flow of gas into the compressor's suction chamber from the 
external refrigerant circuit by the use of an electromagnetic 
valve. This valve selectively allows for the circulation of 
the gas through the external refrigerant circuit and the 
compressor. When gas circulation is blocked the pressure in 
the suction chamber drops and the control valve responsive to 
that pressure opens fully. The full opening of the control 
valve allows the gas in the discharge chamber to flow into the 
crank chamber, which in turn raises the pressure inside the 
crank chamber. The gas in the crank chamber is then supplied 
to the suction chamber. Accordingly, a short circulation path 
is formed which passes through the cylinder bores, the 
discharge chamber, the crank chamber, the suction chamber and 
back to the cylinder bores. As the pressure in the suction chamber decreases, the suction  
 
pressure in the cylinder bores falls. Causing an increase in 
the difference between the pressure in the crank chamber and 
the suction pressure in the cylinder bores. This pressure 
differential in turn minimizes the inclination of the swash 
plate which reciprocates the pistons. As a
