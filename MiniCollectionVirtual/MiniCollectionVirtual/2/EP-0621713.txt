<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of media access control drivers are coupled to and 
provide a respective channel to connect a computer and the switched 

network. Each media access control driver has a first mode in which a 
connection is established in the switched network and a second mode in 

which the local area network protocol is passed over the switched 
network. The media access control drivers may also be placed in a third 

and fourth mode which allow communication in an unformatted and non-LAN 
based protocol. The architecture also includes at least one port 

connection manager which manages one of the channels when the respective 
media access control driver is in the first mode and a connection manager 

to manage a status of the connection. The media access control drivers 
are coupled to a protocol driver to send messages in the local area 

network protocol when the media access control drivers are in the second 
mode. Each of the media access control drivers include a table of 

parameters which describe the channel and a set of entry points to the 
channel. A protocol manager catalogs the tables for use by other 

modules.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to communication between a remote
workstation and a local area network over a switched network such as the
public switched telephone network (PSTN).It is becoming increasingly prevalent to couple large numbers of
computer systems into a network. The most typical network is called a
local area network as the computer systems are located within a limited
distance of each other and hard wired into a network, such as a Token
Ring or EtherNet. Many industry standards, IEEE and International
Standards, have been written for LAN architectures. The IEEE/ISO
architectures are particularly prominent and most local area network
applications and protocol drivers have been written for the
specification.A wide area network (WAN), which relies on the public switched
telephone network to allow connections from remote workstations to LANs,
is becoming more popular and cost effective for low usage connections to
permanently connected networks. However, most of the applications,
protocols, protocol drivers and other code modules of the LAN based
architectures are designed for the permanent type of connections, which
local area networks offer. It would be extremely advantageous to be able
to support existing LAN applications on a remote workstation connected
over the public switched telephone network using a typical X-series or V-series
modem."LAN Interconnect Using X.25 Network Services" by Barrett and
Wunderlich, p12-16, IEEE Network, September 91 describes interconnecting
LANs over a wide area using X.25 networks. Each LAN is attached to the
X.25 network by means of a gateway or router. "From a Distance: Dial-In
Comm Servers Look Smarter than Ever" by Greenfield, p57-63, Data
Communications International, March 1991, describes using a dial-up link
to attach to a LAN. This is achieved either by using the link to remotely
control a PC included in the LAN, or by extending the operating system of
the dial-in PC to allow applications to access remote LAN devices as if
they were locally attached.Thus attempts nave been made to provide remote workstations to a
LAN. In general, however, the prior art has relied on proprietary
hardware and software which is only marginally compatible with existing
LAN applications and standards. Typically, only a single protocol and
connection type can be sent between stations which may not be that to
which a desired LAN application is written. It would be preferable to
support the range of protocols and connection types used by existing 
applications. Further,

<CLAIMS>
A system for communicating over a switched network between a first
and a second computer using a local area network protocol comprising:


a media access control driver (66) in the first computer for
providing a communication channel to connect the first computer to the

switched network, and 
characterised by
 the media access control driver
having a first mode in which a connection is established over the switched

network and a second mode in which the local area network protocol is
passed between the first and second computers over the switched network.
A system as claimed in claim 1 which further comprises a port
connection manager (64) which manages the channel when the media access

control driver is in the first mode.
A system as claimed in claim 2 wherein the port connection manager
also switches the media access control driver between the first and second

modes.
A system as claimed in claim 2 or 3 which further comprises a
connection manager (62) to manage a status of the connection.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the media access
control driver includes a table of parameters (80) which describe the

channel and a set of entry points to the channel.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim which further comprises a
protocol driver (54) and a local area network application (58) resident in

the first computer which pass messages in the local area network protocol
to the second computer through the channel when the media access control
