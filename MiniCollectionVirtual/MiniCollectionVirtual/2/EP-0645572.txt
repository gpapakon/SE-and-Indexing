<ABSTRACT>
A spring clip (10) having two apertured end portions (12,14). In the 
preferred embodiment, the first end portion (14) has an unidirectional 

clutch (20) formed into the aperture wall, or face. The second end 
portion (12) provides an aperture wall (18) formed to provide an 

anti-rotation 
feature (16). In one embodiment, the clip (10) is used with fluid 

adapters, the second end portion (30) face having a serration (50) 
and shape 

which raises the serration above the parent material to mate with 
the serration (16) in the upper portion of the adapter lockring. The 

second end portion (14) has different shapes depending upon the spring 
clip (10) application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an inexpensive device for
preventing the loosening of coupling nuts on fluid lines.Fittings for providing a leak-proof attachment between a
hydraulic or other fluid conducting tube and associated hardware
such as actuators, manifolds, etc. are well known. Examples of
such fittings are disclosed in US-A-3,702,707.Various techniques have been proposed to fix the torquing
coupling nut, or B-nut, relative to the fitting so that the B-nut
does not back off the fitting. For example, a lockwire, passed
through holes formed in the B-nut and secured to a boss on the
parent material, is used in US-A-3,702,707 fittings to accomplish
this result.In EP-A-0 427 660 other
techniques for fixing the B-nut relative to the fitting are
disclosed. In particular, a separate sleeve having a shape
conforming to the outer configuration of the B-nut slides over the
B-nut down to the parent material so that the sleeve engages both
the B-nut and the lockring embedded in the parent material.The disadvantage of using a lockwire to fix the B-nut relative
to the fitting is that it is cumbersome and requires drilling a 
hole in one or more corners of the B-nut and finding a boss or tiedown
location on the parent material to keep the B-nut from backing
off. The lockwire is not a positive mechanical locking device and
installation of lockwires may be subject to inconsistent
techniques. The sleeve, and the various modifications thereto,
disclosed in EP-A-0 427 660 require retrofitting to
existing systems to be fully effective, such as modifications to
the B-nut.Four US patents developed during a patentability search,
US-A-3,329,190, 4,708,555 and 5,090,855 and
DE-A-2413760 all relate to lockwashers and are designed to prevent the
loss of locking torque in a conventional nut and bolt clamp-up.
US-A-1,066,761, also developed during the search, utilizes a
modified coil spring and two special clutches and requires a
special tool to disengage the coil spring from the clutch. These
devices are not designed for coupling components in fluid currents.US-A-5,058,930 discloses a high
pressure coupling and utilizes a cylindrical arrangement of spaced
fingers on a thin wall cylinder having protruding type directed
radially inward, the tips being accommodated in associated annular
grooves to prevent disconnection of the coupling component from the
associated fluid circuit. Although this coupling component is
designed to prevent disconnection as noted above, the complexity
thereof, the resultant higher costs and the lack

<CLAIMS>
A locking device for preventing first and second
joined parts from separating by rotation, comprising a

resilient U-shaped member, a first arm (12; 60; 70; 80) of
the member terminating in a shaped end portion to engage

said first joined part, a second arm (14) of said member
terminating in a shaped end portion to engage a

corresponding surface formed on said second joined part,
said shaped end portion in said first arm (12; 60; 70; 80)

being substantially coaligned with said shaped end portion
in said second arm (14), the shaped end portions being

formed to engage the joined parts such that the joined
parts will not rotate relative to each other, characterized

in that each of said end portions is formed with an
aperture (18; 62; 72; 82) therein to define an apertured

end portion and that the aperture in the second arm (14)
has a coined internal surface forming a unidirectional

clutch.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that a
serrated surface (16) is coined along the internal surface

of the aperture (18) formed in said apertured end portion
of said first arm (12).
The device of claim 2, characterized in that
said apertured end portion in said first arm (12) comprises

an upwardly inclined shaped member having a lower base
portion and an upper surface portion, the serrated surface

(16) of said aperture (18) being formed in said upper
surface portion.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that
said unidirectional clutch comprises horizontal faces (34)

retaining the second arm (14) beneath a surface of said
second joined part, vertical faces (36) preventing rotation

of said second joined part in a first direction and ramping
faces (38) allowing said second joined part to rotate in a

second direction.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that
said apertured end portion of said first arm (60, 80) 

includes a shaped tab (64, 66; 84, 86, 88, 90) formed below
the aperture.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the
internal surface of said aperture (72) formed in said

apertured end portion of said first arm (70) has a
hexagonal shape.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the
internal surface of the aperture in the apertured end

portion of the first arm forms a unidirectional clutch.
A fluid connector and lock combination for
connecting a tube to a parent material (30) , said

combination including a fitting (26) threaded into a parent
material (30) and including a passageway for passing fluid

and the combination characterized by comprising:

a lockring (50) having external serrations that
engages the parent material (30) and the fitting (26)

through mutual serrations to fix the fitting (26) relative
