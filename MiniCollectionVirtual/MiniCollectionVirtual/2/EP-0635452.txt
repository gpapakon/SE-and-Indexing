<ABSTRACT>
The capsule centering and applying device comprises: a 
carousel disk (11) which is rotated at constant speed and 

has multiple pans (12) for supporting the bottles to be 
processed, these pans being freely rotatable and mutually 

spaced about the disk with a preset angular pitch; at least 
one set of three processing heads (16-17-18) respectively 

for orientating the capsules, for forming the folds on the 
capsules, and for flattening the folds, these heads resting 

on a support (15) which performs vertical movements and 
reciprocating advancement and return angular translatory 

motions with strokes whose extent is equal to, or a multiple 
of, the spacing pitch of the pans (12); drive means (19-26) 

which are associated with the orientation head or heads to 
rotate each bottle, together with its capsule arranged on 

the pan (12); and optical reader means (29-30) which move 
rigidly with the head support (15) and are suitable to stop 

the motor of the respective orientation heads (16) when the 
reference mark (T) printed on the capsule is aligned with 

them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for centering 
and applying sealing capsules on bottles of wine, liquors 
and beverages in general, according to the preamble of claim 1. As is known, sealing capsules are fitted on the neck of 
bottles after bottling, said capsules concealing the cap and 
forming a seal that guarantees the contents of the bottle. Typically, these capsules are made of a heat-shrinking 
polymeric material or of aluminum and alloys thereof, and 
are applied to the bottle by making them adhere tightly to 
the neck of said bottles. In the case of capsules made of 
polymeric material, the heat-shrinking properties of the 
material are used to make the capsules adhere to the bottles 
by heating. In the case of metal capsules, the capsule is 
made to adhere to the neck of the bottle by forming 
longitudinal folds on the capsule and by pressing or 
flattening said folds onto the neck of said bottle. Since said capsules generally bear lettering and/or 
symbols and the like, in the latter case it is necessary to 
form the folds in the free spaces between one lettering or 
symbol and the next, so as to avoid concealing them. The 
bottle, on whose neck the capsule is placed, is thus pre-orientated 
with respect to a colored marking, known as 
"spot", which is pre-printed on said capsule, and is then 
sent to the stations for forming and flattening the folds. In conventional capsule applicators, the capsules are 
currently orientated and applied by means of a device which 
is provided with a carousel disk with a plurality of 
rotating and motorized pans for supporting the bottles and  
 
with a series of heads for forming and flattening the folds, 
which are suspended above said bottles. During the rotary 
motion of the carousel disk, each bottle, provided with the 
capsule to be applied, passes in the viewing field of an 
optical reader, typically a photoelectric cell, and the 
corresponding pan supporting the bottle is rotated until the 
reader reads the spot pre-printed on the capsule and stops 
the pan, consequently orientating the bottle to send it to 
the subsequent stations for forming and flattening the 
folds. Also known from EP-A-0052045 is a machine 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 for 
automatically capping and labelling bottles having a 
magazine for loading the caps, an endless conveyor chain for 
guiding the bottles, an Archimedean screw for controlling 
speed, and an endless conveyor chain for removing the 
bottles. The machine also has an inlet cross and an outlet

<CLAIMS>
Device (10) for centering and applying sealing 
capsules (C) on bottles (B) of wine and beverages in 

general, comprising a carousel disk (11) which is rotatable 
at constant speed and has multiple pans (12) for supporting 

the bottles to be processed, said pans being 
mutually spaced about the periphery of the 

disk with a preset angular pitch (p), at least one set of 
processing heads (17-18) 

being supported by a support (15) which performs vertical 
movements and reciprocating advancement and return angular 

translatory motions with strokes whose extent is equal to,  
 

or a multiple of, the spacing pitch of the pans, 
two of said heads being respectively for forming the folds on the 

capsules and for flattening the folds, characterized in that said 
supporting pans are freely rotatable, in that the or each set of 

processing heads includes a third processing head (16) for orientating 
the capsules prior to the forming and flattening the folds and in that 

drive means are 
(19-26) associated with the orientation head or heads to 

rotate each bottle, together with its capsule arranged on 
the pan (12) once that the orientation head has been applied 

on the bottle, said drive means consisting of an electric 
motor for each orientation head, and optical reader means 

(29-30) which move rigidly with the head support (15), said 
reader means being suitable to stop the motor of the 

respective orientation heads (16) when a reference mark (T) 
printed on the capsule is aligned with them. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it comprises a set of three pairs of processing heads 

(16,17,18) which are identical two by two, and in that each 
pair of heads performs, in succession, the respective 

operating steps for orientating the capsules, forming the  
 

folds, and flattening said folds on two bottles at the same
