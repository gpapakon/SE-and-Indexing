<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant composition for LSD of a car is here 
disclosed which is obtained by adding a phosphate amine 

salt such as an amine salt of an oleyl acid phosphate and a 
borated ashless dispersant such as a reaction product of 

polybutenylsuccinimide and boric acid to a base oil, a 
ratio (N/P) of a nitrogen content (N) to a phosphorus 

content (P) being 0.5 or more, a ratio (N/B) of the nitrogen 
content (N) to a boron content (B) being 4 to 10. The 

lubricant composition of the present invention inhibits the 
generation of chattering during the operation of an LSD 

device, minimizes the friction on a metallic friction 
plate, and is excellent in oxidation stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricant composition 
for a limited slip differential (LSD) of a car. 
More specifically, it relates to a lubricant composition 
for LSD which is excellent in oxidation stability and the 
prevention ability of the chattering (abnormal noise) of an 
LSD device incorporated in the differential of a car and 
which can be suitably applied to LSD of a studless tires-carrying 
car whose demand increases mainly in cold districts. In general, as an LSD device incorporated in the 
differential of a car, a wet multiplate clutch is used, and 
its differential controlling force is maintained by the 
frictional force of a metallic plate. A lubricant for this 
LSD is required to have extreme-pressure properties of a 
GL-5 class, and thus the lubricants containing a sulfurphosphorus 
additive and a friction modifier have been 
heretofore used. However, these lubricants are poor in frictional 
properties, so that abnormal noise which is called chattering 
is generated during the operation of differential 
gears, or a metallic friction plate is abraded in a short 
period of time. In consequence, it is often difficult to 
maintain the initial performance of the differential gears  
 
for a long period of time. Accordingly, it has been desired to develop a 
lubricating oil which is excellent in frictional properties 
and durability thereof and which minimizes the abrasion of 
a metallic friction plate. Under such circumstances, we, the present inventors, 
have intensively researched with the intention of 
developing a lubricant for LSD which inhibits the generation 
of chattering during the operation of differential 
gears, minimizes the friction of a metallic friction plate, 
and is excellent in oxidation stability. As a result, we have found that a lubricant composition 
having the desired characteristics can be obtained 
by adding a phosphate amine salt and a borated ashless 
dispersant to a base oil, and then adjusting a ratio between 
a nitrogen content and a phosphorus content and a 
ratio between a nitrogen content and a boron content. The 
present invention has been completed on the basis of such a 
knowledge. That is, the present invention is directed to a 
lubricant composition for LSD of a car which is obtained by 
adding a phosphate amine salt and a borated ashless dispersant 
to a base oil comprising a mineral oil and/or a synthetic 
oil, a ratio (N/P) of a nitrogen content (N) to a 
phosphorus content (P) in the composition being 0.5 or 
more, and a ratio (N/B) of the
