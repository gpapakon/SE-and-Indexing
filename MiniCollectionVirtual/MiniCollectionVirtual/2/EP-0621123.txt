<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing insulating board units from foam plastic for floor heating systems on intermediate floors, initial foamable polymer being introduced in the plastic state into a mould and, in a first foaming process step, foamed to form a first insulating board layer and, in a second foaming process step, foamed to form a second insulating board layer. The two insulating board layers are thereby bonded by foam interlocking. The foaming is set up in such a way that the upper insulating board layer in the installed state of the floor heating system has a density appropriate for the treading resistance of the insulating board units and the lower insulating board layer in the installed state of the floor heating system has a density which in comparison is less by a factor of 0.67 to 0.33, preferably by a factor of about 0.4.

<CLAIMS>
A floor heating system disposed on an intermediate
floor and embodying the following features:


1.1) the insulation overlay consists of insulating
panels with two insulating panel layers of

foam plastic, the said layers being
integrally connected by way of the foam,
1.2) the top insulating panel layer has a
thickness of 10 to 20 mm and a volumetric

weight of 25 to 35 kg/m
3
,
1.3) the bottom insulating panel layer has a
thickness of 30 to 45 mm and has a density

which is lower by a factor of 0.67 to 0.33
than the upper insulating panel layer,
1.4) plastic heating pipes lie on the upper
insulating panel layer and over them engage

U-shaped holders with limbs which are pushed
into the insulation overlay,
1.5) the limbs of the U-shaped holders have
elastically deformable barb elements at the

limb tips and also elastically deformable
barb elements which engage beneath the upper

insulating panel layer.
A floor heating system according to claim 1,
wherein the lower insulating panel layer has a

volumetric weight of 10 to 15 kg/m
3
, preferably about
12 kg/m
3
.
A floor heating system according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein an insulating panel has a dynamic stiffness to

DIN 18164 in the range from 10 to 30 mn/m
3
.
