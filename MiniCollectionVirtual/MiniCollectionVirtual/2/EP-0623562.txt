<ABSTRACT>
The plant for bending and quenching a glass sheet (1) includes a first series of shaping members (3) exhibiting a surface (3a) intended to come into contact with one of the faces of the glass sheet (1) and a second series of members (4) comprising a central surface portion (5) to which at least one moving part is secured (6,7). First means of control (10, 11, 12) make it possible to modify the profile of the surface (3a) of the first series of members (3), means (18) control the travel of the moving part (6, 7) of the second series of members (4) along a curve parallel to the profile of the surface (3a) of the first series of members (3) and second means of control are adapted to modify the profile of the central surface portion (5) of the second series of members (4).
