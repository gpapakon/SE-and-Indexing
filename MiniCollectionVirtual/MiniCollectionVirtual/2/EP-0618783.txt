<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of vasoocclusion
devices. More particularly, it relates to a
vasoocclusion coil which may be continuous or segmented,
onto which a fibrous, woven or braided, tubular covering
or element is attached.Vasoocclusion devices are surgical implements
that are placed within the vasculature of the human body,
typically via a catheter, to block the flow of blood
through the vessel making up that portion of the
vasculature or within an aneurysm stemming from the
vessel. One widely used vasoocclusive device is a
helical wire coil having windings that are dimensioned to
engage the walls of the vessels. Fibers may also be
woven or laid crosswise through the windings to provide a
substrate for clot formation and tissues growth within
the chosen site. Coils having such a structure are
readily commercially available.U.S. Patent Number 4,994,069, to Ritchart
et al., describes a vasoocclusive coil which assumes a
linear helical configuration when stretched, and a folded
convoluted configuration when relaxed. The coil is
introduced into the human body in a stretched condition.
When the coil reaches its intended site, the coil assumes 
its relaxed condition -- which is better suited to
occlude the vessel -- and restricts blood flow beyond the
space that it occupies.U.S. Patent Application Serial Number
07/771,013, to Chee et al., teaches a helical
vasoocclusion coil to which fibrous elements are attached
in such a way that they will not be dislodged from the
coil. The fibrous elements enhance the ability of the
coil to fill space within the vasculature and to
facilitate clot formation and tissue growth.Care must be taken in creating combination
fibrous coils, i.e., those containing metal coils and
fibrous elements, since the fibrous elements may come off
and move to vessels supplying blood to normal tissue.
Fibrous elements, since they are not normally radiopaque,
are difficult to find and to retrieve if separated from
the metallic coil. Nevertheless, it is desireable to
increase the ratio of fibrous element to the metallic
coil since the fibrous element increases the tendency at
the coil assembly to cause embolic and tissue growth. US-A-4 820 298 discloses a vasoocclusive device.
The helical
coil of the device serves as a skeleton from which
flexible monofilament strands are attached to join one
loop of the helix to another to close the space between
the spirals of the helix.FR-A-2 671 482 discloses an endovascular prosthesis
for maintaining the patency of a vessel following
angioplasty. The
