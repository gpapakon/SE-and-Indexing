<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system of input waiting queues provided particularly for being linked to the n inputs of an m-output switching matrix (MatCom). It includes a succession of n input circuits (CE1 to CEn) including m inputs (Ea1 to Eam), carrying, during each cell time, a series of availability signals (sd1 to sdm), each of which marks a state of availability of the output of the matrix (MatCom) for sending a cell at the cell time which is allocated to the said signal.
