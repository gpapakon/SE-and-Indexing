<ABSTRACT>
The spool (1) comprises tubular elements (8, 9) extending 
between heads (4 - 7) to define two half-spools (2, 3). Two 

of the heads (5, 7) are interconnected by a hinge such that 
the half-spools (2, 3) can be arranged linearly, for 

permitting an electric conductor to be continuously wound on 
the two half-spools (2, 3), and then positioned adjacent 

each other for permitting the wings of a U-shaped magnetic 
core to be inserted into the tubular elements (8, 9). One of 

the heads (5) has formed thereon a tab (19) and the adjacent 
head (7) has formed thereon a pocket (20), for spacing a 

bridging portion of the electric conductor which extends 
between the half-spools (2, 3) from the magnetic core. A 

raised portion (23) is also provided for impeding exit of 
the bridging portion of the electric conductor from the 

pocket (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved supporting 
spool for electric windings. As known, electric induction motors have a magnetic 
core, having associated therewith an electric winding 
through which an electric current flows. Small-size motors employ U-shaped magnetic cores and on 
each wing of the U-shaped core there is a separate spool on 
which an electric conductor is wound. Each spool is constituted by two substantially 
parallelepipedal facing heads which are connected, along a 
median axis, by a tubular element which also has a 
parallelepipedal configuration. In order to facilitate the operations involved in 
winding the electric conductor onto the spools and 
successive assembly of the spools on the U-shaped magnetic 
core, a spool has been provided which is constituted by two 
half-spools. Each of the wings of the core is to be inserted 
into one of the half-spools, which are made of plastic 
material and are interconnected by means of a hinge element, 
constituted by a strip which connects corresponding 
longitudinal perimetral edges of two of the heads. The presence of the hinge allows to align the two half-­
spools in the winding machine and therefore to wind the 
electric conductor more rapidly. In a first step, the required number of turns is in 
fact wound onto one of the half-spools and one subsequently 
continues winding on the adjacent element, forming by means 
of the conductor a continuous bridge at the pivoting region. After winding, the two half-spools can be easily and  
 
rapidly associated with the core of the motor by returning 
them to a side-by-side configuration. This is achieved by 
simply moving the ends of the spools remote from the hinge 
towards each other, causing respective rotation of the 
spools about the hinge. Though it constitutes a considerable technical 
improvement with respect to previous spools for small 
induction motors, said known spool is not devoid of 
disadvantages, not least of which is the fact that the 
bridge which connects the two windings is located too close 
to the cores, i.e. in a region in which considerable 
magnetic fields form during operation, i.e. when electric 
current flows through the conductor. This leads to the deposition of particles of iron or 
other metallic materials which may be produced through 
friction between metal parts or which may be present for 
other reasons. In fact, in the case of the installation of 
induction motors in household appliances such as washing 
machines, particular problems arise. In washing
