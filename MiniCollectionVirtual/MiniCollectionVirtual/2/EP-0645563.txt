valve body (3) having a fluid passage (4) therein to 

allow fluid to flow from one end port opening (6) to an 
opposite end port opening (7). The valve body (3) 

includes an annular sealing surface (8) cooperative with 
at least one of the end port openings (6, 7) with a 

valve stem (9) cooperatively aligned with such end port 
opening to open and close the same, the valve stem (9) 

having a collar (22) restrainedly fastened to such valve 
stem (9) to present an annular collar sealing surface 

(23) facingly cooperative with the annular sealing 
surface (8) on the valve body (3) to fluid seal the end 

port opening when the valve stem (9) is moved to a 
closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unique 
valve assembly structure and more particularly to a 
valve assembly structure for electrically actuated 
expansion valves for refrigeration systems in which 
there is constant incremental flow rate control. Electrically actuated expansion valves for 
controlling fluid flow in refrigerant systems are 
generally well known in the refrigeration art, attention 
being directed to the motor actuated expansion valve 
disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,986,085, issued to James 
C. Tischer on January 22, 1991 and to the solenoid 
actuated expansion valve disclosed in U.S. patent No. 
5,120,018, issued to John D. Lamb on June 9, 1992. These 
and other past fluid control valves, particularly those 
employed as expansion valves in fluid refrigeration 
systems, have presented flow control problems involving 
comparatively high friction seating with accompanying 
stem sticking, undesirable energy utilization, and 
frequent wear and replacement. Furthermore, inaccurate 
shut-off due to valve stem sticking, and high friction 
wear, as well as limited usage over large temperature 
ranges, have led to undesirable fluid leakages in many 
of the previous refrigerant systems with undesirable 
damages to other parts in the refrigerant systems - 
often necessitating frequent and costly parts 
replacement. The present invention recognizing the 
limitations of past valve assembly structures, provides 
a unique valve assembly structure which, although it has 
novel features readily usable with valve stems in a 
number of fluid control environments, is particularly 
usable with expansion valves for bi-flow heat pumps. The 
straightforward and economical valve structure of the 
present invention minimizes fluid leakage, reduces 
energy consuming torque and other energy requirements by 
providing low friction contact valve seating with 
minimal valve seat wear. At the same time, the novel  
 
structure of the present invention assures full closure 
of the valve stem with an optimum sealing surface and 
without undesirable valve sticking. The present 
invention further provides valve stem operation over a 
broad temperature range with minimal expansion 
contraction and without undesirable longitudinal 
movement or rotation of the unique, straightforward, yet 
critical valve stem parts included in the unique valve 
structure assembly. Various other features of the present 
invention will become obvious to one skilled in the art 
upon reading the disclosure set forth herein. More particularly the
