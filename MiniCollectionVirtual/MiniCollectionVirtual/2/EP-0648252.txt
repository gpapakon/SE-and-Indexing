<ABSTRACT>
A high quality lubricant for heavy duty service air conditioner and refrigerator compressors, especially those using chlorine free hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant working fluids, is provided by mixed esters of hindered polyols, most desirably di-pentaerythritol, usually mixed with some pentaerythritol, with a mixture of carboxylic acids including at least some of each of iso-pentanoic acid and iso-nonanoic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigerant working fluid
consisting essentially of a substantially chlorine-free,
fluoro group containing organic refrigerating heat transfer
fluid and a lubricant. The lubricants may be compounded
lubricants, which include at least one additive for such
purpose as improving high pressure and/or wear resistance,
corrosion inhibition, and the like along with the lubricant
base stocks which contribute the primary lubricity to the
compounded lubricants. The refrigerant working fluids
include lubricants along with primary heat transfer fluids
selected from chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing
organic refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as
pentafluoroethane, 1,1,-difluoroethane, 1,1,1,trifluoroethane,
and tetrafluoroethanes, most particularly, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
The lubricants and base stocks, in
combination with these heat transfer fluids, are
particularly suitable for lubricating compressors that
operate at least part of the time at temperatures
substantially higher than those at which humans can be
comfortable; such compressors are generally used, for
example, in vehicle air conditioning. Chlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for
use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the
atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the
currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat transfer
fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane.
The widespread commercial use of chlorine-free
refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been hindered,
however, by the lack of commercially adequate lubricants.
This is particularly true for one of the most desirable
working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, commonly known
in the art as "Refrigerant 134a" or simply "R134a". Other
fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desirable working fluids.Esters of hindered polyols, which are defined for
this purpose as organic molecules containing at least five
carbon atoms, at least 2 -OH groups, and no hydrogen atoms
on any carbon atom directly attached to a carbon atom bearing
an -OH group, have already been recognized in the art
as high quality lubricant basestocks for almost any type
of refrigeration machinery employing a fluorocarbon refrigerant,
particularly one free from chlorine. The following
patents and published patent applications also
teach many general classes and specific examples of polyol
esters useful as refrigerant lubricants with chlorine-free
fluoro group containing heat transfer fluids: US-A-4,851,
144; GB-A-2 216 541;
