<ABSTRACT>
According to the method of the invention, wafers (P) each formed of one or more semiconductor chips are equipped with conductors (F), wires for example, connected to the leads (PC) of the chips and turned towards the side faces of the stack, then the chips are stacked and coated in a material (40) capable of later being selectively removed; next the side faces of the stack are cut out so as to reveal the sections (C) of the previous conductors (F), connections (Cx), intended to electrically interconnect the sections of these conductors (F) are formed on the faces of the stack, then the coating material (40) is selectively removed.

Method for interconnecting wafers in three
dimensions, the wafers comprising one or more

semiconductor chips, the chips comprising pads for
their interconnection, the process being characterized

by the fact that it comprises the following steps in
succession:


connecting (11) leads (F, 36, 37) to the pads (P
c
) of
the wafers;
stacking (12) the wafers (P);
embedding (13) the stack by means of a selectively
removable material (40) ;
treating (14) the lateral faces of the stack in order
to make the leads flush with the lateral faces;
forming (15) connections (C
x
) on the lateral faces of
the stack, for interconnecting the leads;
removing (16) the embedding material.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that, during the first step (11), each of the

wafers (P) is arranged inside a frame (21) of
electrically insulating material, carrying conducting

depositions (22); that the leads (F) are connected
between the pads (P
c
) and the conducting depositions,
and that, during the fourth step (14), the lateral

faces of the stack are treated so as to eliminate the
frame.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that, during the first step (11), each of the

wafers (P) is arranged on a plate (23) of electrically
insulating material, the plate carrying conducting 

depositions (24), and chat the leads (F) are connected
between the pads (P
c
) and the conducting depositions.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that, during the first step, each of the

wafers (P) is arranged inside a frame (26) of
electrically insulating material, the frame carrying

conducting strips (27) extending (F) beyond the frame
so as to come above the pads (P
c
) and being connected
to the latter, and that, during the fourth step (14),

the lateral faces of the stack are treated so as to
eliminate the frame.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that, during the first step, the pads (P
c
) of
each of the wafers are covered with bumps (29), that an

electrically insulating substrate (30) is arranged
above the face of the wafer which carries the pads,

that the substrate carries metallic depositions (36,
37) on its upper and lower faces, which depositions are

linked to the bumps, and that, during the fourth step
(14), the lateral faces of the stack are treated so as

to make the metallic depositions flush.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized by
the fact that each of the wafers (P) further comprises

a second series of bumps (38) made on that one of its
faces which does not carry pads (P
c
), and that the
substrate (30) assigned to the neighbouring wafer

within the stack carries pads (39) intended to be
connected to the bumps of the second series.
Method according to one of Claims 5 or 6,
characterized by the fact that the substrates (30) each

comprise metallized half-holes (42, 43) made on their
lateral faces, where the connections (C
x
) of the stack
are made and intended to be in contact with them.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that, during the fifth step, grooves are

formed in the stack in accordance with the pattern of
the connections (C
x
), the grooves exposing the end of
the leads. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that spacers (41) are arranged between the

wafers during stacking.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized by the fact that it further

comprises a step (17) of coating the stack with an
electrically insulating layer of a mineral material.
Component comprising interconnected wafers, the
wafers comprising one or more semiconductor chips, the

chips comprising pads (P

comprises a plurality of stacked wafers (P), leads (F,
36, 37) connected to the pads (P
c
) of the wafers and
extending to the lateral faces of the stack until they

are flush with these lateral faces, and connections
(C
x
) directly connected to the leads, arranged on the
lateral faces of the stack, the connections forming a

mechanical support for the wafers, the component
comprising no embedding for the wafers.
