<ABSTRACT>
An appropriate handoff trigger is determined in a 
cellular system by maintaining both a long term 

representation of the received signal strength and a 
short term measurement of the current signal strength. 

The long term representation is used as the initial 
trigger for a handoff condition. The averaging process 

removes the effects of short term fades in the signal 
that may cause a premature handoff decision due to these 

fluctuations. This initial trigger is then qualified by 
examining the short term current, value of the signal. 

The actual handoff trigger is only realized when both 
values indicate that the handoff threshold has been 

exceeded. This approach eliminates the occurrence of 
false handoff triggers caused by the historical bias that 

may exist from the long term averaging process. The 
short term signal strengths value is reported as the 

mobile station's signal for comparisons to the signal 
strength measured on the adjacent cells. Since this 

value represents the current measure of the signal, it 
provides a truer comparison with the current measurements 

made on the adjacent cells, and virtually eliminates 
delayed handoff realizations due to the long term average 

historical bias.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method and
apparatus for determining and executing correct handoff
decisions in a cellular system. Specifically, the
invention involves determining the correct handoff time
(decisions) based on both a long term and short term
measurement of the signal level.Correct handoff decisions are a prime requirement for
a successful cellular system. The ability to detect the
need to handoff a cellular call from one base station to
another at the appropriate coverage point is essential in
maintaining both the integrity of the frequency plan
defined by the cellular operator, as well as the mobile
subscriber's call quality.The ability of the base station, also called a land
station, to correctly measure the received signal
strength of the mobile station is the core building block
of this system requirement. The land station must
provide a precise and consistent measure of the mobile
station's signal strength. The land station must react
appropriately to changes in the signal, without
overreacting to signal fluctuations prevalent in radio
signals due to fading conditions. Overreacting to
fluctuating signals can have as detrimental an impact to
proper frequency containment as not being sufficiently
reactive to true handoff conditions.Single stage methods to determine handoff conditions
include approaches that rely exclusively on short term
measurements and approaches that rely exclusively on long
term averaging of the signal over predetermined 
measurement intervals. However, such single stage
methods for measuring a mobile station's signal strength
for handoff detection purposes are deficient in several
ways.Methods that rely exclusively on short term
measurements are subject to error due to the highly
fluctuating nature of the signal. These methods rely on
periodic sampling of the signal at intervals of several
seconds to many seconds. This practice contributes to
poor handoff detections due to the long latencies that
may exist between measurements. In effect, this method
may make premature decisions due to the effects of short
fades on the signal. Additionally, this method may not
be sufficiently reactive to a true handoff condition due
to the large latency that exists between measurements.Long term averaging methods, which utilize continual
measurements at relatively frequent intervals and then
average them over a period of time, provide a more even
view of the mobile station's signal. Long term averaging
smooths out the effects of short term fades in the
signal. Long term

A method of correctly determining, in a cellular system, when a phone call on
a mobile station on a particular voice channel in one cell site should be handed off to

a voice channel in another cell site, characterised in that the method comprises the
steps of:


(a) sampling (190) signals received from said mobile station to determine
a signal strength of said received signals at predetermined intervals and outputting a

received signal strength indication (RSSI) sample at said predetermined intervals;
(b) calculating (150) a long term average of said samples at said
predetermined intervals once a predetermined number of said samples have been

received;
(c) calculating (150) a short term average of said samples;
(d) comparing (160) said long term average to a predetermined threshold
value;
(e) comparing (170) said short term average to said threshold value if said
long term average is below said threshold value; and
(f) determining (180) that said handoff condition exists if both said long
term and short term averages are below said threshold value.
A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising the step of:

   sending a handoff request (180) to a controller after determining that a handoff
condition exists, said handoff request including said second signal value for

comparison to adjacent cell site signal strength levels.

is averaged is longer than a time period over which said second signal is averaged.
The method of claim 1 wherein a time period over which said second signal
value is averaged is correlated to a time period over which a signal strength value is

measured by locate/receive devices of adjacent cells.
