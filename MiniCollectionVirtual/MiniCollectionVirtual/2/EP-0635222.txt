<ABSTRACT>
An improved comb comprises a spine (10) and a plurality of line 
members (20). The spine (10) further consists of a left member (11) and 

a right member (12) fixing to each other. The plurality of line members 
(20) are connected between the left member (11) and the right member 

(12) with an indentation being located at the intermediate portion of 

each line member. Each line member (20) is then bent at the indentation 
to form an approximate elliptical loop and acts as a tooth of the comb 

for tidying the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an improved comb. It is found that the prior art combs are unsatisfactory in use and 
have the following drawbacks: 
1. The teeth are too hard and may hurt the scalp in use. 2. Such combs may pull the hair in use. 3. The tips of such combs are made of chemical substance which is 
toxic and may cause harmful side effects to the user. Therefore, it is a main purpose of the present invention to obviate 
and mitigate the above-mentioned drawbacks. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a comb 
which may prevent the scalp from being hurted in use. It is another object of the present invention to provide a comb which 
will not pull by the hair. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a comb 
which is low in cost. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a comb 
which is fit for mass production. Other objects and merits and a fuller understanding to the present 
invention will be obtained by those having ordinary skill in the art when  
 
the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment is read in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of FIG.1, illustrating the left member 
being detached from the right member; FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a second preferred embodiment of the 
present invention; FIG. 4 is a perspective view of FIG.3, illustrating the left member 
being detached from the right member; FIG. 5 shows a perspective view of a third preferred embodiment; FIG.5A shows a plan view of another preferred embodiment similar 
to FIG.5; FIG 5B is a side view of FIG.5A; FIG. 6A shows a perspective view of the fourth preferred embodiment; FIG. 6B is a perspective view of the brush frame of the fourth preferred 
embodiment of Fig.6A; FIG.6C is a plan view of a comb set similar to Fig.6A; FIG. 7A shows a plan view of a fifth preferred embodiment; FIG. 7B is a side view of FIG. 7A; FIG. 8 shows a plan view of a sixth preferred embodiment; FIG. 9A shows a plan view of a seventh preferred embodiment; FIG. 9B is a side view of FIG. 9A;  FIG. 10A shows a plan view of an eighth preferred embodiment; FIG. 10B is a side view of FIG. 10A; FIG. 11 shows a plan view of another preferred embodiment, illustrating 
multiple line members joining togther acting as a single line 
member; FIG. 12 shows a disassembled perspective view of another preferred 
embodiment; FIG. 13 is an assembled perspective view of Fig. 12; FIG. 14

   a spine composed of two left members and a right members; and 

   a plurality of line members connected between said two left 
member and said right members and being each provided with an indentation 

at an intermediate portion; wherein said two left members is detachably 
fixed to said right member, and said plurality of line members 

are bent at the respective intermediate portion to form a plurality of parallel 
teeth at both lateral sides of said spine.
