<ABSTRACT>
A wideband amplifier circuit provides high current gain and a wide 
bandwidth by employing only NPN transistors, which have better high-frequency 

characteristics than those of PNP transistors, in the signal path. Wideband current 
amplification is achieved using NPN transistors in a current-mirror configuration, with 

base-emitter voltage matching to permit the current gain to be easily set as a function of 
transistor area. The wideband amplifier circuit can also be used in a differential 

wideband amplifier configuration to obtain a combination of high current gain, wide 
bandwidth and wide output swing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of transistor amplifier circuits capable of 
providing both a wide bandwidth and high gain. This invention relates more particularly to an amplifier circuit comprising:
 
an input terminal, an output terminal, a first supply line and a second supply line;
 
a first transistor having an emitter connected to the input terminal, a collector coupled 
to the first supply line and a base coupled to a first node;
 
a diode-connected second transistor having an emitter connected to the second supply 
line, a collector coupled to the emitter of the first transistor and a base connected to the 
collector of the second transistor;
 
a third transistor having an emitter connected to the second supply line, a base coupled 
to the base of the second transistor and a collector coupled to a second node;
 
a fourth transistor having an emitter coupled to the second node, a collector coupled to 
the first supply line and a base coupled to the first node;
 
a fifth transistor having an emitter connected to the second supply line, a collector 
coupled to the output terminal and a base coupled to the second node; and a bias current 
source coupled to the first node. An amplifier circuit of this type is known from United States Patent US 
4,028,631, Fig. 6. Typical single-stage prior-art differential or single-ended amplifier circuits 
having common emitter input transistors are capable of providing a wide bandwidth and 
good high-frequency characteristics, but such simple circuits suffer the drawback of not 
being capable of providing a high current gain, and may not have a full output swing. 
One typical prior-art technique for increasing the current gain of a circuit is to provide a 
pair of current mirrors, one mirror operating off the "high side" (the power supply line) 
and having its input coupled to the collector of the input transistor and the other mirror  
 
operating off the "low side" (ground) and having its input coupled to the output of the 
first current mirror. In this way the second current mirror provides an amplified output 
current having the same direction and phase as the collector current of the input 
transistor. However, it is noted that, assuming a NPN input transistor, in this technique 
the necessity for using PNP transistors in the high-side current mirror would 
substantially degrade the high-frequency performance of this circuit if it were to be used 
in a wideband amplifier. In the afore-mentioned amplifier circuit of United States Patent US
