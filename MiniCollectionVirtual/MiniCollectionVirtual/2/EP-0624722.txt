<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 1 for an electric fuel pump 2 of a motor 
vehicle comprises a signal processor, preferably 

incorporating non-volatile memory, as well as ROM and RAM, 
electrically connected to a serial communications link 

interface SCL configured to receive coded digitalized 
signals from an electronic device such as an engine 

management system 7 for example defining the engine's fuel 
requirements via a serial communications bus 3. A pump 

driver connected to the signal processor is configured for 
connection to the fuel pump 2 and for controlling the 

power fed to the pump 2 in accordance with the defined 
fuel requirements. 
The signal processor is optionally adapted for connection 
to an interrupt device INT such as an inertia switch and 

in the case of the preferred signal processor which is a 
microcontroller having a non-volatile memory, to an 

immobilizer device 6 such as a security coded device for 
coded full activation of the control module. 
The apparatus 1 and pump 2 may be installed within a fuel 
tank 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for the 
control of a fuel pump of a motor vehicle. Internal combustion engines such as diesel and petrol 
fuelled engines of motor vehicles are required to operate 
throughout a wide range of operating speeds and loads 
whereby the fuel needs are continually fluctuating 
according to the engine power demanded. In the case of engines in which fuel is injected into the 
combustion cylinders, the injectors are customarily fed 
from a fuel pump the output of which is often in excess 
of the fuel requirements of the engine, as in the case of 
deceleration for example. The excess fuel pumped has been 
returned to the fuel tank. This practice has been recognised for some time to be 
undesirable from the point of view of economy and the need 
to minimise environmental pollution both affected by the 
formation of vapours in the process of returning the 
sometimes hot fuel to the fuel tank. There have been many proposals made for the control of 
fuel pump speeds in accordance with the fuel requirements 
of an engine, sometimes with the expressed aim to reduce 
environmental pollution. In this connection reference may be made to the 
disclosures of the following published patent 
specifications:- GB 2070802A, GB 2120411A, GB 2229554A, 
EP 423636A, US 4205648, US 4248194, US 4249119,

4951636, PCT WO 82/04097, DE 3119899, DE 4036905 and 
DD 227193. In particular, patent document US 4565173 
discloses a motor-driven fuel pump and fuel injector 
controller which receives a mixture of analog inputs and 
high-low digital inputs from engine sensors, and then 
calculates and delivers an appropriate injector timing and 
fuel pump power duty cycle. The general outlay of a fuel injection and pump control is shown in fig.3 and the claims of 
US-A-4565173, showing: a controller 20 operating a fuel pump 23/24 of a motor vehicle, the fuel pump 
being electrically connected to a pump driver 23, the pump driver being further electrically connected to a 
signal processor, the signal processor 201-203 (CPU,RAM,ROM) being connected to an 
electrical supply of the motor vehicle and to a communication interface,coded digitised signals from engine 
condition sensors (Q, ACCEL SWITCH; A/D-converter) defining the fuel requirements of the motor vehicle 
are passed to the signal processor via the communications interface, the signal processor 201 then 
communicating pulse width information to the pump driver, thus controlling the rate
