<ABSTRACT>
An activated charcoal filter for the venting of a fuel tank is proposed. The said filter comprises a housing (10), which receives activated charcoal packs. The housing (10) is line-connected on the one hand by way of a first connection (12) to the fuel tank and on the other by way of a second connection to the intake pipe (11), especially of an internal combustion engine, and by way of a third connection (13) to the atmosphere. The housing (10) has a first dividing wall (16), which runs between the connection (13) for the atmosphere and the connection (12) for the tank. At least one further dividing wall (14) is provided, which forms at least one further chamber (17, 18), each of the chambers being filled with activated charcoal.

Activated carbon filter designed for purging of a fuel tank, comprising a housing 
(10) which includes an activated carbon pack and- with respect to its lines - which 

is, on the one hand, in conjunction with the fuel tank via a first connection (12) and 
- on the other hand - in conjunction with the suction pipe via a second connection 

(11), in particular with the suction pipe of an internal combustion engine, and 
furthermore in conjunction with the atmosphere via a third connection (13) with a 

first separating wall (14) being arranged inside the housing (10) between the 
connection (13) provided for the atmosphere and the connection (12) provided for 

the fuel tank and with at least one further separating wall being arranged inside 
the housing (10), which forms at least one additional chamber, with at least one 

chamber (17) being filled with activated carbon (22), characterized in that both 
separating walls (14, 16) are arranged in the shape of a cross, thereby creating at 

least 4 filter chambers (17, 18, 19, 20), one after the other being passed by fuel 
vapours, whereby said fuel vapours are adsorbed by the activated carbon. 
Activated carbon filter according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one 
chamber (20) incorporates further mechanical components, such as e.g. valves. 
Activated carbon filter according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a 
connectionless separation is provided between the chamber (19) containing the 

connection to the fuel tank (12) and the chamber having the atmospheric 
connection (13). 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the activated carbon (22 - 25) being in the respective chamber (17 - 20) is 

provided with a filtering foam (34), felt or fleece at the inlet and outlet of the gases 
running through, with said filtering foam having the effect of preventing from the 

activated carbon (22 - 25) to discharge.  
 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the cover and the bottom (15) of the housing (10) is provided with channels 

(33) which allow the fuel vapours to run through and which guide said fuel vapours 
to the nearest of each chamber. 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the connections (11, 12, 13) become engaged or clipped into the housing 

(10). 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the connections (11, 12, 13) and/or the housing cover is manufactured from plastic 

material and welded together with the plastic housing (10). 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the filtering foam (34), felt or fleece, located at the cover or at the supporting 

structure, is connected thereto by adhering or melting-on. 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the individual chambers (17 - 20) are filled with activated carbon of different 

pore structure. 
Activated carbon filter according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the chambers (17 - 20) have different cross-sections and lengths 

respectively.
