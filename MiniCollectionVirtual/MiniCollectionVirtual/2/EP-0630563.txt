<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals 
comprises a milking parlour (1) and a computer-controlled 

milking unit (29) with teat cups (52) which are automatically 
connectable to the teats of an animal to be milked. The 

device is further provided with a shield (35) preventing the 
milk unit (29) from being contaminated and/or damaged by the 

kicking of the animal. This shield (35) is movable to a 
position between the hindlegs of an animal present in the 

milking parlour (1) and the milking unit (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically 
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking parlour 
and a computer-controlled milking unit with teat cups which 
are automatically connectable to the teats of an animal to be 
milked. Such a device is known from EP-A-0 091 892. This 
known device has the disadvantage that, when the teat cups 
are brought under the udder of an animal and connected to the 
teats, the milking unit can be contaminated by splashing when 
the animal does its droppings in the milking parlour or be 
damaged when the animal kicks against it. The invention aims 
to obviate or at least to mitigate this disadvantage. For that purpose, according to the invention, the 
device is provided with a shield preventing the milking unit 
from being contaminated and/or damaged by kicking of the 
animal. This shield may be movable to a position between the 
hindlegs of the animal and the milking unit. In a particular 
embodiment the shield may be swivable around upwardly 
directed hinge pins by means of a first and second motor and 
height adjustable by means of a third electric motor, the 
motors being computer-controlled. Thereby, a favourable 
construction is obtained when the shield is connected to a 
swivable part of the support of the milking unit. Specifically to kicking the shield may be enforced 
by an upwardly directed portion of the swivable part of the 
support. The width of the shield may correspond approximately  
 
with the distance between the hind teats, while the height of 
the shield may correspond with the height of the teat cups. To prevent that the animal hurts herself, the upper 
side of the shield may be provided with a folded edge. Further the shield may be formed by a plate extending 
obliquely downwardly, changing into a horizontal part 
covering the lower side of the teat cups for the hind teats. For a better understanding of the invention an 
embodiment of the device for milking animals will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawing.

device for milking animals: Figure 2 is a schematical view along line II-II of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a schematic view of a cleaning and/or
