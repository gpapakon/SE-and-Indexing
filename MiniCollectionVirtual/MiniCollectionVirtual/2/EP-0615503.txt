<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
field of underwater diving, and more particularly to
the field of signalling from one diver to another while
under water.While diving under water, it is frequently desired
to communicate with another diver. In the absence of
expensive and sophisticated equipment, such
communication typically involves hand signals. But in
order to convey a message in this manner, it is first
necessary to get the other diver's attention. This is
frequently a problem if the other diver is not looking
at the diver wishing to convey the message, or at least
in his general direction, and this is particularly a
problem in situations where visibility is limited.When one diver wishes to get the attention of
another, the first diver will typically reach down and
unbuckle a knife carried adjacent the ankle or the
like. Using the knife, the first diver will then rap
on the air tank attached to his back to produce a
percussive sound which is easily heard by any nearby
diver. The percussive sound produced is also not
natural, so that the other diver is alerted that
someone is trying to get their attention. In addition,
the other diver also gets some sense of the direction
from which the sound originated.While such a sound producing system is effective,
it suffers from a number of disadvantages. For
example, the reaching for and grasping of the knife is
time consuming, so that if the attention of the other
diver is required immediately (i.e., to see something
which may swim away), it may be too late once this form
of communication is accomplished. In addition, in 
unbuckling of the knife from its holster on the ankle,
the knife is subject to being accidentally dropped.
Dropping of the knife not only prevents communication,
but the knife itself may be irretrievable or lost.United States patent no. 4326706 discloses a glove
for joggers which includes a weight fixed to its back
side in the metacarpal area and another weight
removably applied to the palm side of the glove at the
outer metacarpal area. The first weight is surrounded
by a plastic flanged cover and the palm side weight is
enclosed in a pocket from which it can be removed.In accordance with the present invention, a hand
worn signalling mechanism is provided which overcomes
the problems of the prior art,
according to the features of independent claim 1 or 2. In a preferred embodiment, the flexible article is
mounted adjacent to the palm of the user such that the
striker is laterally adjacent a center of the palm and
longitudinally
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hand worn signalling article for use in scuba
diving by an underwater user wearing an air tank for

producing a sound using the air tank as a percussive
instrument comprising:


a glove (10) worn on a hand of a user which
extends at least across a portion of a palm of the

hand; characterised in that the signalling article
includes:
a hard striker (14,48); and
a mounting means (18,50) for mounting said striker
to an outer side of said glove

adjacent the palm of the user and with at least a top
portion of said striker exposed,
whereby in use the user easily produces a
percussive sound by direct striking of an air tank worn

by the user with said striker worn on the hand of the
user.
A hand worn signalling article for use in scuba
diving by an underwater user wearing an air tank for 

producing a sound using the air tank as a percussive
instrument comprising:


a flexible article (40) worn on a hand of a user
which extends at least across a portion of a palm of

the hand and the ends of which are fastenable together
to secure the article onto the hand of the user;

characterised in that the signalling article includes:

a hard striker (14,48); and
a mounting means (18,50) for mounting said striker
to an outer side of said flexible article adjacent the

palm of the user and with at least a top portion of
said striker exposed,
whereby in use the user easily produces a
percussive sound by direct striking of an air tank worn

by the user with said striker worn on the hand of the
user.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 1 or
Claim 2 wherein said flexible article or glove is

mounted adjacent to the palm of the user such that said
striker is laterally adjacent a center of the palm and

longitudinally between a position near the center and a 
distal end of the palm.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 3 wherein
said striker is made of a corrosion resistant, hard

metal.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 4 wherein
said mounting means mounts said striker to said

flexible article or glove such that said striker is
loosely held to said flexible article or glove.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 5 and
further including a hard backer plate (32) attached to

an inner side of said flexible article or glove
adjacent said striker.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 6 wherein
said striker is shaped as a cylinder with a

longitudinal aperture, and wherein said mounting means
includes a flexible member (20) passing through said

longitudinal aperture and secured to said flexible
article or glove. 
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 7 wherein
said flexible article or glove is a band.
A signalling article as claimed in Claim 1 or
Claim 2 wherein said striker is shaped as a cylinder

with a longitudinal aperture, and wherein said mounting
means includes a flexible member (20) passing through

said longitudinal aperture and secured to said flexible
article or glove; and further including a hard backer

plate attached to an inner side of said flexible
article or glove adjacent said striker.
A method for signalling underwater by a scuba
diver comprising the steps of wearing a signalling

article according to any one of the above claims and
tapping of the striker directly against an air tank

worn by the diver to produce a percussive sound.
A method for signalling as claimed in Claim 10
wherein the striker is a corrosion resistant, hard

cylinder with a central longitudinal aperture; and
wherein said attaching step includes the steps of 

passing a flexible strap through the aperture and
securing the flexible strap to the flexible article.
