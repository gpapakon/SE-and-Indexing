Control lever (1) for switching or actuating components of 
a commercial motor vehicle such as a wheeled loader or such 

like, with a grip (2) which is ergonomically adapted to the 
hand and adjoins a head (3) with switching elements (6, 7) 

arranged in such a manner that they lie within reach of the 
thumb of the hand encompassing the grip (2), characterised in 

that:
 
the spatial location of a series of first switching elements 

(6) in relation to the grip (2) is chosen in such a way that 
they are located approximately on a circular arc (9), the 

radius of which corresponds approximately to the radius of the 
thumb of the hand encompassing the grip (2),
 
a series of additional switching elements (7) is arranged on 

another circular arc above the series of first switching 
elements (6),
 
the switching elements (6) consist of buttons (10, 11, 12, 13) 

for: travelling forwards, travelling backwards, shifting down 
by one gear and transporting a working implement to a 

predetermined position and
 
the additional switching elements (7) consist of a button (15) 

for selecting the neutral position of a gear mechanism and two 
buttons (16, 17) for selecting the gear by shifting the gear 

mechanism up or down. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
symbols are assigned to the buttons (10 to 13 and 15 to 17), 

said symbols being disposed on a replaceable carrier (18), for 
example a self-adhesive foil. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the functions performed by the switching elements (6, 7) are 

capable of being changed by means of a variably programmable 
electronic control system. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a perceptible boundary (14) is arranged between two adjacent 

switching elements (10, 11) by way of safety device for  
 

preventing incorrect operation. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the gearstick (1) is capable of being tilted by pushing and 

pulling. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the gearstick (1) - viewed from the side - is inclined 

forwards by about 15 degrees to 30 degrees in relation to the 
vertical. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
on the rear side of the gearstick (1) facing away from the 

switching elements (6, 7) at least one button (20) is arranged 
which is actuated with the index finger of the hand. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
within the head (3) of the gearstick (1) there are arranged 

signalling elements which, for example, indicate visually the 
chosen direction of travel. 
Control lever according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the grip (2) in its lower region merges into an approximately 

collar-shaped support (5) for the ball of the thumb.
