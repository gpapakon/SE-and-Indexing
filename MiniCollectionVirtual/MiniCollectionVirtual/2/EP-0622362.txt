<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of 2(3H)-benzothiazolones which are optionally substituted on the benzene ring, which comprises reacting a 2-aminobenzothiazole which is optionally substituted on the benzene ring with a diazotizing agent in the presence of aqueous hydrochloric acid, if appropriate with an addition of a chloride, to give a diazonium chloride, reacting the diazonium chloride immediately to give a 2-chlorobenzothiazole which is optionally substituted on the benzene ring, and hydrolyzing the 2-chlorobenzothiazole at 120@C-200@C under the reaction pressure without intermediate isolation.
