<ABSTRACT>
Silica-alumina fibers having good mechanical strength 
and heat resistance are produced by mixing a polyaluminoxane which 

comprises repeating units of the formula: 

in which X is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or a hydroxy group, a 
silicon-containing compound in an amount of not larger than 40 % by 

weight in terms of silica based on the weight of silica-alumina 
fibers to be produced, and an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 2 to 14 

carbon atoms in an alkyl group in an amount of 0.03 to 0.4 mole per 
one gram atom of aluminum to obtain a spinning liquid, spinning the 

spinning liquid under a condition that the content of non-volatile materials 
in the solution is maintained at least 97 % by weight to form 

precursor fibers, and calcining the precursor fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a 
silica-alumina fiber. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
method for producing silica-alumina fibers comprising steps of 
mixing polyaluminoxane with a specific amount of a silicon-containing 
compound and a specific aliphatic carboxylic acid, spinning the 
resulting spinning liquid to obtain a precursor fiber and calcining the 
precursor fiber to obtain a silica-alumina fiber having good 
mechanical strength and heat resistance, which method is excellent 
in spinnability and spinning. As methods for producing a silica-alumina fiber, there 
are known an inorganic salt method, a slurry method, a sol-gel 
method and a precursor polymer method. The inorganic salt method comprises the steps of adding 
a water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene oxide or polyvinyl 
alcohol to an aqueous solution of an aluminum salt, mixing water-soluble 
polysiloxane or silica sol in the solution, and condensing and 
heat aging the solution to obtain a viscous spinning solution. Since 
this method imparts the viscosity to the solution by the water-soluble 
organic polymer, the solution is gelled in the preparation 
step of the solution, so that the spinning solution lacks stability. The slurry method adds a crystalline growth suppressing 
agent, a binder component and an organic polymer such as polyethylene 
oxide to fine alumina particles and uses the resulting  
 
viscous slurry as a spinning liquid. In this method, since the particle 
size of the solid particles, their amounts and the state of dispersion 
have influences on the spinning property and the mechanical properties 
of the spun fiber, their control is very difficult. The sol-gel method condenses an alumina sol containing 
an ion such as HCOO- or CH3COO- and a silica sol to form a viscous 
spinning liquid. In this method, since the components tend to precipitate, 
the solution becomes turbid or the viscosity suddenly increases 
in the condensation step, the control of condensation is difficult. The precursor polymer method prepares a spinning liquid 
by mixing a silicon-containing compound such as a silicate ester 
with polyaluminoxane. In this method, since homogeneity of the spinning 
liquid is high and neither the organic polymer nor the binder is 
necessary, the obtained fiber is characterized in its high mechanical 
strength. But, since the polyaluminoxane is easily hydrolyzed, the 
spinning stability is low, and the strength of the obtained fiber 
varies greatly. Then, a modified
