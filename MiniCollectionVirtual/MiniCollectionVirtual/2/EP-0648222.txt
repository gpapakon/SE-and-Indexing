<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining the identity of a nucleotide base at a specific position in a nucleic acid of interest is described. The identity of the nucleotide is based on whether or not a primer is extendable in the presence of a specific substrate nucleotide. The nucleotide base to be determined lies at the 3' end immediately adjacent to the 3' end nucleotide of the primer. The primer would be extended if the substrate nucleotide is complementary to the nucleotide base in the nucleic acid of interest, and it would not if there is no said complementarity. The method used to determine a normal and mutated gene is illustrated in the figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the identification of specific 
nucleotide sequences and to the detection of mutations at particular sites 
within nucleotide sequences. More particularly, the present invention concerns a method and kit 
for the detection of the presence of a certain sequence in a sample of 
genetic material. The method and kit of the present invention are highly 
sensitive to small alterations in the sequence and thus are useful in the 
detection of point mutations, i.e., single base-pair alterations in a DNA 
sequence. The present method and kit are also useful for identifying the 
presence of foreign genetic material in a sample of genetic sequence, for 
example, for detecting the presence of specific bacterial or viral nucleotide 
sequences in plant and animal DNA. In recent years with the development of methods such as polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) and various automated DNA sequencing techniques, 
an extremely large number of human genes have been isolated, identified 
and fully sequenced. One of the consequences of such developments has 
been the elucidation of the genetic basis of many diseases such as, for 
example, Cystic Fibrosis, Hemophilia, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Î²-thalassemia. 
Sickle Cell Anemia, Phenylketonuria, Tay-Sachs, Gaucher and 
many others. A large number of genetic diseases have been shown to be 
caused by point mutations in the gene or by deletion or insertion of a 
known number of nucleotides. As a consequence of such point mutations  
 
or small sequence alterations the protein encoded by such genes is not 
produced, prematurely truncated or is produced in a modified form which 
affects its function. Furthermore, many cancers have been shown to be 
associated with point mutations in certain genes. In view of the aforementioned development, it is now possible to 
obtain genetic material from an individual, amplify a certain gene region 
using PCR technology, and then sequence this region using commercially 
available sequencing techniques. The sequenced gene region may then be 
compared with the known normal sequence to determine whether the 
individual has a mutation at any particular site in this region. In this way, 
it is possible to determine whether an individual has a certain disease or 
whether an individual is a "carrier", i.e., is heterozygous for the mutation 
of the site tested. When the sequencing is performed on fetal cells, it 
becomes possible to determine the chances that the fetus will bear a certain 
inherited disease. This may allow the

Method for determining whether or not one of one or more 
given nucleotide bases is present at a specific position 

in a target nucleic acid contained in a sample, said 
method comprising the steps of: 


(a) if the target nucleic acid in said sample is double-stranded, 
treating said sample to render a region 

spanning said specific position single-stranded; or, if 
the target nucleic acid in said sample is single 

stranded, proceeding directly to step (b); and 
(b) forming a hybrid between said target nucleic acid in 
said sample and a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide 

primer, said primer hybridizing to a region on said 
target that is directly downstream (3') from said 

specific position, such that a nucleotide base added to 
the 3'end of said primer would be complementary to said 

specific position; and 
(c) contacting said hybrid with one or more primer 
extension units, said primer extension unit including 

an extension moiety and a separation moiety, which is  
 

selected from the group consisting of antibodies, 
antigens, haptens, lectins and carbohydrates, in the 

presence of a template-dependent extension enzyme under 
conditions such that if said extension moiety of one of 

said primer extension units is complementary to said 
specific position, said primer extension unit will 

become covalently attached to the 3'end of said primer; 
and 
(d) contacting said primer with a solid support having an 
affinity for the separation moiety of the primer 

extension unit, under conditions that promote the 
attachment of said separation moiety to said suport; 

and 
(e) determining whether said labeled primers have 
substantially become attached to said solid support, 

such substantial attachment indicating that the 
nucleotide base present at said specific position is a 

base comlementary to one of the one or more extension 
moieties used, and the substantial absence of such 

attachment indicating that said nucleotide base is not 
a base that is complementary to one of the one or more 

extension moieties used. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein said 
fluorescently labeled primer has multiple label moieties 

attached thereto.  
 
The method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
fluorescently labeled primer has multiple label moieties 

attached at multiple locations on said primer.  
 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the separation moiety of step (c) is biotin. 
The method according to claim 4, wherein said solid 
support of step (d) is an avidin-coated microtiter plate 

well. 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein unreacted primer extension units are not removed 

from the sample resulting from step (c) prior to 
commencing step (d). 
The method according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein said method determines whether or not given bases 

are present in any of a plurality of specific positions 
in one or more target nucleic acids contained in a 

sample, wherein said method is modified in that hybrids 

are formed in said step (b) between said target nucleic 
acids in said sample and a plurality of said labeled 

oligonucleotide primers, one for each of said plurality 
of specific positions
