<ABSTRACT>
The diaphragm for a cell can reliably ensure safety by causing the cell to lose the function when the temperature 
abnormally rises due to external short-circuit or the like. The cell comprises positive and negative electrodes, and a 

diaphragm. The diaphragm comprises polymer porous body which is hydrophilized, and polymer grains whose fusion 
point is 80 to 170 °C, and which include grains of ethylene copolymer having side chains. The polymeric grains are 

carried by the polymerically porous body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery diaphragm
and a battery, and more particularly, it relates to a
battery which is excellent in battery characteristics and
safety and a diaphragm therefor.In recent years, capacities and outputs are increased
in primary and secondary batteries such as an alkaline
manganese battery, a nickel-cadmium battery, a nickel-hydrogen
battery, and a lithium battery, and application
ranges thereof are now being abruptly widened.Following this, a safety hazard in an abnormal state
has been highlighted as to these batteries. Particularly
in the lithium battery which is widely applied to
electronics or the like, the temperature of the battery
may abruptly rise to increase the internal pressure if an
overcharge or an external short is caused by discrepancy
in handling, leading to spouting of an electrolyte.In order to prevent occurrence of an abnormal state
caused by such an external short or the like, there has
generally been studied a method of increasing resistance
of a diaphragm for suppressing a short-circuit current,
thereby inhibiting heat generation. As a concrete example 
of such a method, there has been developed a technique of
insulating the diaphragm at a temperature of not more than
180°C, which is the melting point of lithium, and
extremely increasing internal resistance of the battery,
thereby suppressing a short-circuit current and inhibiting
heat generation as described below, for example.Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-16139 (Japanese
Patent Laying-Open No. 60-52) discloses a diaphragm
consisting of polypropylene nonwoven fabric having a
surface which is previously impregnated with polyethylene
fine powder. When a battery employing such a diaphragm is
heated, polyethylene is melted to block pores of the
diaphragm. Consequently, ion permeability of the
diaphragm is extremely reduced, to suppress temperature
rise of the battery.On the other hand, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 3-283259
discloses a battery employing a diaphragm
comprising a synthetic resin fine porous film having at
least one surface covered with a polymer powder aggregate
such as a polyethylene powder aggregate, for example,
having a softening temperature of 95 to 160°C.Further, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 3-291848
also discloses a battery employing a diaphragm comprising
a synthetic resin fine porous film which is covered with a
resin porous powder aggregate. This powder aggregate has 
a softening point of 95 to 160°C, and contains 1 to 50
wt.% of particles of 0.01 to 1 µm in particle
