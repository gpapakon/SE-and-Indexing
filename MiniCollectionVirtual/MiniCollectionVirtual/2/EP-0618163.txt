<ABSTRACT>
What is claimed is a device for severing an oncoming material web on winding machines and for attaching it again to a winding tube, a severing knife and an attaching brush connected fixedly to it being pivoted into the path of the material web for severing purposes, and the severing knife being accelerated by means of a hydraulically driven motor, controlled by a stepping control motor, via a shaft at an angle of 130@, whereupon the severing operation takes place between 230@ and 260@ and, after approximately a further 90@, the shaft comes to a stop again. A transverse severance of a material web, even at high speeds, is possible thereby. To prevent deformations of the severing knife, the shaft of the hydraulic motor is provided with a compensating shaft.

<CLAIMS>
A device for cutting and reattaching an incoming
material web (1), in winders, to a core (4), which is

driven in rotation by a shaft, the incoming material web
(1) being pressed onto the core (4) by means of a deflection

roll (3), around which the material web wraps
partially, and the outgoing material web, after leaving

the core (4), being cut by means of a cutting knife (12),
which can be moved into the path of the material web, can

be driven by a force store (17) and extends transversely
with respect to the course of the web, and, following the

cutting of the material web (1), the new web start being
attached, by an attaching brush (13), which is fixedly

connected to the cutting knife (12) and extends
transversely with respect to the material web (1), the

cutting knife (12), which is connected to a shaft (16),
being accelerated with respect to the running material

web (1) in such a manner that the speed of the knife (12)
is greater than the running speed of the material web

(1), wherein the shaft (16), which is acted on by a
hydraulic motor (17), can be driven in rotation in the

web running direction, and wherein the radius of the

cutting knife (12) and that of the attaching brush (13)
are dimensioned such that the attaching brush (13)

attaches the new web start to the circumference of the
core (4) over an angle between 40° and 90°, while the

cutting knife (12) just does not touch the core (4), and
wherein, for the cutting operation, the shaft (16) with

the cutting knife (12) is accelerated to a circumferential
speed of at least 1.5 times the running speed 

of the material web (1).
A method of cutting a material web (1), having a
device (9) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the hydraulic

motor (17), via an intermittent-motion controller,
accelerates the shaft (16) with the cutting knife (12) to

the circumferential speed of at least 1.5 times the
running speed of the material web (1) over about a 130°

angle of rotation of the shaft (16) with the cutting
knife (12), wherein the position in which the cutting

operation is effected is reached in the range between an
angle of rotation of about 130° and 260°, and then the

rotation is braked and brought to a standstill at about
350° angle of rotation, and the hydraulic motor (17) is

subsequently brought into its initial position.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the angle
between knife and film at the instant of cutting is about

90°.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein, before
the cut, the material web wraps around the core to about

one quarter of its circumference.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein at the
instant of the transverse cutting of the material web the

attaching brush rests on the core.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
cutting and attaching device (9) can be pivoted into the

path of the material web (1) immediately before the
cutting operation and can be pivoted out once more

immediately thereafter.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein, at least
during the winding of one roll of tape, a pressure roller

(10, 10') that can be pivoted away rests on each core
(4, 8).
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
surface of the core has contact-adhesive properties, so

that after the cutting operation the material web adheres
to the core.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein immediately
before the cutting operation the surface of the

core is sprayed with an adhesive or with water (27). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein a compensating
shaft (18) of adjustable (19) mass is arranged

with respect to the drive shaft (16) so as to lie opposite
the cutting knife (12).
