<ABSTRACT>
An ink-tank cartridge has a first storage 
chamber (53) housing a negative pressure generating 

member (52) and having an atmosphere communicating 
portion communicated with the atmosphere, a second 

storage chamber (56) in substantially enclosed 
condition and communicated with the first storage 

chamber (53) only through a fine communicating 
portion located remote from said atmosphere 

communicating portion (57), and directly storing an 
ink to be supplied to the first storage chamber 

(53), the second storage chamber (56) being arranged 
adjacent the first storage chamber (53); and an 

enclosed ink storage portion (9) only communicated 
with the second storage chamber (56) and located at 

respective side surfaces of the first and second 
storage chambers (53, 56). The bottom surface of 

the enclosed ink storage portion (9) is located at

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
exchangeable, composite and integrated ink-tank
cartridge which is connected to an ink-jet head and
storing an ink to be supplied thereto, and an ink-jet
recording apparatus employing the ink-tank
cartridge. The present invention further relates to
an ink-tank cartridge having a specific internal
structure, provides an ink jet head and a printer
which use the ink-tank cartridge, and is applicable
for recording apparatuses such as copy machine,
facsimile and so forth, communication apparatuses,
office work apparatuses, composite apparatuses,
printer and so forth, employing an ink-jet
technologies.In the recent years, ink-jet recording apparatus
have been progressively made compact and have been
proposed in variety of configurations adapting to
manner of use in personal basis. In particular, in
the case of the recording apparatus for personal
use, such a type of apparatus employing an
integrated exchangeable cartridge, in which a
recording head portion and an ink tank portion are
integrated as a single unit, is becoming a preferred 
configuration for compact construction and low cost.
In such apparatus, monochrome recording (principally
recording characters) type apparatus employing only
black ink have been majority. However, even in such
apparatus for personal use, variety of manners of
use have been developed to raise demand for color
recording (including multi-tone recording) or full-color
recording.Most easy construction for performing such color
recording is to prepare necessary number of carriage
mounting head-tank integration type cartridge, and
to mount the head-tank integration type cartridges
filled with necessary color inks on the carriages.
In such construction, the carriage is, however,
required for each of the head-tank integration type
cartridge to be mounted to make the entire apparatus
bulky.On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application
Laying-open No. 198861/1990 proposes an ink tank
cartridge, in which the recording head portion and
the ink tank portion can be separated in order to
effectively use a recording head which has much
longer life than ink contained in an ink tank.
Also, in the above-identified publication, there is
proposed an integrated construction of an ink tank
cartridge portion for four colors (yellow, magenta,
cyan and black) for performing color recording.However, in such four colors integrated type ink
tank cartridge, frequencies of use of the colors are
differentiated depending upon an image for color
recording. Typically,

<CLAIMS>
An ink cartridge connectable to an ink jet recording
apparatus, comprising a housing having front, back, side,

top and bottom walls and containing:

a first chamber (53) for supplying ink to a
recording head, the first chamber containing negative

pressure producing material (52) and having an air
vent (58) communicating with atmosphere;
a second chamber (56) disposed behind the first
chamber in a direction from the front to the back wall

of the housing and providing a reservoir for the first
chamber and communicating with the first chamber via a

communication port (57); and
a third chamber (9) providing a reservoir for the
second chamber and communicating only with the second

chamber, the second chamber being substantially closed
apart from the communication with the first and third

chambers;
