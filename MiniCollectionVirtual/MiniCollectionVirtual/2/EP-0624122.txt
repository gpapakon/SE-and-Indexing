<ABSTRACT>
Injection moulding of plastic materials is a well known and practised process. There is also a well known group of processes referred to as ''gas-assisted injection moulding''. This invention concerns apparatus for and method of injecting the gas into injection mouldings at one ore more positions within an injection moulding tool so that the gas passes between shut-out faces (9) of the mould (1) at positions which are completely surrounded by plastic (10) during and after the mould filling cycle. The gas may be injected through porous sintered metal inserts located at the surface of the cavity of the mould. At the end of the cycle, gas can also be exhausted via the path of entry of the gas (4, 16). This invention covers advantageous methods of injecting the gas into the plastic compared with other existing known methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for and method of
injection moulding and in particular to gas-assisted or
gas injection moulding.During recent years there have been various
developments of methods of injecting a fluid normally in
gaseous form into molten synthetic plastics material as
it enters or after it has filled an injection moulding
tool cavity. The gas forms continuous channels or hollow
sections within the plastic moulding.The objectives of assisting the moulding process by
the injection of gas into the plastic can include one or
more of the following - reduction of weight by replacing
plastic material with hollow gas channels, reduction in
process cooling time, reduction in moulded-in stress,
reduction or elimination of surface sink marks, combining
thick and thin sections within a moulding design
including the incorporation of webs, pillars and other
design features, and more uniform pressurisation of the
moulding as the plastic cools and solidifies.In a known method gas is injected into the plastic
at a number of alternative positions including the 
moulding machine nozzle, in the hot or cold sprue, in the
plastic runners, or directly into the mould cavity. The
gas is injected directly into the plastic when in a
molten state and remains under pressure until the plastic
has solidified, following which the gas is exhausted to
atmosphere before the mould opens and the moulding is
ejected from the mould.There is a problem of preventing the molten plastic
from flowing back into the gas injection device or hollow
tube or pin before or after the injection of the gas
takes place and when the pressure in the molten plastic
is greater than the pressure applied to the gas from its
external feed or pressure source. Some of the known
methods require hydraulically or mechanically operated
valves or other mechanisms within the moulding tools or
moulding machines for the injection of the gas.It is a prerequisite of gas-assisted moulding
processes that the gas is evacuated and the pressure 15
relieved within the mould cavity before the mould is
opened. If the gas is trapped within the moulding or
runners at the time of ejection there can be an expansion
of the plastic resulting from internal pressure which is
sufficiently high can lead to explosion of the moulding
or runners. It is therefore important that the gas can
be exhausted and the gas channels are free from blockage 
with fragments of plastic or other material.This invention seeks to achieve a more consistent
and reliable injection of gas into the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for injection moulding comprising a mould
having two parts (1 and 2) which may be placed together

to define a mould cavity (26), means (21) for feeding
synthetic plastics material to the mould cavity, means

(3) for feeding gas under pressure to the mould cavity at
a position displaced from the means for feeding synthetic

plastics material such that the gas can be injected into
the synthetic plastics material and for exhausting gas

from the mould cavity, said means for feeding gas
comprising means (9,60) permitting passage of gas whilst

preventing passage of synthetic plastics material
characterised in that the mould has a formation around

the means for feeding gas such that in operation of the
mould a seal is formed by the synthetic plastics material

to prevent the gas from escaping between the plastics and
adjacent mould surface.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the means
for permitting passage of gas whilst preventing passage

of synthetic plastics materials comprises a gap between
shut out faces of adjacent mould parts which permits

passage of gas but prevent passage of plastics.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the means
for permitting passage of gas whilst preventing passage

of synthetic plastics material comprises a porous insert 
(60).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which the
formation defines a ring which surrounds the gas

injection point.
A method of injection moulding including the steps of
feeding synthetic plastics material to a mould cavity

defined by a mould having two parts, feeding gas to the
mould cavity under pressure at a position displaced from

the plastics material feed whereby to pressurise plastics
material in the mould and inject gas into the material,

preventing plastics material from entering the gas feed,
and exhausting the gas from the mould and opening the

mould to remove the moulded product characterised in that
gas is prevented from escaping between the plastics and

adjacent mould surface by gas pressure urging synthetic
plastics material against a mould surface to produce a

seal.
A method as claimed in claim 5, in which the pressure
of the gas is controlled in order to assist the moulding

process.
A method as claimed in claim 5 or 6, in which the

timing of injection of the gas is controlled.
A method as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7, in which gas 
pressure is applied within a sealed area to transmit pressure to plastics

material outside that area to urge plastic material to compensate for
shrinkage.
