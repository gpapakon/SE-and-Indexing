<ABSTRACT>
A steam power plant for generating electric power has a fossil-fuelled boiler, a water-steam circuit for generating high-tension, superheated steam for a steam turbine, an economiser to transmit heat from flue gas to the water supply, an air preheater to transmit flue gas heat to fresh air and devices for removing dust, sulphur and possibly nitrogen from the flue gases. In order to optimise heat exchange in the air preheater during operation and reduce the heat losses during start-up of the steam power plant, a heat exchanger system is provided with sections through which recirculated air and a heat vehicle medium flow, in which the section carrying the air is connected on the intake side to the fresh-air outlet of the air preheater and on the outlet side to the fresh-air intake of the air preheater.

<CLAIMS>
Steam power generating plant for generating
electrical energy with a fossil fuel-fired boiler, a

water steam circuit for generating high pressure superheated
water vapour for a steam turbine, an air preheater

(3) for transmitting flue gas heat to the total quantity
of fresh air required, and a first heat exchanger system

(16, 17) with a cross-section through which recirculated
air flows and a cross-section trough which a heat-carrying

medium flows, whereby the air-conveying cross-section
is connected on the inlet side (14) to the fresh

air outlet of the air preheater (3) and on the outlet
side (13) to the fresh air inlet of the air preheater

(3), a second heat exchanger system (6, 11, 12) for
transmitting at least a part of the residual heat

remaining in the flue gas prior to desulphurisation to
the fresh air and with devices for removal of dust,

removal of sulphur and where necessary removal of
nitrogen from the flue gases, characterised in that in

the first heat exchanger system the heat given off can be
transmitted exclusively mainly to high pressure feed

water (16) and for the remainder to low pressure feed
water of the water steam circuit and within the second

heat exchanger system (6, 11, 12) residual heat from the
flue gas can be transmitted exclusively to the fresh air.
Steam power generating plant according to claim 1,
characterised in that the stream of recirculated air of 

the first heat exchanger system (16, 17) can be regulated
(18).
Steam power generating plant according to claims 1
or 2, characterised in that the second heat exchanger

system (6, 11, 12) takes the form of a closed system with
water as the heat-carrying medium.
