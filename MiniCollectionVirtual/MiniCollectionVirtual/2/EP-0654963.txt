<ABSTRACT>
An automotive baling press for plants cultivated in the field has a chassis (1, 2, 3), an engine (4), a pressing channel which extends in the direction of travel and which contains a piston (8) driven by a crank mechanism, and a device for supplying the harvested plants to the pressing channel. This baling press is used to harvest vegetable raw materials, such as eulalia (Miscanthus), directly in the fields and to press them into large bales in a single passage. For that purpose, the driver's cab (5) is arranged at the center of the chassis front side, the engine (4) with transverse axle is arranged behind the driver's cab and the crank mechanism (7) of the press is arranged behind the engine. The supply device has several attachments designed for different plants and selectively mountable on the machine. The conveyor section has several conveyor means and at least one preliminary processing device (25, 33).

Automotive baling press for plants cultivated in the field with a chassis (1, 2, 
3), a engine (4), a baling channel extending in the direction of travel with a 

piston (8), a crank mechanism (7) driven by the engine (4) with an axle (15) 
positioned at right angles to the direction of travel, which crank mechanism 

moves the piston (8), and with a device for feeding the crop into the baling 
channel, characterised in that a driver's cab (5) is arranged at the centre of 

the chassis front side, the engine (4) with a transverse axle is arranged 
behind the driver's cab and the crank mechanism (7) of the baling channel is 

arranged behind the engine, whereby the engine (4) is mechanically 
connected with the crank mechanism (7) by gearing, in that the feeder device 

comprises an upwards pivotable conveyor channel (9) extending under the 
driver's cab (5) and the engine (4) and a loading channel (34) extending 

under the crank mechanism, rising along its course and exiting from below 
into the baling channel, whereby the front receiving end of the conveyor 

channel (9) comprises a first connection device (12) for one of several 
attachments (e.g. 27) which are designed for different plants and can be fitted 

as required, or for a processor (30) and a processor (25, 33) is arranged in 
the transfer region between the rear output end of the conveyor channel (9) 

and the input of the loading channel (34).
