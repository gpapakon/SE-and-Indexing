<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of substrate surfaces for adhesive bonding or coating with organic adhesives which can be applied in liquid form, the process comprising the application to the surface to be bonded or coated of a composition comprising   (A) from 0.01 to 90% by weight of optionally silanised material having a particle size 
<
 5 mu m and a hardness greater than that of the substrate surface and/or (B) from 20 to 100% by weight of silanised, silicon-containing material having an average particle size of from 2 to 200  mu m and (C) for the remaining part an abrasive having a particle size 
>
 5 mu m, the proportions being based on the overall weight of (A), (B) and (C), and the composition additionally comprising   (D) if desired, a binder suitable for forming a solid from the abovementioned components, and (E)if desired, a diluent and/or dispersant or a mixture of these auxiliaries, in order to obtain a consistency suitable for processing, and the process further comprises fixing components (A) and/or (B) on the substrate by means of frictional forces acting in the horizontal or predominantly in the horizontal direction. The invention also relates to an abrasive which is suitable for carrying out this process.
