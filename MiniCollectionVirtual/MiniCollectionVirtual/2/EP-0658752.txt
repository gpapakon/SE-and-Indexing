<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermometer arrangement having at least one temperature-sensitive element which is arranged within a sleeve closed on one side and is connected to electrical connecting means. In such a thermometer arrangement, in order to increase the point-like character of the temperature measurement, and nevertheless to arrange the thermosensitive element in a protected manner, it is proposed according to the invention that means (2, 20) be introduced within the sleeve (6), and that the sleeve (6) with the electrical connecting means (4, 5) be connected mechanically in the assembled state in such a manner that the temperature-sensitive element (1) is pressed onto the bottom (9) of the sleeve (6) in a non-positive manner via the introduced means.
