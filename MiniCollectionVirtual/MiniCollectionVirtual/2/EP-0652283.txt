<ABSTRACT>
Plastics are advantageously cleaned by bringing them into contact with an alkaline aqueous solution which contains an inorganic peroxide compound and a complexing agent without acidic groups in free or salt form. The plastic can be employed in this case as shaped article or in finely divided form.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the purification of plastics, which 
comprises bringing the plastic into contact with 

an alkaline aqueous solution which contains an 

inorganic peroxide compound and a complexing agent 
without acidic groups in free or salt form and, if 

required, a base. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
plastic is used in the form of a molding, which is 

purified on the surface. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
plastic is used in finely divided form and the 

impurities are extracted. 
An aqueous, alkaline purification solution, which 
is free of builder, containing 


a) an inorganic peroxide, 
b) a complexing agent without acidic groups in 
free or salt form and, if required, 
c) a base. 
The solution as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
complexing agent is an alkanolamine. 
The solution as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein 
the complexing agent is triethanolamine. 
The solution as claimed in one or more of claims 4 
to 6, wherein the peroxide is hydrogen peroxide. 
The solution as claimed in one or more of claims 4 
to 7, wherein the solution contains a surfactant.
