<ABSTRACT>
Adrenal autoantigen is isolated and characterised as a protein obtainable from the microsome fraction of the adrenal gland, having a molecular weight of about 50,000 to 60,000 and antigenic towards adrenal autoantibody. The protein innative, recombinant or modified form as well as fragments thereof comprising an epitope for adrenal autoantibody are used in a method and kit for detecting adrenal autoantibodies. The protein is also useful as a medicament for treating Addisson's disease. Absorption studies show that the autoantigen is steroid 21-hydroxylase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adrenal autoantigen. More particularly, it relates
to immunoassays for adrenal autoantibodies involving adrenal autoantigen. The
invention further relates to methods of using adrenal autoantigen in the diagnosis
of autoimmune Addison's disease.Addison's disease is a disorder characterised by failure of the adrenal gland and
is often an autoimmune disorder involving destruction of the adrenal cortex and
the presence of adrenal autoantibodies in the patient's serum. The adrenal cortex
is responsible for producing several steroid hormones including cortisol,
aldosterone and testosterone. In autoimmune Addison's disease and other forms
of the disease, levels of these hormones are reduced. This reduction in hormone
levels is responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease which include low
blood pressure, muscle weakness, increased skin pigmentation and electrolyte
imbalance.Autoantibodies to the adrenal cortex were first described in 1957 using the
technique of complement fixation1. Subsequently other laboratories confirmed the
presence of these autoantibodies using complement fixation or
immunofluorescence2-4. Radioimmunoassay and ELISA techniques have also been
described using crude adrenal membrane preparations5-6.The preparation of purified rabbit adrenal autoantigen was reported in 19737 but
the isolation of human adrenal autoantigen remained an elusive goal. The human
adrenal autoantigen(s) has/have been localised to the microsomal fraction of
adrenal tissue homogenates and in 1988 it was shown that the antigen is a
membrane protein with a molecular weight of about 55,00011. In 1990 there was
described an assay to detect binding of adrenal autoantibodies to subcellular
fractions of the human adrenal gland8. The assay indicated that the autoantibody
has a plasma membrane and/or microsomal source and was described as providing 
a more rational approach to "eventual" antigen isolation and purification.Measurement of adrenal autoantibodies is important in the diagnosis of
Addison's disease and currently immunofluorescence is used routinely.The present inventor has for the first time succeeded in isolating and
characterising an adrenal antigen. The isolation and characterisation of the
antigen enables the production of the antigen, for example, by recombinant
techniques, the generation of antibodies to the antigen, purification of adrenal
autoantibody and assays for the antigen. Such assays are useful for the
diagnosis of latent or actual autoimmune Addison's
