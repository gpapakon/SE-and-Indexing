<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to apparatus (10) and methods for loading groups of battery plates or the like in adjacent cells (1 to 6) in a holder. The apparatus includes guide means (13) which defines, by means of walls (37, 38), spaces (40) for receiving respective battery groups (30). The walls can be collapsed around the groups (30) in the spaces (40) until the position and spacing corresponds to that of a row of cells (1 to 3), in which point in the groups are pushed through the guide means (13) into the respective cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
loading groups of battery plates or the like in adjacent 
cells in a holder. During the manufacture of industrial and vehicle 
batteries, it is necessary to insert groups of plates into 
cells within a battery box. It can also be necessary to 
insert groups of plates into processing and manufacturing 
equipment. In many batteries the cells in the box or other 
holder are arranged side by side and it has been found that 
it is possible to insert the plates, simultaneously, into 
alternate cells using a guide defining a series of chutes. 
The guide is necessary because the plates are a very tight 
fit in the cell and often spread a little when gripped, thus 
making insertion difficult. By loading alternate cells it 
is possible for each chute to extend over the adjacent cell 
which has not been filled. Such an arrangement is shown in 
our U.S. Patent No. 4887350. There are other batteries, such as truck batteries, in 
which the cells are arranged in two side by side groups of 
three and in this case alternate cell filling is at best a 
lengthy procedure and at worst impossible because of the 
forces which would be applied to the interces of the cells. The present invention is intended to overcome the 
problem of battery boxes or other holders having this 
configuration, but it will be understood that it is  
 
applicable to any arrangement of cells. From one aspect the invention consists in apparatus for 
loading groups of battery plates or the like in adjacent 
cells having a common midplane in a holder, comprising guide means for defining 
adjacent spaces, each having a greater cross-section than a 
cell, means for inserting the groups in respective ones of 
the spaces, means for contracting the guide means 
and for adjusting the spacing of the groups so that 
the spaces substantially correspond in size and relative 
position with the cells, means for inserting the guide means 
in the cells with the groups in the spaces, and means for 
inserting the groups into the respective cells. In a preferred embodiment, the means for inserting the 
groups in the spaces and the means for inserting the groups 
into the cells are the same and they may comprise means for 
gripping the sides of the groups and further independent 
means for holding and/or pushing the upper end of the 
groups. From another aspect the invention consists in a method 
for loading groups of battery plates in adjacent cells in a 
holder, comprising inserting the groups in adjacent spaces

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for loading groups of battery plates (37a) 
or the like in adjacent cells (1,2,3 or 4,5,6) having a 

common mid-plane in a holder, comprising guide means (13) 
for defining adjacent spaces (40) each having a greater 

cross-section than a cell (1 to 6), means (22) for 
inserting the groups in respective ones of the spaces (40), 

means (44) for contracting the guide means (13) and for 
adjusting the spacing of the groups so that the spaces 

substantially correspond in size and relative position 
with the cells, means for inserting the guide means (13) in 

the cells (1 to 6) with the groups in the spaces and means 
(22) for inserting the groups into respective cells. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means 
(22) for inserting the groups into the spaces and the means 

for inserting the groups into the cells are the same. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein 
the group inserting means (22) comprise means (27) for 

gripping the sides of the groups and further independent 
means (26a) for holding and/or pushing the upper end of the 

groups. 
A method for loading groups of battery plates (37a) 
in adjacent cells (1,2,3 or 4,5,6) in a holder comprising 

inserting the groups within adjacent spaces (40) defined by 
a guide means (13), each of the spaces having a greater 

cross section than a corresponding cell (1 to 6), contacting 
the guide means (13) around the groups and adjusting the  

 
spacing of the groups so that the spaces (40) substantially 

corresponding in size and relative position with the cells 
(1 to 6), inserting the guide means (13) in the cells (1 to) 

with the groups in the spaces (40) and inserting the groups 
into the respective cells (1,2,3 or 4,5,6). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 as 
dependant on claim 2 wherein the group inserting means 

compromise at least two gripping means each for gripping a 
respective group, the means for adjusting the spacing 

include means for mounting the gripping means for movement 
towards each other along the plane, and the group inserting 

including means for moving the gripping means through the 
guide means to load the groups into their respective cells. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 or 
5 wherein the guide means includes wall means (37) defining 

a series of guide spaces (40) for receiving the groups. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein the wall 
means includes a first set of the walls (37) lying generally 

orthogonally to the mid-plane and being mounted for 
contraction towards each other generally along the line of 

the plane. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7 wherein 
the wall means include a second set of walls (38) lying 

generally parallel to the plane and being mounted for 
contraction by rotating inwardly into the space (40) about 

respective axes extending generally parallel to the plane. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 7 or 8 
wherein the first set and/or second set of walls are mounted  

 
on a pair of rails (35) extending generally parallel to and 

on either side of plane. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 9 further including 
spacer means (34) mounted on the rails for defining the 

closest approach of the walls of the first set one to 
another. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10 
wherein the second set of walls have associated cams (45) 

for moving them from their expanded position to their 
contracted position. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 or 
5 to 12 comprising a pair of supports (15,16) each carrying 

at least two gripping means and each being movable between 
a pick-up location (14) and a holder location (17) for 

cooperating with the guide means to load successive sets of 
adjacent cells.
