<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a shock absorber arrangement which comprises a shock
absorber combined with a wheel suspension fitting and which is arranged for active
wheel suspension/shock absorbing in a wheel suspension of a vehicle, as disclosed
in DE-A-2920185, and corresponding to the preamble of
claim 1.In order to ensure good road characteristics and good travelling comfort (comfortable
driving) for a vehicle equipped with wheels, such as an automobile, and in the
special case of travelling on rough surfaces and when driving around bends, the vehicle
must be provided with a well functioning system of wheel suspension, shock
absorbers and springs. The springs provide elastic resistance through storing energy
when they are pressed together, and this energy is damped away at least partially
by means of shock absorbers which brake the relative movement between the bodywork
of the vehicle and the wheel suspension and convert the spring energy to heat.Especially between the front wheels of the vehicle, but sometimes also between its
rear wheels, there is usually some type of stabilizer which prevents excessive rolling
(leaning to the side) of the bodywork when driving around bends. A usual type of
stabilizer is a twist or torsion spring in the shape of a torsion rod which is rotatably
mounted to the car body/chassis/base plate and which extends transversely to the
longitudinal axis of the car. The ends of the torsion rod are connected to the wheel
suspension by lever arms and follow their suspension movements. With differently
sized suspension movements of the wheels connected together through the stabilizer
the stabilizer counteracts the leaning of the bodywork when driving around corners
outwards in the curve and presses the inner, lighter loaded wheel against the road
surface. The outer, more heavily loaded wheel at the same time gets stiffer springing
which together leads to reduced lean and thereby improved road characteristics.A wheel suspension system with active springs can regulate both the spring function
and the damping function of the wheels. A plurality of different constructive solutions
concerning such systems are known in the prior art. Sensors can be included in 
these systems which sense, for example, the vertical wheel load, the movement of
the wheel and acceleration, respectively.Signals from the sensors are normally transmitted to an electronic control unit which
controls and influences the characteristics of the constituent components in the
wheel suspension system, such as springs,
