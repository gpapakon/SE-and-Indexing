<ABSTRACT>
The seat of the chair is divided up into a front, forwardly descending and a rear, forwardly ascending region (6 and 7 respectively). The backrest (2) is left open in the gluteal region and supports the sitting person in the thoracic region (23). The width of the seat decreases forwardly and that of the backrest upwardly. A person who sits on the chair automatically assumes an ergonomically correct sitting position. The legs (20) are slightly angled, the pelvis is tilted forwards, the thorax is upright and the spinal column is optimally loaded. The shoulder blades are free.
