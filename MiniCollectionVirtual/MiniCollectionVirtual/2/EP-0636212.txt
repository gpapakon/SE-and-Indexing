<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes that the head of water normally used in conventional hydraulic power stations in a single stage be divided all the time into several partial stages, each consisting of a pressure pipe and a turbine with a current generator. The undersigned is convinced, on the basis of physical considerations, that a considerably increased electric power production can be attained.

<CLAIMS>
Multi-stage hydraulic power station, which for an available height having 
several turbines each with a generator, characterised in that the available height is 

divided in several partial stages, whereby after each partial stage a turbine with a 
generator and a collector tank for the water leaving the turbine between two partial 

stages are provided. 
Multi-stage hydraulic power station according to claim 1, characterised in that at 
each partial stage due to the disposition of the collector tank, the water is again braked 

to the velocity zero.
