<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a semiconductor 
device inspection system improved in measurement accuracy 

and in operability. A semiconductor device is observed 
from the bottom surface side. First, image data obtained 

upon image pickup under infrared illumination is 
converted into first left-to-right-reversed image data 

corresponding to a left-to-right-reversed image and the 
first reversed image data is stored. Then an image is 

obtained under no illumination from very weak light 
emitted from an abnormal portion when a bias is applied to 

the semiconductor device. Image data of the very weak 
light image is then converted into second left-to-right-reversed 

image data corresponding to a left-to-right-reversed 
image. The first and second left-to-right-reversed 

image data is superimposedly added to each other 
and a superimposed image is displayed with the abnormal 

portion being superimposed on a chip pattern as seen from 
the top surface of the semiconductor device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device inspection system used for example, in anomaly
occurrence analysis or reliability evaluation of
semiconductor devices. More particularly, the invention
relates to a semiconductor device inspection system for
detecting from the bottom surface side very weak light in
the infrared region as emitted from an anomalous portion
in a semiconductor device.With an increase in integration of semiconductor
devices, internal circuits tend to become finer and more
complicated, which results in making difficult the
detailed anomaly occurrence analysis or reliability
evaluation of internal circuits.In such an existing state, much attention is focused
on the analysis technology to track down the location of
an anomalous portion by detecting very weak light emitted
from the anomalous portion in semiconductor device. An
emission microscope is known as a semiconductor device
inspection apparatus utilizing such analysis technology.The emission microscope picks up with high
sensitivity very weak light as caused by hot carriers, 
which are produced when an electric field is concentrated
on an anomalous portion in semiconductor device, or very
weak light in the infrared region as caused by
recombination for example in latchup. Therefore, the
emission microscope has an excellent function to inspect
a semiconductor device to be checked with no contact and
with high accuracy while being superior in operability.The emission microscope, however, had the following
problem. Since it detects emission in the visible to
infrared region, it could become incapable of measuring
emission if there exists some shielding object between an
anomalous portion emitting very weak light and the
emission microscope.Specifically, highly integrated devices such as VLSI
semiconductor devices tend to employ the chip structure
in which interconnection between numerous elements such
as transistors is made by multilayer wiring located on
the top surface side. The multilayer wiring is likely to
interrupt the very weak light caused by an anomaly of an
element underneath the multilayer wiring, which caused a
problem of inability of measurement or not permitting
high-accuracy measurement. Also, a semiconductor device
to which the packaging structure as called as Lead On Chip
is applied has such an arrangement that a lead frame
covers the top of semiconductor chip. Thus, similarly as
in the case of the multilayer wiring, the lead frame will 
be a shielding object to interrupt the very weak light, resulting
