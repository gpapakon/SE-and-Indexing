<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wire and cable 
and the insulation and jacketing therefor and, more 
particularly, to telephone cable. A typical telephone cable is constructed 
of twisted pairs of metal conductors for signal 
transmission. Each conductor is insulated with a 
polymeric material. The desired number of 
transmission pairs is assembled into a circular 
cable core, which is protected by a cable sheath 
incorporating metal foil and/or armor in combination 
with a polymeric jacketing material. The sheathing 
protects the transmission core against mechanical 
and, to some extent, environmental damage. Of particular interest are the grease-filled 
telephone cables. These cables were 
developed in order to minimize the risk of water 
penetration, which can severely upset electrical 
signal transmission quality. A watertight cable 
is provided by filling the air spaces in the cable 
interstices with a hydrocarbon cable filler grease. 
While the cable filler grease extracts a portion of 
the antioxidants from the insulation, the watertight 
cable will not exhibit premature oxidative failure 
as long as the cable maintains its integrity. In the cable transmission network, however, 
junctions of two or more watertight cables are 
required and this joining is often accomplished  
 
in an outdoor enclosure known as a pedestal (an 
interconnection box). Inside the pedestal, the 
cable sheathing is removed, the cable filler 
grease is wiped off, and the transmission wires 
are interconnected. The pedestal with its now 
exposed insulated wires is usually subjected to 
a severe environment, a combination of high 
temperature, air, and moisture. This environment 
together with the depletion by extraction of those 
antioxidants presently used in grease-filled cable 
can cause the insulation in the pedestal to exhibit 
premature oxidative failure. In its final stage, 
this failure is reflected in oxidatively embrittled 
insulation prone to cracking and flaking together 
with a loss of electrical transmission performance. To counter the depletion of antioxidants, 
it has been proposed to add high levels of 
antioxidants to the polymeric insulation. However, 
this not only alters the performance characteristics 
of the insulation, but is economically unsound in 
view of the high cost of antioxidants. There is a 
need, then, for antioxidants which will resist cable 
filler grease extraction to the extent necessary to 
prevent premature oxidative failure and ensure the 
30 to 40 year service life desired by industry.
