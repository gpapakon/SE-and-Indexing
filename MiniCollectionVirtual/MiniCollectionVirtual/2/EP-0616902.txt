<ABSTRACT>
The binder contains, at its upper and lower ends, one holder (3) in each case into which clips (9) are inserted which hold the document (10) in the joint. The resilient clips (9) are displaceable transversely to the longitudinal direction of the spine and are retained by a rib (7). The holders (3) are provided with fixing tabs (6), which are riveted to the spine (1) of the binder. These fixing tabs (6) project beyond the central web (4) of the holders (3) in the longitudinal direction of the spine. In order to prevent the clips (9) from falling out laterally, inward-projecting locking members (22) are provided.

<CLAIMS>
A binder for the exchangeable filing of printed 
matter such as magazines or brochures with holding 

devices (3) provided on either ends of the back 
for receiving resilient clamps (9) each provided 

with a handle element (12), with the holding 
devices (3) each having a plane middle bridge (4) 

serving as bearing surface for the printed matter 
and side legs (5) projecting therefrom at an angle 

and the clamps (9) engaging from either end into 
the printed matter, and in the course thereof each 

grasp below the middle bridge (4) of the holding 
devices (3) and are freely displaceable in the 

transverse direction of the back, the middle 
bridge (4) having a recess (7) facing the back 

(1), with the shape of the clamps (9) being 
adjusted to the recess (7) for the detachable 

fixing of the clamps (9) in the inserted position 
and the clamps (9) snapping in behind the recess 

(7) during the insertion in their end position 
under their spring effect, characterized in that 

from the side legs (5) there project one each of a 
fastening lug (6) being provided for resting 

against the back of the binder or for projecting 
jointly on either side beyond the middle bridge 

(4) in the longitudinal direction of the back and 
that blocking bodies (22) are each provided in the 

zone of the edges between the side walls (5) and 
the middle bridge (4) for limiting the lateral 

path of movement of the clamps (9). 
A binder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fastening bridge connects the side 

legs (5) in one piece.  
 
A binder as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the side legs (5) mutually form an acute 

angle and open towards the side averted from the 
back (1), and the connecting edge each being 

directly adjacent between the side leg (5) and the 
fastening lug (6) or fastening bridge to the fold 

of the binder (20) between the back (1) and the 
lids (2). 
A binder as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that between the end of the 

handle element (12) of the clamp (9) on the side 
of the printed matter and an edge (11) which is 

upwardly bent at the edge of the middle bridge (4) 
and acting as a stop for the printed matter (10) 

there is a distance (a), preferably of approx. 1 
to 3 mm. 
A binder as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the holding devices (3) 

consist of metal and the blocking bodies (22) are 
tongues (22) bent out of the material of the side 

legs (5). 
A binder as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the holding devices (3) 

consist of plastic and the blocking bodies (22) 
are bulge-lake enlargements. 
A binder as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the clamp leg (17) intended 

for engaging into the printed matter is longer 
than the leg intended for engaging in the hollow 

space (24). 
A holding device for producing a binder as claimed 
in one of the claims 1 to 7.
