<ABSTRACT>
An assembly and method of assembly for shielding a radio telephone. First and
second shields are disposed either side of a circuit board and urged together

thereby sandwiching the circuit board. The first shield is relatively rigid
compared to the second shield and can cause any deformities in the second

shield to be compensated for by the second shield being urged against a rigid
first shield. the shields may be removably coupled together which permits

simple and quick disassembly if changes or repairs need to be made to the radio
telephone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a housing for a radio telephone, in particular a housing which inhibits electromagnetic radiation and which may be used in a wide number of portable radio telephones.Radio telephones are required by law to adhere to Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) limits as laid down in Type Approval specifications for Mobile Phones. EMC is defined as the ability of a device to function properly in its intended electromagnetic environment and to not be a source of electromagnetic pollution to that environment.To enable electronic apparatus to be electromagnetically compatible, electromagnetic (EM) shielding is often placed within the apparatus to reduce the radiation emissions from radiating sources and to reduce the levels of radiation reaching sensitive components.In known radio telephone designs interfering electronic circuits are segregated onto a number of circuit boards. The circuit boards are located in spaces within the frame structure of the telephone which are separated by high partitions to inhibit unwanted EM radiation passing between the circuits. The frame structure tends to be relatively large and generally forms part of the outer surface of the telephone.In other known radio telephone designs the EM shielding of the electronic circuits is implemented using either metal casings or metallized plastic casings fixed onto a circuit board by soldering. A drawback of this design is that the inspection and repair of soldered electronic components is blocked by the presence of the EM shield casings. To overcome this drawback the EM shield casing is de-soldered, inspection and repair performed on the soldered electronic components, then the casing is re-soldered onto the circuit board.In the US patent 5687470 a frame structure of a radio phone is disclosed in which the frame comprises a substantially conducting frame plate, whereby the frame plate together with the ground foil of the circuit board forms the EMC shielding for the components located on the side of the circuit board facing the frame plate.In the US patent 5271056 a method is disclosed for producing a sealing compound to secure an EM shield case on to a circuit board thus preventing radio frequency. (RF) radiation or conducting electricity on the case from disturbing other components in the telephone. The patent application also discloses a method for installing a circuit board to be RF shielded for example on the frame of a radio telephone.Furthermore, US patent 5014160 discloses a shielding method and apparatus

<CLAIMS>
An assembly for a radio telephone comprising a substantially planar support member (7), and first and second shielding members (6, 8) for respectively shielding first and second major surfaces of the support member, the support member (7) being disposed between the first and second shielding members (6, 8), 
characterized in that
 the first shielding member (6) is rigid relative to the second shielding member (8) and is coupled to the second shielding member and said second shielding member (8) is elastic such that the first and second shielding members are urged against respective first and second major surfaces of the support member (7) and through the elasticity of the second shielding member (8) the second shielding member conforms to the contours of the support member (7) upon being urged thereto, and wherein at least one of the first and second shielding members is provided with a rib (28-35) of engaging with a receiving member on the other shielding member to ensure electrical contact between the first and second shielding members.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first and second shielding members (6, 8) are removably coupled together.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one of the first and second shielding members (6, 8) includes a wall depending therefrom towards the support member (7).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the shielding members (6, 8) are electrically conductive to inhibit the passage of electromagnetic radiation.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one of the first and second shielding members (6, 8) has guiding means (14-17, 23) for aligning the shielding members with the planar support member (7).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first and second shielding members (6, 8) are coupled together by snap type fittings (12, 13, 22).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first and second shielding members (6, 8) are coupled together by screw fittings (24-27).

A method of assembling a housing for a radio telephone, comprising:

disposing a first shielding member (6) to a first major surface of a substantially planar support member (7);
disposing a second elastic shielding member (8) to a second major surface of the substantially planar support member (7);
coupling the first and second shielding members (6, 8) together thereby sandwiching the support member (7) between said first and second shielding members; and urging the first and second shielding members (6, 8) against respective first and second major surfaces of the support member so as to cause said second shielding member (8) to conform to said second major surface, and wherein the support member (7) has an electrically conductive track for electrically coupling a component supported by the circuit board and shielded by the shielding members with test apparatus disposed outside the shielding to allow testing at any stage in the assembling process.
