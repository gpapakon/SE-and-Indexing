<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for determining the fill level of the circulatory system of a patient, in particular the end diastolic heart volume (GEDV), the intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), the pulmonary blood volume (PBV), the extravasal lung water volume (EVLW) and/or the global cardiac function index (CF) by thermodilution. The intrathoracic thermovolume (ITTV) and the pulmonary thermovolume (PTV) are detected, for example, and the global end diastolic heart volume (GEDV) is determined on the basis of the equation GEDV = ITTV - PTV. The remaining volumes can be calculated on the basis of these parameters, which are specific to the fill level of the heart, and of other species-specific characteristic values (a, a', b, b').

Device for determining the fill level of blood circulation by means of
thermodilution, having a thermodilution measuring arrangement which

comprises a thermodilution injector, a temperature sensor and a control
and evaluation apparatus, at which the output values of the temperature

sensor and further measuring parameters lie and which from the

thermodilution curve forms the intrathoracic thermovolume ITTV
TDART
 and
the pulmonary thermovolume PTV
TDart
 according to the following
equations:


ITTV
TDART
 = C.O.
TDart
 x MTT
TDart
 and
PTV
TDart
 = C.O.
TDart
 x DST
TDart,

in which C.O.
TDart
 is the cardiac output, which is determined according to
the Standard-Stuart-Hamilton formula in its adaptation to thermodilution.

MTT
TDart
 is the mean transit time and DST
TDart
 denotes the exponential fall
time, characterised in that the control and evaluation apparatus comprises

a differential unit, at which the values ITTV
TDart

global end diastolic volume of the heart GEDV
TDart
, which represents the
sum of the cardiac chamber volumes without the volume of the lungs.
Device for determining the fill level of blood circulation by means of
thermodilution, having a thermodilution measuring arrangement which
