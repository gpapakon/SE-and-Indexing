<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oil-water emulsion formation 
apparatus especially for use for a diesel engine. It is generally known that NOx components in an exhaust 
gas can be reduced and an engine knock can be prevented by 
lowering the combustion temperature inside cylinders by feeding 
a fuel comprising an emulsion of a fuel oil and water to a 
Diesel engine. Various methods and apparatuses have also been proposed as 
the apparatus for forming the emulsion of the fuel oil and 
water. For preparing such an emulsion it is already known (EP 0 
392 545 A1) to use a rotationally symmetric vortex chamber in 
the Form of a hollow pear having a tangential inlet and a 
tapering axial outlet, the vortex chamber being surroundet by a 
ring channel into which an oil inlet passage opens in 
tangential direction and which in turn is connected to the 
vortex chamber via tangential inlet slots. The water is jetted 
by a water jet nozzle into the ring channel or the vortex 
chamber. The tapering outlet of the vortex chamber opens via a 
stepped enlargement into the suction chamber of a radial-flow 
pump comprising a radial-flow pump impeller in a pump chamber 
and an emulsion outlet passage extending in parallel with the 
axis of the impeller and directing the prepared emulsion to the 
injection pump and into a recycling inlet passage, which in 
turn is tangentially opening into the ring channel. It is 
reached by the recycling of the emulsion into the vortex 
chamber and by the sudden enlargement at the outlet of the 
vortex chamber and by the change of direction of the flow at 
the exit of the radial-flow impeller, that an emulsion with an 
average droplet size of 2 to 4 micron are formed, whereby a 
fine and homogeneous emulsion results being well suitable for 
the operation of diesel engines. By using an electromagnetic 
water injection nozzle the water content of the emulsion can be 
controlled in dependence on the operating state of the diesel 
engine. By the invention the problem is solved to provide for a 
constructionally simpler apparatus ensuring nevertheless a good  
 
emulsion formation. This is achieved according to the invention by an oil-water 
emulsion formation apparatus as described in the claims. Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing an embodiment of an 
emulsion formation apparatus. Fig. 2 is a bottom view of the portion A of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a plan view of the portion B of Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a side view of the portion B of Fig. 1. An embodiment of the emulsion formation apparatus of the 
present

an inlet chamber (37) having the shape of rotation 
symmetry; 
an oil inlet passage (38) and a recycling charging passage 
(39) opening into said inlet chamber in a tangential direction; 
a water jet nozzle (40) disposed at one of the ends of 
said inlet chamber in an axial direction, subjected to electric 

opening/closing control, and jetting water into said inlet 
chamber; 
a pump chamber (33) formed at the other end of said inlet 
chamber in the axial direction; 
a pump impeller (35) having a radial shape, fitted 
coaxially with the axis of said inlet chamber inside said pump 

chamber and being surrounded by a cylindrical wall (34) 
of said pump chamber along the outer periphery of said pump 

impeller, said pump impeller being driven for rotation by a 
driving source; 
a notch portion (41) formed in said wall of the 
said pump chamber ;

the axis of rotation of said pump impeller in the proximity of 

the end portion of said notch portion at the downstream side in 
the rotating direction of said pump impeller; and 
a terminal end wall (42) for intercepting the emulsion 
flow flowing inside said notch portion in the rotating 

direction of said pump impeller.

claim 1, wherein the terminal end wall (42) surrounding the 

outflow port (43) of the emulsion outlet (44) has a 
semincyl
indrical shape and ends in a sharp edge (49) at its radially 
inner end. 
An oil-water emulsion formation apparatus according to 
claim 1 or 2, wherein the flat bottom (46) of the notch  

 
portion is inclined in such a way that the depth of the notch 

portion increases toward the outflow port (43) of the emulsion 
outlet (44). 
An oil-water emulsion formation apparatus according to 
any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the notch portion (41) extends 

along a center angle of the impeller (35) of about 60Â°. 
Use of the oil-water emulsion formation apparatus 
according to any of claims 1 to 4 for supplying the emulsion to 

the injection pump of a diesel engine.
