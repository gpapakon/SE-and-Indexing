<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intermediate useful for 
producing 3,4'-dideoxymycaminosyltylonolide which is an antimicrobial 
substance having an excellent effect of protection from an infection, 
and a process for producing the same. 3,4'-Dideoxymycaminosyltylonolide and salts thereof exhibit an 
antimicrobial activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
microorganisms, and they are usable as antimicrobial agents having 
particularly excellent effect of protection from an infection [see 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Published Application (hereinafter referred 
to as "J. P. KOKAI") No. Hei 2-275894]. 3,4'-Dideoxymycaminosyltylonolide can be produced by protecting 
functional groups of mycaminosyltylonolide which is an acid hydrolyzate 
of tylosin, then converting the hydroxyl groups at the 3-position and 
4'-position into deoxy groups and further removing the protecting 
groups. For converting the hydroxyl group at the 4'-position into deoxy 
group, a known process can be employed, such as a process wherein the 
hydroxyl groups at the 3-position and 4'-position are sulfonylated, 
then the hydroxyl group at the 4' position is halogenated by a method  
 
described in J. Antibiotics 34, 1981, pages 1374 to 1376 or J. P. KOKAI No. 
Hei 2-191295 and the halogen atom is removed by reduction with 
tributyltin hydride. The sulfonic acid can be eliminated from the 
hydroxyl group at the 3-position to form a double bond, which is 
catalytically reduced to form the deoxy compound. However, the above-described process for producing 3,4'-dideoxymycaminosyltylonolide 
has a defect in that the yield of the 
intended product is low, since the conversion of the hydroxy groups at 
the 3-position and 4'-position into deoxy group necessitates the 
following steps: sulfonylating both hydroxyl groups; halogenating the 
hydroxyl group at the 4'-position and removing the halogen atom by 
reduction with tributyltin hydride; and forming double bond by 
eliminating sulfonyloxy group at the 3-position and reducing the double 
bond. In addition, tributyltin hydride used for forming the deoxy 
group at the 4'-position has an offensive odor to make the purification 
of the reaction product difficult. Thus problems are posed when this 
reaction is employed on an industrial scale. Such types of process and/or antibiotic tylosin derivatives 
are disclosed in GB-A-2 081 711, EP-A-0 347 158, 
EP-A-0 132 895, EP-A-0 154 495, 
EP-A-0 104 028 and JP-A-2-191 295. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a 
useful
