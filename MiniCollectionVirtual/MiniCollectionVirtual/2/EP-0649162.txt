<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flat display screen of the type including a micropoint electron emission cathode organised in columns (3), a grid organised in rows (L) and an anode provided with a luminophor element (8) which are arranged in groups (13, 14) of juxtaposed bands which are electrically insulated from each other, the intersection of a row (L) of the grid and a column (3) of the cathode defining a pixel of the screen; the groups (13, 14) of bands (8) of the anode are electrically connected in two networks, a first network comprising the groups (13) of bands of odd rank (R1, V1, B1), whereas a second network comprises the groups (14) of bands of even rank (R2, V2, B2); and the screen is associated with control electronics capable of sequentially addressing the groups of odd rank and even rank, respectively.

A flat panel display including a cathode (11) 
with microtips (10) for emitting electrons, arranged in 

columns (3), a gate (5) arranged in rows (L), and an 
anode (12) provided with phosphor elements (8) arranged 

in groups (13, 14) of juxtaposed strips, electrically 
insulated one from the other, the intersection of a 

gate row and of a cathode column defining a pixel of 
the display, characterized in that the groups (13, 14) 

of strips are electrically connected to form two 
networks, a first network including groups of strips of 

odd rank (R1, V1, B1; I), while a second network 
includes the groups of strips of even rank (R2, V2, B2; 

P); and in that it comprises an electronic control system 
adapted to sequentially address the groups of odd 

row, and even row, respectively. 
The flat panel display of claim 1, characterized 
in that the groups (13, 14) of phosphor strips (8) are 

parallel with the cathode columns and have a width 
substantially identical to the width of said columns 

(3). 
The flat panel display of claim 2, characterized 
in that the cathode columns are individually addressed 

by the electronic control system in two networks 
corresponding to the connection networks of the groups 

(13, 14) of anode strips (12). 
The flat panel display of claim 3, characterized 
in that the electronic control system includes an 

inverter for inverting the addressing of the connection 
networks of groups (13, 14) of phosphor strips (8). 
The flat panel display of claim 1, characterized 
in that the groups (13, 14) of phosphor strips (8) are  

 
parallel with the gate (5) rows (L) and have a width 

substantially identical to the width of said rows. 
The flat panel display of claim 5, characterized 
in that the electronic control system includes means 

for sequentially addressing the gate rows of even rank, 
respectively odd rank, simultaneously with addressing 

the groups (13, 14) of phosphor strips (8) of even 
rank, respectively odd rank. 
The flat panel display of any of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that each of said groups (13, 14) is 
constituted by a phosphor strip (I, P), the phosphor 

elements (8) of all the groups being of a same type. 
The flat panel display of any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that each of said groups (13, 14) 

comprises three strips (R, V, B) of phosphor elements 
(8) of different colors, each network including three 

sets (R1, V1, B1; R2, V2, B2) of phosphor strips, the 
strips being electrically interconnected, and the electronic 

control system including means for individually 
addressing each set of a same network.
