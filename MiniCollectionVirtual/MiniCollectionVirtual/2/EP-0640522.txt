<ABSTRACT>
A foundation system for tension leg platforms without 
use of foundation templates, wherein each tendon (5) is 

directly connected to a socket (9) inside the pile (8), 
said piles (8) being positioned for driving purpose by 

means of a pile-driving template (10) which is employed as 
a spacing device. The pile-driving template (10) is 

positioned with the aid of pins (11) that slot into guides 
(7) built into the well template (6). After the groups of 

piles (8) needed to anchor a corner of the platform (1) 
have been driven in, the pile-driving template (10) is 

withdrawn and repositioned so as to enable the piles for 
the other group of legs to be driven; this process 

continues until all of the pile-driving is finished. 
Alternatively one single pile-driving template (16) may be 

employed to guide the driving of all the piles (8), thus 
doing away with the need to reposition the template every 

time. The bottom ends (14) of the piles are conical in 
shape, and after the piles have been driven they are filled 

up with some high specific gravity ballast material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a foundation system for 
tension leg platforms where tendons are anchored directly 
to sockets fitted inside the piles thereby doing away with 
the need to make use of rigid structures known as 
foundation templates. Various kinds of anchoring pile systems for tension 
leg platforms (TLPs) are known. In all of them transfer of 
the anchored load to the piles is achieved by means of a 
structure at the sea bottom, known as a foundation 
template. This template has cylindrically shaped guides 
into which are driven tubular piles which are fixed to the 
foundation template either by cementing the annular space 
between the cylindrically shaped guide and the pile, or by 
deforming the steel of the pile with the aid of a tool 
which expands it against the guide, thereby bringing about 
a mechanical connection between the pile and the guide. US-A-4,620,820 illustrates a foundation system such 
as the one described above and discloses equipment and an 
anchoring system for a tension leg platform anchored to the 
sea bottom by means of an anchoring assembly made up of 
upper and lower parts. The upper part thereof is tied to 
the bottom ends of the tendons forming the tension legs of 
the tension leg platform. The upper part of the anchoring 
assembly serves to space out and to line up each tendon, 
keeping them straight when the upper part of the assembly 
is joined to the lower part which has first of all been 
fixed to the sea bottom by means of the piles. The foundation templates have to withstand cycles of 
heavy strain and must therefore be designed to withstand 
the ensuing fatigue which inevitably leads to their being 
sturdily and heavily built, thereby increasing the 
anchoring cost. Another critical point is that the joining  
 
of piles to the templates is prone to failure. The invention described and claimed herein introduces 
significant modifications in such a system, does away with 
the need for templates in the foundations, cuts down on the 
cost of anchoring, and considerably reduces the likelihood 
of failure since there are fewer mechanical parts. For the purpose of principally doing away with the 
need for foundation templates, thus diminishing the cost of 
materials and the installation costs, this invention 
provides a tension leg platform foundation system wherein 
each tendon is directly connected to its pile by means of a 
socket fitted into the pile, the piles being driven in with 
the aid of a template which also serves to keep the piles 
apart from the
