<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous production of substantially purified lactide and lactide polymers from lactide acid or an ester of lactic acid including the steps of forming crude polylactic acid, preferably in the presence of a catalyst means in the case of the ester of lactic acid, to form a condensation reaction by-product and polylactic acid, and depolymerizing the polylactic acid to form crude lactide, followed by subsequent purification of the crude lactide in a distillation system. A purified lactide is then polymerized to form lactide polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF LACTIDE AND LACTIDE POLYMERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION I. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to processes for the continuous production of lactide and lactide polymers from crude lactic acid and esters of lactic acid in the field of biodegradable polymers. 2. Description of the Prior ArtThe continued depletion of landfill space and the problems associated with incineration of waste have led to the need for development of truly biodegradable polymers to be utilized as substitutes for non- biodegradable or partially biodegradable, petrochemical- based polymers. The use of lactic acid and lactide to manufacture a biodegradable polymer is well known in the medical industry. As disclosed by Nieuwenhuis et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,053,485), such polymers have 'been used for making biodegradable sutures, clamps, bone plates and biologically active controlled release devices. It will be appreciated that processes developed for the manufacture of polymers to be utilized in the medical industry have incorporated techniques which respond to the need for high purity and bioco patibility in the final polymer product. Furthermore, the processes were designed to produce small volumes of high dollar-value products, with less emphasis on manufacturing cost and yield. It is believed that prior to Applicants' development, viable, cost-competitive processes for the continuous manufacture of purified lactide and lactide polymers from lactic acid having physical properties suitable for replacing present petrochemical-based polymers in packaging, paper coating and other non-medical industry applications were unknown.It is known that lactic acid undergoes a condensation reaction to form polylactic acid when water 

is removed by evaporation or other means. The overall polymerization reaction is represented by:0 0 0 0 « I!

As the polylactic acid chain lengthens, the polymerization reaction rate decelerates until it reaches the rate of the
