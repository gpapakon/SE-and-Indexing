<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lubricant compositions, and
more particularly to lubricants and additive concentrates of
enhanced performance characteristics.Over the years the demand for performance improvements
in lubricating oils and functional fluids has persisted and,
if anything, progressively increased. For example, lubricating
oils for use in internal combustion engines, and in
particular, in spark-ignition and diesel engines, are constantly
being modified and improved to provide improved performance.
Various organizations around the world as well as
the automotive manufacturers continually seek to improve the
performance of lubricating oils. Various standards have
been established and modified over the years through the efforts
of these organizations. As engines have increased in
power output and complexity, and in many cases decreased in
size, the performance requirements have been increased to
provide lubricating oils that will exhibit a reduced tendency
to deteriorate under conditions of use and thereby to
reduce wear and the formation of such undesirable deposits
as varnish, sludge, carbonaceous materials and resinous
materials which tend to adhere to various engine parts and
reduce the operational efficiency of the engine.An objective therefore is to provide novel compositions
capable of effectively controlling wear and formation of undesirable
quantities of such varnish, sludge, and carbonaceous
deposits.Flexible engine seals are used in assembling internal
combustion engines and drivetrains to prevent leakage of
lubricants at locations where moving parts, such as crank-case
shafts, extend outside the engine block. Accordingly,
qualification tests have been established whereby the effect 
of a lubricant composition on a given seal-type material is
measured under a particular set of controlled laboratory
bench test conditions. The commercial reality is that the
lubricant needs to exhibit good performance in a variety of
elastomer compatibility tests to achieve acceptance in the
marketplace. Thus another objective is to provide compositions
capable of passing such seal compatibility tests.U.S. Pat. No. 5,080,815 to Fenoglio et al describes
dispersants having improved compatibility toward a particular
fluoroelastomer. Those dispersants are formed by reacting
a hydrocarbyl-substituted dicarboxylic acid compound
such as a hydrocarbyl-substituted dicarboxylic acid anhydride
with aminoguanidine or a basic salt thereof in a ratio
of about 1.5 to about 2.2 moles of aminoguanidine or basic
salt thereof
