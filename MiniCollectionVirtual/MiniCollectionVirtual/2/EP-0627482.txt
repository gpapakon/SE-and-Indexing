<ABSTRACT>
Waste materials which contain organic constituents difficult to grind are reacted by autothermic gasification with an oxygen-containing gasifying agent at temperatures above the melting point of the mineral and metallic constituents of the waste materials, above at least 1200@C, the gasification products formed being a CO- and H2-containing fuel gas, which is free of aromatic, polycyclic, heterocyclic or halogenated hydrocarbons, and a slag which has solidified from the melt and can virtually not be leached by water. The waste material to be gasified is rendered brittle by shock cooling with an inert cold carrier, is comminuted in this state and then introduced into the gasification reactor.

Method for the utilisation of waste materials, which contain organic components, by
autothermic gasification by a gasification agent, which contains oxygen, at temperatures

above the melting point of the mineral and metallic components of the waste materials, at
least above 1200Â°C, wherein a combustible gas, which contains CO and H
2
 and is free of
aromatic, polycyclic, heterocyclic or halogenated hydrocarbons, and a slag, which is

solidified from the melt and is virtually non-soluble, arise as gasification product,
characterised thereby that the waste material to be gasified is embrittled by a shock-cooling

with an inert cooling agent, is comminuted in this state and subsequently fed into
the gasification reactor.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the embrittled waste
material is comminuted to a grain size required for feeding into the gasification reactor and

to a grain size appropriate to the available dwell time and necessary for the complete
conversion of organic components and the smelting of the mineral and metallic

component.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the embrittlement of the
waste materials is effected by a low-temperature treatment (cryogenics).
Method according to claim 3, characterised thereby that oxygen as gasification
agent is produced in an air separation plant and that nitrogen is used as cooling agent,

which is derived from the cooling circuit of the air separation plant.
Method according to claim 3, characterised thereby that the cooling agent is cooled
down in a separate cooling plant to the required embrittlement temperature for the low-temperature

treatment.
Method according to claim 5, characterised thereby that carbon dioxide is used as
cooling agent, which is se
parated off from the combustible gas produced in the gasification
reactor. 
Method according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterised thereby that the energy
requirement for operation of the cooling plant is met by utilisation of the combustible gas

produced in the gasification reactor.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby that the feeding of
the comminuted waste materials into the gasification reactor is effected by way of a worm

extruder feed and/or a slurry feed and/or a dry powder charging feed.
