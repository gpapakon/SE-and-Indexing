<ABSTRACT>
A separator or a packaging material is provided, 
comprising a thermoplastic plastic film at least one surface of 

which is a matte surface or an embossed surface having a 
surface roughness (Ra) of not larger than 1/2 of the thickness 

of the film. The separator or packaging material is useful as 
a separator for pressure-sensitive adhesive articles and 

disposable articles or as a packaging material for packing 
foods, pressure-sensitive adhesive articles and
 sanitary 
articles. In particular, the separator is suitably used as a 

separator for a disposable diaper and a sanitary napkin, and 
also the packaging material is suitably used as a package for 

a sanitary napkin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separator for
pressure-sensitive adhesive articles such as a pressure-sensitive
adhesive sheet, a (double-sided) pressure-sensitive
adhesive tape, a tack, etc., and for disposable articles such
as a paper diaper, a napkin. etc., or a packaging material
being used for packing foods, pressure-sensitive adhesive
articles such as pressure-sensitive adhesive tacks, etc., and
sanitary articles such as a sanitary napkin, etc. In
particular, the separator of the present invention is suitably
used as a separator for a disposable diaper and a sanitary
napkin and also the packaging material of the present invention
is suitably used as a package for a sanitary napkin.Hitherto, as separators for disposable articles such
as, for example, disposable diapers and napkins and as
packaging materials for sanitary articles such as sanitary
napkins, etc., various materials are used. For example, as a
packaging material for a napkin, a releasing tape and a
packaging material each comprising a substrate composed of a
flexible plastic film having thereon a releasing agent layer
are proposed as described, e.g., in JP-A-3-24949 and JP-A-3-184543
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application"). However, the 
substrates used for the forgoing materials are plastic films
each composed of a single component, such as polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyester, nylon, cellophane, etc., and hence
there is a problem that the substrate is too soft or, to the
contrary, too hard.That is, if the substrate is too soft, the substrate is
stretched or cut in the conveying step in the production line
of napkins, etc., which results in greatly lowering the
productivity. Also, if the substrate is too hard, the product
such as the releasing tape and the packaging material has a
disadvantage that a soft feeling from the point of the
practical use is lost and the releasing sound becomes large to
lower the commercial value thereof.Furthermore, from the productivity, when the release
treatment surface of the film is smooth, the static friction
coefficient and the kinetic friction coefficient become large,
whereby the friction at the contact of the film with rolls in
the step of producing or packaging articles such as pressure-sensitive
adhesive articles and sanitary articles is increased
to fall off the releasing agent and cut the film, which become
the cause of troubles.Furthermore, document WO-A-8201861 discloses a separator comprising a blended
thermoplastic film with a
