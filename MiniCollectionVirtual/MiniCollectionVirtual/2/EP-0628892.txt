<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic brush development 
apparatus (10) for applying developer material to a latent 

image on a moving image carrying member (12) comprises 
a take-off skive (74) wherein 

mounting of a take-off skive is facilitated. The 
development apparatus (10) includes a housing (14) having a 

portion defining a sump (S) adapted to contain a supply of 
developer material, and a magnetic brush (36) located 

within the housing (14) in spaced relation to 
the sump portion (S) for applying developer material to the 

latent image. A feed mechanism (60) including a metering 
assembly (50) located within the housing (14) between the sump 

portion (S) and the magnetic brush (36) transports developer 
material from the sump to the magnetic brush, and a 

mechanism (26) located in the sump portion agitates 
developer material and transports developer material to 

the feed mechanism. A take-off skive (74) for stripping 
development material from the magnetic brush (36) after 

application to a latent image and directing such 
material to the sump portion is mounted so that the 

skive (74) is self-adjustably supported between the metering 
assembly and the magnetic brush. 

Further, developer material in 
the sump portion is replenished by a device which 

includes a reservoir (72) for replenishment material 
adjacent to the sump portion, a flow communication path (18a) 

between the reservoir (72) and the sump portion (S) and a 
selectively rotatable roller (90) located relative to the 

path to control flow of replenishment material through 
the path. Measuring the 

level of replenishment material in the reservoir is 
facilitated by the material monitor (94) located in the 

bottom of the reservoir (72) immediately upstream of the 
flow communication path. Still further, a 

shield (44) is located upstream of the development zone 
between the housing (14) and the image carrying member (12) for 

containing developer material within the development 
zone to substantially prevent escape of airborne 

particulate material from the apparatus (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to 
electrostatographic reproduction apparatus, and more 
particularly to an improved magnetic brush development 
apparatus for an electrostatographic reproduction 
apparatus. Magnetic brush development apparatus for 
applying developer material to a latent image in an 
electrostatographic reproduction apparatus are well 
known in the art. Such apparatus may include a housing 
having a sump portion which contains a supply of 
developer material. When the developer material 
comprises a mixture of magnetic carrier particles and 
smaller pigmented marking particles, the material in 
the sump is agitated to triboelectrically charge the 
material prior to delivering it to a magnetic brush 
where it can be brought into association with, and 
transferred to, an electrostatic latent image to 
develop such image. U.S.-A-4,671,207 discloses a magnetic brush 
development apparatus particularly suitable for use with 
developer material having pigmented marking particles 
and permanent magnetic carrier particles. More 
particularly, the disclosed apparatus include a ribbon 
blender that is used for agitating (mixing), feeding and 
triboelectrically charging such material in the sump 
portion of a magnetic brush development apparatus, and a 
feed mechanism that delivers material from the sump 
portion to a magnetic brush. The material delivered to 
the magnetic brush is applied to the latent 
electrostatic image in a development zone to develop the 
image. The ribbon blender is constructed to provide 
uniform flow distribution of developer material across 
the length of the apparatus so that a sufficient supply  
 
of material is delivered to the magnetic brush over its 
full extent to uniformly develop the entire latent 
electrostatic image. A take-off skive, in contact with 
the magnetic brush downstream of the development zone, 
strips excess developer material from the magnetic brush 
and returns such material to the sump portion. Since the pigmented marking particles are used 
during image development, replenishment of the 
developer material must be periodically effected. 
Typical replenishment devices include a reservoir for 
replenishment material with a flow communication path 
between the reservoir and the sump of the of the 
development apparatus. A selectively actuable member, 
such as a roller, controls flow of replenishment 
material through the path. It has been found that under 
certain conditions the set up latitude between the 
replenishment roller and the flow
