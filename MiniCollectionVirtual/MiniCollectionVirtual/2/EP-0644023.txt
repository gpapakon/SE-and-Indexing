<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for transferring multiple individual 
slices (29) of a food product material from a food material supply 

source (22) which includes a plurality of food product supply 
sources to a support substrate (13) without substantially altering 

the predesignated pattern includes a rotating hollow drum (32) 
disposed on and rotating around a stationary inner core 

member (31). The rotating member (30) is disposed between a slicing 
blade (26) in substrate, negative air pressure is applied to the 

rotating transfer member to cause individual material slices 
to adhere to the outer surface of the transfer member in the 

same pattern in which they are slices from the food supply and 
to leave the outer surface of the transfer member in the same 

pattern thereby permitting, in effect, the "printing" of 
alternating layers of food slices on the substrate. The 

apparatus has particular utility in the production of premade 
food set ups having a plurality of alternating layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
production lines for multiple food product slice assemblies 
and, more particularly, to a food product slice transfer 
apparatus which accurately and reliably transfers multiple 
food product slices which are sliced from a food product 
supply source having multiple "sticks" of food products 
without substantially altering the pattern in which the slices 
are cut from the supply sources. Various devices are known for the transfer of food 
material slices in the food preparation field. Typically, 
such devices are typically concerned with the transfer of 
single slices in a sequential order. A food product transfer 
apparatus which relies upon a vacuum generated from its 
interior to assist it in the transfer of food product slices 
is set forth in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 5,051,268, 
which issued September 24, 1991. This patent describes a 
vacuum-based transfer apparatus for sequentially transferring 
food material strips from a slicer to a substrate by way of a 
rotating drum. The drum has a vacuum drum in its interior 
portion and the negative air pressure resulting therefrom 
causes food product slices to adhere to the outer surface of 
the drum. Positive air pressure is utilized to assist the 
food material strips off of the rotating drum onto a moving 
substrate. However, the apparatus shown in Patent No. 
5,051,268 describes only a single food supply or stick being 
sliced at any given time. Such a transfer apparatus is useful 
in the preparation of sliced packaged products. Conventional Grote slicers are used in production 
lines for slicing one or more "sticks" of a meat product held 
in a reciprocatable food supply storage magazine of the 
slicer. The magazine reciprocates against a cutting blade and  
 
one or more slices of the food product are sliced from the 
food sticks, dependent on the number of food sticks held in 
the supply magazine. One drawback to such a conventional 
slicing system is that the operating speed of the slicer is 
limited to a predetermined, critical speed. At low operating 
speeds, the multiple slices cut from the sticks typically fall 
from the slicer onto a conveyor assembly which may or may not 
contain a support member or substrate, such as waxed paper. 
This type of slicing is sufficient for low operating speeds 
and for instances where the food product sticks are aligned in 
a side-by-side arrangement rather than arranged in multiple 
rows. When operated above a critical speed, it has been 
discovered that food
