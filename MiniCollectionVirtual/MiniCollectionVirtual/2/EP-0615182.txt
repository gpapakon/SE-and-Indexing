<ABSTRACT>
A source/sink current generating circuit is arranged to 
generate source and sink currents which are matched and 

insensitive to fan out. This is achieved by using a biasing 
transistor (Q13) between first and second current mirrors 

which generate respectively the source and sink currents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reference current generating
circuit, capable of providing matched current source and
current sink reference currents.Current generating circuits are well known in the art and in
their simplest form consist of a pair of matched current
mirror transistors, each having a controllable path and a
control node for controlling conduction of the controllable
path. In bipolar technology, the control node is the base and
the controllable path is from collector to emitter. In MOS
technology, the control node is the gate and the controllable
path is the source/drain channel. The present invention is
concerned particularly but not exclusively with bipolar
technology. One of the transistors has a current setting
resistor connected in its controllable path and has its
control node connected to the control node of one transistor
and also into its own controllable path. When a current flows
through the current setting resistor, the same current is
caused to flow in the controllable path of the other
transistor and can be used to drive a suitable output
transistor to generate a source reference current related to
that current through the area ratio of the output transistor
and the current mirror transistors. Another pair of matched
current mirror transistors is connected in series with the
first pair between a supply voltage and ground and drives an
output transistor to generate a sink reference current. In
practical terms, the basic current mirror circuit has many
limitations. One of these is that its impedance is too low
for it to act as a perfect current source or sink when
connected to other circuitry. To increase the impedance, it
is common to include a pair of matched cascode transistors
connected respectively to each current mirror transistor for
each of source and sink current generating parts. Figure 1 illustrates a source/sink current generating circuit
of this type. The circuit comprises a first current mirror
circuit for generating a source current and a second current
mirror circuit for generating a sink current. The first
current mirror circuit comprises a first set of matched p-n-p
bipolar transistors Q1,Q2. These transistors have their
emitters connected to a supply voltage Vdd and their bases
connected to each other. In conventional current mirror
fashion, the base of the second transistor Q2 is connected to
its collector. A second set of similarly connected
transistors Q3,Q4 is connected in cascode to the first set. A
second current mirror circuit comprises a third set of
