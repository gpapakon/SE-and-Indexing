<ABSTRACT>
The inventon is relative to a combination comprising a triazole compound of 
formula I: 


wherein R is a straight-chain alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms which is 
non-substituted or substituted with 1 to 19 fluorine atoms, a branched alkyl group 

having 3 to 10 carbon atoms which is non-substituted or substituted with 1 to 19 
fluorine atoms, a cyclic alkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkyl group 

having 1 to 3 carbon atoms which is substituted with an alicyclic structure having 
3 to 7 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or an aralkyl group having 7 to 9 carbon 

atoms; X¹ is a halogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; X² is a 
hydrogen, a halogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; Y¹ is a 

hydrogen or a fluorine; and Y² is a hydrogen or a fluorine; and at least a coherbicide 
selected from phytohormone type of herbicides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to herbicidal compositions or 
combinations comprising triazole derivatives known per se and disclosed in EP-0 
282 303 and at least one co-herbicide. EP-0 282 303 discloses 1,5 - diphenyl - 1H - 1,2,4 - triazole - 
3 - carboxamide derivatives of formula I: 
wherein R is a straight-chain alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms which is 
non-substituted or substituted with 1 to 19 fluorine atoms, a branched alkyl group 
having 3 to 10 carbon atoms which is non-substituted or substituted with 1 to 19 
fluorine atoms, cyclic alkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkyl group 
having 1 to 3 carbon atoms which is substituted with an alicyclic structure having 
3 to 7 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or an aralkyl group having 7 to 9 carbon 
atoms; X¹ is a halogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; X² is a 
hydrogen, a halogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; Y¹ is a 
hydrogen or a fluorine and; Y² is a hydrogen or a fluorine. Said derivatives and 
compositions comprising them are said to show a high pre-emergent and post-emergent 
herbicidal activity but being practically harmless to rice, wheat and 
corn.  A drawback of said derivatives consists in that they may not be as 
effective on all weed species of a weed spectrum encountered in practice. More 
particularly, weeds like geranium, matricaria, brassica are not easily controlled 
by said derivatives, unless relatively high rates are used. Those high rates may 
then become detrimental to the crops like cereals including but not limited to rice, 
wheat and corn and, of course, reduce the commercial interest in said derivatives. It is known to solve the type of problems raised above by 
combinations of herbicides. Such combinations, however, have still to show the 
good properties of the main herbicides, here the triazole derivatives; there is low 
interest in antagonistic combinations. Moreover, the combinations should still 
show a similar selectivity as the main herbicide with respect to the crops. It is 
understandably difficult to determine the appropriate combinations in view of the 
myriade of herbicides available. EP-A-0 182 740 discloses herbicidal combinations of triazole 
derivatives of formula 
and a herbicidal urea, sulfonylurea or triazine derivative. Said combinations are 
said to show synergistic herbicidal efficacy against most of the monocotyledonous 
and dicotyledonous weeds in wheat crops. More recently, EP 0 427 695 has disclosed herbicidal compositions 
comprising isoproturon (a
