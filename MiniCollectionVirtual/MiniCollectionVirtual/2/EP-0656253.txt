<ABSTRACT>
Rigid composite panel comprising at least three layers, the first layer being an outer layer of gas- and vapour-permeable material, the second layer being a supporting layer of a thickness of more than 0.3 mm and the supporting layer having a multiplicity of clearances or holes, which affect at least 0.5% of the surface, and the third layer representing a gas- and vapour-permeable layer of a cellular material. Preferred are rigid composite panels in which the gas- and vapour-permeable layer of a cellular material forms the core and on both sides of the core there is applied a supporting layer and on the free side of the supporting layers there is an outer layer provided in each case. Rigid composite panels of this type can be used, for example, as panellings, walls, ceilings or floors in clean rooms.

Rigid composite panel containing at least three immediately successive layers
joined together by a bonded joint, the first layer being an outer layer, the second

layer being a supporting layer and the third layer being a gas-permeable and
vapour-permeable layer of a cellular material, characterised in that the outer layer

consists of gas-impermeable and vapour-impermeable material, that the supporting
layer has
 a thickness of at least 0.3 mm and comprises a plurality of recesses
covering more than 0.5 % of the surface, and that the gas-permeable and vapourpermeable

third layer consists of a moulded part of mutually bonded cellular
particles of expanded polystyrene, the cellular particles being joined together by a

cured adhesive.
Composite panel according to claim 1, characterised in that the recesses are
distributed regularly over the surface.
Composite panel according to claim 1, characterised in that the third layer is
provided with a fourth layer in the form of a supporting layer having a thickness of

at least 0.3 mm with a plurality of recesses covering more than 0.5 % of the surface
and the fourth layer is provided with a fifth layer in the form of an outer layer of

gas-impermeable and vapour-impermeable material.
Composite panel according to claim 1, characterised in that the gas-impermeable
and vapour-impermeable outer layers are compact plastic layers of plastics of the

series consisting of melamine resins, phenol-formaldehyde resins or polyvinyl
chloride or closed-cell foam layers of the series consisting of polyvinyl chloride

foams, polyurethane foams, polyolefin foams or polycarbonate foams.
Composite panel according to claim 1, characterised in that the composite panel
comprises five layers, the third layer forming a core of gas-permeable and vapour-permeable

cellular material and comprising a supporting layer of metal on either
side of the core, forming the second and a fourth layer, and an outer layer of a gas-impermeable 

and vapour-impermeable material being arranged on each of the
supporting layers, forming the first and a fifth layer.
Facade panels in building construction for external or internal purposes, cladding
panels for external claddings or for internal finishing, interior linings, partition

walls, movable partitions, floor panels, ceiling panels, display panels, billboards,
displays, poster panels and display surfaces with composite panels according to

claim 1.
Clean rooms with composite panels according to claim 1.
