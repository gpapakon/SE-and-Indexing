<ABSTRACT>
A plasma cleaning method for removing residues previously formed in a plasma treatment chamber by dry etching layers such as photoresist, barriers, etc., on a wafer. The method includes introducing a cleaning gas mixture of an oxidizing gas and a chlorine containing gas into the chamber followed by performing a plasma cleaning step. The plasma cleaning step is performed by activating the cleaning gas mixture and forming a plasma cleaning gas, contacting interior surfaces of the chamber with the plasma cleaning gas and removing residues on the interior surfaces. The cleaning gas mixture can also include a fluorine-based gas. For instance, the cleaning gas can include Cl2 and O2 and optionally CF4. An advantage of the cleaning method is that it is not necessary to open the plasma treatment chamber. Also, it is possible to completely remove all residues and prevent by-products formed during the cleaning step from remaining after the cleaning step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of cleaning
a vacuum treatment apparatus to remove previously
deposited aluminium-containing residues which have accumulated on interior
surfaces of the apparatus. For instance, the method
can be used to clean interior surfaces of a plasma
chamber wherein specimens such as silicon wafers having
one or more layers thereon are subjected to dry
etching. In particular, the invention relates to
plasma etching to remove aluminium-containing residues on electrodes,
interior walls, and other components located within a
plasma treatment chamber.It is conventional to dry etch a stack of
thin layers which can include a photoresist (for
patterning the underlying layers), an anti-reflective
coating (also known as an ARC layer, used for covering
the surface of the underlying layers), aluminum (or an
aluminum alloy), and a barrier material (such as metal,
metal compound or silicide). For instance, U.S. Patent
No. 4,986,877 discloses dry etching of aluminum with
Cl2, polysilicon with SF6, SiO2 and Si3N4 with a
fluorocarbon and photoresist with O2. U.S. Patent No.
5,022,958 discloses dry etching a dielectric with CHF3 +
Ar, removing polymer with pure oxygen and further
etching the dielectric with CHF3 + Ar + CF4. Such
etching, however, results in residues or deposits 
building up on surfaces inside the plasma treatment
chamber.When a film is dry etched in a chlorine-based
plasma (or a sequence of chlorine-based and fluorine-based
dry etches), residual reaction product
(henceforth referred to as "residues") adhere upon
surfaces in the plasma treatment chamber. These
residues contain metals (or silicates, depending on
which type of dry etch is used), chlorine, and organics
(or compounds of the aforementioned materials). The
surfaces that the residues adhere to include upper and
lower electrode surfaces, walls of the plasma treatment
chamber, clamping surfaces, and any other item with
which the plasma or its byproducts comes in contact. A
build-up of these residues deteriorates the etch
performance of the dry etch. As such, the presence of
such residues is undesirable.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 61-250185
discloses a method of removing deposits such as
SixCly on components of a plasma etching device. The
components include a high-frequency electrode and
interior surfaces of the plasma reaction chamber. Such
deposits are formed when aluminum on the wafer is dry
etched by a plasma formed from SiCl4. The deposits are
removed by contacting the interior surfaces of the
chamber
