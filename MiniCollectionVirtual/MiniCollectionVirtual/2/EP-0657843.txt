<ABSTRACT>
A computer interface system that is worn on the middle 
fingers of both hands of the computer operator for controlling 

cursor movement includes a left and right hand fixed inner ring 
(26), the inner ring (26) being of a dimension suitable to be 

worn on a portion of the middle fingers of the computer 
operator, and a left and right rotatable outer ring (28). The 

system includes sensing elements (38) disposed between each of 
the corresponding inner and outer rings (26,28) for producing 

horizontal movement signals in response to the rotation of the 
left outer ring (28) in relation to the left inner ring (26), 

and for producing vertical movement signals in response to the 
rotation of the right outer ring (28) in relation to the right 

inner ring (26). The system also includes a pressure sensitive 
element (46) disposed between corresponding inner and outer 

rings (26,28) that produces an entry signal in response to the 
application of pressure on the outer ring (28) toward the inner 

ring (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a graphic interface device
for computers, and more particularly to a graphic
interface device for computers that is worn on the
computer keyboard operator's fingers and emulates the
operation of a computer mouse.It is known in the field of computers to utilize
remote computer interface devices that are hand-operated
and physically separate from the keyboard. A well-known
computer interface device is commonly known as the
computer mouse, wherein the mouse is moved by hand over a
planar work surface to move a cursor on the computer
monitor. Many mouse-type devices have a small ball inside
the mouse, which protrudes slightly from the bottom
surface of the mouse. The ball rolls along the planar
work surface, requiring a certain amount of frictional
contact between the ball and the work surface. The mouse
also typically includes an electrical switch that can be
activated when the cursor is in a desired location in
order to cause an entry in the computer.A problem with the mouse-type devices is that the
mouse is used in connection with a keyboard for data
input. As a result, the user must repeatedly move his
hand between the keyboard and the computer mouse work
surface. The hand movement of the computer operator
consumes non-productive time during the movement of the
hand. The hand movement required for the operation of the
computer mouse is both inefficient and tiring to the user.
Therefore, a need exists for a mouse-type computer 
interface device that does not require the user to move
his hand from the keyboard to a remote location in order
to control the computer mouse and therefore expedites data
entry.Another problem with conventional mouse-type devices
is that the required movement of the user's hands from the
keys to the mouse interrupts the user's thought process.
Moreover, the user's brain is required to mentally adjust
from the vertical directional orientation of the keyboard
to the horizontal orientation on the mouse. Therefore, a
need exists for a computer mouse that does not require the
user's thought process to be interrupted when the user
activates the computer mouse.Computers are also being used for a wider spectrum of
applications. With increased computer applications, an
increased need for a variety of computer mouse devices has
evolved. For example, increased use of computer mice,
together with more compact computers, has created a need
for a compact computer mouse-type device that is within
easy access of the computer operator when the operator's
hands are
