<ABSTRACT>
Process and machine for exterior packaging of loads arranged in a palletized or non-palletized package, (F), using a stretch film positioned about said package and, if necessary, about a pallet after being pre-stretched and unwound from a spool or similar (14) on which it is stored in its pre-stretched state with an extension value in the region of 150 to 500 % and a tension, after relaxation, of between 2 and 7, preferably from 2 to 3, DAN/mm2 film section per turn.

Process for over-wrapping loads unitized in a 
bundle, whether palletized or not, by means of a 

stretchable film applied around the said bundle and, 
where relevant, a pallet after it has been pre-stretched 

and unwound from a roll or the like (14) on which it is 
stored in the pre-stretched state, characterised by the 

fact that the film (11) is pre-stretched to an elongation 
value of the order of 150 to 500% and so that it has, 

after relaxation, a tension in the roll of between 2 and 
7, and preferably between 2 and 3 daN/mm
2
 of film section 
per turn. 
Machine for over-wrapping loads unitized in a 
bundle, whether palletized or not, by means of a 

stretchable film applied around the said bundle having 

reception means for a roll or the like (4) on which the 
over-wrapping film (11) is stored in the pre-stretched 

state, characterised by the fact that the reception means 
are means for the reception of a roll or the like (14), 

means for the reception of a roll or the like (14) with a 
substantially cylindrical skirt (20) and bevelled ends 

(21, 22) on which the over-wrapping film (11) is stored 
in the pre-stretched state at an elongation value of the 

order of 150 to 500% and means for braking the roll or 
the like (14) which are adjustable to a tension in the 

film between 2 and 7 daN/mm
2
, and preferably between 2 and 
3 daN/mm
2
 of section of film per turn, with the exclusion 
of complementary means for stretching the said film. 
Machine as described in claim 2, characterised by 
the fact that it also includes means for support or 

reserve rolls (14) of pre-stretched film and means for  
 

transfer of the said rolls to reception means from which 
the film stored in the pre-stretched state is unwound. 
Machine as described in either of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised by the fact that it is of the rotating ring 

type (31), i.e. with a fixed bundle (F) and means for 
support of a roll of film in the pre-stretched state 

provided on the said rotating ring. 
Machine as described in either of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised by the fact that it is of the "rotating arm 

(B)" type. 
Machine as described in either of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised by the fact that it is of the "rotating 

load" type. 
Machine as described in claim 2, characterised by 
the fact that it is of the "full-web" type. 
Roll or the like for carrying out the process as 
described in claim 1 and/or suitable for use on a machine 

as described in any one of claims 2 to 7, characterised 
by the fact that it comprises a film (11) for 

over-wrapping loads unitized in a bundle, whether 
palletized or not, stored in the pre-stretched state with 

an elongation of 150 to 500% and to have, after 
relaxation, a tension of between 2 and 7, and preferably 

2 to 3, DAN/mm
2
 of section per turn. 
Roll as described in claim 8, characterised by the 
fact that it has a substantially cylindrical skirt (20) 

and bevelled ends (21, 22).
