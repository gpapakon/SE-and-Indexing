<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric heating fan or the like which comprises a casing, which is fitted on a base part so as to be pivotable in an oscillating manner and is designed to accommodate a blower and an electric heating device, and control units for the latter. To achieve a reliable and simple joint between fan casing and base part, and to achieve a simple design of the base part, the invention calls for the arrangement of a one-piece base part (2), formed by a single injection-moulded part, with a crank mechanism (10, 12, 14) which can be driven by an electric motor (8), and switching and connection elements, and a heating fan (1) which is held so as to be freely pivotable directly on the base part (2) and is coupled to the crank mechanism (10, 12, 14) so as to swivel in an oscillating manner.
