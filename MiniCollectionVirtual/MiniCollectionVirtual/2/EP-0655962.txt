<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (50) for and method of installing angle plates (22) at the corners of ducts (20) which has channel shaped flanges (24) into which is installed an angle plate (22) with the angle plates (22) securing adjacent ducts (20). The angle plates (22) are fed by a hopper (58) and associated machinery (50) is constructed whereby a lowermost angle plate (22) in a stack is fed into position overlying duct channel flanges (24) after the duct (20) has been clamped in place followed by the forcing of the angle plate (22) into the duct channel flanges (24) and the securement of the angle plate (22) in place. The machine (51) may place two angle plates (22) into two corners of one end of the duct (20) and, further, there may be two sets of machinery (50) so as to simultaneously place angle plates (22) into the channel flanges (24) at both the bottom and top of a duct (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the placement of angle plates into
the corner defined by channel flanges at the ends of panels
of a duct of a conventional type. More specifically, the
invention relates to an angle plate for joining together channel
shaped flanges at an end of a duct. Such angle plates are known from,
for instance, US-A-4 466 641.It is well known to connect the ends of sheet metal ducts by
providing the ducts at opposite ends of the panels of the
ducts which open towards one another and wherein there is
disposed at the corners of the ducts angle plates which have
opposite ends thereof seated in and connect together adjacent
angle flanges. The ducts are then secured together by way of
fasteners which connect together the angle plates.Attention is here directed to the patents to Heilman et al,
US Patent No 4,466,641 and La Crosse et al, US Patent No
4,542,923, which clearly disclose ducts formed with the
channel flanges into which there are forced angle plates by
way of which the ducts are connected together by bolts
passing through the angle plates.To date, the angle plates are manually secured to the ducts
by manually forcing the angle plates into the duct channel
flanges. This is time consuming and thus costly. Further,
each angle plate must be positioned individually. In accordance with this invention, there is provided an
angle plate for joining together channel shaped flanges at
an end of a duct, said angle plate including two legs
joined together in angular relation by an integral corner
and configured to permit stacking of a plurality of plates
in order that said legs of adjacent plates are in line and
facing in the same direction, said angle plate being
characterised by each of said legs and said corner having
projections projecting therefrom in a common direction and
being of a height to hold adjacent plates parallel and
spaced, thereby preventing nesting and permitting sliding
single plates off the bottom of a stack of plates.Next, in order that angle plates may be automatically
positioned within duct channel flanges, there is provided
machinery which will automatically secure a duct for the
reception of one or more angle plates. When the duct
securing operation is completed, an angle plate will be
moved from the bottom of a stack of angle plates against a
corner of the duct and above the adjacent channel flanges.Inasmuch as there is a notch defined by adjacent ends of
adjacent channel flanges, it has been found that an angle
plate may be best positioned for pressing into the channel

An angle plate (22) for joining together channel shaped
flanges at an end of a duct, said angle plate including two

legs (38) joined together in angular relation by an integral

corner and configured to permit stacking of a plurality of
plates in order that said legs (38) of adjacent plates are in

line and facing in the same direction, said angle plate
being characterised by each of said legs and said corner having

projections (40,46,188) projecting therefrom in a common direction and
being of a height to hold adjacent plates parallel and

spaced, thereby preventing nesting and permitting sliding
single plates off the bottom of a stack of plates.
An angle plate according to Claim 1 wherein said
projections are in the form of tabs adjacent free ends of

said legs, and tabs at said corner struck from said corner.
An angle plate according to Claim 2 wherein said tabs
adjacent ends of said legs are formed from extensions of

said legs reversely folded in overlying relation to said
legs.
An angle plate according to Claim 3 wherein said tabs
adjacent ends of said legs are formed from extensions of

said legs reversely folded in overlying relation to said
legs and in an upwardly and longitudinal curving relation.
An angle plate according to Claim 2 wherein said tabs
adjacent ends of said legs are struck from said legs.
An angle plate according to Claim 5 wherein said tabs
adjacent ends of said legs are struck from said legs and

are T-shaped. 
An angle plate according to Claim 2 wherein said tabs
at said corner are formed from material struck from said

corner in the formation of a bolt hole in said corner.
