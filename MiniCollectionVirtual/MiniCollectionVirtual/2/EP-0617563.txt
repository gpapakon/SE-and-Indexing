<ABSTRACT>
A data processing system is disclosed for providing digital 
video information on subscriber demand, for very large 

video data files. The system enables rapid response to the 
requests by network subscribers, independent of the number 

of video files offered for selection. The data processing 
system is coupled through a data switch to a subscriber 

communications network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing
systems and methods and more particularly relates to broadcasting
large digital files to subscribers on demand in a
subscriber network.There has been a strong trend in recent years toward the
conversion of still pictures and full motion video into
digital form. This trend has been driven to some extent by
the need to provide images and full motion video on compact
disk read only memory units to support the entertainment
and home computer market. The increasing use of digitized
video has been accompanied by the interest of various
industry groups such as the Motion Picture Experts Group
(MPEG), to develop standards for digital video compression,
making it practical to handle full motion video over narrow
band channels. The MPEG video compression/decompression
algorithms provide a suitable compression for the information
in digital video recordings, enabling their storage in
compact form on digital storage media.As digital video becomes more available, new methods of
handling movies and their distribution must be implemented
to adequately compete with existing distribution channels.
Video storage has traditionally been provided in analog or
digital form by video tape. This has led to an industry
built around that technology, network television, cable TV,
video rental stores and the like. Network TV and cable TV 
have used "a broadcast" medium where the consumer is locked
into time schedules which are predetermined by the service
packager. Video rental stores have provided additional
convenience to the consumer by providing movies that the
consumer wishes to see at the time the consumer wishes to see
them, or video on demand. What is needed is a broadcast
medium where the consumer is not locked into a time schedule
which is predetermined by the service packager.WO-A-91 03112 describes a video-on-demand system, which seeks
to optimize the transmission to multiple users over a
transmission system. A scheduling algoritm is disclosed which
ensures that after a request the user need not wait longer
than a predetermined maximum response time until playback of
the video file starts, which is then played continuously on
the user's receiver. For that purpose the video file is
divided into a plurality of segments of a size, which can be
transmitted within the maximum response time. These segments
are then scheduled for transmission and stored in a buffer
memory of the receiver such that continuous playback is
ensured.GB-A-2 207 838 discloses a digital

A data processing system coupled to a subscriber
communications network through a data switch for

providing digital video data on subscriber demand,
comprising:


a gateway coupled to the network, for receiving a
request from a subscriber, for said digital video;
a control server coupled to said gateway, for receiving
a subscriber ID and video ID from said gateway and

determining if a subscriber queue exists in said control
server corresponding to said video ID and is accepting

new subscribers;
said control server determining if a port is available
if no subscriber queue exists for said video ID and

creating a new subscriber queue in said control server
if a new port having a new port ID is available,
starting a new queue timer for adding subscribers to
said new subscriber queue and scheduling said video ID

for said new port ID at a new start time;
said control server assigning said subscriber ID to said
new subscriber queue;
said control server sending said new port ID and
subscriber ID to the data switch to connect said new

port to the subscriber.
The system of claim 1, wherein the control server
determines if an existing subscriber queue has been

previously assigned to a port having a port ID and
assigns said subscriber ID to the existing subscriber

queue.
The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the control server
sends video information to the port ID and the new start

time to the gateway.
The system of one the claims 1-3, which further
comprises: a data server coupled to said control server 

and to the data switch, for receiving said video ID and
new port ID after said new queue timer times out;


said data server accessing a video storage in said data
server with said video ID and loading a first page of

video data into an A-buffer and second page of video
data into a B-buffer;
said data server connecting said A-B buffers to said new
port using said new port ID;
said data server outputting A-buffer and B-buffer pages
of serialized video data to said data switch;
said data server sending a termination message to said
data switch to release connections between said new port

and subscribers in said network.
The system of claim 4, wherein said data server
selectively couples said A-B buffers to said new port

using said new port ID and outputting said A-buffer to
said new port to send said video data as a data stream

to said data switch;

said data server outputting said B-buffer to said new
port when said A-buffer is empty and reloading said A-buffer

by accessing a next page of video data from said
video storage using said next video storage accessing

address;

B-buffer pages of video data as a data stream to said

data switch until an end of said video data is detected.
The system of one of the claims 1-5, wherein said
gateway further comprises:


a voice response unit for responding a first response to
the subscriber;
said gateway receiving said subscriber ID and video ID
from the subscriber and validating said subscriber ID;
said gateway accessing a gateway video catalog using
said video ID, to obtain voice response data describing

said digital video data and responding a second response
to the subscriber with said voice response data.
The system of one of the claims 1-6, wherein said data
server further comprises: a video data selector coupled

to a plurality of video data files in said video storage
unit, for receiving said video ID and in response

thereto, selecting one of said plurality of video data
files for coupling to said A-B buffers;


a multiplexer coupled to a plurality of said ports, for
receiving said port ID and in response thereto,
selecting one of said plurality of ports for coupling to
said A-B buffers; whereby a selected one of said

plurality of video data files can be output to a
selected one of said plurality of ports.
Method for providing digital video data on subscriber
demand in a data processing system coupled to a

subscriber communications network through a data switch,
