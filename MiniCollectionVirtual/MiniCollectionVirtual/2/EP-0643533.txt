<ABSTRACT>
A motion detecting circuit and a noise reducing circuit of high 
reliability and independent of the magnitude of motion, presence/absence of 

noise, and magnitude of the noise. The motion detecting circuit includes a 
subtractor 14 which receives as inputs, an input video signal VS
i
 from an 
input terminal 10 and a delayed video signal VS
d
 delayed by one picture unit 
(one frame in the case of the NTSC format) from a frame memory 12. The 

difference between the two signals VS
i
 and VS
d
 is taken and a difference 
signal e is output for each pixel of a video display. A motion determination 

circuit 16 is provided, having: a difference polarity determination unit which 
determines the polarity of difference e as input from a difference generating 

unit 15 for each pixel and its adjacent pixels; a difference value 
determination unit which determines the magnitude of difference e as input 

from difference generating unit 15 for each pixel and its adjacent pixels; and 
a motion determination unit which determines whether the pixel is contained 

in the motion picture region based on the results of the determination of the 
difference polarity determination unit and the difference value determination 

unit; and a 1-bit motion determination signal MC representing the results of 
the determination of the motion determination unit is output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a motion detecting circuit for detecting a
motion picture or a motion picture region, particularly in a video display, and
a noise reducing circuit which can reduce the noise level contained in a video
signal.Figure 16 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of a conventional
motion detecting circuit used in a digital TV receiver, etc.
A conventional circuit is known from US-A-4 661 853.
Input to input
terminal 100 is video signal VSi, which is an 8-bit TV signal prepared by A/D
conversion after demodulation. This input video signal VSi is sent both to
one input terminal of subtractor 102 and frame memory 104 and edge
detecting circuit 106. Frame memory 104 sends the video signal of the
previous picture, that is, the video signal of one previous frame in the NTSC
format, as delayed video signal VSd to the other input terminal of subtractor
102.Subtractor 102 subtracts delayed video signal VSd from input video
signal VSi to derive the difference in units of pixels. Difference signal e
output from subtractor 102 is converted to absolute value |e| by absolute
value circuit 108, and the absolute value is then sent to nonlinear processing
circuit 110. Nonlinear processing circuit 110 has the nonlinear input/output
characteristics shown in Figure 17. It outputs output signal f as, for
example, 6-bit signal, corresponding to input difference absolute value |e| to
one input terminal of divider 112.Edge detecting circuit 106 passes input image signal VSi to two-dimensional
high pass filter and outputs in, for example, a 4-bit signal form,
edge detection signal eg which is expressed with even a fineness of edge
corresponding to determination on whether each pixel is within the edge
portion (profile) portion. The signal eg is sent to the other input terminal of 
divider 112. At divider 102, one input signal f is divided by the other input
signal eg, and the quotient h (f/eg) is output in, for example, 4-bit signal
form. Output signal h of divider 112 is quantized to the desired bit number
by quantization circuit 114, and the signal is output from output terminal
116 as a multivalue (for example, 2-bit) or binary (1-bit) motion signal ms.In the static picture region, as the difference e between input video
signal VSi and delayed video signal VSd of the previous picture, and its
absolute value |e| is null or near null, that is, the value is smaller than
threshold TH of nonlinear processing circuit 110, no significant output signal
f is generated by nonlinear processing circuit 110, and
