<ABSTRACT>
An endotracheal tube introducer (100) comprising a proximal end (12) and a distal end (14), the proximal end (12) comprising a mouth (30) of greater diameter than an endotracheal tube being inserted into it and an elongated portion connected to, and extending longitudinally away from, the mouth for insertion thereof past the epiglottis, between the vocal cords, into the trachea, the elongated portion comprising at least one guide (16) and reinforcing portion extending longitudinally along the length of the elongated portion away from the proximal end (12) and mouth (30), and relatively thin pliable side portions or wings (18A, 18B) extending laterally from the sides of the guide portion (16), one from each side and overlap one another at least proximate the distal end (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an Endotracheal Tube
Introducer.Devices have been provided in the past for
assisting to introduce the endotracheal tube past the
vocal cords into the trachea. One such device was a
"stylette type" introducer. The stylette introducer was
of small diameter such as a wire positioned to extend
between the vocal cords into the trachea. The
endotracheal tube was then placed on the guide wire and
advanced over the stylette past the vocal cords. In use,
however, it was not always possible to pass the
endotracheal tube over the stylette as the endotracheal
tube introducer would from time to time get caught on
various structures in the pharynx including the opening of
the larynx causing trauma to these structures.
Additionally, the use of the stylette required the use of
two hands to manipulate the endotracheal tube over the
stylette when often only one hand was available as the
other hand was holding the laryngoscope.Another proposal provided for a pharyngeal
introducer which did not pass between the vocal cords, but
sat in the upper pharynx and generally directing the
endotracheal tube "towards" the vocal cords and larynx
blindly. In use the endotracheal tube was inserted into
the pharyngeal introducer and passed inside the introducer
whose curvature was designed to guide the endotracheal
tube towards the larynx. In use, however, this type of
device had a fairly low success rate even in the hands of
the most skilled and did not prevent any trauma of the
advancing endotracheal tube to the tissue along its way.
Furthermore, it cannot be removed when used and thus, the
patients mouth continued to be propped open in an
exaggerated manner dictated by the diameter of such 
introducers generally of large diameter.The endotracheal tube introducer in U.S. Patent
4,211,234 constituted an improvement to the previous
devices and referred to a number of devices the
particulars of which are incorporated herein by reference.
The device in U.S. Patent 4,211,234 while an advance over
the prior art, because of its construction still
necessitated the use of substantial material at the distal
end of the device to surround the endotracheal tube when
advancing along the interior of the endotracheal tube
introducer. Thus, even if the amount of material at the
distal end is wrapped tightly, a substantial amount of
material still exists which must be passed between the
vocal cords and into the larynx. If such volume of
material is packed very tightly, spreading or unwrapping
of the material may be difficult as

<CLAIMS>
An endotracheal tube introducer comprising a proximal end (12) and a distal end (14),
the proximal end comprising a mouth (30) into which an endotracheal tube is insertable and

an elongated portion connected to, and extending longitudinally away from, the mouth (30)
for insertion thereof past the epiglottis, between the vocal cords, into the trachea, the

elongated portion comprising at least one guide (16) and reinforcing (22)

portion extending longitudinally along the length of the elongated portion away from the
proximal end (12) and mouth and characterised by further comprising relatively thin pliable

side portions or wings (18A, 18B) connected to the portion guide (16) and extending laterally
from the sides of the guide portion (16), one from each side, and being unconnected to each

other or any other structure and presenting free edges unconnected to any other portion of
the endotracheal tube introducer except the guide (16) and reinforcing (22) portion and which

side portions or wings overlap one another at least proximate the distal end.
The introducer of Claim 1 wherein the endotracheal tube introducer is curved along
its length.
The introducer of Claim 1 wherein the side portions or wings (18A, 18B) taper
towards the distal end (14).
The introducer of Claim 3 wherein the side portions or wings overlap and taper
presenting an interior volume surrounding the longitudinal axis of diminishing diameter

towards the distal end (14).
The introducer of Claim 1 wherein the thin pliable side portions or wings (18A, 18B)
each taper towards its free edge.
The introducer of any of Claims 2 to 5, wherein the mouth of the introducer is
surrounded by an interrupted annular wall (20) carrying a radially extending handle (20')

extending circumferentially for at least a substantial portion of the circumference of the
mouth (30), around the mouth. 
The introducer of Claim 6 wherein the annular wall and handle are continuous for
substantially 350Â° around the mouth terminating at an end (32, 34).
The introducer of Claim 7 wherein the handle (20') is of such thickness so that when
the edge portions (32, 34) of each circumferential end of the handle engage, the engagement

of the ends prevents the overlap of the spaced apposing edges of the annular wall when they
are squeezed together during intubation.
The introducer of Claim 5 wherein the side portions or wings (18A, 18B) of the guide
portion (16) taper towards the distal end (14) so that proximate the distal end the side

portions or wings have disappeared.
The introducer of any preceding claim wherein the introducer comprises a
thermoplastic material.
