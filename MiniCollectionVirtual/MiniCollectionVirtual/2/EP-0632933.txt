<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a miniaturized staggered 
high- density coaxial interconnect system for use in the 
termination of coaxial signal cables to electrical signal 
transmission systems, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs). The 
system is easy to assemble and provides easy attachment to and 
detachment from the transmission system. This invention also 
provides for an increased density of signal cables with improved 
spacing due to the unique design of component parts and their 
arrangement within the system. High speed computers and large scale integrated circuits and 
processes require the design of connectors with increased density, 
precision quality, and improved electrical performance. In addition to the increased density of electrical leads, 
design parameters have imposed severe space limitations over the 
connector area to accommodate the ever increasing number of 
signals. These restraints lead to additional needs for matching or 
improving impedance control and attenuation and for minimizing 
noise and cross-talk in the region of the interconnection and 
transmission system (PCB). Quality of signal and minimal 
propagation delay must also be maintained. There is a need for an improved arrangement of coaxial 
assemblies that minimizes spacing between electrical leads, 
provides for increased density and yet maintains the desired 
electrical characteristics and quality of transmission.  
 U.S. Patent No. 3,219,963 to O'Keefe relates to a 
conventional low density adaptor having a Y-type construction with 
apertures in blocks so as to align coaxial cable contacts. There 
are no staggered arrays nor a plurality of modules having staggered 
receptacle grooves to receive the ground contacts and signal pins. 
Moreover, the O'Keefe adaptor is designed to connect to another 
cable and not to a signal transmission system such as a printed 
circuit board as required by the claimed invention. U.S. Patent No. 3,128,138 to Noschese relates to a front 
release coaxial connector. It describes a 
cable to cable connector having an internal bead and an 
interlocking spring. Such a construction employs a substantial 
amount of space thus causing the connector to be quite bulky. To 
the contrary, the present claimed invention eliminates the need for 
a bead and spring thus providing for a substantially higher density 
connector while still allowing relative ease in assembly of the 
individual connectors. U.S. Patent No. 4,705,336 to Bonhomme provides a female-female 
adaptor which allows for the
