<ABSTRACT>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a vehicle wheel. A disc-shaped carrier (6) (wheel disc) to which the wheel rim (7) is screwed presents a tubular portion (28) which is affixed to a hub portion (3) by means of a screw connection (30). A neck portion (20) integral with the carrier radially externally of the screw connection presents an external shaping (21, 22) which meshes with an internal shaping (23, 24) on the brake disc (8). This arrangement eliminates the need for the screw connection to act as a braking moment transmitting element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel hub and brake disc 
arrangement for heavy vehicles. Disc brakes, which until now have almost without exception only 
been used on cars and lighter commercial vehicles, have 
recently been further developed for use in the heaviest 
category of trucks in which the braking moment can reach 2000 
kpm. In the known disc brake type for this class of vehicle the 
brake disc and the "wheel disc", i.e. the disc-shaped carrier 
to which the wheel rim is intended to be bolted, is affixed to 
the wheel hub via a common screw connection. In such a 
construction, the entire braking moment acts through the screw 
connection. This implies that the connection must be 
dimensioned so as to accommodate very large forces. High 
demands are thus placed on the assembly work during, for 
example, replacement of brake discs, for example that the 
correct tightening torque is applied to the common screw 
connection, in order to eliminate the risk of failure 
attributable to too great stresses in the connection. US-A-3 941 221 discloses a wheel hub and brake disc arrangement 
which differs from the prior art arrangement described above 
basically in that the disc-shaped carrier is welded to the hub. 
The entire braking moment acts in this case through the weld. 
High demands are thus placed on the welding process. It is an object in the present invention to provide a wheel hub 
and brake disc arrangement of the above mentioned type in which 
the disadvantages of a common screw or weld connection for the 
brake disc and the disc-shaped carrier can be eliminated.  
 This is achieved in accordance with the invention by means of a 
wheel hub and brake disc arrangement having the features of 
claim 1. By forming an externally shaped disc carrying region integrally 
with the "wheel disc", an interlocking connection with the 
brake disc is created in the direction of rotation. The braking 
moment is thus transmitted through the interlocking connection 
without having to pass through a screw or weld connection. This 
implies that the connection does not need to be dimensioned to 
accommodate the very high braking moments which arise during 
heavy braking of commercial vehicles of the heaviest category. The invention will be described in greater detail in the 
following with reference to the embodiments shown in the 
attached drawings in which fig. 1 shows a longitudinal 
sectional view through a portion of a previously known wheel 
hub and brake disc arrangement and fig. 2 shows a corresponding

<CLAIMS>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a 
vehicle wheel, comprising a hub portion (3) rotatably 

carried by bearing means (2) on a stub axle, a brake disc 
carrier (20) connected to the hub portion, a brake disc 

(8) non-rotatably affixed to the brake disc carrier and a 
disc-shaped carrier (6) which is affixed to the hub 

portion via a screw connection (30) and to which carrier 
a wheel rim is intended to be bolted, wherein the brake 

disc carrier (20) is integrally formed with the disc-shaped 
carrier (6) radially externally of said screw 

connection (30), said brake disc carrier having a non-circular 
external shaping onto which a brake disc (8) 

having an opening which presents a corresponding internal 

shaping is non-rotatably fixed. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that the brake disc supporting region forms a neck 
portion (20) separated from the hub portion (31) with the 

screw connection (30) by a ring-shaped channel (33). 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that the outer race (31) of a unit 
bearing forms said hub portion and presents a ring-shaped 

radial flange (4) to which a tubular portion (28) of the 
carrier (6) is affixed via said screw connection (30). 
Arrangement according to claim 3, 

characterized in
 that the tubular portion (28) is adapted 
to be a press fit on a cylindrical surface (32) of the 

hub portion (3). 
Arrangement according to anyone of claims 1-4, 

characterized in
 that the screws (30) in the screw 
connection are screwed into the carrier (6) from the side 

of the hub portion (3) facing the wheel spindle.
