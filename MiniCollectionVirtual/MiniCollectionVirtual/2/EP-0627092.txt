<ABSTRACT>
In an optical fibre for transmitting high-powered laser light, a thin metal layer (10) is provided on a glass fibre (2, 4) coated with an intermediate polymer layer (6, 8). This facilitates the detection of a break in the fibre by simple electrical resistance measurement.

Device for transmitting high-power laser 
radiation, having an optical fibre, which comprises a 

glass fibre having a fibre core (2) and a fibre 
cladding (4), which optical fibre is provided with at 

least one intermediate layer (6, 8), which consists of 
a polymer an
d envelops the fibre cladding (4), with 
there being arranged on the outer surface of the 

intermediate layer (6, 8) a metallic layer (10), which 
optical fibre is provided with means (12, 14) for 

protecting this metallic layer (10) from mechanical 
destruction by abrasion, and with means for detecting 

the electrical resistance of the metallic layer (10) 
being provided in order to monitor the state of the 

optical fibre. 
Device according to claim 1, with the 
intermediate layer (6, 8) comprising an auxiliary layer 

(6), which consists of a soft polymer and is arranged 
on the fibre cladding (4) and on which is arranged a 

protective layer (8), which likewise consists of a 
polymer and the modulus of elasticity of which is 

greater than the modulus of elasticity of the auxiliary 
layer (6). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, with the 
means (12, 14) for protecting the metallic layer (10) 

comprising an additional protective layer (12), which 
is deposited onto the metallic layer (10). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
with the layer thickness of the metallic layer (10) 

amounting to between 0.1 µm and 5 µm. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
with there being provided a protective device, which is 

activated if the electrical resistance exceeds a 
predetermined limiting value. 
Device according to claim 5, with the 
protective device comprising a diaphragm which can be  

 
brought into the beam path of the laser radiation. 
Use of an optical fibre for transmitting high-power 
laser radiation, which optical fibre comprises a
