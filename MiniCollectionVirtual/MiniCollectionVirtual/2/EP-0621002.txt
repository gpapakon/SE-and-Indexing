Shower screen, having two constructional units (11), each
composed of two first and second solid segments (12, 13)

connected to one another in an articulated manner by way of
vertical axes, of which the first segments (12) can be fastened

to the wall each by means of a pivotable wall hanging fixture,
while the second segments (13), in the closed state of the shower

screen (4), butt against one another and thus form a closed
shower cubicle above a bath tub (1),

characterized in that the first segments (12) of the

constructional units (11), which are of straight design, can be
fastened by their wall hanging fixtures at a distance from one

another to one and the same wall (2) adjacent to the bath tub
(1), and in the closed state of the shower screen form an angle

of approximately 90° with respect to the wall (2) and run
approximately parallel to one another,


in that the second segments (13), which butt against one another
with their lateral edges (14), are curved and, in the closed

state of the shower screen, together with the wall (2) and the
two first segments (12) form the closed shower cubicle (4), and
in that, in the open state of the shower screen, the first and
second segments (12, 13) can be swung in front of the wall (2),

folded up [lacuna] the vertical axes.
Shower screen according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the position of the first, inner segments
(12), in the showering position, is defined by a stop or the

like, that is to say the two first segments (12) can be swung
from the showering position only in the direction of the rest

position, but not in the opposite direction.
Shower screen according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the two first segments (12) swing outwards
from the showering position into the rest position and the two 

second, outer segments (13) swing inwards from the showering
position into the rest position and in that, preferably, the

second segments (13), in the showering position, are blocked from
a further outward swinging movement.
Shower screen according to one of Claims 1-3,

characterized in that the segments (7, 12, 13) are provided, at
the points of connection to the wall (2) and to one another

respectively, with fixing elements for fixing in certain, preset
relative positions with respect to one another.
Shower screen according to one of Claims 1-4,

characterized by locking elements in the wall hanging fixtures,
which lock the first segments (12) at an angle of approximately

90° to the wall (2), while the joints to the second segments (13)
remain freely movable.
Shower screen according to one of Claims 1-5,

characterized in that each of the second segments (13) forms
approximately a quarter circle.
Shower screen according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that the free lateral edges (14) of the second
segments (13) are each fitted with a magnetic strip for closure

and sealing.
