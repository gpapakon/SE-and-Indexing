<ABSTRACT>
A doped region (2a) is made in a substrate (10) such that it is bounded by insulation regions (12, 13) at least at the surface of the substrate (10). An undoped silicon layer (4) is deposited over the entire surface. A doped zone (4c) which reliably overlaps the region for the contact hole is selectively produced in the silicon layer (4). Undoped parts of the silicon layer (4) are removed selectively with respect to the doped zones (4c). An insulation layer (6) is produced over the entire surface, in which insulation layer a contact hole (7a) is opened by anisotropic etching of the silicon layer (4) selectively with respect to the doped zone (4c). The method is suitable for making compact bit line contacts in DRAMs with p-channel MOSFETs in the cell field and can particularly advantageously be combined with the so-called BOSS process (boron outdiffused silicon strap).

Method for the fabrication of a contact hole to
a first doped region of a first conductivity type in a

semiconductor wafer having doped regions of the first
and of a second conductivity type,


in which first of all the first doped region
(2a) is fabricated in the substrate (10) in such a way

that it is bounded by insulation regions (12, 13) at
least on the surface of the substrate (1),
in which a barrier layer (3) is then
produced, which is provided as a diffusion and/or

etching barrier, leaves at least the first doped region
(2a) uncovered and covers a second doped region (2b) of

a second conductivity type,
in which an undoped silicon layer (4) is
deposited over the whole area,
in which a doped zone, which overlaps the
region for the subsequent contact hole, is selectively

produced in the silicon layer (4) by implantation or
additionally by outdiffusion from the first doped

region (2a),
in which a heat treatment is performed in
order to distribute and activate the dopant in the

doped zone of the silicon layer (4), outdiffusion from
the second doped region into the undoped silicon layer

(4) being prevented at the locations at which the
barrier layer (3) covers the second doped region (2b), 
in which undoped parts of the silicon layer
(4) are removed selectively with respect to the doped

zone,
in which an insulation layer (6) is produced
over the whole area,
in which the contact hole (7a) is opened in
the insulation layer (6) by means of anisotropic

etching selectively with respect to the doped zone (4c)
of the silicon layer.
Method according to Claim 1, in which the
substrate (10) is composed of monocrystalline silicon.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
silicon layer (4) is fabricated from polysilicon.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the undoped parts of the silicon layer (4) are

removed by wet-chemical etching.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which the barrier layer (3) is fabricated from silicon

nitride.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in
which the uncovered parts of the barrier layer (3) are

removed prior to the application of the insulation
layer (6).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in
which the doped zone (4c) of the silicon layer (4) is

p-doped, and in which the undoped parts of the silicon
layer (4) are removed by wet-chemical etching using

potassium hydroxide solution.
Method according to Claim 7, in which a boron
concentration of between 10

in the doped zone (4c) of the silicon layer (4).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

in which the doped region (2a) in the
substrate (10) is a source-drain zone of a MOS

transistor,
in which the insulation regions comprise
insulating sidewall coverings (13) and insulating 

covering layers (12) of the gate electrode (1) of the

MOS transistor.
Method according to Claim 9,

in which a further contact hole (7b) to the
gate electrode (10) is opened at the same time that the

contact hole (7a, 7c) to the doped region (2a) is
opened.
Method according to one of Claims 9 to 10, in
which the MOS transistor (1, 2) is a selection

transistor of a memory cell comprising a storage
capacitor, one electrode of the storage capacitor being

connected to a further doped zone of the MOS transistor
via a doped polysilicon structure.
