<ABSTRACT>
The key proposed is particularly suitable for low-profile keyboard equipment since the movement produced by the key on a push rod (30) is converted by cams (40) into a motion at right angles to the movement of the key. For contacting puposes, a contactor (46) is moved relative to a fixed contact piece. The contactor is designed as an elongated sheet-metal ring (50) capable, owing to its length, of bearing large forces while suffering to a lesser extent from metal fatigue.
