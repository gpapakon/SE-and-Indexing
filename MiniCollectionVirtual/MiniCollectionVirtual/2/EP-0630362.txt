<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for purifying a hexafluoroethane product containing CC1F3 and/or CHF3 impurities which comprises the step of contacting the product with a sorbent for said impurities selected from activated carbons and inorganic (e.g., zeolite) molecular sieves at a temperature and a pressure suitable for sorption for a period of time sufficient to remove a substantial amount of said impurities. Also disclosed is an improvement to a process for producing CF3CF3 by fluorination of C2Cl3CF3, C2Cl2F4 and/or C2ClF5 to produce a hexafluoroethane product containing CClF3 and/or CHF3 impurities, wherein the improvement comprises said sorbent contact step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purification of 
fluorocarbon products, and more particularly to the 
purification of hexafluoroethane (i.e., FC-116 or 
CF3CF3) products. Products containing hexafluoroethane (i.e., 
hexafluoroethane products) are produced in various 
degrees of purity. One type of hexafluoroethane 
product, resulting for example from the fluorination of 
a trichlorotrifluoroethane, a dichlorotetrafluoroethane 
and/or chloropentafluoroethane, often contains 
significant amounts of chlorotrifluoromethane and/or 
fluoroform. Various gaseous fluorine-containing compounds are 
utilized to etch silica type materials for use in 
integrated circuits, see e.g., A. J. Woytek, J. Fluor. 
Chem. 33, 331-334 (1986). A major use of 
hexafluoroethane is as a plasma etchant in semiconductor 
device fabrication. It interacts with the surface of 
the integrated circuit wafer, modifying it so as to lay 
down the electrical pathways and providing for the 
surface functionalities that define the integrated 
circuit. As manufacturers are continually trying to 
increase the number of functionalities packed per unit 
surface area, the increasing fineness of surface detail 
in turn requires greater precision and consistency of 
the effect the etchant has on the wafer substrate. 
Products of high purity are critical for this 
application. It has been found that even very small 
amounts of impurities can result in wide line width and 
thus less information bits per chip. Moreover, the  
 
presence of trace impurities, including but not limited 
to particulates, metals, moisture, and other halocarbons 
in the plasma etchant, even when only present in the 
part per million level, increase the defect rate in the 
production of these higher density integrated circuits. 
As a result there has been continually increasing market 
demand for higher and higher purity etchants, and an 
increasing market value of materials having the required 
purity. Consequently, identification of the offending 
impurities and their removal represents a significant 
aspect of preparing the fluorine-containing compounds 
for these applications. Purification of halogenated hydrocarbon products 
has been the subject of considerable research. Of 
particular interest are the challenges presented in 
separating a halogenated hydrocarbon from materials such 
as impurities in the starting materials used to produce 
the halogenated hydrocarbon, excess reactants, and 
reaction by-products which are difficult to remove by 
standard separation methods
