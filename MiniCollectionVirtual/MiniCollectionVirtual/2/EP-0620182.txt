<ABSTRACT>
A scissor-type lifting table has at least two pairs of scissor arms 6, 7 and 8, 9 in each case connected to one another in a cross joint 4, 5. In opposite end areas, the pairs of scissor arms 6, 7 and 8, 9 are each supported at one end in a fixed position on a pivot bearing and at the other end via a loose bearing on a floor-side underframe 2 and a top table platform 3 respectively. The table platform 3 is formed with a drive-in space 13 for a pallet truck. The drive-in 13 space is defined in a U-shape by a marginal profile strip 14. In the plane of its free bottom edge areas 16, 18, the marginal profile strip 14 is connected to a plane support plate 17 spanning the drive-in space 13 at least in a certain area. At least one centre supporting member 15, 15'; 15'' running in the same plane as the top edges 21, 22 of the marginal profile strip 14 is provided on this support plate 17.

A scissor-type lifting table having at least two pairs of 
scissor arms (6,7 and 8,9) connected to each other in a 

respective universal joint (4,5) and which, in oppositely 
disposed en
d portions are respectively supported rigidly at 
one end on a pivot bearing and at the other via a loose 

bearing on a bottom frame (2) at the floor end and on an 
upper table top (3) respectively, said table top having, 

bounded in a U-shape by a marginal profile strip (14), an 
entrance space (13) for a fork-lift truck, characterised in 

that the marginal profile strip (14) is in the plane of its 
free bottom edge portions (16,18) connected to a flat 

carrier plate (17) extending across at least parts of the 
entrance space (13) and there is on this at least one 

bracing member (15,15';15'') extending in the same plane as 
the top edges (21,22) of the marginal profile strip (14). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that there are a plurality of bracing 

members (15,15') disposed in the longitudinal central plane 
(19) of the table top (3). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the bracing member (15,15';15'') is 

constructed as a profiled part having in cross-section an 
upper pressure-introducing surface (24) and at least one 

bracing strut (25,26) directed at the carrier plate (17). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that provided as the bracing member 

(15,15';15'') is a cylindrical body welded to the carrier 
plate (17) and providing a bottom plate (27) to serve as the 

pressure initiating surface (24).  
 
A scissor-type lifting table according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the bracing member is formed via a 

reshaping of the carrier plate (17). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the carrier plate (17) is on each 

side welded to the inner bottom edge portions (16,18) of the 
marginal profile strip (14). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that in a front part (28) of the carrier 

plate(17) extends between respective inner side members (30,31) 
of two longitudinal struts (32,33) of the U-shaped 

marginal profile strip (14), and in that a rear portion (34) 
of the carrier plate (17) engages under its cross strut 

(35). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the carrier plate (17) has a length 

dimension which is shortened in relation to the longitudinal 
struts (32,33) of the U-shaped marginal profile strip (14). 
A scissor-type lifting table according to one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that the bracing member (15';15'') is 

disposed close to a front marginal edge (36) of the carrier 
plate (17).
