<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to particular imidazolinone
compounds useful as fungicides, agriculturally suitable
compositions containing such compounds, and methods of
use of such compounds or compositions as fungicides in
crop plants.WO90/12791 is drawn to the use of fungicidal
compounds of Formula i

wherein:
A is O or NR4; andW is O or S.WO90/12791 also relates to processes for the
preparation of compounds of Formula i and to certain
novel compounds.The compounds of WO90/12791 are distinct from those
of the present invention in that oxygen is incorporated
into the central heterocyclic ring of compounds of
Formula i and the bonds forming this five-membered ring
are all single bonds.EP-A-0551048 forms part of the state of the art for
novelty-only purposes (Article 54(3) EPC), and
discloses racemic fungicidal 2-imidazoline-5-one and 2-imidazoline-5-thione
derivatives.This invention comprises compounds of Formula I
including all geometric and stereoisomers thereof,
agricultural compositions containing one or more such 
compounds, and methods of use of such compounds or
compositions as fungicides.The compounds of the present invention have the
following structure:
