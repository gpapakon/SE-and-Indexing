<ABSTRACT>
Method of producing pig iron (22) in a blast furnace (10). 
At least a portion of a top gas (42) from a blast furnace 

(10) is collected, dried and then heated to an elevated 
temperature preferably in the range of 900 - 1000°C. An 

oxygen-enriched hydrogenaceous fuel (32) is introduced into 
the furnace bosh (30) and the heated dried top gas (64) is 

introduced into the lower half of the furnace stack above 
the furnace bosh (30) at a point above which the coke (16) 

in the furnace (10) is not reactive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of reducing metal oxide in a blast furnace 
using an untreated top gas and an oxygen-enriched hydrogenaceous fuel. 
More particularly, the invention includes introducing an untreated heated top gas 
into the lower half of a blast furnace stack and introducing an oxygen-enriched 
hydrogenaceous fuel into a blast furnace bosh. The growth of so-called "minimills" has been rapid in recent years. One 
reason for this growth is because minimills produce steel by remelting ferrous 
scrap in an electric furnace rather than using molten pig iron produced in a blast 
furnace. On the other hand, most fully integrated large steel manufacturers 
require molten pig iron as a charge material for a steel converter such as a basic 
oxygen furnace. One of the primary reasons why blast furnaces no longer are 
being constructed in North America is because of the huge capital investment 
required. This not only includes capital for the furnace itself but also related 
equipment such as stoves for heating blast air and a coke producing oven. 
Another disadvantage is the maintenance expense associated with the stoves 
required to heat the blast air. British patent 1,216,779 discloses a method of operating a blast furnace at 
a pressure of at least 75 psi to produce molten pig iron. Oxygen, steam and 
optional fuel oil are blown through blast furnace tuyeres. Carbon dioxide 
allegedly is removed from the top gas using a scrubber and the remaining gas is 
recycled to the base of the furnace at a pressure exceeding that within the 
furnace. The patent discloses the need for blast furnace stoves may be reduced 
or eliminated. A major disadvantage associated with the operation of a blast furnace is the 
high energy cost associated with the use of coke in the furnace burden. The 
environmental problems associated with coke ovens for producing coke are well 
known. There has been much effort in recent years to reduce the consumption 
of coke and to increase the output of blast furnaces. Coke consumption in the 
furnace can be reduced by recycling the furnace generated top gas. Since top 
gas contains large amounts of carbon dioxide and water, this gas first must be 
regenerated with a carbon-containing material such as methane to make it more 
reducing before it can be injected into the furnace bosh. However, this requires  
 
the added capital expense of either a reformer or a gas separation unit. 
Accordingly, top gas generally is used for firing the stoves but not for reducing 
metal oxide in the
