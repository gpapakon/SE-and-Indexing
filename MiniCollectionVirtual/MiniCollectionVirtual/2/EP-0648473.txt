<ABSTRACT>
Blunt tip surgical needles which significantly 
reduce the probability of skin penetration of the gloved 

hand of an operator are disclosed. In one embodiment, the 
blunt tip needle includes a tip portion which terminates in 

a bulbous blunt tip. In another embodiment, the needle tip 
portion includes a ball socket and a ball rotatably 

disposed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to surgical 
needles and, more particularly, to blunt tip surgical 
needles wherein the needle has 
a ball tip that can roll on a surface, 
to decrease potential skin penetration of the gloved 
hand of an operator. Everyone today is well aware of the severity of 
contracting Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The members of 
professions that must deal on a daily basis with the risk 
of coming in contact with people that do or may have HIV or 
AIDS are acutely aware of the severity. Members of the 
medical profession, especially surgeons, are in an 
extremely high risk position when performing operations. 
The knowledge that infectious diseases such as the AIDS 
virus can spread by an accidentally inflicted needle stick 
from a contaminated needle administered to the person 
having AIDS is the cause for much concern for the 
profession. These professionals are therefore taking every 
precaution to reduce the risks. For example, the use of 
double gloving, blunt tipped needles and gloves thickened 
at the fingers are known to reduce the rate of glove  
 
puncture. In addition, the use of forceps designed to grip 
both the tissue and needle more effectively and the use of 
staples for skin closure are also known to reduce the 
incidence of glove puncture. A blunt-tipped stylet has been previously described (GB-A-2064963), 
to reduce perforation of the transvenous pacing 
lead through which it is threaded. The stylet tapers from 
the handle to a tip at which a ball is affixed, with a 
diameter substantially equal to that of the stylet at its 
widest point. There have also been developments in the area of surgical 
needle tip design. For example, U.S. Patent 4,828,547 to 
Sahi et al. discloses a needle having a blunting member 
which is moveable from a retracted position to an extended 
position. In the retracted position, the blunting member 
does not interfere with the puncture tip of the needle. In 
the extended position, the blunting member extends beyond 
the puncture tip and therefore acts as a guard against 
accidental needle sticks. Further examples of shield or 
guard type assemblies for syringe needles are disclosed in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,883,469 to Glazier and 4,883,471 to 
Braginetz et al. The devices disclosed above are useful for hypodermic 
syringe needles which are disposed of after a single stick. 
This design would not be practical for use with surgical 
needles since such needles must make repeated

<CLAIMS>
A surgical needle (40) comprising a tip portion (32) 
having a proximal (44) and a distal end (46) characterised 

in that the said distal end (46) has a ball socket (50) for 
the rotatable retention of a ball, and a ball (52) rotatably 

retained within said ball socket. 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 1, wherein 
the ball socket (50) includes a first bore (54) at an upper 

portion of the ball socket. 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 2, wherein 
said ball socket (50) further includes a concave shaped ball 

seat (56) at a bottom of the ball socket and contiguous with 
said first bore (54). 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 3, wherein 
the ball seat (56) has a shape selected from the group 

consisting of conical and spherical. 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 2, wherein 
said ball socket (62) further includes a second bore (68) 

and a circumferentially inwardly inclined support surface 
(64) disposed between and contiguous with the first (66) and 

second (68) bores. 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 5, further 
including a conical shaped lower surface (70) extending from 

a lower perimeter of said second bore (68). 
The surgical needle (40) according to any preceding 
claim, further including a suture mounting portion 

having a hole to which a suture is to be attached, 
and a body portion which is disposed between and 

contiguous with said suture mounting portion and said 
tip portion.  

 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 7, wherein 
said body portion has a generally uniform cross-sectional 

area throughout an entire length thereof. 
The surgical needle (40) according to claim 7 or claim 8 
wherein said cross-sectional area of said body portion 

has a shape selected from the group consisting of circular, 
square, rectangular, triangular and flat pressed circular. 
The surgical needle (40) according to any preceding 
claim, wherein said needle has an overall curved shape with 

a constant radius of curvature.
