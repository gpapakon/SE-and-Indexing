<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for testing semiconductor 
devices, especially overvoltage protectors, involves the 

application to the device (2) to be tested of a standard surge 
waveform which is truncated by terminating it early. The 

amount of heating of the device by the truncated surge 
waveform is ascertained by monitoring or measuring a heat 

sensitive parameter of the device during and/or shortly after 
the application of the waveform. Devices which undergo less 

heating are capable of withstanding higher electrical loads 
in service than those which become more heated. The early 

termination is effected by a controllable short circuit (8) 
operating on the standard waveform. The differential c
oefficient 
with respect to time of a heat sensitive parameter may 

be monitored continually during the truncated waveform and 
used to operate the short circuit even earlier if the 

differential coefficient exceeds a threshold value indicating 
an undue temperature rise in the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the testing of
semiconductor devices, and especially to testing them to
establish the conditions under which they would fail.Previously, semiconductor devices have been tested for
their ability to withstand large signals applied to them by
measuring some characteristic of the device, applying a
standard test signal to the device (for example, a CCITT K17
or IEEE PC62 surge waveforms) and then measuring the
characteristic again. The device is considered to be a
failure if the characteristic has been changed significantly
by the application of the test signal. The change in the
characteristic will of course be especially marked if the
device has been damaged by the test signal.A disadvantage of that form of test is that the results are
not reliable. For example, a device that reached an abnormally
high temperature while the test signal was applied
might show no, or have a only a small, change in the measured
characteristic after application of the test signal, which
would be taken as indicating a good device, whereas, in fact,
the high temperature reached may have melted the contact
metallisation of the device, thereby changing the connections
to it so as to leave only a small area of contact. Such a
device would be likely to fail early in service.Another disadvantage of the test described above is that
devices that are weak will be damaged or destroyed by the 
test. Some of those devices might otherwise have been suitable for use under less demanding
conditions than those expected for devices that passed the test.DE-A-3832273 discloses a method of measuring the collector emitter voltage of an insulated
gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with the IGBT in the cold state and again after the application
of an electrical power pulse of defined duration and power. The thermal resistance of the
IGBT component is determined as the difference of the voltage multiplied by a constant and
divided by the power of the applied pulse. The constant is previously determined for the
IGBT, or for a typical example, by measuring a calibration curve of collector-emitter voltage
versus temperature. The constant is derived from the curve using a certain temperature
difference. This method is used to determine internal stationary and transient thermal
resistance of IGBT.A transient thermal impedance tester design and its general capabilities are also described in
the article "Transient Thermal Impedance Tester for Power IC Packages" (1993 PROC 43rd
