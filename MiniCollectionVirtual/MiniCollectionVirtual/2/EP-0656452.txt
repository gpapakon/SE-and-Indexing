<ABSTRACT>
A tiling panel (1), in which the tiles (6) are arranged on a sheet-like structure, gaps being formed between them, in particular for use as a house-facade panel which is fastened on a lath arrangement (4) which is fitted on the house wall and consists of wood or the like, is characterised in that the sheet-like structure consists of a material which is of an increased strength and exhibits a grid-like hole arrangement which serves for the through-passage of moisture and for fastening, with the result that a tile panel (1) is provided which is distinguished by simple handling since the sheet-like structure is of an increased strength and thus the arrangement of the individual tiles (6) with respect to one another is ensured even in the event of extreme loading, and this together with simultaneous good ventilation of the floor or wall or surface to be clad.

on the outside and on the inside of which a material
layer (8) is provided, characterized in that the holes

(3) on the other hand serve to permit the passage of
air and moisture and that the material layer (8)

permits the passage of air and moisture and that the
perforated plate (2) is attached to a wooden structure

(4) which is a slatting spaced by masonry (5) to
enable a chimney-style draught.
A tiling panel according to claim 1, characterized in
that the material layer (8) is directly applied to the

perforated plate in order to serve as a stopper for
mortar.

A tiling panel according to claim 4, characterized in
that the coating (8) is moisture-permeable in both

directions.
A tiling panel according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the slatting (4) at

least consists of slats (4b) vertically attached to
the masonry (5).
A tiling panel according to claim 6, characterized in
that the slatting (4) also has horizontal slats (4a)

wherein the number of vertical slats (4b) is greater
than the number of horizontal slats (4a).
