<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated process 
for the production of isoolefin by the dehydration of 
a tertiary alcohol and the synthesis of a corresponding ether. 
More particularly the invention relates to the first stage 
concurrent dehydration of tertiary butyl alcohol, recovery 
of isobutene and the second stage concurrent etherification 
of the recovered isobutene with an alcohol and recovery of 
ether. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is a useful component 
for improving the octane of gasolines and has commonly been 
prepared by the acid catalyzed reaction of methanol with 
isobutene. Examples of such a process are disclosed in 
U.S. Patents 4,039,590 and 4,198,530. Recently a new method of carrying out catalytic 
reactions has been developed, wherein the components of the 
reaction system are concurrently separable by distillation, 
using the catalyst structures as the distillation 
structures. This method is now generally known as 
catalytic distillation and any reference to catalytic 
distillation herein will be taken to mean this method or 
process. Such systems are described variously in U.S. 
Patents 4,215,011; 4,232,177; 4,242,530; 4,302,356; 
4,307,254; 4,336,407; 4,439,350; 4,443,559; and 4,482,775. 
U.S. Patent 4,447,668 discloses the dissociation of ethers 
in a catalytic distillation column. US Pat. No. 3,267,156 discloses the preparation of 
dialkyl ethers by dehydration over acid resin catalyst at 
250 to 400°F. U.S. Pat. No. 4,827,048 discloses the production of MTBE 
using heteropoly acid catalyst on an inert support to 
dehydrate methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol in a  
 
straight pass reaction at 120°F+. U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,244 disclosed MTBE production by reacting methanol and tertiary 
butyl alcohol in a rectification tower in a packed bed. U.S. 4012456 describes a method for the separation of isobutylene from C4 
hydrocarbon fractions. In the described method isobutylene is seperated from the hydrocarbon 
in the presence of a polar solvent. The resultant reaction mixture contains tertiary butyl 
alcohol and water. This mixture is added to a dehydration reactor which is a vertical 
cylindrical apparatus having rectification and reaction sections. The upper, ie the reaction 
section, is filled with moulded ion-exchange catalyst. Briefly, the present invention is a process for the production of ether comprising the 
steps of: 
(a) feeding a tertiary alcohol to a first distillation column reactor into a feed zone; (b) concurrently in said first distillation column
