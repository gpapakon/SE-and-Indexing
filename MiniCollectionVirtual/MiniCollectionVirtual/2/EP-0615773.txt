<ABSTRACT>
Ski or other board for sliding over snow, including a protective and decorative top or shell. This top or shell consists of a multi-layer complex (7) which includes at least one opening (9) in the upper plastic layer (2). This upper layer (2) is transparent and it protects the decoration upstream (3) and downstream (4) of the central zone (6) which includes the underfoot zone (6).

Ski or other board for gliding over snow, comprising a top 
or shell (10) for protection and decoration which is made of 

plastics material, 

this top or shell (10) comprising a multilayer complex (7) 
formed from a laminate of flat plastic layers (8, 2), 
and at least the upper layer (2) of the laminate being 
perforated or interrupted at at least one place (9, 19), thus 

defining in this complex (7) at least one window (19) or 
interruption (9) which allows at least one of the subjacent 

layers (8) of this laminate (7) to be seen on this gliding 
board (1). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said upper layer (2) of the 

multilayer complex (7) is a transparent plastic layer for 
protecting the decoration of this gliding board (1). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that this transparent plastic layer 

(2) is at least interrupted in the central zone (5) which 
comprises the runner zone (6). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to 
Claim 3, characterized in that this transparent plastic layer 

is in addition interrupted in the median longitudinal zones of 
the front (17) and/or the rear (18) of the board (1). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the lower layer (8, 

21) of the laminate (7) arrives, in the openings (9) or windows 
(19), at the same level as said upper layer (2). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the lower layer (8, 

21) of the laminate (7) arrives, in the openings (9) or windows 
(19), above said upper layer (2). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the multilayer  

 
complex (7) comprises more than two layers (21, 8, 2), in that 

the upper layer (2) and the lower layer (21) of this multilayer 
complex are both transparent, and in that at least one of the 

openings or windows (19) is cut out in all the layers (8, 2) 
which cover this lower layer (21), with the result that, 

finally, said transparent upper layer (2) protects at least a 
portion of the decoration of the board, while said lower layer 

(21) allows a portion (22) of the inner part of the ski to be 
seen, while protecting it. 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to 
Claim 7, characterized in that this portion of the inner part 

of the ski comprises a technical element (22) of the ski, such 
as for example a plate for absorbing vibrations or a plate 

intended for screwing the bindings. 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to 
Claim 7 or Claim 8, characterized in that, where said openings 

or windows (19) are located, these two transparent layers (2, 
21) are at the same level, one (21) to some extent continuing 

the other (2). 
Ski or other board for gliding over snow according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that at least the upper 

layer (2) of the multilayer complex (7) is visually different 
from the other layer or layers (8) of this multilayer complex. 
Process for manufacturing by moulding a ski (1) or other 

board for gliding over snow, according to any one of Claims 1 
to 10 and comprising at least: 


a sole (12) for gliding, possibly bordered by edges (13), 
a central core (15), 
one or more reinforcing layers (14, 11), 
a plastic shell or top (10) for protection and decoration, 
 
this process consisting, at least, in manner known per se: 


either, in the so-called "wet method": 

in successively stacking in the open mould the sole 
(12), possibly bordered by the edges (13), one or more lower 

reinforcing layers (14), the solid core (15) bordered by  
 

possible side elements, one or more upper reinforcing layers 
(11), and finally said plastic top or shell (10), the assembly 

of these elements being pre-glued, 
then in closing the mould with the aid of its lid and 
under high pressure, in raising the temperature, etc... 
or, in the "injection-moulding" mode: 

in placing in the open mould the sole (12), possibly 
bordered by the edges (13), and one or more lower reinforcing 

layers (14) pre-assembled or pre-glued together and to the sole 
(12), then said plastic shell (10) pre-assembled with one or 

more upper reinforcing layers (11), bending this shell (10) to 
introduce it into the mould until it descends to the height of 

the edges of the sole (12), thus defining a hollow inner space 
defined by this shell, 
then in closing the mould with the aid of its lid and in 
injecting, under high pressure and in this inner space, the 

liquid components of a synthetic foam which, on expanding, 
forms the core (15), while applying said shell (10) against the 

inner face of the lid, etc... 
 
characterized in that this plastic top or shell (10) is, at 

least in its upper part, taken in the sense of its thickness, 
made of a multilayer complex (7) formed by a laminate of 

successive layers (8, 2), at least the upper layer (2) of this 
laminate (7) presenting at least one discontinuity made in the 

form of a window (19) or interruption (9), which, finally, 
makes it possible to leave bare, after demoulding, at least one 

judiciously chosen piece of at least one of the subjacent 
layers (8) of this multilayer complex (7). 
Process according to Claim 11, carried out in accordance 
with said "injection-moulding" mode, characterized in that, in 

order to obtain a uniform level for the upper surface of this 
board (1) despite the presence of said discontinuities (9, 19), 

the inner face of the lid presents a uniform surface, with the 
result that, during injection of the core (15), the pressure 

(P) due to this injection draws into these discontinuities (9,  
 

19), the lower layer (8) of the laminate (7), this lower layer 
(8) then "rising" in each of these discontinuities (9, 19) in 

order finally to arrive, on the finished board, at the same 
level as the upper layer (2) of the laminate. 
Process according to Claim 11, carried out in accordance 
with the "wet method" mode, characterized in that, in order to 

obtain a uniform level for the upper surface of this board (1) 
despite the presence of said discontinuities (9, 19), an 

additional reinforcing layer (16) is placed in the mould 
beneath each discontinuity (9, 19), this additional layer (16) 

being substantially of the same dimensions as the corresponding 
discontinuity (9, 19).
