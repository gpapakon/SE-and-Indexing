<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metering system with a doctor element designed as a doctor rod for coating material webs, which are guided over at least one roll which is assigned to the doctor element, the doctor element being held in a bed which is carried by a holder which is designed in one piece with the bed and which is held on one wall of a clamp which is simultaneously one boundary wall of the opening channel for the coating compound, the holder having at its end a clamping or tensioning surface on its side opposite the clamping wall. The invention is characterised in that, in the region of the end of the clamping wall bounding the supply channel, the holder has a step change in thickness and has there, at its side opposite the said clamping or tensioning surface, an extension which is designed with a bevel which forms an angle between 15 and 55 DEG  with the boundary wall of the holder which is on the side opposite the clamping or tensioning surface, this boundary wall surface being flush with the wall surface of the clamping wall.

A metering system with a doctor element designed 
as a doctor rod for coating webs of material which are 

guided over at least one roller which is associated 
with the doctor element, the doctor element (1) being 

held in a bed (2) which is borne by a holder (3) which 
is held on a wall (8) in a clamping means which at the 

same time is one limiting wall of the opening duct (4) 
for the coating substance, the holder (3) having a 

clamping or gripping surface on its end on the side 
located opposite the clamping wall (8), characterised 

in that in the region of the end of the clamping wall 
(8) limiting the feed duct (4) the holder (3) has a 

step in thickness and has there on its side located 
opposite said clamping or gripping surface a 

continuation (6), the side of which which is remote 
from the clamping or gripping surface of the holder (3) 

is flush with the corresponding side limiting surface 
of the holder and with the corresponding side limiting 

surface of the clamping wall (8). 
A metering system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the continuation (6) is designed 

with a slope which forms an angle of between 15 and 55Â° 
with the limiting wall of the holder (3) which is 

located on the side opposite the clamping or gripping 
surface. 
A metering system according to Claim 3 [sic], 

characterised in that the clamping wall (8) on its end 
facing the continuati
on (6) is matched to the slope 
thereof and has the corresponding inclination, so that 

the inclined wall section of the continuation (6) lies 
fully against the clamping wall (8).  

 
A metering system according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the continuation (6) of the 

holder (3) is designed as a point (7). 
A metering system according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that a groove is provided at the 

transition between the continuation (6) and the side of 
the holder (3) adjacent to the clamping or gripping 

surface. 
A metering system according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the holder (3) is formed of 

one piece with the bed (2).
