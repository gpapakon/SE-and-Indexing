<ABSTRACT>
A radiant energy redirecting system comprising a radiant energy transmitting body structure (10) comprising multiple elements (11), each of which acts as a radiant energy redirecting module, having on its cross-sectional perimeter an entry face (12) to receive incidence of the energy into the interior of the perimeter, an exit face (13) to pass the energy to the exterior of the perimeter in a direction towards the reverse side of the body from the side of the incidence, and a Totally Internally Reflecting face (41) angled relative to the entry and exit faces to redirect towards the exit face the redirecting incident radiant energy towards a predetermined target zone (15) situated apart from and on the reverse side of the body relative to the side of the incidence; and lens structure associated with at least one of the faces for redirecting radiant energy passing between the entry and exit faces via the Totally Internally Reflecting face.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radiant, particularly
electromagnetic, energy concentration, redirection,
and manipulation, and improves over the subject matters
of U.S. Patent 4,377,759
and of an article "Compact non-imaging Lens with Totally Internally Reflecting
Facets" by W. Parkyn et al. in SPIE,
Vol. 1528, pages 70 to 81.
It more particularly concerns
a system
for employing a transparent
means with elements thereof using Total Internal Reflection
(TIR), in conjunction with refraction; such
elements acting in concert with purely refractive elements
(as those in a Fresnel lens) and/or metal mirrors
to redirect radiant energy to or from a predetermined
zone or zones; such redirection having a predetermined
degree of concentration and/or chromatic dispersion.
The zones have sources of light, as in photoillumination,
or radiant energy receiving means for conversion of the
redirected energy to thermal, electric, chemical, or mechanical
forms. Alternatively, a further transparent
means is employed, with elements thereof having the
same design principle (TIR) as above; said further transparent
means acting as a secondary radiation redirector
for the purpose of magnifying the degree of concentration
and/or chromatic dispersion of the radiant energy
redirected by the primary transparent means.The prior art of radiant energy concentration and illumination
in general consists of two major types, as exemplified
by refractive and reflective astronomical telescopes:
a refractive lens positioned in front of a receiver
or light source, or a retro-reflective mirror positioned behind
a receiver or light source. The corresponding devices
in the prior art of solar energy concentration are
the Fresnel lens and the parabolic reflector, which focus
solar energy on a target. Furthermore, there are non-imaging,
reflecting concentrators that have the advantage
of fixed daily (non-tracking) position with only seasonal
adjustments, but the disadvantage of requiring relatively
large reflector areas and delivering only relatively
low energy concentrations.Fresnel lenses are devices comprising purely refractive
elements, but they have physically inherent limitations
of redirecting radiant energy that give high f/ratios
and bulky concentrator structure. Moveover, linear
Fresnel lenses have, for off-angles in the direction of the
grooves, focusing errors, that are also inherent in the
laws of refraction, and that limit one-axis tracking configurations
to relatively low concentration.Parabolic reflector concentrators have seen

A radiant energy redirecting system comprising

a) a radiant energy transmitting body means
(740,760,780,850)
b) said body means
comprising multiple contiguous elements

each of which defines a facet (742 to 746) and
acts as a radiant energy redirecting module,

having on its cross-sectional perimeter an entry
face (742a,743a,786) to

receive incidence of said energy into the interior
of said perimeter, an exit face

to pass said energy
to the exterior of said perimeter in a direction

towards the reverse side of the body from
the side of said incidence, and a Totally Internally

Reflecting face (742b,743b,787)
angled relative to said entry

and exit faces to redirect towards said exit face
the radiant energy incident from said entry face,
c) said body means generally redirecting incident
radiant energy towards a predetermined

target zone situated apart from and on
the reverse side of said body relative to the side

of said incidence,
d) the Totally Internally Reflecting face (742b,743b,787) and
the entry face (742a,743a,786) being located at

the same side of a facet (742 to 746), 
e) the facets (742 to 746) being concentrically arranged
relative to a central axis (751),
f) the body (740, 760, 780, 850) having an exit surface (747,
759, 785) at its reverse side, said exit surface subtending all

of said facets, and said exit faces being on said exit surface,
g) the Totally Internally Reflecting face (742b, 743b, 787)
and the entry face (742a, 743a, 786) converging at each facet

to form a tip (742d, 743d, 746d), and said tips lying
progressively closer to a plane (750, 766, 790) normal to the

outward facet (746),
h) said Totally Internally Reflecting faces (742b, 743b, 787)
of the facets (742 to 746) defining a lens means and being

concave toward the entry faces (742a, 743a, 786) in planes
including said central axis (751),

   
characterized in that
i) said entry faces (742a, 743a, 786) of the facets (742 to
746) are convex toward the Totally Internally Reflecting faces

The system of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
Totally Internally Reflecting face (742b,743b,787)

is a body boundary, so that
the index of refraction "n" of the substance of said

transparent body means at said boundary gives total
internal reflection of all radiant energy whose incident

angle with the normal of said boundary at the
point of incidence exceeds Brewster's angle, which

equals the inverse sine of the reciprocal of "n". 
The system of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
elements join contiguously to form a radiant energy

transmitting cover means with an entry surface and
said exit surface lying on opposed sides of said cover

means, which cover means causes radiant energy
leaving the exit surface to have a generally different

direction than it did at incidence upon said entry surface.

entry and/or exit faces are individually angled relative

to the radiant energy passing through them so
as to cause refractive redirection of said radiant energy.
