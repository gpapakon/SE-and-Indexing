<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for dividing a flow of fibrous material into at least two equally metered flows includes a substantially horizontal pulp feeder press with a plug pipe outlet connected to an upper portion of a substantially vertical housing and at least two metering screws arranged in a metering housing at the bottom of the vertical housing. The vertical housing comprises at least one rapid rotating spreader screw and a spreader disc mounted at the lower end of each spreader screw for conveying compressed fibrous material from the pulp feeder press while at the same time providing shearing action to disintegrate the compressed material and for distribution of the disintegrated material into the metering housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of precisely 
dividing a flow of fiberous material into two or more equally 
measured flows. In many industrial applications it is necessary to 
divide flow of materials into equal smaller flows. This 
normally is accomplished by volumetric metering screws. 
However, this method becomes useless when material for reasons 
of process requirement first is processed and dewatered through 
a screw press or a plug feeder. Material running through this 
equipment will drastically alter its density. That will result 
in uneven density, which no volumetric metering screw can 
properly handle. Such operation is nowhere more important than 
in the refining of woodchips or other cellulostic material in a 
twin flow refiner, i.e. a refiner having one rotating rotor 
element between two stationary elements, thereby forming two 
grinding zones. A twin flow refiner relies entirely on the mat of 
fiberous material being fed to each side of the rotating rotor 
element, where the grinding zones are contained. It is 
imperative to maintain the gaps of the two grinding zones 
within one half thousandth of an inch, otherwise an inferior 
fiber quality will be produced. Although each stationary side 
of the gap of the grinding zones is individually controlled by 
a servo mechanism, the rotating rotor position is entirely 
dependent on the fiberous mat maintained continuously in the 
two grinding zones. Uneven flow of each zone will result in 
disastrous fibre quality problems. The present invention concerns a device that will 
restore the homogenius density of the wood chips and fiberous 
material after being processed and dewatered through the screw 
press or plug feeder and at the same time spread the material 
evenly into two or more metering screws. It has been found that 
this device provides improvement in fibre quality with superior 
paper tensile strength.  
 It is the object of the present invention to provide a 
disintegrating zone to obtain an even density of the incoming 
material flow and spread the material evenly into the metering 
screws. In accordance with the aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a spreader screw, breaking up or 
disintegrating an incoming continuously formed plug of material 
into individual chips or defibrated fibers. At the end of the screw an impeller type disc is 
provided for distribution of the material evenly around the 
inside wall of an expanded cylindrical chamber. The material 
falls by gravity evenly into the metering
