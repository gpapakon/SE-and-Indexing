<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for holding a cylindrical laser tube (3) in a stable radiation direction in the cylindrical inner chamber of a metallic housing (2). The inner chamber has a larger diameter than the laser tube (3). At the end areas of the inner chamber, O-rings (4) are fitted for mounting the laser tube (3) and the metallic housing (2) is mounted on a base plate (1). The device is characterised in that the intermediate space enclosed by the O-rings between the laser tube (3) and the metallic housing (2) is filled with a thermoconductive paste (16), controllable heating and cooling elements are arranged in contact with the outer wall of the housing (2) and only one side of the housing (2) is mounted in a stationary manner on the base plate (1).

Device for the retention of a cylindrical laser tube (3), stably in 
direction of the beam, in the cylindrical interior space of a metallic 

housing (2), wherein the interior space has a greater diameter than the 
laser tube (3) and O-rings (4) for the bearing of the laser tube (3) are 

fitted into the end regions of the interior space and the metallic 
housing (2) is borne on a base plate (1), characterised thereby, that 

the intermediate space, which is enclosed by the 0-rings, to the laser 
tube (3) within the metallic housing (2) is filled out by a thermally 

conductive paste (16), controllable heating and cooling elements are 
mounted in contact with the outward wall surface of the housing (2) and 

the housing (2) is borne at only one side in fixed location on the base 
plate (1). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that at least 
one Peltier element (5) is provided as heating and cooling element. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that several 
Peltier elements (5) are provided in a symmetrical arrangement. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised thereby, that a 
respective cooling body (6) with outwardly facing cooling ribs is 

associated with each of the Peltier elements (5). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the housing 
(2) rests by way of thermally insulating feet (7) on the base plate (1). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the outward 
wall surface of the housing (2) with the exception of the contact 

surfaces for the heating and cooling elements is provided with a 
thermally insulating coat (10).  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the base 
plate (1) with the exception of the bearing places for the housing (2) 

is provided with a thermally insulating coat (11). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the housing 
(2) displays a nearly square cross-section.
