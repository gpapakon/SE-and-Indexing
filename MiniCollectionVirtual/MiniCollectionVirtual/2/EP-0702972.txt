<ABSTRACT>
A safety shield (10) is provided for an elongate needle cannula (12) having a 
proximal end and a sharply pointed distal tip (14). The safety shield includes an 

anchor (26) fixedly disposed near the proximal end of the needle cannula. The safety 
shield further includes a tip guard (24) that is slidably movable along the needle 

cannula from a proximal position near the anchor to a distal position where the 
tip guard protectively surrounds the distal tip of the needle cannula. An 

elongate spring tether (28) formed from a resiliently deflectable material has a 
proximal end connected to the anchor and a distal end connected to the tip 

guard. The spring tether is deflected into a loop about an axis extending 
orthogonal to the needle cannula when the tip guard is in the proximal position. 

The spring tether has a length which permits the tip guard to slide into its distal 
position without sliding completely of the distal end of the needle cannula. 

Resiliency of the spring tether keeps the tip guard in its proximal position. 
However, after sufficient manually generated movement of the tip guard in a 

distal direction, the resiliency of the spring tether will propel the tip guard into 
its distal position for safely shielding the tip of the needle cannula.

<DESCRIPTION>
1.   Field of the Invention. The subject invention relates to single-handedly
actuatable safety shields for needles to prevent accidental needle
sticks.2.   Description of the Prior Art. Accidental sticks with a used
medical implement can transmit disease. Consequently many prior art
hypodermic needles, blood collection needles, catheter needles and other
sharply pointed medical implements are provided with a safety shield. The
safety shield is intended to be placed over the sharply pointed tip of the medical
implement immediately after removing the medical implement from the patient.Some prior art safety shields define a rigid cap that can be telescoped in
a proximal direction over the point of the needle cannula or other such medical
implement. This re-shielding procedure requires the health care worker to hold
the pointed medical implement in one hand and the shield in the other. The
hands are then moved toward one another to effect the shielding. However, a
misalignment during the shielding procedure could cause the accidental stick
that the shield is intended to avoid. Additionally, this prior art shield
presupposes that the health care worker will have two free hands to complete
the shielding and that the shield will be readily available when the needle
cannula or other such pointed implement is removed from the patient. In fact,
many medial procedures require the health care worker to apply pressure to the
penetration site immediately after the needle has been removed. Thus, the
health care worker will apply pressure with one hand while manipulating the
medical implement with the other hand. The unshielded needle may be placed
on a nearby surface for shielding at a later time. This re-shielding easily can be
overlooked as the health care worker attends to other needs of the patient.
Additionally, the needle shield easily can be moved or misplaced between the
initial unshielding and the intended reshielding. Other prior art needle shields remain attached to the medical implement
to avoid loss. The attachment may be a simple tether extending between the
above described shield and the medical implement. Upon completion of a
medical procedure, the health care worker will perform the two-handed
telescoping of the tethered shield in a proximal direction over the point of the
needle. This prior art shield avoids problems associated with loss. However,
shielding cannot be completed until the health care worker has two free hands
and the above-described potential exists for an accidental needle stick

<CLAIMS>
A safety shield (10) comprising an elongate needle cannula (12) having a
proximal end and an opposed distal tip (14);


an anchor (26) disposed substantially adjacent said proximal end of said needle
cannula (12);
a guard (24) slidably movable along said needle cannula (12) from a proximal
position substantially adjacent said anchor (26) to a distal position where said tip guard

(24) protectively encloses said distal tip (14) of said needle cannula (12); and
an elongate spring tether (28) formed from a resiliently deflectable material, said
spring tether (28) having a proximal end connected to said anchor (26) and a distal end

connected to said guard (24), said spring tether (28) defining a length for permitting said
guard (24) to slidably move into said distal position while preventing complete

separation of said guard (24) from said needle cannula (12), and whereby said resiliency
of said spring tether (28) propels said guard (24) to said distal position.

   
characterised in that
 said spring tether (28) is deflectable into a loop and about
an axis substantially orthogonal to said needle cannula (12) when said guard (24) is in

said proximal position and 
in that
 the resiliency of the spring tethers (28) propels that
guard (24) to the distal position after an initial distal movement of said guard (24)

toward said distal position.
The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said anchor (26), said guard
(24) and said spring tether (28) are unitary with one another and formed of plastic

material.
The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said spring tether (28) is
formed from fiber glass.
The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said spring tether (28) is
formed from a resilient metallic wire. 
The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said guard (24) includes an
actuator tab (36) projecting generally transversely away from said needle cannula (12)

for manually urging said guard (24) distally away from said proximal position and
against said biasing forces of said spring tether (28).
The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said needle cannula (12)
includes a mounting hub (16) affixed to said proximal end of said needle cannula (12),

said anchor (26) being securely connected to said needle hub (16).
The safety shield (10) of Claim 6 wherein said anchor (26) is unitary

The safety shield (10) of Claim 1, wherein said guard (24) includes a
spring lock (46) disposed therein, said spring lock (46) being biased to contact said

needle cannula (12) as said guard (24) moves from said proximal position toward said
distal position, said spring lock (46) being configured for biasingly engaging over said

distal tip of said needle cannula (12) when said guard (24) is in said distal position to
prevent proximal motion of said guard (24).
The safety shield (10) of Claim 8, wherein said guard (24) defines a
generally cylindrical cap (29) surrounding said needle cannula (12), said spring lock

(46) being lockingly retained within said cap (29) of said guard (24).
