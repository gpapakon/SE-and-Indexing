<ABSTRACT>
Catalytic (catalyst) composition of the Raney type for hydrogenation. This catalyst may originate from an Ni/Al/Mo alloy in which the Al/Mo weight ratio is higher than or equal to 1, preferably 2 and, still more preferably, is between 2 and 3. This invention makes it possible to limit the hydrodehalogenation problems and therefore, especially, to increase the yield and the lifetime of the catalyst. Application to the production of haloaminoaromatics useful especially in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical field.
