<ABSTRACT>
A computer system includes a license manager for regulating 
usage of software items. The license manager checks the host 

identity of the computer on which it runs and permits usage 
only if the host identity matches an identity value in a 

license key. The host identity of the computer is supplied 
by a security identification device removably coupled to an 

external port on the computer. Communication of the host 
identity between the security identifier device and the 

license manager is protected by encryption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a license management mechanism for
a computer system, for controlling use of licensed software.Software is normally licensed rather than sold in order that
restrictions on unauthorised use can be legally enforced.
Various schemes have been tried to make the software enforce
these restrictions itself, including copy protection,
hardware keys, etc., but the current trend is to the use of
license keys that are packets of data which permit the
software to work only on a particular machine.One way in which this has been implemented is through the
provision of a mechanism referred to as a license manager to
which the handling of these license keys is delegated. By
centralising the handling of the license keys it is possible
to restrict the use of software not just to a single machine
but to a network of machines. This provides additional
flexibility for the user as well as providing the potential
for more sophisticated control over the use of the software
within a user organisation.Central to the use of license managers to control the use of
software in this way is the ability to identify which machine
the license manager is running on. If this were not done it
would be possible to obtain license keys for use on one
machine and use them on any number of machines. Various
schemes have been used to achieve this identification,
including serial numbers built into the machine processor, 
use of Ethernet DTE addresses, etc.US-A-4924378 describes a licence storage key, for securely storing
information about what licences are available. The licence
storage key is connected to an external mouse/keyboard port.
Before an application program can be run, it accesses a licence
management daemon, which in turn accesses the licence storage key
to have a licence assigned. Also, while the application program
is running, it periodically checks with the daemon, to ensure that
a licence is still assigned to it. This ensures that if the user
removes the key while a program is running, the right to run that
program is lost. However, a problem with this is that the licence
storage key is a relatively complex device, capable of securely
storing a number of licences, one for each program.The object of the present invention is to provide a novel licence
management mechanism for a computer system, whereby this problem
is avoided. According to the invention there is provided a computer system
comprising:
(a) a host computer;(b) a security device removably coupled to an external port of the
host computer; and(c)
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A computer system comprising:

(a) a host computer (10);
(b) a security device (26) removably coupled to an external port
of the host computer; and
(c) a licence manager (20), running within the host computer, the
licence manager including means for responding to requests from

application programs by checking whether those application
programs are licensed and, if so, granting permission for those

application programs to run;

characterised in that

(d) the security device contains a host identity;
(e) the licence manager uses a licence table (22), stored within
the memory of the host computer, for checking whether application

programs are licensed; and
(f) the licence manager includes means for periodically
interrogating the security device, to obtain said host identity,

and for withdrawing permission for application programs to run if
the host identity does not match an expected identity value held

in the licence manager.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein communication of the
host identity between the security identification device and the

licence manager is protected by encryption.
A system according to Claim 2 wherein said host identity
returned by the security identification device is encrypted

together with a sequence number which is incremented each time
said host identity is returned.
A system according to any preceding claim wherein the licence
manager regulates the usage of software items within a network of

computers.
