<ABSTRACT>
A blanket-mounting mechanism (S) includes a dragging shaft (T),
a rotating device (A), a correction device (B), and a deflection

suppression device (C). A dragging-shaft accommodation bore (1a)
extends axially through a blanket cylinder (1). A blanket

insertion groove (1b) extends axially on the outer circumferential
surface of the blanket cylinder and extends radially to the

dragging-shaft accommodation bore. The dragging shaft has a
blanket-end reception groove (6) formed on the outer

circumferential surface and adapted to receive one end of a
blanket. The dragging shaft is inserted into the dragging-shaft

accommodation bore with an appropriate gap maintained
therebetween and is supported rotatably. The rotating device

is disposed at the side of one end face of the blanket
cylinder and is connected to the dragging shaft. The

correction device is disposed at the side of the other end
face of the blanket cylinder and is able to grip/release the

dragging shaft so as to adjust the angular position of the
dragging shaft. The deflection suppression device supports

the dragging shaft accommodated within the dragging-shaft
accommodation bore while permitting the dragging shaft to

rotate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blanket-mounting mechanism for mounting a blanket onto a blanket cylinder of an offset press.Conventional blanket-mounting mechanisms are known in which a blanket is mounted onto a blanket cylinder in the following manner. One end of the blanket is appropriately attached to the blanket cylinder. The blanket is wound onto the outer circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder. The other end of the blanket is inserted into a groove formed in a single dragging shaft disposed within the blanket cylinder. The dragging shaft is rotated so as to wind the blanket into the blanket cylinder, thereby mounting the blanket onto the blanket cylinder. Such a blanket-mounting mechanism and a blanket are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 61-133332 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 7-285214.The blanket-mounting mechanism disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 61-133332 includes a hollow dragging shaft, a torsion bar, and an adjustment mechanism. The dragging shaft is disposed in a groove which extends axially in the blanket cylinder and opens at the circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder. The opposite ends of the dragging shaft are rotatably supported by the opposite end portions of the blanket cylinder. The torsion bar is coaxially disposed within a hollow portion of the dragging shaft. One end of the torsion bar is connected to one end of the dragging shaft. The other end of the torsion bar projects from the other end of the dragging shaft. Via the adjustment mechanism, the projecting end of the torsion bar is attached to the corresponding end portion of the blanket cylinder, which end portion rotatably supports the other end of the dragging shaft. The adjustment mechanism is adapted to adjust the angular displacement of the torsion bar.One end of the dragging shaft projects from the corresponding end portion of the blanket cylinder, which end portion rotatably supports the one end of the dragging shaft. A worm wheel is attached to the projecting end of the dragging shaft. A removable handled worm can be engaged with the worm wheel.The blanket is mounted onto the blanket cylinder in the following manner. One end of the blanket is fixedly fitted into a groove which is axially formed in the circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder. The blanket cylinder is rotated so as to wind the blanket onto the outer circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder. The handled worm is set

<CLAIMS>
A blanket-mounting mechanism (5) comprising:

a blanket cylinder (1) having a dragging-shaft accommodation bore (1a) and a blanket insertion groove (1b), the dragging-shaft accommodation bore extending axially through the blanket cylinder, and the blanket insertion groove extending axially on an outer circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder and extending radially to said dragging-shaft accommodation bore;
a dragging shaft (T) having a blanket-end reception groove (6) formed on an outer circumferential surface, the blanket-end reception groove having an appropriate width and depth so as to receive one end of a blanket(W) to be mounted on the blanket cylinder, said dragging shaft being inserted into said dragging-shaft accommodation bore with an appropriate gap maintained therebetween, and rotatably-supported opposite end portions of said dragging shaft projecting from corresponding end faces of the blanket cylinder;
rotating means (A) disposed at a side of one end face of the blanket cylinder and connected to the corresponding end portion of said dragging shaft so as to rotate said dragging shaft; and 
characterised by
correction means (B) disposed at a side of the other end face of the blanket cylinder, said correction means comprising an angular-displacement member attached to the corresponding end portion of said dragging shaft in such a manner as to be able to grip/release the end portion of said dragging shaft, and adjusting means for angularly displacing and positioning said angular-displacement member about said dragging shaft.
A blanket-mounting mechanism according to claim 1 wherein one of two side walls (1c, 1e) that define said blanket insertion groove (1b) is substantially parallel to a plane tangent to said dragging-shaft accommodation bore (1a), and the other side wall extends in a radial direction
 of the blanket cylinder and toward the center of the dragging-shaft accommodation bore, so that said blanket insertion groove assumes a wedged cross section that converges towards the outer circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder.
A blanket-mounting mechanism according to claim 1 or 2 further comprising deflection suppression means (C) disposed in the blanket cylinder in at least one axial position, said deflection suppression means facing a circumferential surface of said dragging shaft (T) accommodated within said dragging-shaft accomodation bore (1a) with a small gap formed therebetween, said deflection suppression means permitting rotation of said dragging shaft while restricting deflection of the dragging shaft to an amount corresponding to the small gap.
A blanket-mounting mechanism according to claim 3, wherein said deflection suppression means (C) is mounted at a central axial position of the dragging shaft accommodation bore (1a).
A blanket-mounting mechanism according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said deflection suppression means (C) is a block (16) fitted in a depression formed in the blanket cylinder (1), and the block has a cylindrically curved inner surface which is concentric with said dragging-shaft accommodation bore, which has a diameter smaller that that of said dragging-shaft accommodation bore, and which faces the circumferential surface of said dragging shaft with a small gap formed therebetween so that the block can permit rotation of said dragging shaft while restricting deflection of the dragging shaft to an amount corresponding to the small gap.
