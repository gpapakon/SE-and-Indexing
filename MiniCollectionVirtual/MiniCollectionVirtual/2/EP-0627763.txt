<ABSTRACT>
A method for improved adhesion between dielectric material 
layers at their interface during the manufacture of a 

semiconductor device, comprising operations for forming a 
first layer (1) of a dielectric material on a circuit 

structure (7) defined on a substrate of a semiconductor 
material (6) and subsequently forming a second layer (3) of 

dielectric material overlying the first layer (1). Between 
the first dielectric material layer and the second, a thin 

oxide layer (2) is formed in contact therewith. This 
interposed oxide (2) serves an adhesion layer function 

between two superimposed layers (1,3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for manufacturing
monolithic integrated circuits which include overlaid
layers of dielectric materials, in particular layers of
silicon oxi-nitride and silicon nitride, as disclosed for example
in EP-A-327412.The adjacency of dielectric material layers having the same
or different compositions is a common occurrence in today's
technology at several manufacturing stages of integrated
circuits.In such processes, a second layer is subsequently formed
over a first layer of dielectric material. That second
layer may overlap the first at a next stage so as to
completely cover it, as is the case with certain
passivating steps, for example.However, before forming the second layer, operations are
often carried out such as the formation of a sacrificial
layer which is then etched away, either fully or partially,
or such as the partial removal of the first layer itself
without using a sacrificial layer. Anyway, the second
dielectric layer will have surface portions in direct
contact with the first.Dielectric material layers usually function to provide
electric insulation between conductive layers and to
protect underlying structures of the integrated circuit
against contaminants (impurities, moisture) or shocks.
Additionally, the provision of successive layers ensures
protection for the device even when any one of the layers
becomes damaged with the formation, for example, of
crossline cracks. Therefore it's important that no regions
be allowed to have less than perfect adhesion of the
overlaid layers in the areas of contact. Nonetheless, some 
of these materials develop peculiar adhesion problems at
the interface which are not fully understood by the skilled
ones in the art.These problems already exist on account of certain inherent
properties of the materials. In fact, when these are placed
in layer form over another material, they develop by
inherent stresses a more or less marked tendency to deform
the underlying structure into a more or less curved shape
which shows up as a sagging or hogging thereof, according
to whether the stress is a tensile or a compressive one.
Where the adjacent underlying structure is also formed of
another layer of dielectric material, the magnitude of the
force acting on the two layers may, even when the stress is
of the same type and perhaps of equal value, be different
due to fact that the thickness dimensions are generally
different. At high values of that stress, the layers tend
to separate and possibly "delaminate". In general,
delamination
