<ABSTRACT>
Reinforced elastomeric articles, such as tires, 
wherein the reinforcement is reticulated bacterial 

cellulose are provided. Reticulated bacterial 
cellulose has an average diameter of about 0.1 micron 

and a substantially infinite aspect ratio. The 
reinforced article comprises about 2 phr to 10 phr of 

the cellulose reinforcement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to reinforced elastomeric
articles, especially tires, wherein the reinforcement
comprises reticulated bacterial cellulose.It is well known in the art that fiber reinforced
elastomer composites have a higher modulus and better cut
and tear growth properties than the corresponding
reinforcement free elastomer. Although a higher
modulus and better cut and tear growth properties are
desirable properties, a short fiber reinforced
elastomer often has reduced tensile properties and
reduced elongation properties. It is often the case
that the amount of fiber loading in a reinforced
elastomer is a trade off between the modulus, cut
growth and tear growth properties desired, and the
reduction in tensile properties and elongation that can
be tolerated.Tires having members reinforced with short fibers
and unregenerated cellulose fibers are known from US-A- 3
802 478.The use of microbial cellulose to make composites is
known from WO-A- 8 911 783.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an elastomeric article that has improved modulus, tear
growth and cut growth properties while having
substantially undiminished tensile and elongation
properties.The invention provides a reinforced elastomeric
article, a pneumatic tire containing a fiber reinforced
elastomer component and a method of reinforcing an
elatomeric article, such as recited in the appended
claims. Fig. 1 illustrates reticulated bacterial
cellulose fiber.Fig. 2 illustrates a cellulose fiber reinforced
pneumatic tire.Fig. 2a illustrates cellulose fibers dispersed in
an SBR elastomer matrix.Fig. 3 illustrates the storage modulus of the
reinforced composite of the invention as compared with
unreinforced elastomer and a prior art composite.Fig. 4 illustrates the tan delta for the same
composites compared in Fig. 3.For good short fiber reinforcement of elastomers,
two important criteria are good adhesion between the
fiber and the elastomer and a high fiber aspect ratio.
To achieve a high aspect ratio, one can either
increase the length of the fiber or reduce the
diameter of the fiber. It is well known in the art that cellulose fibers
exhibit excellent adhesion to elastomers.With reference now to Fig. 1, an illustrated
reticulated bacterial cellulose fiber is produced by
Acetobacter bacteria in an aerated, agitated culture.
Such a fiber known by the trade name CellulonÂ® is
available from Weyerhauser. The illustrated fiber has
an average diameter of about 0.1 micron, and the fiber
is interconnected and networked such that the aspect
