<ABSTRACT>
The installation (plant) comprises an insulated storage tank (1) containing gas in at least partially liquid form at high pressure, a line (2) comprising a vaporiser (3) for supplying gas to a user station (A), a first circuit (4) for keeping it cold, comprising a valve (5), and a first exchanger (6) in a heat-exchange relationship with the fluid in the first tank (1), and a line (8) for maintaining pressure comprising a second exchanger (9) and a valve (10). Application especially as a back-up (emergency) installation for a main gas-production source (30).

Installation for supplying a gas at high pressure (P
u
) to 
at least one user station (A), comprising a first insulated 

reservoir (1) for storing gas in at least partially liquid 
form, having an upper part and a lower part, and at least one 

supply line (2) comprising an evaporator (3) and extending 
between the lower part of the reservoir (1) and the user 

station (A), characterized in that it comprises in addition a 
first fluid circuit (4) leaving the lower part of the 

reservoir (1), comprising, in series, a pressure control valve 
(5) and a first exchanger (6) in a heat exchange relationship 

with the fluid in the first reservoir, and ensuring that the 
first reservoir is kept cold. 
Installation according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises additionally a second fluid circuit (8) extending to 

the outside of the reservoir (1) between the lower and upper 
parts of the latter, comprising, in series, a second exchanger 

(9) and a second pressure control valve (10), and ensuring 
that the fluid in the first reservoir (1) is maintained at a 

storage pressure (P
s
) substantially equal to the supply 
pressure (P
u
). 
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the storage pressure (P
s
) in the 
reservoir (1) is higher than the critical pressure of the gas. 
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the gas is nitrogen. 
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the gas is oxygen. 
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
associated with a source (30) producing the said gas by  

 
separation from a gaseous mixture containing the said gas, 

comprising at least one conduit (34) supplying the said gas at 
the said high pressure (P
u
) communicating with the supply line 
(2) of the installation.
