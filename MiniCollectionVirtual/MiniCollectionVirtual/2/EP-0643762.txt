<ABSTRACT>
A high quality lubricant for hermetically sealed domestic air conditioner and refrigerator compressors, especially those using chlorine free hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant working fluids, is provided by mixed esters of hindered polyols, most desirably pentaerythritol, with a mixture of carboxylic acids including at least some isopentanoic acid along with either or both of iso-nonanoic acid and dibasic acids such as adipic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending
International Application No. PCT/US92/04438 designating
the United States and filed June 3, 1992, the entire
disclosure of which, except to the extent contrary to any
explicit statement herein, is hereby incorporated herein
by reference.This invention relates to lubricant base stocks,
which can also serve as complete lubricants in some cases;
compounded lubricants, which include at least one additive
for such purposes as improving high pressure resistance,
corrosion inhibition, and the like along with the lubricant
base stocks which contribute the primary lubricity to
the compounded lubricants; refrigerant working fluids including
lubricants according to the invention along with
primary heat transfer fluids, and methods for using these
materials. The lubricants and lubricant base stocks are
generally suitable for use with most or all halocarbon
refrigerants and are particularly suitable for use with
substantially chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing organic
refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as pentafluoroethane,
1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluroethane,
and tetrafluoroethanes, most particularly 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
The lubricants and base stocks, in combination
with these heat transfer fluids, are particularly
suitable for hermetically sealed compressors for domestic
air conditioners and refrigerators, where long lubricant
service lifetimes are important because of the difficulty
and expense of supplying additional lubricant after the
initial assembly of the compressor.Chlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for
use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the
atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the
currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat
transfer fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane.
The widespread commercial use of
chlorine-free refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been
hindered, however, by the lack of commercially adequate
lubricants. This is particularly true for one of the most
desirable working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, commonly
known in the art as "Refrigerant 134a" or simply
"R134a". Other fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desirable
working fluids.Esters of hindered polyols, which are defined for
this purpose as organic molecules containing at least five
carbon atoms, at least 2 -OH groups, and no hydrogen atoms
on any carbon atom directly attached to a carbon atom bearing
an -OH group, have already been recognized in the art
as high
