<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a novel method of
preparing a multiphase composition for use in
dermatology and cosmetics. In particular, the present
invention relates to a method of preparing a complex
emulsion comprising a continuous phase of a silicone
fluid and independent dispersed phases comprising a
gel phase, a secondary water phase, both of which
aqueous phases can release bioavailable water-soluble
ingredients, a perfluoropolyether phase, and an oil or
liquid crystal phase that can carry and release
bioavailable lipid-soluble ingredients.Conventional cosmetic vehicles for skin
moisturization deliver moisture to the skin only on
the initial application of the cosmetic moisturizer.
The need for a cosmetic, dermatologic or medicinal
multiphasic vehicle that will, in addition, provide
sustained skin moisturization while blocking skin
moisture loss has been long felt. There has also been
a need for a multiphasic vehicle that can be used to
provide water- soluble and lipid-soluble active
ingredients, such as vitamins, plant extracts,
antioxidants, proteins, polymers, oils and the like.
Most cosmetic vehicles consist of emulsions.An emulsion is known to be a dispersed
system comprising at least two immiscible liquid
phases (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th 
Edition, 1990). The emulsion's immiscible liquid
phase is composed of droplets between 0.005 to 2000
microns in diameter although the range of droplet
diameters may be narrower (e.g., between 0.1 to 100
microns). Emulsions are known to be thermodynamically
unstable. It is believed that the free energy
associated with high surface area of small droplets is
reduced when these droplets coalesce into large
droplets of less surface area. To minimize droplet
coalescence, it is known that an emulsifying agent can
be added to form a thin film about each droplet of
immiscible liquid in the emulsion (Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, 298-309, 1990).Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) such as
perfluoropolymethylisopropyl ether (Montefluos trade
name Fomblin HC) are useful as non-greasy lubricants.
These compounds are odorless, colorless, tasteless,
non-volatile, nontoxic, and chemically stable below
300°C. Consequently, PFPEs with a molecular weight
between 250 to about 30,000 have been used in a wide
variety of cosmetic formulations for make-up, hair,
toiletry, skin and baby products (Brunetta F., et.
al., Cosmet. Toilet. Ital. Edition 2, March/April
1986; Brunetta F., etal., XIV Congreso I.F.S.C.C.
