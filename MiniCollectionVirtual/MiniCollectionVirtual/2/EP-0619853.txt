<ABSTRACT>
A device for sheeting deep trenches consists of vertical stays (1, 2) arranged in pairs at equal distances along the trench; spreader frames (6) slidingly arranged on the stays (1, 2) for keeping apart the stays (1, 2) of a pair of stays; and large surface sheeting plates (4) whose edges are slidable in guiding channels (3) of the stays (1 and 2). The stays (1 and 2) have two sidewalls (31) which form a box-shaped hollow section together with an outer wall (30) and an inner wall (34). In order to reliably guide and transmit forces between the stays and the spreader frame, and to ensure a high load-bearing capacity with a reduced material consumption, the sidewalls (31) of the stays (1, 2) extend inwards over the inner wall (34) and bearing flanges (32) which form guiding channels (3) are arranged at their projecting ends (31'). Between the projecting parts (31') of the sidewalls (31) is shaped a vertical guiding channel (18) which form-fittingly encloses a rail (40) located on both front sides of the spreader frame (6). Rolls (12) mounted on the spreader frame (6) on both sides of said rail (40) roll on the outer sides of the supporting bearing flange (32).

A device for lining deep trenches, comprising

vertical supports (1, 2) for equidistant arrangement
in pairs opposite each other along the trench,
rigid bracing frames (6) which hold the supports (1,
2) of a support pair in spaced arrangement and are guided

form-fittingly and vertically displaceably on the supports
(1, 2) and
large outer lining plates (4) and inner lining plates
(5), the vertical edges of which are vertically displaceable

in guide channels (3) in the supports (1 and 2),

the supports (1 and 2) comprising two side walls (31) spaced
from each other which, together with an outer wall (30) and

an inner wall (34), form an at least partially closed hollow
box profile and the guide channels (3) being formed at least

partially of the outsides of the side walls (31), of guide
flang
es (35) located in the plane of the outer wall (30) and
of supporting flanges (32) arranged at a distance therefrom,

characterised in that the side walls (31) of the supports (1,
2) extend inwards beyond the inner wall (34), the supporting

flanges (32) being arranged at the projecting ends (31')
thereof, and in that a vertical guide channel (18) is

arranged between the supporting flanges (32) and the
projecting portions (31') of the side walls (31), which guide

channel (18) form-fittingly encloses a vertical rail (40)
located at both ends of the bracing frame (6), rollers (12)

rotatable about horizontal axles (11) being mounted on the
bracing frame (6) on both sides of this rail (40) and rolling

on the outsides of the supporting flanges (32).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
free ends of the supporting flanges (32) are bent to form 

side flanges (33) and in that horizontal axles (37), on which
the lining plates (4, 5) are supported, are so attached in

the projecting portions (31') of the side walls (31) and on
the side flanges (33) that axle stubs (39) project into the

space between the two side walls (31) and form the inner
guide of the guide channel (18).
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that
rollers (38) are mounted rotatably on the axles (37).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that horizontal reinforcing walls (24, 25)

are welded between the outsides of the side walls (31) of the
supports (1, 2) and the insides of the side flanges (33).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the guide channel (18) is arranged only

in the upper part of the support (1, 2), which extends over
from 4/6 to 5/6 of the overall height, while in the lower

part of the support (1, 2), which extends over from 2/6 to
1/6 of the overall height, there is arranged in the plane of

the supporting flanges (32) the inner wall (26) sealing on
the inside the space between the side walls (31).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the rigid bracing frame (6, 6', 6") is

composed of an upper cross-brace (7) and a lower cross-brace
(8), a right-hand vertical brace (9) and a left-hand vertical

brace (10), the two cross-braces (7, 8) being provided at
their ends with screw-down plates (15) positioned at right

angles to the longitudinal axis of the cross-braces (7, 8),
said screw-down plates (15) being screwed to screw-down

plates (16) arranged at the upper and lower ends of the
vertical braces (9, 10) in parallel with the longitudinal

axis thereof. 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the
axles (11) are arranged with the rollers (12) on the vertical

braces (9, 10) at the level of the cross-braces (7, 8).
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the
cross-braces (7, 8) are length-adjustable struts.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the rollers (12) are covered at top and

bottom by protective plates (41) which prevent contamination
of the rollers and strip off dirt or earth which is stuck to

the rollers (12).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the supports (1, 2) are provided at

their upper ends with a connecting flange (22) for screwing
down a connecting support and in that the connecting flange

(22) is provided with screw holes and a centring opening
(23), in which there engages a centring pin of the connecting

support.
