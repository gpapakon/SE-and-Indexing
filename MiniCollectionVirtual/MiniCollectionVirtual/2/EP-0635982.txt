<ABSTRACT>
The clock demodulator 25 continually demodulates the 

clock signal of the control CPU 7 transmitted from the clock 
modulator 10 of the center S. The terminal control CPU 23 

performs processes such as transmission and reception of data 
with the demodulated clock signal as a reference clock. The 

time required to synchronize the clocks of the CPUs 7 and 23 
is eliminated. Transmission and reception of data is 

executed quickly as soon as right of transmission is transferred 
to a terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission 
system wherein a center and a plurality of terminals are 
connected by a transmission line, the data transmission 
system being for performing bidirectionally transmission of 
data between the center and the terminals. As an example of this type of data transmission 
system, there has been known bidirectional cable television 
(CATV) system. In the bidirectional CATV system, the clock in a 
terminal must be synchronized with the clock in the center 
before data can be transmitted or received. In order to 
synchronize the clock in the terminal with the clock in the 
center, it can be proposed that the following operations be 
performed in each terminal. The right to transmit is transferred from one 
terminal to another. When a terminal receives from the 
center a signal requesting to connect circuits (polling 
signal), the terminal extracts the component of the connection 
request that corresponds to the clock of the center. 
The terminal demodulates the clock component into a reference 
clock signal that is synchronized with the clock of the 
center. Transmission of data to and reception of data from 
the center is then performed based on the reference clock. However, in this type of data transmission system,  
 
transmission and reception of data can not be executed during 
the preamble, that is, from when a terminal receives a 
connection request until the clock component is demodulated 
into reference clock. This will increase the time required 
for transmission and reception of data. When the system 
includes a plurality of terminals, a preamble is required 
every time the right of transmission changes from terminal to 
terminal. Accordingly, in a data transmission system such as 
CATV system where there are a great many terminals, and where 
the center performs polling on each terminal in succession, 
the time consumed by these preambles will become an especially 
large problem, in some cases limiting the number of 
terminals that can be connected with one center. It is therefore an objective of the present invention 
to provide a data transmission system capable of eliminating 
the preamble and of executing transmission and reception of 
data quickly. According to one aspect, the present invention 
provides a data transmission system for 
bidirectionally transmitting data between a center and a 
plurality of terminals, the data transmission system comprising: 
a center and a plurality of terminals connected to the 
center by a transmission
