<ABSTRACT>
A plastics fascia (1) is fixed to and covers the 
outside of a sheet steel reinforcement (31) which occupies 

only part of the height of the fascia. A steel tube (37) 
is mounted above the reinforcement (31) on legs (38) and is 

connected to the upper portion (36) of the fascia (1) by 
cooperating pairs of connectors each consisting of a 

latching tongue (49) (fixed on the tube 37) and a 
latch-receiving formation (59 or 68) (on the inside of the 

fascia) so that movement of the upper fascia portion (36) 
is resisted in vertical and fore-and-aft directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bumper assembly for a vehicle as 
specified in the preamble of claim 1 and as disclosed, for example, in 
the document US-A-5 006 057. A bumper assembly is well-known in which an outer 
plastic fascia is fixed on an inner transverse 
reinforcement made of pressed steel sheet. The 
reinforcement extends transversely over substantially 
the whole of the width of the front or rear end of the 
vehicle body and its primary purpose is to withstand 
impacts. The fascia closely covers the reinforcement 
and its primary purpose is that of styling. In 
particular, it may be moulded so as to match the shape 
of the adjacent body panels, it may also be coloured to 
match the colour of the bodywork, and it may have 
end-portions which extend laterally beyond the 
reinforcement and which constitute wrap-arounds 
extending alongside the vehicle. There is an increasing demand for bumper assemblies 
of greater vertical extent, particularly on a vehicle 
having a higher body than conventional saloon cars, such 
as a multi-purpose leisure vehicle designed for on-road 
and off-road use. However, an increase in the height of 
the above-described bumper assembly brings a number of 
disadvantages. The reinforcement makes up a large 
proportion of the weight of the assembly. Therefore, as  
 
its size is increased it becomes excessively heavy, and 
the weight of the bumper assembly becomes significant 
relative to the weight of the vehicle body. 
Furthermore, the assembly becomes more expensive in 
terms of material costs and manufacturing costs. In 
particular, material has to be added to the 
reinforcement in order to stiffen it. The bumper 
assembly provides an obstruction restricting the space 
available for other equipment and, at the front, it 
prevents efficient cooling of the engine. What is desired is a bumper assembly which overcomes 
or at least mitigates these problems. In particular, it 
would be desirable to be able to provide a bumper 
assembly which is relatively inexpensive, relatively 
lightweight and relative unobstructive. The present invention provides a bumper assembly 
comprising an inner transverse reinforcement which is to 
be mounted on one end of a vehicle body, and an outer 
fascia fixed to and covering the outside of the 
reinforcement, wherein the reinforcement occupies only 
part of the height of the fascia so that the fascia has 
an upward extension beyond the reinforcement, the 
assembly including a supporting structure comprising an 
elongate transverse member,
