<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the manufacturing of a 
catheter with at least one high-pressure lumen and one low-pressure 

lumen. The method comprises the manufacturing of a 
thin tube-like element with a high-pressure resistant sheath 

defining the high-pressure lumen, the incorporation of the 
tube-like element in a thicker tube-like element whilst 

leaving a space for a longitudinal channel forming the low-pressure 
lumen and arranging connecting members at one end 

forming connections with the lumens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydro-thrombectomy catheter and a
method for
manufacturing such a catheter with at least
one high-pressure lumen wherein, although the cross-section
of this lumen is small, a considerable liquid
flow can be generated, and one low-pressure lumen at a
distal end connected with an opening in the catheter
through which blood clots can be removed, comprising the
arranging of connecting members at one end forming
connections with the lumens.Such a catheter is for example known from EP-A-0
442 579 from the applicant. The hydro-thrombectomy
catheter described therein comprises a high-pressure
lumen which bends back at the distal end and ends in a
nozzle which is directed along an opening in the low-pressure
lumen. By supplying a liquid under high pressure
through the high-pressure lumen close to the opening in
the low-pressure lumen, a suction is created by ejector
action with which for example thrombi can be removed.
This known hydro-thrombectomy catheter is made from a
single tube comprising both the low pressure lumen and
the high pressure lumen.The invention is distinguished by
a thin tube-like element with a high-pressure
resistant sheath defining the high-pressure
lumen, the incorporation of the thin tube-like element in
a thicker tube-like element whilst leaving space for a 
longitudinal channel to form the low-pressure lumen, said
thin tube-like element extending over substantially the
same length of the catheter as the thicker tube-like
element and the method of manufacturing the catheter. By using a
separate, thin tube-like element with
a high-pressure resistant sheath which defines the high-pressure
lumen only, the catheter can withstand very high
pressures in the high-pressure lumen and suction
efficiency thereof can safely be enhanced. The thicker
tube-like element in which the thin tube-like element has
been incorporated can be manufactured of a different
material, for instance a far less pressure-resistant and
more pliable material. The manufactured catheter will
display the required flexibility, notwithstanding the
rigidity corresponding to high pressure resistance for
the high-pressure lumen. The influence of more rigid,
highly pressure-resistant material for the high-pressure
lumen only is considerably lower than if both lumens were
to be manufactured from such material. Moreover, said
influence can reliably and favourably be compensated by
the choice for a material for the low-pressure lumen with
a higher flexibility corresponding with the lower
pressure resistance
