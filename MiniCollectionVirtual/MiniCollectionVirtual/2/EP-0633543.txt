<ABSTRACT>
An internal drum printing plate plotter and method for 
using same is disclosed. The plotter provides a smooth path for 

a printing plate from an input location to a plotting location 
to an output location. The plotter includes a partially 

cylindrical drum and a loading tray associated with the drum at 
one end thereof. The drum covers at least 180 degrees of 

curvature and has an internal surface and the loading tray and 
the internal surface define the smooth path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plotting directly onto 
press plates generally and to doing so on an internal drum type 
plotter in particular. In the printing world, artwork is typically first 
plotted onto a film in an imagesetter or plotter. There are many 
types of imagesetters, three of the common ones are flat bed, 
external drum and internal drum imagesetters. A flat bed 
imagesetter scans film which has been placed onto a flat surface. 
External and internal drum imagesetters scan film which has been 
placed on the external and internal surface, respectively, of a 
cylindrical drum. After plotting in an imagesetter, the artwork is 
transferred to a printing plate typically via a contact process. 
The printing plate is later to be placed on a printing press 
which prints the artwork onto pieces of paper or other permanent 
medium. The contact process typically involves illuminating the 
printing plate, on which is placed the film, with a light bulb. 
New types of printing plates, such as the N90 manufactured by 
Hoechst AG of Germany, have recently been developed. These 
printing plates are typically formed of a metal or polyester 
sheet onto which is placed a light sensitive emulsion which is 
sensitive to scanned laser light. The artwork can be directly 
scanned onto these new printing plates, thereby potentially 
eliminating the need for the step of plotting on film. However, the plotters which plot the artwork onto films 
cannot directly be utilized for plotting on the new printing 
plates for two main reasons: 1) the printing plates are less 
sensitive to laser light than film is and 2) the metal printing 
plates are not as flexible as the film.  The issue of sensitivity to laser light is typically 
solved by utilizing a stronger laser source. This entails also 
changing the associated optics to those which perform the same 
function but on the stronger laser beam. The issue of rigidity is more difficult to solve. For 
a flat bed plotter, such as the Raystar CTP manufactured by 
Scitex Corporation Ltd. the assignees of the present invention, 
there is no problem since the printing plate is laid flat. 
However, flat bed plotters, for both films and printing plates, 
utilize a tremendous amount of floor space. External and 
internal drum plotters utilize less floor space and internal drum 
plotters provide the fastest scanning speed. Thus, an internal 
drum printing plate plotter has many advantages. Reference is now made to Fig. 1 which illustrates a 
cross-section of a typical internal drum
