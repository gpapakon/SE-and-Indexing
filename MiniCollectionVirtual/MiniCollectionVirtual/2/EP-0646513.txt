<ABSTRACT>
A remote operation mechanism for a stroller is 
described including a frame (3), an opening/closing 

operation lever (4), a pulley (5) rotatable so as to 
be interlocked with an ascending/descending operation 

of the operation lever (4), a lock plate (6), an 
ascension regulating plate (66), a reset spring (67), 

a stopper formed on the lock plate (6) and an 
operating projection (53) formed on the pulley (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operation 
mechanism for opening and closing various types of 
lock mechanisms arranged on a stroller. More 
particularly, the present invention is directed to a 
mechanism for remotely operating a lock mechanism on 
a stroller by an operation mechanism arranged in a 
handle pole of the stroller. A folding arrangement of a stroller and an 
arrangement allowing a handle pole erecting position 
to be selected either at the back of a baby seat or at 
the front thereof are known in the art. Further, a mechanism for remotely controlling the 
opening and closing of a folding system locking 
mechanism and a handle pole erecting position locking 
mechanism by using an operation mechanism arranged in 
the middle of the handle pole is disclosed in, e.g., 
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 62-474. Such remote operation mechanisms may cause 
accidents if erroneously operated on occasions other 
than required. Therefore, a remote operation 
mechanism is usually provided with a fail-safe system.  
 However, conventional fail-safe systems are 
operated and released manually with no mechanism for 
automatically resetting the fail-safe system to its 
original position. As a result, if the fail-safe 
system is not manually reset after the fail-safe 
system has been released and the lock mechanism 
arranged in the stroller has then been opened or 
closed, then the same danger of erroneous operation as 
in the case where no fail-safe mechanism is provided 
is likely to arise. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a solution to the above problem. The present 
invention provides a remote operation mechanism for a 
stroller, in which a fail-safe mechanism is reset to 
its initial position so as to be interlocked with 
every single remote operation without fail and thereby 
be able to automatically lock an operation system. The device according to the invention is applied 
to a remote operation mechanism for a stroller, which 
includes: a frame having a U-shaped section and an 
appropriate length; and opening/closing operation 
lever, a base end portion thereof being pivotally 
supported by the frame, the other end portion thereof 
being capable of ascending and descending along the 
frame; a pulley rotating so as to be interlocked with  
 
the ascending and descending operation of the 
opening/closing operation lever; and a lock plate 
sliding along an upper surface of the frame, a lower 
end portion of an ascension regulating plate formed on 
a side wall of the

<CLAIMS>
A remote operation mechanism for a stroller 
comprising: 


a frame; 
an opening/closing operation lever, a base end 
portion thereof being pivotally supported by said 

frame, and an other end portion thereof being operable 
for ascending and descending along said frame; 
a pulley which is rotatable so as to be 
interlocked with the ascending and descending 

operation of said opening/closing operation lever; and 
a lock plate mounted so as to be slidable along 
an upper surface of said frame; 
an ascension regulating plate, a lower end 
portion thereof formed on a side wall of said lock 

plate at an operating position of the lock plate being 
located atop a drive arm plate formed at the other end 

of said opening/closing operation lever; 
a reset spring stretched between a base end 
portion of said lock plate and said frame; 
a stopper formed on a lower surface of the base 
end portion of said lock plate, said stopper being 

selectively engaged with engaging grooves formed at an 
upper end of said frame; and  

 
an operating projection formed on said pulley, 
said operating projection abutting against the back of 

said lock plate. 
The remote operation mechanism for a 
stroller according to claim 1, wherein said 

opening/closing operation lever receives a force for 
being reset to an original position by said reset 

spring interposed between said opening/closing 
operation lever and said joint member. 
The remote operation mechanism for a 
stroller according to claim 1 or to claim 2, wherein there are two 

opening/closing operation levers, and wherein 
operation of the two opening/closing operation levers 

is regulated by said ascension regulating plate.
