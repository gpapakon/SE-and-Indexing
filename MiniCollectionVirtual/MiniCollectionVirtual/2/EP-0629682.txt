<ABSTRACT>
Process for upgrading a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
substantially boiling in the gasoline range which comprises: 


a) subjecting the feedstock to a separation treatment and 
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C₆ 

and smaller hydrocarbons and a second hydrocarbon feed stream 
comprising C₆ and greater hydrocarbons; 
b) subjecting at least part of the second hydrocarbon feed stream 
to a separation treatment wherein normal paraffins and optionally 

mono-isoparaffins are separated from di-isoparaffins; 
c) recovering therefrom a first separation effluent stream 
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins and a 

second separation effluent stream comprising di-isoparaffins; 
d) subjecting at least part of the first separation effluent 
stream to a reforming step to produce a reformate; 
e) subjecting at least part of the reformate to a separation 
treatment and recovering therefrom a light fraction comprising C₆ 

and smaller hydrocarbons and a heavy fraction comprising C₆ and 
greater hydrocarbons; and 
f) subjecting at least part of the light fraction and the first 
hydrocarbon feed stream to an isomerisation step and recovering 

therefrom an isomerate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for upgrading a
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the gasoline
range to produce a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced octane
content and a reduced aromatics content.One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to
produce gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands
on product quality and having a high octane number.EP-A-553 931 describes one such process already proposed for obtaining an octane-enhanced gasoline.This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now
to be established without lead-containing additives, less
aromatics, in particular benzene, less olefins and lower gasoline
vapour pressure.Object of the present invention is to provide a process for
the preparation of gasolines fulfilling both the increasing
environmental demands on product quality and the high octane
requirement.It has now been found that gasolines can be produced having a
high octane number and a reduced aromatics content, in particular
benzene, when use is made of an upgrading process comprising a
specific sequence of process steps.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for producing a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced octane content and a reduced aromatics content, which process comprises:
a) subjecting
a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in
the gasoline range to a separation treatment and
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C6
and smaller hydrocarbons and a second hydrocarbon feed stream
comprising C6 and greater hydrocarbons;b) subjecting at least part of the second hydrocarbon feed stream
to a separation treatment wherein normal paraffins and optionally
mono-isoparaffins are separated from di-isoparaffins;c) recovering therefrom a first separation effluent stream
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins and a
second separation effluent stream comprising di-isoparaffins, which
second separation effluent stream is passed directly to a
gasoline blending pool; d) subjecting at least part of the first separation effluent
stream to a reforming step to produce a reformate;e) subjecting at least part of the reformate to a separation
treatment and recovering therefrom a light fraction comprising C6
and smaller hydrocarbons and a heavy fraction comprising C6 and
greater hydrocarbons; andf) subjecting at least part of the light fraction and the first
hydrocarbon feed stream to an isomerisation step and recovering
therefrom an isomerate.In this
