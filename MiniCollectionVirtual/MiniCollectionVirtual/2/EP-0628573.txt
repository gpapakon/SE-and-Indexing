<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a solubilized protein 
is disclosed, which is obtained by reducing disulfide bonds 

in a disulfide bond-containing water-insoluble protein 
material into mercapto groups and subsequently converting a 

part or an entire portion thereof into carboxymethyldisulfide 
groups. In particular, the disclosed process for the 

production of a solubilized protein which comprises (a) 
treating a disulfide bond-containing water-insoluble protein 

material with an aqueous alkaline solution of a reducing 
agent, and (b) reacting the protein treated by step (a) with 

thioglycolic acid in the presence of an oxidizing agent under 
a weakly acidic to a weakly alkaline condition. A process 

for the production of regenerated protein products, which 
comprises regenerating disulfide bonds in the solubilized 

protein, is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for solubilizing 
water-insoluble and disulfide bond-containing proteins 
derived from wool and other like animal hair, human hair, and 
other like protein-containing materials. In addition, it 
relates to a novel process for regenerating solubilized 
protein for use in regenerated protein products, such as 
regenerated protein films and regenerated protein fibers. As it is well known, keratin fibers, such as those 
found in wool, feel rich due to their excellent hygroscopic 
and moisture releasing properties, which respond to the 
moisture content of the air. Such properties are 
characteristic of a complex composed of a fibrous keratin 
with Î±-helix structure, which is the crystalline moiety of 
the fiber, and an amorphous matrix protein, the molecules of 
which are cross-linked with each other through disulfide 
bonds (-SS-). Attempts have been made to solubilize keratin fibers 
having these excellent physical properties in order to 
recycle them. For example, a process is known in which an 
aqueous solution of sodium thioglycolate is treated with an 
oxidizing agent in order to improve the reducing power of 
thioglycolic acid. The resulting partially oxidized aqueous  
 
solution of sodium thioglycolate, which is partially 
converted into sodium thiodiglycolate, is then applied to 
feathers to produce an aqueous solution of keratin having 
high viscosity and high molecular weight (JP-A-53-119900; the 
term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published 
Japanese patent application"). A process is also known in 
which wool is solubilized by treating it with 100 % 
thioglycolic acid under heating (JP-A-4-91138). Another 
process is known in which a keratin membrane is toughened and 
softened by addition of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol (JP-B-55-33826; 
the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined 
Japanese patent publication"). Finally, a process is known 
in which wool is treated with a reducing agent, the resulting 
mercapto group-containing protein is dissolved in a neutral 
buffer solution, and a protein film for use as a cell culture 
bed is formed from the solution by forming disulfide bonds or 
cross-linking bonds with UV irradiation (JP-A-60-160883). However, all of these conventional processes are 
disadvantaged as the protein solubilization methods used 
convert disulfide bonds into mercapto groups by means of 
reduction. Protein fibers, such as those wool, have a low 
solubilization ratio because of their high disulfide bond 
crosslinking
