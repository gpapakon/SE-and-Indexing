<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sprout inhibitor for potatoes which, as the main component, contains rape oil methylester and/or specific long-chain alcohols, eventually in mixture with the medium- and/or long-chain alcohols known for said purpose, and/or ethereal oil and/or the known chemical sprout-inhibiting agents, or to the use of rape oil methylester alone or the use of C18 to

 C36-alcohols such as Espum EGA 162 (now Dehysan) alone, or in a mixture with rape oil methylester and/or other known sprout-inhibiting agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sprout inhibitor for potatoes, which substantially
consists of rape oil methylester in mixture with medium and/or long-chain alcohols.The potatoes harvested in the fall are frequently expected
to be stored through the winter and far into the coming
spring at least until early potatoes are available again.Even with cool storage of potatoes, as it is usually done
in the potato-processing industry, the potatoes start to sprout
after a few weeks even when stored at 6 to 8Â°C, and they are
considerably sprouted after three to four months.The use of sprout-inhibiting agents is known since a
long time. Very old sprout inhibitors are certain ethereal oils, 
in particular of the peppermints, and also of the "muna"
plant, which is related to the peppermints. Peppermint oils
and "muna" oils are, of course, relatively expensive, so that
any industrial application only on the basis of said ethereal
oils is hardly feasible.The chemical agents used recently for sprout inhibition
in connection with potatoes include propham, i.e. isopropylphenyl
carbamate, also in combination with chloropropham;
however, the compound has a herbicidal effect, so that its use
is not absolutely safe.Also known are medium-chain and higher-chain alcohols, in
particular C17-C24-alcohols, which are collected in industry,
whereby said alcohols are frequently coined with propham and/or
chloropropham.As state of the art, reference is made to, for example the
DD-patents 209 378, 205 600, 147 039, 146 237 and 138 731, as
well as to WO/PCT 93/00008, which show the use of long-chain
alcohols, if necessary in combination with propham and/or chloropropham,
whereby DD-PS 209 378 also shows medium-chain alcohols
of C8-C14; DD-PS 205 600 shows the addition of m-chloro-naphthalene,
and DD-PS 138 731 shows a combination of higher
alcohols with the main components nonanol and decanol, and 
WO 93/00008 shows aromatic aldehydes or alcohols or thymol
or mixtures thereof. EP 0 287 946 A2 describes the use of
an ethereal oil from a mentha type, in particular oils of
Mentha piperita L, as well as again peppermint oil and oils
of different types of mint.The drawback of all of said sprout inhibitors is that they
supply only rather moderate results in spite of the use of
relatively large amounts, and that with the exception of the
ethereal oils, their utilization for the preservation of foods
is actually undesirable because they are not derived from
natural products.As mentioned above, the exclusive use of ethereal oils
is prohibitive for
