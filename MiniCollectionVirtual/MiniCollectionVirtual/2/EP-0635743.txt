<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a binocular optical device, of the goggles type, with increased resolution and/or field of view. This device is particularly applicable in the construction of night-vision goggles, making it possible to superimpose on the visible image an intensified infrared image, it being possible for such goggles to be worn, for example, by an aeroplane or helicopter pilot and enable him to observe the landscape in daytime as at night.   The device includes, for each of the pilot's eyes, an objective (OIL) having a given optical axis (Y11, Y12) and receiving the infrared light. The optical axes of the two objectives make an angle such that, when observing a landscape at infinity, the two fields of view intersect.
