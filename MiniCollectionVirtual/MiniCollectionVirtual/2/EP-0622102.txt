<ABSTRACT>
A filter is formed from porous metal filter media which is 
cut into strips (10) and then connected edge-to-edge by 

welding to form a corrugated sheet with the welds (19) 
forming ridges on alternately opposite sides of the 

sheet. This has significant benefits over corrugating the 
sheet by bending including an absence of cracking and so a 

significantly better filter performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to filters and filter manufacture 
and particularly to metal filters and their manufacture. Metal filters are used in hostile environments where 
filters of, for example, plastics materials are not 
satisfactory. It has been proposed to form such filters 
from a sheet of porous stainless steel pleated into 
corrugations. The corrugated sheet may be formed into a 
cylinder. It has been found that some stainless steel media are 
prone to damage when subject to the pleating necessary to 
form the corrugations. This is particularly the case 
where the medium is a thick composite of more than one 
layer. The media can crack along the stressed ridges of 
the corrugations and sometimes delamination occurs. Such damage and inherent weakness can be exaggerated when 
the media is subject to reverse flows, flows near sonic 
velocity and high differential pressures. Any one of 
these can stress the weakened ridges to the point of 
collapse. This can cause the corrugations to vibrate, 
bend or close-up, blocking the flow path through the 
media.  According to a first aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a filter comprising V-shaped corrugations having 
a plurality of ridges on alternately opposite sides of the 
filter, each wall of each corrugation being formed by a 
porous metal strip having spaced side edges and each ridge 
being formed by a welded connection between two side edges 
of adjacent strips. By welding together sheets to form the ridges, the ridges 
are unstressed. The weld supports and strengthens the 
ridge and cracking and damage are mitigated. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a method of manufacturing a filter comprising 
forming a plurality of porous metal strips with each strip 
having spaced side edges and then connecting the strips to 
form a corrugated filter having a plurality of ridges on 
alternately opposite sides of the filter, the corrugations 
being V-shaped and each ridge being formed by a welded 
connection between two sides edges of two adjacent 
strips. The following is a more detailed description of the 
embodiment of the invention, by way of example, reference 
being made to the accompanying drawings in which:-  Figure 1 is a schematic elevational view of a welding jig 
showing two porous metal strips arranged in a 
V-configuration and welded together along respective side 
edges, and Figure 2 is a view of the jig similar to the view of 
Figure 1 showing the connection of further porous sheets 
to form a succession of

<CLAIMS>
A filter of the kind comprising V-shaped corrugations 
having a plurality of ridges on alternately opposite sides 

of the filter, characterised in that each wall of each 
corrugation is formed by a porous metal strip (10) having 

spaced side edges (11) and each ridge is formed by a 
welded connection (19) between two side edges (11) of 

adjacent strips (10). 
A filter according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the side edges (11) of each strip (10) are parallel and 

the spacing between said side edges (11) is the same in 
each strip (10). 
A filter according to claim 1 or claim 2 and in the 

form of a cylinder so that the ridges lie alternately on 
one of two imaginary concentric circles. 
A filter according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the porous metal strip (10) 

comprises two layers of porous metal media, the first 
layer being of stainless steel fibres in a uniform 

structure with the fibres sintered together at their 
points of contact and the second layer being a stainless 

steel woven wire mesh and a sintered metal particulate 
bonded in the openings in said mesh. 
A method of manufacturing a filter comprising forming 
a plurality of porous metal strips (10), each strip having 

spaced side edges (11), and then connecting the strips 
(10) to form a corrugated filter having a plurality of 

ridges on alternately opposite sides of the filter, the 
corrugations being V-shaped and each ridge being formed by 

a welded connection (19) between two side edges of two 
adjacent strips (10). 
A method according to claim 5 including arranging two 
strips (10) in a V-configuration with respective ones of 

said respective two side edges (11) in contact and then 
welding said contacting side edges (11) to form a ridge. 
A method according to claim 6 and further comprising 
arranging two pairs of V-configuration strips (10) to form 

a W-configuration with the other side edge (11) of one of 
the strips (10) of one of the V-configurations contacting 

the other side edge (11) of one of the strips (10) of the 
other V-configuration, said contacting sides (11) being 

welded together to form a ridge. 
A method according to claim 7 and comprising 
connecting together at least two of said W-configurations 

by contacting respective other side edges (11) of 
respective final strip (10) of the two W-configurations 

 
together and then welding said contacting edges (11) to 

form a ridge. 
A method according to claim 8 and further comprising 
bending said plurality of connected W-configurations into 

a tube so that the other edges (11) of the final strips 
(10) of the connected W-configurations contact one 

another, with a weld (19) being provided between said 
contacting edges to form a ridge.
