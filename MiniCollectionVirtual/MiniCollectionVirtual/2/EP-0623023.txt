<DESCRIPTION>
Retroreverse pyrrole-amidino oligopeptide anticancer agent analogues , preparation of same , and pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogues .Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to anticancer agents as per general formula ( I )(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof , where : n = 0 or a whole number from 1 to 6 A = a single chemical bond or an alicyclic or aromatic or heterocyclic residue,X^ = a chemical bond, the -NHCO- group or the -CONH- groupX2, X- (either equal or different) = the -CONH- or -NHCO- group and where: i) Rj_ and R2 (equal) = an oxiranomethyl or 1-aziridinomethyl or C2~C| alkyl group, substituted in position 2, if required, by a hydroxy or C2-Ci alcoxy halogen or -0S02R/j group, where:R{| is C-]_-C{| alkyl or phenyl or 

 ii) R^ = H, R2 as defined above or iii) R1 = H, R2 = -C0-(CH2)m-Rτ, where m is 0 or a whole number from 1 to 4 and R = halogen, oxiranyl or methyloxiranyl or azirinidyl, cyclopropyl or a Cp-Cg alkenyl group substituted, if required, by halogens or a ketone or an α.β unsaturated alicylic lactone. Considering that: if R, and R2 are as defined under i) and ii) and X^ is a single chemical bond, A is a single chemical bond and n = 0; if R-j^ and R2 are as defined under iii). X and A are single chemical bonds and n = 0; if Xi is a single chemical bond or the -CONH- group and n = 0, 2 = X = -CONH- is impossible.The invention further refers to the process for the preparation of the aforesaid products, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the pharmacetical compositions containing said products. State of the art Dystamicin is an antibiotic already known having formula (A)
 belonging to the pyrrole-amidino antibiotic group, endowed with 

interesting antiviral properties, e.g. against herpesviruses and Moloney sarcoma virus, and capable of interacting reversibly and selectively with dA and dT base-rich DNA sequences, thus interfering both in replication and transcription processes (cf. F. Arcamone, Molecular basis of specificity in nucleic acid-drug interaction, B. Pullman and J. Jorterez , eds. , 369-383 (1990), Kluwer Academic Publishers) .As known, the severe side effects that, at present, are caused by the intake of antiviral and anticancer agents limit their use in a large number of cases, which, instead, should benefit from the therapy. Moreover, the clinical treatment of serious solid tumours, e.g. of lungs and ovaries, must be developed, as none - for the time being - is adequate. A requisite for the therapeutic progress
