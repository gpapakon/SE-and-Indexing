Aerated and grainy confectionery product free
from cellulose compounds, containing a polyol selected

from the group comprising mannitol, erythritol and
mixtures thereof, characterized in that the said polyol

constitutes from 13.5% to 28.0% of the total sweetening
component of said product, on a dry basis.
Confectionery product according to claim 1,
characterized in that mannitol is used and constitutes

from 13.5 to 25%, preferably from 13.7 to 20% and more
preferably from 14 to 17% of the total sweetening

component of said product, on a dry basis.
Confectionery product according to claim 1 or
2, characterized in that erythritol is used and

constitutes from 14 to 27% and preferably from 16 to 25%
of the total sweetening component of said product, on a

dry basis.
Confectionery product according to one of
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the sweetening

component which it contains represents from 60 to 96%,
preferably from 70 to 90% and more preferably from 75 to

88% of the confectionery product, on a dry basis.
Confectionery product according to one of
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that its density relative

to water is between 0.4 and 1.3, preferably between 0.6
and 1.25 and more preferably between 0.8 and 1.20, and in

that it contains an overrun agent in the proportion of 0.2
to 15%. 
Confectionery product according to any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it contains a fat and

an emulsifier, in the proportion of 1 to 10% and 0.1 to
2%, respectively.

claims 1 to 6, characterized in that its water content is

between 3% and 15%, preferably between 4 and 10% and more
preferably between 5 and 8%.
Confectionery product according to any one of
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the sweetening

component consists, besides mannitol and/or erythritol, of
at least one product chosen from among polyol syrups and

oligosaccharide and polysaccharide syrups, combined where
appropriate with an intense sweetener, a viscosity

modifying agent or a water activity modifier.
Process for manufacturing a confectionery
product according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that:

cooking of at least 75% of the sweetening
component of the confectionery product comprising 13.5% to

28.0% with respect to the total sweetening component of
the confectionery product, on a dry basis, of mannitol

and/or erythritol in the solubilized state, is performed
at a temperature of between 110째C and 135째C,
a powder or a fondant comprising mannitol and/or
erythritol is added to the cooked mass in a proportion of

0.1 to 25%, 
working of the resulting mass is performed in
order to aerate it, before shaping it and wrapping the

confectionery product obtained.
Process for manufacturing a confectionery
product according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that :

on the one hand a mannitol and/or erythritol
powder of fine particle size, and on the other hand a

complementary sweetening component in the form of a

constituting from 13.5 to 28.0% of the total sweetening
component of the confectionery product, on a dry basis,

are mixed thoroughly in correct proportions and at a
temperature of between 45째C and 90째C,
working of the resulting mass is performed in
order to aerate it, before shaping it and wrapping the

confectionery product obtained.
