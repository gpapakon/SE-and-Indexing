<ABSTRACT>
An optical transmission system comprising a supervisory system of devices disposed along an optical link is disclosed. Counter-propagating Raman amplifiers are disposed along the optical link. Low-frequency supervisory signals are superimposed on the optical signals traveling on the optical link by suitable modulators in the devices disposed along the line. Counter-propagating Raman amplifiers amplify optical signals and do not introduce a substantial amount of attenuation on the low-frequency supervisory signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WITH RAMAN AMPLIFIERS COMPRISING A SUPERVISORY SYSTEMThe present invention relates an optical transmission system with Raman amplifiers comprising a supervisory system. The present invention also relates to an optical repeater.In an optical transmission system, especially in a submarine optical transmission system, there is the very felt need of supervising the operating state of devices disposed along the optical line, such as for example optical repeaters, branching units and so on. In the particular case of a submarine system, such supervising has to be performed remotely.In the present description and claims, the expression "supervisory signal" is used to indicate either command informations suitable to set predetermined system parameters (such as, for example, the gain and the output power of an optical amplifier), or query informations suitable to check the operating state of a device, or informations on the operating state of said device, or communications between the maintenance and/or supervisory personnel operating in intermediate points of the optical line or in terminal stations of the system.For example, the supervising of the operating state of an optical repeater typically comprises control functions, such as for example the regulation of the value of the current furnished to the pump lasers, or the switching between a working pump laser and a spare pump laser, and so on. Further, the supervising of the operating state of an optical repeater typically also comprises monitor functions, such as for example the monitoring of the operating temperature of the repeater, or the monitoring of the current furnished to the pump lasers, or the monitoring of the input power of the optical signal entering into the repeater and/or the monitoring of the output power of the optical signal exiting from the repeater, and so on.For the purpose of supervising, many kinds of supervisory systems in optical transmission systems have been proposed.For example, EP0504777 discloses a transmission system for transmitting over an optical link an auxiliary signal that is auxiliary relative to a traffic signal which is transmitted simultaneously over said link, the system including at least one 

equipment including optical amplification means. For the purpose of enabling said equipment to emit the auxiliary signal, the system includes means for modulating the gain of the optical amplification means of said equipment by said auxiliary signal. Optical amplification means disclosed in 777
