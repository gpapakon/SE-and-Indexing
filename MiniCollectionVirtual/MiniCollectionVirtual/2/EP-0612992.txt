<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic method of diagnosing a press (10, 150) for the 
presence of any abnormality that deteriorates a quality of a 

product manufactured by the press, wherein physical value 
(Fs, Fsi, Ff, Ffi, Fp, Fpi, Xsi, Xei, Xy, Xz, Vx,
 Gx, Gy, 
Gz, Temp A, Temp B, Va0, Vf0, Vd0, V, Aa, Ag, AZ, Afi, Ps, 

Pmai, Psa, Paa, Pyai, Peai, Pzai) such as a load generated 
at a selected portion of the press during operation of the 

press is detected, and the press is diagnosed for any 
abnormality, on the basis of the detected physical value, 

and according to a predetermined reference. For example, the 
diagnosis is effected based on: a waveform of a load 

detected in relation to a physical value which changes 
during a pressing cycle; a distribution of local values of 

the load detected local portions of the press; a correlation 
between the load and the physical value; a patter of 

variation of the load as the number of pressing cycles; a 
displacement amount, velocity or acceleration, or a 

temperature of a selected component of the press; or a 
capacity of a fluid used for a cylinder which produces a 

load or force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
pressing machine, and more particularly to a method of 
diagnosing a pressing machine for any abnormality on the 
machine, or to check the machine if it is in order for 
assuring a product with intended quality. There have been widely used pressing machines 
adapted to perform a pressing operation with relative 
movements of a pair of opposed dies. Figs. 1 and 2 show an 
example of a single-action press equipped with a cushioning 
device for even distribution of a blank holding force on a 
pressure ring 30, so that a blank placed on the pressure 
ring 30 is drawn by a cooperative pressing action of an 
upper die 18 and a lower die in the form of a punch 12, 
while the blank is held between the pressure ring 30 and the 
upper die 18. Commonly, the pressing condition of the 
machine is adjusted or optimized by a try-and-error 
procedure, by performing a test run of the press, for each 
specific die set, so that the product obtained by the 
pressing operation has a desired level of quality. The 
pressing condition includes, for example: pneumatic pressure  
 
Pa of a cushioning pneumatic cylinder 42, which influences 
the blank holding force applied to the pressure ring 30; 
relative distance or die height h (indicated in Fig. 2) 
between plungers 22 and a slide plate (main slide) 20, which 
affects a forming force for the pressing action on the 
blank; and hydraulic pressure Ps of a balancing hydraulic 
cylinders 32 for even or uniform distribution of the blank 
holding force on the pressure ring 30. If the intended 
quality of the product is not obtained on the press whose 
condition has been adjusted, the die set is adjusted, 
modified or rectified as needed. Generally, the pressing 
machine is inspected to check if its components satisfy the 
appropriate standards, for example, if the parallelism of 
the slide plate or main slide 20 and a cushion platen or pad 
28 is held within a predetermined range of tolerance. 
Satisfying these standards does not necessarily mean that the 
machine assures an intended level of quality of the product 
manufactured by the machine. However, possible causes for quality deterioration 
of the product manufactured by the press may include the 
other factors, for example, leakage of compressed air from 
the cushioning pneumatic cylinder 42, accumulation of an oil 
within the cylinder 42, and leakage of a pressurized fluid 
from the balancing hydraulic cylinders 32. These defects or 
abnormalities cannot be easily detected by

<CLAIMS>
A diagnostic method of diagnosing a press (10,150) 
for the presence of any abnormality that deteriorates a 

quality of a product manufactured by a pressing operation 
performed on a blank while a main slide of the press is 

reciprocated, wherein the presence or absence of an 
abnormality of the press is determined on the basis of a load 

detected at a selected portion of the press, characterized by 
comprising the steps of: 


detecting a load (Fs, Fsi, Ff, Ffi, Fp, Fpi) generated at 
a selected portion of the press (10,150) prior to a production 

run of the press, while said main slide (20,160,164) is moved 
without the blank; 
determining a selected characteristic of the load 
detected prior to the production run of the press; and 
determining the presence or absence of an abnormality, on 
the basis of the determined characteristic of the load, and 

according to a predetermined reference that permits the 
product to have an intended quality. 
A diagnostic method according to Claim 1, wherein 
said step of detecting a load comprises: 


removing from the press at least a lower die (12,152) 
which cooperates with an upper die (18,162) carried on said 

main slide to perform said pressing operation; and 
installing on the press a load measuring apparatus (100) 
having a measuring member (102,106) provided with load 

detecting means (114,116,118) for detecting a load acting on 
said measuring member, said measuring member being positioned 

so that the load can be detected by said load detecting means 
when said main slide is moved without said blank into contact 

with said measuring member. 
A diagnostic method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the press has a cushioning device having a cushion 

platen (28), a pressure ring (30) for holding said blank, a  
 

plurality of balancing hydraulic cylinders (32) disposed on 
the cushion platen, and a plurality of cushion pins (24) 

having lower ends associated with respective pistons of the 
balancing hydraulic cylinders and upper ends on which the 

pressure ring is placed, wherein said step of removing at 
least said lower die comprises removing at least the lower die 

and said pressure ring from the press, and said step of 
detecting a load further comprises a step of detecting the 

load which acts on said cushion pins when said cushion platen 
is moved by said main slide through said measuring member, 

cushion pins and balancing hydraulic cylinders. 
A diagnostic method according to any one of Claims 
1 - 3, wherein said selected characteristic of said load 

consists of a waveform of said load detected in relation to a 
physical value which changes during a pressing cycle performed 

on the press. 
A diagnostic method according to any one of Claims 
1 - 4, wherein said selected characteristic of said load 

consists of a distribution of local values of said load 
detected at selected local portions of said press which 

correspond to respective local portions of said main slide. 
A diagnostic method according to any one of Claims 
1 - 5, wherein said selected characteristic of said load 

consists of a correlation between said load and a physical 
value (Pa, Sd, h, ha, hb, Pe, Peai) which changes with said 

load. 
A diagnostic method according to any one of Claims 
1 - 6, wherein said selected characteristic of said load 

consists of a pattern in which said load varies as a function 
of the number of pressing cycles repeated on the press.
