<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is 
disclosed in which video signal and indexing signal are 

separately recorded in video signal areas and subcode 
areas, respectively, of diagonal tracks formed on a tape by 

a rotating head. The apparatus has a tape driver (7) for 
driving the tape, add/erase command keys (40, 41) for 

generating add/erase command to add/erase the indexing 
signal, an indexing signal control (13) for setting and 

resetting the indexing signal (SRID), and a recording 
device (22) for recording the video signal to the video 

signal area and, if any, the indexing signal to the subcode 
area of each track. An editing control (33) is provided 

for controlling the indexing signal control in response to 
the add/erase command such that the indexing signal is 

first recorded as a reset state for a first predetermined 
amount (Î”D3) and then recorded as a set state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus for recording a video signal together
with indexing information to tape, and for reproducing the
recorded information by means of rotating heads, and particularly
to a recording and reproducing apparatus for
recording editable indexing information.Video cassette recorders (VCR) and other recording
and reproducing apparatuses using a tape medium are
now widely and commonly available. Further reductions in
device size enabled by high density recording techniques
and digital technologies are also being developed. In
digital media such as these, a subcode is usually also
recorded when recording the data signal. This subcode is
an integral part of the complete data signal, and may be or
include an indexing ID showing the recording start position
of the data, an absolute time code showing the absolute
position of the data on tape, or a user-defined time code.
Examples of devices recording such a subcode include DAT
(Digital Audio Tape recorders) and 8mm VCRs. It is
commonly known that the DAT and 8mm VCR standards specify
an editable subcode that can be separately re-recorded
while preserving the recorded video signal and audio
signal. EP-A-0 524 007 representing the closest prior art from which the invention proceeds
discloses a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus which records video signals
divided in plural segments in every specific group, and index signals accompanying the
video signals in different areas on a magnetic tape having oblique tracks, records the time
code of at least the video signal as the index signal, and records the same time code in the
index areas of continuous plural tracks. The index area for recording the time code is
divided into a plurality of small areas in one track, and the same time code is recorded in
each small region. The leader code is recorded in the index area for recording at least the
time code.From EP-A-0 341 319, it is known a digital tape recorder in which, when the content of
start ID changes from 0 to 1, the start ID recorded in a subcode area on a tape indicates
a starting point of the program. The digital tape recorder is provided with storage means
which stores the tape position for starting a re-recording of start ID = 1, and start ID
discrimination means for discriminating whether the start ID = 1 is recorded or not just
before the tape position at which the re-recording of start ID = 1 is started. When it is
discriminated by the start ID discrimination means that the start ID = 1
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A recording and reproducing apparatus for recording a video signal and an
indexing signal (SRID) to separate video signal areas (25) and subcode areas (26),

respectively, of diagonal tracks (24-0 to 24-9) formed on a tape (1) by a rotating
head (2a, 2b), said apparatus comprising:


tape drive means (7) for driving the tape (1);
an indexing signal control means (13) for setting and resetting said indexing signal
(SRID);
recording means (22) for recording the video signal to the video signal area (25)
and the indexing signal (SRID), if any, to the subcode area (26) of each track; and
editing control means (33) for controlling said indexing signal control means (13);

characterized in that

an add command generator (40) is provided for generating an add command to add
said indexing signal (SRID) at a requested position; and
said editing control means (33) is adapted for controlling said indexing signal
control means (13) in response to said add command such that the tape (1) is

rewound by a first predetermined length past said requested position, then the tape
(1) is forwarded for recording the indexing signal (SRID) on the tape (1) in a

reset state until said requested position, and then the tape (1) is further forwarded
for recording said indexing signal (SRID) on the tape (1) in a set state for a

second predetermined length.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1,

wherein said reset state is recorded immediately before said add command is
generated.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, further comprising

reproducing means (42) for reproducing a recorded signal from said tape;
further characterized in that a switching means is provided for switching between
a recording mode in which said recording means (22) is connected to said head

(2a, 2b) and a reproducing mode in which said reproducing means is connected to
said head;
an indexing signal detection means (35) is provided for detecting set and reset
states of said indexing signal (SRID) during said reproducing mode; and
said editing control means (33) further controls said indexing signal control means
(13) in response to said add command such that the tape (1) is forwarded by a

third predetermined length for reproducing recorded signals from the tape (1) to
detect any leading edge of a previously recorded indexing signal, and if a leading

edge of a previously recorded indexing signal is detected, said indexing signal
(SRID) is recorded in a set state from a first position (P2) where said add command

is generated to a second position (P3) which is before said leading edge by
said first predetermined length.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 3,

wherein said editing control means (33) further controls said indexing signal
generator such that a reset state is recorded before said first position for said first

predetermined length.
The apparatus as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims,

further comprising a video signal generator (8) for generating a video signal in
frames, each frame having a predetermined length.
