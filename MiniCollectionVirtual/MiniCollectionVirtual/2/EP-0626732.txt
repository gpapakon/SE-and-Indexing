intercell connector (26) includes first and second buss 
bars (32, 34) disposed in spaced apart relation to each 

other and each including a base portion (40) and an

second buss bars (32, 34) respectively includes first and 

second electrode terminals (44, 46) aligned with each 
other; and an insulator (38) for insulating the first and 

second buss bars (32, 34) from each other. The connector 
(26) is disposed in the casing (24) of each of the cells 

(18) so as to extend trans-versely to the electrode plates 
(20, 22) with the casing (24) being bonded to a portion of 

the insulator (38) such that only the electrode terminals 
(44, 46) are exposed outside the casing (24). The first 

electrode terminal (44) includes a female connecting 
portion and the second electrode terminal (46) includes a 

male connecting portion to facilitate inter-connection of 
adjacent cells (18). Additionally, the electrode 

connecting portions (42) of the first and second buss bars

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intercell 
connector which is used in the construction of a CPV 
(common pressure vessel) battery. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a connector which respectively 
electrically inter-connects the positive and negative 
electrodes of a particular cell to external positive and 
negative terminals so that adjacent cells can be 
electrically inter-connected. The earliest Ni-H₂ batteries for satellite application 
employed individual pressure vessels for each cell in the 
battery. However, to gain improvements in specific energy 
and energy density and to reduce the total weight and 
volume of the battery, the recent trend has been to 
incorporate multiple cells in a stack arrangement within a 
single pressure vessel. This type of Ni-H₂ battery is 
termed in the art a common pressure vessel (CPV) battery. 
Examples of common pressure vessel type Ni-H₂ batteries are 
described in the following publications: M. Earl et al., 
"Design and Development of an Aerospace CPV Ni/H₂ Battery", 
24th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, 
Washington, D.C., August 1989, Proc., Vol. 3, pp. 
1395-1400; J. Dunlop et al., "Making Space Nickel/Hydrogen 
Batteries Light and Less Expensive", AIAA/DARPA Meeting on 
Lightweight Satellite Systems, Monterey, California, August 
1987, NTIS No. N88-13530; G. Holleck, "Common Pressure 
Vessel Nickel-Hydrogen Battery Design",  
 
15th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering 
Conference, Seattle, Washington, August 1980, 
Proc., Vol. 3, pp. 1908-1911; and E. Adler et al. 
"Design Considerations Related to Nickel Hydrogen 
Common Pressure Vessel Battery Modules", 21st 
Intersociety Energy conversion Engineering 
Conference, San Diego, California, August 1986, 
Proc., Vol. 3, pp. 1554-1559. In CPV batteries, the individual cells are 
generally disposed inside an insulating carrier. 
Each battery cell includes a plurality of positive 
and negative electrodes which are encased in a 
plastic casing or the like. Within each cell, the 
positive and negative electrodes are respectively 
interconnected to one another utilizing positive 
and negative buss bars. In order to electrically 
connect adjacent cells, it is necessary that the 
positive and negative buss bars be respectively 
connected to positive and negative terminals 
disposed externally of the casing. In this manner, 
adjacent cells can be interconnected to one another 
as necessary to satisfy specific voltage 
requirements. In order to connect the internally disposed
