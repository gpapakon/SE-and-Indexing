<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to granular magnetite
particles and a process for producing the same.
Particularly, the present invention relates to granular
magnetite particles assuming a black color and having a
small magnetization, and a process for producing the same.Granular magnetite particles according to the present
invention are mainly intended as materials for coloring
pigments for coatings, printing inks, rubber and plastics,
and materials for magnetic toners, magnetic carriers and
magnetic cards.Since magnetite particles assume a black color, they
are widely used as materials for coloring pigments for
coatings printing inks, rubber and plastics.In addition, since granular magnetite particles are
ferromagnetic particles, they are mixed with and dispersed
in a resin so as to produce composite particles which are
used as material particles for magnetic toners and magnetic
carriers for electrostatic copying.Magnetite particles are sometimes dispersed in a
vehicle so as to obtain a magnetic coating. The thus-obtained
magnetic coating is directly applied to a card
substrate or a magnetic tape obtained by applying the 
magnetic coating to a base film is adhered to a card
substrate by an adhesive. In this way, magnetite particles
are also used as material particles for magnetic cards such
as credit cards provided with a magnetic stripe, railway
tickets, railway season tickets, highway passes, telephone
cards and railway cards.In any of the above-described fields, there is no end
to demand for higher capacity and higher quality of the
products, and magnetite particles as a material are
required to have improved properties, in particular, to
have excellent dispersibility in a resin or a vehicle which
facilitates the kneading of the particles with the resin or
the mixing of the particles with the vehicle.This fact is described with respect to coloring
pigments for coatings, printing inks, rubber and plastics
in Journal of the Japan Society of Color Materials, vol.
49, No. 1 (1976), page 8, "It seems to be no exaggerating
to say that most properties wherein a coating has to
possess, are determined by the dispersibility of the
pigment in the coating film, in case where the pigment is
the same. Theoretically, if the dispersibility of the
pigment in the coating film is good, the color tone is
vivid, and the fundamental properties intrinsic to the
pigment such as a tinting strength and a hiding power are
improved. In addition, a gloss, a definition, mechanical
properties and an air permeability resistance of
