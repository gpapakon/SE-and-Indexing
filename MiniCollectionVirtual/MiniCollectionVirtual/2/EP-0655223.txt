<ABSTRACT>
A device for closing an incision or puncture 
in a patient by inserting a vessel plug (20) into the incision 

or puncture until the distal end (32) of the vessel 
plug is adjacent to the outer lumen of the blood vessel or 

target organ so that the vessel plug does not obstruct the 
flow of fluid through the blood vessel or target organ. The 

precise positioning of the vessel plug in the incision or 
puncture is accomplished through the use of a balloon catheter 

(22) or a cylindrical insertion assembly (50) having a 
proximal plunger member (54) associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to hemostatic
devices and more particularly to a closure device including
a plug which is insertable into an incision or puncture
formed in the body of a patient.During catheterization procedures, the nurse or physician
will create an opening into an artery or other vessel
with a conventional catheter introducer or dilator. The
size of the opening will vary depending on the type of
procedure and the size of the catheter which is used. For
example, the diameter of the catheter and catheter sheath
used in standard angiography procedures is typically between
5 to 8 French (1.67 mm and 2.67 mm, respectively). The
diameter of the catheter and catheter sheath used in angioplasty
procedures may be 8 (2.67 mm) or 9 (3.33 mm) French.
The diameter of the catheter and catheter sheath used in
intro-aortic balloon pump procedures is typically between 14
to 16 French (4.67 mm and 5.33 mm, respectively) and the
diameter of the catheter and catheter sheath used with
cardiopulmonary support systems is typically between 18 and
20 French (6.0 mm and 6.67 mm, respectively). Additionally,
the catheter is often twisted or otherwise manipulated as it
is advanced to the treatment site, thereby causing a further
enlargement of the incision or puncture in the body of the
patient.When the medical procedure is completed and the catheter
is removed from the artery or other blood vessel, conventional
practice has been to apply external pressure to
the entry site until clotting occurs. Because many of the
patients undergoing these procedures have been medicated 
with an anticoagulant such as heparin, the nurse may be
required to apply external pressure to the incision site for
an extended period of time. The time required to stop
bleeding at the incision is not an efficient use of the
nurses time and a painful hematoma or unsightly bruise may
still occur at the incision site because the artery will
continue to bleed internally until clotting blocks the
opening in the artery.U.S. Patent No. 4,829,994 granted to Kurth on May 16,
1989 attempts to resolve the above-described problem by
providing an apron-like device consisting of a pelvic apron
and a groin strap to apply a compressive force to the femoral
vessel of the patient. Although this device effectively
eliminates the need to have a nurse apply direct pressure to
the incision site, the decrease in blood flow through the
femoral artery caused by the use of this device may increase
the likelihood of thrombosis formation in the compromised
patie

<CLAIMS>
A closure device for sealing an incision formed in the body of a
patient wherein the incision extends from the skin (12) of the patient into a

blood vessel, duct or lumen (10, 70) of the patient, the closure device
including a plug (34, 52) comprising an elongate biodegradable member

having distal and proximal ends, the plug (34, 52) being shaped to be
received in the incision such the proximal end is adapted to be positioned

adjacent to the epidermal layer of the skin, 
characterised in that
 the distal
end of said plug (34, 52) is adapted to be positioned adjacent to the outer

surface of the blood vessel, duct or lumen (10, 70), said distal end being
orientated at an angle of approximately 25-45 degrees with respect to the

lengthwise dimension of the plug.
