<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a spark plug 
electrode (14) of a first material having good thermal 

conductivity having a core (24) of a second material 
having good corrosion resistance. The first material may 

be copper, or a copper alloy, and the second material may 
be nickel, a nickel alloy, silver, or a silver alloy. The 

electrode (14) may be produced by a method comprising the 
steps of: providing a tubular cup (28) formed of the first 

material; positioning a billet (34) of the second material 
within the cup (28); and extruding the assembled cup and 

billet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrodes for use
in spark plugs for internal combustion engines. The
invention also relates to a method of producing such
electrodes.A spark plug typically comprises an outer shell, a
central electrode, an insulator surrounding the central
electrode, and a ground electrode connected to the outer
shell and forming a spark gap with the bottom end portion
of the central electrode.Spark plugs may be provided with electrodes formed of
a single material, or may be made of two different
materials, examples of such composite electrodes being
described in our European Patent Publication No. 0537156 corresponding to WO-A-91/15887.
This documents disclose centre and ground electrodes
provided with an outer layer formed of a corrosion
resistant material, such as nickel or a nickel alloy, and
an inner core formed of a material having good thermal
conductivity characteristics and good corrosion/erosion
resistance, such as silver or a silver alloy. Also
disclosed is an electrode inner core formed of two
materials, the first material nearest to the spark gap
having good thermal conductivity characteristics and good
corrosion/erosion resistance such as silver or a silver
alloy, and a second material away from the spark gap
having good thermal conductivity characteristics, such as
copper or a copper alloy. Such electrodes are produced by
a first forming a tubular cup from nickel, positioning a
cylindrical billet of silver or copper in the cup, and
then extruding the assembled part to form the elongate
electrode.The core of copper or silver provides for better
spark plug performance due to the relatively high thermal
conductivity characteristics of the materials; the inner 
core conducts more rapidly the heat produced by the
combustion of the air/fuel mixture in the combustion
chamber of the engine, so that the electrodes of the spark
plug will remain cooler when the engine is running. This
cooling action has a positive effect on the performance and
on the useful life of the spark plug because it reduces the
corrosion and the erosion of the electrode. The corrosion
resistant nickel which forms the bulk of the electrode has
good corrosion resistant properties and thus prolongs the
life of the spark plug.One disadvantage of such electrodes is the relatively
high cost of nickel, which forms the bulk of the electrode.
Also, nickel has a relatively high hardness and is
therefore more difficult to form and extrude during the
manufacturing process.WO-A-91/15887 also discloses a method of
