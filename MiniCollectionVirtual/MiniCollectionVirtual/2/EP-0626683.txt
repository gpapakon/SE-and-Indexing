<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a microwave processing apparatus
medium and a process for the production of inorganic dielectric films. More
particularly, it relates to the production of an optical recording
medium comprising a substrate and an inorganic
dielectric film formed thereon.In recent years, there is an increasing demand
for recording mediums having a large recording
capacity and enabling a high-speed data transfer as
computer memories and image information memories. As
recording mediums that can answer such a demand,
optical recording mediums for recording and
reproducing information by the use of laser light as
exemplified by magneto-optical recording mediums and
phase change recording mediums are energetically
developed.More specifically, the magneto-optical
recording mediums have a system in which information
is recorded and reproduced by utilizing the
characteristic that the polarization plane of laser
light being reflected has a rotational direction which 
differs depending on the direction of magnetization
when the polarized laser light is shed on the surface
of a recording layer containing a magnetic material
(i.e., the magnetic Kerr effect).As for the phase change recording mediums,
they have a system in which information is recorded
and reproduced by utilizing the reversible phase
transformation between an amorphous state and a
crystalline state, caused when, for example, laser
light is shed on a recording layer containing Te and
the optical properties different from each other which
are shown in the respective states.These optical recording mediums employ such
layer configuration that in order to obtain
reproducing signals having a greater C/N ratio, for
example, an inorganic dielectric film is provided
between a recording film and a substrate so that the
reproducing signals can be amplified utilizing an
optical interference effect (i.e., the enhancement
effect), or, as shown in Fig. 4A, a recording film 401
is held between inorganic dielectric films 402 and 403
so that the reproducing light can be amplified and, at
the same time, they can serve as protective films of
the recording film 401. Another configuration is also
known in which, as shown in Fig. 4B, a reflective
layer 404 is additionally provided on the inorganic
dielectric film 403 in order to more improve the 
interference effect.To form such inorganic dielectric films, thin
films of, for example, Si3N4, SiC, SiO, amorphous Si
(a-Si), AlN, Al2O3, TiO2, Ta2O5 and ZnS have been
conventionally used.Performances as exemplified by
