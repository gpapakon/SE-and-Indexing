<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element comprising a 
photopolymerisable composition and to a method for the formation of 
images and lithographic printing plates from said imaging element. The use of photopolymerizable compositions for the production of 
images by information-wise exposure thereof to actinic radiation is 
well known. Several methods for forming images using 
photopolymerizable compositions are known. All these methods are 
based on the principle of introducing a differentiation in 
properties between the exposed and non-exposed parts of the 
photopolymerizable composition e.g. a difference in solubility, 
adhesion, conductivity, refractive index, tackiness, permeability, 
diffusibility of incorporated substances e.g. dyes etc.. The thus 
produced differences may be subsequently employed in a developing 
step to produce a visible image and/or master for printing e.g. a 
lithographic or electrostatic printing master. A difference in solubility between the exposed and non-exposed 
parts of the photopolymerizable composition is often used for the 
production of lithographic printing plates where a hydrophilic base 
is coated with the photopolymerizable composition, subsequently 
exposed and developed using a solvent to remove the non-exposed or 
insufficiently exposed parts. Such a process is for example 
described in "Unconventional imaging processes" by E. Brinckman, G. 
Delzenne, A. Poot and J. Willems, Focal Press London-New York, first 
edition 1978, pages 33 to 39. The use of the difference in tackiness to obtain an image is 
described in e.g. US-P 3,060,024, 3,085,488 and 3,649,268. 
According to the method disclosed in these US patents the image-wise 
exposed photopolymerizable composition looses its tackiness in the 
exposed parts while the non-exposed parts keep their tackiness. The 
non-exposed parts can therefore be colored with dry dye pigments to 
make the image visible. According to the methods described in e.g. US-P 3,245,796 and 
EP-A 362,827 the diffusibility of a dye is impeded in the photo-exposed  
 
parts of the photopolymerizable composition so that during 
an overall thermal heating subsequent to photo-exposure dye 
substances in the non-exposed areas will be able to diffuse to a 
receptor material. According to a similar method described in US-P 
4,587,198 the photopolymerizable composition is made impermeable in 
the exposed parts for a sublimable dye or dye-pigment present in a 
layer contiguous to the layer comprising the photopolymerizable 
compositi
