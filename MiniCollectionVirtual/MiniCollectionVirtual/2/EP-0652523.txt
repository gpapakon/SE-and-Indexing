<ABSTRACT>
A data transmitter/receiver of a centralized 
monitoring station (1) transmits data and received data 

from each of monitored stations (2-1,2-2). A polling 
level table (11) stores polling levels calculated from 

request data level and transmission data level added to 
transmission data from the monitored stations. A 

monitored station number table (14) stores the numbers of 
a monitored station to be polled with a polling level 

equal to or greater than 2 in one polling cycle. A 
polling level determining unit (13) determines polling 

levels to be transmitted to the respective monitored 
stations based on the contents of the polling level table 

and the monitored station number table. A data 
transmitter/ receiver (20-1) of each of the monitored 

stations transits transmission data level corresponding to 
the polling level and transmission data with the added 

request data level to the centralized monitoring station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remote
monitoring system, and more particularly to a remote
monitoring system having a centralized monitoring
station for collecting data from a plurality of
monitored stations that are connected to a bus network.Conventional remote monitoring systems employ
a polling process as a data collecting process for
requesting all monitored stations to transmit data. In
such a polling process, all the monitored stations are
polled in the same manner irrespective of the condition
of the monitored stations.The time established by the remote monitoring
system to collect data from all the monitored stations
is determined by the sum of times required to collect
data from the individual monitored stations. If the
proportion of data of less importance is large in the
amount of data to be transmitted from the monitored
stations and if there is even one monitored station
which transmits a large amount of data, then the remote
monitoring system needs a long period of time to
collect the data. Various data collecting systems have been
proposed to solve the above problem. For example,
Japanese patent laid-open No. 270426/90 discloses a
communication control system in which monitoring
information is given preferential ranking, and stored
in a plurality of registers according to the given
preferential ranking, so that emergency information can
be transmitted and received more quickly than the other
information.Japanese patent laid-open No. 75146/92
discloses a centralized monitoring control system in
which each monitored station is polled for confirming
an amount of data to be transmitted therefrom, and the
number of times that each monitored station is to be
polled is determined on the basis of the result of
polling.The communication control system disclosed in
the former publication is disadvantageous because it
fails to handle any monitor information which is given
priority ranking in excess of the number of
transmission and reception registers that are
installed.The centralized monitoring control system
disclosed in the latter publication also has a problem
in that it requires an extra period of time to effect
polling on all the monitored stations to check the 
amount of data to be transmitted therefrom.Preferred embodiments of the present
invention provide a remote monitoring system capable
of collecting data efficiently by preferentially
handling data of greater importance.In one embodiment, there is provided a
remote monitoring system comprising a plurality of
monitored stations
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A remote monitoring system comprising:

a plurality of monitored stations (2-1, ..., 2-N) connected
to a bus network; and
a centralized monitoring station (1) for
collecting data from said plurality of monitored

stations;
each of said monitored stations comprising
status/alarm detecting means (21-1) for detecting a status and

an alarm in the monitored station itself, condition
memory means (22-1) for storing a condition of the monitored

station itself from the detected status and the
detected alarm, level setting means (23-1) for setting a

request data level for transmission data of the
monitored station itself based on the stored condition

of the monitored station itself, and data
transmitting/receiving means (20-1) responsive to a data

transmission request from said centralized monitoring
station for transmitting a transmission data level

corresponding to the polling level from said
centralized monitoring station and transmission data up

to said transmission data level to said centralized
monitoring station;
said centralized monitoring station
comprising data transmitting/receiving means (10) for

transmitting data to and receiving data from the 
monitored stations, a polling level table (11) for holding

polling levels corresponding to the monitored stations,
respectively, calculated from the transmission data

level of the transmission data from each of the
monitored stations and the request data level belonging

to each monitored stations, a monitored station number
table (14) for holding the number/numbers of a monitored

station/stations to be polled with a polling level
equal to or lower than the second highest level in

one polling cycle, polling level determining means (13) for
determining polling levels to be transmitted to the

monitored stations based on contents of the polling
level table and the monitored station number table, and

level rewriting means (12) for rewriting the polling levels
in said polling level table based on the transmission

data level of the transmission data received from each
of the monitored stations.
A remote monitoring system according to
claim 1, wherein said data transmitting/receiving means

of each of the monitored stations includes means for
adding said request data level to said transmission

data and transmitting the transmission data with the
added request data level to said centralized monitoring

station. 
A remote monitoring system according to
claim 1, wherein said data transmitting/receiving means

of each of the monitored station includes means for
lowering the next transmission data level from the

polling level transmitted from said centralized
monitoring station by one until the polling level

becomes equal to the request data level of said
monitored station, and means for updating said request

data level with a highest level in a case where the
transmision of all of the transmission data with data

levels up to said request data level is to be completed
by the data transmission this time, said level

rewriting means of said centralized monitoring station
includes means for rewriting the polling level of the

monitored station with the transmission data level of
the transmission data received from the monitored

station when said transmission data level is higher
than the request data level of said monitored station,

and for setting the polling level of said monitored
station to a initial value of the highest level when

said transmission data level is equal to or lower
than said request data level.
