<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to grinding, abrasive cutting-off or drilling tools for working concrete, natural or artificial stone, as well as filled and unfilled plastics using high-performance abrasive, such as diamond in a sintered-metal bond. To improve the weldability of the cutting segments to the steel carrier and to improve the cutting properties of the tools according to the invention, the bond has metal-sulphide powder added to it, which does not allow any liquid-phase formation during sintering.

<CLAIMS>
Abrasive tool, consisting of a steel core (1) and through welding, in particular
laser welding, connected as a result, bonded with a sintered metal bond by the

use of one or several high-melting metal powders, cutting segments containing
high performance cutting material such as diamond and/or cubical boron

nitride, whereby a bond zone free of cutting material (4) is preferably arranged
between the steel core (1) and the cutting material containing abrasion zone

(3) of the cutting segments, the sintered metal bond contains dispersed metal
sulfides with a grit size from 0,1 up to 1,5 micrometer in proportions of 0,2 up

to 20 weight percentage, and the sintered metal bond remains solid at
temperatures up to 1200Â°C.
Abrasive tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the metal sulfides are
sulfides of metals from the group of wolfram, molybdenum, chrome, iron, rare

earths or mixtures of them.
Abrasive tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the metal sulfide
is MoS2.
Abrasive tool according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
grit size of the metal sulfide powder used, amounts to 0,2 up to 0,5

micrometer.
Abrasive tool according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the metal
sulfide share of the sintered metal bond of the cutting segments (3) amounts

to 0,2 to 2,0 weight percent.
Use of abrasive tools according to one of the claims 1 to 5 for grinding, cut-off
grinding, sawing or drilling of workpiece materials containing mineral or

mineral aggregate, such as natural or artificial stone, ceramic, concrete and
filed synthetic material.
