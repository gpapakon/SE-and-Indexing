<ABSTRACT>
Facsimile image-scaling and -smoothing method and apparatus are 
described. They scale a received facsimile image along a given axis to increase 

the printed image resolution therealong, while smoothing the scaled image to 
reduce visually objectionable ticks. They do so by analyzing received image data 

with respect to adjacent received lines having disparate pixel counts and by filling 
in pixels therebetween in accordance with predefined fill rules that are designed 

also to smooth the output image to be printed. Various predefined rules are 
applied to produce intermediate results (LS, NS, LR, NR) some or all of which 

are comprehended by the scaling/smoothing algorithm to produce the final 
smoothed, scaled output pixel image. Preferably such analyzing and filling in 

accordance with such rules are performed by a hybrid hardware and firmware 
subsystem within a receiving facsimile machine or facsimile-receiving printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the scaling of facsimile
images. More particularly, it concerns the smoothed vertical-resolution
multiplication of received facsimile images to reduce the objectional visibility of
transmitted image artifacts and to achieve higher print quality.Facsimile images typically are of one of two vertical resolution
standards, e.g. 98 lines per inch or 196 lines per inch. In facsimile reception-capable
printers and certain more recent facsimile equipment, 300 dots per inch
(DPI) vertical resolution is more common. Thus, there is a need to have higher
resolution facsimile imaging equipment vertically expand, or scale, the received
facsimile image as by filling in between vertically adjacent received dots with print
dots to render the printed facsimile image vertically full scale and contiguous, i.e.
spatially continuous. When facsimile images are produced, there frequently is a
potentially visible pixel or dot artifact called a 'tick', which will be understood to
refer to an extraneous black dot in the transmitted image that is added by the
imaging equipment above or below horizontal lines within the scanned image.
There is a need to reduce the objectionable visibility of such ticks in printed
facsimile output images. In US-A-4791491, there is described a method of
generating supplemental lines for placement between adjacent
lines of facsimile data. In this method, logical
combinations of incoming pixel data are generated so as to
generate supplemental data points which are determined by
the intersecting boundary between inverse borders. In the
preferred embodiment described, this results in the
generation of intermediate on-pixel blocks which are longer
than those of the adjacent lines of real data.In Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 7 No. 272 (E-214)
(JP-A-58153450), there is described a system for converting
the resolution of received facsimile information using a
simple algorithm.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided apparatus for processing a received facsimile image
data structure as defined in Claim 1.The apparatus of the present invention is thus arranged
so as to scale a received facsimile image along the given
axis to increase the printed image resolution therealong,
while smoothing the scaled image to reduce visually
objectionable ticks. This is achieved by analyzing the
received image data with respect to adjacent received lines
having disparate pixel counts and by filling in pixels
therebetween in accordance with predefined fill rules

said structure including first and second adjacent rows,
each row having plural pixels, each of which is in either an

on or an off state, said apparatus comprising:

   a processor for processing said image data structure,
said processor comprising: a first storage element (L) for

storing a predetermined number of pixels of said first row;
a second storage element (N) for storing a predetermined

number of pixels of said second row; and means (AND, OR)

is arranged to perform image rounding and smearing between

pixels of said first and said second pixel rows.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said first
logical combinations comprise one or more bit-wise AND
