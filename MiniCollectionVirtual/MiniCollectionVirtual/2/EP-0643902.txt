<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a stencil (3) or mask having opposite side regions (6, 7, 6', 7') adapted or modified by being apertured or of reduced thickness so as to be more flexible than the main body of the sheet from which the mask is formed and so as to enable the opposite side regions to be bent along said regions without kinking or other deformation during tensioning. The invention also relates to apparatus for enabling stencilling processes to be performed, comprising a stencil (3), and support therefor which are detachably interconnectable and such that the stencil is flexed or bent so that the interconection means do not project beneath the lowermost planar surface of the stencil in its operative position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
stencil or mask for use in applying solder paste on to
circuit boards and to a support frame therefor.It is known to produce electric circuit boards
with solder connections for components, such as
integrated circuit chips, to apply a solder paste to the
circuit board by means very similar to screen printing.
In one such non printing arrangement, a solder stencil
or mask comprises a thin but still relatively, stiff
sheet of stainless steel or brass in which fine lines or
apertures for the passage of solder paste have been
formed, for example, by etching or laser cutting. The
metal sheet is bonded to and supported by a thin
peripherally surrounding flexible perforate sheet, of
polypropylene or like, which in turn is bonded at its
edges to a rectangular rigid metal frame. Such known
arrangement is expensive and time-consuming to produce -
particularly in view of the curing time necessary for
the bonding of the adhesive. Additionally, the mesh and
mask are not removably replaceable on the rectangular
support frame without destruction of the mesh.More recently it has been proposed in WO 92/08616 to provide a
rigid rectangular support frame wherein on two opposite
sides and extending along a substantial part of the
length thereof there are mechanical coupling means for
interconnection with opposite sides of a metal printing
stencil or mask with one mechanical coupling means being
mounted on displaceable support means which are
displaceable to tension the sheet when connected between
the coupling means by suitable hydraulic pneumatic or
spring or mechanical tension devices as will be apparent
to persons skilled in the art and well known. The 
mechanical coupling means includes two metal strips
which underlie the normally lowermost surface of the
mask sheet when in the operative position of the
printing frame and mask and are coupled to the mask
sheet long two opposite edges my means of a plurality of
apertures in each strip at relatively large spacing and
secured by screws, rivets or the like. Whilst such
arrangement is suitable for relatively small circuit
boards, it does have the disadvantage of not permitting
circuit boards of large area to be printed because of
the projection of the opposite side strips of the
mechanical coupling means beneath the lowermost surface
of the mask. Additionally, the arrangement produces a
very rigid mask when tensioned which may not allow for
slight irregularities in the circuit boards which were
tolerated by the first
