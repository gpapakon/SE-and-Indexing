<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft device for a trailer having a king pin (10) 
includes a jaw (17) movable between open and closed positions. 

The jaw (17) is pivotally mounted between upper and lower steel 
plates (15 and 16) and, when in its closed position, the jaw 

(17) engages with the reduced diameter portion (12) of the king 
pin (10) and is held in its closed position by a catch (27) 

which interengages with a pawl (29). Movement of the pawl (29) 
into its release position is effected on movement of a detent 

(32) coupled to a key-operated locking mechanism (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to trailer security systems and is 
concerned with that type of trailer, normally referred to as a 
semi-trailer, which includes a king pin which is coupled to a 
skid plate on the tractor. The king pin includes a reduced 
diameter portion which cooperates with locating means on the 
skid plate, said reduced diameter portion defining, in effect, 
a groove or channel around the king pin. During the transport of goods, there are times when a 
trailer is left unattended. Unattended trailers can be a target 
for thieves, particularly if the contents of the trailer are 
valuable. A number of anti-theft devices have accordingly been 
proposed for fitment to trailer king pins and examples are 
shown in British Patent Specifications Nos. 1535774, 1572792, 
2049587 and 2248810 and in US Patent Specifications Nos. 
4067213 and 4691935.  In, for example, British Patent Specification No. 
1572792, there is shown an anti-theft device which includes a 
main body which fits over the king pin and a key-operated 
mechanism for moving a locking member between a locking 
position, in which it enters the groove or channel around the 
king pin, and an unlocking position, in which it is clear of 
the groove or channel to allow the main body to be fitted on or 
removed from the king pin. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved form of anti-theft device and, in particular, to 
increase the level of security which is obtained by use of the 
device. The majority of trailer king pins are carried on a 
mounting plate welded to the structure of the trailer. There 
is, however, an alternative design in which, to permit 
variation in the trailer turning circle, the king pin is 
carried on a plate bolted to the structure of the trailer. With 
such an arrangement, there is more than one fixing point on the 
trailer and the king pin mounting plate can be removed from one 
fixing point and then attached to the other fixing point by 
releasing the bolts. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide an anti-theft device which is suitable for use not only  
 
with standard king pin designs but also with this alternative 
king pin design. According to the present invention there is provided 
an anti-theft device for fitment to a king pin of a trailer, 
which king pin has a reduced diameter portion with which the 
device cooperates, the device comprising a main body and a 
member which is movable relative to the main body between:- 
a) a locking position in which, when the device

<CLAIMS>
An anti-theft device for fitment to a king pin (10) of 
a trailer, which king pin (10) has a reduced diameter portion 

(12) with which the device cooperates, the device comprising a 
main body (15,16,20) and a member (17) which is movable 

relative to the main body (15,16,20) between:- 

a) a locking position in which, when the device is fitted 
to the king pin (10), the member (17) enters the channel 

defined by the reduced diameter portion (12) of the king pin 
(10) so that the device is freely rotatable around the reduced 

diameter portion (12) but is not axially separable therefrom, 
and 
b) an unlocking position in which the member (17) is 
clear of the channel to permit the device to be fitted on or 

removed from the king pin (10), 
characterised in that said member (17) is in the form of a jaw 

which is pivotally mounted on the main body (15,16,20) and is 
arranged so that, when it is moved into its locking position, 

it engages with a catch (27) and is held by the catch (27) in 
its locking position until the catch (27) is released upon 

operation of a release mechanism (22,32) contained within the 
main body (15,16,20). 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the main body comprises upper and lower 

 
plates (15 and 16) between which the jaw (17) is pivotally 

mounted. 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the catch (27) is spring-loaded towards a 

release position, from which it is moved by the jaw (17) when 
the jaw (17) is moved into its locking position. 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that, when the jaw (17) is in its locking 

position, the catch (27) is held against movement towards its 
release position by engagement with a pawl (29) which, in turn, 

is only movable upon operation of the release mechanism 
(22,32). 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the release mechanism (22,32) is key-operated 

and that, when the main body (15,16,20) is fitted over 
the king pin (10) and the jaw (17) is moved into its locking 

position, no key operation is required to secure the jaw (17) 
in its locking position. 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the pawl (29) is acted upon by a detent 

(32) movable upon operation of the release mechanism (22,32). 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the upper and lower plates (15 and 16) 

are steel plates, that there is a stack of steel laminations 
(20) between the upper and lower plates (15 and 16) and that 

the steel laminations (20) are shaped so as to provide physical 
location of the release mechanism (22,32). 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 2 for use with 
a king pin (10) carried on a mounting plate (13) bolted to the 

structure of the trailer, characterised in that the upper plate 

(15) has physical dimensions such that, when in position on the 
king pin (10), it prevents access being obtained by means of a 

spanner or the like to the heads of the bolts (14) securing the 
mounting plate (13) to the structure of the trailer. 
An anti-theft device according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that the upper plate (15) includes or carries 

a generally cylindrical skirt (19) extending upwardly to a 
position in which there is just clearance between the upper 

edge of the skirt (19) and the heads of the bolts (14).
