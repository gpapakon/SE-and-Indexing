<ABSTRACT>
An explosion proof microwave heated solvent extraction 
apparatus or system for extracting organic materials includes a 

pressure resistant microwave transmissive extraction container, which 
is preferably of reinforced polyetherimide lined with fluoropolymer, 

in a microwave radiation heated chamber, with means for controlling a 
microwave radiation generating means, such as a magnetron, in response 

to the presence of any solvent vapor in a collection container for 
rupture diaphragm discharged material from an extraction container or 

in exhaust gas from the chamber. The presence of the solvent in the 
collection container or exhaust gas is preferably detected by a semi-conductor 

gas sensor which decreases its electrical resistance in 
the presence of solvent vapors, thereby increasing its voltage and 

thus controlling operation of the magnetron, turning it off when 
solvent vapor (and a potentially explosive gas mixture) is present. 

Also described are other explosion prevention means, including a 
fluoropolymer sheet covering a chamber ceiling and ceiling light, and 

a process for safely extracting organic materials, utilizing the 
described apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solvent extraction apparatuses. 
More particularly, it relates to such apparatuses in which the 
solvent employed is explosive in certain concentrations in air and 
is heated during the extraction operation by microwave radiation, 
which can result in dangerous explosive conditions if any of the 
solvent escapes from the extraction vessel and mixes with air in 
the microwave chamber. Such conditions are prevented by detecting 
the presence in exhaust air from the microwave chamber of less than 
explosive limits of such solvent vapors and turning off the source of 
microwave radiation in response to such detection. Digestions of materials in digesting liquids, such as 
strong acids, has been conducted in digesting systems wherein the 
digesting liquid is heated by microwave radiation. See, for example, 
European Patent Specifications 90308864.9 and 91304055.6, and U.S. 
Patent 5,215,715. Extractions with solvents have also been carried 
out, as reported in Volume 371 of the Journal of Chromatography at 
pages 299-306, wherein a solvent that is sufficiently polar to absorb 
microwave radiation and convert it to heat is employed. Alternatively, 
a mixture of polar and non-polar solvents may be utilized, with 
the polar solvent absorbing the microwave radiation and causing 
heating of the mixture. Although digesting acids are corrosive they  
 
are not usually explosive but many organic solvents are explosive 
when their vapors are mixed with air in certain proportions, so a 
possible problem could be encountered when conducting microwave 
extractions unless such problem is anticipated and steps are taken 
to prevent any such explosion. The present invention prevents such 
explosive incidents by detecting the presence of very small quantities 
of solvent vapor in the exhaust from the microwave chamber and 
shutting down the source of microwave radiation (which otherwise 
could ignite an explosive mixture of solvent vapor and gas) or shutting 
down the entire electrical system of the apparatus in response to 
such detection, with such shutdowns occurring when the content of 
the solvent vapor in the air is less than the lowest explosive limit 
(LEL). Thus, the invention allows the early detection of leaks in 
the system or of safety diaphragm rupture (to protect the system 
against excessive pressures). European patent specification 
91304055.6 
discloses such a rupture diaphragm in a digesting system 
but the details of construction and location can be the same for 
extraction

<CLAIMS>
An explosion proof microwave heated solvent extraction 
apparatus which comprises a source of microwave radiation, a 

walled chamber (13) into which such microwave radiation is 
directed, which chamber (13) includes an inlet (91) through 

which air may enter the chamber and an outlet through which 
air may exit the chamber (13), a microwave transmissive 

extraction container (27) in said chamber (13), adapted to 
contain, under pressure, extracting solvent medium (69) and 

material to be extracted (71), safety rupture means (59) 
associated with the extraction container (27), which rupture 

means (59) ruptures when the pressure in the container (27) 
is at a predetermined safe limit and thereby releases 

solvent vapor (67) from the extraction container (27), a 
collection container (33) into which the released solvent 

vapor (67) and any entrained solvent liquid (69) are directed 
and in which they are collected, means for passing air into 

the chamber through the inlet (91) and out of the chamber 
through the outlet, and a solvent vapor detector (101) for 

detecting the presence of solvent vapor (67) from the 
collection container (33), which solvent vapor detector (101) 

controls operation of the source of microwave radiation so as 
to shut down said source when solvent vapor (67) is detected 

by said detector (101).  
 
An apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the gas 
exhausting means is a blower or fan (95, 103) which exhausts gas from the 

chamber (13) to outside the apparatus (11) or to a collection and/or treatment 
system through a passageway (81, 83, 105), the solvent vapor detector (101) is located 

in such passageway (81, 83, 105) outside the microwave chamber (13), and the collection 
container (33) is connected to said passageway (81, 83, 105) upstream of the solvent 

vapor detector (101). 
An apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the collection 
container (33) is connected to the passageway (81, 83, 105) by tubing (35, 85) adapted to 

convey gas from the collection chamber (33) to the detector (101) and said 
tubing (35, 85) terminates in an angled opening (100) in the passageway (81, 83, 105) to create a venturi 

type effect and draw gas from the collection chamber (33) to the 
detector (101) when the blower or fan (95, 103) is in operation. 
An apparatus according to claim 3 which comprises a 
relay, switch or electrical circuitry to control the source of microwave 

radiation, and wherein the solvent vapor detector (101) is a semiconductor 
gas sensor which is capable of detecting organic solvent vapors 

by decreasing its electrical resistance in the presence of such organic 

solvent vapor, which decrease in resistance increases voltage at the 
detector and operates the relay, switch or circuitry that turns off the 

source of microwave radiation.  
 
An apparatus according to claim 4 wherein the semi-conductor 
gas sensor is of the tin dioxide type and is also sensitive 

to air flow so that voltage at the detector (101) is increased when air 
flow is slowed, which causes the source of microwave radiation to 

be turned off when air flow is halted, or is slowed objectionably. 
An apparatus according to claim 1 which comprises a 
mechanical air flow detector (109) which is moved in response to air flow 

so as to hold a switch or relay (107) in closed position in which electricity 
is supplied to a source of microwave radiation into the chamber 

and is moved to open switch position when said air flow ceases, to 
turn off the source of microwave radiation.

ceiling light (23) to illuminate the walled chamber, and a fluoropolymer 

sheet (111) covering such light (23).

vapor detector (101) is located outside the chamber (13) so 

that it detects solvent vapor (67) in air exiting the chamber 
(13), which apparatus comprises a source of an electrical 

signal, which signal is modified by the solvent vapor detector 
(101) when solvent vapor (67) is detected by it in the air 

exiting the chamber (13), and means for controlling operation 
of the source of microwave radiation in response to said 

modified electrical signal so that such radiation is terminated 
when solvent vapor (67) is detected in the air exiting the 

chamber (13). 
An apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the walled 
chamber (13) comprises a ceiling (15) having a ceiling light 

(23) therein, with a fluoropolymer sheet (111) covering the
