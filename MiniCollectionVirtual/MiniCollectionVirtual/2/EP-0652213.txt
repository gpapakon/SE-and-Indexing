<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing an alkyl 
3-phthalidylideneacetate has the step of treating phthalic 

anhydride with a monoalkyl malonate or a salt thereof 
having the following formula: 


MOCO-CH₂-COOR,
wherein M represents a hydrogen atom, K, Na, Li, or NH₄, 
and R represents a lower alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon 

atoms. By using the above method, the desired alkyl 
3-phthalidylideneacetate can be obtained at a high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing an alkyl 3-phthalidylideneacetate used as a 
synthesis intermediate for synthesizing 
4-oxo-3-phthalazin-1-yl acetic acid useful as aldose 
reductase inhibitors for treatments of various chronic 
complications caused by diabetes, such as cataract, 
retinopathy, and neuropathy due to diabetes. Conventionally, the methods for producing an alkyl 
3-phthalidylideneacetate are as follows: 
(1) A method comprising the steps of treating phthalic 
anhydride with potassium acetate in acetic anhydride, 
treating with thionyl chloride, and then esterifying the 
product with an alcohol (see U.S. Patent No. 2,483, 371); (2) A method of treating phthalic anhydride with 
ethoxycarbonylmethylenetriphenylphosphorane in chloroform 
(see Aust. J. Chem., 1975, 28, 2499-2510); (3) A method comprising the steps of treating phthalic 
anhydride with a zinc-copper couple and ethyl bromoacetate 
(Reformatsky reaction), and dehydrating the reaction 
product with a concentrated sulfuric acid (J. Org. Chem., 
1991, 56, 2587-2589, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.  
 
64-3173); and (4) A method of treating phthalic anhydride with diethyl 
malonate in toluene (see J.C.S Perkin I, 1977, 84-90). However, the method (1) comprises many steps, and the 
yield of the product is low. Also, it uses thionyl 
chloride, thereby making it industrially disadvantageous. 
In the method (2), triphenylphosphorane is used, and a 
mixture of cis-trans isomers is produced. In the method 
(3), the yield of the Reformatsky reaction is undesirably 
low, and metal waste water problems are incurred by the 
use of Zn and Cu. Further, the reaction is carried out in 
a two-step process. The method (4) is a two-step process, 
and the yield is extremely low (13%), making it 
industrially disadvantageous. The reasons for a low yield 
in the method (4) are not clear from the reference, but 
they may be presumably as follows: Although the yield of the intermediate product of the 
two-step reaction in the method (4) is not disclosed in 
the reference, an extremely low yield (9%) of ethyl 
cyano(phthalidylidene)acetate, obtained by a similar 
reaction to the first step of the method (4), suggests a 
low yield of the intermediate in the method (4). In 
addition, a selective hydrolysis of only one of esters of 
diethyl malonate to give only a Z-isomer further lowers 
the product yield. Moreover, an E-isomer may be 
undesirably produced as a side product in the second step 
of the method (4). Reaction of phthalic
