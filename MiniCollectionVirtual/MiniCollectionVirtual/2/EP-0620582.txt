<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid metal ion source for producing cobalt ion beams, in particular the source material, which wets the emitter, of an ion source of this kind. The invention comprises liquid metal ion sources, whose emitter is wetted with a defined alloy of cobalt and one or more elements from the group of rare earths as source material. With liquid metal ion sources, equipped in this manner, it is possible to achieve over a long period of time a stable ion stream which consists to a sufficient extent of cobalt ions. In cooperation with the low melting point, the components of the alloy have the result that no chemical reactions with the emitter and heater material occur.
