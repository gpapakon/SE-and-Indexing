<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the carbonylation, using carbon monoxide, of allylic butenols and/or of their carboxylic esters. More precisely, it consists in reacting carbon monoxide with at least one of the said allylic butenols and carboxylic esters, at high temperature, at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure and in the presence of an iridium catalyst and of an iodine-containing or bromine-containing promoter, the promoter/iridium molar ratio being between 0.1/1 and 20/1. This process makes it possible to prepare pentenoic acids, in particular 3-pentenoic acid, which can itself be hydroxycarbonylated by carbon monoxide and water to adipic acid.
