<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a shaping cutter comprising upper and lower blades 
(4) and (3) fastened at one end so as to open in the shape of 

the letter X and cut when they close. The upper blade (4) has an 
operating lever (6) extending from the end at which the upper 

and lower blades (4 and 3) are fastened. An endless linear conveyor (2) 
has the lower blades (3) fixed thereon, and a guide rod (7) extends 

parallel to the conveyor (2). When the conveyor (2) moves, 
the operating levers (6) of the upper blades (4) slide 

along the guide rod (7) to 
cause the upper blades (4) to move from the opening position to the 

closing position relative to the lower blades (3), thereby cutting 
into pieces an elongated edible dough running at the same speed 

in the same direction as the endless linear conveyor (2) runs. The 
elongated edible dough can be cut into pieces of a desired shape 

and size in succession. Advantageously a variety of funny-shaped 
pieces of confectionery or food can be provided by selecting appropriate 

blade shapes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shaping cutter for cutting
into pieces elongated edible dough whose cross section is round,
square, triangular or of any other shape, extruded from an apparatus
for producing edible dough for confectionery or other
foodstuff, particularly to such a shaping cutter which is
capable of cutting elongated edible dough into pieces of funny
shapes.When cutting elongated edible dough for confectionery or other
foodstuff into pieces, a high-speed rotary blade is used to cut
such elongated edible dough into pieces immediately after they
are extruded from an extruder, or a "guillotine"-like cutter is
used to cut such elongated edible dough into pieces after being
dried and somewhat hardened.The high-speed rotary blade is difficult to cut elongated edible
dough into pieces of exact length. The "guillotine"-like cutter
has the same difficulty as the high-speed rotary blade, and
still disadvantageously it can provide no clear-cut pieces, and
is liable to increase rejected or broken pieces.A spherical cutter is widely used in cutting and shaping
candies, but it is not appropriate for cutting and shaping snack
confectionery dough such as extruded from the extruder; it cannot
provide such dough pieces of same shape and size continuously. From GB-A-959788, a machine for cutting of a formed tube
advanced from a tube winding machine is known. It comprises
an endless conveyor running at the same speed and
in the same direction as the tube and having a series of
transversely positioned cutter carriers affixed thereto
at intervals apart. Each cutter carrier includes a pivotable
cutting disc being advanced to the tube and retracted
by cam means. One object of the present invention is to provide a shaping cutter
which is capable of cutting elongated edible dough into
pieces of same size and shape continuously.Another object of the present invention is to provide a shaping
cutter which is capable of providing sharp-cut pieces of desired
size and shape, guaranteed to be free of rejected or broken
pieces. To attain these objects of the present invention a shaping cutter
comprising: pairs of upper and lower blades fastened to one another
at one end so as to open and cut when they close,
said upper blades each having an operating lever extending from the
end at which said upper and lower blades are fastened; an endless
linear conveyor on which said lower blades are fixed; and a
guide rod on which the operating levers of said upper blades
slide to cause said upper blades to move from the opening

<CLAIMS>
A shaping cutter comprising: pairs of upper and lower blades (4, 3),
fastened to one another at one end so as to open

and cut when they close, said upper blades (4) each having an operating
lever (6) extending from the end at which said upper and

lower blades are fastened; an endless linear conveyor (2) on
which said lower blades (3) are fixed; and a guide rod (7) on

which the operating levers of said upper blades slide to cause
said upper blades to move from the opening position to the closing

position relative to said lower blades while said endless
linear conveyor runs to carry said lower blades, thereby cutting

into pieces an elongated edible dough running at the same speed
in the same direction as said endless linear conveyor runs.
A shaping cutter according to claim 1, wherein said endless
linear conveyor (2) is an endless belt conveyor or an endless

chain conveyor.
