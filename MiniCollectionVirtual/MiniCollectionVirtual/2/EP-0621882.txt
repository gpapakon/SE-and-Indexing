<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of structural and semi-structural composites formed by compressing sheets of nonwoven preform materials formed from aqueous blends of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic fluoropolymer pulps. The pulps are formed of film-like flakes having an irregular periphery with microfibrils extending therefrom. The composites are useful in applications which require higher strength and/or modulus, and where chemical and/or heat resistance is needed, as in chemical processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
A process for the production of composites
containing reinforcing fiber and a fluoropolymer.Polymeric composites consisting of a matrix resin
(including fluoropolymers) and a reinforcing fiber are
well known in the art. By adding the fiber to the matrix
resin certain properties of the resin alone are often
improved. These properties can include creep resistance,
tensile strength and modulus, and flexural strength and
modulus. Generally speaking, the reinforcing fiber
chosen has a higher tensile modulus and strength than the
polymer alone. When a fluoropolymer is used as the
matrix resin, as described herein, the resulting
composite often has many of the attributes of
fluoropolymers such as high temperature resistance and
chemical resistance, which make such composites useful as
parts, for example, for the chemical processing industry.
It is the object of this invention to provide a method
for the production of such fluoropolymer composites that
exhibit improved properties.U.S. Patents 4,414,356 and 4,163,742, issued to
Michel and Mansure, respectively, describe a process for
making tetrafluoroethylene copolymer-graphite fiber
composite by mixing the polymer and fiber together in a
slurry and then removing the water to obtain an intimate
mixture of fiber and polymer. It is also known that
fluoropolymers have very low surface energy and are 
difficult to wet, especially as fine particulates, in
aqueous media. Accordingly, the current art depends on
the extensive use of organic solvents and emulsifying
agents (as in the case of fluoropolymer dispersions) to
overcome this obstacle. The amount of "wetting and
dispersing" agents in such a slurry according to the art
can be comparable to the weight of fluoropolymer resin.
These organic dispersion aides must be recovered or
disposed as waste. It is highly desirable to find a
method for intimately co-dispersing finely divided
fluorocarbon and other thermoplastic resins in aqueous
media, essentially without the need for solvents and
dispersing agents.This invention involves a process for the production
of a fluoropolymer-fiber composite, comprising: co-dispersing
fluoropolymer film-like flakes having
microfibrils extending from an irregular periphery with
reinforcing fibers in an aqueous solution substantially
free of other constituents to form a homogeneous slurry;
feeding the slurry to a screen in a layer; removing water
from the layer; drying the layer to form a self-supporting
planar preform layer; preconsolidating said
preform layer by heating said preform
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a
fluoropolymer-fiber composite comprising:


(a) co-dispersing fluoropolymer film-like flakes
having an irregular periphery with microfibrils extending

therefrom with fibers in an aqueous solution
in the absence of organic solvents

and emulsifying agents
to form a homogenous slurry;
(b) feeding the slurry to a screen in a layer;
(c) removing water from the layer;
(d) drying the layer to form a self-supporting
porous preform layer;
(e) preconsolidating said preform by heating
said preform layer to above the melt temperature of the

fluoropolymer, then applying sufficient pressure normal to
the plane of the preform layer to cause the fluoropolymer

to flow to form a solid preconsolidated sheet;
(f) cooling said sheet; and
(g) forming a solid shaped composite from a
stack of said sheets by heating said stack to a high

enough temperature and applying sufficient pressure for a
sufficient amount of time to form said solid shaped

composite.
The process as defined in claim 1, wherein
said fluoropolymer is thermoplastic and said fiber is

carbon fiber.
A melt flowable fluoropolymer
thermoplastic material comprising: a plurality of flakes

having an irregular shaped periphery with microfibrils
extending therefrom, said flakes having a size

distribution of from 50 to 700 microns, the fluoropolymer
containing at least about 10% fluorine by weight, preferably at least

about 45% fluorine by weight, especially preferred if the polymer
is perfluorinated, i.e., containing essentially no hydrogen or

halogen other than fluorine bound to carbon.
