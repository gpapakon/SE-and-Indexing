<ABSTRACT>
A hand plane has a tool shaft (5b) which extends transversely to the advancing direction in the machine casing (2) and has a planing tool (3b) arranged on it. Planing tool (3b) and tool shaft (5b) form a rotational unit, on the external end face (21b) of which a central end recess (24b) is arranged. The rotational unit (3b, 5b) is mounted on two rotary bearings (22b, 23b), of which the outer rotary bearing (22b) is arranged within the end recess (24b) and is seated on a bearing part (25b) fixedly connected to the machine casing (2) via a holding part (26b). The holding part (26b) has a holding portion (27b) which is submerged in the end recess (24b) and holds the bearing part (25b), as well as a fastening portion (28b) which projects outwards beyond the planing tool end face (21b) from the holding portion (27b) in the upper region of the end recess (24b) and establishes the connection to the machine casing (2).
