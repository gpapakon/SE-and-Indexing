<ABSTRACT>
In fuel cells with an oxygen ion, hydroxide ion or proton-conducting electrolyte there is basically the problem of moistening the air of the combustion gases in order to prevent the drying out or dilution of the electrolyte and hence incorrect functioning of the fuel cell during air operation. A special problem here is the structural effort and expense of air moistening. To eliminate this drawback, according to the invention exhaust gas from the fuel cell arising on the cathode side is at least partially recirculated into the cathode of the fuel cell. The water content of the electrolyte can thus be adjusted within wide limits by simply adjusting the recirculated quantity of exhaust gas. This makes for economical use of the PEM fuel cell. The invention can, in principle, be used in all fuel cells with an oxygen ion, hydroxy ion or proton-conducting electrolyte.
