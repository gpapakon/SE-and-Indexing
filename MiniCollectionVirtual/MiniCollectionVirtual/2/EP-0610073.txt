<ABSTRACT>
A calibration pipe (10) having a predetermined length 
is connected to an end of a pipe (28) to be measured. A 

sound emitter (4) and a sound receiver (5) are connected to a 
base end of the calibration pipe. The sound emitter 

emits a sound into the calibration pipe and the pipe to 
be measured, and the sound receiver receives a sound 

reflected from a discontinuous portion of the pipe. A 
calculator is provided for calculating a period of time 

from emitting of the sound to receiving of the 
reflected sound. The length of the pipe is calculated 

based on speed of the sound in the calibration pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
acoustically measuring the length of a pipe disposed 
under a road by using sound wave, and more particularly 
to a calibration system provided for calibrating change 
of speed of sound caused by pressure, temperature and 
component of gas in the pipe. A pipe of a pipeline such as a gas main is 
disposed under a road for a long time so that the pipe 
may be corroded or broken by external force. In such a 
case, there is a method for lining an inner surface of 
a distributing pipe branched from the pipe-line with 
coating material such as resin. In order to repair the 
distributing pipe, there has been developed a method in 
which the inner surface of the pipe is repaired without 
digging the pipe. In such a method, if the amount of resin exceeds a 
desired value, the resin is unnecessarily used. If the 
amount of resin is less than the desired value, the 
pipe is insufficiently lined. Accordingly, it is 
necessary to accurately measure the length of the 
distributing pipe to be repaired.  
 Fig. 3 shows a conventional measuring system for 
acoustically measuring the length of the distributing 
pipe. The measuring system is adapted to measure a 
distributing pipe 28 having a bent portion branched 
into a residential lot of a customer, from a gas main 
29 which is laid under a street. One end of the 
distributing pipe 28 is connected to the gas main 29 by 
way of a joint. The other end of the pipe 28 is 
connected with a service riser, to an end of which a 
gas meter 15 is normally connected. The measuring system comprises a pipe length 
measuring unit 21 and a cylindrical connecting member 
16 for connecting the unit 21 to the pipe 28 through a 
lead 16b. The connecting member 16 is mounted on the 
end of the distributing pipe 28 by removing the gas 
meter 15 therefrom. As shown in Fig. 4, the connecting member 16 has 
an inner threaded portion 16a formed at an end thereof 
to be engaged with an outer threaded portion formed on 
the end of the distributing pipe 28. On the other end 
of the connecting member 16, a sound emitter 25 and a 
sound receiver 26 are provided to be exposed to the 
pipe. A temperature sensor (thermistor) 27 is provided 
in the connecting member 16 adjacent to the sound 
emitter and sound receiver for measuring the 
temperature in the pipe.  
 The pipe length measuring unit 21 comprises a CPU 
22, an amplifier 17 connected to the sound emitter 25, 
an amplifier 18 connected to the sound receiver 26, a 
D/A converter 19 connected to the

Apparatus for acoustically measuring a length of a 
pipe (28), the system having a sound emitter (4) adapted to 

emit a sound into the pipe, a sound receiver (5) for 
receiving a sound reflected from a discontinuous portion of 

the pipe, means for measuring a period of time from emission 
of the sound to reception of the reflected sound, the 

apparatus being characterised by 

a calibration pipe (10) which has a predetermined 
length and one end adapted to be connected to the end of the 

pipe to be measured; 
said sound emitter (4) and sound receiver (5) 
being connected to the other end of the calibration pipe; 
whereby the length of the pipe can be measured 
based on the period of time from the emission of the sound 

into the calibration pipe to the reception of the reflected 
sounds.

a discharge valve (14) connected to the calibration pipe at 

said other end thereof so as to discharge air in the 
calibration pipe with aid of pressure of gas in the pipe 

being measured.

the calibration pipe (10) has a helical form.  

 
A method for acoustically measuring the length of 
a pipe comprising: 


connecting one end of a calibration pipe which has 
a predetermined length to the end of the pipe to be 

measured; 
emitting a sound into the other end of the 
calibration pipe; 
receiving a sound reflected back to the said 
other end of the calibration pipe; 
calculating the length of the pipe based on the 
predetermined length and a period of time from emitting of 

the sound in the calibration pipe to receiving of the sound 
reflected at the front end of the calibration pipe and on a 

reciprocating time of sound reflected in the pipe. 
The method according to claim 4 wherein
 
   the calculation of the length of the pipe is 

performed by a following equation, 

length of pipe = (length of the calibration pipe x

receiving sound in the calibration pipe) x (reciprocating
 
period of time from emitting sound to receiving sound in the
 
distributing pipe) ÷ 2 - (the length of the calibration
 
pipe).
