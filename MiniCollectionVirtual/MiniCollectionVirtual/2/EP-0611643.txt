<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of producing point-welded or spot-welded joints between at least two layers (11, 12) of thermoplastic materials lying one against the other or close together at least in the area of the weld, the layers (11, 12) being heated to the melting temperature of the plastic at specific points or spots by heat being supplied. The novel method is characterised in that the layers (11, 12) are shaped into at least one melt bead (13) in the heated region, by applying force and forming a penetration (14), and are cooled. Furthermore, the invention relates to an apparatus for producing point-welded or spot-welded joints between at least two layers (11, 12) of thermoplastic materials lying one against the other or close together at least in the area of the weld, the apparatus having at least one heat source by which the layers (11, 12) can be heated to the melting temperature of the plastic at specific points or spots. The novel apparatus is characterised in that it has means for shaping the layers (11, 12) into at least one melt bead (13) in the heated region by applying force and forming a penetration (14).
