<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC current sensor used in a DC
leakage breaker and the like, and, particularly, it relates to a highly
versatile DC current sensor, having a relatively simple construction and a
good detecting capability against microscopic current variation, which can
be mounted very easily to a lead wire for realizing a stable detection.In recent years, many types of equipment have been developed
which use a DC current such as electric appliances incorporating an inverter,
electromobiles and the like. Such equipment requires for control a sensor
which detects the load of DC motors built in the various equipments.Current sensors used in AC leakage breakers and the like, which
include a current transformer are widely known.However, this configuration can not be adopted for use in a
leakage breaker used in the aforementioned DC current equipment, and
hence, a conventionally known shunt resistance method, magnetic
amplifier method, magnetic multi-vibrator method (Japanese Patent
Application Laid Open Nos. Sho 47-1644, Sho 53-31176, Sho 59-46859),
hall device and the like have been studied for these applications. The shunt resistance method is a method for detecting a potential
difference produced at opposite end portions of the shunt resistance which
is disposed in series with a lead wire.In the magnetic amplifier method and the magnetic multi-vibrator
method, a core made of a soft magnetic material constituted by winding a
detecting coil in a toroidal shape is used, wherein the lead wire is
extended through the core. A DC magnetic deflection of the core, made
of a soft magnetic material, within a saturated magnetic flux density (Bs),
is caused by the DC current flowing through the lead wire. In the magnetic
amplifier method, in order to give the magnetic flux variation in the core
in advance, an exciting coil is wound on the core to apply the AC current
having a predetermined value. In the magnetic multi-vibrator method, the
self-oscillation takes place by the operation of a semiconductor and the
like in a circuit connected to the detecting coil, and a duty ratio of the
oscillation waveform is changed responsive to the electric current being
detected for oscillation.Furthermore, in the hall device method, the lead wire is wound in
a toroidal shape directly around the core made of soft magnetic material,
whereon a gap portion for disposing the hall device is formed partly. The
magnetic flux variation in the core responsive to the variation in the DC
current flowing through the lead wire
