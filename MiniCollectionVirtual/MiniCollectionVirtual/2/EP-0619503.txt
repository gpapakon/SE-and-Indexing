<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to imaging of radiation
such as x-rays and the like, and more particularly relates to digital
imaging systems adapted to image objects having spatial frequency
components above the imaging system's Nyquist frequency.Solid state radiation imagers are used for imaging non-optical
radiation such as x-rays and high energy nuclear radiation
such as gamma rays. Incident radiation is typically detected in solid
state imagers through a process in which the incident radiation is
absorbed in a scintillator, resulting in the generation of optical
photons. Photosensors, such as photodiodes or the like, disposed in
an array adjacent to the scintillator detect the optical photons. The
location in the array of the photosensor detecting the light and the
intensity of the signal generated by the photosensor are processed for
display and analysis of the incident radiation. Alternatively, the
incident radiation may be absorbed directly in photosensitive
elements which convert the energy of the incident radiation into
mobile charge particles.One typical use of solid state radiation imaging systems
is medical imaging, in which radiation passing through or emanating
from a patient's body is used to visualize objects or materials within
the body. Medical imaging devices preferably exhibit high spatial
frequency response, short image acquisition time, and high detective
quantum efficiency (DQE, a measure of how efficiently an image
recorder uses the radiation to which it is exposed). Efforts to improve
spatial resolution (that is spatial frequency response, described by an
imaging system's modulation transfer function and corresponding to
the preservation of the object contrast of an imaged object in the
output image) typically include manufacturing photosensor pixels of 
smaller sizes. The pixel pitch effectively determines the smallest
resolvable dimension because a point source of light incident on a
pixel is integrated over the area of the pixel. Imager arrays of smaller
size pixels, however, require more technically demanding and costly
manufacturing methods.In the film scanning art, a number of imaging methods
for solid state imagers have been developed. For example, increased
spatial resolution has been obtained through the use of a so-called
tiled area scanner, in which the scanned area is divided into slightly
overlapping areas, with the imager having only sufficient pixels to
cover one area at a time. The images developed by one imager
sequentially passing over the areas or by
