<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothbrush, and
more particularly to a toothbrush capable of standing in
a substantially upright position on a support surface.Toothbrushes are generally stored after use in an
upright position to allow for the drainage of water. Since
most toothbrushes have relatively narrow handles, they
are not self-standing and are generally stored in a toothbrush
holder. The holder generally consists of a support
member having a plurality of holes or slots adapted to
receive and support the toothbrush handle in an upright
handle. These holders may be attached to a bathroom
wall or medicine cabinet, or may be free standing for
placement on a countertop.U.S. Patent No. 4,979,708 to Aoki describes a
toothbrush holder for infants in the shape of an animated
character. The holder also contains a suction cup
for attaching the device to a flat surface.U.S. Patent No. 1,465,642 to Keene describes a
free-standing toothbrush holder having a weighted base
and a flexible bushing for receiving the end of the toothbrush
handle opposite to the bristled head. U.S. Patent
No. 1,690,311 to Reich describes a similar holder having
an upstanding cylindrical member mounted on a
weighted base. The cylindrical member is large enough
to receive the bristled head and serves as a toothbrush
cover during travel. A resilient bushing is attached to the
end of the toothbrush handle opposite to the bristled
head. After use, this resilient bushing is inserted into the
cylindrical member and the brush is stored on an
upright position.DE-A-35 23 891 discloses a toothbrush the handle
portion of which is enlarged to allow storage of toothpaste.
The bottom surface of the handle is provided flat
and of sufficiently large diameter for the toothbrush to
be capable of being stored upright and free-standing.U.S. Patent No. 1,899,242 to McNab describes a
toothbrush holder containing a suction cup which is
attached to the end of the handle opposite to the bristled
head. After use, the suction cup is simply attached
to the bathroom wall whereby the brush is stored in a
substantially vertical position allowing for drainage. The
suction cup contains a head which fits within an aperture
formed in the end of the toothbrush. Alternatively,
the suction cup is part of an elastomeric sleeve which
fits over the toothbrush handle. Since the face of the
suction cup is in a plane substantially parallel to the
toothbrush handle, the cup must always be attached to
a vertical surface in order for the brush to be held in a
vertical position
