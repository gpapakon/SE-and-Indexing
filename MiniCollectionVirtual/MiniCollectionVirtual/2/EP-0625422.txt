<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of a glazing of bent laminated glass, particularly
a car glazing, formed from at least two individual glass sheets and

at least one intermediate, thermoplastic sheet linking said glass sheets to
one another, in which a decorative coating of a baking ink is applied by

printing to one of the individual glass sheets on the surface which is
subsequently to be in contact with an intermediate sheet and in the marginal

area, in which, following a prior drying or hardening process, the applied
decorative coating is baked at a temperature higher than that of the drying

or hardening temperature, the individual glass sheets being superimposed
with the baked, decorative coating towards the inside, the thus arranged

glass sheets being brought from a block by bending to the desired shape and
the bent, individual glass sheets are joined to one another hot and under

pressure following the insertion of the intermediate, thermoplastic sheet or
sheets, characterized in that following the application by printing of the

decorative coating and following the subsequent drying or hardening process,
to and along the decorative coating is applied by printing a baking ink

containing metallic silver which, at the time of the bending operation,
prevents any contact between the decorative coating and another glass sheet.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the baking ink
containing the metallic silver is applied by printing to the decorative

coating over at least virtually the entire length thereof.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the baking ink
containing the metallic silver is applied by printing to the decorative

coating in the form of a narrow strip 2 to 5 mm wide.
Process according to either of the claims 2 and 3, characterized in that
the baking ink containing the metallic silver is applied by printing to the

decorative coating in the form of a discontinuous strip or discontinuous
strip segments.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the baking ink
containing the metallic silver is applied by printing to the decorative

coating in the form of geometrical or non-geometrical, brought together,
discontinuous figures.. 
Process according to one of the claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the
baking ink containing the metallic silver is applied to the decorative

coating parallel to the edge of the glass.
Process according to any one of the claims 2 to 6, characterized in that
the baking ink containing the metallic silver is applied to the decorative

coating at a short distance from the edge of the glass.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
use is made of a baking ink containing metallic silver in a proportion of

60 to 90 wt.% and preferably 70 to 80 wt.%.
