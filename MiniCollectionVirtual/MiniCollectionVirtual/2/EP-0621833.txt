<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a vehicle seat which is adjustable in longitudinal position and in height and which has a mounting (9) fitted on parallel-pivoting guide rods (7; 8) hinged at fixed points (5; 6) on the bodywork. The mounting (9) has two short guide rods (21; 23) which are hinged at their other ends to two other long guide rods (13; 19). The upper ends (12; 25) of the long guide rods (13; 19) are in turn hinged to the seat frame (3) and their lower ends (15; 18) are fitted so that they point upwards. The short guide rods (21; 23) are hinged between the ends of the long guide rods (13; 19).

Vehicle seat with height and length adjustment with 
guide rods as the connection with the attachment points 

fixed on the bodywork, characterised in that a holder (9) is 
guided by means of guide rods (7;8) attached for parallel 

swivel movement to attachment points (5;6) fixed on the 
bodywork whereby the holder (9) supports two guide rods 

(21;23) which are each attached at their other end to two 
further long guide rods (13;19) which in turn are attached 

by their upper ends (12;25) to the seat frame (3) and are 
guided by their lower ends (15;18) upwards with the short 

rods (21;23) being attached between the ends of the long 
rods (13;19). 
Vehicle seat according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the short rods (21;23) are attached in the centre of the 

long rods (13;19). 
Vehicle seat according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in 
that the upwardly guided lower ends (15;18) of the long rods 

are guided upwards by means of guide rods (16;17) extending 
away from each other from a common attachment point (10) on 

the holder (9). 
Vehicle seat according to one or more of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the spacing of the attachment points 

(12;25) of the long rods (13;19) on the seat frame (3) 
corresponds at least substantially to the spacing of the 

attachment points of the short rods (21;23) on the holder 
(9). 
Vehicle seat according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the spacing between the upper 

attachment point (12;25) of the long rods (13;19) and the  
 

attachment point (14;20) of the short rods (21;23) is equal 
to the spacing between the two attachment points (14; 20 and 

22;24) on the holder (9). 
Vehicle seat according to one or more of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the lower articulation points (15;18) 

of the long rods (13;19) are guided at least substantially 
parallel to each other.
