<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a compartment 1 for the melting with an exit throat 11 bounded in the top part by a movable dam 16 which has an upper part 18 extending upwards beyond the level of glass and a lower part 17 intended to be completely immersed in the molten glass, and which has faces made of a metal or a metal alloy which resists corrosion by molten glass.

Furnace for the electric melting of vitrifiable materials and having a
cold crown, the composition (8) forming an upper, supernatant layer (9),

comprising a compartment for melting (1), a substantially horizontal floor
(6) and an outlet in the form of an immersed throat (11) for the extraction

of the glass produced and its passage into a downstream compartment (15),
characterized in that the throat (11) is defined, at least in the upper part,

by a mobile barrier (16) having an upper portion (18, 25, 26, 27a, 27b)
extending in the upwards direction to a level higher than that of the supernatant

composition and a lower portion (17) intended to be totally immersed
in the molten glass (10), having faces (20, 21) made from a metal or an alloy

of metal resisting corrosion by the molten glass.
Furnace according to claim 1, characterized in that the mobile barrier
(16) is regulatable in height (h).
Furnace according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the
lower portion (17) of the barrier (16) has faces (20, 21) made from a metal

chosen from among molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium-containing platinum or other
alloys of these metals.
Furnace according to claim 3, characterized in that the lower portion of
the barrier (17) is essentially formed by molybdenum elements.
Furnace according to claim 4, characterized in that the lower portion (17)
is essentially formed by at least one molybdenum plate.
Furnace according to claim 5, characterized in that the lower portion (17)
of the barrier is essentially formed by at least two molybdenum plates (20,

21), which partly laterally overlap.
Furnace according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
upper portion (18, 25, 26, 27a, 27b) of the barrier is made from a refractory

material.
Furnace according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
upper portion of the barrier is formed by at least one cooling element. 
Furnace according to claim 8, characterized in that the upper portion
(18, 25, 26, 27a, 27b) of the barrier is formed by cooling tubes.
Furnace according to claim 9, characterized in that the upper portion
(18, 25, 26, 27a, 27b) of the barrier is formed by at least two superimposed,

parallel and U-shaped cooling tubes (25, 26, 27a, 27b), whose horizontal
bases form the upper, median portion of the barrier.
Furnace according to one of the claims 8 to 10, characterized in that the
cooling elements are made from steel.
Furnace according to claim 11, characterized in that the cooling elements
are protected by metal plates or a covering chosen from among a vitrifiable

paint or an enamel.
Furnace according to one of the claims 5 to 12, characterized in that the
lateral ends of the barrier, at least in the lower portion thereof, are

constituted by two cylinders (23, 24), in which are partly fitted the metal
plate or plates.
Furnace according to claim 13, characterized in that the cylinders (23,
24) constituting the lateral ends of the lower portion of the barrier are

surmounted by cylinders (28, 29) constituting the lateral ends of the upper
portion of the barrier.
Furnace according to claim 14, characterized in that the cylinders (23,
24, 28, 29) are internally cooled, at least in their upper portion.
Furnace according to one of the claims 14 or 15, characterized in that
the cylinders (23, 24, 28, 29) are equipped with two independent cooling

circuits.
Furnace according to one of the claims 1 to 16, characterized in that the
lower portion of the throat (11) is defined by a submerged bar (12) at a

higher level than that of the furnace floor (6). 
Furnace according to one of the claims 1 to 17, characterized in that it
has two successive barrier positions.
