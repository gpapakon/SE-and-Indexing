<ABSTRACT>
The boundary layer of a fluid travelling in a mean-flow direction relative to a surface (104) of a wall of a body is controlled by generating in a near-wall region of the flow a magnetic field B(OVERSCORE) having flux lines (103) parallel to the surface of the wall and an electric current density J(OVERSCORE) (109) traversing the magnetic flux lines in the fluid. An electrolyte (130) or other conductivity-enhancing material is introduced into the flow to provide an electrical conductivity gradient in the near-wall region. The magnetic field B(OVERSCORE) (103) and the electric current density J(OVERSCORE) (109) create in the fluid a force J(OVERSCORE) x B(OVERSCORE) (131) having a component normal to the surface (104) of the wall that because of the increased conductivity gradient near the surface can stabilize or destabilize flow in the boundary layer. Numerous aspects of the fluid flow and its interaction with the body can thus be controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device and method
for magnetically controlling the flow of a fluid along
a wall and, more particularly, to magnetic control of
the boundary layer on aerodynamic bodies (such as
wings, rotors and flaps) and hydrodynamic bodies (such
as submarine sails, bow-planes, stern appendages and
propellers).A viscous fluid, and a body completely immersed in the
fluid, form a boundary layer at the body's surface when
the fluid and the body move relative to each other.
That is, the layer of fluid in contact with the body is
essentially at rest, while in an area removed from the
body, the fluid is moving at its free-stream velocity.
The region between the body and that area is known as a
boundary layer. The boundary layer is laminar at low Reynolds' number.
(Re = UL/ν, where U is a characteristic velocity, such
as the free-stream velocity, L is a characteristic
dimension of the body, such as the length of a wing
chord or boat hull, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of
the fluid.) When the Reynolds' number increases, the
boundary layer becomes unstable and turbulent. In some
cases, it can "separate" from the body.Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate flow over an airfoil.
It will be appreciated that the same principles apply
whether the fluid is a liquid or a gas and regardless
of the shape of the body.When the airfoil 10 is operating at a small angle of
attack α, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the fluid stream 12,
with a free-stream velocity U∞, flows smoothly over the
upper surface 14 of the airfoil. The downward
deflection of the fluid stream by the airfoil causes an
equal and opposite upward lift force to act on the
airfoil.As the angle of attack α increases, as shown in Fig.
1(b), the boundary layer may become turbulent, as
indicated by the irregular flow 17. (For purposes of
illustration, the boundary layer is depicted in Fig. 1
as much thicker than it is in actuality.) At very high
angles of attack the boundary layer may separate from
the airfoil, which then stalls. In addition to the
loss of lift caused by boundary layer separation,
eddies and turbulence 18 develop in the boundary layer.Instability leading to boundary layer turbulence at a
body's surface has several implications.First, boundary layer turbulence increases viscous
drag, which may create the need for additional
propulsive force to be applied to the airfoil or other 
body, which in turn retires more fuel to be expended
to maintain the speed of the airplane, submarine,
propeller blade, etc., to which the airfoil is
attached.
