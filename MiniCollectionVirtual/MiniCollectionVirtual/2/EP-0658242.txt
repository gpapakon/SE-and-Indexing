<ABSTRACT>
A flexible hollow sealing member (1) that can be inflated through a hole (8) in a wall thereof to seal to a first article (3) the member having: a first sealing material (10) at an inwardly-facing surface of the wall (4) which first sealing material (10) can be deformed to block the hole (8) by pressure within the member (1) when inflated; and means (18) for maintaining, during deformation of the first sealing material (10), separation between the article (3) and an outwardly-facing surface of the wall (4) immediately adjacent the hole (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to environmental sealing of 
substrates such as cables or pipes, particularly within a duct, or a 
splice case. This may be done to prevent water, gas or other 
contaminant from passing along a duct into a manhole etc, or to 
protect a cable splice from the environment. The invention will be 
described primarily in terms of a duct seal, (which term includes 
"feedthroughs") but the invention is also applicable to other instances 
of sealing, including splice cases, pipe protection and grommets etc. The reason that a seal (rather than an adhesive bond of no 
significant thickness) may be required is a disparity in size or shape 
between the substrate to be sealed and some other object such as a 
housing within which it lies. For example, a duct may be from 
several millimetres to several centimetres larger than the cable or 
other substrate that it carries, an oval cable may lie within a circular 
duct, or the installed size of a splice case housing may be larger than 
the spliced cables within it. Also, when a branch-out between two or 
more cables is to be sealed it will generally be necessary to convert 
their combined concave cross-section to a convex shape that can be 
enclosed by, say, a rigid wrap-around or other casing or by half-shells 
or a dimensionally-recoverable (generally heat-shrinkable) 
sleeve. Such seals have usually been formed by the use of a 
conformable sealing member, for example an O-ring, or the use of a 
mass of sealant or a hot-melt adhesive. Whilst these seals in general 
work in a satisfactory manner, problems sometimes occur. For 
example, by their nature, conformable sealing members have a low 
modulus and especially where they are used to fill large voids, may 
have a tendency to creep over extended periods of time. Also, leak  
 
paths may occur if it has not been possible to introduce sufficient 
heat into a hot-melt adhesive to melt it. It is for example difficult to 
introduce heat into a duct. Difficulties may also arise due to the materials needed for ducts 
and cables, which may be incompatible. Cables are often made of 
polyethylene or lead, and ducts of polyvinyl chloride, steel or cement 
which may be dirty or crumbly and difficult to clean. A widely used duct seal, disclosed in GB 1594937 (Raychem), 
comprises a hollow body member provided on its inner and/or outer 
surface with a plurality of spaced apart flanges, each flange 
extending away from and around said surface and at least a portion 
of the flange remote from said

<CLAIMS>
A flexible hollow sealing member (1) that can be inflated 
through a hole (8) in a wall (4) thereof to seal to a first article, the 

member having: 

a first sealing material (10) at an inwardly-facing surface of the 
wall (4), which first sealing material (10) can be deformed to block the 

hole (8) by pressure within the member when inflated; and 
means (18) for maintaining, during deformation of the first sealing 
material (10), separation between the article and an outwardlyfacing 

surface of the wall immediately adjacent the hole (8) 
A sealing member according to claim 1, in which the means (18) for 
maintaining comprises a spacer localized at the hole. 
A sealing member according to claim 1 or 2, in which the 
means (18) for maintaining forms a chamber (19) around the hole. 
A sealing member according to claim 3, in which the means (18) for 
maintaining comprises an O-ring (18) or a washer. 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, which 
additionally has: 


a second sealing material (6) over an outwardly-facing surface of 
the wall, the sealing material being absent above and around 

the hole. 
A sealing member according to claim 5 in which the first 
sealing material (10) comprises an oil-extended material, and the 

second sealing material (6) is oil-soluble, the means for 
maintaining (18) serving also as a barrier between the hole and the 

second sealing material. 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, in which 
the first sealing material (10) comprises a gel. 
A sealing member according to claim 5 or 6, in which the 
second sealing material (6) comprises a mastic. 
A sealing member according to claim 2 or 3, in which the 
means for maintaining (18) comprises a rubber. 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, in which 
an inwardly-facing surface of the first sealing material is 

covered with a release layer (17). 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, in which 
the first sealing member (10) is positioned between the wall and a 

flap (9) secured to the wall. 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, in which 
the wall (4) comprises a laminate of a metal and a polymeric 

material. 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, in which 
the wall (4) is substantially non-stretchable under installation and 

service conditions.  
 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, having the 
form of an elongate envelope that can be wrapped around a 

cable (2) and inflated to form a duct seal between the cable and a 
duct (3) surrounding the cable (2). 
A sealing member according to any preceding claim, which 
additionally has: 


a tube (12) through which fluid can be introduced into the sealing 
member to inflate it. 
A sealing member according to claim 15, in which the tube (12) is 
pre-installed, prior to inflation, through a hole (8) in the wall (4) and 

through the first sealing material (10).
