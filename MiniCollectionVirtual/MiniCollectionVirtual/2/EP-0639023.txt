<ABSTRACT>
A halftone screen and method for generating halftones representing a 
continuous tone image, wherein the number of halftone dots per unit 

area changes non-proportionally with the tone values in the source 
image. The method incorporates an implicit gradation compensation as 

part of the frequency modulation halftoning itself to correct for 
the additional tone gain due to recording, plate processing and/ or 

printing, as well as aesthetic corrections. This implicit 
compensation has the advantage that no external compensation is 

required, thereby maintaining the number of tone values which can be 

rendered on a digital system. Finally, the implicit gradation 
compensation enables combination of the page elements rendered 

according to either "conventional" or "frequency-modulated" 
halftoning techniques with appropriate tone-matching.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the halftoning of continuous 
tone images for use in high quality reproduction of such images. Many reproduction methods are only capable of reproducing a 
small number of stable image tones. For example, offset printing or 
electrophotographic printing methods are only capable of printing 
two stable tone values i.e. deposit ink or toner or not. In order to 
reproduce images having continuous tones, a halftoning or screening 
technique is used. In the graphic arts environment, halftoning 
techniques convert density values of tints and images into a 
geometric distribution of binary dots that can be printed. The eye 
is not able to see the individual halftone dots, and only sees the 
corresponding "spatially integrated" density value. In a more 
general context, halftoning techniques can be seen as methods to 
convert "low spatial, high tonal resolution information" into an 
equivalent of "high spatial, low tonal resolution information". (The 
qualifiers "low" and "high" have to be seen on a relative scale in 
this context). Two main classes of halftoning techniques have been described 
for use in the graphic arts field. These two techniques are known as 
"amplitude modulation" and "frequency modulation" halftone 
screening. In amplitude modulation screening the halftone dots, that 
together will give the impression of a particular tone, are arranged 
on a fixed geometric grid. By varying the size of the halftone dots 
the different tones of images can be simulated. Consequently this 
technique can also be called "dot-size modulation screening". In 
frequency modulation screening the distance between the halftone 
dots is modulated rather then their size. This technique, although 
well known in the field of low resolution plain-paper printers, has 
not obtained much attention for offset printing and other high-end 
printing methods probably because of the disadvantages to be 
discussed further on. Both classes of halftone techniques are used in combination with  
 
a digital film recorder. A typical digital film recorder consists of 
a scanning laser beam exposing a photosensitive material at high 
resolution. The "grid" that defines the resolution at which the 
laser beam can be switched on or off usually has an element size in 
the range of 1/1800 of an inch. The photosensitive material can be a 
photographic film, from which a printing plate is later prepared by 
means of photomechanical techniques. The smallest addressable unit 
on a recorder is often called a "micro

A method for producing halftone values for a frequency-modulated 
halftone image from contone pixels of a continuous 

tone image, comprising the following steps : 

generating a threshold value T according to a non-periodic
