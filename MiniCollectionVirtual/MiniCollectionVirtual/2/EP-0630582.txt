<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with a food product, and a method of 
manufacture of the food product. The product is a meat pattie comprising a 

filling in the form of a sauce for the meat which will be released when the pattie 
has been cooked. The product comprises a base [6]
 and a cover [8], generally flat 

and conveniently of circular-type shape muscle meat, having been subjected to a 
tumbling operation in brine to bring myacin of the meat to the surface. The base 

[6] is placed on a flat surface, and a slug of a filling material is placed centrally 

on the base, and a cover [conveniently provided with a decorative embellishment, 
such as a lattice of puff pastry]
 is placed over the base, and crimped onto the 
base. 
Preferably the product is subjected to a superficial cooking operation, 
cooking the product to a depth of less than 2 mm, prior to chilling, and packaging 

for sale.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to food 
products, and to methods of manufacture of food products. The invention has 
been devised primarily in relation to the production of a meat-based product, and 
in particular to a product based on the muscle meat of poultry. It is however to 
be appreciated that the invention may be utilised for meat in general terms, 
including fish, and particularly may be utilised in relation to synthetic meat 
products based on vegetable protein, such as soya. According to this invention there is provided a food product 
comprising a base of meat, a cover of meat, and a filling between the base and 
cover, the product having been subjected to a superficial cooking operation. By the provision of the superficial cooking operation, the product is 
provided with a superficial enclosed texture, without incurring the disadvantages 
of providing the product fully cooked. Preferably the product is cooked to a depth of no more than 5 mm, 
preferably less than 2 mm, and advantageously utilises an operation which does 
not involve adding fat to the product. Advantageously the cover is provided with an embellishment of pastry, 
conveniently in the form of an open-work lattice of pastry strips. The superficial cooking operation not only adheres the cover to the 
base, but also partially cooks the embellishment, and causes the embellishment 
to adhere to the cover. According to this invention there is also provided a method of 
manufacturing a food product involving the steps: 
[a] providing two meat patties; [b] treating the patties to bring myacin to the surface, such as by tumbling; [c] sandwiching between the patties a filling; [d] crimping the patties together around their edge regions; and [e] subjecting the patties to a superficial cooking operation. Preferably the method also comprises the step of chilling [but 
preferably not freezing] the product, and packaging the product. Preferably the step [e] is carried out in the absence of additional fat, 
and advantageously involves subjecting the product to hot, preferably saturated 
air, preferably at a temperature of between 50째C and 80째 for a period of between 
2 and 5 minutes. Advantageously the method involves the provision of an embellishment 
of pastry to the cover prior to the step [e]. There will now be given a detailed description, to be read with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of a food product, and a method of 
manufacture of the food product which have been selected for the purposes of 
illustr
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A food product comprising a base (6) of meat, a cover (8) of meat, 
and a filling (10) between the base and cover, characterised in that the base and 

cover are initially generally flat of circular-type shape and have a high surface 
myacin content, the base and cover being secured together around a peripheral 

line utilising the surface myacin as an adhesive, the product having been subjected 
to a superficial cooking operation. 
A food product according to Claim 1 being dome-shaped. 
A food product according to one of Claims 1 and 2 comprising a 
decorative embellishment of pastry on the cover. 
A food product according to Claim 3 wherein the pastry is in the form 
of a lattice. 
A food product according to one of Claims 3 and 4 wherein the 
embellishment is of puff pastry. 
A food product according to any one of the preceding claims, in which 
the cooking operation has not added any additional fat to the product. 
A method of manufacturing a food product of the kind comprising a 
base (6) of meat, a cover (8) of meat, and a filling (10) between the base and 

cover, involving the steps: 

a) providing two generally flat patties having a high surface myacin level; 
b) placing the base on a flat surface; 
c) placing the filling material on the base; 
d) placing the cover over the filling on the base; 
e) securing the cover and base together around the periphery thereof by 
pressure utilising the surface myacin as an adhesive; 
f) subjecting the food product to a superficial cooking operation so that 
the superficial protein of the product is "set" to retain the base and cover secured 

together. 
A method according to Claim 7 involving the step of applying a 
decorative embellishment of pastry to the cover. 
A method according to one of Claims 7 and 8 in which the filling is 
placed on the base whilst cold. 
A method according to Claim 9 wherein the filling is placed on the 
base whilst frozen. 
A method according to any one of Claims 7 to 10 in which the 
superficial cooking operation is carried out in the absence of fat. 
A method according to Claim 11 in which the superficial cooking 

operation involves subjecting the product to hot preferably saturated air 
preferably at a temperature of between 50째C and 80째C for a period of between 

two and five minutes.
