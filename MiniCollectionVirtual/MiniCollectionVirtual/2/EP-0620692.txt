<ABSTRACT>
Tint detection circuit for automatically selecting a desired tint in a video 
signal, comprising:

 
   a limit-signal generator (S1, 17, 18, 1, 15, 16) coupled to receive first 

(R), second (G) and third (B)color signals in order to generate first and second limit 
signals (CRITR, CRITB);

 
   a color-difference generator (11, 12) coupled to receive the first (R), 

second (G) and third (B) color signals in order to generate first and second color 
difference signals (G-R, G-B); and

 
   a window comparator (13, 14, 19) coupled to the limit-signal generator 

(S1, 17, 18, 1, 15, 16) and to the color-difference generator (11, 12) in order to 
determine whether the first and second color difference signals (G-R, G-B) are within 

the windows determined by the first and second limit signals (CRITR, CRITB) so as to 
supply a tint detection signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tint detection circuit. Such a circuit is used in a
television camera, for example for adjusting skin contours in a different way than for
other tints. It is also possible to control other aspects with a (skin) tint detection signal
obtained, such as RGB-YUV matrixing, color saturation, etc. The invention also relates
to a camera provided with a tint detection circuit. Yet another aspect of the invention
relates to a method of automatically selecting a desired tint in a videosignal.A separate fleshtone contour control is described in US-A-4,506,293. The
contour signal of the camera is modulated with a keying signal from a skintone detector.
The circuit described in US-A-4,506,293 starts from a fixed vector in the R-Y, B-Y
diagram, viz. the I axis. Other cameras (Ikegami) have a manually selectable vector (R-hue
and B-hue keys) for selecting the desired skintone. Thus, all these skin contour
control circuits known so far operate without an automatic selection of the skintone at
which the circuit must be active.A problem of such an automatic or non-automatic selection of the skintone
at which the circuit must be active is that skintones may vary considerably from person
to person. A circuit having a fixed skin contour control as described in US-A-4,506,293
will therefore have to be little selective and will thus also select many unwanted
background colors of the scene. A manual selection of the correct skintone is better but
is rather cumbersome, which has a detrimental influence on the convenience of use of
the Ikegami circuit. An automatic control device which automatically selects the
skintone at which the circuit must be active will therefore be preferred from a user's
point of view.It is, inter alia an object of the invention to provide an automatic control
device which automatically selects a desired tint. To this end, a first aspect of the 
invention provides a circuit as defined in claim 1. A second aspect of the invention
provides a camera as defined in claim 3. A third aspect of the invention provides a tint
selection method as defined in claim 4. An advantageous embodiment of the invention
defined in the sub-claim 2 has for its object to render the selection of tints automatic
while making use of the greater part of existing automatic devices in the camera
(automatic white balance control).These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and
elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.In the drawings

first (R), second (B) and third (G) color signals in order to generate first (CRITR) and

second (CRITB) limit signals;
color-difference generating means (11, 12) coupled to receive said first
(R), second (B) and third (G) color signals in order to generate first (G-R) and second

(G-B) color difference signals; and

generating (1,15, 16) said first (CRITR) and second (CRITB) limit
signals in dependence upon output signals of said adding step (17,18) and said third
