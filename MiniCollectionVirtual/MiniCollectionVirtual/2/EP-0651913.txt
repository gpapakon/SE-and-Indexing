<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement for bioelectrical applications one uses a photosensitive biological material. According to the invention, rhodopsin-containing micro-organisms or cells are used as photosensitive biological material. It has been discovered that the same photoelectric effect is thus obtained as by using highly purified photosensitive molecules. The advantage thereof consists in avoiding the costly purification of biological materials.
