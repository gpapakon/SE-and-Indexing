<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to implantable devices comprising homogeneous membranes composed
of acrylic copolymers. The membranes are useful in the fabrication of
biosensors intended for in vitro use, particularly glucose
sensors.Monitoring of many physiological parameters of medical
significance is performed in clinical chemistry laboratories
which are remote from the patient. Because of the time delay
involved, the information obtained is historical and may not
reflect the current state of the patient. As a consequence,
many researchers are attempting to develop biosensors to be
used in vivo which would provide real time data for a number
of analytes of clinical importance. An excellent summary of
current research in this area has been published by Collison
and Meyerhoff (Analytical Chemistry, 62, 425-437, 1990).A primary requirement of such sensors is that they be
compatible with the body. At a minimum, the materials used
to fabricate the sensor must not exert any toxic or allergic
effects on the body. In addition, sensors intended to be
used in contact with blood must not provoke a thrombotic
reaction. Few polymer materials can meet the stringent
requirements of medical applications. Vadgama (Sensors and
Actuators, B1, Nos. 1-6, 1-7, 1990) has summarized the
problems involved with interfacing a biosensor with the
biological environment.A second requirement for biosensors intended for in vivo
use is that the sensing element must exist in a stable 
environment. If the environment that the sensing element is
exposed to is constantly changing, the sensor will experience
"drift", and the values returned by the sensor will be in
error. Thus, the sensing element must be "protected" in some
way from the harsh biological environment. This is generally
accomplished by interfacing a membrane between the sensing
element and its environment. Such membranes must be
biocompatible or the reaction of the body, e.g., thrombosis
or an inflammatory reaction, will result in a continuing
perturbation of the environment to which the sensing element
is exposed. Thus, biocompatibility of membranes used in the
fabrication of biosensors is necessary not only for reasons
of safety, but also in order for the sensor to function at
all. Wilkins and Radford (Biosensors & Bioelectronics, 5,
No. 3, 167-213, 1990) have examined these issues for several
biomaterials.A final requirement, obviously, is that the sensor must
accurately measure the analyte of interest. The sensing
element is potentially exposed to body proteins,
electrolytes,
