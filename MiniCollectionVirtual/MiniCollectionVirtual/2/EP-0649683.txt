<ABSTRACT>
The dispensing assembly includes a container (8) containing the product, a dispensing head (20) having a dispensing channel (21), a flexible membrane (30) having a dome-shaped part (32) which defines, in the dispensing head (20), a variable-volume compression chamber (50) in communication with the container (8); an inlet valve (133) is placed in this communication and only allows the product to pass from the container (1) to the compression chamber (50); the said flexible membrane (30) is held on the dispensing head (20) by a fixing element consisting of a ring (40) having an opening (42) from which the compression dome (32) of the flexible membrane (30) emerges. The ring (40) has an annular projection (41) surrounding the said opening (42), the dispensing head (20) being provided with an annular groove (25) receiving an annular groove (34) which the flexible membrane (30) possesses and which surrounds the compression dome (32) of the flexible membrane (30), the annular projection (41) of the ring (40) being forcibly inserted into the annular groove (34) of the flexible membrane (30).

Assembly for dispensing a liquid to pasty
product, which includes a container (1, 8, 101) holding

the product, a dispensing head (20, 120) having a dispensing
channel (21), a flexible diaphragm (30) possessing

a part in the form of a dome (32) which defines, in
the dispensing head (20, 120), a variable-volume compression

chamber (50) in communication with the container (1,
8, 101), an inlet valve (133) being placed in this

communication and allowing the product to pass only from
the container (1, 8, 101) to the compression chamber

(50), the said compression chamber (50), the inlet valve
(33) and a dispensing valve constituting a pump for

dispensing product, the said flexible diaphragm (30)
being held against the dispensing head (20, 120) by a

fixing element consisting of a ring (40) possessing an
opening (42) from which the compression dome (32) of the

flexible diaphragm (30) emerges, the dispensing valve
consisting of a closure system located at the terminal

part, which opens onto the outside, of the dispensing
channel (21), the said closure system consisting of a

seat (20A) and of a springy leaf (31) at least partially
in contact with the seat (20A) when there is no dispensing,

moving away at least partially from the said seat
(20A) under the pressure of the product to be dispensed

and coming back, by elasticity, into its initial position
when the dispensing ceases, the springy leaf (31) being

moulded as a single piece with the flexible diaphragm
(30), characterized in that the ring (40) bears an

annular projection (41) surrounding the said opening
(42), the dispensing head (20, 120) being provided with

an annular groove (25) receiving an annular groove (34)
which the flexible diaphragm (30) possesses and which

surrounds the compression dome (32) of the flexible
diaphragm (30), the annular projection (41) of the ring

(40) being inserted into the annular groove (34) of the
flexible diaphragm (30).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the inlet valve (33) is advantageously moulded as a 

single piece with the flexible diaphragm (30).
Assembly according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the dispensing head (20, 120) is

mounted so as to rotate between at least two positions,
a position in which a communication between the compression

chamber (50) and the container (1, 8, 101) is closed
and a position in which the said communication is open.
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in
that it comprises a rigid bottle (1, 101) to which a

support (10, 110) is fixed, the dispensing head (20, 120)
being rendered axially integral with the said support

(10, 110) and free to rotate with respect to it.
Assembly according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the support (10, 110) possesses an internal cylindrical

outer skirt (13) housed in a sealed manner in the
annular space lying between an internal tubular part (23)

and an external tubular part (24) which the dispensing
head (20, 120) possesses.
Assembly according to one of Claims 3, 4 and 5,
characterized in that a port (18) passes through the wall

of the internal cylindrical outer skirt (13) of the
support (10, 110), the internal (23) and external (24)

tubular parts of the dispensing head (20, 120) being
respectively provided with a longitudinal slot (26) and

with a passage (27), these facing each other, the passage
(27) emerging into the compression chamber (50) and being

able to be closed off by the inlet valve (33), the
internal cylindrical outer skirt (13) of the support (10,

110) and the internal tubular part (23) of the dispensing
head (20, 120) communicating with the container (1, 8,

101), the longitudinal slot (26) and the passage (27)
being placed so as to face the port (18) in that position

of the dispensing head (20, 120) with respect to the
support (10, 110) for which the communication between the

compression chamber (50) and the container (1, 8, 101) is
open.
Assembly according to either of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that the container (8) is a flexible bag

housed inside the rigid bottle (1, 101) and rendered 
integral, in a sealed manner, with a sleeve (19) prolonging

the internal cylindrical outer skirt (13) of the
support (10, 110) towards the inside of the bottle (1,

101), the bottom of the rigid bottle (1, 101) including
an air-uptake orifice (3).
Assembly according to either of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that the container is the rigid bottle

(1, 101) and the assembly comprises a dip tube (7) going
down to near the lower part of the rigid bottle (1, 101)

and being connected, at its upper part, to the internal
cylindrical outer skirt (13) of the support (10, 110).
Assembly according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the ring (40) is produced by

injection overmoulding of a rigid material over the
flexible diaphragm (30).
