<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing YBCO superconducting thin 
films is obtained which is capable of providing superconducting 

thin films having excellent crystallinity in a high yield by 
introducing a new film formation parameter in a hybrid plasma 

sputtering method. When a Y-Ba-Cu-O type superconducting thin 
film is formed by using a parallel plate sputtering method, a 

high-frequency voltage generated by a high-frequency power 
source is superimposed on a DC voltage generated by a DC power 

source and applied to the cathode electrode at the same time, an 
electrically conductive YBCO target is placed on the cathode, 

and the film formation conditions are controlled on the basis of 
the difference between the voltage drops in each ion sheath 

formed on the substrate and directly on the target by applying a 
DC voltage to a substrate holder from the DC power source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing Y-Ba-Cu-O (hereinafter referred to as YBCO) 
superconducting thin films having excellent crystallinity using 
a sputtering phenomenon. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a method of optimizing film formation 
conditions so that the composition ratio of Y:Ba:Cu of a film 
becomes 1:2:3. The film is suitable for use in the electronics 
field of sensors, electronic devices or the like using thin 
films. The hybrid plasma sputtering method is available as a 
parallel plate sputtering method for forming Y-Ba-Cu-O type 
superconducting thin films on substrates. The characteristic 
feature of the hybrid plasma sputtering method is that a high-frequency 
voltage is applied to the cathode electrode being 
superimposed on a DC voltage supplied through a low-path filter 
which cuts off the high-frequency voltage, wherein a conductive 
YBCO target is placed on the cathode and sputtered in a low 
vacuum. According to this method, YBCO thin films having 
excellent crystallinity can be obtained (see, for example, 
W.Ito et al., "Highest Crystallinity of a-axis YBCO films by DC-94.92 
MHz Hybrid Plasma Magnetron Sputtering", Physica C 
204(1993) pp.295-298). According to the hybrid plasma sputtering method, when 
a bias voltage applied from a DC power source is increased at  
 
the same time as a high-frequency voltage is applied to the 
cathode electrode, an electric current increases sharply from a 
certain voltage, in correspondence with the conductance of a 
target, and enters into a so-called constant voltage region as 
shown in Fig. 7. At this time, a DC plasma is superimposed on a 
high-frequency plasma (hereinafter referred to as a hybrid 
plasma state). Use of such plasma makes it possible to speed up 
the film formation while maintaining the advantage of the high-frequency 
plasma which contributes to crystallinity. Fig. 7 
shows the relationship between a bias voltage applied to the 
cathode and an electric current when a DC voltage and a high-freequency 
voltage are applied together on a YBa2Cu3Ox target 
having a composition ratio of Y:Ba:Cu of 1:2:3. The target 
voltage is a voltage in which a negative bias voltage generated 
by a DC power source is superimposed on the self bias on the 
cathode side generated by the high-frequency plasma which is 
caused by a high-frequency voltage applied to a YBa2Cu3Ox 
target. The target current is the electric current which flows 
when the target voltage is applied. By optimizing the film
