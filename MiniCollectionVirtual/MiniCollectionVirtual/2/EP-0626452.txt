the bacterium 
Streptococcus
suis
 with a molecular weight 
of about 54 kD, capable of inducing neutralising 

antibodies against 
Streptococcus
suis

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a polypeptide of
Streptococcussuis, a vaccine for the protection of pigs
against diseases caused by Streptococcus suis,
antibodies reactive with the Streptococcus suis
polypeptide and a method for the preparation of such a
vaccine.Streptococcussuis has been identified as a major cause
of contagious disease in pigs, which is characterised by
arthritis, septicemia, meningitis, pericarditis,
endocarditis, polyserositis and/or pneumonia (Clifton-Hadley,
F.A.; Br. Vet. Journ. 139: 1-5 (1983), Vecht et
al; Vet. Quarterly 7: 315-321 (1985), Windsor, R.S.; Vet
rec. 101: 378-379 (1977), Higgins et al; Can. J. Vet.
Res. 54: 170-173 (1990), Devriese et al; Vet. Rec. 127:
68 (1990))
Morbidity is especially high in piglets between 3-12
weeks of age (Windsor, R.S. and Elliot, S.D.; J. Hyg.
Camb., 75: 69-78 (1975), Guise et al; Vet. Rec. 117: 43-44
(1985), Hoffman, L.J. and Henderson; L.M. Am. Assoc.
Vet. Lab. Diagnosticians 28th Ann. Proc. 201-210
(1985)). Although swine of all ages are susceptible to
this bacterial agent, mortality in swine over 14 weeks
of age is low. (Guise et al; Vet. Rec. 117: 43-44
(1985), Hoffman, L.J. and Henderson; L.M. Am. Assoc.
Vet. Lab. Diagnosticians 28th Ann. Proc.: 201-210
(1985)).
Occasionally, the organism is also associated with
disease in other animal species and man (Devriese et al;
Vet. Rec. 127: 68 (1990), Hommez et al; Vet. Rec. 123:
626-627 (1988), Arends et al; Rev. Infect. Dis 10: 131-137
(1988), Gottschalk et al; J. Clinic. Microbiol. 27:
2633-2636 (1989), Arends, J.P. and Zanen. H.C.; Rev.
Infect. Dis 10: 131-137 (1988)). Infection in these
cases usually occurs through skin lesions.S.suis disease has first been described from the
Netherlands by DeMoor (DeMoor, C.E.; Antonie van
Leeuwenhoek 29: 272-280 (1963)). Since then, other
researchers have reported outbreaks from other European
countries as well as from Canada, the United States and
Australia. (Sanford, E. and Tilker, M.E.; J. Am. Vet.
Med. Assoc. 23: 5-97 (1982), Perch et al; J. Clin.
Microbiol. 17: 993-996 (1983), Larson, D.J. and Kott,
B.; Am. Assoc. Vet. Lab. Diagnosticians 28th Ann. Proc.:
121-130 (1985), Guise et al; Vet. Rec. 117: 43-44
(1985), Clifton-Hadley, F.A.; Br. Vet. Journ. 139: 1-5
(1983).Streptococcussuis strains have been subdivided in a
large number of different serotypes.
Serotype determination is based on the capsular
polysaccharide antigen (Koehne et al; Am. J. Vet. Res.
40: 1640-1641 (1979), Perch et al; J. Clin. Microbiol.
17: 993-996 (1983)).
