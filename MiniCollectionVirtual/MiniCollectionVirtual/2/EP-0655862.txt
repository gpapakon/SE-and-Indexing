<ABSTRACT>
The television signal processing apparatus receives 
a video signal including a main signal (y,c) and a 

helper signal (VT,VH,AH), and produces a signal for display based on 
the main signal and the helper signal, the main signal 

being arranged in a predetermined portion of the screen 
having a first aspect ratio and representing a picture 

having a second aspect ratio, and the helper signal being 
used for improving the quality of picture of the main 

signal. The television signal processing apparatus 
includes: a noise/ghost detection circuit for detecting 

the level of at least one of noise and ghost included in 
the video signal, and for producing at least one control 

signal (ki) based on the detected level; a first signal processing 
circuit for receiving the main signal and for 

producing a first reproduction signal by processing the 
main signal; a second signal processing circuit for 

receiving the main signal and the helper signal, and for 
producing a second reproduction signal by processing the 

main signal and the helper signal; a mixing circuit (113) for 
receiving the control signal and the first and second 

reproduction signals, and for adding the first and second 
reproduction signal with respective weights in accordance 

with the control signal; and a circuit for converting an 
output signal of the mixing circuit into the signal for 

display. If the video signal includes noise and/or 
ghost, the image quality is prevented from being degraded 

due to the addition of the helper signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television-signal 
processing apparatus in accordance with standards 
for a wide-screen television system, and a television-signal 
processing method used in the apparatus. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a television-signal 
processing apparatus which is capable of 
processing wide-screen pictures of high quality with an 
aspect ratio which is wider than 4:3, while maintaining 
the compatibility with the conventional television system 
using the current standards of an aspect ratio of 4:3 
(= 1.33), and a television-signal processing method used 
in the apparatus. In recent years, studies have been conducted on 
a wide-screen television broadcasting system such as a 
second-generation enhanced television system (hereinafter 
referred to as "EDTV2"), which is compatible with the 
current standards of conventional television broadcasting 
system. A letter-box method is adopted as a method for 
transmitting video signals in EDTV2 so that wide-screen 
(wide aspect ratio) motion pictures in EDTV2 broadcasting 
can be adapted to the television standard of 1.33. In 
the letter-box method, scanning lines in a center portion 
excluding the upper and lower portions of a screen frame 
are used for transmitting a picture with an aspect ratio 
of 16:9 as a main signal (hereinafter, the center portion 
is referred to as a main panel). At this time, no pictures 
are displayed in the upper and lower portions of a 
screen with an aspect ratio of 4:3 (hereinafter, the  
 
upper and lower portions are referred to as upper and 
lower panels, respectively). As shown in Figure 3, in 
the screen of a television receiver, upper and lower 
panels 31 and 33 are displayed as black bars, and a main 
panel 32 is displayed as a wide picture with a large 
aspect ratio in the center portion of the screen. It has been proposed that helper signals for 
improving the image quality displayed on the receiver are 
transmitted by using the upper and lower panels. In 
addition, in EDTV2, it is proposed that a helper signal 
is transmitted through a 3-dimensional conjugate area (a 
Fukinuki hole) of a chrominance signal. For example, a 
vertical-temporal frequency high signal (a VT signal), a 
vertical frequency high signal (a VH signal), and a 
horizontal frequency high signal (an HH signal) may 
function as such a helper signal. The receiver can 
obtain a picture of high image quality by adding these 
helper signals to the main signal (for example, see ITE 
Technical Report Vol. 17,
