<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel linear and cyclic
peptides and mixtures and combinations thereof useful for
detecting and quantifying rubella infections and for eliciting
antibodies specific to the rubella virus. These
peptides are also useful in the manufacture of vaccines
against rubella viral infections. The peptides described in
this invention may be useful for distinguishing between
various types of immune status to rubella. At least one of
the described peptides has the ability to recognize specifically
rubella neutralizing antibodies.Rubella was first described in Germany in the
18th century and is, therefore, often referred to as German
measles. It is a highly contagious disease characterized
by a general rash and a mild fever. Its clinical aspects
were, for a long time, confused with other infections,
including measles. The major risk associated with rubella
infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy
when severe damage to the fetus can result in deafness,
cataracts, cardiac abnormalities and microencephaly.The rubella virus, the etiologic agent of
rubella, belongs to the Togaviridae family. It is a
roughly spherical enveloped virus about 60 nm in diameter.
Its genome consists of a single positive stranded RNA
(10 Kb). The structural polyprotein encoded by this
genome consists of two envelope glycoproteins - E1 (58K)
and E2(42-47K) - and a nucleocapsid protein - C(33K) -. The
viral envelope includes components from the host infected
cell membrane, and the two viral glycoproteins E1 and E2.
These envelope glycoproteins are responsible for the
hemagglutination activity of the rubella virus. E1 and E2 
glycoproteins are linked by disulfide bonds to form homo- and
heterodimers.Three strains of rubella virus (Therien, Judith,
M33) have been described and portions of their genomes have
been sequenced (Frey et al., 1986, Virology 154, 228-232;
Terry et al., 1988, Arch. Virol. 98, 189-197; Clarke
et al., 1987, Nucl. Acids Res. 15, 3041-3057). The
sequences of rubella vaccine strain (BA 27/3) is also known
(Nakhasi et al., 1989, Nucl. Acids Res. 17 (11), 4393-4394).Although rubella can be diagnosed by inoculating
infected materials (usually nasopharyngeal secretions)
into susceptible cell cultures, the most widely used diagnostic
tests are based on the hemagglutinating properties
of its glycoproteins. In those assays ("HAI"), the
presence in a serum sample of antibodies to the hemagglutinin
prevents the virus from binding to red blood cells
(usually from chicken blood) thus inhibiting
