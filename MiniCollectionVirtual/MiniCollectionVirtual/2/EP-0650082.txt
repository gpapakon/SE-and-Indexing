<ABSTRACT>
A smart optical connector (100) sends and recieves 
optical signals over optical fibers (200, 202). The smart otical 

connector (100) is capable of converting electrical signals to 
optical signals for transmission, and capable of converting 

optical signals to electrical signals for reception. Addtionally, 
the smart optical connector (100) comprises circuitry (217) 

for modifying the format of the electrical signals to provide 
compatibility between various equiptment (414, 416, 418) 

which require differing formats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to connectors 
for electronic equipment, and more particularly, to smart 
optical connectors. It is sometimes desirable to provide communications 
between two or more electronic devices with optical cables. 
Optical cables provide extremely large bandwidths which allow 
tremendous amounts of data to be transmitted at very high 
speeds. However, the use of optical cables gives rise to a 
variety of challenges. It should be understood that typical electronic equipment 
requires data and other signals in electronic form. In order to 
use optical cables for the communication of these electrical 
signals, the electrical signals must be converted into optical 
signals, and back again into electrical signals. Furthermore, 
particular types of electronic equipment require data and other 
electrical signals in corresponding particular formats. For 
instance, there are a variety of industry standards and 
specifications to which various equipment are built. Examples 
are equipment requiring signals and data formatted according 
to the the industry standard RS 232, as well as equipment 
requiring signals and data according to the industry standard 
IEEE 488. In the past, separate systems have been provided to 
convert the electrical signals and data into optical signals for 
transmission over optical cables, and to convert one electrical 
signal and data format into another, as necessary to interlink 
various different equipment.  What is needed is a way to interconnect differing types 
of electronic equipment, using optical cable, which does not 
require one system for reformatting electrical signals and data 
and a separate system for converting electrical signals to 
optical signals for transmission over the cable. FIG. 1 is a top view of a smart optical connector system 
in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention; FIG. 2 is a perspective cut away view of a smart optical 
connector in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the 
present invention; FIG. 3 is a bottom view of the connector of FIG. 2; and FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a distributed data bus 
network employing smart optical connector systems in 
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention. The present invention consist of a fiber optic ribbon 
terminating at the end in one or more modules permanently 
attached to the ribbon. The module is capable of both sending 
and receiving optical signals. A optical signal received will 
have additional processing
