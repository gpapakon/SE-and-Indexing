<ABSTRACT>
A form-in-place conductive gasket is disclosed. 
The gasket, foamed, gelled or unfoamed is made of one or 

more elastomer resins, such as silicone urethane and/or 
thermoplastic block copolymers and is either filled with a 

conductive filler and lined onto a desired substrate or 
lined onto the substrate unfilled and then coated with a 

conductive outerlayer, such as a silver filled elastomer 
or a conductive flocked layer. A process and system for 

making the gaskets are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conductive 
form-in-place gaskets. More particularly, it relates to 
conductive form-in-place gaskets having two, three or more 
axes of direction (e.g. X, Y and/or Z) and a process and 
system for making them. EMI shielding gaskets are used on electronic 
equipment to provide protection against interference from 
electromagnetic energy, including radio frequency 
interference (RFI) and more broadly all bands of 
interference commonly called electromagnetic interference 
(EMI). The shielding has an electrically conductive 
element, be it a wire mesh, conductive filler or 
conductive plating, coating or fabric which prevents 
external EMI from interfering with an electronic device 
and/or protects other adjacent electronic devices from EMI 
emitted by an electronic device. Typically, EMI gaskets are prepared in one of three 
configurations: linear, die cut or compression molded. 
By linear, it is meant as an extrusion, molding, etc. of a 
defined, straight length. By die cut, it is meant that a 
gasket configuration is formed from a conductive sheet 
material which is cut by a die to the desired shape, such 
as round, square, etc. By compression molded, it is meant 
that the gasket configuration is formed by placing uncured 
elastomer which may contain conductive filler or a 
conductive mesh, into a specifically designed mold which 
is then subjected to compression (pressure) and then cured 
to cause the elastomer to assume the desired gasket 
configuration. All three methods have disadvantages especially 
when used to form complex multidirectional or multiaxial 
gaskets, such as may occur in devices with a number of 
compartments that each need to be shielded, from each  
 
other as well as the external environment. Moreover, the 
problems are even more critical on smaller devices, such 
as cellular phones, notebook computers and other hand held 
devices, where the diameter of the gasket becomes very 
small and the ability to manufacture and attach such 
gaskets securely becomes very difficult and labor 
intensive. Using linear gasketing material to form complex 
multiaxis/multidirectional gaskets (e.g. either x and y or 
in the x, y and z planes), is difficult, time consuming 
and costly. Each gasket portion must be hand cut and 
bonded to the adjacent portions of other linear gaskets 
and then bonded or secured in position upon the substrate. Die cutting of conductive sheet stock will work in 
many instances especially in two plane (e.g. flat; x,y) 
applications,

composition formed of a silicone resin, one or more 

conductive fillers, a curing agent for the resin wherein 
the composition, when mixed and applied to a substrate,
