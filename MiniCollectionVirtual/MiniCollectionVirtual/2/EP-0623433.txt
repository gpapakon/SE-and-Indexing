<ABSTRACT>
A process for upgrading low-quality wood to high-quality wood, 
comprising: 


a) a softening stage, wherein one or more sections of of 
low-quality wood are heated to a temperature in the range of from 

160 to 240 °C in the presence of an aqueous medium and at a 
pressure which is at least the equilibrium vapour pressure of said 

aqueous medium at the operating temperature, thereby at least 
partially hydrolysing the hemicellulose and disproportionating the 

lignin present in said wood, 
b) a dewatering stage, and 
c) a curing stage, characterised in that the softening stage is 
conducted in the presence of an aqueous pH buffer, having a pH in 

the range of from 3.5 to 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for upgrading low-quality 
wood to high-quality wood in an environmentally sound way, and to 
high-quality wood obtained by means of this process. Such a process 
is known from EP-A-0373726. According to this document a cellulosic fibrous aggregate is 
formed from a cellulosic fibrous material by a process which 
comprises: a softening stage comprising exposing a section of 
cellulosic fibrous material to the action of an aqueous softening 
agent at a temperature in the range of from 150 °C to 220 °C at a 
pressure of at least the equilibrium vapour pressure of the 
softening agent at the operating temperature, thereby at least 
partially disproportionating and hydrolysing the hemicellulose and 
lignin present in the cellulosic fibrous material; and a curing 
stage comprising drying the product of the softening stage at a 
temperature in the range of from 100 °C to 220 °C to yield a 
cross-linked cellulosic matrix. This document also suggests the 
inclusion of additives such as acids, alkali metal or earth alkali 
metal hydroxides or carbonates, ammonia or lower alcohols to 
facilitate softening. This process uses traditional ways of heating and drying the 
wood. These methods rely on thermal conduction to raise the 
temperature of the wood and evaporate water contained therein. The 
poor thermal conductivity of wood and the sensitivity of the 
process chemistry to extended heating times, result in limitations 
on product thickness and quality for such process. Furthermore, it 
has been found that gradients in temperature, pressure and moisture 
concentration induce stresses in wood, which may result in the 
formation of cracks and consequent loss of mechanical strength. 
Hence it can be concluded that there is need for a process for 
upgrading low-quality wood which allows the processing of sizable 
sections of low-quality wood. Surprisingly it has now been found that relatively large 
sections of low-quality wood can be upgraded to arrive at a final 
product which has good mechanical performance properties in  
 
addition to being moisture resistant, in a process wherein the 
aqueous medium, in the presence of which the softening of the 
low-quality wood is conducted, is pH buffered. Accordingly the invention relates to a process for upgrading 
low-quality wood to high-quality wood, comprising: 
a) a softening stage, wherein one or more sections of low-quality 
wood are heated to a temperature in the range of from 160 to 240 °C 
in the presence of an aqueous medium
