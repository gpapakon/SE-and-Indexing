<ABSTRACT>
A method of melting treatment of radioactive miscellaneous 
solid wastes containing therein an electrically 

conductive substance and other waste components. This 
method comprises charging the radioactive miscellaneous 

solid wastes into a cold crucible induction melting furnace 
provided with a high-frequency coil; supplying a high-frequency 

current to the high-frequency coil of the melting 
furnace to thereby heat and melt the electrically conductive 

substance, e.g. a metal, in the miscellaneous solid wastes; 
indirectly heating the other components in the miscellaneous 

solid wasted by utilizing the electrically conductive 
substance as a starting source of heating and melting; and 

placing the whole of the radioactive miscellaneous solid 
wastes into a molten state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of collective 
melting treatment of radioactive miscellaneous solid wastes, 
without classifying them, by using a cold crucible induction 
melting process, and more specifically, to a method capable 
of collectively reducing the volume of and solidifying 
various kinds of radioactive solid wastes, such as inflammables, 
metals, glasses and other nonflammables. Nuclear facilities or the like produce large amounts of 
radioactive miscellaneous solid wastes which contain in 
mixed form various kinds of substances, such as inflammables, 
metals, glasses and other nonflammables. Since such 
radioactive miscellaneous solid wastes have different radio-active 
levels or mixture ratios among various wastes-producing 
facilities, it is impossible to generally compare 
the radioactive miscellaneous solid wastes. However, in 
high-level solid wastes generated from reprocessing facilities, 
various substances are mixed, such as metals, woods, 
rags, etc. Although the mixture ratio differs with each 
operational condition, it is reasonably estimated that 
metals account for about 90% and the remainder consists of 
inflammables (rags or the like) and nonflammables (plastic 
sheets or the like).  
 For this reason, it is desired to develop an art capable 
of collectively and easily treating, i.e. volume-reducing 
and solidifying the radioactive miscellaneous solid wastes 
in which the waste components are not clearly classified and 
which exhibit various mixture ratios. A conventionally 
proposed method of melting treatment is a high-temperature 
melting method such as plasma melting. For example, WM'93-Technology 
and Programs for Radioactive Waste Management and 
Environmental Restoration, Vol 2, p1481: 'Waste Minimization 
with Plasma Processing' (Eschenbach etal) discloses a 
method of plasma processing in which waste fed into a sealed 
centrifuge with an axial, bottom port is heated by a 
transferred-arc plasma torch, whereupon a condensed phase 
accumulates as a glassy slag which may be cast into a mold. However, in such a conventional high-temperature melting 
art, molten matter makes direct contact with constituent 
materials of a melting furnace, e.g. refractory materials of 
furnace-wall or electrodes, under melting temperature conditions 
for a substance to be melted. Accordingly, a countermeasure 
against high-temperature erosion (allowance for 
erosion or replacement of constituent materials) and the 
limitation of a melting temperature (the upper limit is the 
temp
