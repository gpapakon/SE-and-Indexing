Method for the determination of small amounts of 
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides in oxygen-containing 

gas mixtures with the aid of a sensor whose electrical 
resistance changes at elevated temperature with the 

concentration of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, 
characterized in that (a) the resistance change caused by 

the sensor being in contact with the gas mixture to be 
analysed is measured at a first temperature T
1
 in a 
temperature range within which the resistance change 

caused by one of the two gases to be determined is 
considerable and that caused by the other of the two 

gases is comparatively small, and in this way the concentration 
of the one of the two gases is determined, (b) 

the resistance change due to said gas at the previously 
determined concentration is measured at a second temperature 

T
2
 in a temperature range within which both gases 
contribute to a considerable extent to the resistance 

change, (c) at said second temperature T
2
 the resistance 
change is measured which is caused by the gas mixture 

containing both gases to be determined, and (d) based on 
the difference of the resistance changes according to (b) 

and (c) the concentration of the other gas to be determined 
is obtained. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a sensor is used which is based on an n-type metal 

oxide which is doped with other metal oxides in such a 
way that the oxidation of the carbon monoxide to carbon 

dioxide proceeds at a reduced rate. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a sensor is used which is based on tin(IV) oxide  

 
which is doped with from 0.01 to 0.02 mol% of magnesium 

oxide, from 0.01 to 0.2 mol% of palladium oxide and from 
0.001 to 0.1 mol% of tantalum(V) oxide. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that in addition an inhibitor is employed by which the 

reaction 

CO + NO = CO
2
 + 1/2 N
2
 
is retarded.
