<ABSTRACT>
A calibration fixture for an MWD logging tool consists of a plurality of concentric co-planar conductive calibration loops (22, 24), mounted on a carrier disk of insulate material (16). The disk positions the calibration loops around the logging tool mandrel coaxially. The logging tool supports conventional transmitter(s) and receiver(s). The calibration loops are terminated with a multiple-tap impedance quantizer (34) for discretely varying the impedance of the calibration loops. When a transmitter is activated to emit an electromagnetic signal, the calibration loops are excited to re-radiate a portion of that signal into the receivers with an intensity that is a function of the loop impedance thereby to simulate the effects of formations having known resistivities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for calibrating an electromagnetic 
logging tool such as an induction logger,that is used to measure the conductivity of the 
surrounding formation while a borehole is being drilled therethrough. The apparatus is 
particularly useful as a secondary standard for field use in testing MWD loggers. Electromagnetic (induction) logging tools for measuring the electrical properties of 
subsurface earth formations are well known. The logging tool may be run into a borehole 
on a wireline after the hole has been drilled. Alternatively the tool may be incorporated 
into the lower end of the drill string, near the bit so as to log the formation parameters 
while the borehole is being drilled (i.e. Measurement While Drilling or MWD). The 
advantage of the latter method is that the tool can measure formation parameters before the 
borehole sidewall has become contaminated with the drilling fluids. Furthermore, the 
desired measurements are gathered in near real time rather than days or weeks later as is 
the case with wireline logging. Typical induction tools consist essentially of a transmitter coil and two receiver 
coils that are mounted concentrically on a mandrel. The two receiver coils may be 
separated by, perhaps, 30 cm and the transmitter coil may be about 0.7 m from the nearest 
receiver coil. In some tools, a second transmitter is provided at the opposite end of the 
receiver array. The respective coils commonly consist of several turns of wire of a suitable 
size that are insulated from the mandrel. An electronics module is incorporated into the 
tool to provide power to the transmitter coil and to detect the signals in the receiver coils. 
Means are furnished to either store the measured formation parameters or to transmit the 
gathered data to surface equipment, or both. At timed intervals such as every 100 milliseconds (ms), a 1- or 2-mHz sinusoidal 
signal at a potential of about 200 volts is launched into the transmitter coil. If two 
transmitter coils are provided, the transmitters are excited in alternate cycles and the 
received signals resulting alternate cycles are averaged. The electromagnetic field radiates  
 
outwardly from the transmitter, through the formation surrounding the borehole, to each 
of the receivers in turn. The received signals are very weak, on the order of 1 to 500 Âµv. 
The phase difference between the signals received by the respective receivers, as well as 
the amplitude ratio are parameters that are a function of the
