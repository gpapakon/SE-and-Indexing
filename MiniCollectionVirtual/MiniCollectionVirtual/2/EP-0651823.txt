<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for amplifying and detecting specific GC-rich nucleic acid sequences contained in a nucleic acid or in a mixture of nucleic acids, which includes treating a separate nucleic acid containing the specific sequence with a molar excess of primers and a polymerase and extending the primers in the presence of dATP, dCTP, TTP, and an analogue of dGTP. In one application of the present invention, individuals who are carriers for, or afflicted by, the fragile X syndrome are detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Fragile X PCRFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to methods for amplifying, detecting and cloning nucleic acid sequences, particularly to methods that are based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . It relates to a process for amplifying nucleic acid sequences in a test sample. One can also employ the present invention to determine whether a specific nucleic acid sequence is present in a test sample. More specifically, this invention relates to a process for amplifying a selected GC-rich nucleic acid sequence to facilitate detection and/or cloning of the sequence. The process of the present invention uses, in one embodiment, a thermostable polymerase to catalyze the extension of a primer bound to a template. The present invention also relates to the development of diagnostic assays for inherited or sporadic genetic defects. One application of the present invention provides an assay for the genetic defect that causes the fragile X syndrome in carriers, persons afflicted, fetuses and embryos.BACKGROUNDThe fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and developmental disability. This condition afflicts approximately 1 in 1250 males and 1 in 2000 females. 

As the name implies, fragile X is an X chromosome-linked condition. The fragile X phenotype is characterized by a visible constriction near the end of the X chromosome, at locus q27.3, and there is a tendency for the tip of the X-chromosome to break off under certain conditions in tissue culture. These tissue culture procedures form the basis of the assay most commonly used for fragile X at present.The pattern of inheritance of this condition is atypical of that associated with X-linked conditions. Typically, there is a 50% probability that the son of a woman who carries an X-linked genetic defect will be afflicted by the defect. Additionally, all males who carry the abnormal gene are afflicted by the X-linked condition in the typical pattern. Furthermore, since females have two X chromosomes, they normally do not suffer the effects of a single damaged X chromosome.In fragile X, however, some carrier males are phenotypically normal. Moreover, about one third of the females who inherit the fragile X chromosome are afflicted. The incidence of carrier males in different generations of a family varies. Daughters of carrier males are generally no -expressing carriers, but may have afflicted sons. Furthermore, afflicted daughters occur more frequently among the offspring of carrier mothers than among the
