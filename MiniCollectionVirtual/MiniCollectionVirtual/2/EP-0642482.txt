<ABSTRACT>
A process for separating a selected amino acid (enantiomer) from a mixture of different compounds including other amino acids is disclosed, in which process the mixture is contacted with a polymer material which is composed of cross-linked, amino-acid-based monomer units, said polymer material containing a molecular print of the selected amino acid. In the molecular print there is also bound a diastereomeric complex between the selected amino acid (enantiomer), a divalent metallic ion and the amino-acid-based monomer unit. Also the amino-acid-based monomer unit and a process for preparation thereof, as well as a polymer material composed of the amino-acid-based monomer unit and a process for the preparation thereof are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEPARATION OF AMINO ACIDS, AMINO-ACID-BASED MONOMER, AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF, AS WELL AS POLYMER MATERIAL AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOFThe present invention relates to a process for separat¬ ing amino acids, an amino-acid-based monomer, and a process for the preparation thereof, as well as a polymer material, and a process for the preparation thereof.Amino acids are structural elements of one of the most important types of molecule in nature, viz. proteins. It is most essential that amino acids of high purity are available, inter alia as the starting material in dif¬ ferent syntheses and as components in infusions.Moreover, most amino acids are chiral, and with few exceptions only one enantiomer is of interest. The access to efficient purification methods for amino acids is essential in order to prepare such compounds of high, especially optical, purity.Today a number of fundamentally different processes of purifying amino acids are available, both regarding the type of amino acid and the enantiomeric form. These processes may be divided into three main types: chemical, chromatographic and enzymatic. However, only a few of them are suitable for nonderivatised amino acids which are of main interest in industrial applications, since deriva- tisation of such relatively inexpensive fine chemicals is unrealistic from the economic point of view.The present invention relates to a new, preferably chromatographic, process of purifying nonderivatised amino acids.The molecular imprinting technique implies prepar¬ ing a synthetic polymer of desired affinity for a certain molecule 1'2 (the so-called print molecule). The polymer is composed of monomer units and intermediate cross-link- ing agents. The network contains a print of the print molecule. The preparation can be divided into three main steps, see Fig. 1. First there are formed chemical inter- 

 actions between the monomers (of the same or different chemical structures) and the print molecule in a selected solvent. These interactions may be both noncovalent and covalent. After adding cross-linking agents and an initiator, there is formed in the second step a polymer round the complex of monomer and print molecule. This results in a "mould" round the print molecule. The last step comprises extraction for removing the print molecule from the polymer, whereby an affinity seat remains in the polymer. This affinity seat is a molecular print of the print molecule in the polymer.The molecular print means that a form of adsorbtive "memory"
