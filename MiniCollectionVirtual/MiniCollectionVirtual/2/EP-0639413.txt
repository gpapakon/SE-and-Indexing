<ABSTRACT>
In a follow-up slotting tool for continuously punching 
workpiece (W) fed between a punch (3) and a die unit (5) at 

a predetermined pitch, the punch (3) is formed with a shear 
angle (α) at a lower end surface thereof in such a way that 

a front end of the punch is cut into the workpiece but a 
rear end thereof is not cut into the workpiece when lowered 

at a predetermined downward stroke; and the die unit (5) is 
provided with a counter member (15) for raising a residue 

(W
A
) partially cut away from the workpiece, after the punch 
has been lowered at the predetermined downward stroke, and 

with a cutting edge (21) for cutting off the partially cut 
away residue (W
A
) raised by the counter member in 
cooperation with the punch, when the punch is lowered at 

the succeeding predetermined downward stroke. The follow-up 
die can form an elongate slot, without forming any 

stepped portions at the junction portions of the workpiece, 
in spite of a relatively large pitch of the follow-up 

cutting processing of workpiece W.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a follow-up slotting 
tool 
according to the preamble of claim 1, 
suitable for use to form an elongate slot, for 
instance by punching off workpiece continuously and 
repeatedly by feeding plate material by a predetermine 
pitch. Here, the follow-up implies that a plurality of 
residues (punched-off parts of workpiece) are each cut 
partially and then completely away from workpiece 
continuously to form an elongate slot, without forming any 
stepped portions at the junction portions in the punched-off 
plate material. As the conventional follow-up slotting tools for 
continuously punching off workpiece located and shifted 
between a punch and a die to form an elongate slot, for 
instance, there have been so far known an elongated 
rectangular punch and a slotting tool (as disclosed in 
Japanese Published Unexamined Utility Model Application 
(Kokai) No. 2- 76621). In the case of the conventional 
elongated rectangular punch, however, since stepped (non-straight) 
portions are inevitably formed at the junction 
(overlap- punched) portions of the punched-off workpiece, 
whenever excellent external appearance is required for the 
punched-off products, it has been so far necessary of 
finish or eliminate the formed stepped portions with the 
use of a file, for instance.  
 Further, in the case of the conventional slotting 
tool, although no stepped portions are formed, since the 
slotting tool is provided with vertically movably tip and 
pin and a cam mechanism for driving the tip and pin, there 
exist problems in that the die mechanism is complicated; 
work feed pitch is small; and a long processing time is 
required. In addition, since there exists a limit of the 
cutting length punched off by the slotting tool, another 
problem arises in that the junction portions are inevitably 
formed at several positions of the workpiece in the case 
where a relatively long slot is required to be formed. A follow-up slotting tool according to the preamble of claim 1 
is disclosed for example by GB-A-2 197 814. With these problems in mind, therefore, it is the 
primary object of the present invention to provide a 
follow-up slotting tool which can punch off workpiece 
repeatedly and continuously to form an elongate slot for 
instance, without forming any stepped portions in the 
junction portions in the punched-off workpiece, in spite of 
a relatively large workpiece feeding pitch. To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present 
invention provides a follow- up slotting tool for

<CLAIMS>
A follow-up slotting tool for continuously punching 
workpieces (W) fed between a punch (3) and a die unit (5) at 

a predetermined pitch 
to form an elongate slot 

comprising a punch (3) 
formed with a shear angle (α) at a lower end surface 

thereof in such a way that a front end of the punch (3) is cut 
into the workpiece but a rear end thereof is not cut into 

the workpiece (W) when lowered at a predetermined downward 
stroke, characterized in that the die unit (5) is provi
ded with a 
counter member (15) for raising a residue (W
A
) partially 
cut away from the workpiece (W), after the punch (3) has been 

lowered at the predetermined downward stroke, and with a 
cutting edge (21) for cutting off the partially cut away 

residue (W
A
) raised by the counter member (15) in cooperation 
with the 

front end of the 
punch (3), when the punch (3) is lowered at the succeeding 

predetermined downward stroke. 
The follow-up slotting tool of claim 1, wherein at 
least one spring (19) is provided for urging the counter 

member (15) to raise the partially cut away residue (W
a
) so that 
the residue (W
a
) can be cut off from the workpiece (W) at the 
succeeding predetermined downward stroke. 
The follow-up slotting tool of claim 1, wherein the 
die unit (5) is composed of a die plate (27) formed with a 

die opening (27A); an upper die plate (11) arranged under 
the die plate (27) and formed with a rectangular opening (11A) 

corresponding to the die opening (27A) and with first and 
second openings (11B, 11C) both extending perpendicular to 

the rectangular opening (11A); and a lower die plate (9) 
for fixing both the counter member (15) loosely fitted to 

the first opening (11B) of the upper die plate (11) and the 
cutting edge (21) fixedly fitted to the second opening 

(11C) of the upper die plate (11), between the upper die plate 
(11) and the lower die plate (9), respectively.  

 
The follow-up slotting tool of claim 1, wherein the 
punch (3) is lowered to another predetermined downward stroke 

to cut off the final partially cut away residue (W
a
) from the 
workpiece (W) by the rear end of the punch (3) to complete a slot 

in the workpiece (W) by continuous punching processing. 
The follow-up slotting tool of claim 2, wherein the 
predetermined pitch is less than an already partially cut 

away workpiece length.
