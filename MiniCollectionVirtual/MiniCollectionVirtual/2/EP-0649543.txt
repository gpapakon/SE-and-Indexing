<ABSTRACT>
Many machines, particularly computers, execute decision processes during their operation. Such decision processes generally involve ascertaining the values of a number of condition factors and then determining the desired outcome in accordance with a predetermined decision function. This decision function may take the form of a number of individual statements relating condition-factor value combinations to particular outcomes. To facilitate end-user generation and modification of a decision function by generation and modification of a set of component statements, a structured representation for the component statements is presented to the user and statements are created and modified within this structured environment. Before a new or modified set of statements is accepted, it is checked for consistency between statements. Even where a conflict exists between statements, this may be permitted provided it is clear which statement is to have precedence, these being statements that form specific exceptions to more general statements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for facilitating the user-generation 
of a set of machine control statements used for controlling the operation of 
a machine such as a computer. Many machines, particularly computers, execute decision processes during their 
operation. Such decision processes generally involve ascertaining the values of a 
number of condition factors and then determining the desired outcome in accordance 
with a predetermined decision function. This decision function may take the form of 
a number of individual statements relating condition-factor value combinations to 
particular outcomes. Generally, such statements are either embedded in program code 
or set out in a knowledge base. In either case, the statements are contained in an 
environment which is forbidding to all except computer experts. Furthermore, even 
when a so-called "user-friendly" interface is provided to a knowledge base, anyone 
wishing to add or modify statements must comply with rigorous rules of syntax and 
logic in order to produce a consistent set of statements. As this will be well beyond 
the capabilities of untrained staff, the task of creating and maintaining decision 
functions based on a set of machine control statements has remained the responsibility 
of computer staff. Prior art of the type specified in the precharacterising parts of Claims 1 and 14 is known from Computer Journal, vol.28, no.4, 1985, pages 366-371. It is an object of the present invention to facilitate the generation and modification of 
a set of machine control statements that together constitute a decision function. In general terms, the present invention facilitates end-user generation and modification 
of a set of machine control statements by presenting these statements in a structured 
representation and by allowing the user to specify apparently contradictory statements 
provided that it is clear which statement is to have precedence according to the intuitive  
 
principle that a more specific statement has precedence over a more general one. More formally stated, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a method of facilitating user generation of a set of machine control statements 
that taken together constitute a decision function relating particular value combinations 
of a predetermined set of condition factors to corresponding particular outcomes of a 
set of such outcomes, each individual machine control statement associating a set of 
one or more condition-factor value

A method of facilitating user generation of a set of machine control statements 
that taken together constitute a decision function relating particular value combinations 

of a predetermined set of condition factors to corresponding particular outcomes of a 
set of such outcomes, each individual machine control statement associating a set of 

one or more condition-factor value combinations, herein CFVCs, with a said outcome; 
said method comprising the steps of: 


displaying to a user a structured representation for said machine control 
statements in which a said statement is represented in terms of a visual 

association between its CFVC set and corresponding outcome; 
receiving user input for creating at least one new machine control statement 
and/or modifying at least one existing machine control statement thereby to 

generate a new said set of machine control statements, said new and/or 
modified statement being represented in said structured representation; 
 
and being characterised by the step of automatically carrying out a consistency check on said new set of machine control statements 

by: 

(a) identifying any conflicts between statements by identifying any group of 
at least one CFVC which is common to a plurality of said statements 

that do not all specify the same outcome, 
(b) determining whether any such conflict is resolvable on the basis of a 
more specific statement having precedence over a more general one, by 

determining whether the corresponding said group is equal to the set of 
all the CFVCs encompassed by a said statement of said plurality, the 

presence of any such latter statement, herein an exception statement, 
determining said conflict to be resolvable with said exception statement 

being associated with any other said statement of said plurality such that 
the exception statement has precedence over said any other statement, 

and 
(c) inhibiting acceptance of said new set of statements where an 
unresolvable conflict is present. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said structured representation is a 

table arranged in rows and columns with the intersection of each row and column 
defining a cell, each said machine control statement being represented in the table by 

a said row/column and each said condition factor being associated with a respective 
column/row and said outcome with at least one column/row whereby the condition 

factor and outcome values associated with any particular said statement are specified 
in the corresponding cells of the said row/column representing that statement. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said structured representation is such 
as to constrain the CFVC set of a said new/modified statement to being within a subset 

of the set of all possible CFVCs whereby to limit the potential for conflict of said new/ 
modified statement to existing statements with a CFVC set within said subset. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said predetermined set of condition 
factors comprises at least two primary condition factors and said structured 

representation comprises at least one table representing a respective subset of all 
possible CFVCs of said primary condition factors which subset is free of overlap with 

a said subset represented by any other said table, said at least one table having rows 
and columns that serve to associate values of a pairing of said primary condition factors 

with said rows representing respective particular values of a first said primary condition 
factor of said pairing and said columns representing respective particular values of a 

second said primary condition factor of said pairing, the intersection of each row and 
column defining a cell, and each said machine control statement which has its CFVC 

set encompassed by said subset of a said at least one table and which is not an 
exception statement, being represented in the corresponding table by a respective said 

cell with the values of said first and second primary condition factors for that statement 
corresponding to the combination of condition factor values associated with the defining 

row and column of the cell and the outcome of that statement being specified in the cell 
itself. 
A method according to claim 4, wherein said structured representation 
comprises a plurality of said tables which can be individually selected for display.  

 
A method according to Claim 5, wherein said predetermined set of condition 
factors further comprises at least one secondary condition factor, the CFVC set of any 

said exception statement including both: 

a combination of values of said primary condition factors in respect of which 
a said cell and corresponding non-exception statement exist, and 
at least one value of at least one said secondary condition factor, 
the exception statement specifying a different outcome to said corresponding non-exception 

statement whereby it constitutes an exception to the latter. 
A method according to Claim 6, wherein the presence of said exception 
statement is indicated in the said table in which the corresponding said non-exception 

statement is represented by a user-discernible indication associated with the table cell 
representing the non-exception statement, the said method providing for user access to 

said exception statement by user identification of the cell concerned. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said 
consistency check is carried out upon user request following user input for creating at 

least one new/modified statement. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein upon said 
consistency check determining that a said unresolvable conflict is present, a visual 

indication of this conflict and of the identity of the conflicting statements is displayed 
to the user. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein a user can 
resolve an otherwise unresolvable conflict by designating a selected said statement as 

having precedence over any other statement with which it conflicts. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein upon said 
consistency check determining that a said unresolvable conflict is present, a proposal 

is presented to the user to enable a resolution of said conflict by using said conflict as 
the basis for one or more new exception statements.  

 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the user can 
modify said structured representation to add additional condition factors by selection 

from a list of such factors. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, further including the 
step of converting said machine control statements into a unified flattened tree structure 

for representing said decision function. 
Apparatus of facilitating user generation of a set of machine control statements 
that taken together constitute a decision function relating particular value combinations 

of a predetermined set of condition factors to corresponding particular outcomes of a 
set of such outcomes, each individual machine control statement associating a set of 

one or more condition-factor value combinations, herein CFVCs, with a said outcome; 
said apparatus comprising: 


means for storing said machine control statements; 
display means for displaying to a user a structured representation of said 
existing machine control statements in which a said statement is represented in 

terms of a visual association between its CFVC set and corresponding outcome; 
input means for receiving user input for creating a new machine control 
statement and/or for modifying at least one existing machine control statement 

thereby to generate a new said set of machine control statements, said new 
and/or modified statements being represented in said structured representation; 
 
and being characterised by conflict-checking means for automatically carrying out a consistency check on said new set 

of machine control statements by: 

(a) identifying any conflicts between statements by identifying any group of 
at least one CFVC which is common to a plurality of said statements 

that do not all specify the same outcome, 
(b) determining whether any such conflict is resolvable on the basis of a 
more specific statement having precedence over a more general one, by 

determining whether the corresponding said group is equal to the set of  
 

all the CFVCs encompassed by a said statement of said plurality, the 
presence of any such latter statement, herein an exception statement, 

determining said conflict to be resolvable with said exception statement 
being associated with any other said statement of said plurality such that
