and/or reproducing apparatus for recording and/or reproducing an
information signal on and/or from a recording disk such as an
optical disk, a magnetic disk, a magneto-optical disk or the
like. Such disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus is
composed of a disk rotating mechanism for holding and rotating
the above-mentioned recording disk and a pickup apparatus which
writes and/or reads the information signal on and/or from the
recording disk, being opposed to the above-mentioned
recording disk rotated by the disk rotating mechanism. If the
above-mentioned recording disk is the optical disk, then an
optical pickup apparatus is employed as the above-mentioned
pickup apparatus.Then, as the above-mentioned disk recording and/or
reproducing apparatus, there has been conventionally proposed
one arranged such that plural kinds of the recording discs 
having different diameters can be loaded thereonto and the
information signal can be recorded and/or reproduced by using
these recording discs selectively. As the plural kinds of the
recording discs having different diameters capable of being
loaded onto such disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus,
there are an optical audio disk having a large diameter (a
diameter of 12 cm), an optical audio disk having a small
diameter (a diameter of 8 cm) and so on. The disk recording
and/or reproducing apparatus is provided with a tray for
positioning and housing the above plurality of recording discs.The tray has a turntable which can be rotated. On an
upper surface portion of the turntable, housing portions formed
of a plurality of circular concave portions for positioning the
above respective recording discs are formed with being arranged
in the peripheral direction thereof. That is, on the upper
surface portion of the turntable, a plurality of large-diameter
housing portions corresponding to the optical audio disk having
the large diameter and small-diameter housing portions which
correspond to the optical audio disk having the small diameter
and are provided on bottom surface portions of the respective
large-diameter housing portions are concentrically formed with
using a rotation center axis of
