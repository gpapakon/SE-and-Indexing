<ABSTRACT>
An anchor pin (14) anchors one component upon 
another, such as an electrical connector (10) upon a 

printed circuit board (12), by way of a passage (40) 
defined by a mounting hole (138) in one of the components that 

is substantially aligned with an opening (18) in the other 
component. The anchor pin (14) has a first form (42) 

with a volume larger than the volume defined by the 
passage (40) while being receivable within the passage 

and a second form (44) in response to an external energy 
input, whereby the anchor pin (14) within the passage 

becomes fluid, deforming to substantially fill the 
passage (40), automatically accommodating any 

misalignment, and overflowing therefrom to form opposing 
heads (50, 50a). The mounting pin hardens in this form 

to anchor the components together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mechanical fasteners and 
has particular relevance to the mechanical fasteners 
used to attach an electrical connector to a substrate. The contacts of an electrical connector must be 
electrically connected to corresponding circuit pads on 
a substrate, for example a printed circuit board, in 
order to establish a circuit between the substrate and a 
mating device having a complementary connector. Typical 
contacts may have pads for surface mounting or pins for 
through-hole mounting to establish the electrical 
connection. Although these connections also have 
mechanical attributes, it is still necessary to 
mechanically anchor the connector to the substrate in 
order to prevent any force exerted on the connector 
during interconnection with a mating device from 
stressing the electrical interface and possibly damaging 
the electrical connection. During assembly, an electrical connector will be 
placed on the substrate by an assembly mechanism, such 
as a robot. This placement may be passive or, if high 
placement accuracy is required, active, possibly 
utilizing a vision system that registers the images of 
the contacts and the circuit pads. The housing of the 
electrical connector has a mounting hole that aligns 
with an opening in the substrate. A rivet, screw, pin, 
or other type of fastener mechanically anchors the 
connector housing to the substrate. However, due to manufacturing inaccuracies, the 
mounting hole and the corresponding opening may have 
slightly different configurations or be misaligned when 
the contacts are properly aligned with the circuit pads. 
To accommodate these inaccuracies, the fastener is 
typically made smaller than the mounting hole and/or the 
corresponding opening by an amount that assures 
insertion at the largest acceptable deviation. Use of  
 
the undersized fastener allows for relative movement 
between the connector housing and the substrate, 
resulting in stress being transferred to the contact-circuit 
pad interface during connection with the mating 
device. These stresses may be sufficient to damage the 
electrical connection at the interface, thereby 
preventing the desired circuit from being established. What is needed is an anchor pin that mechanically 
connects the connector housing to the substrate in a way 
that relative displacement between the two is prevented 
in spite of misalignment or other manufacturing 
inaccuracies, thereby protecting the electrical 
connection at the contact-circuit pad interface from 
stresses
