<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved rolls for metal shaping.
The rolls of the invention
have particular application in the hot rolling of metals,
such as of steel. However, it is to be understood that
the rolls of the invention also have application in the cold
rolling of steel and other metals, and as continuous casting
support rolls or thin strip caster work rolls.US 1493191 discloses a broad and open ended range of alloys
which may be used to manufacture a variety of products
including rolls; however, no working example concerning rolls
is provided.JP 04141553 discloses a composite roll for hot rolling
comprising an external layer which comprises 1.0-4.0 wt% of
carbon.Rolls, for the hot rolling of steel and other metals,
can be made from a wide variety of cast irons, cast steels and
forged steels. However, cast irons of the types considered below
have generally been used.In hot rolling, the temperature of feed material to be
rolled may reach 1000Â°C or more. The material of which the
rolls are made must be hard enough to resist wear, strong
enough to maintain dimensional shape and tough enough to resist
cracking and fracture. The material also must have sufficient
resistance to thermal shock in order to resist thermal
cracking, usually referred to as "fire cracking".Resistance to thermal shock is of paramount importance
in hot rolling at the high temperatures that are met in the
hot rolling of steel. The effect of such temperatures is particularly
severe in the event of a rolling mill stalling or
being stopped during a rolling pass, as the hot feed material 
then remains in contact with the stationary roll. With such
contact, conventional cast rolls will usually suffer severe
cracking, resulting in the need to remove the roll for
re -machining or in the roll being scrapped.Conventional alloy mottled cast irons, containing considerable
amounts of both carbides and graphite, are generally
used for the production of rolls for the rolling of hot metal,
particularly long steel products such as billets, bars, sections,
wires, rods and tubes. Typical of the mottled cast
irons used are nodular and indefinite chill irons. The mottled
cast irons are designed to combine a reasonable resistance to
both wear and thermal fatigue (thermal shock). However, a compromise
between 
these main properties is involved, since a change in the
balance between carbides and graphite will inevitably lead
to an improvement in one of the main properties at the
expense of the other. Thus, for example, nodular cast
irons with high
