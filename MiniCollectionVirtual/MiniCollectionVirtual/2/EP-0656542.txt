<ABSTRACT>
An impedance synthesizer includes an amplifier (16) 
with selectable gain and a reference capacitor (20), 

resistor (22), or inductor (24) for providing a plurality of 
synthesized impedance values. The voltage gain of the 

amplifier is controlled by a programmable multiplying 
digital-to-analog converter (30) which allows the selection 

of a myriad of desired synthesized impedances with 
high precision and accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the 
simulation of impedance using active circuits and in 
particular to an impedance synthesizer capable of 
synthesizing a wide range of precise resistance, 
capacitance, and inductance values. Calibrating electronic test and measurement 
equipment is commonly done by measuring a wide range 
of known impedance values with the equipment to be 
calibrated and adjusting the circuits in such 
equipment to precisely match the measured values. The 
known impedance values are provided by a variety of 
discrete reference components with known resistance, 
capacitance, and inductance values that are used as 
reference standards. Impedance is related to 
resistance, inductance, and capacitance as a function 
of frequency in the well known and accepted manner. 
During a calibration sequence, each reference 
component is individually measured by the instrument 
under calibration and the measured value is compared 
with the known value. Different instruments require 
different reference components. The result is a 
calibration method that is cumbersome because each 
discrete component must be handled separately,  
 
relatively inflexible because the number of component 
values on hand is limited and may not meet the needs 
of different calibration tasks, and expensive since 
reference components must be separately characterized 
and maintained. In accordance with the present invention, an 
impedance synthesizer provides a plurality of 
synthesized impedance values, thereby eliminating the 
need to utilize a myriad of separate or discrete 
components. An operational amplifier voltage gain is 
set precisely with a multiplying digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC). The multiplying DAC is digitally 
programmable via a parallel data bus which can be 
connected to a microprocessor or digital controller. 
The amplifier is configurable either for shunt mode or 
series mode depending on the type of impedance to be 
synthesized. A single reference capacitor, resistor, 
or inductor, selected by means of switches which also 
select the amplifier configuration, serves as the 
basis for synthesizing multiple component values based 
on the programmed gain setting of the operational 
amplifier. One feature of the invention is to provide 
synthesized impedance values across a pair of  
 
reference terminals. Another feature of the invention is the ability 
to synthesize multiple values of resistances, 
capacitances, and inductances over a wide range of 
values based on a single reference resistor,
