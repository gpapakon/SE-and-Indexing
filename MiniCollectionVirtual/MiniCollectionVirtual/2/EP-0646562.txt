<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst and process for the preparation of 2-butene-1,4-diol by hydrogenation of 2-butyne-1,4-diol in aqueous solution on a palladium-containing solid bed catalyst which is doped with lead or cadmium, a catalyst being used in which Pd and Pb or Pd and Cd are successively applied to a metal wire gauze or a metal foil as support by evaporation or sputtering and then a shaping of the catalyst has been carried out at elevated temperatures in air.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing butene-2-diol-1,4 by 
hydrogenating butyne-2-diol-1,4 in aqueous solution on a 

fixed-bed catalyst which contains palladium and is doped 
with lead or cadmium, wherein a catalyst is employed with 

which Pd and Pb or Pd and Cd have been applied 
successively by vapour deposition or sputtering onto a 

metal wire mesh or a metal foil as a support, followed by 
activation of the catalyst over a period from 0.5 to 2 

hours at from 200 to 800°C in air, and which, prior to 
use, has been reduced with hydrogen at temperatures of 20 

and 250°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein metallic 
supports of material numbers 1.4767, 1.4401 and 1.4301 

are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, prior 
to the active metals being applied, the supports are 

annealed in the air at temperatures of from 600 to 
1100°C, preferably from 700 to 1000°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein Pd in an 
amount of from 20 to 300 mg/m
2
, preferably from 40 to 
200 mg/m
2
, and then Pb in an amount of from 10 to 
60 mg/m
2
, preferably from 20 to 40 mg/m
2
 or Cd in an 
amount of from 10 to 50 mg/m
2
, preferably from 15 to 
30 mg/m
2
, are vapour-deposited or sputtered onto the 
support material. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
coated catalyst material is activated in air at 

temperatures of from 300 to 700°C over a period from 0.5 
to 2 hours. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the  
 

catalyst, prior to use, is reduced with hydrogen at 
temperatures of from 80 to 150°C. 
A catalyst in the form of metal gauzes or metal 
foils, prepared by first palladium and then lead or 

cadmium being applied to the support material by vapour 
deposition or sputtering, the coated support material 

then being heated at from 200 to 800°C over a period of 
from 0.5 to 2 hours in air and then being reduced with 

hydrogen at from 50 to 250°C. 
A catalyst as claimed in claim 7 in the form of 
metal gauzes or metal foils made of the materials having 

No. 1.4767, 1.4401 or 1.4301, to which successively first 
palladium in amounts of from 20 to 300 mg/m
2
 of surface 
area and then lead in an amount of from 10 to 60 mg/m
2
 
and/or cadmium in an amount of from 10 to 50 mg/m
2
 have 
been applied by vapour deposition or sputtering. 
A catalyst as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
metal gauzes or metal foils have been formed into monoliths 

by stamping and rolling.
