<ABSTRACT>
Methods and devices for medical use such as 
ostomy and wound healing having excellent chloride-free 

odor barrier properties are disclosed. It has 
been found that laminates incorporating ethylene 

vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymers are useful in 
providing an excellent barrier to odor and moisture 

without sacrificing softness and noise 
characteristics important to, for example, ostomy 

devices. The EVOH barrier is preferably between 
about 5-12% of the total laminate thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel methods 
for providing odor barriers in ostomy devices and is 
particularly concerned with such methods which 
utilize non-polyvinylidene chloride-based materials. There are a number of materials known to have 
significant gas barrier characteristics which are 
effective by providing resistance to gas and aroma 
permeation and transmission. Such materials include 
polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), including the vinyl 
chloride copolymer (PVDC-VC) and methacrylate 
copolymer (PVDC-MA) thereof, ethylene vinyl alcohol 
(EVOH) resins, nylon polymers including nylon 66 and 
nylon 66/6 10 copolymer, polypropylene and 
polyethylene terpthalate (PET). Also known are 
barrier composites including, but not limited to, 
glass-coated polyethylene terphthalate and two or 
three-component laminates including EVOH or PVDC. 
These barrier materials are used as packaging films, 
particularly in the food industry. PVDC and its copolymers have also been widely 
used as odor barrier materials in ostomy devices. In  
 
fact, PVDC-based barriers are the only materials from 
the above group which have thus far been found 
suitable for ostomy use. This is because the 
performance standards for use of odor barriers in 
ostomy devices, e.g., colostomy pouches, urostomy 
devices and the like, are significantly more 
stringent than for use in the packaging industries. 
First, as expected, the odors generated in an ostomy 
setting are of a substantially higher degree than 
found in, for example, the food industry. Also, the 
gas transmission rate of most of these non-PVDC 
barrier materials is adversely affected (i.e., 
increased) in high humidity environments such as the 
ostomy setting. Another medical area requiring odor 
barriers which can withstand high humidity is the 
wound care art where wounds of heavy exudate volume 
are a problem. Although it is known that barrier materials 
susceptible to humidity can be coextruded with 
polymers having low water vapor transmission rates, 
it must be noted that the barrier laminate is 
subjected to the high humidity in the ostomy and/or 
wound setting for a sustained period of time. If the 
barrier films or laminates are made thicker to resist 
the adverse effects of moisture the medical device 
becomes unacceptably noisy and suffers from loss of 
softness and pliability. Although PVDC-based barrier materials have 
been able to meet the stringent standards for ostomy 
use, it may prove desirable to have a "non-chloride-containing" 
alternative for
