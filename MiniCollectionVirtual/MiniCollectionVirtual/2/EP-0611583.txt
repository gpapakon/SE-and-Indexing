<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held programmer/monitor (500) for programming 
and monitoring an implantable tissue growth stimulator 

(10) is provided. The stimulator (10) includes circuitry 
(46) for implementing selected operations in response to 

a down-link signal transmitted by the programmer/monitor 
(500). The stimulator (10) also includes circuitry (14) 

for transmitting up-link signals to the 
programmer/monitor (500). The programmer/monitor (500) 

includes a control circuit (518) for generating the down-link 
signal. The control circuit (518) also processes 

the up-link signal to monitor the status of the 
implantable tissue growth stimulator (10). The 

programmer/monitor (500) also includes a transmit/receive 
circuit (514) for transmitting the down-link signal to 

and for receiving the up-link signal from the implantable 
tissue growth stimulator (10). The transmit/receive 

circuit (514) also couples the up-link signal to the 
control circuit (518).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to medical
devices, and more particularly to an implantable tissue
growth stimulator. Known tissue growth stimulators generally fall into
at least two broad categories. The first category
consists of implantable direct current ("DC") devices.
The generator of such stimulators are implanted in the
body near the site of tissue damage, a bone fracture or a
fusion. A cathode typically exits the case of the DC
stimulator leading directly to the injury site. The
stimulator case acts as the anode. Electronics within
the stimulator cause a direct current to flow between
cathode and anode and thereby through the tissue site
bone fracture or fusion site generally. A second class
of tissue growth stimulators are external or noninvasive
stimulators. These stimulators are aligned adjacent to a
tissue site, bone fracture or fusion site outside the
body. Typically, these devices generate either a pulsed
electromagnetic field ("PEMF") or a 60 Khz sinusoidal
electric field to promote healing at the injury site.
These subgroups of noninvasive stimulators are referred
to as PEMF and capacitive coupling stimulators.There are numerous disadvantages associated with
known direct current implantable tissue growth
stimulators. In general, the DC characteristics of these
stimulators require the leads to be routed directly to
the injury site. It is believed that the chemical change
at the cathode surface induces tissue growth.
Additionally, the cathode (or cathodes) is usually
embedded in the tissue, fracture or bone graft mass. It
may be required during explant of the stimulator that the
implanted cathode be left in the body. This may be
necessary after the tissue heals and encapsulates the
cathode originally implanted into the tissue mass. If
the cathode is damaged, or otherwise becomes inoperative,
extensive surgery will be required to replace it at the
tissue site. This increases the likelihood of surgical 
complications such as infection. Also, the DC stimulator
and its cathode will degrade imaging results due to their
proximity to relevant body structures. Imaging
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging,
computer-aided tomography and x-ray photography will all
be affected.External tissue growth stimulators also have
disadvantages associated with them. Because of their
placement outside the human body, these stimulators are
vulnerable from ambulatory or semiambulatory patients.
Their movement, whether intentional or inadvertent, may
cause damage to the unit. These devices are also
