<ABSTRACT>
Drive from an input member (12) is split. Part is transmitted mechanically through a housing (10) to an output member (14). The remainder powers a hydrostatic unit, e.g. a gear pump (32, 34) which may drive a fluid motor (50, 52) which gives a mechanical output which may also drive the output member (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
Continuously-variable hydromechanlcal parallel-type transmission device.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a hydro-mechanical device for the transmission of rotary motion or torque. 5 It particularly relates to a device permitting variation of the transmitted rotational speed. Background ArtA conventional variable hydro-mechanical gear system splits drive into two parts. One part of this drive is 0 then transmitted through a hydrostatic device to be recombined with the other part of the drive. Variation in control of the hydrostatic device controls the gear system. This invention simplifies and increases the efficiency of the gear system. 5 Disclosure of the InventionBroadly, the present invention concerns a transmission device in which an input is arranged to drive a hydrostatic (or hydraulic) unit directly and also to transmit drive mechanically through a housing. The 0 output from the device may be in two parts, one a reaction from the house, the other a reaction from the hydrostatic unit. These two reactions may be combined through one or more planetary gear systems to provide the output drive.25 In a preferred form, the input directly drives the hydrostatic unit housing. A reaction through a 

hydrostatic output drive shaft drives one torque path. The resistance of this torque path turns the hydrostatic unit, so driving the other output and providing a second torque path. It may include a gear pump in this form. The output from the unit is transmitted to a planetary gear system and combined with the output from the * irst torque path to provide the output drive from the unit. (Note: the designations "input" and "output" are essentially arbitrary. They relate to the usual mode of use, but the device may be used the other way round. )Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.
