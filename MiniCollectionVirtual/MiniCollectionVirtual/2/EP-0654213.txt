<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a composite plastic film and a greenhouse 
constructed by using the same as a covering sheet spread 

over a framework capable of exhibiting improved temperature 
elevation-suppressing effect in summer and improved warm-keeping 

effect in winter. The composite film has a double-layered 
structure consisting of a transparent or translucent 

thermoplastic resin film as the substrate and a transparent 
overlayer of a polymeric resin formed on one surface of 

the substrate film and these two layers are correlated each 
with the other in relation to two newly defined parameters 

including "the total heat volume", which is a product of the 
overall weight and the specific heat capacity of the film, 

and "the absorptivity of radiation heat" defined in terms of 
the decrease in the radiation temperature of sunlight by 

transmitting the film, the overlayer having the total heat 
volume not exceeding 10% of that of the substrate film and 

the absorptivity of radiation heat not exceeding 60% of that 
of the substrate film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite plastic 
film and a greenhouse built therewith as a light-transmitting 
covering sheet material such as disclosed in US-A-4250661. 
More particularly, the 
invention relates to a layered composite plastic 
film capable of exhibiting, when used as a covering sheet 
material of a greenhouse for plant growing, a very favorable 
effect for growing of plants that the decrease in the inside 
temperature of the greenhouse is relatively small in a 
winter season and the increase in the inside temperature 
of the greenhouse is not unduly large in a summer season 
without substantially decreasing the amount of insolation to 
the growing plants as well as a greenhouse built therewith. As is well known, it is a wide prevalence in the 
agriculture and horticulture that various kinds of crops 
including vegetables and floral plants as well as some fruit 
trees are grown under an artificially controlled climatic 
conditions in a greenhouse built with a framework and 
covered with a transparent or translucent plastic film 
spread on the framework in place of traditional glass panes. 
In some cases, so-called "tunnel growing" is practiced in 
which each ridge of the plant-growing field is covered with 
a tunnel-like shell made from a transparent or translucent 
plastic film supported by semicircular frames so as to 
protect the growing plants from direct influences of ambient 
conditions. A greenhouse should have an effect that, when 
the outside air temperature is low, for example, in winter, 
dissipation of the heat from inside to the outside of the 
greenhouse is prevented so as to moderate the temperature 
decrease in the greenhouse and, when the outside air temperature 
is too high, for example, in summer with a large 
amount of insolation, entering of the sunlight energy is 
decreased so as to facilitate growing of the plants. Various thermoplastic resins are conventionally used 
as the material for the above mentioned transparent or  
 
translucent plastic films as a covering material of greenhouses 
including polyvinyl chloride resins, polyolefin 
resins, polyacrylate resins and the like in the form of a 
single film, sheet or plate. A problem in a greenhouse 
built with these conventional plastic films or sheets is 
that the effect of temperature-modulation to be obtained 
in the greenhouse is not always high enough so that the 
artificially controlled climatic conditions are far from 
ideal for the growing of the plants. Accordingly, it is 
sometimes attempted to
