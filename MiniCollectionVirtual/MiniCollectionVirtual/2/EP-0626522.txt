<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a toggle fastener for fixing on hollow ceilings, which fastener is composed of a threaded rod (1), of a pivotable bracket (3) and of a fixing part (4). The fixing part (4) is designed as a truncated cone (8) with a retaining collar (6). The fixing part (4) has a longitudinal slot (11) which can be widened elastically to the diameter of the threaded rod (1). The fixing part (4) can thus be clipped laterally onto the threaded rod (1) and spread upwards against a ceiling (7), the truncated cone (8) being braced in the associated bore (9) of the ceiling (7).

Toggle plug for fixing to cavity ceilings, which has a retaining 
member (3) mounted on a threaded rod (1) and engaging in the cavity of a 

ceiling (7) and a fixing member (4) with a continuous bore (13) for fixing 
on the threaded rod (1), which fixing member is mounted on the threaded 

rod (1) and is arranged to be braced against the ceiling (7) from below, 
wherein an article to be mounted on the ceiling (7) is arranged to be fixed 

to the downwardly pointing threaded rod (1), characterized in that the fixing 
member (4) is a truncated cone (8) provided with a longitudinal slit (11), 

which longitudinal slit (11) opens at its base into the bore (13) and has a 
width that is smaller than the diameter of the threaded rod (1) and for 

snapping onto the threaded rod (1) is resiliently expandable to the diameter 
of the threaded rod (1), and the truncated cone (8) tapers at one end towards 

the retaining member (3) and at the other end has a supporting collar (6). 
A toggle plug according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
longitudinal slit (11) is widened towards the outer surface (21) of the fixing 

member (4). 
A toggle plug according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that at least one flat (15) is formed laterally on the supporting collar (6) or 

on an extension (14) lying opposite the truncated cone (8) and projecting 
downwards from the supporting collar (6). 
A toggle plug according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the supporting collar (6) or the extension (14) is in the 

form of a hexagon (16).  
 
A toggle plug according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the fixing member (4, 40) consists of plastics material 

and has a longitudinal groove (12) on the side lying opposite the 
longitudinal slit (11). 
A toggle plug according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the lower end of the threaded rod (1) continues as an 

integral ceiling hook (2). 
A toggle plug according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bore (13) is provided with longitudinally running 

ribs (22).
