<ABSTRACT>
A split mechanical seal, for mounting to a stationary housing that contains a 
rotating shaft, including first and second seal ring assemblies, at least one resilient biasing 

element and at least one axial biasing element. The first and second seal ring assemblies each 
include a seal ring having two segments that are resiliently supported in the seal. The 

segments have an outer surface and a pair of segment sealing faces disposed at opposite ends 
of the segments. The resilient biasing element is concentrically disposed about and in 

intimate contact with the outer surface of one of the seal rings, for applying a first radially 
inward force that biases the sealing faces of the seal ring segments into sealing contact with 

each other. The mechanical seal includes a pair of resilient biasing elements disposed about 
each seal ring, and the resilient biasing element is preferably an elastomeric member. The 

axial biasing element is associated with at least one seal ring for generating and applying, in 
cooperation with the elastomeric member, a second radially inward force; the second force 

operating to bias the segment sealing faces together when the mechanical seal is exposed to a 
selected pressure condition. The axial biasing element is an abutment, integrally formed with 

the segments of both seal rings, that has a radially outwardly slanted outer surface. When the 
mechanical seal is exposed to a selected pressure condition, the elastomeric member is 

disposed in intimate contact with the abutment, and applies an axial force thereto. The 
abutment transforms the axial force into an axial force component and a second radially 

inward force component. This second radially inward component also operates to bias the 
sealing faces of the seal ring segments into sealing contact with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to mechanical seals. More particularly, the
present invention relates to universal split mechanical seals that provide strong sealing
capabilities under different operating conditions.Split mechanical seals with resiliently mounted faces are employed in a wide
variety of mechanical apparatuses to provide a pressure-tight and fluid-tight seal. The
mechanical seal is usually positioned about a rotating shaft that is mounted in and protruding
from a stationary housing. The seal is usually bolted to the housing at the shaft exit, thus
preventing the loss of pressurized process fluid from the housing. Conventional split
mechanical seals include face type mechanical seals, which include a pair of sealing rings that
are concentrically disposed about the shaft, and axially spaced from each other. The sealing
rings each have sealing faces that are biased into sealing contact with each other. Usually,
one seal ring remains stationary, while the other ring contacts the shaft and rotates therewith.
The mechanical seal prevents leakage of the pressurized process fluid to the external
environment by biasing the seal ring sealing faces in sealing contact with each other. The
rotary seal ring is usually mounted in a holder assembly which is disposed in a chamber
formed by a gland assembly. The holder assembly has a pair of holder halves secured
together by a screw. Likewise, the gland assembly has a pair of gland halves also secured
together by a screw. The sealing rings are often divided into segments, each segment having
a pair of sealing faces, thereby resulting in each ring being a split ring that can be mounted
about the shaft without the necessity of freeing one end of the shaft ends.A drawback of the conventional split mechanical seal with resiliently mounted
faces is that the sealing capability of the seal rings degrades when the ambient pressure
becomes greater than the pressure of the process fluid. This degradation occurs since an
outward radial force develops on the seal rings, separating the split seal ring segments and
allowing pressurized fluid to escape to the external environment.Another drawback of conventional split seals is that the screws which secure
the gland and holder segments together are usually mounted in predetermined tapholes,
which typically necessitate rotating the shaft after securing one screw, to affix the other
screws. Additionally, during disassembly of the mechanical seal, the screws can become
disengaged from either segment of the gland and holder,
