<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general field
of surgical instruments and relates specifically to an
apparatus for delivering a vasoocclusion coil to a
selected site within a vessel (e.g., an aneurysm) via a
catheter.Vasoocclusion coils or wires are used to
occlude a site, such as an aneurysm, within a vessel.
The coils may be of a regular (e.g., helical)
configuration or assume a random convoluted configuration
at the site. Vasoocclusion coils are described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,994,069. The coils are normally made of a
radioopaque, biocompatible metal such as platinum, gold,
or tungsten. In treating aneurysms it is common to place
a plurality, typically 4 to 12, coils within the
aneurysm. The coils occlude the site by posing a
physical barrier to blood flow and by promoting thrombus
formation at the site.The coil(s) have typically been placed at the
desired site using a catheter and a pusher. The site is
first accessed by the catheter. In treating peripheral
or neural conditions requiring occlusion, the sites are
accessed with flexible, small diameter catheters such as
the catheters described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,739,768 
and 4,813,934. The catheter may be guided to the site
through the use of guidewires (see U.S. Patent No.
4,884,579) and/or flow-directed means such as balloons at
the distal end of the catheter. Once the site has been
accessed, the catheter lumen is cleared (i.e., the
guidewire is removed if a guidewire has been used), and
the coil is placed in the proximal end of the catheter
and advanced through the catheter with a pusher. Pushers
are wires having a distal end that is adapted to engage
and push the coil distally as the pusher is advanced
through the catheter. When the coil reaches the distal
end of the catheter it is plunged therefrom by the pusher
into the vessel. This technique of plunging the coil
from the distal end of the catheter has undesirable
limitations. First, because of the plunging action, the
positioning of the coil at the site cannot be controlled
to a fine degree of accuracy. Second, once plunged from
the catheter, it is difficult to reposition or retrieve
the coil if desired. Indeed, another device, called a
retriever, must be threaded through the catheter to snare
the coil to reposition or retrieve it.In view of these limitations, techniques have
recently been developed to enable more accurate placement
of coils within a vessel. In one technique (described in
WO-A-91/13592, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based)
the coil is bonded via a metal-to-metal joint
to

<CLAIMS>
A detachable pusher-vasooclusive coil assembly
for use in occluding a selected site within a vessel,

comprising in combination:

(a) a vasooclusive coil (13) having a proximal end
(15) and a distal end;
(b) a pusher (12) having a proximal end and a
distal end; and
(c) means (14, 21) carried coaxially about the
pusher (12) and coil (13) that is axially movable relative

to the pusher and coil;

   characterised in that:

the coil (13) carries an enlarged member (16) at its
proximal end;
the pusher (12) has a radial keyway (20) at its
distal end that receives the coil's enlarged member (16) in

interlocking engagement;
the means (14,21) is axially movable relative to the
pusher (12) and coil (13) from a first position, at which

the means encloses the member (16) interlocked within the
keyway (20) to maintain the member within the keyway, to a

second position, at which the means does not enclose the
interlocked member and radial keyway and the member is free

to withdraw from the radial keyway and thus uncouple the
pusher and coil; and
the enlarged member (16) is carried at the proximal
end of the coil (13) on either a proximal segment of the 

coil or the proximal end of a wire that extends proximally
from the coil, said segment or wire being normally biased

radially so that it will act to cause the enlarged member
(16) to move radially out of the keyway (20) when the means

(14,21) ceases to enclose the interlocked member and
keyway.
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the means is a
catheter (21).
The assembly of claim 1, wherein the means is a
sleeve (14) adapted to be received within a catheter (21).
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the enlarged member (16) is generally

spherical in shape.
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the pusher (12) has a cylindrical distal

tip (18).
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the keyway includes an axial slot extending

from the distal end of the pusher to the radial keyway
(20).
The assembly of any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the distal end of the pusher has an axial

bore (19) and the radial keyway (20) intersects the bore.
