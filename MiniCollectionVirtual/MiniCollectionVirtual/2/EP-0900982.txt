<ABSTRACT>
In gas turbine combustor constructed by combustion
chamber (10) and steam-cooled peripheral wall (2) thereof,

there is bored air hole (1) for injecting dilution air
therethrough in the peripheral wall (2) on upstream side of

the combustion chamber (10), thereby the air is supplied
through the air hole (1) into the vicinity of inner surface

of the peripheral wall (2) to form film flow of air and
increase of fuel concentration there is suppressed. The

dilution air is preferably supplied from gas turbine
compressor (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustor of gas
turbine, specifically to a combustor of which peripheral wall
is cooled by steam, e.g. as described in US Patent No 4 819 438 A.Fig. 3 is a constructional view of conventional gas
turbine plant. In Fig. 3, numeral 6 designates a compressor,
numeral 7 designates a combustor, numeral 8 designates a gas
turbine connected to the compressor 6 coaxially and numeral 9
designates an exhaust gas boiler for recovering energy of
exhaust gas after used for driving the gas turbine 8.In operation of the gas turbine plant constructed as
mentioned above, combustion air which has been compressed by
the compressor 6 driven coaxially with the gas turbine 8 is led
into the combustor 7. In the combustor 7, fuel is injected for
combustion into the combustion air so compressed as above.
Combustion gas therefrom is led into the gas turbine 8 for
expansion work and then is led into the exhaust gas boiler 9.
It is to be noted that, although not shown in the figure, a
generator is connected to an output shaft of the gas turbine 
8 to be driven by the gas turbine 8.In the exhaust gas boiler 9, water is heated by the
exhaust gas sent from the gas turbine 8 to generate steam. This
steam is led into a steam turbine (not shown) for drive thereof.
Also, a portion of the steam is led into the combustor 7 as a
cooling steam to be used for cooling of a peripheral wall of
the combustor 7.Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of main part of one
example of a prior art combustor, in which a peripheral wall
of the combustor is cooled by cooling steam. In Fig. 4, a combustor
7 of a steam-cooled system is a combustor for generating a
combustion gas of high temperature of about 1,500Â°C at gas
turbine inlet. Numeral 2 designates a peripheral wall, which
is a steam-cooled wall constructed such that steam flows in the
wall for cooling of wall surface, said steam having been
generated at the exhaust gas boiler 9 to do expansion work at
a steam turbine (not shown) and thus temperature-reduced to a
certain level to be used as a cooling steam.Numeral 10 designates a combustion chamber, which is
surrounded by the peripheral wall 2 and constructed such that
a combustion air from the compressor 6 is led thereinto through
a wall portion 20 on an upstream side thereof. Also, in the
wall portion 20 on the upstream side of the combustion chamber
10, there is provided a pilot nozzle 4 at a central portion
thereof and also provided are a plurality of main nozzles 3, 
arranged with equal intervals along a
