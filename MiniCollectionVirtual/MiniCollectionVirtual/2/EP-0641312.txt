<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having the formula R-(CH2)m-CO-R' wherein R is a 5 to 7 member carbocyclic system or an 8 to 11 member carbobicyclic system or any such system substituted with one or more of F, Cl, Br, OH, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkoxy, CF3, phenyl, amino, C1 to C4 alkylamino and di(C1 to C4 alkyl)amino; m is 0 or 1; R' is -[NH(CH2)n]xNH2; each n is independently 2 to 5; and x is 1 to 6, and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are potent excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter antagonists. These compounds are useful as mammalian psychotherapeutants, as the active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions for treating conditions in mammals which are mediated by excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters and in the control of invertebrate pests.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHETIC ARYL POLYAMINES AS EΞXCITATORY AMINO ACID NEUROTRANSMITTER ANTAGONISTSBackground of the Invention This invention relates to a class of aryl polyamines and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are antagonists of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters affect neuronal cells of a variety of organisms including invertebrates and vertebrates. The polyamines of the present invention are synthetic analogs of certain polyamines found to be present in the venom of the Aαelenopsis aperta spider. This invention also relates to the use of such polyamines and their salts in antagonizing excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters affect cells such as cells in the nervous system of an organism. This invention further relates to the use of such polyamines and their salts in the treatment of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter- mediated diseases and conditions in a mammal, in control of invertebrate pests, and to compositions comprising said polyamines and salts thereof. This invention also relates to methods of producing such polyamines.It has been reported that the venom of the spider Aαelenopsis aperta contains at least two toxins which affect calcium currents. Jackson, H., et al., Soc. Neu. Sci. Abstr. 12:1078 (1987). Those authors disclose a toxin, referred to therein as AG2, which has a molecular weight of less than 1 ,000 daltons and appears to suppress calcium currents in a broad range of tissues. Further, Jackson, H. et al., Soc. Neu. Sci. Abstr. 12:730 (1986) report another toxin from Aqelenopsis aperta comprising a component of about 6,000 M.W. That toxin is reported to block presynaptic transmission and it has been suggested that the toxin blocks calcium channels associated with the release of neurotransmi tter. 

 Certain polyamines found to be present in the venom of the Aqelenopsis aperta spider are disclosed in U.S. patent no. 5,037,846, filed April 28, 1989 and assigned to the assignees hereof. Those polyamines and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are disclosed therein as blockers of excitatory amino acid receptors in cells and one such polyamine, B therein, is also disclosed as a blocker of calcium channels.Compounds which are excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter antagonists have a variety of utilities. Excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter antagonists are useful in the treatment of such conditions as stroke, cerebral ischemia, neuronal degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy and as
