<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a printed
circuit board, more specifically to a process for preparing
a printed circuit board, in which a circuit pattern is
formed by electroless plating by using a photoresist.In the prior art, a printed circuit board has been prepared
mainly by a subtractive process in which a through-hole is
formed by using electroless thin copper plating and
electrolytic copper plating in combination and a circuit
(wiring) pattern portion is formed by etching. On the
other hand, an additive process in which a through-hole and
a circuit pattern portion are formed by electroless copper
plating has been put to practical use. The additive
process is suitable for a fine circuit and a through-hole
with a small diameter so that attention has been paid
thereto as a process for preparing a high-density printed
circuit board to be used in the future.In the additive process, a resist for electroless copper
plating which can stand in an electroless plating solution
having high alkalinity (generally pH 11 to 13.5) and high
temperature (generally 60 to 80 °C) for a long period of 
time (generally 4 to 50 hours) is required, and it is
difficult to form a fine circuit with each of a line width
and a distance between lines being 150 µm by a resist for
screen printing so that a photoresist is generally
required.Photoresists for the additive process have been proposed in
Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 43468/1975,
No. 770/1979, No. 100490/1983, No. 199341/1983, No. 12434/1984
and No. 101532/1985. A photoresist having excellent
mass productivity by which an electroless copper plating
solution is less contaminated has been proposed in Japanese
Provisional Patent Publication No. 18692/1988. However, as
to all of these proposed photoresists, an organic solvent
such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane is used in a developing solution
so that there are problems in working environment and
a processing cost. Further, use of a halogen-containing
organic solvent tends to be limited because of a recent
problem of environmental pollution. Thus, there has been
demanded a process for preparing a printed circuit board by
a photoresist by using a developing solution which ensures
good working environment and does not cause a problem of
environmental pollution even in the additive process, i.e.,
a developing solution using no halogen-containing organic
solvent.As a photoresist for electroless plating which can be
developed with an alkaline aqueous solution, there has been
disclosed an alkaline
