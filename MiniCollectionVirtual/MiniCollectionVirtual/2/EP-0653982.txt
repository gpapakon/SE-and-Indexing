<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a polyester container having an enhanced level of crystallinity in the sidewall (18) while maintaining a low level of crystallinity in a thickened base portion (26). The container is particularly useful as a refillable container which can withstand higher caustic wash temperatures and exhibits reduced flavor carryover, or as a hot-fill container. According to the method, a sidewall-forming section of a preform is initially expanded, heated to contract and crystallize the same, and then reexpanded; a base-forming portion of the preform is shielded from the heat treatment and is expanded either before or after the heat treatment step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of making a container having enhanced sidewall crystallinity and low base crystallinity
according to the precharacterising part of claim 1 and claim 26 respectively.
The container is particularly adapted for use as a refillable
carbonated beverage container able to withstand higher caustic wash temperatures and exhibit reduced product flavor
carryover, or as a hot fill container.The market for PET refillable carbonated soft drink (CSD) bottles has enjoyed significant growth worldwide since
its introduction in 1987 by Continental PET Technologies. These bottles have been commercialized throughout much of
Europe, Central and South America, and are now moving into the Far East market.Refillable bottles reduce the existing landfill and recycle problems associated with disposable plastic beverage bottles.
In addition, a refillable bottle provides a safer, lighter-weight plastic container in those markets, currently dominated
by glass, where legislation prohibits use of non-returnable packages. The goal is to produce a refillable bottle having
the necessary physical characteristics to withstand numerous refill cycles, and which is still economical to produce.Generally, a refillable plastic bottle must maintain its functional and aesthetic features over a minimum of 10 and
preferably over 20 cycles or loops to be considered economically feasible. A loop is comprised of (1) an empty hot caustic
wash followed by (2) contaminant inspection and product filling/capping, (3) warehouse storage, (4) distribution to
wholesale and retail locations and (5) purchase, use and empty storage by the consumer followed by eventual return to
the bottler. This cycle is illustrated in FIG. 1. In an alternative cycle, the contaminant inspection occurs prior to the caustic
wash.Refillable containers must meet several key performance criteria to achieve commercial viability, including:
1. high clarity (transparency) to permit on-line visual inspection;2. dimensional stability over the life of the container; and3. resistance to caustic wash induced stress cracking and leakage.A commercially successful PET refillable CSD container is presently being distributed by The Coca-Cola Company
in Europe (hereinafter "the prior art container"). This container is formed of a single layer of a polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) copolymer having 3-5% comonomer, such as 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) or isophthalic acid (IPA). The
preform, from which this bottle is stretch blow molded, has a sidewall thickness on
