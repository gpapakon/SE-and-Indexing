<ABSTRACT>
The thermal print head mounting comprises a first arm (1) which is mounted at its one end so as to be pivotable about a first axle (10) and at whose other end a thermal print head (2) is arranged, which rests on a back pressure roller (4) under the force of at least one spring (13). In order that the thermal print head rests on the recording medium with sufficiently high pressing-on force to achieve a good printing quality and can nevertheless be pivoted away from the back pressure roller and/or the recording medium resting on it in a simple manner using an inexpensive drive device of relatively low power, a second arm (15) is provided, which can be set in pivoting motion by means of a drive device (16) engaging at its one end, is mounted near to its other end so as to be pivotable on a second axle (17), and is mechanically connected at its other end to the other end of the first arm (1).

A thermal print head mounting structure, comprising a first arm 
(1) having its one end pivotally mounted on a first axle (10) while its other 

end carries a thermal print head (2) which is held in engagement with a 
platen roll (4) by the force of at least one spring (13), 
characterized by
 a 
second arm (15) adapted to perform pivotal movements caused by a driving 

mechanism (16) acting upon the one end of the second arm, while an area 
proximal to the other end of the second arm is pivotally mounted on a 

second axle (17) the other end being mechanically connected with the other 
end of the first arm (1) so that a pivotal movement of the second arm (15) in 

the one direction enables the thermal print head (2) to be moved out of its 
engagement with the platen roll (4) in opposition to the force of the at least 

one spring (13) while a pivotal movement of the second arm (15) in the 
opposite direction enables the thermal print head (2) to be moved into 

engagement with the platen roll (4). 
The thermal print head mounting structure as claimed in claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the at least one spring (13) bears with its one end 
against the first arm (1) and with its other end against the one end of a stop 

arm (12) which has its other end pivotally mounted on the first axle (10) and 
which, in particular in operation of the printer, is adapted to be fixedly held in 

a pivot position by means of a locking device (19), in which position its one 
end provides the abutment for the at least one spring (13).  

 
The thermal print head mounting structure as claimed in any 
one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the driving mechanism (16) 
acting upon the one end of the second arm (15) is a motor-powered rotary 

disk (29) including a pin (30) which is disposed eccentrically on the disk and 
engages within a longitudinal slot (31) provided in the one end of the second 

arm (15) and extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the second arm.
