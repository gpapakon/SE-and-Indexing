<ABSTRACT>
The improved packaging material having oxygen barrier 
quality has a thin layer of inorganic substance formed on a 

layer of resin composition having oxygen barrier quality that 

comprises at least a thermoplastic resin and an oxidation 
catalyst. The packaging material is inexpensive, can be 

processed efficiently and it yet develops high oxygen barrier 
quality right after processing and maintains it for a 

prolonged period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging materials having 
oxygen barrier quality. Packaging materials in current use are mostly made of 
polymers that can be easily processed into various shapes such 
as films, sheets, bottles and vessels and which are also 
lightweight to permit transportation at low cost. When the materials to be packed are food and other 
substances that are prone to deteriorate by oxidation, 
packaging materials are required to have particularly high 
oxygen barrier quality. To meet this need, polymers of high 
oxygen barrier quality such as the saponification product of 
an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVOH) and polyvinylidene 
chloride, as well as films with evaporated coatings of 
aluminum or silicon oxides have been used. However, the 
polymers having high oxygen barrier quality have been too 
expensive to be commercialized. In addition, EVOH has the 
problem that its oxygen barrier quality decreases upon 
moisture absorption. The films with evaporated coats suffer  
 
the disadvantage that pinholes or cracks will prevent them 
from exhibiting the intended oxygen barrier quality in a 
consistent manner. The present inventors previously filed a Japanese patent 
application (now published as Unexamined Published Japanese 
Patent Application Hei 4-213346) and proposed a polyolefinic 
resin composition that dispensed with costly resins having 
oxygen barrier quality by using a polyolefin and an oxidation 
catalyst and which yet would exhibit satisfactory oxygen 
barrier quality over time. However, this polyolefinic resin 
composition which is intended to exhibit oxygen barrier 
quality over time has had the problem that if it is rendered as 
a film with a thickness of 100 Âµm and less, the intended oxygen 
barrier quality is not fully exhibited right after processing 
into the film. The present invention has been accomplished under these 
circumstances and has as an object providing a packaging 
material that is inexpensive, that can be processed 
efficiently and which yet develops high oxygen barrier quality 
right after processing and maintains it for a prolonged period  
 
of time. This object can be attained by a packaging material 
having oxygen barrier quality that has a thin layer of 
inorganic substance formed on a layer of resin composition 
having oxygen barrier quality that comprises at least a 
thermoplastic resin and an oxidation catalyst. Fig. 1 is a partial section of a packaging material having 
oxygen barrier quality according to a first embodiment of the 
invention;
