<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container, and in particular to a hand held container for
storing compact discs.Containers currently being used to store compact discs can be difficult to open.
Young children with small hands find it particularly difficult to apply the necessary
force to open these types of containers. The present invention seeks to provide a
container which can both safely store objects such as compact discs and which can
easily be opened. DE-A-30 08 513 discloses a container having the features of the precharacterising
part of claim 1.The present invention provides a hand held disc container as set forth in claim 1.Preferred embodiments are set forth in the dependent claims 2 to 6. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only with
reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a container according to a first embodiment of the
invention showing a compact disc stored within the container;Figure 2 is an assembly view of the container shown in Figure 1;Figure 3 is a top view of the container shown in Figure 1 illustrating a compact disc
being ejected from the container;Figure 4 is an end view of the container shown in Figure 3.Figure 5 is an assembly view of a container according to a second embodiment of the
invention; andFigure 6 is a top view of the container shown in Figure 5 illustrating a compact disc
being ejected from the container.Figure 1 illustrates a square container 10 which is made of a clear plastics material.
The container 10 has top and bottom walls 12, 14 and first and second pairs of
opposed side walls 16, 18. The container 10 is formed with a recess 20 or cavity having a
mouth 22 or slot which opens through side wall 18a. Recess 20 is arranged to receive an
object such as a compact disc 50.A track 30 extends along each of the side walls 16 of the container 10. The
longitudinal mouth of each track 30 opens into the recess 20. Each track 30 is 
arranged to receive a portion of the peripheral edge 52 of the compact disc 50 when
it is received in the container 10. In this way, the area of the side faces of the
compact disc 50 which must be preserved in order to ensure sound quality is
prevented from coming into contact with either of the top and bottom walls 12, 14
of the container 10. The engagement of the peripheral edge 52 of the compact disc
50 in the tracks 30 is best illustrated in Figure 4.An ejector 40 comprising an arm member 42, a web 43 and a trigger 44 is mounted
in the container 10. Web 43
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hand held disc container comprising a flat generally rectangular box defining a disc-containing
cavity (20; 107) adapted snugly to receive opposed edge portions of the disc, a slot

(22; 112) in one edge of the box communicating with the cavity (20; 107) and through which
the disc can be inserted and removed from the box in edgewise fashion, and manually

operable disc ejector means (40; 118) mounted to engage an edge portion of the disc to
displace the disc at least partially from the cavity (20; 107), the disc ejector means (40; 118)

comprising an arm (42; 120) extending into the rear of the cavity (20; 107) for engaging the
disc and a portion (44; 124) extending externally of the box and adapted for manual actuation

by an operator, characterised in that the arm (42; 120) has a curvature corresponding to the
curvature of the disc and a groove (42C; 120C) extending along the arm (42; 120) and facing

towards the slot (22; 112), the groove (42C; 120C) receiving and supporting the peripheral
edge portion of the disc at the rear of the disc to prevent axial displacement thereof, and

opposed tracks (30; 114A, 114B, 116A, 116B) are formed within the box along opposite sides
of the cavity (20; 107) to prevent axial displacement of the disc within the cavity, said groove

(42C; 120C) and tracks (30; 114A, 114B, 116A, 116B) preventing contact between the faces
of the disc and the opposed walls of the cavity (20; 107).
A container according to claim 1, characterised in that the arm (42; 120) and manually
actuable portion (44; 124) of the ejector means are integrally formed, the ejector means is

mounted for pivotal movement, and the manually actuable portion (44; 124) constitutes a
manually-operable trigger.
A container according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the groove (42C;
120C) in the arm (42; 120) is tapered in cross-section.
A container according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised by means adjacent
the slot (22; 112) to wipe a face of the disc as it enters and exits the cavity. 
A container according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that each of said
tracks (114A, 114B, 116A, 116B) has a section (116A, 116B) of arcuate shape having a

curvature corresponding to the curvature of the disc, each said arcuate track section (116A,
116B) being resilient at a forward end portion closest to the slot (112) whereby ejection and

insertion of the disc causes the forward end portions of the arcuate track sections to be
resiliently deflected from a curved configuration conforming to the periphery of the disc to

an outer configuration which permits passage of the disc, said deflectable forward end
portions of the arcuate track sections returning to the disc-conforming configuration after

passage of the disc.
A container according to claim 5, characterised in that during insertion of the disc the
return movement of the deflectable forward end portions of the arcuate track sections (116A,

116B) to the disc conforming configuration acts to push the disc fully into the cavity (107)
and to retain the disc within the cavity against accidental discharge.
