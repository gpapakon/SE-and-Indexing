<ABSTRACT>
An easily removable vehicle seat (12) is 
provided for use with a vehicle including a floor (14) 

having an upwardly facing surface (24). The floor 
includes front and rear wells (26,28) extending below the 

upwardly facing surface, and anchor members (36) extending 
across the wells. The vehicle seat (12) includes a rigid 

support structure (50) having a downwardly facing surface 
for engaging the anchor members (36,37) of the vehicle 

floor. A cushioned seat structure is (52,54) provided on 
the rigid support structure (50). The vehicle seat also 

includes hook members (40,42) mounted on the rigid support 
structure (50) for movement between (A) an operative 

position extending below the downwardly facing 
surface so as to enter the wells (28,28) and engage in 

hooked relationship with the anchor members (36,37) and (B) 
an inoperative position disposed above the operative 

position thereof so as to enable the rigid support 
structure (50) to be moved relatively over the floor. 

Wheels (46,47) are mounted on said rigid support structure 

(50) for movement between (A) an operative position 
extending below the downwardly facing surface of the 

rigid support structure (50) and so as to enable the 
rigid support structure (50) to be rolled over the 

upwardly facing surface (24) of the vehicle floor and (B) 
an inoperative position disposed above the operative 

position thereof. The vehicle seat (12) further includes 
a mechanism (49) for moving the hook members (40,42) into 

the operative position thereof and the wheels (46,47) into 
the inoperative position thereof and for moving the hook 

members (40,42) into the inoperative position thereof and 
the wheels (46,47) into the operative position thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle seat
support assembly for removable vehicle seats, and in
particular to easily removable vehicle seats which
may be securely latched to the floor of the vehicle
in an operative position and then released from the
operative position and rolled to, and removed from,
the opening of the vehicle.Conventional removable vehicle seats
include a seat cushion mounted to a riser assembly
which provides the proper seat cushion height for
optimal occupant comfort. Conventional riser
assemblies for such seats provide a method of
retaining the seat to the floor of the vehicle by
means of a latch or a lock. Removal of the seat is
achieved by unlatching the seat from the floor, then
lifting and carrying the seat out of the vehicle to
a place of storage. Typically, such seats must be
removed when vehicle cargo space is required then
reinstalled when passenger seating is needed.
Lifting the vehicle seat to the opening of the
vehicle and then from the vehicle to the storage
area can be quite burdensome for the individual
performing this task. Occasionally, when the
vehicle seat is quite heavy, the seat is dragged
across the floor of the vehicle and then removed
from the vehicle opening causing damage to the
interior of the vehicle or to the latching elements
of the seat.A need therefore exists to provide an
easily removable vehicle seat which may be securely
latched to the floor of the vehicle in an operative
position and rolled to the opening of the vehicle
while the latches are disposed in an inoperative 
position so as to minimise lifting of the seat upon
removal.EP-A-0215495 discloses a movable seat system for
aircraft in which feet on the seat are received in tracks
in the aircraft, the seat having wheels to assist movement
of the seat.According to the present invention there is provided a
support assembly for supporting a vehicle seat in a
vehicle, the support assembly comprising a rigid support
structure for supporting a vehicle seat and having
downwardly facing surface means for engaging anchor members
of a vehicle floor means, front and rear hook members
mounted on said rigid support structure, and wheel members
mounted on said rigid support structure,
   characterised by:
said front and rear hook members being mounted on said
rigid support structure for movement relative thereto
between (A) an operative position extending below the
downwardly facing surface means so as to engage in hooked
relationship with the anchor members so as to detachably
fixedly retain the rigid support
