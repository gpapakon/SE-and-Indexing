<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modified
vaccinia virus and to methods of making and using the same.
More in particular, the invention relates to recombinant
vaccinia virus, which virus expresses gene products of a
Marek's disease virus (MDV) gene, and to vaccines which
provide protective immunity against MDV infections.Several publications are referenced in this
application. Full citation to these references is found
at the end of the specification immediately preceding the
claims. These references describe the state-of-the-art
to which this invention pertains.Vaccinia virus and more recently other
poxviruses have been used for the insertion and
expression of foreign genes. The basic technique of
inserting foreign genes into live infectious poxvirus
involves recombination between pox DNA sequences flanking
a foreign genetic element in a donor plasmid and
homologous sequences present in the rescuing poxvirus
(Piccini et al., 1987).Specifically, the recombinant poxviruses are
constructed in two steps known in the art and analogous
to the methods for creating synthetic recombinants of the
vaccinia virus described in U.S. Patent No. 4,603,112,
the disclosure of which patent is incorporated herein by
reference.First, the DNA gene sequence to be inserted
into the virus, particularly an open reading frame from a
non-pox source, is placed into an E. coli plasmid
construct into which DNA homologous to a section of DNA
of the poxvirus has been inserted. Separately, the DNA
gene sequence to be inserted is ligated to a promoter.
The promoter-gene linkage is positioned in the plasmid
construct so that the promoter-gene linkage is flanked on
both ends by DNA homologous to a DNA sequence flanking a 
region of pox DNA containing a nonessential locus. The
resulting plasmid construct is then amplified by growth
within E. coli bacteria (Clewell, 1972) and isolated
(Clewell et al., 1969; Maniatis et al., 1982).Second, the isolated plasmid containing the DNA
gene sequence to be inserted is transfected into a cell
culture, e.g. chick embryo fibroblasts, along with the
poxvirus. Recombination between homologous pox DNA in
the plasmid and the viral genome respectively gives a
poxvirus modified by the presence, in a nonessential
region of its genome, of foreign DNA sequences. The term
"foreign" DNA designates exogenous DNA, particularly DNA
from a non-pox source, that codes for gene products not
ordinarily produced by the genome into which the
exogenous DNA is placed.Genetic recombination is in general the
exchange of
