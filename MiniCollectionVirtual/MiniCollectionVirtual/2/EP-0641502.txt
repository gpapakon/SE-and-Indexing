<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to analog to digital (A/D)
conversion and more particularly to a muliplexed oversampled analog to
digital modulator suitable for processing an array of analog inputs, as for
example, in a optical imager, to produce a digital output.Present approaches in focal-plane video imaging systems use some
form of analog mutiplexing of the pixel data in order to read the image
information. It is this multiplexing which defines the so called video data
rates. In broadcast television, for example, the 30 hertz pixel data rate is
multiplexed to the 4 megahertz video data rate. This same situation exists
in industrial and military video systems where pixel rates are usually
below 3 kilohertz and analog multiplexing is used with resulting megahertz
video rates.These multiplexing approaches have necessitated the use of analog to
digital conversion processes employing high speed circuitry which, as a
practical matter cannot be readily integrated with a focal-plane sensor.
Moreover, the typical A/D converter in these applications comprises a
high-speed video, flash converter which is generally considered too
expensive for use in consumer applications.As is discussed in Oversampling Delta-Sigma Data Converters, edited
by James C. Candy and Gabor C. Temes, IEEE Press, 1992, New York,
oversampled analog to digital (A/D) converters are known which use coarse
quantization at a high sampling rate combined with negative feedback and
digital filtering to achieve increased resolution at a lower sampling rate. 
Such converters may, therefore, exploit the speed and density advantages
of modem very large scale integration (VLSI) while at the same time
reducing the requirements for component accuracy.In a type of oversampled A/D converter generally known as a
delta-sigma modulator, the analog input is sampled at a rate well above the
Nyquist frequency and fed to a quantizer via an integrator. The quantized
output is fed back and subtracted from the input. This feedback forces the
average value of the quantized output to track the average analog input
value. The present invention is directed to low cost analog to digital (A/D)
conversion apparatus suitable for processing an array of analog inputs
derived from an energy imager, such as an optical imager used in video
cameras.More specifically, the invention is directed to such A/D conversion
apparatus which is capable of being located on or adjacent to the
focal-plane sensor of an optical imager and which is characterized by the
use of a time
