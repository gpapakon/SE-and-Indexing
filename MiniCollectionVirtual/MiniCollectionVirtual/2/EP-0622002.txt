<ABSTRACT>
Video data and audio data are recorded in units of a pack onto a disk. A pack is constituted from a plurality of packets. When a packet of video data is present, if the picture at the top of the video packet is an I-picture, then an entry packet is disposed immediately prior to the video packet. In the entry packet, the positions of three prior and following packets are recorded. The position of the I-picture is detected from the data of the entry packet. The present invention makes it possible to locate the access point rapidly to achieve rapid searching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for
processing a variable-rate coded signal prior to recording so
that high-speed searching can be carried out on a recording
medium on which the processed signal is recorded. The invention
also relates to an apparatus and method for performing a
high-speed search on a medium on which a processed variable-rate
coded signal is recorded. Finally, the invention relates to a
recording of the processed variable-rate coded signal.Examples of a conventional recording apparatus and a
conventional reproducing apparatus are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Referring to Figure 1, a digital video signal to be recorded is
compressed and coded by the video encoder 1, and then fed into
the video signal buffer 4 in the multiplexing circuit 3. The
digital audio signal to be recorded is compressed and coded by
the audio encoder 2, and then fed into to the audio signal buffer
5 in the multiplexing circuit 3.The output terminals of the signal buffers 4 and 5 are
connected to the input terminals E1 and E2 of the switching 
circuit 6, respectively. The output terminal F of the switching
circuit 6 is connected to the input terminal of the header
addition circuit 7. The output of the header addition circuit
7 is supplied to the digital storage medium (DSM) 10, which
includes, for example, a magneto-optical disk or a magnetic disk,
e.g., a hard disk. The control circuit 8 receives system clock
signals from the multiplexing system clock generation circuit 9,
and causes the switching circuit 6 to connect the output terminal
F to the input terminals E1 and E2 successively at a
predetermined time interval. This successively fetches video
signal bytes from the video signal buffer 4 and audio signal
bytes from the audio signal buffer 5, thereby time division
multiplexing the audio and video signals.The control circuit 8 causes the switching circuit 6 and the
header addition circuit 7 to produce a multiplexed signal having
the format multiplexing system set forth in the ISO 11172 (MPEG)
standard, the multiplexed signal includes one or more packs
(PACK) and one ISO_11172_end_code. The ISO_11172_end_code is a
code of 32 bits and is, when represented in the hexadecimal
notation, 0x000001B9. The prefix Ox indicates hexadecimal
notation, where x is indeterminate.Each pack includes a header, which includes a
Pack_Start_Code, an System Clock Reference (SCR), a MUX_ Rate, and
one or more packets (Packet). The Pack_Start_Code of the header
is a code of 32 bits and is 0x000001B4, the prefix Ox once
