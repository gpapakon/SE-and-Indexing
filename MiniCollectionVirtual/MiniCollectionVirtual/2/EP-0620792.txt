<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thrust reverser for jet
engines, especially the type used on aircraft. More
particularly, the invention relates to a thrust reverser
which integrates a variable exhaust area nozzle.In order to reduce the landing distance of a jet
engine powered aircraft, as well as to increase the margin
of safety when the aircraft is landing on a wet or icy
runway, thrust reversers are utilized on the jet engines in
order to provide a braking thrust for the aircraft.
Typically, such thrust reversers are formed by thrust
reverser "doors" which are capable of pivoting between two
positions about an axis which is transverse and substantially
diametrical with respect to the jet of the engine.The first position finds the doors in a stowed position,
out of the direct path of the exhaust blast of the
engine. In this position, the doors form the exhaust
nozzle of the gas turbine engine so that the thrust of the
engine is directly rearward, thereby producing the forward
thrust of the aircraft. In the second position, the doors
are pivoted about the pivot axis to a transverse, blast
deflecting or deployed position, to intercept and redirect
the jet blast and produce the braking thrust for the
aircraft when needed. In such thrust reversers, the
trailing edge of the reverser doors must be fully scarfed
to enable the deployment of the doors and the butting of
the trailing edges of the two doors against one another in
the deployed position. This scarfing produces what is
known as a "fishmouth" shape at the exhaust outlet because
of its appearance when viewed from the side.The prior art demonstrates some variable area exhaust
nozzles for thrust reversers, and such devices are shown in 
U.S. Patent 4,966,327 and French Patent 2,614,939. Theoretically,
a variable area exhaust provides certain benefits
for the jet engines, in enabling them to adapt to
different conditions of the flight. For example, different
characteristics of the engines are desirable for take off,
climb and cruise modes of operation, and varying the
exhaust area enables the engine to better achieve the
optimum characteristics.According to the prior patents mentioned above which
integrate a variable exhaust area nozzle with the thrust
reverser, the thrust reverser doors do not (and cannot) in
any of the controllable positions of the reverser doors
define the throat of the exhaust nozzle to be at the
trailing edge of the nozzle/reverser doors. In these prior
patents, the inner flow line of the thrust reverser doors
is convergent to the
