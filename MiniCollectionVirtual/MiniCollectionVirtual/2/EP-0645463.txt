<ABSTRACT>
A piston ring for an internal combustion engine is 
formed of a TiAl-based intermetallic compound having a 

volume fraction Vf of L1₀ type TiAl (γ-phase) in a range 
represented by Vf ≧ 30%. Such piston ring has a light 

weight, a high rigidity and a high limit of the number 
of revolutions (rpm) of the engine. The piston ring is 

subjected to a thermal treatment, preferably between 
about 500°C and 900°C, and then a thin film of titanium 

nitride, chromium nitride, titanium-aluminum nitride or 

the like is formed on the surfaces by a physical vapor 
deposition process, such as ion-plating..

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piston ring for 
use in an internal combustion engine, hydraulic system 
or the like, and particularly, to a piston ring formed 
from TiAl-based intermetallic compound, and to a process 
for treating the surfaces thereof. There are conventionally known piston rings for 
internal combustion engines, which are formed from 
stainless steels such as JIS SUS420J2 and the like (for 
example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 35055/89). Currently, the number of revolutions and output of 
the internal combustion engine have tended to increase, 
and in correspondence to this, a reduction in weight is 
demanded or the piston rings. However, if a stainless 
steel is used as a material for forming the piston ring, 
such demand cannot be satisfied. In addition, a 
following problem is encountered: because a fluttering 
phenomenon is generated at a particular number of 
revolutions (rpm) of the engine of, for example, about 
5,000 rpm, due to the larger weight of the material, the 
amount of gas blown by and the amount of oil consumed 
are suddenly increased and hence, the limit of the  
 
maximum number of revolutions (rpm) is low whereby it is 
impossible to satisfy the demand for increasing the 
maximum revolution number (rpm) of the engine. Moreover, if stainless steel is used for the piston 
ring, there is another problem in that the ability of 
the piston to radiate heat through the piston ring to 
the cylinder wall is poor, because stainless steel has a 
relatively low thermal conductivity at the temperature 
of the environment around the piston ring in a range of 
250 to 350°C during operation of the engine. Whereupon, it can be conceived that the piston ring 
may be advantageously formed from a titanium alloy, a 
fiber-reinforced metal material or an aluminum alloy for 
reducing the weight. However, if the piston ring is formed from a 
titanium alloy, there is encountered a problem that the 
upper or lower surface of the piston ring or the inner 
surface of the ring groove is liable to be worn by 
sliding contact between the piston ring and the ring 
groove in the piston. And the ability of the piston to 
radiate heat through the piston ring to the cylinder 
wall is poor, because of a low thermal conductivity of 
the piston ring. If the piston ring is formed from a fiber-reinforced 
metal material, another disadvantage is liable to arise, 
namely, a reinforcing fiber such as whisker or the like 
may cause wear of the inner surface of the ring groove 
in the
