<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for continuously extruding a product, and forming it into a bend by applying a force (20) to it at a point of application downstream of where its surface becomes solid. The force has a transverse component relative to the die axis (18), and performs work upon the extruded material (5), extra to the work that has already been performed to extrude it. Non-contact means of applying the force are described, and various ram-type contacting means (33) are illustrated. Alternative means of operation are described in which the point of application of the force to the extrudate during bending varies relative both to the extrudate and to the die (4), relative to the extrudate only, and relative to the die only. Means to alter the direction of bending are described, and to diminish the necessary bending force by creating a fluctuating melt pressure within the die.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for the
continuous formation of an extruded product consisting of any
suitable extrudable material, but especially of materials
comprising a plastics base. It relates particularly to methods
of extrusion, and apparatus for carrying them out, as described
in International patent publication No. WO 90/08024.More particularly still, it relates to means for extruding an
elongated product of any section, but especially one of hollow
section, having a bent or sinuous configuration. One known
method of extruding a product of hollow section to such a
configuration is described for instance in an article on pages
38-39 of "Elastomerics", March 1986, and essentially requires
apparatus, referred to in the article as a "moving head
extruder", in which the inner member of the die can move out of
concentricity with the outer member in a carefully controlled
manner. When the inner and outer members of the die are not
concentric, so that they define between them an uneven annular
gap that is thicker to one side of the extrusion axis than the
other, extruded material leaves the die at an uneven speed, the
parts of the periphery which correspond to the thinnest and
thickest parts of the annular section travelling respectively
slowest and quickest. This tends to induce in the product a bend
in the axial plane which includes the two but displaced axes of
the inner and outer die members, the outside of the bend
corresponding to the part of the periphery where the material was
travelling fastest on leaving the die. Obvious limitations of
such a known process are that it applies only to dies which
extrude a hollow product and which therefore include an inner die
member, and also that the die is of variable geometry and the
mechanism for supporting the inner member and controlling its
translational movements relative to the outer one are necessarily
relatively complex and costly. Also, such a process can only 
apply where the extrudate on leaving the die is not yet solid, but still strictly a very viscous
fluid.An example of another known kind of method for bending an extruded product is
to be found in Patent Specification US-A-3748077. In this example, when the leading end
of the extrudate emerges from the die, it is received by a collar or clamp mounted at the free
end of a pivoted arm. As the extrudate then continues to emerge from the die, the region
engaged by the cap or clamp is constrained by the arm to follow a circular arc, so forming
the extrudate into a bend. In such a

<CLAIMS>
A method for the continuous formation of an extruded product, comprising:-

causing a first force-applying means (7) to generate a force to
perform work upon material (16) to extrude it through a die having a die

outlet (6) of fixed cross-section, at least the outer surface of the
extrudate (5) being solid as it leaves the die outlet;
causing a second force-applying means in the form of a plunger (28)
bearing on the extrudate (5) to apply a second force to the extrudate at a

point downstream of where its surface becomes solid, the second force
containing a component parallel to the direction in which the extrudate is

moving at said point, and by that second force performing further work
upon the material, extra to the work performed by the force generated by the

first force-applying means (7), causing the speed of the extrudate leaving
the die outlet over the part (21) of the periphery of its cross-section

corresponding to said point to exceed the speed over another part (22) of
that cross-section, whereby causing the extrudate to form into a permanent

bend, the inner and outer radii of which correspond to the parts of the
periphery moving at the relatively lesser and greater speed respectively.
A method according to Claim 1, in which the second force is applied by
solid-to-solid contact between the second force-applying means and the outer surface of the

extrudate.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which a surface of interface between liquid
and solid material exists wholly within the die, and the application of the second force

distorts the geometry of that surface.
A method according to Claim 3, in which the pressure of the liquid material within
the die is caused to fluctuate.
A method according to Claim 4, in which the pressure fluctuation is caused by

exposing the liquid material within the die to at least one reciprocating driven member.
A method according to Claim 5, in which there are at least two such reciprocating
driven members, programmed to execute related movements. 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which the second force-applying
means are fixed relative to the die, and in which the effect of the second force is to retard

the part of the extrudate periphery to which it is applied relative to other parts of that
periphery.
A method according to any of Claims 1 to 6, in which the point of application of the
second force moves, relative to the die, during the application of that force.
A method according to any preceding claim, in which the point of application of the
second force to the extrudate changes as bending proceeds.
A method according to any preceding claim, in which the second force is applied
to the extrudate without the use of any curved bend former.
Apparatus for carrying out the method of continuous formation of an extruded
product, according to Claim 1, comprising an extrusion die presenting a die outlet (6), and

at least one driven force-generating means (33) for applying said second force located
downstream of the die outlet and transversely of the extrudate, and operable to generate a

bending force to act upon the extrudate, in which the force generating means (33) includes
a plunger (28) operable to bear upon the extrudate surface while permitting relative

movement between plunger and surface in use.
Apparatus according to Claim 11 in which at least two pistons are mounted to bear
against the surface of the extrudate, and are spaced-apart from each other around the

extrudate periphery, whereby by differential operation of the pistons the extrudate can be
caused to bend in different directions.
Apparatus according to Claim 11 or 12 in which the force-generating means is
mounted to move.
Apparatus according to Claim 11 or 12 in which the force-generating means is fixed
relative to the die outlet.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 11 to 14 in which the generated force acts
upon the extrudate transversely relation to the die axis.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 11 to 14 in which the generated force acts
upon the extrudate in a direction having a component parallel to the die axis.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 11 to 16, in which the plunger includes a
roller by which it makes contact with the extrudate surface. 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 11 to 17 including at least one driven
reciprocable member, communicating with the interior of the extrusion die, and operable

to promote a fluctuating pressure in the liquid material with in the die.
