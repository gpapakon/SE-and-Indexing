<ABSTRACT>
Device for generating signals which are characteristic of the displacement of a closure means, such as a shutter, blind (awning) or door, consisting of a wiper (17a) fixed on a carriage (16) which is slidably mounted on a vibrating element such as a bar (6) and kinematically linked to the closure means (3). During displacement of the closure means, the wiper rubs against the vibrating element, the vibrations of which are detected by a sensor (7).

<CLAIMS>
Device for generating signals characteristic of 
the movement of a closure means, such as a shutter, blind 

or door, consisting of a wiper (17a) linked kinematically 
to the closure means, of a vibrating element (6; 19) 

extending over at least the length of the travel of the 
closure means and on which the wiper rubs during the 

movement of the closure means so as to vibrate the 
vibrating element, and of a vibration sensor (7) delivering 

a signal characteristic of these vibrations, characterized 
in that the wiper (17a) is fixed to a carriage 

(16; 21) mounted so as to slide over the vibrating 
element (6; 19) and linked kinematically to the closure 

means (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the vibrating element consists of a rod (6) or bar 

(19) stretched between two points, at least one of which 
includes a tensioning device (15; 28). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the rod (6) has a circular cross-section and that 

the carriage (16) has a springiness slit enabling it to 
be fitted laterally onto the vibrating rod by elastic 

separation. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the bar (19) has a rectangular cross-section and 

that the carriage (21) completely surrounds the bar. 
Device according to one of Claims 2, 3 or 4, for 
a closure means comprising slideways consisting of 

sections, characterized in that the rod or bar is fixed 
at each end of one of the slideways (4) by means of clips 

(10, 11; 24, 25) slipped over the end of the slideway. 
Device according to one of Claims 2, 3 or 5, 
characterized in that the rod (6) has a circular cross-section 

and is threaded, and that it carries at least one 
nut (14, 15) at one end for tensioning it. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the clips (24, 25) have a hook-shaped part for 

fixing (18) the rod or bar by catching, the rod or bar  
 

having, for this purpose, holes (22, 23) into which the 
said hooks are engaged. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that one of the clips (24) is equipped with a screw (28) 

bearing on the end of the slideway in order to tension 
the said rod or bar. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the vibrating element is a stretched metal wire, in 

particular a piano string. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the vibrating element is a bar fixed rigidly by one 

of its ends. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the carriage (16; 21) is connected 

to the closure means (3) via a flexible link (17b). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the said flexible link (17b) and the wiper (17a) 

consist of a single strip (17), a profiled end of which 
is fixed by clipping onto a profile (18), such as a stud 

or rib of the closure means.
