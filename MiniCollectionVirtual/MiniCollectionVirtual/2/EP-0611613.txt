<ABSTRACT>
The crimping tool (10) has a plurality of crimping jaws (48) for all-round crimping of the ferrule onto the round section. The crimping jaws (48) are provided with pressing faces (50) for bearing on the ferrule during the pressing operation. In addition, two lever arms (14) are rotatably mounted on the crimping tool (10), each having a holding-end portion (20) and an actuating-end portion (26), between which the lever arms (14) are rotatably mounted about pivots (16). Two crimping jaw-holding parts (22) for holding two crimping jaws (48) are rotatably mounted on the holding-end portions (20); this is the only connection between the crimping jaw-holding parts (22) and the lever arms (14). As a result of the pivotable mounting of the crimping jaw-holding parts (22), the latter move during the pressing operation centrally towards the ferrule, are thus radially moved towards the ferrule. Insofar as the crimping jaws (48) are guided on the crimping jaw-holding parts (22) so as to be displaceable in a direction running transversely to their pressing direction, it is also ensured during the entire pressing operation that the pressing faces (50) move radially with respect to the ferrule.

A pressing tool for pressing a cylindrical pressing member 
or a pressing member comprising a cylindrical pressing 

portion onto a round profile, particularly a pipe conduit, 
comprising 


a plurality of press dies (48) for pressing the pressing 
member (78) onto the round profile (90) from all 

sides, the press dies (48) comprising pressing surfaces 
(50) for abutting the pressing member (78) during 

a press-connecting procedure, 
two rotatably supported lever arms (14), each comprising 
a holding end section (20) and an actuating end 

section (26) between which the lever arms (14) are 
rotatably supported, and 
two press die holding members (22) for holding at 
least one press die (48) each, characterized in 
that the two press die holding members (22) are 
rotatably supported at the holding end sections (20) 

of the two lever arms (14) without any controlled 
guidance. 
The pressing tool of claim 1, characterized in that at 
least two press dies (48) are supported at at least one of 

the two press die holding members (22) so as to be displaceable 
in a direction (60,62) which extends in an angle 

to the movement of the pressing surfaces (50) of the press 
dies (48) during the press-connecting procedure. 
The pressing tool of claim 2, characterized in that two 
press dies (48) are displaceably supported at each of the 

two press die holding members (22).  
 
The pressing tool of claim 3, characterized in that the 
press dies (48) of each press die holding member (22) are 

offset from each other by 90°. 
The pressing tool of claim 3 or 4, characterized in that 
the displacement directions (60,62) of the press dies (48) 

each extend under an angle of 45° to the direction of movement 
of the press die holding members (22) during the 

press-connecting procedure. 
The pressing tool of any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that at least one stationary guiding element (84) 

is provided which comprises two open guiding recesses (98) 
substantially pointing to the holding end sections (20) of 

the lever arms (14) and being in alignment with each other, 
for receiving and axially fixing as well as centrically 

guiding a fitting (86) between the guiding recesses (98) 
during the press-connecting procedure. 
The pressing tool of claim 6, characterized in that the 
guiding recesses (98) are each limited at both sides by a 

pair of guiding projections (96) of the guiding element 
(84), and that, for axially fixing the fitting (86), an 

outer projection (100) thereof is held so as to be enclosed 
between the guiding projections (96) of the two guiding 

recesses (98). 
The pressing tool of claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
two guiding elements (84) are provided whose guiding recesses 

(98) are in alignment in directions parallel to the 
rotational axis (16) of the lever arms (14). 
The pressing tool of claim 8, characterized in that the 
pressing member (78) is adapted to be axially fixed between 

the guiding elements (84). 
The pressing tool of any one of claims 7 to 9, characterized 
in that the guiding projections (96) of the inner  

 
guiding recesses (98), which face each other, are arranged 

at both front ends of the pressing member (78) for axially 
fixing the pressing member (78).
