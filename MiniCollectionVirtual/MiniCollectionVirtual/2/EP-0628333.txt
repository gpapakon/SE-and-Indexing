<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for purifying liquid 
polluted with solids particles, in which the liquid is fed 

into a settling tank, in such a manner that the solids particles 
settle, effluent being discharged by effluent discharge 

means and the sediment being passed into a sludge sump, a 
sediment suspension being formed in the sludge sump, the 

method being characterized in that the density of the suspension 
is measured, sediment being supplied until the measured 

density of the suspension attains a preset value, whereafter 
the entire contents of the sludge sump are discharged 

from the sludge sump at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for purifying liquid 
polluted with solids particles, in which method the liquid is 
fed into a settling tank where the solids particles are 
allowed to settle, with effluent being discharged and the 
sediment being passed into a sludge sump where a sediment 
suspension is formed. In the purification of liquids polluted with settleable 
solid particles, such as for instance waste water, it is 
conventional to supply the waste water to a settling tank 
where the waste water is stored for some time. The solids 
particles then sink to the bottom of the settling tank, where 
a layer of sediment is formed. The relatively clean water, 
referred to as effluent, is discharged at the top of the 
settling tank, for instance into open water. For the purpose 
of the discharge of the sediment, a part of the sediment is 
periodically or continuously deposited by mechanical means 
into a sludge sump, arranged under the settling tank. In the 
sludge sump, the sediment is brought into, and maintained in, 
suspension, for instance by means of stirrers, a part of the 
suspension being continuously discharged from the sludge sump. In the supplied polluted liquid, referred to as influent, 
the concentration of the settleable solid matter is generally 
not constant in time and may even be subject to large fluctuations. 
Thus, the solid particle concentration of waste 
water from companies and sewerage systems, for instance, will 
change markedly in case of cleaning activities, pipe fracture, 
heavy downpours and the like. The prior art method has the 
disadvantage that, as a result of the large fluctuations in 
the supply of solid particles in the influent, the density of 
the suspension discharged from the sludge sump will also be 
subject to large fluctuations, which requires that the plant 
for further treating the suspension be adapted to the maximum 
supply of solid particles because otherwise there is a possibility 
that the sediment cannot be processed, with the consequence 
that, for instance, the mechanical means for passing  
 
the sediment into the sludge sump may jam, the treatment plant 
may be overloaded or the settling tank and the sludge sump may 
clog up. Because the treatment plant has to be adapted to the 
maximum density of the suspension the treatment plant will 
most of the time work at less than its maximum capacity, the 
consequence being that the apparatus has to be designed to be 
greater than is necessary most of the time, so that the 
apparatus is relatively
