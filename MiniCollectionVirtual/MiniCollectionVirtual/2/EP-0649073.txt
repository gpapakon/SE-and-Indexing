<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus which will collect residual toners latent image carrier in a developing unit.In image recording apparatuses, such as a copying machine, a printer and a facsimile, a latent image forming apparatus like an electrophotographic apparatus is used due to the popularity of image recording on normal sheets of paper. Such an image forming apparatus forms an electrostatic latent image on a photosensitive drum or the like. Then, the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum is developed with a powder developer to provide a visible image. The developed image on the photosensitive drum is then transferred on a sheet, which in turn is separated from the photosensitive drum. Thereafter, the developed image on the sheet is fixed.The efficiency of transferring the developer on a sheet is not 100%, and some toners (developer) will remain on the photosensitive drum. Therefore, the residual toners should be cleaned off. A cleaner is thus provided to remove the residual toners. This residual-toner removing process requires a mechanism for storing the residual toners, thus inevitably enlarging the image forming apparatus. As the toners collected by the cleaner do not contribute to printing, this process is not economical. Further, the disposal of the toners will raise an environmental problem. In this respect, it is desirable to develop and use an image forming process which does not waste or dispose of toners.Fig. 31 is an explanatory diagram of prior art.Such an image forming apparatus will be described below as an electrophotographic printer. As shown in Fig. 31, after a precharger 91 uniformly charges the surface of a photosensitive drum 90, an exposing unit 92 exposes the photosensitive drum 90 to a light image to form an electrostatic latent image thereon. A developing unit 93 is provided to develop the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 90. This developing unit 93 supplies a powder developer (e.g., one-component magnetic toners or a two-component developer) to the photosensitive drum 90 to develop the electrostatic latent image.A transfer unit 94 transfers the developed image on the photosensitive drum 90 onto a sheet that has been fed out from a sheet cassette not shown. The sheet carrying the transferred image is fed to a fixing unit 96 where the developed image is fixed on the sheet. The residual toners on the photosensitive drum 90 after image transfer are distributed over the drum 90 by a distribution brush 95.In this
