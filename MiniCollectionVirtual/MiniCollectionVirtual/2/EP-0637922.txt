<DESCRIPTION>
 FOLDING DISPLAY FRAME FOR FORMINGCOLUMN-LIKE STRUCTURESField of the inventionThis invention relates to folding display frames, and more particularly, to a foldable display-supporting frame useful in forming long, narrow column or bridge-like structures for folding display frames.Background of the Invention Folding display frames are commonly used at trade shows for holding display panels assembled into a temporary display stand. Photomural displays and other graphics, projection screens, product display shelves, and the like are commonly mounted on the portable display stands.Folding display frames typically comprise a number of rigid frame members pivotally connected together at their ends in a collapsible and portable form. The framework, in its expanded or open form, commonly consists of a grid of horizontal and vertical rod members forming an array of frame-like compartments or cubicles. The frame-is carried to the exhibition hall in its collapsed form and is then erected to form the rigid structural framework for the display stand. Display panels which are mounted to the display frame, and other structural members of the supporting frame, also are carried to the trade show in a compact form. 

The entire folding display system is then assembled into the finished display unit. When the trade show is completed, the display frame is collapsed, and the display system is carried away in its portable form. In a typical three-dimensional framework, a plurality of rod members are pivotally joined together to permit collapsing of the framework into a compact form in which . the rod members lie substantially parallel to each other. Except where the framework is assembled in a substantially permanent structure, the rod members are pivotally joined at their ends to some type of hub, on which the rods can pivot relative to each other as the framework is adjusted between its open, expanded configuration and its closed compact storage configuration. An example of a foldable display frame that opens into an array of pivotally interconnected cubicles is disclosed in my U.S. Patent No. 4,986,016,- which is incorporated herein by this reference. In the display frame shown in that patent, the expanded display frame is collapsed by folding the pivotally joined rod members along two perpendicular axes until all rod members are substantially parallel to each other, with the hubs at the ends of the folded structure being nested closely to one another in a compact form.One of the objectives in designing folding display
