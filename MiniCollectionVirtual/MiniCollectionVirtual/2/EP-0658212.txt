<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the analysis of
deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") and ribonucleic acid
("RNA"), the determination of the presence of a
predetermined specific DNA and/or RNA nucleotide sequence,
and the exponential amplification of such a sequence.An ability to detect the presence of a nucleic
acid molecule having a particular predetermined sequence
is of substantial importance in a variety of fields, such
as forensics, medicine, epidemiology and public health,
and in the prediction and diagnosis of disease. Such an
ability can aid criminal investigations, by excluding
wrongly accused individuals or by implicating culpable
parties. It can be exploited to permit the identification
of the causal agent of infectious disease, or the
characterization of tumors and tissue samples, or ensure
the wholesomeness of blood products.An ability to detect the presence of a
particular nucleic acid sequence in a sample is important
in predicting the likelihood that two individuals are
related to one another, or that an individual will suffer
from a genetic disease. Such an ability can also be used
in assays to determine the purity of drinking water, milk,
or other foods. In many cases of interest, the desired nucleic
acid sequence is present at a very low concentration in
the sample. In such cases, unless assay sensitivity can
be increased through the use of sophisticated labels, the
presence of the desired molecule may escape detection.
Assay sensitivity may be increased by altering the manner
in which detection is reported or signaled to the
observer. Thus, for example, assay sensitivity can be
increased through the use of detectably labeled reagents.
A wide variety of such labels have been used for this
purpose: enzyme labels (Kourilsky et al.; U.S. Patent
4,581,333); radioisotopic labels (Falkow et al., U.S.
Patent 4,358,535; Berninger, U.S. Patent 4,446,237);
fluorescent labels (Albarella et al., EP 144914); chemical
labels (Sheldon III et al., U.S. Patent 4,582,789;
Albarella et al., U.S. Patent 4,563,417), modified bases
(Miyoshi et al., EP 119448), etc.Although the use of highly detectable labeled
reagents can improve the sensitivity of nucleic acid
detection assays, the sensitivity of such assays remains
limited by practical problems which are largely related to
non-specific reactions that increase the background signal
produced in the absence of the nucleic acid the assay is
designed to detect. Thus, for some applications, the
anticipated concentration of the desired nucleic acid
molecule will be too low

primer extension reaction, to thereby form a

Primer extension product whose 3' terminus
abuts said 5' terminus of said hybridized

Blocker Oligonucleotide; then conducting step
(d*);
(d*) ligating said abutting 3' terminus of any of
said hybridized Primer Oligonucleotide of

step (c*) (1) or said abutting 3' terminus of 
any of said hybridized Primer extension

product of step (c*) (2) to said 5' terminus
of any of said hybridized Blocker

Oligonucleotide to thereby form a ligation
product having the sequence of these Primer

Oligonucleotide or said Primer extension
product, and the sequence of said Blocker

Oligonucleotide;
(e*) hybridizing said End-Run Oligonucleotide to
said sequence of said Blocker Oligonucleotide

of any of said ligation product; and
(f*) extending the 3' terminus of said hybridized
End-Run Oligonucleotide in a polymerase-mediated,

template-dependent primer extension
reaction to form and amplify said End-Run

extension product.
The method of claim 9, or that of claim 14, or that of
claim 20, or that of claim 22, wherein prior to performing

the respective steps (AA), or (A'), or (A"), or (A*), the
concentration of said target nucleic acid is amplified

according to the method of claim 1.
A kit for amplification of at least one target sequence
comprising at least one region having a defined nucleic acid

sequence, the said kit comprising a container, and at least
one set of reagent moieties, the or each set consisting of a

Blocker moiety; a Primer moiety; and an End-Run moiety,
whereby in normal use of such a set of reagent moieties with

appropriate polymerisation and ligating agents, the Blocker
moiety is capable of hybridizing to a portion of the nucleic

acid sequence, the Primer moiety is capable of hybridizing
to a different portion of the nucleic acid sequence, and the

End-Run moiety comprises a sequence which is complementary
to at least a portion of the Blocker moiety.
The kit of claim 25 further including at least one
buffer capable of providing buffering capacity for said

amplification. 
The kit of claim 25 further including at least one
enzyme selected from the group consisting of polymerase and

ligase.
The kit of claim 26 wherein the buffering compound is
tris hydroxymethyl amino methane hydrochloric acid.
The kit of claim 25 further including additives
selected from the group consisting of potassium chloride,

magnesium chloride, dithiothreitol, nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, bovine serum albumin, and non-ionic detergent.
Use of tris hydroxymethyl amino methane hydrochloric
acid in the method of claim 1.
The method of claim 1 wherein said End-Run
Oligonucleotide has a 3' end such that when hybridized to

said sequence of said Blocker Oligonucleotide, said 3' end
extends beyond the 5' end of said Blocker Oligonucleotide.
The method of claim 9, or that of claim 14, or that of
claim 20, or that of claim 22, wherein said End-Run

Oligonucleotide has a 3' end such that when hybridized under
conditions to permit nucleic acid hybridization of said End-Run

Oligonucleotide to a portion of said Blocker
Oligonucleotide sequence, said 3' end extends beyond the 5'

end of said Blocker Oligonucleotide.
