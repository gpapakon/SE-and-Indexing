<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polypeptides which are useful in the treatment of vascular
disorders such as thrombosis. This invention further relates to the production by
recombinant DNA-directed methods of 
pharmacologically useful quantities of the polypeptides
of the present invention.The term "hemostasis" refers to those processes
which comprise the defense mechanisms of the body
against loss of circulating blood caused by vascular
injury. Processes which are normal as a physiologic
response to vascular injury may lead in pathologic
circumstances, such as in a patient afflicted with
atherosclerotic vascular disease or chronic congestive
heart failure, to the formation of undesired thrombi
(clots) with resultant vascular occlusion. Impairment
of blood flow to organs under such circumstances may
lead to severe pathologic states, including myocardial
infarction, a leading cause of mortality in developed
countries.The restriction or termination of the flow of
blood within the circulatory system in response to a
wound or as a result of a vascular disease state
involves a complex series of reactions which can be
divided into two processes, primary and secondary
hemostasis. Primary hemostasis refers to the process
of platelet plug or soft clot formation. The platelets
are non-nucleated discoid structures approximately 2-5
microns in diameter derived from megakaryocytic cells.
Effective primary hemostasis is accomplished by
platelet adhesion, the interaction of platelets with
the surface of damaged vascular endothelium on which
are exposed underlying collagen fibers and/or other
adhesive macromolecules such as proteoglycans and
glycosaminoglycans to which platelets bind.Secondary hemostasis involves the reinforcement or
crosslinking of the soft platelet clot. This secondary
process is initiated by proteins circulating in the
plasma (coagulation factors) which are activated during 
primary hemostasis, either in response to a wound or a
vascular disease state. The activation of these
factors results ultimately in the production of a
polymeric matrix of the protein fibrinogen (then called
fibrin) which reinforces the soft clot.The present invention relates to antiplatelet
drugs. Antiplatelet drugs include drugs which suppress
primary hemostasis by altering platelets or their
interaction with other circulatory system components.Specific antiplatelet drugs operate by one or
several mechanisms. A first example involves reducing
the availability of ionized calcium within the platelet
cytoplasm thereby impairing
