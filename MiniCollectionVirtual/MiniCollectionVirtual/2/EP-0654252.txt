<ABSTRACT>
A dental prophylaxis and water conservation device for in-home use. The device 
includes a tank coupled to the household water supply line and adapted to receive water 

which causes air contained within the tank to be pressurized. The water and air from within 
the tank are connected by lines to a handplece which discharges both mediums 

simultaneously. Water leaving the tank passes through a container having an abrasive 
material which is picked up by the water and also discharged. The tank is further coupled 

to a plumbing fixture, such as a shower head. This enables the tank to be used as a water 
conservation device by allowing cold water to be purged from a hot water line into the tank, 

and subsequently used to provide water to the plumbing fixture. To recycle the purged water, 
the present invention entrains the water from within the tank as water from the supply line is 

being provided to the plumbing fixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a dental prophylaxis and water conservation device
for home use. More particularly, the invention relates to a combination dental prophylaxis and
water conservation device which is particularly suited to cleaning and providing prophylaxis
of teeth, gingiva and other oral tissue while conserving purged cold water from a hot water
supply line within the home.Over the years, numerous dental devices have been proposed which provide
prophylaxis through what is commonly referred to as a "sandblasting" technique. While
sometimes intended for home use, these devices are more often only appropriate for office
or clinical use because of the additional equipment needed for their operation. This
equipment is both complex and expensive.Generally, the above mentioned cleaning technique directs an abrasive laden fluid
stream at the teeth, gingiva and other oral tissue. The abrasive stream cleans out food
particles while removing plaque from the surfaces of the teeth and at the tooth/gingiva
interface. Additionally, the devices stimulate circulation in the gingiva and oxygenate various
anaerobic bacteria, both of which help to prevent periodontal diseases.One of the first devices of the above mentioned type is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,972,123. The device of the '123 patent discloses a nozzle which ejects an abrasive laden
air stream surrounded by a shroud of warm water. Improving on the '123 patent is U.S.
Patent No. 4,174,571. The '571 patent discloses the use of a water soluble abrasive in the
air stream. Unfortunately, both of these systems are quite elaborate and therefore costly to
produce, manufacture, purchase and maintain, all of which make them not particularly suited
for home use. One general problem with these particular types of devices is that the nozzle of the
devices are susceptible to becoming clogged by the abrasive in the air stream and therefore
require frequent maintenance. This problem has led to the development of numerous devices
which utilize some variety of mechanism for agitating of the abrasive material in an attempt
to prevent the discharge ports from becoming clogged. For obvious reasons, a device which
is not susceptible to clogging without the added expense of an agitating mechanism is
desirable.U.S. Patent No. 4,214,871 discloses the introduction of a soluble abrasive particle into
the liquid stream which is discharged against the teeth and gingiva. In this device, water, at
household pressures, is delivered through a nozzle that entrains the
