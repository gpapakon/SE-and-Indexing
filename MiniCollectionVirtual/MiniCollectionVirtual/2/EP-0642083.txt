<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a test circuit, a test system and a 
test method which provides interconnect capability for chips 

(100, 110). Each of the chips (100, 110) comprises combinational 
logic (172, 173, 160, 161, 176, 177) as well as a 

plurality of scan chains (170, 171, 150, 151, 174, 175). 
Test data is shifted into the scan chains from pattern 

generators (180, 181) and is then transmitted from a selected 
sending chip (100) via its transceiver means (130) to the 

receiving chip (110). The chip (100) is selected by the 
selector (120) which is integrated in chip (100). During an 

interconnect test sequence different ones of the chips 
comprised in the test system are selected by the selector 

(120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit, system and method which 
provides interconnect test capability for chips, whereby 
each of the chips comprises transceiver means and storage 
means. One of the best known test methods for testing large scale 
integrated circuits is level sensitive scan design (LSSD) 
which is described in the article "A Logic Design Structure 
for LSI Testability", Proceedings of the Design Automation 
Conference, No. 14, 20-22, June 1977, New Orleans, Louisiana, 
by E.B. Eichelberger. See also US-A-4 590 078, 
US-A-4 428 060 and E.J. McCluskey, "A Survey of Design for 
Testability Scan Techniques", VLSI Design, December 1984, 
pp. 38-61, for a comprehensive list of patents and publications 
for the testing of electronic structures. Cordt W. Starke, "Design for Testability and Diagnosis in a 
VLSI CMOS System/370 Processor", IBM Journal of Research and 
Development, Volume 34, No. 2/3, March/May 1990, pp. 355 - 
362, describes a design of combinational logic circuits 
which incorporates on-chip test pattern generation and on-chip 
test response evaluation for logic fault detection. In 
this paper, the combinational logic circuits are coupled 
together in a typical level-sensitive scan design (LSSD) by 
shift register latches (SRL's) which are configured to form 
a test scan path. The test patterns are generated by a 
linear feed back shift register (LFSR) which is configured 
as a pseudo-random pattern generator and which is implemented 
on the chip. To apply a test pattern, the shift register 
latches are loaded via the test scan path. Then the system 
clocks are pulsed once in order to execute one operational 
cycle of the system. After the system clocks have been 
applied, the test response is shifted out of the shift  
 
register latches via the test scan path for further evaluation. 
However, the above cited prior art is silent as to 
interconnect testing of chips and only refers to the internal 
testing of a chip. IEEE Standard 1149.11 and C.M. Maunder, R.E. Tulloss, "The 
Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture", IEEE 
Computer Society Press, 1990, describe a boundary-scan 
architecture which - in principle - allows the testing of 
chip interconnections. One disadvantage of that architecture 
is, that it does not allow the simulation of high speed data 
links between chips. In IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Volume 34, No. 6, 
November 1991, pp. 325-330, by P.K. Graham an AC interconnect 
test with series boundary scan is described. If an 
interconnection between two
