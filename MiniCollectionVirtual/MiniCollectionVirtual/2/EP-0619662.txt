<ABSTRACT>
A packet data transmission system is used to link a number of remote hand-held 
data-gathering units such as bar code readers to a central computer. Data packets are 

sent from the remote units by a spread spectrum RF link to intermediate base stations, 
then sent by the base stations to the central computer by a serial link. The remote 

hand-held units initiate an RF exchange to and from the base stations, receiving only 
during a time window following a transmission from the remote unit. The base stations 

cannot initiate an exchange with the remote units, but instead send data to the remote 
units only as part of the exchange. To alert a remote unit when a message is waiting 

at a base station to be sent to a particular unit, some of the acknowledge (base-to-remote) 
packets sent by the base station may contain an identification such as a list of 

all remote units (identified by ID number) which have messages waiting. Alternatively, 
a bit map can be used to identify these remotes. These base-to-remote packets with the 

identification of remotes with messages waiting are called "announcements." Each 
remote unit (if not engaged in regular exchanges for a time interval) periodically listens 

(activates its receiver) to receive an announcement packet containing such a list or bit 
map and decodes this announcement to see if it has a message waiting. If so, this 

remote unit then sends a transmit packet so the base can send the waiting message in 
an acknowledge packet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data communication systems, and more particularly to
an RF packet communication system in which a number of remote units send data to
a central computer via intermediate base stations.In US-A-5,029,183, (referred to herein
as "Pat. 5,029,183"), a packet data communication system is disclosed using a message-exchange
protocol in which a base station only sends a message to a remote terminal
in response to a message from the remote terminal. The remote terminal sends a
message to the base station only at a time of its own choosing, so the transceiver of the
remote terminal need not be continuously powered. The base station responds to a
message from a remote terminal within a rigid time window following the message
from the remote terminal. If there is a need to send a message originating at the base
station (or at a central computer), then the base station must wait until a message is
received from the remote before it can send the waiting message as part of its response
in the fixed time window. The system of Pat. 5,029,183, in an example embodiment,
employs spread spectrum RF transmission.The system of Pat. 5,029,183 provides a great improvement in the power drain
on a battery in a remote terminal, and thus allows construction of smaller, lighter, and
cheaper remote terminals. To improve the communication channel from the base or
central computer to the remote units, a way of periodically notifying the remote
terminals that messages are waiting to be sent to them would reduce the average delay
time between message initiation and message receipt. As disclosed in Pat. 5,029,183,
this communication channel may be facilitated by having the remote units periodically
(every half-minute or so) send a message to their base station, even though there is no
new data to send, so that if a message to the remote is waiting it can be sent with the
reply in the fixed window. This method provides two-way communication when only 
one side can originate messages, but it nevertheless requires the remote units to
periodically energize their transmitters, and it adds to traffic on the RF medium.EP-A-0 529 269 discloses a method and apparatus for conserving battery power in
a wireless link adapter of a battery operated computer such as a portable laptop
computer, as controlled by a scheduled multiaccess protocol. The portable
computer is operable as a mobile unit in a multi-cell wireless network. The
scheduled access multiaccess protocol is implemented to effectively conserve
battery power by
