<ABSTRACT>
Locations of respective image (11) frames contained 
on an image recording, such as a continuous color 

photographic film strip (10) scanned by digitizing opto-electronic 
scanner (12) are identified by storing scanline (25) 

data produced by the scanner in a digital database, and 
processing the stored scanline data to generate a 

predictor space which is used to identify locations of 
all the minimally valid frames. Thereafter, the well 

formed image frames are used to produce statistics which 
are used to detect the location of other frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image
processing systems and is particularly directed to a
frame detection mechanism for locating the positions of
respective image(s).Automated photographic film handling
processes, such as film scanning and printing
processes, require the ability to accurately position
the film at the location of each exposure (image
frame). For example, photofinishing systems
customarily prescan a strip of (35mm) color film to
examine the quality and color content of the respective
image frames prior to transferring the images to print
paper. On the basis of this prescan examination,
exposure control parameters of the scanning optics
components are defined so that, during a second pass of
the film, the projection of each image onto the print
medium will be properly adjusted to yield an acceptable
quality hard copy print.In order to accurately identify where each
image is located, it is conventional practice to form
respective notches along the edge of the film, for
example between successive frames, or centrally of each
frame. When the film is rescanned, these notches are
used to identify successive frames for rescanning of
optical printing. A shortcoming of such an exposure
control procedure is the fact that a notch is sometimes
missed or mislocated. When this happens, a mismatch
between the current image frame and prescan-derived
exposure control parameters can occur. The result is a
poor quality set of prints, making it necessary for the
photofinisher to reprocess the film strip, which 
entails additional time, and costs associated with the
wasted print materials. Although a minor lag in
processing can be adequately managed, when a large reel
of film is to be scanned continuously on a single
machine and then printed on the same (or other)
machine, it is too complex to track and detect possible
sequence errors.One attempt to remedy this notch misalignment
problem, described in the U.S. Patent to Benker et al,
No. 4,947,205, is to make use of the film density
change occurring at interframe gaps between successive
image frames. In accordance with the system described
in the '205 patent, film density change measurements
are conducted in order to compensate for 'slippage'
between the film strip transport reels and the film
strip itself. A counter is operative, in conjunction
with film transport notches along the sides of the
length of the film, to provide an indication of film
advance, and it is assumed that well formed image
frames are properly spaced apart by periodically spaced
(Dmin)

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting the locations of
respective image frames contained on an image recording

medium, comprising the steps of:

(a) scanning said image recording medium
so as to produce data representative of the contents of

successive scan lines of said image recording medium;
(b) reducing such scanned data to
produce predictor vectors associated with image frame

parameters related to frame location, thereby
generating a predictor space for applying frame identifiers;
(c) producing a series of thresholds
based upon the predictor space and upon a series of

predetermined statistics;
(d) determining all the well formed
image frames by applying the thresholds

determined in step (c) onto predictor vectors
and
(e) using the determined well formed
image frames to produce frame statistics

to detect the location of image frames ot
well formed image frames.
The method of claim 1 wherein the
predictor vectors include scan line sums, and

comparisons of
adjacent scan line sums.
The method of claim 2 wherein the
predetermined statistics includes a calculation of

cummulative percentile of predictor vectors.
The method of claim 2 wherein the frame
statistics are the minimum, maximum and average frame

size and the minimum, maximum and overage
between well formed image frames. 
The method of claim 3 wherein using the
frame statistics includes proceeding forwardly and rearwardly to

locate frames which are 
characterized by
 only one edge.
The method of claim 3 wherein the size
of all determined frames are adjusted to be the same to

a predescribed size which is based upon the need of a
user device.
The method of claim 6 wherein the size
adjustment includes locating the center portion of a

frame if the frame size is larger than prescribed size
and edge(s) detected.
The method of claim 1 wherein the
thresholds include minimum and maximum set of

thresholds and the thresholds are iteratively increased
from the minimum to search for unidentified frames.
The method of claim 1 further including
the step of determining frames which abut each other

without a gap between them based upon the exterior
edges of the adjacent frames.
The method of claim 1 wherein in
determining well formed frames their leading and

trailing edges are detected and further including the
step of detecting edges which traverse multiple scan

lines.
