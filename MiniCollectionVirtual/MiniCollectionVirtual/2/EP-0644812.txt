A process for brazing a metallic honeycomb body (1) which is 
coiled, layered or wound from at least partially structure sheet metal 

layers (2, 3) and which is to be brazed at least in partial regions (5, 
6), comprising the following steps: 


a) at least the structure sheet metal layers (2) are provided with 
a thin coating of a rolling oil (4) if this is not already present from 

the process for production of the sheet metal layers (2); 
b) the rolling oil coating (4) is subjected to a heat treatment to 
remove easily volatile constituents; 
c) the regions (5, 6) of the sheet metal layers (2, 3) which are to 
be provided with brazing material are brought into contact with an 

aqueous solution of a tenside; and 
d) the honeycomb bodies (1) produced from the sheet metal layers 
are brought into contact with brazing powder which remains adhering to 

locations where rolling oil residues and tenside have come together. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the rolling 
oil is already applied in the operation of rolling the sheet metal 

layers (2, 3). 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the rolling oil is composed of mineral oils, greases and additives. 
A process according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3 characterised 
in that a concentrate containing ab
out 15 to 30% of non-ionic tensides, 
citric acid and dissolution aid is diluted with about 85 to 97%, 

preferably 92 to 95% water, and then brought into contact with the 
regions (5, 6) to be brazed.  

 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the aqueous solution of the tenside is applied by means of a 

short-pile velvet pad by the pad being saturated with the aqueous 
solutions and pressed against the ends of the honeycomb body (1). 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the heat treatment of the rolling oil is effected at a 

temperature of about 150 to 250°C, preferably at about 200 to 230°C. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that contacting of the honeycomb body with the aqueous solution of a 

tenside is effected at a temperature of the honeycomb body of about 60 
to 95°C, preferably about 70 to 90°C. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the honeycomb body is dried after contacting with the aqueous 

solution of a tenside at about 100 to 160°C, preferably about 130 to 
150°C. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the heat treatment of the coating of rolling oil and/or drying 

after contacting with the aqueous solution of a tenside is effected by 
means of a through flow using hot air. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that the honeycomb body is dipped at its end into a fluidised bed 

(12, 13, 14) of brazing material powder (14) so that the regions (5, 6) 
in which the remains of the rolling oil (4) and the aqueous solution of 

a tenside have been contacted with each other come into contact with the 
brazing material powder (14).  

 
A process according to claim 10 characterised in that the 
fluidised bed (12, 13, 14) comprises an accumulation of fine-grain 

brazing material powder (14) which is fluidised from below by means of a 
dry gas, preferably an inert gas. 
A process according to claim 11 characterised in that the fine-grain 
brazing material powder (14) has grain sizes of between 1 and 200 

µm, preferably grain sizes of between 38 and 125 µm, wherein grain sizes 
in the lower half of that range occur more frequently than those in the 

upper half. 
A process according to claim 10, claim 11 or claim 12 
characterised in that the honeycomb body (11) is moved to and fro while 

it remains in the fluidised bed (12, 13, 14) so that brazing material 
powder (7) is urged into gaps near the locations (5) to be brazed. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that to secure the applied brazing material powder to 

prevent it from falling out in further processing operations a film of 
an adhesive, preferably isopropanol, is sprayed on. 
A process according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that when brazing a honeycomb body at the ends only 

approximately the following amounts of brazing material are applied:
 
   about 0.1 g per cm
2
 with a honeycomb body with 15.50 cells/cm
2
 (100 
cpsi),
 
   about 0.15 g per cm
2
 with a honeycomb body with 62.02 cells/cm
2
 
(400 cpsi), and
 
   about 0.2 g per cm
2
 with a honeycomb body with 93.02 cells/cm
2
 (600 
cpsi).  

 
Apparatus for brazing a metallic honeycomb body (1) which is 
coiled, layered or wound from at least partially structured sheet metal 

layers (2, 3) and which is to be brazed at least in partial regions (5, 
6), including the following parts: 


a) a heating station for the heat treatment of the honeycomb body, 
in particular with a flow of hot air therethrough, at a temperature of 

about 150 to 250°C, preferably 200 to 230°C; 
b) an application station for applying an aqueous solution of a 
tenside with an absorbent material to one or more ends of the honeycomb 

body; 
c) a drying station for subsequent drying in an air flow at about 
100 to 160°C, preferably 130 to 150°C; and 
d) a brazing material-application station with an accumulation of 
brazing material powder (14) through which a gas (11, 12) flows from 

below in such a way that a fluidised bed is formed. 
Apparatus according to claim 16 characterised in that the 
application station has a short-pile velvet pad which can be saturated 

with the aqueous solution of a tenside. 
Apparatus according to claim 16 characterised in that the 
brazing station has a container (10) which can be filled with brazing 

material powder (14) and whose intermediate false bottom is formed by a 
sintered metal plate (13) and can have compressed air or an inert gas 

flowing therethrough from below (12).
