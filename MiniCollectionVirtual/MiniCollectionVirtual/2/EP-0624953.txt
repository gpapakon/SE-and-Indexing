<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field programmable 
gate array (FPGA) and the semiconductor integrated circuit 
thereof. The circuits using a programmable array have been 
developed as ASIC (application specified ICs), that is, as 
small-quantity products or trial products. Conventionally, 
the typical circuits using the programmable array are GAs 
(gate arrays) and SCs (standard cells) customised from the 
mask level so as to satisfy the specifications required by 
the user, or PLAs (programmable logic arrays) customized 
by the user itself. In the case of the SCs, logic circuit 
blocks used in an LSI(Large Scale Integration) are previously 
registered in a computer, and products required by 
the user are designed by arranging and connecting these 
logic circuit blocks through the automatic processing by 
use of the computer. Further, in the case of the GAs, 
basic circuits for constituting logic gates are previously 
formed into an array pattern on a semiconductor substrate, 
and the user manufactures any desired LSI by deciding the 
wiring pattern using an automatic wiring software in the 
same way as with the case of the standard cells. The 
above-mentioned methods have such advantages that the 
period required for development is relatively short, as 
compared with the ordinary LSI which is totally designed 
from the beginning. In these methods, however, there still 
exists a problem in that it takes several weeks or several 
months from the design end to the production completion, 
because the manufacturing process is still required after 
the user has finished the design by the automatic wiring  
 
software. In other words, in the case of the GAs and SCs, 
although there exists such an advantage that any required 
circuits can be realized, a long development period is 
needed and thereby the development cost is relatively 
higher than that of the PLAs. In contrast with this, in 
the case of the PLAs, although the cost is low and the 
development period is short, there exists a limit in the 
actually realizable circuits. To overcome the shortcomings involved in both the 
circuit devices, recently, a circuit device referred to as 
FPGA (field programmable gate array) has been developed, 
by which any given circuits (as with the case of the GAs) 
can be developed by the user (as with the case of the 
PLAs). In this FPGA, there are previously arranged basic 
cells (each composed of a single of or a plurality of 
transistors), interconnections for connecting these basic 
cells, and programmable
