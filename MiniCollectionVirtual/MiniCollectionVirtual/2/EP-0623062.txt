<ABSTRACT>
A punching arrangement (24) has a guide assembly (56) for guiding movement of a second die (50) at an acute angle "A" relative to a first die (36) in order to punch an aperture (22) at an acute angle "a" in a flange of a track shoe (18). A positioning device moves the track shoe (18) to a preselected location relative to the first die (36) in response to movement of the second die (50) toward the first die (36). A holding apparatus (98) engages the track shoe (18) and clamps the track shoe (18) to the first die (36) in response to further movement of the second die (50) toward the first die (36). A crank mechanism (140) breaks the second die (50) away from binding engagement with the track shoe (18) after punching and enables the second die (50) to return to the initial position. The punching arrangement (24) is particularly suited for use in a punching press (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an
arrangement for punching an aperture in a member at an
acute angle relative to a first side of the member,
and more particularly to a die punching arrangement
for positioning and holding a track shoe at a
preselected location relative to a first die and for
guiding angular movement of a second die relative to
the first side of the track shoe.In the manufacture of track shoes for use on
track type tractors and the like it is necessary to
provide a pair of clearance notches in the leading
edge of the shoe to avoid interference between the
track and shoe as the track moves about the drive
sprocket and idler wheels. To maximize the strength
and surface area of the shoe the notches are disposed
at an acute angle relative to a first side of the
shoe.It has been a past practice to cut the
notches in the shoe with a cutting torch of
conventional design and type. The cutting torch is
robot controlled in order to maintain a reasonable
degree of consistency in the cut between piece parts
and to try and maintain the manufacturing tolerance of
each notch within specification. This method of
manufacture tends to be less accurate than desired and
based on its limitations requires more lenient
tolerances than desired. A tolerance range as large
as 3 millimeters is not uncommon. Even with the 
lenient tolerances a substantial number of track shoes
end up scrapped.The time required to cut a notch in a track
shoe using a cutting torch is substantial due to the
thickness of the material being cut and variations in
the material composition. As a result the finished
track shoe is relatively expensive.Machining of the track shoe by conventional
methods, such as cutting the shoe to length and boring
mounting bolt holes in the shoe, is done prior to heat
treating. The notches are easiest burned in the shoe
after heat treating. Thus, the desired sequence of
operations, machining prior to heat treating, is not
feasible.Punching or piercing apertures normal to the
surface of a steel material has been known for quite
some time.The present invention is directed to
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth
above. Regarding the prior art attention is drawn more specifically
to EP-A-0 484 588 which discloses a die punching arrangement
as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.In accordance with the present invention a die punching
arrangement as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 is
characterized by the features referred to in the
characterizing portion of claim 1. Preferred embodiments
