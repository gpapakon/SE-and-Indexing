<ABSTRACT>
This sensor is used for the selective detection or measurement of at least one substance present in an aqueous solution. It comprises at least two electrically conducting electrodes (7) which are insulated from one another and can be connected to a data acquisition device, and a sensor membrane which is sensitive to the substances to be detected and is composed of an enzyme/mediator combination is produced on a flat support (1) in the form of a plurality of single membranes (2) arranged in line- or matrix-form.

A sensor for selectively detecting or measuring at least one
substance component in an aqueous solution, having at least two electrically

conducting electrodes (7) which are insulated from each other and which are
connectable to a data acquisition device (4). and a sensor membrane which is

sensitive for the substance component to be detected and which is provided
on a flat carrier (1) in the form of a plurality of individual membranes (2)

arranged in a line-like or matrix-like configuration, characterised in that
arranged on the individual membranes are means, in the form of an absorption

fleece (6), for optimising the distribution of the aqueous solution to be

measured.
A sensor according to claim 1 characterised in that the individual
membranes (2) are covered over by a removable protective layer (3) for

protection from external influences, preferably a metal foil.
A sensor according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the
absorption fleece (6) is a nylon mesh.
A sensor according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that a
calibration fluid (5). preferably a neutral salt solution, is provided

between the individual membranes (2) or the means arranged thereon for
optimising the distribution of the aqueous solution to be measured, and the

protective layer (3).
A sensor according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the individual membranes (2) contain an enzyme which is sensitive to the

component to be detected.
A sensor according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the individual membranes (2) contain a mediator in addition to the enzyme. 
A sensor according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that
the individual membranes (2) are sensitive to physiological substances,

preferably glucpse, in the body fluid.
A sensor according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that
the electrodes (7) comprise three electrodes which are insulated from each

other, a working electrode, a control electrode and a reference electrode,
the latter preferably comprising silver.
