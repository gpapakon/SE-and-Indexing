<ABSTRACT>
The two telescopic thrust cylinders (rams, jacks) (6) which control the orientation of the tool-holder rod (1) are attached to the wall (4) of the fixed casing with the aid of ball joints (swivels) (7) located in the plane transverse to the said rod (1) which passes through the centre (5') of the articulated connection (5) supporting the said rod.

Marking device for making two-dimensional 
identification signs on the surface (3) of any 

article, of the type in which the micro-percussion 
tool (2) is carried axially by an orientatable spindle 

(1), which is angularly retained according to its axis 
and which penetrates into a fixed housing (4) through 

an articulated connection (5) permitting its free 
orientation in all directions relative to an axis of 

symmetry (X-X'), control of the orientation of this 
spindle being operated by means of two telescopic 

jacks (6), which are orientated substantially parallel 
to the axis of the spindle (1) and one end of which is 

attached by a ball-and-socket joint (8) to one or 
other of the two arms (9), which are perpendicular to 

each other, radially integral with the spindle and 
disposed in a transverse plane to the axis of the 

spindle (1), while the opposite end is attached, in 
turn, to the housing (4) by ball-and-socket joints 

(7), characterised in that the ball-and-socket joints 
(7), ensuring the attachment of the telescopic jacks 

to the housing, are disposed in the transverse plane 
to the axis of symmetry (X-X') which passes through 

the centre (5') of the articulated connection (5).
