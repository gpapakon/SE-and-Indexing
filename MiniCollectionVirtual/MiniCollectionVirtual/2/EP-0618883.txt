<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing hazardous fluid waste material from a body of water by exposing a carrier (10) containing a porous bladder (20) filled with sorbent material to the waste and then removing said carrier (10). The exposed bladder (20) may be removed from the carrier (10) for disposal of the waste. The carrier (10) may be recharged with a fresh bladder (20) and reused. An apparatus for removing hazardous fluid waste material having a carrier (10) for a porous bladder (20) filled with sorbent material such as waterfowl feathers. The carrier (10) is fabricated to allow the removal of an exposed bladder (20) and refilling with a fresh bladder (20) without removal of the apparatus from the surface of the water while still containing the pool of hazardous waste. The carrier (10) may be fabricated of flexible (40) or rigid (60) mesh material. An adhesive coating may be applied to the bladder (20) to aid in containment of the sorbent material within the bladder (20) especially during handling. An adhesive may be applied to a brick (700) of sorbent material to hold it together while used as above or the brick may be used without a carrier (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
L ABSORPTION METHOD AND APPARATUS UTILIZING A REPLACEABLE BLADDER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates generally to clean-up of hazardous fluid waste material including that containing oil or petroleum products, and removal of such hazardous fluid waste material from the top surface of bodies of water or from dry land, and more particularly, to the use of oleophilic sorbent material such as waterfowl feathers contained in or formed as a porous bladder and insertably removable from within a reusable mesh carrier apparatus or used without a carrier. The bladder may be formed with a mesh and contained therein with a spray of adhesive; or the bladder may be formed brick shaped without the mesh in which case the sorbent material is held together as a brick with only adhesive. This application is a similar to PCT/US91/07298 but contains new matter not contained therein and is filed as a continuation in part of that application which is abandoned upon the filing of this application and the granting of a priority date. Description of the Prior Art A U.S. Patent 4,919,820 ('820) discloses a method of removing oil from a body of water by means of an apparatus constructed of flexible mesh container filled with duck feathers. Said apparatus, as a whole, being removably insertable into the contaminated water. The apparatus disclosed in '820 worked well for the intended purpose of rapid removal of petroleum from water bodies after an oil spill, but it did require some storage space for the apparatus. Further, for the ap- paratus to be reused, the entire apparatus had to be removed from the body of water, routed through a device to squeeze out the absorbed oil and then reinserted into the body of water. During the time the apparatus was out of the water, the oil slick was unconfined and could spread. *820 attempted to solve this problem by providing a second apparatus parallel to the first apparatus which would con- 

 fine the oil slick while the first apparatus was being removed. The first apparatus would then be reinserted into the water behind the second apparatus - a difficult feat of topology if performed from a small service boat. Further, the disposal of the entire '820 ap- paratus continues to be an unsolved problem in view of the considerable size of the used apparatus saturated with oil and having a percentage of the apparatus which may be Ïƒom- posed of non-biodegradable material such as fiber glass mesh coated with polyvinyl resin. The used *820 apparatus could present a
