the breather hole (4) and provided with sloping 
surfaces (16) for cooperating with anchoring fins 

(14) on the plug (8) with a substantially L-shaped 
profile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
collecting tank made of plastics material for heat 
exchangers for motor-vehicles, provided with a 
breather hole and a removable plug for closing the 
hole. In the solutions known hitherto, the plug 
is secured in the relative seat, provided in 
correspondence with the breather hole, by means of 
a thread. With respect to plastics components, 
producing a thread in correspondence with the 
breather hole of the tank and on the plug involves 
considerable complications with respect to the 
moulds for constructing these components. In fact, 
having to provide a thread on an injection-moulded 
plastics part requires components which 
can move helically in the moulds which, in addition 
to rendering the moulds more expensive and complex, 
require constant maintenance and constitute a 
critical aspect in relation to the quality of the 
product.  In order to overcome the above 
disadvantages, the subject of the present 
invention is a collecting tank of the type 
described above, characterised in that, in 
correspondence with the breather hole, the tank is 
provided with an annular flange perpendicular to 
the axis of the breather hole and provided with 
sloping surfaces for cooperating with anchoring 
fins on the plug with a substantially L-shaped 
profile. Further characteristics and advantages of 
the present invention will become clear from the 
following detailed description, given purely by 
way of non-limiting example, with reference to the 
appended drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a partial side elevation 
view of a collecting tank according to the present 
invention; Figure 2 is a partial section along the 
line II-II of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a section on enlarged scale 
along the lines III-III and IV-IV of Figure 1, 
with the plug inserted in the relative seat;  Figure 4 is a view of the plug 
according to the invention, along the arrow 
V of Figure 3; and Figure 5 is a perspective view of the 
plug along the arrow V of Figure 3. With reference to the drawings, a 
collecting tank to be connected to a heat-exchanger 
network of a motor-vehicle radiator is 
indicated 1. In the example illustrated in Figure 1, 
the collecting tank 1, produced by injection 
moulding of plastics material, is produced integrally 
with a support structure 2 for an electric fan 
associated with the heat exchanger. One of the side walls of the collecting 
tank 1 has a breather hole 4 enabling the air in 
the heat-exchanger network to be evacuated when 
the cooling circuit is filled with

A collecting tank made of plastics 
material for heat exchangers for motor-vehicles, 

provided with a breather hole (4) and a removable 
plug (8) for closing this hole, characterised in 

that, in correspondence with the breather hole 
(4), the tank (1) is provided with an annular 

flange (10) which is perpendicular to the axis of 
the breather hole (4) and is provided with sloping 

surfaces (16) for cooperating with anchoring fins 
(14) of the plug (8) with a substantially L-shaped 

profile. 
A tank according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the tank (1) and the plug 

(8) are provided with stop means (26, 24) defining 
an unlocking position and a locking position. 
A tank according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the above annular flange 

(10) has two sectors separated from one another by 
notches (12) which permit the passage in the axial 

direction of the anchoring fins (14) of the plug 
(8) when the latter is in the unlocking position. 
A tank according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the stop means comprise a 

 
pin (26) provided on the tank (1), the axis of which is 

parallel to the axis of the hole (4) and a guide 
channel (14) developing in a curved manner which is 

integral with the plug (8) and can engage the pin 
(26).
