<ABSTRACT>
A method for making an improved pressure 
sensitive adhesive coated laminate is disclosed. The method 

involves coating a sheet having a release surface thereon 
with a pressure sensitive adhesive to form a laminate, 

drying or curing the pressure sensitive adhesive and 
marrying the laminate to the inner surface of a facing 

layer. A material comprising a mixture of substantially 
water-insoluble and adhesive incompatible polysiloxane (i) 

and water soluble and adhesive compatible polysiloxane (ii) 
is included so as to produce a low zero-minute peel value 

in the pressure sensitive adhesive layer is intimately 
mixed with the pressure sensitive adhesive prior to the 

adhesive being coated on the release surface of the sheet. 
The resulting laminate can be easily applied to a substrate 

and removed and repositioned or straightened, if necessary, 
and provides a superior increase in peel value over a 

period of time to produce a more permanent installation. 
The laminate is suitable for use as decorative and/or 

protective covering as well as adhesive tapes, labels, and 
the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of laminates
having an improved pressure sensitive adhesive layer. More
particularly, this invention relates to the method of
making improved pressure sensitive adhesive coated
laminates for covering substrates for decorative and/or
protective purposes or for adhesive tapes, labels, and the
like.The development of pressure sensitive adhesive
systems has resulted in their use in a great variety of
areas, such as, for tapes, decals, decorative and
protective coverings in sheet form for walls, furniture,
and the like, self-stick floor coverings, and generally,
for any purpose wherein it is desired to adhere an article
to a substrate.Because of the increased movement towards the so-called
"do-it-yourself" type of home improvements and
decorating, many articles, such as, wall coverings, counter
coverings, tile appliques, shelving covers and edgings, and
the like, are now sold with pressure sensitive adhesive
coatings thereon. Such pressure sensitive adhesive coatings
facilitate the application of such articles to the desired
substrate by eliminating the need to apply a separate
adhesive or to utilize another type of securing device,
such as nails, screws, staples, etc.One of the problems with such pressure sensitive
adhesive coated articles is that, in use, they are
extremely difficult to position and, if necessary,
reposition, even immediately after the application to the
substrate. This problem is particularly severe with
articles which are in the form of decorative and protective 
sheets coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive, and which
are used to cover substrates, e.g., walls, cabinet tops,
furniture, etc. Very often, such sheets or laminates
possess decorative patterns on the outer face and it is
important that the proper matching of the patterns from
adjacent sheets be obtained. Moreover, it is often
important that the seams between adjacent sheets be
straight, uniform, and parallel.Another problem which arises, particularly with
larger pieces or sheets, such as, when one is attempting to
cover a large piece of furniture or large wall area, is the
difficulty in handling the sheet and the avoidance of
touching of one area of the pressure sensitive adhesive
coated side of the sheet with another area of the same
side. When this occurs, the sheet will fold and the
respective touching areas must be pulled apart. This can
become extremely cumbersome, particularly with large
sheets.It also can result in removal of areas of the
pressure sensitive adhesive coating when

An improved method for making a laminate
comprising coating a first sheet having a release surface

thereon with a modified pressure sensitive adhesive to form a
first laminate, subjecting said first laminate to conditions

suitable to dry or cure the pressure sensitive adhesive, and
