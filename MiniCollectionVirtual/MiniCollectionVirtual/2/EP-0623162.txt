<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to working fluid
media for use in thermodynamic cycle systems. More
particularly, it relates to nonazeotropic mixtures
useful, for example, in refrigeration and air-conditioning
applications and having improved
vaporization loss characteristics.Commercial and industrial working fluid media for
thermodynamic cycle systems are fluids which are
generally either pure compounds, azeotropes, or
nonazeotropes (zeotropes).Many such mixtures are known in the art as
illustrated, for example, in the following references:

Petrole).M.F. Bouzianis, "Chlorofluorocarbons And Their
Alternatives" (Arthur D. Little 1988).D.J. Bateman et al., "Refrigerant Blends for the
Automotive Air Conditioning Aftermarket," SAE

and Refrigeration", 2nd ed. (American
Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning
Engineers Inc. 1991).Nonazeotropic refrigeration media ("NARMs") in
particular are attractive because, during the
thermodynamic cycle process, they absorb more heat
during the isentropic expansion (isobaric evaporation)
stage, release more heat during the isobaric
condensation stage, and do more work during the
expansion process or do less work during the
compression stage than do either single-compound or
azeotropic working fluid media under comparable
external conditions. In other words, NARMs have a
higher "coefficient of performance" (defined
hereinbelow) in an inverse thermodynamic cycle device,
and higher work efficiency in
