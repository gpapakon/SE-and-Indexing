<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a self-contained automatic 
temperature-responsive three-way line valve. A tubular valve 

member (18) is axially slidable between first and second 
limit positions for selectively directing fluid from an inlet 

port (12) to a first outlet port (13) or a second outlet port 
(14). The valve member (18) is disposed between a pair of 

opposed compression springs (29,30), one being a conventional 
spring (29) biasing the valve member to the first limit 

position and the other being an SME spring (30) which 
overcomes the bias of the first-mentioned spring when the 

fluid exceeds a given temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to temperature-responsive, three-way line 
valves, such valves being commonly used in fluid supply lines to direct fluid 
selectively to one or other of two outlets depending on the fluid temperature. In a system in which a fluid is required to be supplied at a given controlled 
temperature, a three-way line valve may be used to divert the fluid to a heat 
exchanger or other device if its temperature differs from the required temperature. If 
the temperature is within the required supply range, the fluid is directed straight to the 
end use. For example, if the fluid is too hot, the valve will be used to divert it to a 
heat exchanger for cooling; similarly, if the fluid is too cold, the valve will be used to 
divert it to a heater. A valve is known from Japanese Patent Abstract Volume 10, no 171 
(M489)(2227) comprising a valve body defining an internal chamber, an inlet port 
communicating with said internal chamber, and first and second outlet ports, a valve 
member mounted within the valve body for axial movement between first and second 
limit positions, said valve member in its first limit position closing communication 
between the inlet port and the second outlet port , and in its second limit position 
closing communication between the inlet port and the first outlet port, a first 
compression spring biasing the valve member towards its first limit position and a 
second compression spring opposing said first compression spring and biasing the 
valve member towards its second limit position, said second compression spring 
being of a shaped memory effect (SME) alloy and having a stiffness which, in the 
martensitic state of the alloy below a given temperature, is insufficient to overcome 
the bias of the first compression spring whereby the valve member is retained in said 
first limit position, and having a stiffness which, in the austenitic state of the alloy 
above a given temperature, overcomes the bias of the first compression spring 
thereby to urge the valve member to said second limit position However, this valve is a poppet type closing valve in which the inlet and outlet 
ports are all arranged transversely to the valve movement. An object of the present invention is to provide a valve having aligned inlet and 
outlet ports and in which the valve member is arranged to react quickly to 
temperature changes In accordance with this invention, a valve of the type discussed above is 
characterised in that said valve body is tubular and its bore defines said

<CLAIMS>
A temperature-responsive three-way line valve of the type comprising a valve 
body (10) defining an internal chamber (11), an inlet port (12) communicating with 

said internal chamber, and first and second outlet ports (13, 14), a valve member (18) 
mounted within the valve body (10) for axial movement between first and second limit 

positions, said valve member in its first limit position closing communication between 
the inlet port (12) and the second outlet port (14), and in its second limit position 

closing communication between the inlet port (12) and the first outlet port (13), a first 
compression spring (29) biasing the valve member (18) towards its first limit position 

and a second compression spring (30) opposing said first compression spring and 
biasing the valve member towards its second limit position, said second compression 

spring (30) being of a shaped memory effect (SME) alloy and having a stiffness 
which, in the martensitic state of the alloy below a given temperature, is insufficient to 

overcome the bias of the first compression spring whereby the valve member (18) is 
retained in said first limit position, and having a stiffness which, in the austenitic state 

of the alloy above a given temperature, overcomes the bias of the first compression 
spring (29) thereby to urge the valve member (18) to said second limit position,
characterised in that
said valve body (10) is tubular and its bore defines said internal chamber (11) 
which provides said inlet port (12) at one end thereof, said first outlet port (13) at the 

other end thereof in axial alignment with said inlet port (12), and said second outlet 
port (14) extending through the wall of said tubular valve body at a position between 

said inlet port and first outlet port,  
 
in that
 said valve member (18) is also tubular to enable fluid to flow 
therethrough and is slidably mounted within the bore of said valve body (10) for 

movement between its said first and second limit positions, 
and in that
 said second compression spring (30) is disposed at said one end 
of the bore of said valve body (10) between said inlet port and the corresponding end 

of said tubular valve member (18) so as to be within the fluid flow stream and thereby 
immediately responsive to thermal changes of said stream. 
A temperature-responsive three-way line valve according to Claim 1 
characterised in that the second compression spring (30) is a helical coil spring 

positioned to induce turbulent flow of fluid entering to the inlet port (12). 
A temperature-responsive three-way line valve according to Claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that the valve body (18) provides an internally directed retaining 

flange (32) carrying a thermally insulating pad (33) against which one end of the 
second compression spring (30) bears thereby to minimize heat transfer between the 

compression spring and the valve body. 
A temperature-responsive three-way line valve according to any one of Claims 
1 - 3 characterised in that a spider assembly (21) is located within the valve body (18) 

which comprises a spider support member having an imperforate central portion (22) 
and a perforate peripheral portion (23) defining a flow passage communicating with 

the first outlet port (13), and a retainer member (26) mounted on said central portion 
of the support member, said retainer member supporting one end of said first 

compression spring (29), and the central portion cooperating with one end of the
