Process for serial information transmission 
between at least two participants in a serial bus system, 

the serial information transmission being carried out at 
a sending transmission rate which is the same for all the 

participants, each information transmission being commenced 
with a start bit, each participant waiting for a 

bus monitoring time before sending an item of information, 
characterized in that, after receiving an item of 

information, a flag which indicates the reception of an 
item of information is set by each participant (ECU1 to 

ECU4), in that the logical state of the serial bus is 
sampled by each participant (ECU1 to ECU4) during his bus 

monitoring time (T
Ü
) at such a high sampling rate that an 
item of information is detected even while receiving the 

start bit (Sta), which was sent at the defined sending 
transmission rate, in that, after expiry of the bus 

monitoring time (T
Ü
), the state of the flag is enquired 
by each participant (ECU1 to ECU4) and in that the item 

of information is sent by a participant (ECU1 to ECU4) 
only if the flag has not been set during the bus monitoring 

time (T
Ü
). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the logical state of the serial bus is additionally 

enquired if the flag was not set and in that the serial 
bus is detected as free if an idle state "logical 1" is 

detected on the bus line as the result of the enquiry and 
in that the bus is detected as busy if an active state 

"logical 0" is detected on the bus line as the result of 
the enquiry.  

 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that each participant (ECU1 to ECU4) monitors the 

sending out of his information by "listening in", a 
reciprocal influencing of the information taking place, 

and being detected by the listening in, if different 
information is sent out simultaneously by at least two 

participants (ECU1 to ECU4). 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that, on account of the collision detected by "listening 

in", the two simultaneously sending participants (ECU1 to 
ECU4) discontinue their respective sending and reattempt 

to access the bus only after waiting times (T
W
) of different 
lengths. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the length of the waiting times (T
W
) is determined 
by means of a random generator and/or in dependence on 

the control device address and/or in dependence on the 
number of previous collisions. 
Control device, in particular a motor-vehicle 
control device, having a microcomputer, having a serial 

interface, which can be connected to a serial bus via 
which information can be transmitted by a process according 

to one of the preceding claims, the serial interface 
having means for setting a defined sending transmission 

rate, it being designed such that it commences each 
information transmission with a start bit and waits for 

a bus monitoring time before sending an item of information, 
characterized in that the serial interface is 

further designed such that, after receiving an item of 
information, it sets a flag in order to indicate to the 

control device (ECU1 to ECU4) the reception of an item of 
information, in that it includes means which sample the 

serial bus during the bus monitoring time (T
Ü
) at such a 
high sampling rate that it detects the reception of an 

item of information even while receiving the start bit 
(Sta), which was sent at the defined sending transmission 

rate, in that the control device (ECU1 to ECU4) includes 
means which, after expiry of the bus monitoring time (T
Ü
) 
enquire the state of the flag, and in that the serial  

 
interface is designed such that it sends the item of 

information to the serial bus only if the flag has not 
been set during the bus monitoring time (T
Ü
). 
Control device according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the microcomputer (µC) is designed such that 

it additionally enquires the logical state of the bus 
line if, after expiry of the bus monitoring time (T
Ü
), 
the flag is not set, in that the control device (ECU1 to 

ECU4) includes means which detect the serial bus as free 
if the result of the enquiry gives an idle state "logical 

1" and detect the serial bus as busy if the result of the 
enquiry gives an active state "logical 0". 
Control device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that it includes means which choose the bus 

monitoring time (T
Ü
) to be at least as great as the sum 
of a byte time (T
Byte
) and an interbyte time (T
Bmax
), the 
byte time (T
Byte
) being the duration of one byte of the 
information comprising at least one byte and the interbyte 

time (T
Bmax
) being the maximum time elapsing between 
two bytes of an item of information. 
Control device according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that it includes means for detecting a 

collision of information on the connectable serial bus.
