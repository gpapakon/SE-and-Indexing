<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a semiconductor memory with a built-in 
test mode which can freely change the width of parallel 

test bits. This semiconductor memory has pairs of data 
read/write (RWD) lines commonly provided for each block 

(lll) of a memory cell array laid out as a plurality of 
blocks (lll), DQ buffers (41) for each amplifying data 

output on associated pairs of DQ lines from an associated 
block and sending the amplified data in read 

mode, and writing data, written on those associated RWD 
lines, on the associated pairs of DQ lines in write 

mode. The semiconductor memory further has a test circuit 
which, in parallel bit test mode, enables those DQ 

buffers equal or greater in number than those DQ buffers 
needed for normal reading/writing to connect the associated 

pairs of RWD lines in wired-OR fashion and read 
out the results of computation of pieces of data, which 

are equal to or greater in number than the pairs of RWD 
lines, onto the pairs of RWD lines in read mode, and to 

write the same data on those plural pairs of RWD lines 
equal to or greater in number than the pairs of RWD 

lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory with
a built-in parallel bit test mode as indicated in the preamble of claim 1.Such a semiconductor memory is known from e.g. Proceedings of
the Symposium on VLSI Circuits, Seattle, June 4-6, 1992, no.-
, 4 June 1992, Institute of Electrical and Electornics
Engineers, pages 60-61, Toshiyuki Sakuta et al:"Circuit
Techniques for Multi-Bit parallel testing of 64MB DRAMS and
beyond".In addition US-A-4 510 673 describes a system to identify
each of a plurality of chips with identification data that is
both, human and machine readable. The chip identification is
used in sorting, storing, testing, and failure analysis.Still further, from GB 2 246 219 there is known a single inline
DRAM memory module that comprises DRAMS memories coupled
to four cross bar switches such that address portions and
data are provided to the DRAMs through the cross bar
switches.Recent dynamic semiconductor memories (DRAMs) have a parallel
bit test mode for performing a parallel test of a plurality
of bits in order to shorten the test time. This parallel bit test mode is to access a plurality of bits
of a DRAM even with a x1 bit structure, instead of performing
writing/reading one bit at a time to test the memory function
bit by bit, or to access more bits than the number of
inputs/outputs (I/o) for a DRAM with a multi-bit structure,
thereby testing the functions of many bits simultaneously.
That is, this test mode simultaneously write the same data in
n-bit memory cells, simultaneously reads the n-bit data in
read mode to determine if each piece of data matches with the
written data, and outputs "1" or "0" in accordance with the
matched/unmatched result.This parallel bit test mode can reduce the number of cycles
to access all the bits to 1/n (n: the number of bits) and can
significantly shorten the test time.A 8-bit parallel bit test mode that was standardized in JEDEC
(Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) has been
implemented in a 4M DRAM with a structure of 4M words x 1 bit
to which the parallel bit test mode was introduced first.As the degree of the integration of DRAMs was increased, the
number of bits to be simultaneously tested in parallel bit
test mode was also increased to minimize an increase in test
time. The individual makers tended to implement a 16-bit
parallel mode in 16M DRAMs with a structure of 16M x 1 bit
and implement a 32-bit parallel mode in 64M DRAMs.While the aforementioned parallel bit test mode will
contribute to shortening the test time, the
