<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides that an assembly can be fed into a pipeline or passageway to which a lining tube is to be applied. The lining is impregnated with curable synthetic resin, and surrounds an inflatable bladder, the bladder in turn surrounding a core pipe through which medium flowing in the pipeline or passageway can pass during the lining operation. The core pipe is of sufficiently rigid nature to withstand an inflation pressure to move the lining tube onto the pipeline or passageway surface by inflation of the bladder, but yet is sufficiently flexible and bendable so as to bend enabling it to follow curves and falls in the pipeline or passageway into which it is inserted. Specifically the tube should be sufficiently bendable to enable the assembly to be fed down a manhole and into the underground pipeline or passageway.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the lining of pipelines or passageways.This invention relates to the lining of pipelines or passageways, using materials
which are now referred to as "cured in place" materials. Specifically, "cured in
place" materials comprise flexible lining tubes including absorbent materials
such as fibrous felts, e.g. polyester felts which are impregnated with curable
synthetic resin such as polyester or epoxy. Whilst the lining tube is still flexible
and is so impregnated, it is held by fluid (liquid and/or gas) pressure against the
surface of the pipeline or passageway to be lined, so that it conforms to the
surface shape of the pipeline or passageway, and whilst so held it is caused to
become hard or rigid by curing of the said synthetic resin. The method of
curing may be any of a number of methods including curing by heat, curing by
radiation such as ultra violet radiation, or curing by ultrasonics. When heat is
used the inflating medium may be heated whilst in the case of light cure and
ultrasonic cure resins, an appropriate light or ultrasonic source is pulled
through the applied lining tube. Some resins such as epoxy resins cure
naturally, and are referred to as ambient curing resins, and these may be used if
required.Various methods as disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos 4,064,211 and 4,009,063
have been proposed for curing "cured in place" systems, including that the
lining tube, having been pre- impregnated, may be everted into the pipeline or
passageway, or alternatively may be pulled into the pipeline or passageway and
then inflated, for example by means of an everting membrane. Arrangements
have been suggested for effecting the impregnation of the lining tube whilst it
is in or whilst it is moving into the pipeline or passageway to be cured as
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,602,974. Generally speaking, the known methods comprise inserting the lining tube into
the pipeline or passageway so as to cover the surface of the pipeline or
passageway between respective access points of the pipeline or passageway,
such access points comprising for example access manholes, but frequently
complete lining of the pipeline or passageway between man- holes is not
necessary, as for example it may be the case that only a section of a pipeline or
passageway has a defect or is in a poor state of repair such as to require relining
by a "cured in place" method. The present invention is devoted to the
provision of a system and method for the lining of a section of a pipeline or
passageway.There have been
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An assembly for the introduction into a pipeline or passageway and for the
application of a section of said pipeline or passageway of a "cured in place"

lining tube which is impregnated with synthetic resin, comprising

a) a core tube,
b) an annular inflatable bladder which surrounds the outside of the core tube
and extends axially of the core tube for the length of said section,
c) means for selectively inflating and deflating the bladder; and
d) the said lining tube which surrounds the inflatable bladder and extends
axially for the length of said section,
so that said lining tube can be applied to the said section when the assembly
has been positioned with the bladder deflated in the pipeline or passageway in

register with the said section, by inflating the bladder, characterised in that said
core tube is formed in one piece article and of a construction which is of

sufficient rigidity to withstand the inflation pressure and of sufficient
bendability to bend round curves and corners around which the assembly must

pass in travelling along the pipeline or passageway to said section, and in that
with the bladder deflated the bladder and lining tube are folded to collapsed
condition and are held in such condition by temporary adhesive tape means

which release their hold upon the bladder being inflated.
An assembly according to claim 1, characterised by a transporter in the form
of a hammock having pull ropes at opposite ends thereof by which the

assembly and hammock can be moved into position into the pipeline or
passageway.
An assembly according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the core tube is of 
synthetic plastics material.
An assembly according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the core
tube is corrugated, and is reinforced internally in the corrugation by metallic

wires extending circumferentially of the tube.
An assembly according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the
core tube has enlargements on the ends thereof to prevent the bladder which is

in the form of a rolling pig from rolling off the end of the core tube at either
end thereof.
An assembly according to claim 5, characterised in that the bladder is
defined by a length of inflatable tubular material turned in upon itself to form

an inner side and an outer side, and the adjacent free ends of the inner and
outer sides are connected at one end to the core tube on opposite sides of an

aperture enabling the insertion of air under pressure in order to inflate the
bladder.
A method of providing an assembly whereby a section of a pipeline or
passageway may be lined by a "cured in place" lining system characterised in

that a length of lining tube impregnated with synthetic resin is arranged end to
end with an annular inflation bladder tube, which in turn is laid end to end with

a core pipe to which the inflation bladder tube is attached, and in
that the inflation tube when inflated is everted into the lining tube by pushing

the core tube into the centre of the inflation tube so that in the final assembly
the inflation tube surrounds the core tube and the lining tube surrounds the

inflation tube, followed by deflation of the inflation tube to form the assembly
for insertion in the pipeline or passageway.
A method according to claim 8 characterised in that the core tube is
provided with enlarged ends to prevent the lining tube from rolling off either 

end of the core tube.
