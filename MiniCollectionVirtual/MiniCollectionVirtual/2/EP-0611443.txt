<ABSTRACT>
A thin film pyroelectric imaging array (N, M) fabricated as a Si wafer. A thin film (40) of PbTiO3 is deposited on a thermally isolated bridge (45). The bridge (45) suspends the PbTiO3 sensor (40) over a preferentially etched cavity (70) in the Si wafer (10). Improved thermal isolation increases the responsivity of the sensor (33) to incident radiation. The pyroelectric sensor (33) formed can operate effectively at room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin film pyroelectric 
imaging array. Such an array is, for example, described in PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 9, no. 273 (P-401) 30th October 1985 & JP-A-60 119 426 (MURATA SEISAKUSHO) 26th June 1985, and, more particularly, to a thin film 
pyroelectric imaging array constructed from coplanar 
electrodes on a silicon substrate utilizing a platinum 
electrode suspended by four bridge supports over an 
evacuated silicon cavity. Integrated pyroelectric infrared sensors using PbTiO₃ 
thin films are well-known in the art. Prior art radiation 
sensing arrays have been constructed to sense infrared 
radiation using a PbTiO₃ thin film on a Pt-coated mica, 
silicon crystal or silicon membrane where the thin film was 
deposited by RF sputtering. Some prior art methods have 
employed a linear array sensor having up to 16 elements. 
Operating parameters of these devices have been 
characterized and are well known. PbTiO₃ has been of interest due to its ability to 
operate at room temperature. Room temperature operational 
infrared sensors can be used for such applications as 
remote sensing, biomedical tomography and gas detection. 
Pyroelectric infrared sensors enjoy some unique advantages 
over other sensors such as photon sensors. Photon sensors 
operating in the mid to far infrared region suffer from 
very low operating temperature requirements which do not 
provide the advantage of pyroelectric detectors which can 
be operated at room temperature and operate well throughout 
the infrared region. Pyroelectric detectors have small 
wavelength dependence over a wide infrared range and enjoy 
a fast response time. PbTiO₃ shows excellent pyroelectric 
characteristics because of its large pyroelectric 
coefficient and high Curie temperature. Prior art pyroelectric detectors have been constructed 
from materials such as PbTiO₃ ceramics and LiTaO₃ single 
crystals. The prior art employed thin film construction 
techniques to manufacture planar devices. Figure 1A shows 
a PbTiO₃ thin film device constructed with RF sputtering. 
The device has been fabricated as an infrared sensitive 
linear array which has a structure of PbTiO₃ thin film on a  
 
silicon substrate. The structures in Figure 1A have been constructed of 
a thin film of PbTiO₃ 110, a silicon membrane 160, a silicon 
dioxide layer 150 and an aluminum conductor or Au-black 
conductor 120. Substrates were created also from a mica 
sheet 140 with a thickness of 20-50 microns or a silicon 
single crystal 140. To thin out the
