<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a messaging centre management method for a cellular radio messaging system, in which a subscriber to whom a connection request is sent is liable to be temporarily unavailable. According to the invention, the said method comprises the following steps:     - the subscriber (1) is detected as being temporarily unavailable; - the said connection request is sent back to the said messaging centre (2); - the said messaging centre (2) stores a message intended to be delivered later to the temporarily unavailable subscriber (1); - the said messaging centre (2) automatically calls the said subscriber (1) back, according to a configurable recall strategy, so as to deliver the said stored message to the subscriber (1).   Moreover, the said step of storing a message is accompanied by a step of sending a short message to the temporarily unavailable subscriber (1) via a short-message service. Finally, the said configurable recall strategy consists in making an instantaneous attempt to call the subscriber (1) back on receiving a subsequent acknowledgement of reception of the short message, the said subsequent reception acknowledgement indicating that the said subscriber (1) is available.

Message handling system management method for a cellular radio paging system
in which a subscriber to whom a connection request is addressed is liable to be

temporarily unavailable, the said method comprising the following steps:

it is detected that the subscriber (1) is temporarily unavailable;
the said connection request is diverted to the said message handling system (2);
the said message handling system (2) stores a message intended to be delivered
in recorded form to the subscriber (1) who is temporarily unavailable, the said

message-storing step being accompanied by a step (63) for transmission, via a
short message system (SMS), of a short message to the subscriber (1) who is

temporarily unavailable,

characterised in that the said method also comprises the following step:

on receipt (64) of a recorded acknowledgement of the said short message, the
said message handling system (2) makes (65) an immediate attempt to call back

the subscriber (1) so as to deliver the said stored message to the subscriber (1),
the said recorded acknowledgment indicating that the said subscriber (1) is

obtainable.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said callback strategy also
consists in systematically calling back (66) the subscriber (1) at the end of

predetermined periods after the said immediate attempt if the subscriber (1), although
obtainable, is still unavailable,

   and in that the said predetermined periods are a function of at least one of the
parameters belonging to the group comprising:


the time;
the date;
the type of unavailability of the subscriber (1), that is to say "busy" or
"no reply".
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the said
callback strategy also consists in systematically calling back (68) the subscriber (1) at 

the end of predetermined periods after the point in time when it is detected that the
subscriber (1) is temporarily unavailable.
Method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the said predetermined
periods are a function of at least one of the parameters belonging to the group

comprising:

the time;
the date;
the type of unavailability of the subscriber (1), that is to say
"unobtainable" or "busy" or "no reply".
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the said
message-storing step consists in recording the said message in a storage zone biuniquely

linked to the subscriber (1),

   and in that the said storage zone is created (58) dynamically when, on the one
hand, no other storage zone is associated with the said subscriber (1) and, on the other

hand, the said message intended for the said subscriber has to be stored.
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that it also comprises a step for
erasure of the said message stored in the said storage zone,

   and in that the said storage zone is dynamically suppressed when it no longer
contains any messages.
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that the said storage zone can
contain two types of message, that is to say messages identified as having been

delivered to the subscriber (1) and messages identified as still not having been delivered
to the subscriber (1),

   and in that the said erasure step takes place after a discrete interval depending
on the type of message.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the said
callback strategy also comprises detection (55) of an auto-call by the said message

handling system (2), the said auto-call being a connection request addressed to the
subscriber (1) by the said message handling system (2) and diverted to the said message

handling system after it has been detected that the subscriber is temporarily unavailable,
 
   and in that a detected auto-call is broken (512).
Method according to Claim 8, characterised in that the detection of an auto-call
consists in, on the one hand, comparing the information contained in the "calling line

identity" field (74) and the "called party address" field (73) in the initial address
message (MIF; 71) accompanying the said callback to the subscriber (1) by the message

handling system (2) and having a signalling function and, on the other hand, analysing
the information contained in the "diverted call indicator" field (72) of the said initial

address message (MIF; 71).
Message according to any one of Claims 5 to 9, characterised in that the said
storage zone has an addressing number (84; 85) calculated on the basis of characteristic

information for the said subscriber.
Method according to Claim 10, characterised in that the said characteristic
information for the said subscriber comprises the telephone number (84; 85) of the said

subscriber

   and in that the calculation of the said addressing number of the storage zone
consists in:


windowing the said telephone number of the subscriber by placing a
justified window (81) on the last digit of the said telephone number, then
sub-windowing the said window (81) by placing [lacuna] least a first and

a second sub-window (82; 83) in the said window, the said addressing number being
obtained by concatenating, on the one hand, either the number contained in the said

second sub-window (82) (sic) or a reduced number derived from the number contained
in the said second sub-window and, on the other hand, either the number contained in

the said first sub-window (83) (sic) or a reduced number derived from the number
contained in the said first sub-window (83) (sic).
Method according to Claim 11, characterised in that the said telephone number
of the said subscriber comprises nine digits and is written ZABPQMCDU,


in that the said window (81) contains the number BPQMCDU,
in that the said first sub-window (82) contains the number BPQ,
in that the said second sub-window (83) contains the number MCDU 
and in that the said addressing number is:

either BPQMCDU, if the number BPQ contained in the first sub-window
is retained;
or xyz MCDU, if the number BPQ contained in the first sub-window is
replaced by the reduced number xyz;
or xyz abcd, if the number BPQ contained in the first sub-window is
replaced by the reduced number xyz and if the number MCDU contained in the

second sub-window is replaced by the reduced number abcd.
Method according to any one of Claims 10 to 12, characterised in that the said
characteristic information for the said subscriber is information contained in the "identity

of the first called party" field (75) of the initial address message (MIF; 71)
accompanying the said connection request diverted to the message handling system (2)

and having a signalling function.
Method according to any one of Claims 10 to 13, characterised in that during the
step for automatically calling back the said subscriber (1) the telephone number of the

said subscriber is calculated by the said message handling system (2) on the basis of the
said addressing number for the storage zone.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised in that it
comprises a step (54) for the subscriber (1) calling the message handling system (2) in

order for the said subscriber (1) to acquaint him/herself with at least one possible
message.
Method according to Claim 15, characterised in that during the said step for the
subscriber (1) calling the message handling system (2) the said addressing number for

the storage zone is retreived (510) by the said message handling system (2) on the basis
of the said characteristic information for the said subscriber (1), the said characteristic

information for the said subscriber being contained in the "calling line identity" field
(74) of the initial address message (MIF; 71) accompanying the said call to the message

handling system (2) by the subscriber (1) and having a signalling function.
