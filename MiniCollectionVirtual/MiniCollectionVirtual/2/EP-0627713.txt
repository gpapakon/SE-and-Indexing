<ABSTRACT>
Device for monitoring and controlling differential access to at least a first and a second compartment delimited inside an enclosure of a dispenser of products and/or services, such as to prevent [lacuna] to the second compartment whilst allowing access to the first compartment, characterised in that it includes means of recognition of an object identifying the individual and inserted from outside, the said means of recognition being able to communicate in an encrypted manner via means of dialogue with a central unit itself able to communicate in an encrypted manner via second means of dialogue with an actuator, with a view to controlling the latter, the latter being arranged inside the second compartment, the said central unit including means able to generate an encrypted message with the aid of a key specific to the central unit (mother key), the said actuator possessing means able to decrypt the said message in order to retrieve the said specific key, the latter thus becoming the daughter key capable of being used to generate at least one message for communicating between the actuator and the central unit and vice versa.

A device for controlling and giving differential access to at 
least a first compartment (3) and a second compartment (4) defined 

inside an enclosure (1) of a dispenser for goods and/or services, in 
such a manner as to prevent access to the second compartment (4) 

while allowing access to the first compartment (3), said device 
comprising: 


recognition means (11) for recognizing an identifying object 
(14) of an intervening person (13), the object being inserted from 

the outside; 
a central unit (7) with which said recognition means (11) are 
adapted to communicate through first dialog means; and 
an actuator (8) disposed inside the second compartment (4) 
and adapted to allow opening/closing of a lock (9) associated with 

said second compartment, 
 
said device being characterized in that said central unit (7) is 

adapted to communicate in an encrypted manner through the first 
dialog means with the recognition means and through second dialog 

means with said actuator (8), so as to control the actuator, and 
includes means adapted to generate an encrypted message with the aid 

of a mother key specific to the central unit (7), said actuator (8) 
having means (43) adapted to decrypt said message in order to recover 

said mother key, the latter thus becoming the daughter key adapted to 
be used to generate at least one communication message between the 

actuator (8) and the central unit (7) and vice versa. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
mother key is formed by a random number generated by the central unit 

(7). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
object (14) inserted by the intervening person is a memory card (14) 

and the recognition means (11) include a memory card reader (MCR). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the dialog means include an encrypting algorithm.  

 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that said 
encrypting algorithm is a DES (data encryption standard) algorithm. 
A device according to any one of claims 3 to 5, characterized 
in that the recognition means (11) are also adapted to check a code 

pertaining to the holder of the memory card (14). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that it further includes a memory adapted to record the set of 

operations carried out and the identity of the intervening persons.
