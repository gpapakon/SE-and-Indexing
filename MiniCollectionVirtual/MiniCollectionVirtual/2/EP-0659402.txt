<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel 
formulations and combinations of lipophilic and 

hydrophilic antioxidants and the use thereof in the 
therapeutic, foodstuff, dietetic, and cosmetic fields. 

These formulations are based on the use of carotenoids, 
procarotenoids and derivatives thereof with polyphenols 

of catechic and flavanolignane structures. Said 
formulations, containing a lipophilic antioxidant and 

an hydrophilic one at fixed ratios, can be used in the 
prevention of physiopatological conditions related at 

least partially to an over-production of free radicals, 
particularly aging, atherosclerosis and cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
formulations and combinations of lipophilic and
hydrophilic antioxidants and the use thereof in the
therapeutic, foodstuff and cosmetic fields. These
formulations are based on the use of lycopene,
with
polyphenols of catechic and flavanolignane structures,
both pure and contained in extracts.It is well established in literature that the
administration of vitamin E, Î²-carotene, lycopene and
ubidecarenone (Coenzyme Q 10) through the diet or in
pharmaceutical and nutritional formulations
significantly decreases the incidence of cardiovascular
diseases, and also it seems to play an important role
in the prevention of some tumours.
Dietetic and pharmaceutical compositions comprising both
lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant compounds are
known from EP 0 511 895 and JP-A-05139987. As far as the anti-aterosclerotic
activity of carotenoids is concerned,
according to recent studies, the capability of
carotenoids to prevent lipoproteins oxidation
(therefore interfering with the vasal uptake thereof)
appears to be one of the most important mechanisms. In
fact, carotenoids are incorporated physiologically in
low density lipoproteins (LDL) and, preventing the
oxidation thereof, they effectively counteract the
primummovens of the atherosclerotic damage, which
occurs mainly to the detriment of endothelial tissue
[1-4].Carotenoids are effective antioxidants at the cell  
level, their function taking place particularly on the
cell in active proliferation, in which the frequency of
genic error is higher. In support of carotenoids
bioavailability, the preventive action thereof, after
oral administration, against skin damages due to ultraviolet
radiations, which are known to give rise to
oxygen radicals, as well as the role thereof at the
peripheral level on the eye functions, are well known.Polyphenol substances having a catechic structure
of the dimeric and oligomeric types are widely used in
cardiovascular therapy and in ophthalmology due to
their action on large and small calibre vessels. These
natural polyphenols exert in fact a beneficial
modulating action on capillary fragility and
permeability, as well as on the protection of
endotheliums. Recent literature agrees in considering
the antioxidant activity an important mechanism at the
base of the biological effect of said compounds.Flavanolignanes, among which are silymarin and its
three main components (silybin, silydianin and
silychristin), are characterized by a marked
antiradical power at the hepatic and peripheral
