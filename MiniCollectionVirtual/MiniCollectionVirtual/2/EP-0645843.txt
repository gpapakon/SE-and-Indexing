<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal (30) is formed of a composite 
of materials where a conductive metal (22) has a laminated 

portion (24) thereon. The conductive metal (22) has a 
recessed section (26) which receives a spring metal (24) 

laminated therein, such the composite thickness of the 
laminated layer is uniform with the remainder of the 

contact. An electrical terminal can then be stamped and 
formed from the composite material, such that (36) is 

formed in the area carrying the laminated layer of the 
spring metal (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to an improved 
electrical terminal and a method of making the same, and 
in particular terminals having increased contact force 
added by an additional back-up spring. It is known to have electrical terminals which 
include an inner contact portion having opposed contact 
arms formed by cantilever beams, where a back-up spring or 
an assist spring is included having back-up spring arms 
which increase the contact force on the opposed contact 
arms for increasing the contact pressure to a mating tab 
terminal. In these known electrical contacts, 
manufacturing is made difficult by the inclusion of the 
separate outer back-up spring as the back-up spring must 
be assembled around the inner contact member. Normally, 
the back-up spring is partially assembled and positioned 
around the inner contact and then finally assembled to the 
inner contact member. In that these contacts are 
relatively small, the terminals are generally kept on 
strip form, while the back-up springs are formed on a 
separate strip and positioned over the inner contact 
portions and later formed around the inner contact. This 
provides a difficult assembly process and furthermore 
requires the usage of two separate stamping dies to stamp 
out the separate parts which adds to the total cost of 
individual components parts. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a simplified method of manufacturing an electrical 
terminal as described above. It is a further object of the invention to provide an 
electrical terminal which is more cost effective to 
manufacture. The objects of the invention have been accomplished 
by providing a method of producing an electrical terminal  
 
comprising the steps of laminating two materials together 
and stamping and forming the laminated combination into an 
electrical terminal. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be 
described by way of reference to the drawing figures 
where; 
Figure 1 is an isometric view of a prior art contact; Figure 2 is an isometric view of a strip of material 
formed according to the present invention which can be 
used to stamp electrical terminals therein; Figure 3 is cross-sectional view through lines 3-3 of 
Figure 2; Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional view through an 
electrical terminal stamped and formed according to the 
teaching of the present invention; Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view through an 
alternative embodiment of the invention; and Figure 6 is an isometric view of the strip material 
used to form

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing an electrical terminal (30,120) 
comprising the steps of: 

   laminating two materials (22, 24) together; and 
   stamping and forming the laminated combination (20) 

into an electrical terminal (30, 120). 
The method of claim 1, wherein the two materials 
comprise a highly conductive material (22) and a spring 

metal (24). 
The method of either of claims 1 or 2, wherein the 
spring metal portion (24, 124) forms an assist spring 

(40b, 136) for contact arms (40a, 140) formed by the 
stamping. 
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein 
the conductive material is formed with a reduced thickness 

area (26) along a portion of its length, and the spring 
metal (24) is laminated against the reduced thickness area 

(26). 
Electrical terminal having a contact section (8) comprising cantilever 
beam spring arms (10) which form opposed contacts for receipt of a tab 

terminal therebetween, characterized in that at least a part of each spring 
arm (10) comprises two laminated layers, one of the layers being of a 

highly conductive material (22) and the other layer being of a spring 
metal (24).
