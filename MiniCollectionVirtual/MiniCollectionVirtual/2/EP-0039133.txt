<ABSTRACT>
A vehicular strut type suspension system includes a pair 
of relatively telescopable members, one 60 of which is 

attached to the vehicle sprung mass 10 and the other 48 of 
which is rotatable relative to the sprung mass, and a helical 

spring 94 disposed around the relatively telescopable mem­
bers. The spring is seated on the other telescopable 

 member 
and bears at its opposite end against a retainer 98. A rigid 

bearing race 82 is disposed on the sprung mass and includes 
race surfaces 84, 86 parallel to corresponding surfaces 108, 

106 on the retainer. A dual function unitary bearing member 
114 is disposed between parallel surfaces on the bearing race 

and on the retainer and accommodates relative rotation bet­
ween the bearing race and the retainer, the spring and the 

other telescopable member. The unitary bearing member is 
fabricated from plastics material which exhibits increased 

coefficient of friction with increased surface contact velocity 
so that rapid rotary oscillations between the bearing race and 

the retainer are effectively damped.
