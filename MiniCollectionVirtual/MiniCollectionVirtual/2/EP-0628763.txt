<ABSTRACT>
An insulated liquefied gas tank comprises a gas tank (1), 
connected to whose inner surface are a plurality of 

elongate stiffening members (1a) and whose outer surface 
is covered by an insulation layer (4) which comprises a 

plurality of insulation panels (10). Each panel (10) is 
connected to the tank by a single support member (9) 

which is connected to an associated mounting member which 
is connected to the tank at a position corresponding to 

that of a stiffening member (1a). Each support member 
passes through a respective single hole (11) in the 

associated panel (10) which is retained thereon by a 
respective fastening member (15) located on the outer end 

of the support member (9). The hole (11) is larger than 
the support member (9) and a cylindrical member (12) is 

provided between the mounting member (6) and the 
associated panel (10) to protect the latter. Positioned 

between each panel (10) and the tank (1) is a pad (13) 
whose width is less than that of the panel (10) and which 

extends in the direction of the length of the associated 
stiffening (1a), whereby the panel (10) is spaced from 

the tank (1) by a clearance (c).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to insulated liquefied gas 
tanks and is concerned with that type of such tank which 
comprises a gas tank connected to whose inner surface are 
a plurality of stiffening members and whose outer surface 
is covered by an insulation layer comprising a plurality 
of insulation panels, each of which is connected to the 
tank by one or more support members which are connected 
to the tank and pass through a hole in the associated 
panel, the panels being retained in position by fastening 
members located on the outer ends of the support members. Liquefied gas ships for transporting liquefied gas, such 
as LNG, at low temperature typically has the structure 
shown in Figure 1, which is a diagrammatic transverse 
sectional view through a liquefied gas ship, in which a 
tank 1 made of aluminium alloy, whose outer surface is 
covered with an insulation layer 4, is supported by heat-insulating 
supports 2 on the bottom of the inner shell 3 
of the ship's hull. The insulation layer 4 comprises a plurality of 
rectangular insulation panels made of, for example, 
polyurethane foam. Each of the panels is supported at 
its four corners by support members, such as rods, 
extending from the outer surface of the tank 1 and fixed 
to the tank 1 by tightening a fastening member, such as 
a nut, on the threaded end of each support member with 
the interposition of a holding member, such as a washer. Fixing the panels at their four corners to the tank 1 
requires a great number of support members, holding  
 
members and fastening members, which results in a high 
cost and the need for much labour and time in mounting 
the panels and also in the panels and the support members 
themselves being stressed when the panels shrink. At 
joints between the panels, when the tank 1 which is 
cooled down by the liquefied gas to a very low 
temperature, shrinks the adjacent panels apply forces to 
each other at the joints and stresses are likely to 
occur. It is the object of the present invention to eliminate 
the above problems and to provide an insulated liquefied 
gas tank of the type referred to above in which mounting 
of the insulation panels is facilitated and the 
occurrence of stresses at the joints between the panels 
is prevented. According to the present invention, a liquefied gas tank 
of the type referred to above is characterised in that a 
single mounting member is provided for each panel, that 
the mounting members are connected to the outer surface 
of the tank at positions opposite to
