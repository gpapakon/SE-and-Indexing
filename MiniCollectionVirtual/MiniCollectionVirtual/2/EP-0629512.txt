<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a erasable and 
re-recordable recording media for forming letters and 
images by electric signals, and a recording process 
using such a recording media. In particular, it 
relates to a recording media and a recording process 
that can provide a reversible recorded image usable in 
printers, facsimiles, and copying apparatus, and is 
easily maintained and operated. Conventionally, electric photographic processes, 
thermal transfer processes, ink jet processes, etc. 
have been suggested and put into practical use as 
processes for obtaining hard copies. All of these 
processes, however, relate to the formation of 
permanent images and, thus, are disadvantageous in that 
they cannot satisfy the need for erasability and 
rewritability which is one of the aspects of recent 
various recording methods. In order to solve the problems, many recording 
materials utilizing photochromic compounds such as 
spiropyran, furgides, spiroxazine have been proposed. 
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
61-184536 describes a recording material using 
spiropyran. Such a recording material is erasable and 
re-recordable, but is a so-called positive-type 
recording material, and therefore has limited 
applications. Moreover such a recording material is 
very unstable when exposed to heat and light, and is 
difficult to use in natural light.  Therefore, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. 50-1732 discloses a so-colled negative-type 
recording material showing reverse photochromism, using 
spiropyran and color-developing by heat. Such a recording material is negative-type and has 
wide applications, but provides an unstable image and 
is substantially difficult to use in natural light. 
Moreover, it provides low color density, and 
insufficient gradation. This invention is to provide an imaging material 
that is re-writable, provides high color density and 
high gradation and is stable when exposed to heat and 
light. In order to solve the above object, this invention 
provides a heat sensitive color material possessing a 
substrate, a color material layer laminated on the 
surface of said substrate, and a protective layer on 
said color material layer, characterized in that said 
color material layer comprises 100 parts by weight of a 
binder resin and 0.1 to 30 parts by weight of an 
aromatic polycyclic compound containing a 9,10-diphenylanthracene 
structure represented by the 
following formula (I):  or a corresponding endoperoxide construction
