<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerant flow switching device for 
alternately conveying refrigerant from a high pressure (208) and a 

low pressure evaporator (224) to a compressor (202) of a refrigeration 
system, and a refrigerator using such a refrigeration 

system, includes a refrigerant flow switching valve (218) for 
alternately conveying refrigerant from the high and low 

pressure evaporators to the compressor. Said switching 
valve is controlled by a pressure switch (219) that utilizes the 

pressure difference between the refrigerant from the high 
pressure evaporator (208) and that from the low pressure 

evaporator (224) to cyclically open or close a switch assembly, 
moving the switch between low and high pressure positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to commonly 
assigned application US Serial No. 07/612,290, EP-A-0485146. The present invention generally relates to 
refrigeration systems, and more particularly to sensors 
also known as pressure switches used in refrigeration 
systems with multiple evaporators having pressure 
controlled autonomous switching valves for conveying 
refrigerant from said evaporators to a compressor unit. In a typical refrigeration system, refrigerant 
circulates continuously through a closed circuit. The term 
"circuit", as used herein, refers to a physical apparatus 
whereas the term "cycle" as used herein refers to operation 
of a circuit, e.g., refrigerant cycles in a refrigeration 
circuit. The term "refrigerant", as used herein, refers to 
refrigerant in liquid, vapor and/or gas form. Components of 
the closed circuit cause the refrigerant to undergo 
temperature/pressure changes which result in energy 
transfer. Typical components of a refrigeration system 
include, for example, compressors, condensers, evaporators, 
control valves, and connecting piping.  
 Energy efficiency is an important factor in the 
assessment of refrigeration systems. Increased energy 
efficiency is typically achieved by utilizing more expensive 
and more efficient components, by adding extra insulation 
adjacent to the area to be refrigerated, or by other costly 
additions. Increasing the energy efficiency of a 
refrigeration system therefore usually results in an 
increase in the cost of the system. It is, therefore, 
desirable to increase the efficiency of a refrigeration 
system and minimize any increase in the cost of the system. In some apparatus utilizing refrigeration 
systems, more than one area needs to be refrigerated, and 
at least one area requires more refrigeration than another 
area. A typical household refrigerator, which includes a 
freezer compartment and a fresh food compartment, is one 
example of such an apparatus. The freezer compartment is 
preferably maintained between about -25째 and about -10째C, 
and the fresh food compartment between about +1째 and 
about +8째C. To meet these temperature requirements, a 
typical refrigeration system includes a compressor coupled 
to an evaporator. The terms "coupled" and "connected" are 
used herein interchangeably. When two components are 
coupled or connected, this means that the components are 
linked, directly or indirectly in some manner in refrigerant 
flow relationship, even though another component or 
components may be positioned between them.
