<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is an intercommunicating device which can be used between two vehicle units which are connected to one another in an articulated fashion, having a bellows with a clamping device which acts in the peripheral direction of the bellows for fixing the bellows at one end with respect to the associated vehicle unit. The end of the bellows is held in a groove, running in the peripheral direction of the bellows, of a groove-shaped frame profile of the vehicle unit. This end of the bellows is held in the groove by means of tension using the clamping device. The clamping device is a clamping cable whose two ends are held at a variable distance from one another using a clamping lock. When the clamping lock is opened the distance between the two ends of the clamping cable is large and the clamping cable can be lifted over the edges of the groove-shaped frame profile while, when the clamping lock is closed, the clamping cable rests on the base of the groove, the end of the bellows bearing on it, and as a result cannot move over the edges of the groove and out of the groove. The actual clamping lock (8) is assigned a cable retractor (15, 16) with which the original distance between the ends of the cable when the clamping lock is opened can be reduced even by a predetermined degree before the clamping lock is activated. During the closing movement, the actual clamping lock produces the desired final distance between the ends of the cable.

Transition device which can be inserted between two 
vehicle members which are connected to each other in an 

articulated manner, having an expansion bellows (5) 
with a tensioning device which is effective in the 

peripheral direction of the bellows to fix the bellows 
(5) at one end with respect to the associated vehicle 

member (1), wherein the end of the bellows is held in a 
channel, extending in the peripheral direction of the 

bellows, of a channel-shaped frame profile (4) of the 
vehicle member (1), in which channel the tensioning 

device lies and fixes this bellows end under tension in 
the channel, wherein the tensioning device is 

furthermore a tensioning cable (7) of which the two 
ends (7a, 7b) are held at a variable distance from each 

other by means of a turnbuckle (8), that when the 
turnbuckle (8) is open the distance between the two 

tensioning cable ends is large and the tensioning cable 
(7) can be lifted over the edges of the channel-shaped 

frame profile (4) while when the turnbuckle (8) is 
closed the tensioning cable (7) lies against the base 

of the channel - laying the end of the expansion 
bellows thereon - and consequently cannot pass over the 

edges of the channel and out of the channel, 
characterised in that a cable grip (15, 16) is 

associated with the actual turnbuckle (8), with which 
grip, before the turnbuckle becomes effective, the 

original distance between the tensioning cable ends 
(7a, 7b) when the turnbuckle (8) is open can be reduced 

by a predetermined amount and the actual turnbuckle 
etab;ishes the desired final distance between the 

tensioning cable ends as it closes.  
 
Transition device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the cable grip (15, 16) comprises 

two clamping jaws (18, 19) which can be adjusted with 
respect to each other and which define a variable gap 

into which the tensioning cable (7) can be introduced, 
when the gap width is at its maximum, and is held by 

the two clamping jaws when the gap width is at its 
minimum. 
Transition device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the clamping jaw surfaces 

cooperating with the tensioning cable (7) comprise 
means to increase friction. 
Transition device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the friction-increasing means are 

transverse corrugations. 
Transition device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the corrugation crests of one 

clamping jaw are associated with the corrugation 
troughs of the other clamping jaw. 
Transition device according to one of claims 2 to 
5, characterised in that the clamping jaws are disposed 

in a housing (17) into which an adjusting means (20) 
for the clamping jaws can be inserted, which adjusts 

the clamping jaws (18, 19) perpendicularly with respect 
to the tensioning cable (7). 
Transition device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the housing (17) is part of a  

 
fitting which can be connected directly to a movable 

part of the turnbuckle. 
Transition device according to one of claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that a respective one of two 

identical cable grips (15, 16) is disposed on each side 
of a turnbuckle (8).
