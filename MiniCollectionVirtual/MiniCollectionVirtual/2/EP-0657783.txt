<ABSTRACT>
An expandable shell (10) for changing a belt-type photoconductor 
(1) in an image forming apparatus such as a laser printer. The apparatus has a 

two piece expandable housing (10) which captures belt (1) around the housing's 
inner wall. Guide features (21) are provided on each half of shell (10) to insure 

proper belt placement. Mating guide features (22,23) are located in the image 
forming apparatus. The guide feature (23) in the printer nearest idler roller (4) is 

linked to idler roller (4) which is movable toward drive roller (3) to facilitate 
changing belt (1). Belt (1) is captured in shell (10) when the housing is in the 

collapsed position. When shell (10) expands, belt (1) becomes free from the 
housing and is captured by drive and idler rollers (3,4) in the printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to image forming devices 
employing belt-type photoconductors. More particularly, this invention relates 
to a device for installation and removal of a belt photoconductor in and from an 
image forming device. When using a belt as a photoconductor in a laser printer, a method 
to replace the belt must be provided since the belt has a life shorter than the life 
of the printer. One previous method to accomplish this operation uses 
cartridges that contain the belt along with rollers and a belt tensioning 
mechanism. This is an expensive way to replace the belt, since many other 
components are replaced along with the belt. Other methods replace only the 
belt. With these methods handling damage to the belt is likely during 
replacement. Excess toner can also be held on the belt surface creating a 
messy operation for the person doing the belt replacement.  
 US-A-3 888 577 discloses a package for storing and shipping a 
closed photoconductive surfaced belt of the type used in 
electrostatic copying machines or printing machines which 
includes a carrier assembly for carrying the belt under tension 
during storing or shipping. The carrier assembly consists of 
two carrier units and a wedge member. When storing or shipping 
the photoconductive belt, the wedge member is arranged between 
the carriers in order to press same against the inner surface 
of the belt. For mounting a new belt on the roller assembly of 
the photocopying or printing machine, legs of the carriers are 
inserted in openings of the roller assembly to thus arrange the 
carriers and the rollers in a side-by-side manner. The wedge 
member is then removed to release the tension on the belt. In 
this position, the belt is supported outwardly of the roller 
assembly. After having removed the wedge member, a lower 
carrier is also removed. The released belt is then moved in the 
axial direction of the roller assembly. The invention is based on the object of providing an apparatus 
for installing and removing a belt photoconductor in and from 
an image forming device which protects the belt photoconductor 
during replacement until same is in its final position in the 
image forming device. This object is achieved by an apparatus in accordance with 
claim 1. A preferred embodiment of the apparatus for installing and 
removing a belt conductor in accordance with the present 
invention consists of a two-piece expandable housing which  
 
captures the belt around the housing's inner wall. Guide features are provided

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for installing and removing a belt 
photoconductor (1) in and from an image forming device, 

which comprises : 

shell means (10) being expandable between an expanded 
position and a contracted position and having an opening for 

receiving the belt photoconductor (1); 
the shell means (10) being sized and shaped to loosely 
conform to the shape of the belt photoconductor (1) when the 

belt photoconductor (1) is installed in an image forming 
apparatus and the shell means (10) is in its expanded position; 
the shell means (10) being further configured to engage the 
belt photoconductor (1) when the belt photoconductor (1) is 

installed in an image forming apparatus and the shell means 
(10) is in its contracted position; and 
shell expansion and contraction means (21-35,37) for moving 
the shell means between its expanded and contracted positions. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the shell means (10) 
comprises: 


a main shell body (11,12,13,16) having a top panel portion (11), a 
front panel portion (16), a bottom panel portion (12) and a first rounded end 

portion (13); and 
a second rounded end portion (17) being slidably attached to the 
main shell body (11,12,13,16). 
The apparatus of Claim 2 further comprising handle means (36) 
being attached to the shell means (10) to facilitate placement of the shell means 

(10). 
The apparatus of Claim 3 wherein the shell expansion and 
contraction means comprises:  

 

at least two rail means (21) being attached to the shell means (10) 
at opposing points generally along a line in the direction of expansion and 

contraction; 
means (22,23) for receiving, guiding and holding the rail means 
(21); and 
means (24-35,37) for changing the distance between the 
receiving, guiding and holding means. 
The apparatus of Claim 4 wherein the means for receiving, 
guiding and holding the rail means comprises: 


a stationary shell guide (22) including a portion configured to 
receive and hold the rail means (21); and 
a slidable shell guide (23) including a portion configured to receive 
and hold the rail means (21). 
The apparatus of Claim 2 wherein the shell expansion and 
contraction means comprises: 


at least two rail means (21) being attached to the shell means (10) 
at opposing points generally along a line in the direction of expansion and 

contraction; 
means (22,23) for receiving, guiding and holding the rail means 
(21); and 
means (24-35,37) for changing the distance between the 
receiving, guiding and holding means. 
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the shell expansion and 
contraction means comprises: 


at least two rail means (21) being attached to the shell means (10)
