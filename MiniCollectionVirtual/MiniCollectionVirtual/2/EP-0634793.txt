<ABSTRACT>
A substrate (14), a heat slug (16) with an access cavity (30), 
a lid (18), and a heat 

sink (20) having a stem (40) are used to package a high applied power 
VLSI die (12). The 

substrate comprises a stepped housing cavity at its center, and a number of 
electrical contacts (24) disposed at its underside. The inactive side 

(42) of the high 
applied power VLSI die (12), the top surface and underside openings of 

the stepped 
housing cavity of the substrate (14), the heat slug (16) including 

its access cavity (30), the 
stem (40) of the heat sink, and the lid (18) are coordinated in their 

sizes and geometric 
locations in view of the applied power and the heat transfer efficiency of the 

heat sink. As a result, sufficient heat is directly transferred away from the high 
applied power VLSI die through only one layer of thermal adhesive material, 

thereby keeping the temperature in the stepped housing cavity of the substrate 
from rising above an unacceptable threshold, and yet the semiconductor 

package can still be assembled using industry standard unmodified wire 
bonding and surface mount equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor 
packaging, in particular, surface mountable packaging. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to packaging a high power very large scale integration 
(VLSI) semiconductor die in a thermally efficient and surface mountable manner. Surface mountable semiconductor packages including the relatively 
new ball grid array (BGA) packages are well known in the art of semiconductor 
packaging. The relatively new BGA packages take advantage of the more 
traditional pin grid array (PGA) design and surface mountable technology. 
Typically, a basic surface mountable semiconductor package comprises a VLSI 
die, a substrate, a heat slug, a lid, and a heat sink. The substrate has a stepped 
cavity at its center, and electrical contacts at its underside. The electrical contacts 
may be in either PGA or BGA format. The heat slug is first attached to the top side 
of the substrate using an adhesive material. The inactive side of the VLSI die is 
then attached to the underside of the heat slug using a first film of thermal 
adhesive, and the leads of the VLSI die are wire bonded to the substrate. Then 
the lid is attached to the cavity opening at the underside of the substrate 
protecting the active side of the VLSI die. The semiconductor package is then 
surface mounted to a printed Wiring board (PWB) by joining the electrical contacts 
at the underside with complementary electrical contacts at a land pattern on the  
 
PWB. Lastly, the heat sink is attached to the top side of the heat slug with a 
second layer of thermal adhesive material. Although thermal adhesive materials are used to attach the inactive 
side of the VLSI die and the heat sink to opposite sides the heat slugs, 
experience has shown that each layer of thermal adhesive material nevertheless 
increases the temperature in the enclosed cavity of the substrate by about 0.5 
C/watt. Thus, for a VLSI die with 60 or 70 watts applied power, one layer of 
adhesive material increases the temperature in the enclosed cavity of the 
substrate by about 30 to 35 C. It is well known that heat generated by the VLSI 
die during operation is detrimental to the performance and reliability of the VLSI 
die as well as the neighboring electronic components. Various heat removal 
techniques including embedded heat pipes with air or fluid coolants are known in 
the art, and can be employed to lower the temperature in the enclosed cavity of 
the substrate. However, these techniques tend to increase the
