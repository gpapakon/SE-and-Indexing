 A FLOATING GATE MEMORY ARRAY DEVICE HAVING IMPROVED IMMUNITY TO WRITE DISTURBANCETECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an electrically programmable and erasable memory array device having a plurality of memory cells with each having a floating gate for the storage of charges thereon. More particularly, the present invention relates to such a floating gate memory array device having improved immunity to write disturbance.BACKGROUND QF THE INVENTION Electrically programmable and erasable memory array devices using floating gate for the storage or charges thereon are well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,698,787.In U.S. Patent 5,029,130, assigned to the present assignee, which is incorporated herein by reference, a novel type of EEPROM or flash EEPROM memory device is disclosed. In that application, the programming and erase operation can be selectively performed on a single row. However, although the programming operation is selectively performed on a single row, there may be undesired disturbance on the same column lines. In U.S. Patent Application 682,459, filed on April 9, 1991, which is also assigned to the present assignee and is incorporated herein by reference, another type of EEPROM memory device is disclosed. In that application, the memory array can be programmed and erased on a selective row basis. However, similar to the invention disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,029,130, because programming is 

accomplished by high voltage, i.e., greater than 10 volts, the high voltage may disturb the unselected cells due to the common ground line.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, in the present invention, an electrically programmable and erasable memory device of the type having a plurality of memory cells with each having a floating gate for the storage of charges thereon is disclosed. The device comprises a plurality of first address lines, a plurality of second address lines, and a plurality of third address lines. Each of the memory cells has three terminals. A first terminal of the memory cell is connected to one of the first address lines. A second terminal of the memory cell is connected to one of the second address lines. A third terminal of the memory cell is connected to one of the third address lines. The memory array device further comprises a high voltage source means for supplying a high voltage source with means for selecting certain of said second address lines for connecting to said high voltage source means to cause erasure of charges on the floating gate of
