<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a gate valve 
and, more particularly, to a gate valve capable of 
extremely fast operation. Many processing systems employ pipelines to 
transport potentially hazardous materials. Under certain 
circumstances, safety can require a rapid interruption of 
material flow and isolation of a hazardous condition. The 
gate valve is a device often used for this purpose and such 
use of a gate valve is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,103,863. However, prior gate valves have not been 
satisfactory under conditions requiring extremely fast valve 
closure and process material isolation. Such fast operation 
is necessary, for example, to isolate process materials 
from flame produced by an inadvertent explosion. Depending 
on pipe size and the volatility of the transported material, 
necessary valve closure times for explosion isolation 
generally range from 10-50 milliseconds. Because of 
the significant requirements for energy development and 
dissipation, conventional gate valves are not suited for 
operation in that range. The object of this invention, therefore, is to 
provide an improved gate valve capable of the extremely fast 
closure speeds necessary to isolate certain types of 
explosions.  The invention is a gate valve including a valve 
housing defining an inlet and an outlet aligned therewith; 
the housing having a planar inlet surface surrounding the 
inlet and a planar outlet surface surrounding the outlet and 
parallel to, facing and spaced a given distance from the 
inlet surface; a gate plate having a uniform thickness 
substantially equal to the given distance and defining a 
throughput opening, the gate plate mounted for sliding 
movement between the inlet and outlet surfaces and between 
an open position wherein the throughput opening is aligned 
with the inlet and outlet and a closed position wherein the 
throughput opening is transversely displaced from the inlet 
and outlet and an actuator for producing movement of the 
gate plate between the open and closed positions. Extremely 
fast valve closure is accommodated by the provision of a 
gate plate with an throughput opening and planar inlet and 
outlet surfaces that establish face-to-face seals in the 
valves closed position. According to features of the invention, the 
throughput opening is substantially displaced in the 
closed position from the inlet and outlet and the actuator 
produces on the gate plate a closure force having only 
components parallel to the inlet and outlet surfaces.
