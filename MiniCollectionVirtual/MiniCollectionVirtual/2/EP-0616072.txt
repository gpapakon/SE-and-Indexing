<ABSTRACT>
In the screening process for fibrous suspensions a partition (3, 3') with openings is used, through which the components of the suspension (S) to be screened are classified according to size. In this case, on the supply side (4) to the partition (3,3'), the gentle removal of the rejected components is achieved with the aid of flow vanes (7,7'), while on the passage side (5), pressure surges are generated by means of reamers (6), pass through the openings of the partition and prevent their blockage.

A screening device for screening pulp suspension, 
in particular for separating off impurities from an 

aqueous suspension containing waste paper, with a 
housing (1) for receiving the pulp suspension to be 

treated, which device has as separating element a flat 
partition (3, 3') provided with openings (2) which 

serves for retaining solids on the inlet side owing to 
their size (4) and which allows water and pulp to pass 

to the far side (5), with rakers (6) which generate 
hydraulic pressure surges and which are movable on the 

far side (5) of the partition (3, 3') at a distance 
from and along the partition (3, 3') and with flow 

blades (7, 7') movable on the inlet side (5) [sic] of 

the partition (3, 3') at a distance therefrom,
 
characterised in that
 
the flow blades have a pumping action radially from the 

inside outwards and their raking effect is less 
intensive than that of the rakers (6) on the inlet side 

(4). 
A screening device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the flow blades (7, 7') movable 

on the inlet side (4) are in the form of conveying or 
pump blades. 
A screening device according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the rakers (6) which are movable 

on the far side (5) of the partition (3, 3') have a 
hydrodynamic profile for producing pressure surges 

substantially transversely to the direction of 
movement. 
A screening device according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the distance (A1) of the flow  

 
blades (7, 7') located on the inlet side (4) from the 

partition (3, 3') is more than twice as large as the 
distance (A2) of the rakers (6) on the far side (5) of 

the partition (3, 3'). 
A screening device according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the rakers (6) belong to a 

raker rotor (8) and the flow blades (7, 7') to a blade 
rotor (9). 
A screening device according to Claim 5,
 
characterised in that the two rotors (8 and 9) are 

connected together and are driven at the same speed. 
A screening device according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the distance (A2) between the 

partition (3, 3') and the rakers (6) is between 0.5 and 
3 mm. 
A screening device according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that the distance (A1) between the 

flow blades (7, 7') and the partition (3, 3') is 
between 20 and 50 mm. 
A screening device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the partition (3') is in the 

shape of a circular ring and that the radially outer 
extent of the flow blade (7') is smaller than the 

internal diameter of the partition (3'). 
A screening device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the openings (2) are a plurality 

of cylindrical holes. 
A screening device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the openings (2) are a plurality  

 
of conical holes which widen in the direction of flow 

of the suspension. 
A screening device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the openings (2) are a plurality 

of slots.
