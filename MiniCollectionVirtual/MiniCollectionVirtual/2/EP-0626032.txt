<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of determining the rate of penetration 
(ROP) of a drill bit from measurements made at the surface while drilling. In the rotary drilling of wells such as hydrocarbon wells, a drill bit is located at 
the end of a drill string formed from a number of hollow drill pipes attached end to end 
which is rotated so as to cause the bit to drill into the formation under the applied 
weight of the drill string. The drill string is suspended from a hook and as the bit 
penetrates the formation, the hook is lowered so as to allow the drill string to descend 
further into the well. The ROP has been found to be a useful parameter for measuring 
the drilling operation and provides information about the formation being drilled and the 
state of the bit being used. Traditionally, ROP has been measured by monitoring the 
rate at which the drill string is lowered into the well at the surface. However, as the drill 
string, which is formed of steel pipes, is relatively long the elasticity or compliance of 
the string can mean that the actual ROP of the bit is considerably different to the rate at 
which the string is lowered into the hole. The errors which can be caused by this effect 
become progressively larger as the well becomes deeper and the string longer, 
especially if the well is deviated when increased friction between the string and the 
borehole wall can be encountered. Certain techniques have been proposed to overcome these potential problems. In 
both US 2,688,871 and US 3,777,560 the drill string is considered as a spring, and, 
the elasticity of the string being calculated theoretically from the length of the drill string 
and the Young's modulus of the pipe used to form the string, this information is then 
used to calculate ROP from the load applied at the hook suspending the drill string and 
the rate at which the string is lowered into the well. These methods suffer from the 
problem that no account is taken of the friction encountered by the drill string as a result 
of contact with the wall of the well. FR 2038700 proposes a method to overcome this 
problem in which the modulus of elasticity is measured in situ. This is achieved by 
determining the variations in tension to which the drill string is subjected as the bit goes 
down the well until it touches the bottom. Since it is difficult to determine exactly when 
the bit touches the bottom from surface measurements, strain gauges are provided near 
the bit and a telemetry system is required to relay the
