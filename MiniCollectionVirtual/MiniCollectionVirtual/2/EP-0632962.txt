<ABSTRACT>
Device consists of a driven shaft (12) located in space (7) between ends of two adjacent conveyors (1,4) and extending over full working width, and stationary vertical heated scraper plate (16) located below shaft. Plate supports shaft and removes excess material which tends to accummulate on it. Novel feature is that the shaft is held and supported on the plate by magnetic forces. Magnets (20) are located near the scraper plate and distributed over the working width. Alternatively, plate itself may be magnetised. The edge of the plate facing the shaft may be rectangular in shape, and the shaft is held centrally on its upper flat surface. This surface is pref. slightly dished. The scraper plate may alternatively be provided with two lateral support plates between which a plastic support strip filled with magnetic particles is located, the shaft being supported on its upper surface.

Apparatus to remove the liquid coating, especially chocolate-coating, 
deposited on the back bottom (9) of articles (8), 

having a driven shaft (12) arranged in the gap (7) between two 
cooperating belts (1, 4) and extending over the working width, 


wherein
 a stripper (16) is provided below the shaft (12), the 
stripper (16) being fixly positioned, about vertically arranged, 

supports the shaft (12), and cleans the shaft (12) from the 
taken liquid coating (11), and the shaft (12) is borne and held 

on the stripper (16) under the influence of magnetic forces. 
The apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein
 magnets (20, 34) are 
provided in the area of the stripper (16) and arranged over the 

working width. 
The apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein
 the entire stripper (16) or 
parts of the stripper (16) are made from magnetic material. 
The apparatus of claim 3, 
wherein
 the stripper (16) or the 
part of the stripper directed towards the shaft (12) comprises 

an about rectangular cross section, and the shaft (12) is 
supported and held on the middle of the upper surface (30) 

extending substantially horizontally. 
The apparatus of claim 4, 
wherein
 the upper surface (30) of 
the stripper (16) has a bed-like shape. 
The apparatus of claim 3 or 4, 
wherein
 the stripper (16) 
comprises two supporting sheets (31, 32) and a supporting strip 

(29) of plastic filled with magnetic particles is arranged and 
held between the supporting sheets (31, 32), whereby the shaft 

(12) is borne on the upper surface (30) of the supporting strip.  
 
The apparatus of claims 1 and 2, 
wherein
 the stripper (16) 
comprises two angular sheets (17, 18) arranged about symmetrically 

with respect to the vertical center plane (19), extending 
over the working width, and located with small distance to each 

other, and the magnets (20, 34) are provided in the space (21) 
between the angular sheets (17, 18). 
The apparatus of claim 7, 
wherein
 the magnets (20, 34) are 
arranged with distance to each other and have a shape permitting 

the flow of the liquid coating (25). 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 the 
magnets are provided in form of permanent magnets (20). 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 the 
magnets are provided in form of electromagnets (34).
