<ABSTRACT>
The golden decorative part of the present invention 
comprises a substrate and, formed thereon according to a 

dry plating process, an outermost coating, which coating 
comprises gold and titanium or iron together with 

inevitable ingredients in specific proportions. A Ti 
coating formed in an inert gas other than nitrogen, 

containing the inevitable ingredients may be disposed on the 
substrate, and a TiN coating may be disposed on the 

substrate or the Ti coating. The above golden decorative 
part having the outermost coating containing titanium does 

not cause allergic dermatitis, such as contact dermatitis, 
even if used in contact with the skin, and exhibits a 

uniform golden tone. Further, the above golden decorative 
part having the outermost coating containing iron is 

strikingly less likely to cause allergic dermatitis, such 
as contact dermatitis, even if used in contact with the 

skin, and exhibits a uniform golden tone. The golden 
decorative part having these advantages can be obtained by 

the process for producing a golden decorative part 
according to the present invention. 
The inevitable ingredients in this context are 
composed of at least one member selected from the group 

consisting of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golden decorative
part having no danger of causing dermatitis attributed to
allergy to metals, such as contact dermatitis, and to a
process for producing the same.Conventionally, the decorative parts, such as a
wristwatch band and other wristwatch parts, a finger ring,
a necklace and an earring, have been provided with a high
quality appearance and an excellent corrosion resistance by
composing their outermost layer of a gold coating formed
according to a wet or dry plating process. The respective
outermost layers of such decorative parts are now
increasingly composed of a coating of a gold alloy, such as
gold-nickel and gold-palladium alloys, rather than of that
of pure gold, because the pure gold coating is so soft as
to have less wear resistance, and because the color of the
pure gold is not favored due to its extremely deep golden
tone and rather there is an inclination that light golden
color is preferred.However, in recent years, a marked increase is
observed in the occurrence of allergic dermatitis in which
contact dermatitis is caused by the contact of the skin 
with a decorative part, such as a necklace or an earring,
made of a precious metal. Such allergic dermatitis cases
are reported with respect to almost all types of metals.
Especially, the occurrence of allergic dermatitis
attributed to gold-nickel and gold-palladium alloys is
described in many reports.Titanium is a metal for which no allergic dermatitis
case has been reported. However, the employment of
titanium in an ion plating process to form an outermost
coating of the above decorative part has been accompanied
by drawbacks such that the tone of the resultant gold-titanium
alloy coating is not uniform, and that the coating
becomes blackish. Iron is another metal for which allergic
dermatitis cases have been extremely rarely reported.
However, the employment of iron in an ion plating process
to form an outermost coating of the above decorative part
has also been accompanied by drawbacks such that the tone
of the resultant gold-iron alloy coating is not uniform,
and that the coating becomes blackish. Extensive study has
been made to find what causes such drawbacks. As a result,
it has been found that titanium and iron are so active that
large amounts of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen present in an
ion plating apparatus are captured into the coating, and
that the above drawbacks are caused by such capturing.As indicated above, there has been a strong demand in
the art for the development of a golden
