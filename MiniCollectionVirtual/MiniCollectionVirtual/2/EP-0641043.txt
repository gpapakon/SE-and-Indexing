<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) provides for selective 
shunting as between contacts of the connector. The 

connector includes a pair of vertically aligned electrical 
contacts (18, 20) supported within an electrically 

insulative housing (14). The housing (14) is configured for 
mating engagement with a like housing for hermaphroditic 

interconnection. The upper contact of the pair includes a 
depending deflectable shunt member (18d) and the lower 

contact of the pair includes a shunt member engagement 
element for electrically shunting the pair of contacts. The 

shunt member is deflectable away from the shunt member 
engagement element upon the mating engagement of the housing 

with the like housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improvements
in shielded electrical data connectors. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a compact design for a
shielded electrical data connector wherein electrical
contacts of the connector are electrically shielded from
other components of the connector.Improvements in the electrical data transmission
industry, especially in the computer field, have resulted in
the ability to transmit data along transmission lines at
increasingly higher data rates. Further, similar
improvements have also seen the decrease in the size of the
equipment used in the industry. In order to function
effectively with such equipment, the interconnection
technology, such as the electrical cables and electrical
connectors which connect such equipment, has also undergone
significant improvements. Electrical connectors are now
smaller and capable of transmitting data at higher rates
between such components.The requirement to make the electrical connectors
smaller necessitates putting the conductive contacts of such
connectors in closer proximity. However, when transmitting.
data at higher data rates, this physical proximity also
increases the cross-talk levels between such electrical
contacts. Accordingly, the industry has seen the need for
improved shielding within the electrical connectors so as to
reduce cross-talk levels in the smaller connectors working
at higher data rates. This is especially prevalent in
connectors used in closed-loop data systems which provide
for continuity of signal in a multi-component system when 
Certain of the connectors are not interconnected. These closed-loop systems employ
connectors containing devices which permit automatic shunting so that a closed-loop
connection is maintained even when a connector is in a non-connected condition. Such
shunting devices in these connectors render effective shielding even more difficult.Our patent application EP-A-0610087 is discussed later in the description.US-A-5052940 discloses a hermaphroditic electrical connector comprising an insulative
connector housing configured for mating engagement with a like housing, the housing
having a front end, a support member for supporting electrical contacts, and a rear end. A
pair of electrical contacts are supported by the support member. Each shunt member is
mounted on a particular electrical contact and in shunting engagement with a second
contact, until mating engagement of the connector with a similar connector, whereupon the
shunt member is moved out of
