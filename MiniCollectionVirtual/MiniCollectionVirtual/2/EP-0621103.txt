<ABSTRACT>
A superhigh purity gas supply pipe system adapted to prevent a semiconductor device 
of high cleanliness, into which a gas is introduced through a gas supply pipe system, 

from being contaminated with the metals or the like deposited during the welding thereof, 
and a method of installing such a gas supply pipe system. The superhigh purity gas supply 

pipe system according to the present invention is a pipe system consisting of gas supply 

pipe system parts having welded portions, characterized in that the gas supply pipe system 
parts having such welded portions are washed with superhigh purity water before, during or 

after the installation of the pipe system. The invention also provides a method of 
installing a superhigh purity gas supply pipe system having welded portions, characterized 

in that pipe system members are welded as an inert gas or a back seal gas is being 
introduced into at least these members, superhigh purity water being introduced into the 

welded members after the welding of these members so as to wash out the metal fume 
deposited on the inner surfaces of the welded members during the welding thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation for a 
super high purity fluid supply pipe system, and in greater 
detail, relates to a super high purity fluid supply pipe 
system, and an installation method therefor, which is 
capable of removing impurities such as metal and the like 
deposited as a result of welding, and is capable of 
preventing the contamination with trace amounts of metals 
or the like of highly clean semiconductor manufacturing 
apparatuses and the like into which gas or a fluid, such as 
pure water or chemicals, is introduced through fluid supply 
piping. Tungsten inert gas welding, arc gas welding, electron 
beam welding, and the like, are widely employed in the 
joining of fluid supply system pipes having welded 
portions, gas parts, or wetted parts. In such conventional 
welding technologies, no consideration was given to the 
burning of the weld surface, the surface roughness of the 
welded portion, or the deposition of metal fumes generated 
from the fused portion, and it was determined that 
corrosion and metal contamination occurred with respect to 
extremely active special material gasses. Furthermore,  
 
with respect to inert common gasses, as well, though actual 
problems do not occur over short periods of time, it is 
thought that there are likely to be reliability problems 
over a longer period of time. Using Fig. 7 below, the deposition of metal fumes, the 
surface roughness of the welded portion, and the deposition 
of chrome carbides on the surface in accordance with the 
conventional method of installation for fluid supply pipe 
systems will be explained in greater detail. Fig. 7 shows 
a welded portion of pipe materials welded by means of 
tungsten inert gas welding. In the Figure, reference 701 
indicates a tungsten electrode, and reference 702 indicates 
pipe materials which are subjected to welding. Reference 
703 indicates a welded portion, while reference 704 
indicates metal fumes which are generated at the fused 
portion thereof. These metal fumes 704 are deposited on to 
the surface of the pipe material 702 at the downstream side 
of the welded portion 703 as a result of the arc gas or 
back-seal gas flow, and become deposited metals 705. These 
deposited metals 705 do not pose the problem of separation 
with respect to inert gasses; however, under the flow of a 
corrosive gas, for example, hydrogen chloride gas, the 
deposited metals 705 adhering to the surface separate, and 
contaminate the gas atmosphere. The metals which separate 
have been detected
