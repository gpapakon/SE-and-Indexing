<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical wiring 
for information processors such as computers, exchanges or 
neural networks, and more particularly to an opto-electric 
integrated circuit which realizes optical wiring which 
delivers massive optical information at high speed through 
a free space. Recently, the processing ability of various 
information processors including computers and digital 
exchanges has remarkably been improved, which is mainly 
achieved by an increase in the density of formed 
semiconductor integrated circuits and hence a decrease in 
the propagation distance of signals through the 
semiconductor integrated circuits, which results in an 
increase in the processing speed of the semiconductor 
integrated circuit, based on the progress of semiconductor 
integration techniques in view of the fact that all signals 
propagate at a limited speed. Formation of a large-scaled integrated circuit 
brought about by maturity of such semiconductor integration 
techniques increases the number of wiring conductors in a 
chip or the number of output pins of the chip, which, in 
turn, increases the number of wiring conductors in the 
substrate and between the substrate and the devices on the 
substrate. After all, an increase in the number of  
 
interconnected leading conductors in the whole system cannot 
be avoided. In addition, the problem of cross talk due to 
mutual interference of signals caused by an increase in the 
density of formed integrated circuits, and the problems of 
a clock skew caused by different lengths of the optical 
wiring conductors caused by an increased operational speed 
of the device, a delay of propagation of signals, 
mismatching of the impedances of the signal passageways, and 
insufficiency of the bands of the signal passageways have 
become serious. In order to solve such bottlenecks of the 
communication, optical wiring techniques are used which have 
the features including mutual non-inductivity of signals, 
high resistance to electromagnetic troubles, wide band of 
interconnected passageway conductors, high speed of signal 
propagation and elimination of the necessity of grounding. 
The methods of optical wiring are mainly divided into 
waveguide type interconnection and free-space type 
interconnection. The former includes the formation of a 
waveguide in a two-dimensional plane and optical 
interconnection of active elements such as semiconductor 
lasers, photodiodes and/or spatial optical modulation 
elements (in more detail, see published unexamined
