<CLAIMS>
Safety closure device for sealing off container openings, for example
inlet and outlet openings of mixer or reactor vessels, with a

spigot (1, 2; 25, 27) for attachment to the container and a
closure (3; 30) for sealing near the free end of this spigot and having

a plate mounted to slide radially with respect to the tubular spigot
and co-operating with seals (18, 19; 34, 36),

characterised in that

the plate (3; 30) is formed as a slide and seals (18, 19; 34 36) co-operating
with the plate (3; 30) are provided for forming a hermetic

seal, the plate in its withdrawn position lying outside the outline of
the tubular spigot being mounted to slide in the direction of the axis

of the tubular spigot (1, 2; 25, 27) on the outside of the latter.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the tubular
spigot (1, 2; 25, 27) has on its lower end a seal (23 ; 29) co-operating

with the housing (12; 30) and possibly with the slider plate (3; 30).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
housing (12; 30) containing the sliding closure is suspended in a

hanging manner.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
housing (12; 30) is suspended in a hanging manner through double-acting

cylinders (41).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
plate of the closure slide (35) contains an opening (38) 

corresponding to the cross-section of the spigot (25, 27) and is
slidable in the direction of the axis of the spigot along the latter.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that an
outlet tube (5; 51) is provided underneath the closure slide (3; 35)

and can engage in a sealing manner against the lower end of the
spigot (1, 2; 25, 27) as well as the plate of the closure slide.
