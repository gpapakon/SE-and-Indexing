<ABSTRACT>
A fold-down handle for luggage, briefcases, and 
the like comprises a pair of bracket members (10) 

adapted to be attached in spaced-apart relation to an 
article (A) to be carried and a handgrip member (12) 

extending between and pivotally attached to the bracket 
members (10) such as to pivot about a pivot axis PA). 

The handgrip member (12) and each of the bracket 
members (10) have abutting end surfaces (121, 101) 

lying in a plane perpendicular to the pivot axis (PA) 
and peripheral wall surfaces (122, 102) on portions 

immediately adjacent the end surfaces (121, 101) that 
are of elliptical cross section about common center 

axes oblique to the pivot axis (PA). The elliptical 
peripheral wall surfaces (122, 102) of the end portions 

intersect the respective end surfaces (121, 101) along 
circular edges, the centers of which are coincident 

with the pivot axis (PA). Accordingly, the edges 
formed at the intersections of the peripheral wall 

surfaces and end surfaces of the handle member and the 
respective bracket members coincide with each other in 

all pivotal positions of the handgrip member.

<DESCRIPTION>
Articles that are commonly carried by hand usually 
have a carrying handle to facilitate carrying them. 
Examples of articles that have carrying handles that 
come to mind immediately are luggage, briefcases, and 
boxes or cases for tools and instruments of various 
kinds (e.g., musical instruments, electrical and 
electronic equipment, photographic and optical 
equipment, medical equipment and so on). Generally, carrying handles are constructed so 
that they collapse or fold in order to reduce the 
overall size of the article and allow it to be stored 
or stowed more readily. In the case of carrying 
handles having rigid handgrip members, folding is 
provided for in most instances by attaching the 
handgrip member to the article by means of brackets 
having pairs of rigid posts spanned by pivot pins to 
which the ends of a handgrip member are attached. A 
commonly used bracket design consists of a metal base, 
metal posts, and a metal pin received in holes in the 
posts. Manufacture and assembly of such brackets is 
costly. Moreover, the posts protrude from the case and 
can harm soft articles, packages and boxes packed with 
them, such as in car trunks and airplane cargo 
carriers. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
foldable carrying handle of a rigid type that is 
inexpensive to manufacture, easy to install, and 
durable. Another object is to provide such a handle  
 
that is of a unique and handsome appearance. Still 
another object is to provide a foldable handle that is 
not likely to harm objects that contact the brackets. The foregoing objects are attained, in accordance 
with the present invention, by a fold-down handle 
comprising a pair of bracket members adapted to be 
attached in spaced-apart relation to an article to be 
carried and a handgrip member extending between and 
pivotally attached to the bracket members such as to 
pivot about a pivot axis. The handgrip member and the 
bracket members have abutting end surfaces lying in a 
plane perpendicular to the pivot axis and peripheral 
wall surfaces on portions immediately adjacent the end 
surfaces that are of elliptical cross section about 
center axes oblique to the pivot axis. The elliptical 
peripheral wall portions intersect the respective end 
surfaces along circular edges, the centers of which are 
coincident with the pivot axis. Accordingly, the edges 
formed at the intersections of the peripheral wall 
surfaces and end surfaces of the handle member and the 
respective bracket members coincide with each other in

<CLAIMS>
A fold-down handle having a pair of bracket 
members (10) adapted to be attached in spaced 

apart relation to an article to be carried (A) and 
a handgrip member (12) extending between and 

pivotally attached to the bracket members such as 
to pivot about a pivot axis (PA), characterized in 

that the handgrip member (12) and the bracket 
members (1) have abutting end surfaces (121, 

101) lying in a plane perpendicular to the pivot 
axis (PA) and having peripheral wall surfaces 

(122, 102) on end portions immediately adjacent 
the end surfaces (121, 101) having center axes 

(CA) oblique to the pivot axis (PA), each 
peripheral wall surface being of uniform 

elliptical cross section with respect to the 
center axis and intersecting the respective end 

surface along a circle (124, 104) having its 
center coincident with the pivot axis (PA) so that 

edges formed by the peripheral wall surfaces and 
end surfaces of the handle member and the 

respective bracket members coincide with each 
other in all pivotal positions of the handgrip 

member. 
A handle according to claim 1 
characterized in that when the handle member (12) 

is extended the minor axes of the elliptical wall 
surfaces (122, 102) of the end portions of the 

handgrip member (12) and bracket members (10) lie 
in a common plane with the pivot axis (PA) and 

center axis (CA). 
A handle according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized in that a body portion of the 

handgrip member between the end portions (121) is 
 

of substantially uniform approximately elliptical 
cross-section corresponding substantially to the 

cross-sections or the end portions throughout its 
length. 
A handle according to claim 3 
characterized in that the center axis (CA) of the 

body portion of the handgrip member (12) is 
smoothly curved along its length. 
A handle according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that the bracket members (10) are 

of substantially uniform elliptical cross-section 
along their lengths. 
A handle according to anyone of claim 1 to 5 
characterized in that the bracket members (10) and 

the handgrip member (12) are molded of a polymeric 
material. 
A handle according to anyone of claims 1 to 6 
characterized in that the pivot connection between 

the handgrip member (12) and each bracket member 
(10) includes a pin (125) affixed to each end of 

the handgrip member (12) and protruding from the 
end surface (121) along the pivot axis (PA) and a 

hole (105, 106) in each bracket member (10)

A handle according to claim 7 
characterized in that each pin (125) has a shank 

portion and an enlarged head portion spaced apart 
from the end surface (121) of the handgrip member 

(12) and the hole (105,106) in each bracket member 
(10) receiving the pin (125) has a cross-section 

matching the shape of the pin. 
A handle according to claim 8

a base wall (107) adapted to abut the article (A) 
to which it is attached and the hole (105, 106)

(12) is a generally T-shaped slot extending along 

the end surface (101) of the bracket member (10) 
from the base wall (107) to the pivot axis (PA). 
A handle according to claim 9 
comprising a keeper member (14) received in the
