<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an electronic device having a frequency dependent 
signal transfer characteristic which is electrically coupled to at least one SAW 

transducer. The SAW transducer acts as a SAW impedance element since it 
exhibits frequency dependent electrical characteristics. Such characteristics 

are utilised so that the transmission loss of the SAW impedance element is 
high in a relatively low signal transfer region of the signal transfer 

characteristic of the electronic device, and low in a relatively high signal 
transfer region of the signal transfer characteristic of the electronic device. 

This has the advantage that signals outside of the passband of the electronic 
device can be attenuated without increasing the transmission loss of the 

electronic device in its passband.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic device having a frequency dependent
signal transfer characteristic. In particular, it relates to an electronic device
which is electrically coupled to at least one SAW transducer.SAW technology is increasingly finding more and more applications in the
electronics and RF art. Due to the fact that SAW wavelengths are typically
105 times shorter than those of electromagnetic waves, SAW technology is
finding particular applications where miniaturization is important or desirable.
One such application is the use of SAW filters in radio telephones, where the
typically small size and weight of SAW filters is highly advantageous over
conventional technologies, such as ceramic filters, lumped element filters or
the like. It is a requirement of such filters that they have low-losses, typically
insertion losses of 1~3dB.A typical example of a conventional low-loss SAW filter is a transversal SAW
filter in which SAW energy is transferred between two spaced apart
interdigital transducers (IDTs). The IDTs each comprise two sets of electrode
fingers which are formed on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. The
fingers in each set are typically all electrically connected together and are
interleaved (interdigitated) with the electrode fingers of the other set. In a
transversal SAW filter, electromagnetic energy is converted into SAW energy
by coupling the electrostatic field pattern of an input IDT to a SAW by the
piezoelectric effect.A problem encountered with both low-loss SAW filters, and filters utilising
conventional technology is that unacceptably high side lobes exist in the
stopbands of the filters. Hitherto, this problem has been addressed by
cascading identical filters or filters having identical or slightly different 
frequency transfer characteristics. However, such an approach typically
results in complicated filter design, requires space to accommodate the extra
components or extra tracks comprising the cascade of filters thereby
mitigating against miniaturisation, increases insertion loss and reduces the
passband of the composite filter relative to the single filter whose
characteristics it was desired to improve.A further problem with SAW filters and transversal SAW filters in particular
is that their maximum input power is limited due to the mechanical vibration
caused by large amplitude SAWs degrading the IDT electrode fingers resulting
in lower performance from the filter. Additionaly, conventional filters have
relatively high losses, typically greater than
