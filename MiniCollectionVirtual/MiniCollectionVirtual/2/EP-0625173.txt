<ABSTRACT>
A shaving aid for use with a wet razor comprising a water insoluble polymeric material including at least two different polymers, and a water soluble active ingredient, such as polyethylene oxide. One embodiment of the present invention comprises a flexible, polypropylene razor head, having a shaving aid bonded directly thereto. The shaving aid comprises a water soluble polyethylene oxide and water-insoluble polystyrene and polypropylene. Other additives such as pigments and skin-treating additives are also disclosed. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises the shaving aid molded onto a flexible blade support which is preferably formed of polypropylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a shaving
aid for use with a wet razor and, more particularly, to a
shaving aid having increased shelf life and better
adhesion to a razor head.Various types of shaving aids are known in the
razor industry. One popular type of shaving aid contains
at least one water insoluble polymeric matrix and a water
soluble material which exudes out of the insoluble matrix
upon contact with water during shaving. Such shaving aids
have been attached to razor heads mechanically, for
example, with snap-in fittings or by molding the shaving
aid into recesses containing anchors in a razor head.
When the thermoplastic material hardens, it is anchored
into these recesses and thereby secured to the razor head.
The present invention is directed to a shaving aid which
may be successfully chemically bonded to a razor head
thereby eliminating the need for mechanical securement.GB-A-2024082 relates to a shaving unit which comprises at least one blade,
and a blade support of moulded polymeric material which provides skin
engaging cap and guard surfaces in which the portion of the blade support
that provides the guard surface and or the cap surface being formed wholly
in part of a moulded mixture of at least one hydrophobic material and at
least one water leachable hydrophilic polymeric material such that, during
shaving the water present on the area to be shaved leaches out the
hydrophilic material which consequently serves as a lubricant in place of a
conventional shaving soap or cream. European Patent Application number 0348627A relates to a disposable
shaving unit having one or more razor blades that create a smooth surface
on the skin as a result of friction and contact with water without using other
shaving aid materials wherein the production of an entire platform and cap
section uses an injection process which defines a skin engaging surface
composed of a blend of water in soluble polymer in an amount of 50-90%
by weight that is polystyrene, thermoplastic rubber (with or without filler)
with or without polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyacetal,
water soluble polymer in an amount of 9-40% by weight and polyethylene
glycol in an amount of 1-10% by weight.In order for a shaving aid to be commercially
acceptable, it has been found that two characteristic
properties are very important. First, the shaving aid
must adhere well to the razor head. Secondly, the shaving
aid must be able to withstand extreme environments
encountered between the point of manufacture and the point
of
