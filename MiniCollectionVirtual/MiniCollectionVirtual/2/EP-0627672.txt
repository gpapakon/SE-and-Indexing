<ABSTRACT>
In order to insert a replacement toner dam (40) in an assembled 
toner cartridge (30), the opposing sides of the toner cartridge (30) are caused to 

move towards each other so as to deform the cartridge (30) and cause openings 
to appear at opposing ends thereof. A pair of web spring carriers (36,38) are 

inserted into and through the openings so they exit from one opening. A new 
toner dam (40) is inserted between web spring carriers (36,38) at the portion 

thereof that exits from the opening. The web spring carriers (36,38) are then 
withdrawn until the replacement toner dam (40) is in a proper position. The 

dam (40) is then held in position and the web spring carriers (36,38) are freely 
withdrawn. This method thereby enables replacement of the toner dam (40) 

without injury to seals at either end of the toner cartridge (30). Various non-adhesive 
bearing toner dam structures are shown, each of which has a flexible 

portion that engages a toner bottle flange and thereby enables a toner seal to be 
achieved without use of adhesive. Additional methods are described which 

require disassembly of a used toner cartridge and replacement of certain parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to replaceable toner cartridges that are used
with electrostatic printers and copiers and, more particularly, to
a toner dam for enabling reuse of used toner cartridges by replacement of toner
dams therein.Laser printers and electrostatic copiers employ toner cartridges
that contain a supply of toner material for use during the electrostatic
development process. The cartridges are designed to be replaced from time to
time, to replenish the toner that is used during the printing process. In addition
to an electrostatic magnetic roller assembly, a toner cartridge includes (see Fig.
1) a toner bottle 10 and a cover 12 that includes a charging rod (not shown).
Both toner bottle 10 and cover 12 have flanges that mate when cover 12 and
bottle 10 are brought together. A polystyrene gasket 14 overlays flange 16 on
bottle 10 and provides a substrate against which a removable tear strip 18 can
be adhered. Toner dam 18 provides a damming action for toner contained
within bottle 10 and prevents its leakage until it has been removed to render
accessible the toner in bottle 10. A pair of foam seals 20 are placed at either
end of cover 12 and act to prevent toner leakage once toner dam 18 has been
removed.During production, toner dam 18 is adhered to the upper surface
of polystyrene gasket 14 which is, in turn, adhered to the upper surface of
flange 16 of bottle 10. Top 12 is then brought into engagement, sandwiching
toner dam 18 therebetween. The elongated flanges along the sides of top 12
are heat bonded to the elongated flanges of bottle 10 to create a unitary
structure. Foam seals 20 are thereby compressed but enable withdrawal of
toner dam 18 at some later time. Subsequently, through a hole in bottle 10,
toner is inserted and the bottle is sealed and is ready for use. While toner cartridges were initially designed to be discarded after
the original toner supply was exhausted, other portions thereof (i.e., the
magnetic roller and charging rods) have longer useful lives and thus a market
has developed for cartridges that have been refilled with a supply of toner.
However, replacement toner dams have not been satisfactory as they have
enabled leakage of refilled toner. Furthermore, such replacement toner dams
have used adhesive to adhere the dam to the bottle/top flanges. Such
adhesives tend to collect toner and render the toner cartridge thereafter
unusable for refilling.
   In U.S. Patent 5,080,745 to Paull, a replacement toner dam is
described which includes a sealing sheet with an adhesive
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A toner dam (80) for an elongated-dimension toner cartridge
(92) having relatively narrow ends, said toner cartridge

(92) comprising a toner bottle and bottle cover, both toner
bottle and bottle cover having flanges encompassing openings

therein and a gasket positioned between said flanges, said
flanges and gasket adherent to each other along said

elongated dimension so as to align said openings in said
toner bottle and bottle cover, said relatively narrow ends

each having a resilient seal positioned therein, said toner
dam comprising:


a planar, rigid sheet having two major planar surfaces, said
rigid sheet sized to completely cover and seal said aligned

openings when inserted between said toner bottle and bottle
cover, said rigid sheet including resilient means, said

resilient means extending from one said major planar surface
thereof and positioned to directly engage and seal against a

proximate flange surface upon insertion of said planar rigid
sheet therebetween, said planar rigid sheet

comprising an enclosed, flexible channel (82) about a
periphery thereof, said enclosed flexible channel (82)

communicating with a compressible fluid-filled reservoir
(88) via a passage (86) having a breakable seal (90)

positioned therein, and further including means for
compressing said fluid-filled reservoir (88) to increase

fluid pressure therein to a point where said breakable seal
(90) is ruptured and said fluid is forced from said

reservoir (88) into said flexible channel (82), thereby
causing an expansion thereof to create said resilient means.
The toner dam as recited in claim 1, wherein said means
(94,96) for compressing said fluid-filled reservoir includes

a foldable portion of said planar, rigid sheet, said 
foldable portion positioned to compress said fluid-filled

reservoir (88) and further having clips (94,96) at its
extremities to engage edges of said planar, rigid sheet to

maintain a continuing level of pressure on said fluid-filled
reservoir (88).
