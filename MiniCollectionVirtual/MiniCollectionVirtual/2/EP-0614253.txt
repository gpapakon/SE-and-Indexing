<ABSTRACT>
A multi-quantum well (MQW) structure type semiconductor 
integrated laser element is constituted by a laser diode 

section and an optical modulator section which is integrated 
wi
th the laser diode section and which contains a 
multi-quantum well structure. The multi-quantum well 

structure of the optical modulator section is a coupled 
multi-quantum well structure in which quantum states of the 

quantum wells are coupled with one another, thereby forming 
mini-bands (7). The large amounts of carriers produced by 

absorption are quickly scattered and lost through the 
mini-bands thereby enabling the modulation in proportion to 

the intensity of the electric field for modulation. The 
MQW integrated semiconductor laser element thus obtained 

exhibits excellent modulation characteristics and provides 
high output, and can be fabricated at a low cost with a 

high production yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-quantum well 
(MQW) structure semiconductor laser element, and more 
particularly to a multi-quantum well structure semiconductor 
laser element into which an optical modulator is integrated. Recently, the studies on ultra-high speed and large 
capacity data communication and data processing systems 
utilizing optical techniques are rapidly advancing, and the 
availability of advanced growth techniques such as a 
metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) has stimulated 
the research and development of various elements such as an 
ultra-high speed semiconductor photonic element whose 
operation speed is beyond 2 Gb/s, a quantum well structure 
element, a surface emitting type semiconductor laser, and a 
semiconductor photonic integrated circuit (SPIC). The ultra-high speed semiconductor photonic elements 
include, as examples, a Distributed Feedback Laser Diode 
(DFB LD) and a Distributed Bragg Reflector Laser Diode (DBR 
LD). However, where the semiconductor laser is directly  
 
modulated, the spectrum width increases due to the changes 
in refractive indices in laser media that are caused by 
changes in injected carriers, and this results in the so-called 
"dynamic wave chirping". This wave chirping becomes 
a cause for limiting the transmission distance for high 
speed modulation, so that an external modulator which does 
not rely on the direct modulation has been proposed. The examples of the modulators using semiconductors 
include a bulk type modulator in which a bulk semiconductor 
is employed as an absorption layer and which utilizes 
shifts of absorption edge due to Franz-Keldysh effects, and 
a quantum well structure modulator which utilizes shifts of 
absorption edge are larger than in the bulk type modulator 
due to Quantum-Confined Stark Effects (QCSE). Another 
example is a Mach-Zehnder type modulator which utilizes 
optical phase modulation on the principle of Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer. Along with the fast and remarkable advancement in 
recent years in the crystal growth techniques, such as 
MOVPE (metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy) and MBE (molecular 
beam epitaxy), for growing thin films, it has become 
possible to form a high quality semiconductor hetero-junction 
interface having steep composition variations whose 
precision is accountable by the thickness of an atomic monolayer. 
The potential well structure and the grating structure  
 
having the above-mentioned hetero-junction have special 
optical and electrical characteristics
