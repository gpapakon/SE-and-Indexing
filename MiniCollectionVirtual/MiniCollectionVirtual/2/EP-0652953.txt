<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
morphogenic proteins and, more particularly, to
compositions having improved solubility in aqueous
solvents.Morphogenic proteins ("morphogens") are well known
and described in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4, 968,590; 5,011,691; 5,018,753; PCT US92/01968 and
PCT US92/07432; as well as various articles published in
the scientific literature, including Ozkaynak et al.
(1992) J.Biol. Chem.267:25220-25227 and Ozkaynak et al.
(1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.179:116-123. The
art has described how to isolate morphogenic proteins
from bone, how to identify genes encoding these proteins
and how to express them using recombinant DNA technology.
The morphogenic proteins are capable of inducing
endochondral bone formation and other tissue formation in
a mammal when they are properly folded, dimerized and
disulfide bonded to produce a dimeric species having the
appropriate three dimensional conformation. The proteins
have utility in therapeutic applications, either by
direct or systemic administration. Where bone induction
is desired, for example, the morphogen typically is
provided to the desired site for bone formation in a
mammal in association with a suitable matrix having the
appropriate conformation to allow the infiltration,
proliferation and differentiation of migrating progenitor
cells. The morphogenic protein adsorbed to the surfaces 
of a suitable matrix is generally referred to in the art
as an osteogenic device. The proteins can be isolated
from bone or, preferably, the gene encoding the protein
is produced recombinantly in a suitable host cell.The morphogen precursor polypeptide chains share a
common structural motif, including a N-terminal signal
sequence and pro region, both of which are cleaved to
produce a mature sequence, capable of disulfide bonding
and comprising an N-terminal extension and a C-terminal
domain whose amino acid sequence is highly conserved
among members of the family. In their mature dimeric
forms, the morphogens typically are fairly insoluble
under physiological conditions. Increasing the solubility
of these proteins has significant medical utility as it
would enhance systemic administration of morphogens as
therapeutics. Various carrier proteins, including serum
albumin and casein are known to increase the solubility
of morphogens (see, for example, PCT US92/07432). PCT
US92/05309 (WO 93/00050) discusses the use of various
solubilizing agents, including various amino acids and
methyl esters thereof, as well as guanidine,

a pair of protein subunits associated to form a protein dimer having
morphogenic activity.

seven cysteine domain of human OP-1, residues 330-431 of SEQ.ID No.
1,

   at least one of said subunits comprising a mature form of a subunit of a
member of the morphogen family, or an amino acid variant thereof,

noncovalently complexed with,
a peptide consisting of a pro region selected from sequence defined by
residues 30-48, 30-292 and 48-292 of sequence ID No.1

A complex as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein both said subunits
comprise a mature form of a subunit of a member of the morphogen family, or

an amino acid variant thereof, each said subunit being noncovalently
complexed with said peptide.

claimed in any one of claims 1-8 and optionally including a cofactor, such as a

symptom relieving cofactor.

tissue disorder, for example osteosarcoma, osteoporosis or Paget's disease.
A method of evaluating the status of a tissue, or of evaluating the efficacy of a
