<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a transport management 
apparatus for controlling the transport of a plurality of 

unmanned vehicles traveling over a travel grid formed from a 
plurality of node provided at stationary positions, and 

connection routes connecting the intervals between these 
nodes. The transport management apparatus according to the 

present invention comprises a first function for searching 
for a travel route for each unmanned vehicle in which an 

unmanned vehicle does not travel in the opposite direction 
over the same connection route as another unmanned vehicle 

and a second function for solving the progression 
impossibility of an unmanned vehicle using a node passing 

sequence change process, detour route search process or 
passing route search process, in the case when a progression 

impossibility of any unmanned vehicle is detected following 
simulation of the timed movements of each unmanned vehicle 

based on travel routes obtained by means of the 
aforementioned first function. As a result, the carrier 

efficiency therein can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transport management
control apparatus and method for the same which, in a unmanned
carrier system such as that found in factories and the like,
maintains the transport of unmanned carrier vehicles, and
also determines the carrier route.Fig. 1 shows a constructional outline of an automated
carrier system possessing a plurality of unmanned vehicles.
In this figure, a transport management control apparatus 100
for conducting management of an unmanned carrier system, a
passage type travel grid 101, and unmanned vehicles #1 to #5
are provided. In addition, on travel grid 101, a plurality
of nodes 1, 2, ..., 28 exist, at which unmanned vehicles #1
to #5 stop, change directions, and unload their contents. In
addition, each of unmanned vehicles #1 to #5 possesses a
function for determining its travel route up until its
individual target point (hereafter referred to as "target
node"); these unmanned vehicles move over their individually-determined
routes to their target nodes which are determined
by means of transport management control apparatus 100.
The detailed description with respect to a technique for
determining optimal route will be given later. In the following, an example of this unmanned carrier
system will be explained.Initially, move designations are sent from transport
management control apparatus 100 to unmanned vehicles #1 to
#5 as shown in Fig. 1. These unmanned vehicles #1 to #5 then
follow the optimal travel routes to respective target
destinations. In this determination of the optimal route,
the costs of each of the travel intervals (arcs) linking
neighboring nodes are used, and the route which provides the
minimum total cost value is selected. In the formation of
this travel route, the travel routes of other unmanned
vehicles are not taken into consideration; in other words,
the optimal travel route of one unmanned vehicle is
determined without considering the existence of other
unmanned vehicles. In addition, the aforementioned costs
represent characteristics such as the time required for
transit of each arc, and the like. Fig. 2 shows the cost
involved in travel grid 101; in this figure, the cost for
each arc is shown in ().Figs. 3 and 4 show the travel route of each unmanned
vehicle #1 to #5 formed at this time; Fig. 3 is a transport
diagram showing the travel routes of each of unmanned
vehicles #1 to #5 using a solid line, dotted line, short-dashed
line, single-dotted chain line, and double-dotted
chain line, respectively; Fig. 4 shows the
