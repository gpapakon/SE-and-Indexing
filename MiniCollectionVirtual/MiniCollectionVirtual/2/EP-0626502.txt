<ABSTRACT>
A casing assembly (13) for a ducted fan gas turbine 
engine (10) comprises a casing (17) around which extend 

two annular, axially spaced apart, frangible rails (26). 
Pieces of cloth (27) woven from an aromatic polyamide 

fibre are positioned on the casing (17) radially outer 
surface between the rails (26). Continuous layers 

(29,30) of the cloth are wound around the casing (17) 
radially outwardly of the rails (26) and cloth pieces 

(27). The arrangement provides enhanced containment of 
any fan blades (15) of the engine which may become 

detached from the gas turbine engine (10) which carries 
the casing assembly (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas turbine engine 
casing construction and is particularly concerned with 
the construction of the fan casing of a ducted fan gas 
turbine engine. Ducted fan gas turbine engines for powering aircraft 
conventionally comprise a core engine which drives a 
propulsive fan. The fan, in turn, comprises a number of 
radially extending aerofoil blades mounted on a common 
hub and enclosed within a generally cylindrical casing. There is a remote possibility with such engines that 
part or all of one or more of the fan blades could become 
detached from the remainder of the fan. This might be as 
the result of, for instance, the engine ingesting a large 
foreign body such as a bird. In the event of this 
happening, it is extremely important that the detached 
blade or blade portion is contained by the fan casing. 
Thus the fan casing must be sufficiently strong to ensure 
that the detached blade or blade portion does not pass 
through the casing and cause damage to the aircraft 
carrying the engine. There are various ways in which the problem of fan 
blade containment may be tackled. The most obvious way 
is to manufacture the fan casing from an alloy which is 
sufficiently strong and thick to provide the desired 
degree of containment. However this almost invariably 
results in a fan casing which is undesirably heavy. An 
alternative approach is to provide an alloy fan casing 
which is thin, and therefore light, and wind around it a 
strong fibrous material such as an aromatic polyamide. 
In the event of all or part of a fan blade becoming 
detached, it passes through the thin alloy casing but is 
contained by the fibrous material. There is a danger that the detached fan blade or 
blade part could cut through part of the fibre wrap, 
thereby reducing its ability to provide effective 
containment. This problem is addressed in GB2159886B by  
 
the provision of patches of the fibrous material 
interposed between the wound fibrous material and the 
casing. In the event that a fan blade or blade portion 
becomes detached, it pierces and passes through the 
casing to engage some of the patches. The patches wrap 
around the leading regions of the fan blade or blade 
portion to define a pad which in turn protects the wound 
fibrous material from being cut by those leading regions. It is important for the effective operation of fan 
blade containment systems of this kind that the patches 
of fibrous material are minimally constrained. However 
this can be difficult to achieve since they can
