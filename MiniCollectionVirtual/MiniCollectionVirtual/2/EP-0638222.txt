<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile radio system (1) with a central station (10) and several radio-telephones (11), the control data of the control procedures which run on a signalling and control channel of the mobile radio system (1) separated from a useful channel are stored centrally from the central station (10) in a data store (14) of the radio-telephones (11) with free storage space capacities (140). The extraction of the control data is protocolled by the central station (10) for access in the context of the control procedures taking place between the central station (10) and the radio-telephones (11). During these access procedures, the control data are interrogated according to a call protocol agreed between the central station (10) and the radio-telephones (11) and made available.

<CLAIMS>
Method for organizing control data for control 
procedures executed between at least one terminating unit 

and a common base unit in communication systems, in which 
the control data of the control procedures are stored and 

managed, characterized in that 

a) base-unit-specific control data of base-unit-specific 
control procedures are stored decentrally at free 

storage locations (140) in data stores (14) of the 
terminating units (11) depending on the storage 

capacity in the terminating units (11) and also on the 
type of base-unit-specific control procedures, 
b) the swapping out of the base-unit-specific control 
data is managed by the base unit (10) for accesses in 

the course of the control procedures being executed 
between the base unit (10) and the terminating units 

(11), 
c) during the accesses the base-unit-specific control 
data are interrogated and made available in accordance 

with a call protocol agreed between the base unit (10) 
and the terminating units (11). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the control procedures are executed on a signalling 

and control channel (19) of the communication system (1) 
separate from a user channel (18). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the terminating units (11) are designed as radio 

telephones and the base unit (10) is designed as a base 
station having a radio unit and integrated switching 

circuitry.  
 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the control data comprise abbreviated dialling 

numbers. 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the control data comprise data for ringing 

control. 
Arrangement for carrying out the method according 
to one of Claims 1 to 5 with means (12, 14, 16, 18, 19) 

for storing and managing control data for control procedures 
executed between at least one terminating unit 

(11) and a common base unit (10) in communication systems, 
which control procedures are arranged in the 

terminating unit (11) and base unit (10), characterized 
in that the means (12, 14, 16, 18, 19) are designed in 

such a way that 

a) base-unit-specific control data of base-unit-specific 
control procedures are stored decentrally at free 

storage locations (140) in data stores (14) of the 
terminating units (11) depending on the storage 

capacity in the terminating units (11) and also on the 
type of base-unit-specific control procedures, 
b) the swapping out of the base-unit-specific control 
data is managed by the base unit (10) for accesses in 

the course of the control procedures being executed 
between the base unit (10) and the terminating units 

(11), 
c) during the accesses the base-unit-specific control 
data are interrogated and made available in accordance 

with a call protocol agreed between the base unit (10) 
and the terminating units (11).
