<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fixed geometry gas 
turbine combustor which produces very low NOx, CO, and total 
hydrocarbon emissions in which the flow of combustion air 
and dilution air is redistributed over the entire range of 
operation of the gas turbine using a pneumatic valve in the 
form of an inspirator. Increasing concern about acid rain and ambient air 
quality has accelerated the development of ultra-low 
emission, natural gas combustion technologies for use in 
boilers, furnaces, incinerators, and more recently, gas 
turbines. This concern is focused not only on the oxides of 
sulfur and nitrogen, but also on carbon monoxide and total 
reactive hydrocarbons. Of all the pollutants resulting from natural gas 
combustion, experience has shown that NOx has been the most 
difficult to minimize from a practical standpoint. Various 
approaches have been developed for reducing NOx emissions. 
However, the resulting reduction is insufficient in many 
cases to satisfy stringent air quality standards. Common 
modifications to natural gas combustion processes reduce NOx 
emissions at the expense of reduced equipment efficiency and 
very often at the expense of increased carbon monoxide (CO) 
and total reactive hydrocarbon emissions. The basic approaches for lowering NOx emissions 
focus on reducing the concentration of free oxygen, 
residence time, and combustion temperature in the combustion 
zone. Various proven practical combustion technologies for 
reducing NOx formation include injection of diluents into 
the combustion zone, such as excess air, steam and water,  
 
homogeneous combustion, staged firing, recirculation of 
combustion products and flue gases, and heat removal from 
the flame. However, the only practical approach that has 
reduced NOx emissions to single digit levels is premixed 
combustion. Accordingly, an advanced dry combustor to 
achieve ultra-low emissions for all combustion pollutants, 
that is, NOx, carbon monoxide, and total reactive 
hydrocarbons, would apply the following techniques: 
Fuel/air premixing; high excess air combustion; and 
intensive turbulence, mixing and combustion products 
recirculation. When such a combustor is applied to a gas turbine, 
several problems arise due to the specific environment 
required by a gas turbine combustor. Among the problem 
areas are: performance of the combustor when operating at 
high turndown over the entire range when the gas turbine 
operation changes from full load to idle; capability of the 
combustor to meet the requirements
