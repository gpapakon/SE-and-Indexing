<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski equipped with a running sole which has discontinuous striations (50, 70) and which comprises a central zone (5) for flat gliding and, on at least one side, a lateral zone (6, 7) for curved gliding, the latter bordering the central zone (5). The surface of the rear part at least of the central zone (5) included between the rear contact line (11) and the median boot line of the ski is equipped with a marked profile such that the measured values of the significant parameters of roughness Rtm and Rku are greater than the values measured on the surface of the said lateral zone (6, 7) for curved gliding. The invention relates more particularly to a downhill (alpine) ski whose turning and gliding capabilities are improved.

Snow ski comprising a lower surface (1) having a variable width (L) made of
a plastic material, equipped with a plurality of discontinuous serrations (50, 70) and two side

running edges (2) that laterally border said surface (1), said surface resting on a forward
contact line (10) and a rear contact line (11) when the ski does not carry a load, the lower

surface (1) comprising a central flat gliding zone (5) extending between both contact lines
(10, 11) and, at least on one side, a lateral curved gliding zone (6, 7) bordering said central

zone (5) between both contact lines whose width (l1) is greater than 0.03 L, the surface of
the rear portion at least, of said central zone (5), comprised between the rear contact line (11)

and the boot center line (12) of the ski, being provided with a pronounced structuring such
that the measured values of the significant roughness parameters Rtm and Rku are greater

than the values measured on the surface of said lateral curved gliding zone (6, 7).
Ski according to claim 1, characterized in that the lower surface comprises two
lateral zones (6, 7) that are symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal axis of the ski,

bordering said central zone (5) on both sides.
Ski according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the Rtm value is less than
or equal to 15 µm and the Rku value is less than or equal to 3 in the surface of said lateral

zone(s) (6, 7), whereas Rtm 
>
 15 µm and Rku 
>
 3 in the rear portion, at least, of said central
zone (5).
Ski according to any of claims 1, 2, or 3, characterized in that the width (l1)
of the lateral zone(s) (6, 7) is comprised between 0.03 L and 0.3 L, considering that the width

(l2) of the central flat gliding zone is greater than or equal to 0.45 L. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the width
(l1) of the lateral zone(s) (6, 7) increases from the vicinity of the minimum lower surface

width line (L min), in the direction of the contact lines (10, 11).
Ski according to claim 5, characterized in that the width (l2) of the strongly
serrated central zone (5) is constant.
Ski according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the width (l1) of the lateral
zone(s) (6, 7) is greater than or equal to 2 mm in the vicinity of the minimum width line (L

min) and (l1) is greater than or equal to 10 mm in the victory of said contact lines (10, 11),
Ski according to any of claims 1-4, characterized in that the width (l1) of the
lateral zone(s) (6, 7) is constant and the width (l2) of the central flat gliding zone (5) increases

progressively from the vicinity of minimum width (L) in the direction of contact lines (10, 11).
Ski according to claim 8, characterized in that the width (l1) of the lateral
zone(s) (6, 7) is greater than or equal to 6 mm.
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the strongly
structured central zone (5) comprises a plurality of short, rectilinear and discontinuous

serrations (50), arranged in separate or meshed rows.
Ski according to claim 10, characterized in that a majority, at least, of the
serrations (50) are oriented along the longitudinal axis of the ski.
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
structuring has such a roughness gradient that the measured Rtm and Rku parameters increase

progressively from the running edge (2) towards the longitudinal axis, at least over a 
significant portion of the width (L) of the lower surface, considering that the roughness (Rtm,

Rku) can be substantially constant over small width portions.
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
structuring along the longitudinal axis has such a roughness gradient that the measured

parameters Rtm and Rku vary progressively, from the rear contact line (11) towards the
forward contact line (10), over a substantial portion, at least, of the length of the ski,

considering that the roughness can be substantially constant over certain length portions (ΔL).
Method for making a ski according to claim 1, characterized in that the
structuring of the central zone (5) is obtained by passing a heated and pressurized tool (8)

over the sole (1), said tool having the shape of a roller comprising a raised design of a
constant edge width (l) on the surface from which a plurality of discontinuous ribs (80) are

formed.
