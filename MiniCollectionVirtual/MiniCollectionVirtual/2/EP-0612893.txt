<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an elevating device (6) 
at floor drains (1), which elevating device (6) comprises 

an elevating member (7) directed upwards from the floor 
drain (1) and a flange member (8) provided on top of 

said elevating member (7). For being able to adapt one 
and the same elevating member (7) to substantially different 

floor levels relative to the floor drain (1), the 
elevating member (7) and flange member (8) are two separate 

members which can be separated from each other for 
exposure of upper portions of the elevating member (7), 

said upper portions of the elevating member (7) can 
after the exposure be cut for reducing the original 

height (UH) of said elevating member (7) to the desired 
height (H), the flange member (8) can once again be 

located on the elevating member (7) after said elevating 
member (7) has been cut to the desired height (H), 

and the elevating member (7) has threads (10) provided 
thereon for screwing the flange member (8) onto the 

elevating member (7) such that said flange member (8) 
can be screwed onto the threads (10) left on the remaining 

part of the elevating member (7) after cutting 
thereof to the desired height (H).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elevation device
for floor drains, which device comprises an elevation
member directed upwards from the floor drain and a
flange member provided on top of said elevating member.When a floor is cast, the floor drain is usually located
somewhat too low for not risking that it protrudes
above the floor and thereby obstructs the flow of
water down into the floor drain. The floor drain must
thereafter often be provided with an elevating device,
the flange of which is located flush with the floor
level such that a floor mat via the elevation device
can be connected to the floor drain with the required
sealing. Elevation devices are also used when a new floor is
cast on top of an existing floor. Hereby, the elevation
device is placed close to the floor drain provided
in the existing floor, whereby a flange member of
the elevation device is brought flush with the new
floor level. Hereby, the floor mat on the new floor
level can be brought down into the flange member and
secured close thereto by means of a clamping ring. In
this way, water can flow down into the floor drain,
although the floor level is raised above the drain.
Elevation devices with this function are already known
from e.g. applicant's own SE 343 358 and US-A-4,694,513.However, it has been noticed that one must manufacture
and store several different types of elevation devices
in order to cover the present need, since elevation
devices with a certain height fit into floor layers
with a certain thickness, but not into floor layers
with another thickness.The object of the present invention is to eliminate
this problem and provide an elevation device which is
easily adaptable to the floor level in question and
to all existing thicknesses of new floor layers. This
is arrived at according to the invention substantially
while the elevation device defined above has the characterizing
features of subsequent claim 1.Since according to the invention the elevation member
can be cut at the top and the flange member thereafter
mounted on the cut elevation member, one and the same
elevation device can be adapted to the floor level
in question and to the thickness of new floor layers
irrespective of said layers being thick or thin. The
threads provided on the elevation member prevent the
flange member from being pulled off the elevation member. 
It is also possible to compensate the total height
of the elevation device if too large a portion of the
elevation member is cut off.The invention will be further described below
