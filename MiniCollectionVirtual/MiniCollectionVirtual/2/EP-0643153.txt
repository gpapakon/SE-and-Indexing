<ABSTRACT>
A structured metallised coating is produced on a substrate by providing a transparent support (2) with thin homogenous coating of metal. The coated support is brought into close contact with the substrate (3) and the support pulsed with a laser beam (5). This causes the metal in a certain area of the support to be evaporated and condensed onto the substrate. The selectively coated area of the substrate then acts as a nucleation site for a chemically reducing coating bath. The substrate may be a ceramic or a polymer and the homogeneous metal coating is made of an adhesive agent and/or catalytically effective substances. The substrate when selectively coated with nucleation site is sprayed with deionised water prior to metal coating in a solution.

A process for the fabrication of structured 
metallizations on surfaces by means of a laser beam 

and a transparent carrier provided with coatings and 
by a chemical-reductive bath, characterized by that 

the transparent carrier (2) is provided with a thin 
homogeneous metal coating (1) and brought with the 

metal coating (1) into a close contact with the surface 
(3) to be metallized and is then irradiated by 

the pulsed laser beam (5), transfer of the metal from 
the transparent carrier (2) being achieved by laser 

evaporation and subsequent condensation on the substrate 
surface (3), and that after the selective seeding 

of substrate surface (3), metallization of the 
seeded zones (6) is performed in a chemical-reductive 

bath. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized 
by that for the substrate are chosen ceramic or a 

polymer. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized 
by that the substrate surface (3) to be metallized 

is formed by a front-edge surface (11) with an 
electrically conductive layer (9) of a liquid crystal 

cell (8), said layer (9) extending up to the front-edge 
surface (11). 
A process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized 
by that the selective seeding is programmed.  

 
A process according to claims 1 to 4, characterized 
by that the thin homogeneous metal coating 

is formed of a substance improving adhesion and/or a 
catalytically acting substance. 
A process according to claims 1 to 5, characterized 
by that the seeded substrate surface (3, 11) 

is rinsed with deionized water.
