<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a negative electrode
for use in a secondary battery. More particularly, the
present invention is concerned with a negative electrode
for use in a secondary battery, comprising specific milled
carbon fibers, which can provide a lithium secondary
battery with nonaqueous electrolytes having large charge
and discharge capacities per weight and exhibiting
excellent charge and discharge cycle characteristics.The secondary battery in which an alkali metal such as
lithium is used as an active material of the negative
electrode has generally various advantages. For example,
it not only ensures high energy and high electromotive force,
but also has a wide operating temperature range due to
the use of a nonaqueous electrolyte and is excellent in
shelf life, miniaturization and lightweight.Therefore, the practical use of the above lithium
secondary battery with nonaqueous electrolytes is
anticipated as a power source for use in a portable
electronic appliance and also as a high-performance battery
for use in an electric vehicle and electricity storage. However, all the developed prototype batteries have
not fully realized the above properties anticipated from
the lithium secondary battery, and thus have been
incomplete from the viewpoint of cycle life, charge and
discharge capacities and energy density.A major cause thereof resided in the negative electrode
used in the secondary battery.For example, a lithium secondary battery having a
negative electrode composed of lithium metal incorporated
therein has disadvantageously short life cycle and poor
safety because lithium precipitated on the surface of the
negative electrode during charging tends to form acicular dendrites
which are apt to cause a short-circuit between the negative and
positive electrodes.Lithium has extremely high reactivity, thereby causing
the electrolyte to suffer from decomposition reaction in
the vicinity of the surface of the negative electrode.
Thus, there was the danger that the above decomposition
reaction would modify the surface of the negative electrode
to thereby lower the cell capacity during repeated uses of
the secondary battery.Various studies have been made on the material of the
negative electrode with a view toward obviating the above
problems of the lithium secondary battery.For example, the use of alloys containing lithium,
such as lithium/aluminum and Wood's alloy, as the material
of the negative electrode of the lithium secondary battery, 
has been studied. However, this negative electrode
