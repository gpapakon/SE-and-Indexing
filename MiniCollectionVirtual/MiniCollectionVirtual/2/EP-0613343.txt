<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for rolling wrappers onto cigar bodies, comprising a lower roll unit (10) and an upper roll unit with two parallel rolls (46, 48) rotatable about their own axes. According to the invention, the lower roll unit (10) comprises four rolls (14, 16, 18, 20) which are mounted in a common holder (22) at each end. The holders (22) can be rotated about their centre axis in 90 DEG steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for rolling 
wrappers onto cigar bodies, comprising, on one hand, a 
lower roll unit with a pair of rolls with parallel rolls 
lying in a horizontal plane and rotatable in the same 
direction for supporting contact with the lower half of a 
cigar body when a wrapper is rolled thereon, said rolls 
being mounted in a holder at either end of the rolls and, 
on the other hand, an upper roll unit with two parallel 
rolls rotatable in the same direction about their own 
axes, and which, when rolling on the wrapper, are disposed 
in a horizontal plane above and parallel to the 
rolls in the lower roll unit for counteracting contact 
against the upper half of the cigar body. A device of this type is previously known 
for instance from EP-A-0 194 670 and has been 
used for decades with high reliability for wrapping cigar 
bodies with wrappers producing cigars of high quality. In 
such a device, a cigar body is picked up from a feeding 
conveyor by means of a gripper which moves back and forth 
transporting the body and depositing it between the lower 
pair of rolls and thereafter returning to its pick-up 
station. The upper pair of rolls is thereafter moved from 
a retracted position to rolling contact with the top of 
the cigar body, whereafter a vacuum conveyor delivers a 
wrapper above the roll apparatus by a so-called wrapper-needle 
pressing one end of the wrapper against one end of 
the cigar body. After completed rolling of the wrapper 
above the cigar body, another conveyor picks up the 
finished wrapped cigar and places it on an exit conveyor. One disadvantage of this device is that the productivity 
is relatively limited, since only about 30 bodies can be 
wrapped per minute. One purpose of the present invention is to improve the 
productivity of a rolling apparatus of the type in  
 
question while retaining the otherwise good rolling 
properties of the previously known device. In order to 
solve this problem, it is suggested in accordance with 
the present invention that the lower roll unit comprises 
at least two additional rolls which are mounted in the 
same holder as the two other rolls in the lower roll unit 
and rotatable about their own axes in the same direction 
as these, that the holders be rotatable about their 
centre axis in 90째 steps to always present two of its 
rolls in an upper position beside each other, and that 
the upper and lower roll units be moveable towards and 
away from each other. By disposing the four rolls in this 
manner in the

Device for rolling wrappers onto cigar bodies, comprising, 
on one hand, a lower roll unit (10) with a pair 

of rolls with parallel rolls (14, 16) lying in a horizontal 
plane and rotatable in the same direction for 

supporting contact with the lower half of the cigar body 
when a wrapper is rolled thereon, said rolls being 

mounted in a holder (22) at either end of the rolls, and, 
on the other hand, an upper roll unit (12) with two 

parallel rolls (46, 48) rotatable in the same direction 
about their own axes, and which, when the wrapper is 

rolled on, are disposed in a horizontal plane above and 
parallel to the rolls in the lower roll unit (10) for 

counteracting contact against the upper half of the cigar 
body, 
characterized
 in that the lower roll 
unit (10) comprises at least two additional rolls (18, 

20), which are mounted in the same holder (22) as the two 
other rolls (14, 16) in the lower roll unit, and 

rotatable about their own axes in the same direction as 
these, that the holders (22) are rotatable about their 

central axis in 90째 steps to always present two of its 
rollers in an upper position beside each other, and that 

the upper and lower roll units (10, 12) are moveable 
towards and away from each other. 
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the rolls (14, 16, 18, 20) in the lower 

roll unit (10) are identical and are mounted equiangularly 
spaced about a common circle, the centre of which 

coincides with the rotational axis of the holders (22). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that a swingable dock (54) is coupled to to 

the lower roll unit (10) and is disposed to receive and 
carry a deposited cigar body (
a
, 
b
, 
c
) which is to be 
wrapped with a wrapper, in an area in front of the gap  

 
between two rolls (16, 18; 18, 20) lying vertically one 

on top of the other in the lower roll unit (10). 
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the dock (54) is swung in the same 

direction as the rotation of the lower roll unit (10) and 
tips at the same time the carried cigar body (
b
, 
c
) to be 
wrapped into the gap between the adjacent roll (16, 18; 

18, 20) which, after 90째 rotation of the holders (22) 
will form the upper pair of rolls in the lower roll unit 

in order to carry the cigar body and together with the 
rolls in the upper roll unit (12) to rotate said cigar 

body during the rolling-on of the wrapper. 
Device according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized
 
in that the lower roll unit (10) is 

vertically moveable relative to the upper roll unit (12). 
Device according to one of Claims 1-5, 
characterized
 
in that the upper roll unit (12) is 

fixed. 
Device according to one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized
 
in that the holder (22) at one end of

(40, 42, 44) for uniform rotation in unison of 

the four rolls (14, 16, 18, 20) of the unit. 
Device according to one of Claims 1-7, 
characterized
 
in that the lower roll unit (10) is
