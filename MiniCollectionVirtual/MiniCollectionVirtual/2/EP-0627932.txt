<ABSTRACT>
An antigen binding protein construct or "minibody" which includes the VL and VH domains of a native antibody fused to the hinge region and CH3 domain of the immunoglobulin molecule is described. Minibodies are small versions of whole antibodies which encode in a single chain the essential elements of a whole antibody. Minibodies are expressed by host cells transformed with minibody genes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel antigen binding
protein construct or "minibody" which includes the
essential elements of an antibody.Previous workers (1)1/ have demonstrated that
single chain antigen-binding proteins can be
generated by linking the heavy chain variable domain
and light chain variable domain of an antibody into a
single protein, using a short linker peptide. The
length and composition of the linker can vary (2).
Single chain antibodies can be produced in E. coli
which retain antigen-binding activity. Milenic (3)
provides one recent example of a single chain
antibody that binds a tumor antigen. Several other
single chain antibodies generated that bind to
various haptens and antigens have been reported.Gillies and Wesolowski (4) demonstrated that the
CH2 domain of antibodies can be deleted with
retention of the antigen binding function. The CH3
domains of such ΔCH2 antibodies permit dimerization.
ΔCH2 antibodies are useful for invivo diagnostics
and potentially therapy (5).To produce bispecific antibodies, Kostelny et al
(6) fused Fab fragments of antibodies to the leucine
zipper portions of fos and jun proteins in the 
absence of a single chain construct for the antigen
combining region. Pack and Pluckthun (7), fused a
single chain antibody to amphipathic helices from a
four helix bundle or from leucine zipper proteins.Minibodies are engineered antibody constructs
comprised of the variable heavy (VH) and variable
light (VL) chain domains of a native antibody fused
to the hinge region and to the CH3 domain of the
immunoglobulin molecule. Minibodies are thus small
versions of whole antibodies encoded in a single
protein chain which retain the antigen binding
region, the CH3 domain to permit assembly into a
bivalent molecule and the antibody hinge to
accommodate dimerization by disulfide linkages. In
contrast, native antibodies are comprised of four
chains, two heavy and two light.The size, valency and affinity of the minibody is
particularly suited for invivo targeting.
Expression in bacterial or mammalian cells is
simplified because minibodies are in single chains.Figure 1 depicts one form of a minibody in which
VL indicates the variable light chain domain and VH
indicates the variable heavy chain domain of a native
T84.66 antibody. The hinge and CH3 domain are from
human IgG.Figure 2 depicts a dimerized minibody.Figure 3 depicts the construction of a minibody
gene.Figure 4 depicts CEA binding ability of the
expression of the product of a T84.66 minibody.A minibody is a chimeric
