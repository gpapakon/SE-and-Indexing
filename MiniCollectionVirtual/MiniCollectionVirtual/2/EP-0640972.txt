<ABSTRACT>
Video information can be recorded in a memory (16) of small capacity 
for a long period of time. The memory (16) is mounted on a tape cassette 

(4) and video information is recorded in the memory (16). Video 
information is recorded in the memory (16) under the control of a system 

controller (11) formed by a microcomputer. The system controller (11) is 
supplied with information from a calendar circuit (17) which generates date 

information, information from a clock circuit (18) which generates clock 
information, information from a global positioning system (GPS) circuit 

(19) which generates place information, and information from a scene 
setting switch (20) of an operation unit (12). When video information is 

recorded by using date information, for example, video information is 
processed by the system controller (11) in a predetermined manner by using 

the date information, and recorded in the memory (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the recording of video information, for
example in a memory mounted on a tape cassette of a video cassette recorder
(VCR).US Patents Nos US-A-4 338 644 and US-A-4 383 285 describe
arrangements in which a memory is mounted on a tape cassette of a VCR and
video information is recorded in this memory.Japanese Patent Application No. H04-217503 and corresponding European
Patent Application Publication No. EP-A-0 580 434 (published on 26 January
1994) disclose such recording medium cassettes. Each of the above
applications is owned by the present applicants.When video information is recorded in a memory mounted on a tape
cassette of VCR, or when video information is recorded by a VCR of a
single-unit video camera-recorder type, for example, a starting track No.
(number) and an ending track No. can be recorded in a ganged relation to
operation of a recording operation switch each time recording of video
information is implemented.However, when the video information is recorded in the memory mounted
on the tape cassette of the VCR, if the memory capacity is 4Kbits, then
about 30 data can be recorded on the memory together with only the starting
track No. and the ending track No. In this case, if character information
or the like is recorded in the memory together with video information, then
about 10 data can be recorded in the memory.In that case, if the starting track No. and the ending track No. are
recorded in the memory by the VCR of the single-unit video camera-recorder
type each time a recording of video information is implemented, there is 
then the risk that the number of recorded video data will exceed 30.
Although the number of video data to be recorded can be increased if the
capacity of the memory is increased, the capacity of the memory cannot be
increased too much because such memory should be capable of being mounted
on mass-produced tape cassettes.International Published Patent Application W0-A-93/04473 discloses a
system in which directory information regarding recorded video signals on a
video tape is recorded on an external memory. The directory information
includes title, location on the tape and program length.According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
video information recording method for recording video information
describing a recorded video signal to form a video information packet, said
video information comprising at least a recording starting track number, a
recording ending track number and further information describing said
reco

<CLAIMS>
A video information recording method for recording video information
describing a recorded video signal to form a video information packet, said

video information comprising at least a recording starting track number
(BTNn), a recording ending track number (ETNn) and further information

(DATAn) describing said recorded video signal, said method comprising the
steps of:


comparing (S7) further information in two immediately preceding
previously recorded video information packets; and
if said comparison indicates matching further information, then
concatenating said two immediately preceding recorded video information

packets to form a single concatenated video information packet.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said further information is
date information and said comparison indicates a match when said date

information are equal.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said further
information is clock information and said comparison indicates a match when

said clock information falls within a predetermined time period of one
another.
A method according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3, wherein said
further information is place information and said comparison indicates a

match recorded when said place information falls within a predetermined
range of one another. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
further information is information supplied from an operation unit and said

comparison indicates a match when said information representative of
operation contents are equal.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein a
latest video information packet is recorded separately and said latest

separately recorded video information packet is compared when the next
recording is started.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein
further information of a previously recorded video information packet is

amended after an alarm is generated when the capacity of a recording medium
in which said video information is memorized is filled.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
single concatenated video information packet comprises a recording starting

track number of the earlier recorded of said two immediately preceding
previously recorded video information packets and a recording ending track

number of the later recorded of said two immediately preceding previously
recorded video information packets
A tape cassette having a sub recording medium (16) storing video
information packets recorded in accordance with the method of claim 1 and a

main recording medium (5) storing a recorded video signal, the tape
cassette (4) comprising:


a cassette housing for housing said main and sub recording media (5,
16); and 
an interface for receiving video information packets from a recording
or reproducing apparatus.
A tape cassette according to claim 9, wherein said further
information is date information and said comparison indicates a match when

said date information are equal.
A tape cassette according to claim 9 or claim 10, wherein said
further information is clock information and said comparison indicates a

match when said clock information falls within a predetermined time period
of one another.
A tape cassette according to claim 9, claim 10 or claim 11, wherein
said further information is place information and said comparison indicates

a match when said place information falls within a predetermined range of
one another.
A tape cassette according to any one of claims 9 to 12, wherein said
further information is information supplied from an operation unit and said

comparison indicates a match when said information representative of
operation contents are equal.
A tape cassette according to any one of claims 9 to 13, wherein a
latest video information packet is recorded separately and said latest

separately recorded video information packet is compared when the next
recording is started.
A tape cassette according to any one of claims 9 to 14, wherein said 
further information of a previously recorded video information packet is

amended after an alarm is generated when the capacity of a recording medium
