<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for mounting a first element (4) on a tube (3) provided with a fluid channel. The device comprises a second element (9) slidably mounted relative to said first element (4). A first axial through-passage (35) is arranged in the second element (9), and coupling arms (26) rigidly interconnect the first element (4, 37) and the tube (3) in a predetermined axial position, wherein the second element (9) is in axial engagement with said tube (3) around an opening of the fluid channel therein, so that the channel is in communication with said first axial through-passage (35). A first seal (16) is located between the second element (9) and the tube (3), and an inner space (19) extends axially between the opposed surfaces (6, 18) of the first and second elements (4, 9) respectively, said space communicating with the first axial passage (35) in the second element (9) so that the fluid pressure in the space (19) urges the second element (9) against the tube (3). The compression force on the first seal (16) is dependent on the fluid pressure.

A device (1) for mounting a first element (4, 
37 ; 41, 42) on a tubular part (3) provided with a fluid 

runner and comprising a second element (9 ; 11) slideably 
and sealingly mounted with respect to the first element 

(4, 37 ; 41, 42), characterised in that : 

a first axial through hole (35) is arranged in the 
second element (9), 
coupling means (26) make the first element (4, 37) 
integral with the part (3) in a predetermined axial 

position, wherein the second element (9, 11) axially 
rests around an opening of the fluid runner of said part 

(3), and allows for the communication between the runner 
and said first axial through hole (35), 
a first seal (16) is inserted and axially abutting 
between the second element (9) and the part (3), 
and an internal space (19) extends, in the axial 

direction, between opposed faces (6, 18) of the first and 
second elements, respectively (4, 9), the fluid running 

in said space which is in fluid communication with the 
first axial through hole (35) of the second element (9, 

11). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the second element (9) comprises a dismountable 

head (11) provided with a supporting face the first seal 
(16). 
A device as claimed in claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a spring (20) is inserted between 

said first and second elements (4, 9) for enhancing the 
crushing of the first seal (16) abutting against the part 

(3), said spring (20) extending in the space (19) between 
the opposed faces (6, 18) of the first and second 

elements (4, 9).  
 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that one of the elements (4, 9) is provided with 

abutting means (21) for limiting the axially sliding 
motion of the second element (9) with respect to the 

first element (4). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that at least a second seal (23, 24) is inserted 

between the first element (4) and the second element (9). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that said coupling means (26) includes a holding 

mechanism to be engaged with the part (3) in a region 
opposite the first seal (16). 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised 
in that said coupling means (26) comprises at least one 

arm (27) rotatably mounted on said first element (4) at 
the opposite of the holding means. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that said first and second elements (4, 9) each have a 

circular section, said second element (9) including a 
portion (17) to be centered with respect to the part (3). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the part (3) is formed by a pipe axially abutting 

against the second element (9), said first element (4) 
comprising a second axial through hole (8) in 

communication with another pipe (2) which can be 
connected to a pressurised fluid source. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that said first element constitutes a sealing plug 

(37). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised 
in that the diameter of the first seal (16) supporting 

face is smaller than the diameter of the internal space 
(19) filled with pressurised fluid, so that the abutting  

 
force of the first seal (16) against the part (3) is 

multiplied. 
A device as claimed in claim 9, characterised 
in that an axial expansion bellows (40) is sealed in the 

internal space (19) between a head (11) composing said 
second element (9) and a socket (41) integrally mounted 

on the pipe (2). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 11, 
characterised in that the second element (9) is pushed 

against the part (3) by the pressure of the fluid in the 
space (19), with the crushing stress of the first seal 

(16) depending on said pressure.
