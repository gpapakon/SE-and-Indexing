<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns Agrobacterium strains which harbour
recombinant DNA and which are capable of site-specific
recombination, a method for obtaining said Agrobacterium
strains, and methods of use of said Agrobacterium strains.Agrobacterium is a genus of gram-negative soil bacteria
which cause neoplastic cell growth in dicotyledonous plants
by means of the natural system they possess for transferring
phytohormone-producing DNA to plant cells. The T-(transferred)region
is a segment of the large so-called Ti-(tumour
inducing)plasmid (200 kb) harboured by all virulent
Agrobacterium strains. (Occasionally, the T-region is also
referred to as T-DNA). Mobilization of the T-region to the
plant cells is mediated by another region of the Ti-plasmid,
which is called the vir-(virulence)region, in a process that
resembles bacterial conjugation (see for reviews: Melchers LS
and Hooykaas PJJ (1987) In: Miflin BJ (ed) Oxford surveys of
plant and cell biology, vol 4. Oxford Univ Press, London/New
York, pp 167-220; Zambryski P (1988) Annu. Rev. Genet. 22:1-30;
Zambryski P, Temp√© J, Schell J (1989) Cell 56:193-201).This natural gene transfer system can be used to co-transfer
DNA not naturally present in the T-region. The T-region
is flanked by two 24 bp imperfect direct repeats (T-DNA
borders) which are the only cis-essential elements for
the transfer process; i.e. the borders must be linked to the
DNA to be transferred to the plant cell. An ideal vector
system for transferring DNA to plant cells should comprise
the DNA to be transferred into the plant cell flanked on both
sides by T-DNA borders, although it has been established that
the right T-DNA border, preferably in conjunction with a
region just outside the T-region and referred to as
"overdrive", suffices for the transfer of DNA. Although not
essential, the presence of this overdrive increases the
efficiency of transfer of the DNA flanking the right border.The second essential element, the vir region, can be 
provided in trans, i.e. not physically linked to the T-region.
This finding has originated in the development of a
binary vector system, in which the T-region, comprising DNA
to be co-transferred to the plant cell, is cloned into a
broad-host-range plasmid which is capable of replication in
Agrobacterium and E. coli, while the vir functions are
supplied by a disarmed helper plasmid which does not contain
a T-region (Hoekema A, Hirsch PR, Hooykaas PJJ, Schilperoort
RA (1983) Nature 310:115-120; European Patent EP-B 120 516);
