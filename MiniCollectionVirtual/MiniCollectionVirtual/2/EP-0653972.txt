<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automatic operations 
on materials and inter alia to carrying out high speed 
operations particularly but by no means exclusively 
cutting operations on materials especially lace. Lace is made in wide e.g. 5 m widths from which 
narrower widths are cut usually along more or less 
deeply scalloped figuring. Mechanical arrangements 
exist capable of cutting relatively shallowly scalloped 
edges at reasonable speeds but require time-consuming 
setting up and constant operator attention. For the 
more intricate designs and deeper scalloping, it is 
possible to cut only by hand, which adds very 
considerably to the cost of the finished product. It is, of course, known that lasers will cut 
materials and it is natural to contemplate the use of 
lasers for cutting lace. There are, however, some 
considerable problems involved in tracking a laser spot 
along the precisely required line of cut, not least 
because of the fact that lace is a flexible and easily 
distortable fabric which may well have faults which add 
to the problem of knowing where to cut. Moreover, the 
act of cutting - because the cut threads are under 
tension - necessarily brings about its own distortions.  
 Various proposals have been made for using 
machine vision to guide an operation effector such as a 
laser spot or a hot wire along a path such as a lace 
cutting path. I. Kimoto et al, "Automation of Sealant 
Painting and Lace Cutting Using Pattern Tracking 
Techniques", The International Journal of Advanced 
Manufacturing Technology, 1 (4) 101-107, 1986 discloses 
the use of a photo-sensor array to detect the flange 
pattern of a crankcase while it is on a moving conveyor 
and a micro-computer to deliver appropriate pre-recorded 
commands after processing input signals from the array 
and conveyor speed sensors to deposit liquid sealant on 
the flange with nozzles installed behind the sensing 
devices. For lace cutting, a CCD camera is mounted with 
a laser cutter on an X-Y traversing mechanism above the 
travelling lace, which is enhanced to eliminate dot 
ambiguities and generate a clear pattern. The curved 
contours of figuring on the lace can thus be clearly 
discriminated, and "followed" by the traversing 
mechanism. Pattern recognition speed for lace cutting 
depends on the lace pattern, but for simple patterns, 
cutting speeds as high as 100 mm/s are promised.  
 US-A-4 907 169 also discloses an adaptive 
tracking vision and guidance system with a vision system 
and a robot end effector mounted on a
