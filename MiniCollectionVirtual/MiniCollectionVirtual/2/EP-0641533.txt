<CLAIMS>
Seat of an operator's chair, the seat surface of which is formed from a plurality of
resilient or partially resilient supporting elements (1 to 8) arranged close to one

another and which sit in perforations (9) supported in a support part (10), have
different heights and are arranged to be distributed on the seat surface (11) such

that the latter essentially follows the contours of the body part to be supported,
wherein the support part (10) has a edge (12) at least partially enclosing the seat

surface (11), characterised in that the edge (12) partially encloses the particular
directly abutting supporting elements (1 to 8) for the purpose of stabilisation.
Seat according to claim 1, in which the supporting elements (1 to 8) have a
cylindrical shape, sit with an approximately cylindrical necked-down portion (19)

for support in the perforations (9) and are placed against the lower side of the
support part (10) with an essentially disc-like part (15) of greater diameter.
Seat according to claim 1 or 2, in which the supporting elements (1 to 8) are
rounded on their seat surface side.
Seat according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the support part (10) is closed
from below by means of a releasable base plate (13).
