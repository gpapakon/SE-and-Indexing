<ABSTRACT>
Method of undersea acoustic transmission, characterised in that, on transmission, the signal to be transmitted is first of all sampled, digitised and stored in memory, then de-sampled and de-digitised at a frequency lower than the sampling frequency and then transmitted in analog form, and that, on reception, the signal is correspondingly sampled, digitised and stored in memory at the abovementioned de-sampling and de-digitising frequency, then replayed at the abovementioned sampling frequency.

Method of acoustic undersea transmission, characterised
by the fact that at the time of emission, the signal to be

emitted is previously sampled, digitized and memorised, then
desampled and de-digitized at a frequency lower than the sampling

frequency and thus emitted in analog form and that at the time
of reception, the signal is, in a corresponding manner, sampled,

digitized and memorised at the said desampling and de-digitizing
frequency, then re-read at the said sampling frequency.
Method according to Claim 1, in which the signal emitted
is, subsequent to its de-digitization, transposed in frequency

in a band compatible with the emitter.
Method according to Claim 2, in which the transposition
of frequency is carried out by modulation of a carrier and

emission on a single lateral band.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the
signal received is, prior to its sampling and its digitization,

transposed in frequency in a band compatible with the memorising
means.
Method according to Claim 4, in which the transposition
is carried out by modulation of a carrier, only one of the

lateral bands resulting therefrom then being sampled and
digitized.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in which the re-read
signal is used to modulate a carrier, one of the lateral

bands resulting therefrom forming the reconstituted signal.
Method according to Claim 6, in which the frequency of the
carrier is adjustable.
Device for improving the intelligibility of acoustic 
undersea transmissions, characterised by the fact that it

comprises, on its emission channel, means (18-22) for spreading
over time of the signal to be emitte
d, by a predetermined factor,
and, on its reception channel, means (18-22) for compressing over

time the signal received by an inverse factor.
Device according to Claim 8, in which the means for
spreading over time and the means for compression over time

comprise sampling and digitization means (19), a digital memory
(20) and means (21) for de-digitization and de-sampling.
Device according to one of Claims 8 and 9, furthermore
comprising, means (24, 26) for the transposition of frequency of

the signal to be emitted.
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 10, furthermore
comprising means (29, 30) for the transposition of frequency of

the signal received.
Device according to one of Claims 10 and 11, in which the
means for transposition of frequency comprise means (24, 29) for

modulating a carrier and a filter (26, 30) able to eliminate one
of the lateral bands resulting from the modulation.
Device according to Claim 12, comprising means (25) for
regulating the frequency of the carrier.
