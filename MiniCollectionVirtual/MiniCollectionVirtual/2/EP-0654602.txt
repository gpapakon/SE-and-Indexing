<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (18) for mounting an air-assisted fuel injector (10) on an 
engine is a one-piece molded plastic part that includes an integral assist-air 

supply tube (32) through which assist air enters the adapter and integral 
attaching catches (34,36,38,40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel-injectors for internal combustion
engines, particularly fuel injectors having air-assist nozzles for
enhancing atomization of fuel as it is being injected.In some engines requiring air-assisted fuel injectors, the
injectors are mounted in an air-assist manifold that serves all
injectors. In other engines, assist air may be fed to each injector
through its own tube. In both, there is a need for adaptation to the
engine so that leakage is avoided.A number of patents disclose various forms of individual
adapters for individually mounting an air-assist type fuel injector
on an engine. For example, please refer to U.S. patent No.
5,218,943. One known adapter comprises a metal receptacle for
receiving the nozzle end of a fuel injector and a metal tube that is
joined by a process such as brazing, welding, etc. to a hole in the
sidewall of the receptacle for communicating assist air to an axially
sealed zone inside the receptacle surrounding assist air entrances of
the air-assist nozzle.Another known form of adapter is disclosed in German patent
application DE 42 05 709. The air-assist adapter comprises a one-piece
body which enshrouds a nozzle. A single air-assist orifice is
located directly beneath the nozzle. An air-assist tube is provided 
in a wall of the adapter for conveying air from an external source.
The adapter is provided with catch means for securing the adapter
to the fuel injector.While the use of metal parts in an adapter may be acceptable,
care must be taken during the fabrication process to guard against
the creation of sharp edges, burrs, weld spatter, etc., which may
have the potential for damaging seals that are necessary in order to
provide proper sealing of the injector to the adapter to the engine.
Likewise, care must be exercised to assure compliance with the
typically tight tolerances that are involved in fitting to an injector
and to an engine. Naturally, these measures may be reasonably
anticipated to add the cost of the adapter and its installation.
Avoidance of these measures is apt to make an air-assist fuel
injection system more competitive.Development of a fuel injection system for an engine may
involve substitution of parts in order to arrive at the best possible
combination. The ability to quickly and conveniently make
substitutions of fuel injector system components should contribute
to a decrease in the development time and should enhance the
ability to substitute fuel injector system components at any time,
such as after the engine has gone
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An adapter (18) for an air-assist fuel injector (10) which comprises a
nozzle (14) including a plurality of air-assist entrances (16) for receiving

assist air into the fuel injector (10) for mixing with fuel therein, the adapter
(18) comprising :-


a tubular body (20) having main wall means (22) circumferentially
girdling a main through-bore (24) in which a portion of the injector (10)

including the air-assist entrances (16) is mounted;
resilient catch means (34, 36, 38, 40) for securing the tubular body
(20) to the fuel injector (10), the catch means (34, 36, 38, 40) providing a

snap-on, snap-off attachment with the fuel injector (10);
axially spaced apart seals (26, 28) acting between the main wall
means (22) and the fuel injector (10) to define an annular zone (30) around

the air-assist entrances (16); and
tube means (32) connected to the wall means (22) and in fluid
communication with the annular zone (30) to convey assist air from an

external source thereto;

characterised in that the resilient catch means (34, 36, 38, 40)
comprises a plurality of fingers (34, 36) which project from the wall means

(22), the fingers (34, 36) being circumferentially distributed about the
tubular body (20), and in that the tubular body (20) further comprises a

plurality of wall sections (44, 46) circumferentially distributed thereabout
which join with and extend axially of the main wall means (22), the wall

sections (44, 46) being circumferentially interdigitated with the fingers (34,
36) and extend further from the main wall means (22) than the fingers (34,

36).
An adapter according to claim 1, wherein the tubular body (20)
comprises a plastic material, the catch means (34, 36, 38, 40) being

integrally formed with the tubular body (20).
