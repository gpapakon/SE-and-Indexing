<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides novel copolycarbonates that exhibit improvements in glass transition temperature, refractive index, and limiting oxygen index compared to prior art thiodiphenol/bisphenol A copolycarbonates. The copolycarbonates of this invention comprise the reaction products of 4,4'-thiodiphenol and compounds such as 9,9-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) fluorene with phosgene. They are useful as components of multilayered polymeric reflective bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to copolycarbonates;
their method of preparation; their use in
preparing improved polymeric bodies; and the improved
polymeric bodies. More specifically, the invention
concerns novel 4,4'-thiodiphenol (TDP) copolycarbonates
having properties that make them particularly suitable
for preparing certain types of multilayered polymeric
bodies.U.S. Patents 5,122,905 and 5,122,906 teach the
use of polycarbonates in preparing highly reflective
multilayered polymeric bodies. The only polycarbonate
it specifically discloses in its Examples is a
homopolycarbonate of bisphenol A (Calibre 300-22,
trademark of The Dow Chemical Company). We concluded
that it would be desirable to provide materials with
improvements in glass transition temperature (Tg),
refractive index (RI), and limiting oxygen index (LOI).
Such materials would significantly expand the
application areas for the multilayered polymeric bodies.In addition, several recent published patent
applications teach the use of (previously known)
copolycarbonates of 4,4'-thiodiphenol (TDP) and
bisphenol A (BA) as the high refractive index (RI)
component of a multilayered polymeric reflective body.Copolycarbonates of 4,4'-thiodiphenol and a second dihydroxy compound are known from US-A-4 426 514 and FR-A-2 377 267.This invention provides novel copolycarbonates
that typically exhibit the desired improvements in Tg,
RI, and LOI compared to the prior art TDP/BA copolycarbonates 
(and BA homopolycarbonates). More particularly,
this invention provides novel copolycarbonates of TDP
and
9,9-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) fluorene (BHPF).A first broad aspect of the invention is a
copolycarbonate of 4,4'-thiodiphenol and
9,9-bis (4-hydroxy-phenyl)
fluorene.A second broad aspect of the invention is a
multilayered polymeric reflective body wherein the
highest refractive index component is a copolycarbonate
of 4,4'-thiodiphenol and
9,9-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) fluorene.A third broad aspect of the invention is a
process for making copolycarbonates comprising reacting
4,4'-thiodiphenol and
9,9-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) fluorene
with a
carbonate precursor under conditions sufficient to cause
reaction. In the practice of this invention
advantageously the copolycarbonate of TDP and BHPF comprises from 10 to 80 mole percent of
the dihydroxy units derived from TDP.
Methods of producing polycarbonates are well known in
the prior art. Such methods are also suitable for use
in forming the copolycarbonate compositions of the
present invention. Suitable methods for
