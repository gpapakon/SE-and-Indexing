<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aluminoxy products. The term
organo-aluminoxy as used herein refers to organic compounds having a
plurality of aluminum atoms each bound to at least two oxygen atoms. In
another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of modifying
organic aluminoxanes to make them suitable for use in particle form
polymerization. In still another aspect, the present invention relates to
a metallocene catalyst comprising a modified organic aluminoxane. In still
another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for polymerizing
olefins using the modified organic aluminoxane.Organic aluminoxanes are one form of aluminoxy compound. Organic
aluminoxanes can be produced by the partial hydrolysis of hydrocarbyl
aluminum compounds. Such aluminoxanes have been found useful in a variety
of chemical reactions, including utility as catalyst components for
polymerization catalysts, especially in high activity metallocene catalyst
systems.The combination of such aluminoxanes with metallocenes has been
shown to be useful for certain types of olefin polymerization. One of the 
earliest patents containing such a disclosure is U.S. 3,242,099.
Such metallocene
catalysts have been used in homogeneous solution polymerization. Since
such homogeneous catalyst systems are soluble in the polymerization medium
it is generally observed that the resulting polymer has low bulk density.Further, attempts to use metallocene/aluminoxane catalysts in a
slurry or particle form type polymerization have not heretofore been found
to be commercially feasible. In slurry or particle form polymerization,
the polymerization conditions are selected such that the polymer forms as
discrete particles which are insoluble in the polymerization reaction
medium during the polymerization. It has been observed that when such
particle form polymerizations are carried out in the presence of a
metallocene/aluminoxane catalyst system, large amounts of polymeric
material are formed on the surfaces of the polymerization vessel. This
fouling is particularly detrimental in a particle form process since it
produces an adverse effect on the heat transfer and also results in the
need for periodic if not continuous cleaning of the reactor. In order to
have a metallocene/aluminoxane catalyst useful in a commercial continuous
particle form process such a those using a loop reactor, it is necessary
to have a catalyst system which will not cause significant amounts of
reactor fouling.It is known that a solid form of aluminoxane can be
