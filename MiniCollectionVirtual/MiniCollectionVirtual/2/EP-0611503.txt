<ABSTRACT>
A cellular radio system comprises cells or cell groups (A1 to A3, B1, B2) complementing the network capacity locally. These cells or cell groups have not been presented as neighbouring cells for the surrounding network. This means that a mobile station (MS) of the cellular radio network will not at any stage become aware of these complementary separate radio coverage islands (A, B) on the basis of the neighbouring cell information received from a base station (BTS1 to BTS9). The coverage of these separate cells and cell groups (A1 to A3, B1, B2) may topologically overlap the other cells (C1 to C9) of the cellular radio network. An access of the mobile station (MS) to the cells of a complementary system is based on its a priori information of at which frequencies such a complementary radio coverage may be found (depending on the location of the mobile station). At least part of the mobile stations have then an automatic or user-operated facility of scanning these frequencies. Moreover, various checkings of access rights and various priority systems may be associated with the use of the complementary systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cellular radio systems
and especially to a cellular radio network concept,
which facilitates the planning of the cellular radio
network.Careful frequency planning is required for
building up a cellular network based on frequency
division multiple access (FDMA or TDMA/FDMA principle).
The basic idea in cellular networks is to
reuse the same frequencies over and over again in
order to make a limited band of frequencies to serve
a large number of users. Normally the frequency reuse
is implemented so as to obtain the highest possible
capacity from a frequency band available. A cellular
network is typically planned as a monolithic unity,
and therefore, any change in the transceivers of the
network (installation of a new transceiver, change of
operating frequency) requires a checking of the frequency
planning of the entire network.Except by frequency planning, the radio system
of a cellular network is made monolithic by network
configuration information. Neighbouring cells are
assigned for each cell, and a list of neighbouring
cells is transmitted continuously on a broadcasting
channel of the cell to the mobile stations. Based on
this system information, mobile stations in idle
state monitor the field strength of the current cell
and the neighbouring cells and select a new cell if
the field strength of the current cell becomes too
weak. In the same way, mobile stations having an ongoing
call via a base station of a serving cell are 
capable of monitoring the field strength of the assigned
neighbouring cells. On the basis of the obtained
field strength information it is possible to
make handover decisions in the cellular radio network.
The neighbouring cells are defined by means of
their frequencies. The transmission of the network
configuration information on the broadcasting channel
of the cell is an essential precondition of an operation
of a conventional cellular radio system, making
it possible to maintain an uninterrupted connection
between the fixed network and the roaming mobile stations.Planning a radio network is a laborious measure.
Due to the costs, the risks caused for the network
operation as a whole, the seriousness of changes
to be made in an operating network and the rather
long time needed for the whole operation, an existing
radio network configuration will not be modified
without strong arguments. The operation of the network
and business activities utilizing the network
must be adapted to the reality that an implementation
of a radio network cannot be changed

A cellular radio system comprising a cellular radio
network with mobile radio stations (MS), the base

stations of the cells (C1 to C9) of the cellular network
broadcasting information about their neighbouring cells,

whereby a mobile station monitors the radio coverage of
the neighbouring cells and performs a reregistration in

idle state or forwards measuring data to the cellular
radio network for a handover decision during a call,

characterized in that

the cellular radio network comprises at least one
separate subsystem (A, B) consisting of at least one

cell (A1 to A3, B1 to B2) such that cells belonging to
said subsystem are not presented as neighbouring cells

by cells not belonging to said subsystem,
said at least one subsystem (A, B) utilizes
predetermined frequencies,

   at least some of the mobile stations (MS) comprise:

means for storing in a memory information about the
frequencies at which said at least one subsystem (A, B)

may occur and for reading that information from the
memory,
means for measuring, in addition to the signals at
the neighbouring of the cell, signals at said

frequencies stored in the memory, and
means for treating a cell of said at least one
subsystem (A, B) offering sufficient radio coverage in

the same way as it treats the neighbouring cell for the
reregistration in idle state or for the handover

decision during a call.
A system according to claim 1, characterized in
that the mobile station (MS) comprises means for

activating a measurement of signals at frequencies
utilized by said at least one subsystem (A, B) either
 by
the user or automatically periodically and for 

terminating the measurements if no signal is observed at
said frequencies.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a list of radio channels utilized by said at

least one subsystem (A, B) is stored in the mobile
station (MS), preferably in a subscriber-specific

replaceable memory means, such as a smart card or an
electronic memory module.
A system according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that each separate subsystem (A; B) is

configurated to be at least one separate location area
(LAA; LAB), which does not contain a single cell of

another separate subsystem or such a cell that does not
belong to any separate subsystem,


each subscriber of the system is authorized to
access either cells not belonging to the subsystems or

cells of at least one subsystem or both,
the network comprises means (HLR;VLR) for
maintaining said access rights information of the

subscriber,
in connection with a location updating concerning a
location area corresponding to a subsystem (A, B), the

network checks the access rights of a mobile station
trying to perform a location updating or a subscriber

utilizing the mobile station to access the subsystem in
question and prevents a location updating of an

unauthorized mobile station or subscriber.
A system according to claim 4, characterized in

(A, B) are defined indirectly in such a way that a
membership of a subscriber in particular user groups is

defined and it is also defined which user groups have
the rights to access such subsystem.

reregistration or a handover from the subsystem to cells

(A, B) have a higher priority in the reregistration
decision of the mobile station than the other cells in

such a way that a mobile station (MS) currently
registered to the subsystem primarily tries to stay

there and a mobile station currently registered outside
the subsystem primarily tries to reregister to such a

subsystem.
A system according to any of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that cells belonging to a subsystem

(A; B) have a higher priority in the handover decision
of the mobile station than the other cells in such a way

that the network primarily tries to keep the mobile

and, when a possibility for a handover turns up,

primarily tries to move the mobile stations registered
outside the subsystem and being authorized to access the

subsystem to the subsystem.
A system according to any of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that different frequencies have been

assigned for cells belonging to subsystems (A; B) and
for cells not belonging to them.
