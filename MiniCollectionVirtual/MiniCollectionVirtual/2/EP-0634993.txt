<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in the production of cyclohexanol and 
cyclohexanone by the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide. Mixtures of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and cyclohexyl hydroperoxide are the 
reaction product of the air oxidation of cyclohexane. Cyclohexyl hydroperoxide can be 
hydrogenated to produce cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol; see, for example, US Patent 
4,720,592 to Besmar et al., or cyclohexyl hydroperoxide can be decomposed by 
neutralizing the acids contained in the mixture with an alkali metal hydroxide, and then 
reacting it with excess free metal hydroxide and metal salts that cause it to decompose 
to form cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, but the reaction does not produce these 
products in quantitative yield and other waste products are also produced: see US 
Patent 4,720,592, column 1, lines 43-50, and US Patent 4,238,415 to Bryan. 
Cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone can be further oxidized, for example, with nitric acid, 
to form adipic acid. Adipic acid is one of the principal ingredients used in the 
production of nylon. The use of static mixers in the treatment of air oxidation products of 
cyclohexane is shown in US Patent 4,720,592 to Besmar et al. GB-A-1382849 discloses a process for oxidizing cyclohexane with air. The 
resulting mixture which would contain cyclohexyl peroxide, cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, 
cyclohexanone and aqueous caustic soda is then treated with a metal salt, such as a 
cobalt compound to accelerate the conversion of the peroxide. An object of the present invention is to provide a high rate process for 
decomposing cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to form cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and 
only very small amounts of waste products.  
 The present invention is a process for the conversion of cyclohexyl 
hydroperoxide contained in a mixture with cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol 
and aqueous caustic, to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which comprise adding a 
metal salt that accelerates the caustic catalyzed decomposition of cyclohexyl 
hydroperoxide and subjecting the mixture to turbulent high-intensity mixing to create a 
dispersed phase drop size of between 50 to 500 microns, for a time of between 3 and 45 
seconds (preferably between 3 and 25 seconds) at a temperature between 100 and 140 
degrees C, and then subjecting the mixture to a non-turbulent decantation.  
 Due to the formation of a dispersed phase having a drop size 
between 50 and 500 microns it is possible to complete the reaction quickly. The 
reaction speed is increased

<CLAIMS>
A process for the conversion of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide contained in a 
mixture with cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol and aqueous caustic, to 

cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, by adding to said mixture a metal salt that accelerates 
the decomposition of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, characterized by subjecting the mixture 

to turbulent high-intensity mixing to create a dispersed phase drop size of between 50 
to 500 microns, for a time of between 3 and 45 seconds at a temperature between 100 

and 140 degrees C, and then subjecting the mixture to a non-turbulent decantation. 
The process of claim 1 in which the turbulent high-intensity mixing takes 
place in a static mixer, and the dispersed phase drop size is ca. 100 microns. 
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 in which the metal in the metal salt is 
selected from the group consisting of cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, and vanadium. 
The process of claim 3 in which the metal salt concentration is in the 
range of 0.1 to 50 ppm by weight of the mixture.
