<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device (21) switches its operation mode 
in accordance with the type of an installed battery pack 

(22). The battery pack (22) has a regulator (222), a 
specification-discriminating terminal (TJ), and a resistor 

(224), connected between the regulator (222) and the 
specification-discriminating terminal (TJ) and having a 

resistance corresponding to the specification of the 
incorporated battery (221). The electronic device (21) 

has a monitor resistor (214) connected between a terminal 
(TL) connected to the specification-discriminating 

terminal (TJ) of the battery pack (22) and ground, a 
discriminating circuit (212, 215, 216) for detecting a 

monitor voltage generated across this monitor resistor 
(214) to discriminate the specification of the battery 

(221), and a switch controller (212, 219) for switching 
the operation mode in accordance with the specification 

discriminated by the discriminating circuit (212, 215, 
216).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic device
which uses a detachable battery pack as its power supply,
such as portable radio communication equipment, a
battery pack, a charger for the battery pack and their
peripheral devices.Portable radio communication devices use a
detachable battery pack as a power supply. Plural types
of battery packs are available for such portable radio
communication equipment in view of the portability and
power-supply efficiency of the equipment. Each battery
pack incorporates one of batteries of different
specifications (voltage or current capacities). The
batteries include a nickel-cadmium battery, an alkaline
battery, and a manganese battery. Generally, the nickel-cadmium
battery which is rechargeable is used.Portable radio communication devices have several
usage modes, a standard usage mode, prolonged usage mode,
high-power usage mode and prolonged high-power usage mode.
A battery pack for the standard use incorporates a
standard battery, a battery pack for the prolonged use
incorporates a battery which has a large capacity, a
battery pack for the high-power use incorporates a battery
which outputs a high voltage, and a battery pack for the
prolonged high-power use incorporates a battery which has
a large capacity and outputs a high voltage.Portable radio communication equipment which uses a
battery pack has a function of automatically
discriminating the type of the battery incorporated in the
installed battery pack and switching the operation mode
(operation parameter) to the one that matches with the
battery type.When the battery in the battery pack is of a
rechargeable type, it is necessary to select a charging
power supply appropriate for the battery type to charge 
the rechargeable battery. A conventional charger for
battery packs therefore has a plurality of charging power
supply circuits, automatically discriminates the type of
installed battery pack and selects the charging power
supply circuit that matches with the battery pack to
charge the incorporated battery.FIG. 6 shows the structures of a portable radio
communication device, battery packs and a charger for
the battery packs according to the prior art.In FIG. 6, battery packs 121, 122 and 123
respectively incorporate rechargeable batteries A1, A2 and
A3 of different specifications (rated: current
capacities/output voltages/charging voltages), and each
have output terminals TB1, TB2, TB3 and TC and charging
input terminals TD1, TD2, TD3 and TE.The positive electrode of the battery A1 in the first
