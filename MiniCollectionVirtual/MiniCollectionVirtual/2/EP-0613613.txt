<ABSTRACT>
Fertilizer broadcaster with a frame (1), a supply container (3) and metering members (14), under which are arranged centrifugal discs (4) driven in rotation on the frame (1) and equipped with throw-shovels (5, 6). As a result of the relative movement of the metering member (14) and centrifugal disc (4) in relation to one another, the feed surface of the fertilizer, metered to the centrifugal disc (4) by the metering member (14), is displaceable on the centrifugal disc (4). So that the fertilizer broadcaster can be set in a simple way from one working width to another and/or to another type of discharge, such as from normal spreading to marginal spreading, and vice versa, provision is made for the feed surface to be displaceable or adjustable into at least two fixed or fixable positions (Figure 2).
