<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses devices and methods of performing high-throughput screening of the physiological response of cells to biologically active compounds and methods of combining high-throughput with high-content spatial information at the cellular and subcellular level as well as temporal information about changes in physiological, biochemical and molecular activities. The present invention allows multiple types of cell interactions to be studied simultaneously by combining multicolor luminescence reading, microfluidic delivery, and environmental control of living cells in non-uniform micro-patterned arrays.

<DESCRIPTION>
Miniaturized Cell Array Methods and Apparatus for Cell-Based ScreeningRelated ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Provisional Application for Patent S/N 60/018,696, filed May 30, 1996, and U.S. Application for Patent S/N 08/810983, filed on February 27, 1997, which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods and apparatus for high throughput and high biological content screening of a non-uniform micro- patterned array of cells on a base.Description of the Prior ArtIn the expanding arena of drug discovery and combinatorial chemistry to generate candidate compounds, it would be very useful to be able to rapidly screen a large number of substances, via a high throughput screen, for their physiological impact on animals and humans. Before testing the efficacy of a "partially qualified" drug candidate on animals, the drug could first be screened for its biological activity and potential toxicity with living cells prior to testing in an animal model. The anticipated physiological response to the drug candidate could then be based on the results of these cell screens.Traditionally, "lead compounds" have moved quickly to extensive animal studies which are both time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, 

extensive drug testing in animals is becoming less and less culturally acceptable in the United States and Europe. Screening drug candidates according to their interaction with living cells, prior to animal studies, can reduce the number of animals required in subsequent drug screening processes by eliminating some drug candidates before going to animal trials. However, manipulation and analysis of drug-cell interactions using current methods does not allow for both high throughput and high biological content screening, due to the small number of cells and compounds that can be analyzed in a given period of time, the cumbersome methods required for compound delivery, and the large volumes of compounds required for testing.High throughput screening of nucleic acids and polypeptides has been achieved through a technique known as combinatorial chemistry. In typical combinatorial chemistry methods, DNA sequences of 10 to 14 base pairs are attached in defined locations (or spots), up to tens of thousands in number, on a small glass plate. (U.S. Patent No. 5,556,752, hereby incoÏ†orated by reference). This creates an array of spots of DNA on a given glass plate. The location of a spot in the array provides an address
