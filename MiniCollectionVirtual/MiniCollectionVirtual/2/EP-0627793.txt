<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection assembly which has at least two superposed connection elements (1, 2), respectively an upper and lower connection element, each having a shell, an insulating central body, and a plurality of right-angled (elbowed) contacts (50) placed in the insulating central body, as well as superposition elements in order to maintain the two connection elements in a given nominal superposition position. The superposition elements are constituted by plates (40) comprising an upper part (47) comprising a first retention element (33) integral with the upper connection element (1) by forcible insertion and a lower part (48) comprising a second retention element (31) integral with the lower connection element (2) by forcible insertion.
