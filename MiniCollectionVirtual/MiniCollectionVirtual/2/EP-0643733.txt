<DESCRIPTION>
 HARD THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERSThe present invention relates generally to the production of thermoplastic polyurethane ("TPU") elastomers and polyurea elastomers having high hardness and, more specifically, to the production of elastomers utilizing a polyol blend containing a low unsaturation level polyol prepared using a double metal cyanide complex catalyst.The use of double metal cyanide (so-called "DMC") catalysts in the preparation of high molecular weight polyols is well-established in the art. For example,U.S. Patent 3,829,505, assigned to General Tire & Rubber Company, discloses the preparation of high molecular weight diols, triols etc., using these catalysts. The polyols prepared using these catalysts can be fabricated to have a higher molecular weight and a lower amount of end group unsaturation than can be prepared using commonly-used KOH catalysts. The '505 patent discloses that these high molecular weight polyol products are useful in the preparation of nonionic surface active agents, lubricants and coolants, textile sizes, packaging films, as well as in the preparation of solid or flexible polyurethanes by reaction with polyisocyanates.Certain thermoset polyurethane elastomers produced using triols made by DMC catalysis are also known. More specifically, U.S. Patent 4,242,490 

discloses the preparation of such elastomers by reacting a DMC catalyst-prepared polypropylene ether triol having a molecular weight of from 7,000 to 14,000, ethylene glycol, and toluene diisocyanate in a specified range of molar ratios using either a prepolymer process or a "one-shot" process.Methodology for preparing TPU elastomers is well-established in the art. By way of illustration, U.S. Patent 4,202,957 discloses polyurethane polyether-based elastomers, made using a select group of polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide block copolymers, which this patent states are thermoplastic, recyclable and possess high temperature degradation resistance thus permitting fabrication by injection molding. As another illustration, U.S. Patent 5,096,993 discloses the production of TPU elastomers made using DMC-prepared polyether polyols. These elastomers are disclosed in the *993 patent as having excellent physical and chemical properties. Unfortunately, hard TPU elastomers, such as those elastomers having a hardness within the range of between 75 Shore A and about 75 Shore D, prepared in accordance with prior art methods utilizing a DMC-prepared polyol are generally not as readily extruded into shaped articles
