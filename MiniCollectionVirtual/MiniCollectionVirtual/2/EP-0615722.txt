<ABSTRACT>
A cuff for a blood pressure meter including material 
that does not stretch and in which the length of the 

surface in contact with the finger would not vary when 
the cuff was filled with compressed air, regardless of 

the diameter of the finger, is provided. The internal 
pressure in the cuff closely approximates the blood 

pressure of the finger, and thereby the device is 
accurate. Compressed air is pumped into chambers (6) formed 

by a basic structure (1) and containment walls (2). Folded 
portions (3) which are provided on containment walls (2) cause 

surfaces (21) of the containment walls which contact the 
object to be measured to remain parallel to protruding 

bodies (12) located on basic structure as they are displaced 
by inflation of the chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a cuff used to measure blood
pressure. More specifically, it concerns a cuff for a
blood pressure meter which measures blood pressure when
applied to a finger.Fig. 16 is a perspective view of a conventional
finger blood pressure meter. Fig. 17 is a cross-sectional
view of a conventional blood pressure meter
finger cuff. Several types of designs of finger cuffs
are currently available.The finger cuff shown in Fig. 17 has a wrapper
constituting a sheet (or membrane) made of rubber or a
soft plastic which is folded over on itself. Chamber
501, which contains compressed air, is formed by welding
or bonding the ends of this sheet. Generally, the
outside of chamber 501 has strips of cloth around its top
and bottom ends which cause it to assume the shape of a
cylinder when inflated. Cylindrical cuff or chamber 501,
is enclosed within cylindrical case 500.To measure a patient's blood pressure, the patient
inserts his finger into the cylindrical cuff 501. When
chamber 501 is filled with compressed air via the air
tube connected to it, it expands like a balloon, adhering
to and pressing against the finger. The blood pressure
is measured by obstructing the flow of blood in the
artery of the finger.As seen in Fig. 16, the finger 400 inserted in the
cylindrical cuff does not touch anything outside of the
cuff nor does it rest on a fixed member or support. A
patient often bends his finger, thus not relaxing the 
finger for an accurate measurement because there is no
support on which the patient can rest his finger. As a
result of the tension in the finger, inaccurate blood
pressure measurements are taken.In the conventional blood pressure finger cuff
described above, the range of finger sizes to which the
cuff can be applied properly is limited. If a person's
finger size happens to match the finger cuff size,
pressure would be applied to the finger as the
cylindrical cuff or chamber is filled with compressed
air. If the finger to be measured does not match the
finger cuff size, but is, for example, thinner than the
finger size optimal for the finger cuff, the chamber is
stretched and deformed by the pressure applied by the
compressed air before the cuff is expanded enough to
cause its surface to press against the finger. The
tension caused by the deformation of the chamber affects
the pressure inside the finger cuff, and the pressure
applied to the finger is reduced. If pressurization were
continued while the chamber was deformed, the sum of the
pressure against the finger and the pressure
