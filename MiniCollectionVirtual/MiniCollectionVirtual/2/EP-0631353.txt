<ABSTRACT>
A chalcogenide glass that is doped with praseodymium and contains a 
rare earth metal is disclosed. The rare earth metal is at least 10 mole percent of the 

metals in the glass. The concentration of the praseodymium in the glass is at least

transmission system, efficiently amplifies optical signals in the signal band of 
1.3 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a rare-earth metal containing glass suitable 
for use in making optical signal amplifiers for long distance optical transmission 
systems. Optical fiber transmission systems typically contain electronic repeaters 
to transmit the optical signal over long distances. Optical fiber amplifiers are 
emerging as an alternative way in which to amplify optical signals in these 
transmission systems. The erbium-doped amplifier, for example, amplifies optical 
signals in transmission systems such as ultra-long distance systems, large capacity 
CATV systems and optical soliton transmission systems. These systems transmit 
optical signals that have a wavelength that is within the 1.5 µm region. Most 
terrestrial optical fiber transmission systems transmit optical signals in the 1.3 µm 
region, however. Optical fiber amplifiers do not amplify optical signals of every 
wavelength. The erbium-doped amplifiers described above are not suited for 
amplifying optical signals in the 1.3 µm range. Amplifiers are therefore sought for 
transmission systems that amplify optical signals in the 1.3 µm region. 
Praseodymium (Pr) doped fluoride amplifiers (PDFA) have been observed to amplify 
optical signals in the 1.3 µm range. PDFAs, and other optical signal amplifiers, are doped glass materials 
with certain optical properties. Praseodymium-doped fluorozirconate glass 
(ZBLAN), for example, has been observed to yield a large gain, about 30 dB, at 
1.31 µm. Shimzu, Makoto, et al.,"28.3 dB Gain Pr-Doped Fluoride Fiber Amplifier 
Module Pumped by 1.017 µm InGaAs-LDs," Proc.OSC/IOOC, PD-12, San Jose, 
CA., 1993. The Pr⁺³ is first excited so that a higher energy state is sufficiently 
populated. The relaxation of the Pr⁺³ from this higher energy state results in the 
photon emission necessary for the amplification of the 1.3 µm range optical signal. The relaxation transition of interest which the Pr⁺³ undergoes is from 
¹G₄ to ³H₅. The lifetime of Pr⁺³ in the ¹G₄ level is short, however. It is reported 
to be 110 microseconds in ZBLAN, and is limited by non-radiative decay. Ohishi, 
Y., et al., Optical Letters, 16:1747 (1991). Pedersen, B., et al., "Optimization of 
Pr³⁺:ZBLAN fiber Amplifiers," IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 4(5):446 (May 
1992) observe that the small signal gain increases with numerical aperture and pump 
power when the wavelength of the optical signal to the amplifier is 1310 nm  
 
(1.31 µm). According to Pedersen et al., the pump power needed to get a 30 dB 
signal gain from the
