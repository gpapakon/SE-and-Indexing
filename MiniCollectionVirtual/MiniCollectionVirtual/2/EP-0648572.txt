<ABSTRACT>
Device (3) for inserting a cylindrical piece (1) into a bore (2), comprising a support (5, 30) for a piece holder (6, 31) having a main axis, the piece holder (6, 31) comprising means (8, 33) for its sliding connection, along in the direction of the main axis, to the support, and controlled (driven) means (14, 16, 17) for keeping the cylindrical piece (1) substantially coaxial with the main axis of the support (5, 30), the support being carried by a controller (manipulator) (4) capable of moving its main axis close to the axis of the bore (2), while means are provided for generating a relative vibratory movement between the bore (2) and the piece holder (6, 31), the means for connecting the piece holder (6, 31) to the support (5, 30) comprising a ball joint (7, 32) and in that the vibration-generating means consist of an unbalanced mass carried by the piece holder (6, 31) and can move with respect to the main axis of the support (5, 30) in a plane substantially perpendicular to the latter.

A device (3) for inserting a cylindrical part (1) into a bore (2),
the device comprising a support (5, 30) for a part-carrier (6, 31)

having a main axis, the part-carrier (6, 31) having means (8, 33) for
slidably connecting it along the direction of the main axis with the

support, and controlled means (14, 16, 17) for holding the
cylindrical part (1) substantially on the main axis of the support

(5, 30), the support being carried by a manipulator (4) capable of
placing its main axis in the vicinity of the axis of the bore (2)

while means are provided for generating relative vibratory motion
between the bore (2) and the part-carrier (6, 31), the device being

characterized in that the means linking the part-carrier (6, 31) to
the support (5, 30) include a ball type joint (7, 32), and in that

the vibration generating means are constituted by an out-of-balance
mass carried by the part-carrier (6, 31) and movable relative to the

main axis of the support (5, 30) in a plane that is substantially
perpendicular thereto.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the out-of-balance
mass is constituted by a ball propelled along a circular path

(13) situated in the part-carrier (6, 31) in the vicinity of the
means (14, 16, 17) for holding the part.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that
the support and the part-carrier comprise a cylindrical element (5,

31) covering with determined clearance a cylindrical element (6, 30),
said elements being connected to each other at their inside ends by

means of an axial guide (8, 33) and a ball joint (7, 32) allowing
limited relative translation between the two elements along their

axes and limited relative oscillation of their axes.
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that between the
two elements (6, 5; 30, 31) it includes at least one intermediate

element (10, 35, 50) exerting between the two cylindrical elements a
force that partially balances the effect of gravity. 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in
that the ball is propelled along the path (13) by pneumatic means

(18, 19).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the means for holding the part comprise a suction nozzle (16) for

sucking a surface of the part against a corresponding surface (14) of
the part-carrier (6, 31).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the support incl
udes a fixed cylindrical core (30) fitted at its top
end with means (34) for fixing it to the manipulator (4) and provided

along its axis with a guide bore for a coupling rod (33) of the part-carrier
of the support, said part-carrier including a jacket (31)

surrounding the support and fitted at its bottom end with the means
(14, 16, 17) for holding the part, and the out-of-balance mass, while

its top end is coupled to the rod (33) by means of a set of three
concentric rings (40, 41, 42) in which the intermediate ring (41) is

hinged to the outer ring (42) secured to the jacket (31) about a
first diametral axis (45, 46) and to the central ring (40) secured to

the rod (33) about a second diametral axis (43, 44) perpendicular to
the first, the central ring (40) having the means (34) for fixing the

support (30) to the manipulator (4) passing therethrough.
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that the rod (33)
and the bore of the core (30) define, at the end of the rod remote

from its end coupled to the jacket (31) a substantially sealed
chamber (50) which includes an orifice (51) for connection to a

source of compressed gas.
A device according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that at least
one of the hinges (43, 44) between the intermediate ring (41) and the

peripheral rings (40, 42) includes a resilient brake (54) exerting a
return torque between the support (30) and the part-carrier (31).
A device according to claim 9, characterized in that the brake
(54) is constituted by resilient abutment means carried by the 

intermediate ring (41) and bearing against the rod (33) outside the
jacket in a direction parallel to one of the hinge axes (45, 46) of

said intermediate ring (41).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
it includes means (21) for establishing suction in the volume of the

bore (2) that is to receive the cylindrical part (1), at least from
the moment that insertion has started.
