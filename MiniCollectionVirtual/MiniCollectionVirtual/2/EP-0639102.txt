<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of separating from a base liquid, particles contained therein by introducing the base liquid between facing rotating surfaces which are imparted mutually different speeds of rotation relatively to the environment. The method is carried out in a container (1; 101; 201) holding the liquid and wherein the two facing surfaces are rotationally symmetrical about an axis and preferably are in contact with said liquid in their entirety, whereby said surfaces are used for radial boundary-layer transportation of the particles to be separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns 
a device for separation from a base liquid of particles
and other substances contained therein, the particles and
other substances having a density deviating from a density
of the base liquid, the device comprising a container
adapted for reception and through-flow therein of a
particle-laden liquid, said container having an inlet for
supply of said particle-laden liquid, an outlet for discharge
of cleaned liquid and at least an outlet for discharge
of separated particles and other substances, discs
located at the interior of the container and formed with
faces positioned opposite each other in at least one pair
of faces and having an extended projection in a plane at
right angles to the axis of rotation, and about which
axis the faces are rotationally symmetrical, and means
arranged to impart to the faces of each individual pair
of faces rotational movement of mutually different
speeds.A device of this kind is shown in DE-650 704.
In US-3 764 007 a similar device is described. The
devices according to said patents only comprise one pair
of discs and one of these discs is stationary and the
other one is rotated by a shaft. This resuls in that
boundary-layer flows are created along the discs and
therefore, particles are separated from the base liquid.
The devices according to D1 and D2 have only one outlet
for discharge of the particles and the inlet and the
outlet for supply and discharge of the liquid are
arranged relatively close to the outlet for the
separated particles by comparison with the invention.
Said features of these devices will
result in that only a small amount of liquid could be
cleaned during a certain time period and that the
separated particles most likely will be mixed with the
cleaned liquid in connection with the discharge of the
particles and liquid. Thus, the main purpose of the invention is to make it
possible to separate, by simple means, such particles from
the base liquid in an efficient manner.This purpose is achieved in accordance with the
invention with the aid of the device
defined in the characterizing clause of
claim 1.The present
invention will be described
in the following with reference to the accompanying
drawings, wherein:
Fig 1 is a schematic vertical cross-sectional view
through a first reference device primarily intended to separate light
pollutants from a base liquid;Fig. 2 is a corresponding vertical cross-sectional
view through a first embodiment of the device

<CLAIMS>
A device for separation from a base liquid of
particles and other substances contained therein, the

particles and other substances having a density deviating
from a density of the base liquid, the device comprising

a container (101) adapted for reception and through-flow
therein of a particle-laden liquid, said container having

an inlet (113) for supply of said particle-laden liquid,
an outlet (114) for discharge of cleaned liquid and at

least an outlet (110, 111) for discharge of separated
particles and other substances, at least one pair of discs

(143, 144; 343, 344) located at the interior of the container
and formed with faces positioned opposite each other, the

axis of rotation of said discs being at right angles to the
plane of said discs, and about which

axis the faces of said discs are rotationally symmetrical, and
means (105) arranged to impart to the faces of each individual

pair of faces rotational movement of mutually
different speeds, 
characterized
 in that a
stack of mutually spaced discs (143, 144; 343, 344) is

arranged in the interior of the container (101), the
faces of said discs forming several pairs of oppositely

arranged faces, at least several of adjacent discs in
said stack being rotatable, in that it comprises means

for driving several of the discs (143; 343) at a higher
rotational speed than adjacent discs (144; 344), and in

that the inlet (113) for supply of liquid to be cleaned
and the outlet (114) for discharge of cleaned liquid are

positioned at the stack periphery and in that the
outlets (110, 111) for discharge of the separated

particles are positioned centrally, i.e. close to the
centre of rotation.
A device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that the discs (143; 343) rotating at a 
higher speed are forcibly driven while the discs (144;

344) rotating at a lower speed are arranged for free
rotation and have braking means (161, 162, 153; 360)

travelling in the liquid and providing the suitable speed
difference.
A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that the means (105) for driving
some of the discs (143; 343) is formed by a perforated

tubular element (145, 146, 147, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153;

346, 350) having an open communication radially between
the tube interior and the inter-disc spaces.
A device as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized

in that the outlets (110, 111) for
separated particles are provided at least at one of the

ends of the tubular element (145, 146, 147, 149, 150,
151, 152, 153; 346, 350).
