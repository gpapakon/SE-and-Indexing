<ABSTRACT>
In a conveyor link chain (K) with at least one driver (M) connected to the link chain (K) by means of an adaptor (A) in a force-transmitting and movement-transmitting manner, there is located between the driver (M) and the link chain (K) a vibration-damping device (D) with at least one damping member (G) which is under pretension and which is made from elastic and shock-absorbing material. In a conveying device with at least one conveyor link chain (K), a vibration-damping device (D) with at least one pretensioned damping member (G) is provided between the driver (M) and the link chain (K).

<CLAIMS>
Conveyor link chain (K) having at least one carrier (M) 
which is connected to the link chain (K) in a manner 

transmitting force and movement by means of an adapter (A), 
characterised in that between the carrier (M) and the link 

chain (K) a vibration damping device (D) having at least one 
damping member (G) under initial tension made of rubber or 

elastomer is provided and that each damping member (G) is an 
elastic section of tubing or an annular or cylindrical 

elastic moulded part. 
Conveyor link chain according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the damping member (G) is provided between the 

adapter (A) and the link chain (K). 
Conveyor link chain according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the damping member (G) is provided between the 

carrier (M) and the adapter (A). 
Conveyor link chain according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the link chain (K) is a hollow bolt 

link chain, that the adapter (A) has an adapter pin (9) which 
is plugged in at most with a sliding fit into a hollow bolt 

(3) and that between the adapter pin (9) and the inner wall 
(18) of the hollow bolt (3) the at least single damping 

member (G), preferably two axially spaced damping members 
(G), is or are provided with radial initial tension. 
Conveyor link chain according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the adapter pin (9) has two axially spaced 

circumferential grooves (14) and that in each of the 
circumferential grooves (14) an annular damping member (G) is 

arranged.  
 
Conveyor link chain according to Claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that every circumferential groove (14) is 

axially spaced from the neighbouring end of the hollow bolt 
(3), that adjacent to every circumferential groove (14) and 

between the circumferential grooves (14) each adapter pin (9) 
has a collar (16, 15, 17), the outer diameter of which is 

undersized relative to the inner diameter of the hollow bolt 
(3) to an extent defining at most a sliding fit, and that at 

least the collar (16) facing towards the carrier (M), 
preferably also the collar (15) located at the opposite end 

of the hollow bolt, engages at least partially in the hollow 
bolt (3). 
Conveyor link chain according to Claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that the adapter pin (9) is an elongated end 

of the carrier (M) which is fastened with a shaft (6) in an 
adapter shackle (12) capable of being secured in position on 

the hollow bolt link chain, preferably pressed into the 
latter. 
Conveyor link chain according to Claims 1 and 3, 
characterised in that the link chain (K) is a hollow bolt 

link chain, that the adapter (A) capable of being secured in 
position on the hollow bolt link chain has an adapter 

mounting (20) with a receptacle (21) for a retaining part 
(22) of the carrier shaft (6), that the retaining part (22) 

is plugged into the receptacle (19) at most with a sliding 
fit, and that the at least single initially tensioned damping 

member (G) is arranged between the retaining part (22) and 
the inner wall of the receptacle (19). 
Conveyor link chain according to at least one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterised in that the damping member (G) consists 

of rubber or elastomer resistant to temperatures of up to 
about 300Â°C, alkali solutions, acids and gases.  

 
Conveyor link chain according to at least one of Claims 
4 to 9, characterised in that the damping member (G) is of 

such a size that it can be set under radial initial tension 
by plugging it into the hollow bolt (3) or into the 

receptacle (19). 
Conveyor device (F) having at least one conveyor link 
chain (K) according to Claim 1 capable of being driven in a 

longitudinal or curved movement. 
Conveyor device according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the at least single carrier (M) is provided between two 

spaced conveyor link chains (F) guided essentially parallel 
to one another and is connected in a manner transmitting 

movement to each conveyor link chain (F) by means of the 
adapter, and that the vibration damping device (D) is 

provided between the carrier (M) and each conveyor link chain 
(F).
