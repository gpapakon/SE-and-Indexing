<ABSTRACT>
A rigid assembly of at least two intersecting constituent 
members (1,3) which form between them at least one engagement canal 

made of 
two opposite holes in two brackets (4,5) of one constituent member (3), 

each with an 
inwardly converging wall, and a registering transversal bore (9,10) 

with divergent 
end portions in the other constituent member. A tightening device is 

accommodated within each engagement canal which comprises a first 
cylindrical member (15) with a centrally bored frusto-conical head 

portion (16), a 
second cylindrical member (18) slidably accommodated therein and having a 

screw-threaded central bore (20) and a frusto-conical head portion (19), 
and a 

tightening screw (21) connecting both cylindrical members, each of said 
frusto-conical 

head portions being of smaller size than the associated bracket hole 
and having a slant matching that of the side wall of the latter. When the 

tightening screw (21) is tightened, the first and second cylindrical 
members of the 

tightening device are drawn together and the constituent members are 
fastened to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an assembly comprising two 
constituent members rigidly locked together in such a way that the planes 
of contact between the two members intersect. For convenience such an 
assembly will be referred to hereinafter as "intersecting rigid assembly". Intersecting rigid assemblies are required for the transmission 
of forces from one constituent member to the other, typical examples being 
a turbine in which a plurality of blades are mounted on a rotor; missiles or 
rockets in which guiding fins or rudders are mounted on a tail portion; and 
there are many others. In accordance with the priot art, the interlocking 
engagement of two constituent members of an intersecting rigid assembly 
is brought about by providing on the first constituent member an engagement 
portion with a plurality of transversal bores, providing on the second 
constituent member an integral pair of brackets with a plurality of pairs of 
registering holes, inserting the engagement portion of the first constituent  
 
member between a pair of brackets of the second constituent member so that 
each bore of the former is in alignment with a pair of registering holes of 
the latter, and tightening the two constituent members together by means of 
tightening members such as screws, bolts or rivets. In such prior art 
intersecting rigid assemblies, the tightening forces holding the two 
constituent members together are oriented predominantly in the direction of 
the tightening members. Accordingly, in order to provide the necessary 
resistance to the forces acting on the assembly, a relatively large number of 
tightening members is required which renders the assembling operation quite 
onerous. It is noted that tightening means are known from FR-A-2621362 in which two members with frusto-conical heads are located in spaced relationship in use and are drawn towards each other by a screw. It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved 
intersecting rigid assembly of the kind specified and also to provide 
tightening means for use in such an assembly. The invention is based on a novel concept for making an 
intersecting rigid assembly of the kind specified, by which mutually normal 
tightening forces are provided for holding the first and second constituent 
members together, and it has been found in accordance with the invention 
that in this way it is possible to achieve a superior interlock in terms of 
resistance to external forces, with less tightening members. In accordance with the

<CLAIMS>
An intersecting rigid assembly of at least one first 
consituent member (1) and one second constituent member (3) of the kind 

in which a flat engagement portion of said at least first 
constituent member having at least one transverse bore is held 

between two brackets (4,5) of said second constituent member, which 
brackets are of a selected height, define between them a bracket 

base and have at least one pair of alignet bracket holes (9,10) in 
register with the transverse bore of the flat engagement portion 

to form a tightening canal that accomodates a tightening device, 
characterised in that: 


(i) said flat engagement portion has a lower edge matching 
said bracket base and two shoulders spaced from said 

lower edge by a distance corresponding to the height 
of said brackets; 
(ii) each bracket hole has a slanted, inwardly convergent 
peripheral wall and each transverse bore has divergent 

end portions; 
(iii) the tightening device in accommodated within said 
tightening canal and comprises a first cylindrical 

member (15) which is axially bored therethrough and has a 
frusto-conical head portion, a second cylindrical 

member (18) slidably accommodated in the bore of the first 
cylindrical member and has a screw-threaded axial bore 

and a frusto-conical head portion, and a tightening 
screw (21) connecting both cylindrical members by passing through the bore in the first cylindrical member and engaging with the threaded bore, each of 

said frustro-conical head portions being of smaller 
size than the associated bracket hole and having a 

slant matching that of the side wall of the latter; 
 
whereby when the tightening screw is tightened the said first and 

second cylindrical members are drawn together causing their 
respective frustro-conical heads to engage the respective bracket 

holes and thereby urge the shoulders and lower edge of the flat 
engagement portion of said at least one first constituent member  

 
to come to bear firmly against, respectively, the upper edges of 

the brackets and the bracket base of the second constituent 
member. 
An intersecting rigid assembly according to claim 1, 
comprising one single tightening canal accomodating a tightening 

device. 
An intersecting rigid assembly according to claim 1, 
comprising at least two tightening canals each accommodating a 

tightening device. 
A tightening device comprising a first cylindrical member (15) 
which is axially bored therethrough and has a frustro-conical head 

portion, a second cylindrical member (18) which is slidably located 

in the bore of the first cylindrical member has and has a frustro-conical 
head portion and a central screw-threaded bore, and a 

tightening screw (21) which passes through the bore in the first 
cylindrical member and is in engagement with the threaded bore 

for connecting and drawing the two members together. 
A tightening device for use in an intersecting rigid 
assembly according to any one of claims 1-3, comprising a first 

cylindrical member which is axially bored therethrough and has 
a frusto-conical head portion, a second cylindrical member which 

is slidably located in the bore of the first cylindrical member 
and has a frusto-conical head portion and a central screw-threaded 

bore, and a tightening screw which passes through the 
bore in the first cylindrical member and is in engagement with 

the threaded bore for connecting and drawing the two members 
together.
