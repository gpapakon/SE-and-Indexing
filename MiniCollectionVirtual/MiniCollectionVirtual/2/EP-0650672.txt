<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for extending human hair by attaching a hairpiece to natural hair by means of an adhesive which becomes liquefied when hot. For holding the hairpiece to be attached and the hair to be extended by means of elements (2, 3) of the device, provided with pressing-on surfaces (2.1, 3.1), and for bringing them into contact with the liquefied adhesive, the pressing-on surfaces (2.1, 3.1) of the device are held so that they can be moved towards one another perpendicularly to the plane of the surfaces, at least one of the pressing-on surfaces being provided with a heating device, and the pressing-on surfaces (2.1, 3.1) being held by means of bar elements which extend in the longitudinal direction and are connected to one another at their ends opposite the pressing-on surfaces by means of a rotary bearing (4) or an elastic connection in such a way that the pressing-on surfaces can be moved towards one another or away from one another by manual pressure on the elements extending in the longitudinal direction.

<CLAIMS>
A device for lengthening human hair by addition of a
length of hair to natural hair by means of an adhesive

which is fluid when hot,

having rod elements (2, 3; 2', 3') which have pressing
surfaces (6; 2.1, 3.1; 2.1', 3.1') and grips (2.2, 3.2)

for holding the hair piece which is to be attached and
the hair to be lengthened and for bringing it into

contact with the liquefied adhesive, which are guided
towards each other in a vertical direction on the plane

of extension of the pressing surfaces, and of which at
least one has a means of heating,
wherein the rod elements (2, 3) are connected via a
common pivoting axis (4) in the form of a pair of pliers

or scissors, a spring element (5) being disposed between
the grips, or
wherein the rod elements (2', 3') are elastically
connected like a pair of tweezers at a point (11) on the

ends facing away from the pressing surfaces, and having
a degree of elasticity at least at these ends,
in such a way that the pressing surfaces can be moved
towards one another by manual force applied to the

grips, separating again when the pressure on the grips
is released.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that
an electrical means of heating is provided.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the pressing surfaces (6; 2.1, 3.1; 2.1', 3.1') are

disposed in such a way that they lie closely on top of
one another at the end of the swinging movement of the 

rod elements (2, 3; 2', 3').
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the scissor or pliers-shaped connected rod elements

consist of a substantially linear first part (2), from a
grip (2.2) to a heatable element (2.1) and a non-heated

second part (3)pivoting in the middle region opposite
the first part, wherein the second part has two parts

which extend in a substantially straight line parallel
to the first part which are connected by a bridge

crossing the first part (2) in the region of the
pivoting axis (4).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the spring element between the

grips of the parts which are connected like pliers or
scissors is a compression spring (5).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that in each case, a recess (8),

especially groove-like, is provided within the pressing
surfaces (6).
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a storage container (9) is

provided for the adhesive on one of the rod elements
(3), which has an outlet opening or channel (10) facing

the pressing surface (3.1).
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that
the outlet channel (10) ends in the recess (8) on the

pressing surface (3.1). 
A device according to claim 8, characterised in that
the release of adhesive is controlled by the swinging

movement of the rod elements (2, 3; 2', 3').
A device according to claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that a separate heatable container is provided as a

storage container for the adhesive.
A device according to one of claims 2 to 10,
characterised in that the means of heating comprises a

heating element of a similar type to that used in a
soldering iron.
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a controller with a temperature

sensor in the area of the pressing surfaces is provided
to maintain a specified temperature at the pressing

surfaces (6; 2.1, 3.1; 2.1', 3.1') or the heatable

container (9).
