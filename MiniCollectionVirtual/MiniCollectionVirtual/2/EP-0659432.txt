<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to sugar-coated dosage units 
comprising a steroid having two hydrogen atoms at 

position 3 of the steroid skeleton, such as desogestrel, 
allylestrenol, ethylestrenol, or lynestrenol, to a 

process for the manufacture of such dosage units, and a 
use of sugar-coated compositions for providing stable 

dosage units comprising said steroid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sugar-coated dosage units 
comprising a steroid having two hydrogen atoms at 
position 3 of the steroid skeleton, such as desogestrel, 
allylestrenol, ethylestrenol, or lynestrenol, to a 
process for the manufacture of such dosage units, and a 
use of sugar-coated compositions for providing stable 
dosage units comprising said steroid. Sugar-coating of compressed tablet cores and granules is 
one of the oldest processes known in the art. It is used 
to mask unpleasant tastes and odours, to protect an 
ingredient from decomposition as a result of exposure to 
air, light, or moisture, or to improve tablet appearance 
and increase esthetic appeal. It has now been found that sugar-coating can be used for 
the solution of another problem. It was experienced that 
apolar active compounds, such as steroids having two 
hydrogen atoms at position 3 of the steroid skeleton, 
show a tendency to transfer out of tablets and granules 
comprising said apolar active compounds. This is of 
particular concern when the tablet cores or granules 
comprise very low dosages of said apolar active 
compounds. This is the case in tablets and granules 
comprising the progestagen desogestrel, allylestrenol, 
ethylestrenol, or lynestrenol. Tablets having desogestrel 
as active ingredient comprise usually 25-150 µg, 
and typically 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 µg of desogestrel. 
Tablets having allylestrenol as active ingredient 
comprise usually 10-75 mg, and typically 25 mg of 
allylestrenol, and tablets having ethylestrenol or 
lynestrenol as active ingredient comprise usually 0.5-10 
mg, and typically 2.0 or 2.5 mg of ethylestrenol or 
lynestrenol. For desogestrel, allylestrenol, ethylestrenol,  
 
or lynestrenol, which are used as active 
ingredient in contraceptive or HRT (hormone replacement 
therapy) drugs, this is not acceptable in view of their 
safety and reliability. A loss of for example 10% of the 
active substance within the shelf-life has therefore a 
dramatic effect on the amount of active ingredient in 
the tablet, and could lead to a tablet having less than 
the treshold amount of active ingredient to exert full 
activity. It is now found that sugar-coating can be used 
for other purposes than preventing moisture to enter the 
tablet or granule; it also can be used to prevent the 
transfer of a steroid having two hydrogen atoms at 
position 3 of the steroid skeleton, such as desogestrel, 
allylestrenol, ethylestrenol, or lynestrenol from the 
tablet or granule to the environment. The

<CLAIMS>
A sugar-coated dosage unit characterized in that the 
dosage unit contains a composition comprising a 

steroid having two hydrogen atoms at position 3 of 
the steroid skeleton. 
The sugar-coated dosage unit of claim 1 wherein the 
dosage unit contains a composition comprising 

desogestrel, allylestrenol, ethylestrenol, or 
lynestrenol. 
The sugar-coated dosage unit of claim 2, wherein the 
composition comprises desogestrel. 
The sugar-coated dosage unit of any one of claims 
1-3, wherein the composition further comprises an 

estrogen. 
The sugar-coated dosage unit of claim 4, wherein the 
estrogen is ethinyl estradiol or β-estradiol. 
The sugar-coated dosage unit of any one of claims 1-5, 
wherein the dosage unit is a tablet core or 

granule. 
A use of a sugar-coating for the manufacture of a 
sugar-coated tablet core or granule comprising a 

steroid having two hydrogen atoms at position 3 of 
the steroid skeleton, preferably being desogestrel, 

allylestrenol, ethylestrenol, or lynestrenol, for 
preventing the steroid to transfer from the tablet 

core or the granule into the environment.
