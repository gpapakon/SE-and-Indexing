<ABSTRACT>
A conductive paste compound for via hole filling includes 
a conductive filler at 80 to 92 weight percent with an average 

particle size of from 0.5 to 20µm and specific surface of from 
0.1 to 1.5 m²/g, a liquid epoxy resin at 4.5 to 20 weight percent 

containing 2 or more epoxy groups with room temperature viscosity 
of 15 Pa·sec or less, and a hardener at 0.5 to 5 weight percent, 

wherein the viscosity is 2,000 Pa·sec or less and the volatile 
amount is 2.0 weight percent or less. A filling paste and a 

printed circuit board with use thereof are provided which can 
conduct an inner-via-hole connection between electrode layers 

without using a through-hole plating technique. 
The conductive paste comprises a metallic particle 103 
such as copper, an epoxy resin, a hardener, and if necessary, a 

dispersant. The paste having low viscosity and low volatility 
under high shear is used to fill holes disposed in a laminated 

substrate 101. Then, this substrate is heated and pressurized 
together with copper foil 102 on both sides to attain a printed 

circuit board where both sides are electrically inner-via-hole 
connected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a conductive paste compound
used for filling via holes and further relates to a double sided
printed circuit board and a multilayer printed circuit board
which uses the conductive paste.Recently, following the tendency of electronic devices
towards high performance and compact size, a circuit board is
required to have a high degree of lamination and high density.
As a method of connecting layers within a substrate which can
bond integrated circuits (IC) and components at the shortest
distance, it is well-known that higher density can be attained
through an inner-via-hole connection. In the case of a through-hole
connection employed for a typical glass epoxy multilayer
substrate, the connection is achieved by plating through-holes so
that it was difficult to connect only the necessary layers. In
addition, since the substrate comprises a top layer having an
electrode land, this part can not be used to construct an
electrode land of a surface mounting part. Therefore, due to
these restrictions, the mounting density can not be easily
enhanced.In order to solve these problems, methods other than 
using through-holes are employed, for example, a method of
reducing through-holes by disposing holes halfway in a substrate,
or a method of improving mounting density by filling conductive
paste in through-holes and by further closing up holes disposed
in the top layer of a substrate at a plating step. However, due
to the complicated manufacturing processes, the above-mentioned
methods have cost and quantity production problems. On the other
hand, simply the necessary layers can be connected in the inner-via-hole
connection, and since there is no through-holes in the
top layer of the substrate, the mounting property is also
excellent.When this connecting method is applied to a resin
substrate, e.g. to a glass epoxy substrate, a double sided
substrate establishes a connection by filling up through-holes with
low-viscous solvent-type silver paste by means of a printing
method and subsequent drying and hardening. However, the specific
resistance value of this connection is as high as about 10-3Ω •
cm, and the reliability in heat and shock resistance such as in
the heat cycle is poor.In order to reduce the viscosity of the conductive paste,
conventional methods employed were to use large particles in order to
reduce the amount of conductive filler or the specific surface
area, or to add a solvent with a low boiling point or a reactant
type diluent. However, when an additive amount of conductive
