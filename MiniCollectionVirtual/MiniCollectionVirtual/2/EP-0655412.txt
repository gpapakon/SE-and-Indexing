<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for connecting a precast concrete part consists of a locating part (1) which has a locating opening (11). Adjoining the locating opening (11) are holding parts (12) which, during a pivoting movement of the arrangement, engage under the supporting head (53), laterally projecting beyond the shank (51), of the anchor bolt (52) concreted in a precast concrete part (5). A rope loop is provided for connecting the locating part (1) to a load-supporting means of a lifting device, the ends (21, 22) of the rope loop projecting into an elongated recess (41) of the locating part (1).
