<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for platemaking a stencil 
printing sheet so that there may be no need of preliminarily 

preparing for manuscripts at a time of platemaking, the 
consumables, such as a lamp and others, may not be consumed, 

the stencil sheet can hardly crumple, there may be no sheet 
loss, and a brilliant printed matter may be obtained. The 

platemaking process according to the present invention is 
characterized by perforating a stencil sheet having a 

solvent-soluble resin layer by using the solvent, and 
feeding the solvent, at a time of platemaking, to the 

surface of the solvent-soluble resin layer by a solvent feed 
means selectively and in a non-contact condition thereof, 

resulting in the solvent-soluble resin layer brought in 
contact with the solvent is dissolved and perforated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platemaking process
for a stencil printing sheet. Specifically, the present
invention relates to a platemaking process for a stencil
printing sheet which can perforate the stencil printing
sheet without bringing the stencil printing sheet into
contact with a platemaking machine.In the prior art, as a platemaking process for a
stencil printing sheet, the following methods are known: (1)
a process of writing letters or drawing pictures with a
steel or ball pen on a stencil printing sheet prepared by
impregnating a porous paper with a wax, to remove the wax
portion corresponding to the letters or pictures; and (2) a
process of melt-perforating the thermoplastic resin film of
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet consisting of a thermoplastic
resin film and a porous substrate by means of the heat from
a flash lamp, infrared lamp or thermal head.However, according to the first method (1), platemaking
depends upon manual operation and the resulting platemaking
efficiency is thus low. Therefore, large numbers of plates
could not be prepared.On the other hand, as the second method (2), there are
exemplified processes of superimposing a hand written or
preliminarily prepared manuscript on a heat-sensitive
stencil sheet and then melt-perforating the thermoplastic 
resin film of the heat-sensitive stencil sheet by means of
the heat generated from, for example, a flash lamp or an
infrared lamp, and a process of bringing a thermal head
which generates dot-like heat zones, in accordance with
electrical signals from letter or picture information, into
contact with a heat-sensitive stencil sheet, and melt-perforating
the thermoplastic resin film of the heat-sensitive
stencil sheet.However, both these processes exhibit disadvantages.The former process has the disadvantages that a new
manuscript has to be used after every platemaking step, the
operational property is inferior and the power consumption
by the lamp is large.The latter process has the disadvantages that since the
molten material of the thermoplastic resin film is left in
the porous substrate, ink permeability is prevented,
resulting in the inability to obtain brilliant printed
matter, although replacement of manuscripts and lamps is
reduced and fewer consumables are used. Furthermore, in
such a process, as it is necessary to let the heat-sensitive
stencil sheet sufficiently contact a thermal head under a
high pressure at the time of platemaking, it has the
disadvantage that a thin heat-sensitive stencil sheet
crumples easily,
