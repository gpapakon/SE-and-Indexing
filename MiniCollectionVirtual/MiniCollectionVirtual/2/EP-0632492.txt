<ABSTRACT>
A prior art thin film transistor structure having a first and a second polycrystalline 
silicon layer of different conductivity types (P and N) has a high resistance contact at the 

resultant P-N junction. This contact resistance is reduced by forming TiSi
2
 (titanium 
disilicide) or other refractory metal silicides such as cobalt or molybdenum in specific 

regions, namely the P-N junction contact. Titanium disilicide consumes the portion of the 
second polycrystalline silicon layer in the P-N contact junction and at the same time 

consumes a small portion of the underlying first polycrystalline silicon layer, such that the 
high resistance P-N junction now no longer exists. 
The procedure to form low resistance contacts is extended to achieve a low 

leakage polysilicon TFT device. One or more LDD regions are formed to reduce the 
amount of leakage current of such transistor devices in an "OFF" state. The source/drain 

region(s) of the device are implanted with a first dopant type followed by an etch which 
forms spacers above the source/drain regions. Then, the source/drain regions are 

implanted with a second dopant type so that LDD regions are formed beneath the 
spacers. The electric field at the gate and source/drain boundaries of the device is 

spread over the entire LDD region, resulting in a lower peak electric field and hence less 
device leakage current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor 
integrated circuit processing, and more specifically to a thin 
film transistor (TFT) structure having low contact resistance at 
the P-N junction or diode where contact or interconnect between 
at least two regions having different conductivity type occurs 
and to such a structure further having self-aligned lightly doped 
drain (LDD) structures. This application is related to European Patent Application 
No 94303007.2, the contents of which are incorporated herein by 
this cross reference. PN diode interconnection technology, such as thin-film transistor (TFT) or 
polycrystalline silicon technology, is used in SRAM and video display technology because 
of the high density advantage it provides. In thin-film transistor technology, P-channel 
polycrystalline silicon transistors are generally used as the PMOS load with the NMOS 
drivers and passgates built in the single crystal substrate. The use of P-channel 
polysilicon transistors as the load for the SRAM cell usually results in better electrical 
characteristics than polysilicon resistors, and they are typically faster than resistive loads. 
Additionally, P-channel transistors provide greater immunity to noise.  In spite of the benefits associated with the use of polycrystalline silicon P-channel 
transistors as load transistors, a disadvantage arises when interconnection between 
polycrystalline silicon lines having different conductivity types occurs, causing high 
resistance contacts to be formed. TFT technology of three polycrystalline silicon layers 
of different conductivity types will result in polycrystalline silicon interconnect lines of 
different conductivity making contact. For instance, interconnection between a P+ 
polycrystalline silicon layer and an adjacent N+ polycrystalline silicon layer results in a 
high resistance contact being formed at the resultant P-N junction. In a three layer 
polycrystalline silicon transistor, with the second and third layers composed of N+ and P+ 
materials, respectively, a high resistance contact is formed at the P-N junction between 
the second and third polycrystalline silicon layers. Yet another problem often encountered in polysilicon TFT technology is leakage 
current. At the boundary between the gate and drain regions of a transistor, there can 
be a large electric field present when the transistor is in an "OFF" state. This, combined 
with electron trapping at grain boundaries in the substrate, will often result in a high level 
of
