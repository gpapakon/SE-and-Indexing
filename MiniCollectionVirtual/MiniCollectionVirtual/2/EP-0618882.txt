<ABSTRACT>
In the Bayer process for producing alumina from bauxite, the efficiency of the red mud separation procedure can be substantially improved if the flocculant (45) normally used is diluted with a clear process liquor (43c) obtained from a prior, the same or a subsequent settling or washing step and mixing this diluted flocculant solution with the red mud slurry (41) to be separated. This permits the use of less flocculant than conventional methods, the avoidance of diluting with water and the production of a thickened slurry of increased mud concentration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
alumina from bauxite and, more particularly, to a Bayer 
process with an improved red mud separation stage. In the Bayer process for producing alumina from 
bauxite, the bauxite containing aluminum trihydroxides or 
aluminum oxide-hydroxides is contacted with solutions 
containing caustic soda to dissolve the aluminum 
hydroxides as sodium aluminate while leaving most of the 
remaining constituents of the bauxite essentially 
unattacked in solid form. A part or all of the silica 
content of the bauxite may also dissolve in the caustic 
soda solution to form a soluble sodium silicate. This 
reacts relatively slowly with the sodium aluminate in 
solution to form complex hydrated sodium aluminum 
silicates, known collectively as "desilication product". 
These desilication products are of low solubility in the 
resulting sodium aluminate-caustic soda solutions and 
largely precipitate out of solution thereby removing much 
of the undesirable silica from the solution phase. 
However, there is the substantial cost of an appreciable 
loss of chemically-bound caustic soda and alumina in the 
desilication product. After the digestion step for dissolving the aluminum 
hydroxide from the bauxite, the undissolved part of the 
bauxite, together with any desilication product that has 
precipitated at this point, which are known as "red mud", 
are separated from the solution, usually by filtration or 
sedimentation or both. The red mud is then disposed of, 
usually after being washed to recover the soluble 
valuables and the entrained caustic-aluminate solution. 
The clear caustic-aluminate solution after precipitation 
of the red mud, commonly known as "pregnant liquor", is  
 
subsequently cooled, diluted, seeded with aluminum 
trihydroxide crystals (gibbsite) and agitated for a period 
of time to precipitate a significant fraction of the 
dissolved alumina as gibbsite. This precipitate is then 
separated from the resulting spent liquor, which typically 
still contains in the order of half of the original 
dissolved alumina. A part of the separated gibbsite may 
be recirculated as seed material to the aluminum 
precipitation operation, while the remainder is washed to 
recover the soluble valuables from the entrained liquor, 
and is then suitably calcined to form alumina product of 
the Bayer process. The spent liquor may be re-concentrated, 
impurities may be removed and new caustic 
soda may be added to make up the feed to the digestion 
step. The solubility

<CLAIMS>
A Bayer process for producing alumina from 
bauxite which comprises digesting bauxite slurry in 

caustic soda solution to dissolve aluminum hydroxides in 
the bauxite as sodium aluminate while leaving most of the 

remaining constituents of the bauxite in solid form as red 
mud, separating the red mud from the digested slurry by 

settling in the presence of a synthetic polymer flocculant 
based on acrylamide and/or sodium acrylate to obtain a 

caustic-aluminate pregnant liquor, washing the separated 
red mud, precipitating alumina hydrate from the pregnant 

liquor and calcining the alumina hydrate to obtain the 
alumina,

diluted to a concentration of less than 1000 ppm for a 
separation under elevated pressure or diluted to a 

concentration of less than 100 ppm for a separation under 
normal pressure with a clear process liquor obtained from 

a prior, the same or a subsequent settling or washing step 
and mixing this diluted flocculant solution with the red 

mud slurry to be separated. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the synthetic flocculant and the clear process 

liquor are mixed with a residence time sufficient to 
provide complete mixing prior to being added to the 

digester slurry. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the synthetic flocculant and the clear process 

liquor travel a distance of at least 0.5 meter through a 
feed pipe to provide contact time. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the clear process liquor is obtained 

from an earlier or a subsequent settling or washing step. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized by diluting a major portion of the synthetic 

flocculant in a portion of the clear overflow liquid from 
a subsequent settling step, combining this diluted 

flocculant with a solids rich underflow from a prior  

 
settling step, along with a minor portion of clear 

overflow liquid from the instant washing settling stage 
and transferring this mixture with further mixing during 

transfer, to the instant washing/settling step where it is 
combined with a minor portion of the synthetic flocculant 

solution, and then introducing the combined mixture into 
the washing/settling vessel.

in that the diluted flocculant solution contains 1-50 ppm

flocculant. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the diluted flocculant solution contains
