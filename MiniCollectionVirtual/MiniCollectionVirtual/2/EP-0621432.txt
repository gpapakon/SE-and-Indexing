<ABSTRACT>
The device includes two rigid tubular elements (3, 4) which are placed coaxially outside and inside the hose (1). The hose (1) is clamped between the tubular elements (3, 4). The outer tubular element (3) includes slits (9) passing through its wall over some of its periphery. A clip (6) having two legs (6a, 6b) is fitted onto the outer tubular element (3) after the tubular elements (3, 4) have been clamped onto the hose (1), so that the legs (6a, 6b) of the clip (6) include an inwardly projecting part of the outer tubular element (3). The assembly constituted by the hose (1), the tubular elements (3, 4) and the clip (6) is engaged over the rigid pipe end (2) after the clip (6) has been clamped and fitted. The clip (6) holds the joining device. The invention applies in particular to connecting a radiator hose to the radiator of a motor vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
Sealed connection device for a hose (1) 
and a rigid tubular end (2), especially for a 

cooling circuit of a motor vehicle, comprising two 
rigid tubular elements (3, 4) arranged coaxially, 

respectively inside and outside a joining end of 
that hose and respectively called the external 

rung (3) and the internal ring (4), a toric seal 
(5) interposed between one of the tubular elements 

(4) and the rigid end (2), and means for holding 
at least one of the tubular elements (3) with 

respect to the rigid end (2) comprising a clip (6) 
having arms (6a, 6b) which can move apart from one 

another resiliently, and at least one portion (2b) 
which projects radially towards the outside of the 

rigid end (2) and which is co-operable with the 
arms (6a, 6b) of the clip (6), characterised in 

that: 

the external ring (3) and the internal 
ring (4) produced from metal are squeezed onto the 

joining end of the hose (1); 
the external ring (3) comprises at 
least one slot (9) which extends through its wall 

over a portion of its periphery; and 
the clip (6) is mounted on the external 
ring (3) in such a manner that its rectilinear 

arms (6a, 6b) which are folded towards one  
 

another in the unconstrained state, and which are 
introduced into the slot (9) extending through the 

wall of the external ring (3), project partially 
inside the external ring (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the external ring (3) 

comprises at least two lugs (10) which project 
radially towards the inside and in that the 

internal ring (4) comprises an annular portion 
(4b) which projects radially towards the outside 

and which is to abut the lugs (10) of the external 
ring (3), when it is positioned inside the hose 

(1) which is engaged in the external ring (3) in 
such a manner that its joining end abuts the lugs 

(10) opposite the annular portion (4b) of the 
internal ring (4). 
Device according to either Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterised in that the internal ring 

(4) comprises an internal groove (4c) which houses 
a toric seal (5) which is to come into sealing 

contact with the rigid end (2). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the external ring (3) 

comprises a flared end (3a) by way of which the 
hose (1) locates, and in that the internal ring  

 
(4) comprises at least two ribs (11) projecting 

towards the outside, in such a manner as to 
facilitate the mounting and squeezing of the 

external ring (3) and the internal ring (4) on the 
joining end of the hose (1). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the internal ring (4) 

comprises a lug (12) formed by pressing towards 
the inside an area of the wall of the internal 

ring (4) and in that the rigid end (2) comprises 
an external rib (8) that is co-operable with the 

projecting portion (12) of the internal ring (4) 
in order to orientate the hose (1) with respect to 

the rigid end (2) during the positioning of the 
connection device. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the arms (6a, 6b) of 

the clip (6) are folded towards one another in the 
unconstrained state in such a manner as to form a 

non-zero angle of between 0 and approximately 30° 
between them. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the wall of the 

external ring (3) is traversed by two slots (9) 
arranged according to two arcs of a cross-section  

 
of the ring (3) having a size of approximately 

120°. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, character
ised in that the external ring (3) 
comprises an external groove (3c) delimited at one 

end of the external ring (3) by a flange (3b), 
inside which the slot (9) is machined and on which 

a portion of the clip (6) connecting the arms 
(6a, 6b) of the clip (6) is supported.
