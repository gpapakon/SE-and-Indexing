<ABSTRACT>
A rotary blade (10,19) includes a fixed boundary layer control device 
(15,25,37) extending spanwise on 

a lower surface (14,23) adjacent the trailing edge (12,21) to improve the 
lift/thrust characteristics 

of the blade especially at positive incidence angles. It was discovered 
that expected 

detrimental effects at zero/negative incidence did not materialise and 
the reasons are 

identified. Such blades are particularly useful for helicopter 
sustaining and anti-torque rotors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary blades and is particularly concerned with blades
which are rotated by a power source to generate lift and/or propulsion.In the following text, many references are made to upper and lower surfaces of an
aerofoil profile of a rotary blade. For the purpose of defining these terms the
aerofoil profile is considered to be that of a wing generating lift when at positive
incidence. In flowing over the upper surface air decreases in pressure and the upper
surface is thus also referred to as the suction surface, and in flowing over the lower
surface air increases in pressure and the lower surface is thus also referred to as the
pressure surface.One application of powered rotary blades is in helicopters where such blades are
used both in main sustaining rotors which rotate in a generally horizontal plane
about a vertical axis and in anti-torque tail rotors which rotate in a generally vertical
plane about a horizontal axis.The flight envelope of any helicopter is bounded according to the fundamental
aerodynamic limits of the aerofoil profiles used in its rotary blades.In the case of a sustaining rotor it is necessary to balance the lift (or thrust)
produced by its rotary blades in the advancing and retreating sectors of its
operational rotor disc. This dictates that a rotary blade must perform well both at
low Mach number and high angle of attack (incidence) as the retreating blade, and
at high Mach number and low or negative incidence as the advancing blade. The
same aerofoil profile must therefore have both a high stalling angle (for the
retreating blade) and a high limiting Mach number; for a rotary blade without
advanced tip planform geometry such as disclosed in GB-A-1538055 which can to
some extent uncouple the problem, its performance is determined by its aerofoil
profile. For rotary blades with such advanced tip planforms which allow some penetration
of the aerofoil profile separation boundary on the retreating blade, the aerofoil
profile remains close to separation and drag rise around the rear of the rotor disc.
Because dynamic head is high in this region, drag-rise and stall cannot be tolerated
so that the aerofoil profiles of such blades must also possess high performance at mid
Mach number.In the case of rotary blades for an anti-torque tail rotor, the extreme high and low
Mach number performance requirements are more relaxed although high
performance at mid Mach number is of paramount importance, requiring a different
aerofoil profile aerodynamic solution.In striving
