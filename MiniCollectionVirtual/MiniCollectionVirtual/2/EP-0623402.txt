<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an extrusion process for extruding a metal billet (6) placed in a container (3) delimiting a housing (4) for the billet (6), the housing being closed at one end by a back piece (plate) (13) and at the other end by a dummy block (bearing plate) (5), in which process, before carrying out the extrusion, the billet (6) is precompressed in order to press the latter against the internal face (43) of the housing (4). In accordance with the invention, at the start of the precompression phase, a small clearance (e) is maintained between the closure back piece (13) and the corresponding end (31) of the container (3), preventing the container (3) from moving closer to the back piece (13) during the precompression in order to allow removal, via the clearance (e) thus maintained, of the air contained between the billet (6) and the internal face (43) of the housing (4), during the expansion of the billet (6) and the said clearance (e) is then left to close up by advancing the container (3) thus rendered integral with the billet (6). The invention applies more especially to direct extrusion, but may also be of interest in the case of reverse extrusion.

Process for extruding a metal billet in an extrusion press comprising a first 
fixed crosspiece (1) and a second fixed crosspiece (11) separated by a constant 

distance, a container (3) having a tubular housing (4) centered on an extrusion axis 
(10) and in which the billet (6) is placed, said container (3) bearing, during extrusion, 

on the first crosspiece (1), two pieces (13,5) for closing the two ends of the housing 
(4), respectively, a first piece (13) carried by said first fixed crosspiece (1) and a 

second piece (5) having a section substantially equal to those of the housing (4) 
provided at the end of an elongated rammer bearing on the second fixed cross-piece 

(11) and liable to enter by axial sliding inside the housing (4), a die centered on the 
extrusion axis (10) and which is mounted on one of said closing pieces (13,5) and 

control means (51,52) to move closer said closing pieces (13,5) one to another and 
which bear against one of said fixed crosspieces (1,11) for extruding the billet (6) in 

the die (14), the extrusion operation being preceded by a phase for precompressing the 
billet (6) between the two closing pieces (13,5) until application of the side wall (61) 

thereof against the internal face (43) of the housing (4),
 
characterized in that at least during most of the precompression phase, the container 

(3) is prevented from pressing against one of the closing pieces (13) by providing a 
small clearance (e) between said latter and the corresponding end of the container (3), 

the small clearance (e) allowing the air contained in the housing (4) to be progressively 
expelled during precompression of the billet (6) and up to the time said billet is fully 

applied against the internal face (43) of the housing (4). 
Extrusion process according to claim 1, characterized in that the clearance 
(e) is maintained between the container (3) and the first closing piece (13) by 

interposing a spacing device (7,7') between the corresponding face (31) of the 
container (3) and the crosspiece (1) on which it bears and which is able to exert a  

 
calibrated retaining force on the container (3) directed in the direction opposite to that 

in which the second closing piece (5) penetrates into the housing (4) and whose value 
is limited such that the said spacing means (7,7') yields under the pressure applied by 

the container (3) rigidly locked with the billet (6) and allowing the container (3) to 
advance and the first piece (13) to close when said retaining force exceeds a calibration 

limit value. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the calibration limit value 
of the retaining force corresponds to a pressure applied on the billet (6) from which the 

metal would tend to pass into the clearance (e) between the first closing piece (13) and 
the container (3). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that after 
the container (3) has been applied to the first closing piece (13), the hydraulic pressure 

in the extrusion control means (52) is released for a brief moment, bringing about a 
slight withdrawal of the billet (6) with the container (3) and the reopening of the first 

piece (13) under the action of the said spacing means (7,7') with the instantaneous 
creation of a clearance allowing any air to escape which was trapped inside the 

container (3) at the time the first piece (13) was closed. 
Press for extruding a metal billet comprising a first and a second fixed 
crosspieces (1,11) held apart from each other by a constant distance, a container (3) 

provided with a tubular housing (4) centered on an extrusion axis (10) and in which a 
billet (6) to be extruded is placed, said container (3) bearing, during extrusion, on the 

first crosspiece (1), two pieces (13,5) for closing the two ends of the housing (4) 
repectively, a bottom (13) carried by the first crosspiece (1) on which the container (3) 

bears, and a block (5) whose cross section is substantially identical to that of the 
housing, said block being mounted on the end of an extended rammer (51) bearing on 

the second fixed crosspiece (11) and able to penetrate into the housing (4) by an axial 
sliding movement, a die (14) centered on the extrusion axis (10) and which is mounted 

on the closing bottom (13), and means (52) which bear on the second crosspiece (11) 
to control the penetration of the pushing block (5) in the housing (4) in order to  

 
extrude the billet (6) through the die (14), characterized in that it comprises means 

(7,7') for spacing the container which are interposed between the first crosspiece (1) 
and the corresponding end (31) of the container (3) and extending over a sufficient 

distance to let a sufficient clearance (e) between the corresponding end (41) of the 
housing (4) and the closing bottom (13) to allow the air contained between the billet 

(6) and the inner face (43) of the housing (4) to be expelled when the billet (6) expands 
at the time the said closing pieces (13,5) start coming together. 
The extruding press according to claim 5, characterized in that the spacing 
means are made up of at least two hydraulic jacks (7,7') arranged either side of the 

extrusion axis (10) and each comprising a body (7,7') and a rod (72,72') which bear, 
respectively, on the first crosspiece (1) and on the corresponding end (31) of the 

container (3). 
Press for extruding a metal billet comprising a first and a second fixed 
crosspieces held apart from each other by a constant distance, a container provided 

with a tubular housing centered on an extrusion axis and in which a billet to be 
extruded is placed, said container bearing on a moveable crosspiece activated by an 

extrusion jack bearing on the first fixed crosspiece, two pieces for closing the two ends 
of the container housing, respectively a bottom carried by said moveable crosspiece 

and a block whose cross-section is substantially identical to that of the housing and 
bearing a die centered on the extrusion axis, said block being mounted on the end of an 

extended tubular rammer bearing on the second fixed crosspiece to which is pushed 
the moveable crosspiece bearing the container and the bottom thereof under the action 

of the extrusion jack with penetration of a the block by axial sliding inside the housing 
and extrusion of the billet by the die, characterized in that it comprises means for 

spacing the container which are interposed between the moveable crosspiece and the 
corresponding end of the container and extending over a sufficient distance to prevent 

the application of said latter against the moveable crosspiece to let a clearance between 
the container and the closing bottom to allow the air contained between the billet and  

 
the inner face of the housing to be expelled when the billet expands at the time the said 

closing pieces start coming together. 
The extrusion press according to claim 7, characterized in that the spacing 
means are made up of at least two hydraulic jacks arranged either side of the extrusion 

axis and each comprising a body and a rod which bear respectively on the moveable 
crosspiece and on the corresponding end of the container. 
The extrusion press according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that 
the spacing jacks (7,7') are associated with means (73) for releasing the pressure in the 

chamber (71) of each jack (7,7') when said latter exceeds a limit value.
