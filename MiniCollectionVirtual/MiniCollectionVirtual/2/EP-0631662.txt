A viscometer for improved sanitary measurement of the viscosity of industrial fluids. The present invention provides a viscometer integral with a flow meter or a viscometer that can be mounted onto an existing flow meter. The viscometer includes two adjacent parallel flow channels (46, 52) having relatively flat inner surfaces. A differential pressure element (70)is mounted between the adjacent flow channels to sense the differential pressure between the fluid flow of the two channels. The differential pressure is input along with the mass flow rate and fluid density to calculate the fluid viscosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of 
improved apparatus for and a method of measuring the 
viscosity of fluids flowing through a flow tube. The 
invention further relates to the provision of a 
Coriolis effect viscometer. The invention still 
further relates to the provision of a viscometer whose 
internal channels can easily be cleaned so as to make 
it suitable for applications having stringent sanitary 
requirements. Viscometers are presently used for measuring the 
viscosity of various types of fluids, e.g. gels, 
lubricating oils, and other materials that can flow 
through a tube or conduit. A number of existing 
methods are employed by these devices for measuring 
fluid viscosity. One such method is based upon 
Stoke's Law whereby the rate of movement of a rigid  
 
sphere through a fluid is proportional to the 
viscosity of the fluid. This method involves the 
travel of a dropped or rolling ball through the fluid. Another method involves the use of 
Hagen-Poiseuille's Equation for laminar fluids, i.e. 
fluids at low Reynolds numbers (less than 2000), and 
fluids with Newtonian characteristics. The viscosity 
of the flowing fluid, as determined by 
Hagen-Poiseuille's Equation, is proportional to the 
pressure change of the fluid as it flows through a 
tube as well as to the volumetric flow rate of the 
fluid. Prior art viscosity measurement devices 
utilizing Hagen-Poiseuille's Equation typically 
measure the pressure differential caused by the fluid 
flow at two distinct locations of the tube through 
which the fluid flows. The volumetric flow rate of 
the fluid is either already known or is measured by a 
flow meter. The viscosity is then determined from the 
measured differential pressure and the volumetric flow 
rate which is computed from the mass flow rate and 
measured density. These prior art viscometers measure the material 
viscosity on-line and typically require either flow 
diversion to a pressure transducer, or the protrusion 
of a pressure sensor into the flow of the fluid. This 
can cause various problems including problems with  
 
sanitary measurements of the fluid, problems with flow 
disturbances which can be critical when attempting to 
measure relatively low pressure drops with high 
accuracy, problems with the plugging of the diversion 
tubes which leads to uncontrollable offsets, and 
problems with the expense and complexity of the 
instrumentation required for these viscometers. Many viscometers applications require stringent 
sanitary conditions of the apparatus
