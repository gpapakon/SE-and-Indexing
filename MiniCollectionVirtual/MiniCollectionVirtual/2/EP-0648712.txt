<ABSTRACT>
In forming a plano-convex lens from a column-like lens 
blank by heating the blank to a temperature higher than the 

transition temperature thereof and by pressurizing an upper 
die with a closed space formed between the blank and the 

upper die, there are alternately repeated operations of 
pressurizing the upper die and stopping the application of 

pressure thereto. Through the control of the amount of 
displacement of the upper die, the maximum pressure of gas in 

the closed space at each pressurizing step is so controlled: 
to be sufficiently low with respect to the surface viscosity of the blank 

such that no local concave deformation in the 
surface of the blank is produced; and to be sufficiently high 

such that gas caught in the closed space is discharged during 
each step of stopping the application of pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for forming an optical element and particular, it
is related to a method for forming an optical element of the type as indicated in the
precharacterising portion of claim 1. Such a method is known from EP-A-O463463.Said conventional method comprises the steps of heating a glass blank to a temperature
higher than the transition temperature of said blank and pressing the heated blank
between opposed molding surfaces. Due to the respective configuration of blank and
mold surfaces, gas is trapped between the blank and molding surfaces whereby a
predetermined maximum pressure is obtained. Furthermore, said conventional method
comprises stopping said pressurisation where after a pressure release step is carried
out.A similar method for preparing an optical element blank in a predetermined shape is
know from JP-A-58-84134. As to such an optical element blank to be used for forming
under pressure, the shape thereof is desired to be as simple as possible in view of
workability and costs. As a typical example, there is proposed a forming method with the
use of a column-like blank (for example, JP-A-3-50126).In a conventional forming method, the forming operation has been conducted while
eliminating gas in a closed space between the blank and the mold by alternately
repeating pressurising and stopping the application of pressure. However, such a
method presents the problems that the forming precision is unstable, resulting in low
yield, and that predetermined precision is reached only with difficulty. It is the object of the present invention to provide a method of economically producing a
high precision optical element in a stable manner.The above object is achieved by the subject matter of claim 1. In particular, the
inventive method comprises pressurising and pressure-reducing steps which are
repeatedly carried out in intermittent intervals, such that the maximum pressure of gas in
the closed space between a blank and a forming mold at each pressurising step, is so
controlled: as to be low according to the surface viscosity of the blank is such that no
local concave in that surface of the blank is produced; and as to be high such that there
is formed, between the blank and the forming mold, a passage through which the gas in
the closed space is to be discharged at each pressure-reducing step.According to the inventive method there can be carried out a highly precise forming
which produces no crater-like gas holes in the transfer surface of the blank. More
specifically,

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming an optical element comprising the following steps:

heating an optical element blank (1) placed in a forming mold (3,4,5) to a temperature
higher than the transition temperature of said blank (1) such that said blank (1)

has a surface with viscosity capable of deforming said blank (1) under pressure;
pressurising said heated blank (1) with a forming surface (3a,4a) such that said blank is
deformed under pressure, along with an increase in pressure of gas caught in a

closed space (3b) formed between said blank (1) and said forming surface (3a) of said forming
mold (3) whereby a predetermined maximum pressure is obtained;
reducing the pressurising force to be exerted to said heated blank (1) from said
forming mold (3), wherein the gas caught in the closed space (3b) is partially discharged;
said pressurising step and said pressure-reducing step being alternately
repeatedly carried out,
characterized in that

the amount of displacement of the forming mold (3) is gradually reduced after every
pressure-reducing step to obtain a constant volume compression ratio and a

constant maximum pressure in the closed space (3b) formed between said blank (1) and
said forming surface (3a) whereby no local concave deformation in the surface of said

blank is produced. 
A method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of selecting a cylindrical
body as the blank (1) and a concave surface as the forming surface (3a) of the forming

mold (3), and

wherein the closed space (3b) is formed between an end surface of said blank (1) and
said concave forming surface (3a).
