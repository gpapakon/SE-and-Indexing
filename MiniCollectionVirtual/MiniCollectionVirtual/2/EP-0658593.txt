<ABSTRACT>
A process of reducing the effects of moisture during 
storage prior to vulcanization of a vulcanizable halogen-containing 

polymer composition containing water, comprising 
blending before storage, into said vulcanizable composition, a 

thioester derivative of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole 
crosslinking agent and polyethylene glyco
l, whereby the scorch 
time of the vulcanizable compound is not significantly affected 

by the water content of said composition. The invention is also 
directed to a vulcanizable halogen containing material and a dry 

pourable composition, both comprising the crosslinking agent and 
polyethylene glycol, as well as a process of reworking such a 

halogen-containing vulcanizable composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the production of vulcanized halogen-containing polymers,
the use of mercapto compounds as crosslinking agents, and the use
of various other additives to improve curing speed, strength and
stability of the vulcanizates are known. Vulcanization by these
conventional techniques tends to be erratic and not reproducible
if a mixed uncured composition has been stored. Scorching of the
fresh unvulcanized (green) material takes place during storage,
even at room temperature, which affects the cure conditions
required to manufacture useful parts.Scorching is thought to be the premature start of the curing
reaction, including some crosslinking, which affects subsequent
curing of the material. This may reduce the cure time to the
point where the compound cures before the part is properly
molded. Scorched compound may be partially gelled and have a
higher viscosity than unscorched compound. This may reduce flow
so that molds cannot be filled completely. Often improperly
cured products must be discarded.It has been observed that differences in water content of
the compositions appear to be largely responsible for the
scorching. Water may be absorbed by the green compositions from
humidity in the air, or by inclusion in the individual ingredients,
notably carbon black. Such vulcanizable compositions
absorb water in normal storage, usually in an amount ranging from
0.05% to 2% by weight depending on the relative
humidity and the length of storage.U. S. Patent No. 4,128,510 describes the use of broad classes
of derivatives of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole as
crosslinking agents for halogen-containing polymers to produce 
vulcanizates of increased strength and stability.U. S. Patent No. 4,288,576 discloses the use as the
crosslinking agent of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole in the
presence of certain basic materials to produce vulcanizates of
good stability.U. S. Patent No. 4,482,681 shows the use of a crosslinking
system for halogen-containing polymers made up of a polymercapto
compound or an ester derivative thereof as the crosslinking
agent, a basic material and a hydrated salt to increase the rate
of crosslinking.U. S. Patent No. 4,745,147 discloses curable compositions
comprising chlorinated polyethylene, a polymercapto compound, an
aliphatic polyhydroxy compound, an inorganic acid acceptor and an
initiator which is an amine, or a quaternary ammonium salt or a
quaternary phosphonium salt. Aliphatic polyhydroxy alcohols
mentioned include 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol,
glycerol,
