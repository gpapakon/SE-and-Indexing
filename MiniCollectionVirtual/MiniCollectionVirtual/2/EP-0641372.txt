<DESCRIPTION>
This application was made in part with Government support under
cooperative agreement number DMR 89-20147 awarded by the National Science
Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention.This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Serial No. 07/694,840
filed May 2, 1991, incorporated herein by reference, and U.S. Serial No.
07/885,154, filed May 18, 1992, incorporated herein by reference.The present invention relates generally to liquid crystalline light
modulating devices, and more specifically to new phase-separated polymeric-liquid
crystalline display cells and materials which exhibit different optical states
under different electrical field conditions and are characterized by a unique
combination of properties, including optical multistability and haze-free light
transmission at all viewing angles in either a field-ON or field-OFF mode.Electrically switchable liquid crystal-polymer films intended for use in
various electro-optical devices have been prepared by mechanical entrapment
procedures. One such technique involves imbibing liquid crystal into micropores
of a plastic or glass sheet. Another technique involves evaporation of water
from an aqueous emulsion of nematic liquid crystal in a solution of water-soluble
polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol or in a latex emulsion.A different procedure offering significant advantages over mechanical
entrapment techniques and the emulsification procedure involves phase
separation of nematic liquid crystal from a homogeneous solution with a suitable
synthetic resin to form a liquid crystal phase dispersed with a polymer phase.
The resulting materials are referred to as polymer dispersed liquid crystal 
(PDLC) films. Some of the advantages of PDLC films are discussed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,671,618; 4,673,255; 4,685,771; and 4,788,900; the disclosures of
which are incorporated by reference. PDLC films have been shown to be useful
in many applications ranging from large area displays and switchable coatings for
windows to projection displays and high-definition television.The methods of phase separation can be carried out by polymerization
initiated by addition of a curing agent, by ultraviolet light or by cooling into the
region of immiscibility. Another method is evaporating a solvent from a matrix-producing
composition of a solution of polymer and liquid crystal in the solvent.In windows or displays as described above in which the ordinary index of
refraction of the liquid crystal is matched to the refractive index of the polymer,
