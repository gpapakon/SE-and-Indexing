<ABSTRACT>
In a data transmission apparatus for 
transmitting digital video and audio data, a block 

forming circuit forms a plurality of data blocks of 
transmission data composed of at least one of digital 

video data, digital audio data, and digital auxiliary 
data related to the digital video data and the digital 

audio data. Thereafter, a grouping circuit groups a 
plurality of data blocks outputted from the block forming 

circuit so as to form transmission group data of one 
transmission unit block having a time length of 

approximately one three-hundredth second, and then 
transmits the transmission group data. Further, a 

classifying circuit preferably classifies the 
transmission group data into a plurality of sections, by 

adding section identification data to each transmission 
group data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission apparatus for transmitting
inputted digital data to be recorded in a plurality of sector of each track on a
recording medium, together with inputted first application ID data representing a
structure of each said track and inputted second application ID data representing
a structure of each said sectors, said apparatus comprising: DIF-ID generating
means for generating digital interface ID data based on said inputted first application
ID data and said inputted second application ID data, and at least one block
forming means for forming a data block including said digital data to be recorded
and said digital interface ID data generated by said DIF-ID generating means, and
outputting said data block.The invention is also concerned with a method for transmitting inputted digital data
to be recorded in a plurality of sector of each track on a recording medium,
together with inputted first application ID data representing a structure of each said
track and inputted second application ID data representing a structure of each said
sectors, said method including the following steps of: generating digital interface
ID data based on said inputted first application ID data and said inputted second
application ID data, and forming a data block including said digital data to be
recorded and said generated digital interface ID data, and outputting said data
block. There has been currently a development of
digital VCRs for recording video and audio in a form of
digital signals expressed by 0s and 1s, respectively, for
the purpose of achieving high-quality video and audio.
One of major features of the digital VCRs is that the
qualities of video and audio signals are not deteriorated
through dubbing these signals. In the digital VCR, an
audio signal, a video signal and the other control signal
or the like are recorded in a form of digital signals on
a magnetic tape, respectively.Since transmission of data is executed in a 
form of a digital signal between the digital VCRs, the
transmitted data does not change in the transmission
stage. Therefore, the recorded data can be transmitted
as it is from an audio visual apparatus to another audio
visual apparatus.In particular, in a digital VCR for consumer
use, the video signal is recorded onto the magnetic tape
in a form of a compressed video signal so that the amount
of data to be recorded thereonto can be reduced for the
purpose of reducing the amount of consumption of the
magnetic tape. In order to transmit a video
