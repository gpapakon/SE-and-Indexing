<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and a device for cutting moving webs of paper or similar material. Here, the dust occurring during cutting is to be removed in an advantageous way. To achieve this object, an electrostatic collecting or removing device is provided. The advantage of the electrostatic removal or collection of the dust generated in cutting consists in the fact that the energy otherwise necessary for producing suction air for sucking off the dust is reduced.
