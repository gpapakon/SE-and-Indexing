<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with viscosity index improving additives 
for lubricating oils and, more particularly, to a method for making a compatibilizer 
for a concentrated viscosity index improving blend of a poly(meth)acrylate 
copolymer and a polyolefin copolymer. Lubricating oil compositions for internal combustion engines typically 
include polymeric additives for improving the viscosity index of the lubricating 
composition, that is, modifying the relationship between temperature and the 
viscosity of the oil composition to reduce the temperature dependence of the 
viscosity, to lower the "pour point" of the composition, that is, to allow the 
composition to remain fluid at reduced temperature, and to provide "dispersant" 
properties, that is, to allow sludge particles to remain suspended in the oil 
composition. Poly(alkyl methacrylate) (PMA) copolymeric additives and olefinic 
copolymer (OCP) additives are two classes of copolymers that are used as viscosity 
index improvers in lubricating oils. In general, PMA additives provide better low 
temperature performance than OCP additives, while OCP additives provide higher 
thickening efficiency than PMA additive, so that relatively less OCP additive is 
required to provide an equivalent thickening effect in the oil composition. Dispersant properties may be imparted to PMA additives by incorporating 
monomeric units derived from nitrogenous comonomers into the copolymer, and 
may be imparted to OCP additives by grafting nitrogenous branches onto the OCP 
backbone. Some nitrogenous dispersant additives have been found to degrade 
fluoropolymer gaskets and seals. Since fluoropolymer gaskets and seals are enjoying 
increased acceptance in the automotive industry, there is a growing interest in non-nitrogenous 
dispersant additives. PMA/OCP blends which provide a balance of the desirable properties of each 
type of additive are known. Coassigned US-A-4,622,031 discloses concentrated 
blends of a nitrogen-containing PMA, an OCP and a "compatibilizer" graft 
copolymer having PMA branches grafted onto an OCP backbone, each dissolved in 
a hydrocarbon fluid. The compatibilizer copolymer stabilizes the 
thermodynamically incompatible PMA and OCP additives to discourage separation 
of the blend into discrete phases. US-A-5,188,770 discloses a concentrated emulsion 
including a poly(alkyl methacrylate) copolymer and an olefin copolymer wherein  
 
alkyl methacrylate monomers are polymerized in an oil compatible liquid vehicle in 
the presence of an
