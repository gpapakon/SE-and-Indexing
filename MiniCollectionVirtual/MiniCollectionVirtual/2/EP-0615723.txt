<ABSTRACT>
Blood flow, particularly cerebral blood flow, can be 
safely measured based on existence of a light absorption 

peak in the near infra-red (NIR) light region for normal 
water and the absence of such a peak for heavy water. 

Heavy water is intra-arterially injected into a patient. 
A patient's head (4) is irradiated with NIR light from a 

source (3). NIR light emerging from the patient's head (4) 
is detected by a photo multiplier tube (6) and changes in 

the light reception caused by changes in the concentration 
of normal water are monitored. A decrease in the amount of 

light absorption indicates passage of the heavy water 
through the area being measured. The time required for 

passage of the heavy water is used to calculate the blood 
flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for measuring cerebral blood flow and particularly 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) using heavy water as a tracer. Proper supply of blood to the brain is essential for 
the brain, and consequently other body organs, to function 
properly and to maintain the life of the individual. 
Accurately measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) is therefore 
an indispensable tool for diagnosing some critical patients. 
Several techniques have been proposed which use tracers for 
determining CBF in patients. In one method the tracer 
injected into a patient is a radioactive substance, commonly 
¹³³xenon. A γ-ray sensor is attached to the patient's head 
for sensing changes in strength in radioactivity from the 
radioactive substance. A rapid increase and decrease in the 
radioactive strength would presume rapid blood flow. In this 
way, measured radioactivity values reveal CBF. In another 
technique the tracer injected into a patient is a light-absorbing 
pigment, such as cardio-green. Light is directed 
on the patient's head. Changes in the amount of light 
absorbed by the pigment are monitored to determine the rate 
at which the pigment flows, and indirectly the rate at which 
blood flows. However there has been known a serious drawback with 
these techniques in that the radioactive and pigment tracers 
adversely affect living tissue. Countries and organizations 
often prohibit injecting these injurious tracers into human 
subjects. Even when circumstances allow their use, the 
potential for harm prevents repeated applications. Although  
 
measuring blood flow with tracers provides more accurate and 
stable measurements than the Doppler method, the above 
problem with using radioactive or pigment tracers severely 
limits their application in clinical situations. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a method and apparatus for 
measuring a blood flow using a harmless substance as a tracer 
safely, accurately and conveniently to measure the blood 
flow. To achieve the above and other objects, there is 
provided according to one aspect of the invention a method of 
measuring blood flow according to the present invention 
comprising the steps of (a) injecting into a first portion of 
a blood vessel a predetermined quantity of a liquid 
containing heavy water, (b) irradiating with light of a 
predetermined wavelength region a second portion downstream 
from the first portion, (c) detecting light emerging from the 
second portion,
