<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molluscicides
and in particular to the molluscicidal use of certain
nitromethylene compounds.Nitromethylene compounds are well known for
their insecticidal properties, and have been the subject
of many and varied patent disclosures.It has now been found that certain substituted
nitromethylene forms have a significant molluscicidal
activity, particularly against gastropods, e.g. slugs and
snails, and especially against slugs.It has previously been suggested in European
Patent Specification No. 437784, that certain substituted
nitromethylene imidazolidine derivatives, including
compounds of the formula:

wherein A is a 6-chloro-3-pyridyl group and X is a
substituted thio-methyl group, are effective against soil
pests such as slugs and snails; however, there are no
test examples showing such molluscicidal activity.
Tests using the slug, Derocerasreticulatum, now carried
out on the compounds of Examples 2 and 3 of EP-A-437784
detected no useful molluscicidal activity. DE-A-4111389 discloses the use of Imidacloprid,
which is Compound No. 13 of Table 2 herein, as a ground-beetle
repellant in molluscicidal compositions in which
the molluscicidally active ingredient is 3,5-dimethyl-4-methylthiophenyl-N-methyl
carbonate (Mercaptodimethur).
This prior art document states that Imidacloprid itself
has only a relatively poorly developed molluscicidal
effectiveness.It is well known that many types of mollusc are
agricultural and horticultural pests. Recent changes in
farming practice have led to an increase in varieties of
crops which are slug-susceptible, and the environmental
pressures which prevent or restrict stubble-burning and
encourage straw incorporation can be expected to
aggravate existing mollusc, e.g. slug problems.Current commercial sluggicides include
metaldehyde and carbamates such as methiocarb.
Carbamate molluscicides are highly effective but suffer
from a high toxicity to mammals and other non-target
organisms such as earthworms and hedgehogs.
The metaldehyde molluscicide has a lower toxicity level
but is not truly lethal to molluscs inducing a narcotic
or desiccant effect to immobilise the mollusc pests.There is a need for a useful molluscicide which
is fully effective against e.g. slugs and snails, but
also has a low toxicity to non-target species, e.g.
mammals.The present invention provides the use of a
compound of the general formula:
