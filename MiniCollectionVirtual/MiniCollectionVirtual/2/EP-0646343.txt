<ABSTRACT>
In order to control, according to the norms for flickering and without system perturbations, the heat output of at least two heating resistors (R1, R2), connected electrically in parallel, of electric household appliances, is proposed according to the invention that the switches (S1, S2) switched in series to the heating resistors are driven in a clocked fashion in such a way that always only exactly one switch is closed and all the other switches are open and that the respectively closed switch passes nothing but system full waves.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical circuit arrangement of the single-line system, 
having at least two electrically shunt-connected heating 

resistors of electric household appliances, in particular 
electric toasters, a switch being connected in series to 

each heating resistor and the switches being triggered by 
means of an electronic trigger device, a closed switch 

transmitting exclusively full waves of the system, 

characterized in
 that the switches during a heating phase 
are triggered in such a clocked manner that there is always 

precisely only one switch closed and all of the other 
switches are open and each heating resistor in dependence 

upon the adjusted clock-pulse ratio supplies between 0 and 
100% of its heat output, the maximum clock frequency 

corresponding to the system frequency.
