<ABSTRACT>
Documents (D) stacked in a document tray (3) are fed 
from the lowermost sheet by a feeding belt (5) and then by a 

feeding belt (10) to a light exposure station (9) via 
feeding rollers (6, 8), and after light exposure are 

recirculated onto the uppermost sheet of the document tray 
(3) by a inverted feeding roller (13) via an ejection roller 

(11). When the documents (D) are double-sided, they are 
invertedly fed in the direction of a feeding path (19) by 

the feeding roller (8), fed to the light exposure station 
(9), and each side of the documents (D) presented for light 

exposure. Here, when trouble occurs in the copying unit, 
the document in the feeding path is returned to the document 

tray (3) while recirculative feeding of the documents 
remaining in the document tray (3) is performed for 

automatic restoration of the documents to their originally 
stacked state when returned to the tray. Therefore, only 

the minimum necessary number of documents are fed through 
the inverted feeding path (19). 
Thus, restoration of the 
initial stacked state of the documents may be carried out 

automatically for shortening of the time required therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging apparatus
such as a copier or printer, equipped with a document
circulating feeder, which has a construction for restoration
control at the document-circulating feeder end in the event
of trouble occurring at the imaging apparatus end.When making multiple copies from a number of documents,
imaging apparatuses, for example copiers for copying images
of documents, automatically feed the documents to a copying
station, i.e. a light exposure station, and produce the
desired number of copies. During the process, the outputted
copied sheets are sorted by a sorter equipped with a
plurality of trays, as means for placing the copied sheets
in the serial page order of the documents.With the aim of eliminating the need for such sorters, 
there have been proposed and put into practical use, as
document feeders for the above-mentioned type of
apparatuses, automatic recirculating document handlers of
the type which produce only one copy each time the document
to be copied is passed through the light exposure station,
without producing all the indicated number of copies once,
and then return it back to the document tray for its
recirculation once again to the light exposure station. In
this manner, since the circulating documents are copied one
page at a time, the copied sheets are outputted after being
collated in the same serial page order as the documents, and
thus the circulation of the documents also serves as a
sorting operation, eliminating the need for a sorter and
allowing the device to be made smaller.As a conventional measure against cases where trouble
occurs while feeding the documents, such as jams at the
automatic recirculating document handler (RDH) end or the
copying unit end, there is provided means at the RDH end for
jam recovery, i.e. for resuming copying, after the jam has
been cleared, from the document at which the jam has
occurred. For example, in the case of an automatic
recirculating document handler such as the one disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication JP-A 1-166056 (1989), a job
resuming function returns documents which have jammed at the
RDH end back to the RDH in the correct order. There is 
disclosed a resuming function in which, when jamming of a
document occurs at the RDH, the location of the fed but
suspended document is determined and a paper feeding path
separate from the circulative feeding path is used for
restoration to resume copying in the order of the documents.Furthermore, when the jam is not at the RDH end but at
the copying
