<ABSTRACT>
The hitherto known devices for covering a window opening or door opening have the disadvantage that the covering element can be pushed upwards out of the unwound position by an unauthorized person, as a result of which this person can pass through the window opening or door opening into the interior of the building. This is avoided in that the device according to the invention exhibits, in the lateral guide rails, a rubber stop moulding and, opposite this, an expandable hose which, after the supply of compressed air, presses the covering element, e.g. an insect screen, fixedly against the rubber moulding. In order to supply the compressed air, a small pneumatic pump is provided on the inner side of the window. The device thus offers a high degree of protection against break-in since the insect screen has to be destroyed if an intruder wants to penetrate through the window opening or door opening located behind said screen. Moreover, it is ensured that even extremely strong gusts of wind cannot wrench the insect screen out of the lateral guide rails.
