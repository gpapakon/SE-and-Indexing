<ABSTRACT>
A signal despreader (205) for use in a CDMA system processes samples 
of the received signal with filtered replicas of the code coefficient sequences 

associated with the system users. The symbols transmitted by each system user 
(received on 203,204) are recovered using a filtered replica (from 307,308) of that 

user's associated code coefficient sequence. In the disclosed embodiment, the 
communications channel between each system user's transmitter and the base station 

is bandlimited. Accordingly, within each user's transmitter, filtering apparatus 
having a frequency characteristic is utilized to limit the frequency spectrum of each 

coded signal to a predetermined bandwidth equal to or less than that of the 
communications channel. Each filtered replica, pursuant to the present invention, 

reflects this frequency characteristic. In addition, the communications channel also 
has a frequency characteristic, and each filtered replica can reflect this characteristic 

as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and
methods for use in a Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) system.CDMA is a signal modulation technique used in a variety of
applications, such as cellular and wireless communications systems. In such
systems, multiple users communicate at will over a common frequency band with a
base station. Each of these users transmits a uniquely coded signal. Therefore, the
received signal at the base station is a composite of many differently coded signals.
Each coded signal is formed by multiplying each of a succession of digital symbols
by more than one code coefficient. The product of each symbol times one code
coefficient is a "chip" and each chip extends over a portion of the bit interval known
as a chip interval. At the receiver, each user's encoded digital symbols are recovered
from the incoming composite signal using code coefficients which replicate those
used by each user.It has long been recognized that during transmission a substantial
amount of interference can be introduced into each coded signal from the other
coded signals and compensation for this interference must be provided for
intelligible communications. To reduce this interference, a number of different
interference reduction techniques have been devised. In one prior art technique,
apparatus is used in the receiver which operates on each user's symbols outputted by
a despreader using priorly recovered other users' symbols. See, for example, U.S.
Patent No. 5,136,612, issued August 4, 1992 and entitled "Method and Apparatus for
Reducing Effects of Multiple Access Interference in a Radio Receiver in a Code
Division Multiple Access Communication System." Another class of prior art
systems uses an approach which operates on the received composite signal over a
time interval using blocks of code coefficients wherein each block includes the code
coefficients of each user corresponding to this time interval. See, for example, a
publication entitled "Near-Far Resistance of Multiuser Detectors in Asynchronous
Channels," I.E.E.E.TransactionsonCommunications, Vol. 38, No. 4, April 1990,
and, more recently, a pending patent application entitled Data Recovery Technique
for Asynchronous CDMA Systems, Serial No. 07/982168, (US-A-5341395).Yet another class of prior art systems 
reduces interference by despreading the received signal using code coefficient
sequences which are different from those utilized by the users to generate their
respective coded signals. See, for example, pending U.S. application Serial No.
