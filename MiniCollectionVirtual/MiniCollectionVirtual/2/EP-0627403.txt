 where R has the meaning given above and M = H, K or an ammonium group, is reacted, in aqueous medium, at a temperature greater than or equal to 50@C, with formic acid in the presence of catalytic amounts of an oxygen-containing derivative of sulphur having a degree of oxidation of 2 to 4, in order to obtain the hydroxyphenylacetic acid of formula (I) which is isolated or, if desired, salified according to the usual methods, and hydroxyphenylacetic acid thus obtained.

Preparation process for a hydroxyphenylacetic 
acid of formula (I): 


 
in which R represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or an 

alkyl or alkoxyl group as well as its salts, characterized in 
that the corresponding free or salified hydroxymandelic acid 

of formula (II): 

 
in which R has the meaning given previously and M represents 

a hydrogen, sodium, potassium atom or an ammonium group, is 
reacted in an aqueous medium, at a temperature greater than 

or equal to 50°C, with formic acid in the presence of 
catalytic quantities of an oxygenated derivative of sulphur 

having an oxidation number from 2 to 4, in order to obtain 
the hydroxyphenylacetic acid of formula (I) which is isolated 

or, if desired, is salified according to the usual methods. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the oxygenated derivative of sulphur having an oxidation 

number from 2 to 4, is chosen from the group constituted by 
sulphur dioxide, sodium or potassium hydrogen sulphite, 

sodium or potassium sulphite, sodium or potassium disulphite, 
sodium or potassium dithionite, sodium or potassium 

thiosulphate.  
 
Process according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that it is carried out at a temperature 

comprised between 75 and 150°C. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it is carried out under a pressure of 2 

to 10 bars. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 and 4, 
characterized in that the starting product of formula (II) is 

hydroxymandelic acid of formula (II) in which M represents a 
hydrogen atom. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of 

1.1 ± 0.1 mole of formic acid per mole of starting product. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it is carried out under a pressure of 4 

to 5 bars and at a temperature of 100 to 130°C. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of 

catalytic quantities of sodium disulphite. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 and 8, 
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of 

0.10 ± 0.02 mole of sodium disulphite per mole of starting 
product.
