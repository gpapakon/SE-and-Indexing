<ABSTRACT>
A compact liquid-absorbent material which swells by absorbing rapidly a liquid such as water or petroleum. 
It is produced from a porous molding having a cross-linked polymer barrier and interconnected pores and has a density 

in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 g/cm³. Further this material is either one having a degree of swelling of the barrier with 
keros
ine of 2 to 10 and an absorption per unit volume of each of water, ethanol, toluene and kerosine of at least 4 
cm³/cm³, or one having an absorption per unit weight of each of water, ethanol, toluene and kerosine of 10 g/g at a 

temperature above the softening point of the cross-linked polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel liquid absorbable
material and a method for the production of the liquid
absorbable materials More particularly, it relates to a
compact liquid absorbable material which, on contact with a
liquid such as water, alcohol, or petroleum, quickly absorbs
the liquid therein and expands and does not easily release
the absorbed liquid even under load and a method for the
production of this liquid absorbable material.As a sparingly inflammable formed article of a
porous cross-linked polymer containing a large volume of
water, the cured article of a water-in-oil type emulsion
containing up to 90% of an inner water phase has been known
(British Patent No. 1,458,203, JP-A-47-29,479, and JP-A-48-94,785).As an application of this water-in-oil type
emulsion, JP-A-57-198,713 discloses a low-density porous
polymer. This polymer is known to be capable of absorbing
such a hydrophobic liquid as oil in the pores thereof. JP-A-60-217,204
and JP-A-60-217,205 disclose low-density
modified polystyrene porous cross-linked polymers having a
density of less than 0.2 g/cm3. These polymers are known to
be capable of absorbing oil and water in the pores thereof,
depending on the degree of modification. Besides, JP-A-62-250,002
discloses a knowledge that a low-density porous
cross-linked polymer possessing elasticity is obtained by
polymerizing an emulsion of a corresponding monomer while
controlling the diameter of discontinuous phase liquid drops
in the emulsion within a specific range.The polymers which are disclosed in the
aforementioned publications known to the prior art, however,
are low-density porous polymers and contain a large volume
of air in the pores which are distributed throughout their 
whole volume. To absorb a liquid, therefore, they require
to exchange the large volume of air contained therein for
the liquid. Owing to this exchange, they do not manifest
any ability to absorb the liquid quickly. Further, these
polymers suffer their pores to grow in diameter while they
are in the process of retaining the absorbed liquid in the
pores, they readily release the absorbed liquid when they
are exposed to pressure. Thus, these polymers exhibit only
a poor liquid retaining power under load.The elastic porous cross-linked polymer which is
disclosed in JP-A-62-250,002 has a large pore diameter and a
large porosity and assumes a spongy texture under normal
conditions. It it is elected to be used as a liquid
absorbable material, it will fail the service required of
the liquid absorbable material
