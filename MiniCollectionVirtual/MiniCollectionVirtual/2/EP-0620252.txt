<ABSTRACT>
A polyphenylene sulfide resin composition having the characteristics of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), such as injection 
moldability and mechanical strength, and excellent sliding characteristics which ordinary sliding material based on polytetrafluoroethylene 

(PTFE) has, such as friction and abrasion resistance. The composition comprises PPS as the matrix and fine PTFE 
particles having a mean particle diameter of 0.05-1 µm and being composed of a shell comprising a low-molecular PTFE incapable 

of fibrillation and a core comprising either a PTFE powder prepared by firing PTFE at above the melting point thereof and 
having the number-average molecular weight of at least 1.5 million and the mean particle diameter of 2-800 µm or a high-molecular 

PTFE capable of fibrillation and having the number-average molecular weight of at least 1.5 million, said fine PTFE particles 
being filled in the PPS matrix in the content of 40-80 wt.%. The production process comprises melt milling the PPS and the PTFE 

particles above the melting point of the PPS but below the melting point of the PTFE.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyphenylene
sulfide (hereinafter referred to as PPS) resin
composition, particularly relates to a PPS resin
composition which is filled with polytetrafluoroethylene
(hereinafter referred to as PTFE) at a high rate and is
suitable for sliding parts such as bearings, sliding pads
and guiding parts for automobiles and industrial
machineries.PPS is a resin having excellent heat resistance,
mechanical properties and molding property and it is a big
advantage, in view of industrial uses, that injection
molding can be applied to PPS resins. Meanwhile PTFE is
commercially available in the form of fine particles and
powder as materials for molding, and is widely utilized,
making the best use of properties such as heat and cold
resistance, flame retardance, non-tackiness, stain
resistance, chemical resistance, weatherability and
electrical properties. PTFE is also used as sliding
materials. PTFE is not melt-processable by means of
injection molding and is usually molded by
compression molding of which productivity is low.PPS resin compositions which is filled with
PTFE, are commercially available as resin compositions
having excellent sliding properties. Such resin
compositions usually contain up to 30 % by weight of PTFE
on the basis of a weight of compositions. Though those
compositions have such characteristics as higher
mechanical strength, good moldability and injection
moldability, they are insufficient, as sliding materials,
in sealing property, friction and wear resistance and 
impact resistance as compared with commercially available
sliding materials (for instance, molding powder containing
Polyflon TFE fillers of Daikin Industries, Ltd. ) having
PTFE as a matrix.JP-A JP-A-119040/1975 discloses that unbaked PTFE
having a molecular weight of not less than 0.3 million
(equal to the melt viscosity of about 6 × 105 poises as
referred to hereinafter) is blended with PPS in an amount
of 0.5 to 50 % by weight and kneaded. For unbaked PTFE,
PTFE powder so-called molding powder is used, and impact
strength of the obtained PPS resin compositions is
improved because of fibrillation of PTFE powder.
According to Examples of that patent application, a PTFE
content is 30 % by weight even at maximum. If PPS resin
compositions are so prepared by the method disclosed in
that publication as to contain PTFE at a rate as high as
that of the present invention, the injection moldability
inherent to PPS is lost due to said fibrillation.JP-A-232457/1987 discloses that 1 to 80 parts by
