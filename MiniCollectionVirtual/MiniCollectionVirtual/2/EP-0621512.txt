<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic toner for
developing an electrostatic image, used in image
forming processes such as electrophotography and
electrostatic recording, to render electrostatic
latent images visible.As electrophotography, various methods are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,297,691, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 42-23910 and Japanese Patent
Publication No. 43-24748 and so forth.Developing systems applied in such
electrophotography are roughly grouped into a dry
developing method and a wet developing method. The
former is further grouped into a method making use of
one-component developers and a method making use of
two-component developers. The developing method
making use of one-component developer has a feature
that developing apparatus can be made small-sized.
This method, however, has difficulty in imparting
sufficient triboelectricity to the toner and hence it
has a problem that the allowable scope of the
designing of toners and developing systems is narrow. 
On the other hand, the developing method making use of
the two-component developer can impart sufficient
charges to toners and hence has the advantage that it
has wider tolerance for designing, but has a problem
that it requires a means for uniformly controlling the
mixing ratio of the toner and the carrier, making its
apparatus complicated.As toners used in these developing methods,
fine powders comprising a colorant such as a dye or
pigment dispersed in a natural or synthetic resin are
hitherto used. For example, toner particles are
prepared by pulverizing a dispersion of a colorant in
a binder resin such as polystyrene to a size of about
1 to 30 µm. As a magnetic toner, toner particles
containing magnetic material particles such as
magnetite are used.Toners have positive charges or negative
charges depending on the polarity of electrostatic
latent images to be developed. In order to charge
toners, it is possible to utilize triboelectric
chargeability of resins that compose toners. In such
a method, however, the chargeability of the toner is
so small that toner images obtained by development
tend to be foggy and unclear. In order to impart a
desired triboelectric chargeability to toners, a dye
or pigment capable of controlling chargeability and
also a charge control agent are commonly added. However, toners containing such charge control
agents tend to contaminate the toner carrying members
such as the developing sleeve, and hence such toners
tend to cause a decrease in quantity of
triboelectricity as the number of copies
