<ABSTRACT>
A furnace system wherein heat from a furnace is 
radiated through a furnace exit port (3) to a reradiating 

wall (5) outside the furnace in a reradiation zone (2) located 
between the furnace and the flue and reradiated back 

therefrom to the furnace, and the gas flow area in the 
reradiation zone (2) past the reradiation wall (5) is greater 

than or equal to the gas flow area of the furnace exit 
port (3) enabling high velocity gas flow from the furnace 

to impinge upon the reradiation wall and increase heat 
recovery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to furnace 
systems and is particularly advantageous when the 
furnace is heated by oxy-fuel combustion. Furnaces are employed in a large number of 
industrial processes such as glassmaking, steelmaking, 
metal smelting and cement manufacturing. Generally 
heat is provided for the operation of the furnace by 
the combustion of a fuel, such as natural gas, with 
air. Although air is relatively inexpensive for use in 
such combustion, there are several disadvantages to the 
use of air which are causing furnace operators to 
change from air-based combustion to oxy-fuel 
combustion. Since air is comprised of nearly 80 
percent incombustible nitrogen, a large amount of the 
heat produced by the combustion is consumed in heating 
the nitrogen rather than heating the furnace charge 
such as the glass or steel. Moreover, the large volume 
of air which must be used and the consequent pressure 
drop in the system increases the costs of the fluid 
handling equipment. Still further, the presence of the 
large amount of nitrogen creates conditions for the 
generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in carrying out the 
combustion which are generally recognized as being 
harmful pollutants. These problems may be significantly reduced by the 
use of oxy-fuel combustion in place of air-based 
combustion for the generation of heat to operate a 
furnace. One economic disadvantage with oxy-fuel 
combustion is the added cost of oxygen which is  
 
required in proportion to the amount of fuel input. It 
is particularly important to reduce furnace heat losses 
with oxy-fuel combustion so that both fuel and oxygen 
requirements are minimized. Radiation heat loss 
through a furnace exit is a source of inefficiency in 
operating the furnace. Accordingly it is an object of the invention to 
provide a system wherein heat is provided into the 
furnace, particularly by oxy-fuel combustion, and 
wherein radiation heat loss through the flue is 
reduced. The above and other objects which will become 
apparent to one skilled in the art upon a reading of 
this disclosure are attained by the present invention 
one aspect of which is:
