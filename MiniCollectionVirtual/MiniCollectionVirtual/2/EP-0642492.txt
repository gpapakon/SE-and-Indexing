<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to symmetrical and asymmetrical 
5,5'-[(1,3-propanediyl)bis[imino(2-oxo-2,1-ethanediyl)acetylimino]]bis(2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenedicarboxyamides), 
useful as opacifyng component of X-ray 
contrast media, of general formula (I) 
 
wherein: 
R,R',R1,R1',which are the same or different, are H, 
C1-C4 alkyl, linear or branched C1-C4 
mono- or polyhydroxyalkyl, R2,R2',R3,R3',which are the same or different, are one 
of the groups of formula -CH2CH2OH, 
-CH2CH(OH)CH2OH, -CH(CH2OH)CH(OH)CH2OH, 
-CH2(CHOH)4CH2OH or -CH(CH2OH)2, Xis one of the groups -CH(OH)-, 
-CH(CH2OH)-, -C(OH)(CH2OH)- or 
-C(CH2OH)2-,  
as well as enantiomers, diastereoisomers and/or rotamers 
thereof.  
 This inventions also includes the process for preparing 
these non-ionic compounds, as well as the X-ray 
contrast media containing them as opacifying components. Preferred compounds of formula (I) are those in 
which R, R', R1, R1' are H or CH3 and X is -CH(OH)- or 
-C(CH2OH)2-. Particularly preferred are those in which 
R, R', R1, R1' are H and X is -CH(OH)-. Compounds of formula (I) belong to the class of 
non-ionic contrast media for X-ray diagnosis, which are 
more and more replacing the salts of 2,4,6-triiodo-benzoic 
acid derivatives, up to now widely used, in view 
of their better tolerability and minimum tendency to 
produce side effects. Thanks to the elimination of ionic 
species, non-ionic solutions, in comparison with 
ionic agents, are characterized by the same iodine content 
and a lower osmotic pressure, therefore a lower 
osmolality. For this reason, for instance in angiography, 
they cause less pain and lower endothelial damages. 
And in subarachnoidal administration used in 
myelography or cysternography, cases of arachnoiditis 
or epileptical episodes are very rare while they are 
frequent when ionic contrast media are used. 
Unfortunately, despite their remarkable physical and 
pharmacological properties, non-ionic contrast media, 
basically consisting of monocyclic aromatic triiodinated 
nuclei, are too much hypertonic at the high dosages 
and concentrations required for many specific examinations. 
This fact led to the development of hexaiodinated 
dimeric products, in which osmolality is further 
reduced in accordance with iodine concentration. However,  
 
the concentrated solutions of those compounds are 
often too much viscous. In addition, a large number of 
products, although theoretically promising, are not 
enough soluble. EP-A-0108638 describes a non-ionic X-ray contrast 
agent having a
