<ABSTRACT>
Complex resource configurations often exist in multiprocessor systems. Because of this, competing access to a specific resource configuration by a plurality of processors results in coordination problems. The invention solves the problems by the fact that a central protection (security) table is introduced and that a processor has to leave its processor number there with a specific protection number, if it wants to obtain control over the resource configuration associated with this protection number.

<CLAIMS>
Method for a plurality of user instances to edit
connections or transactions, according to which


a) every connection or transaction is allocated a
respective security number which is concomitantly

stored for every resource used for the connection
or transaction,
b) a user instance's access to a used resource is
preceded by the security number concomitantly

stored for this resource being withdrawn and a
central storage means attempting to store the user

instance's incarnation number for this security
number,
c) any attempt by a user instance to access a used
resource is rejected if, during the attempt at

storage, it is established that another user
instance's incarnation number is already stored

for this security number.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized

in that
 the central storage means is in the form of a
table, with the user instance's incarnation number

being stored at that table location which corresponds
to the security number.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 

in that
 the security numbers (SID) provided are
allocated cyclically.
