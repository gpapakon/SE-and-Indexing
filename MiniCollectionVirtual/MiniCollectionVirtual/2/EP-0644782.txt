<ABSTRACT>
Systems for performing peritoneal dialysis having an improved user interface functions and monitoring capabilities. In one respect, the systems discriminate between alarm conditions that require user intervention to correct and alarm conditions that reflect conditions that are anomalies but typically correct themselves with minimum or no user intervention. In another respect, the systems identify occluded liquid flow paths and discriminate whether the flow path is associated with a liquid source or a liquid destination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a peritoneal dialysis
system and a method
of monitoring liquid flow in such a system.Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) periodically
infuses sterile aqueous solution into the peritoneal
cavity. This solution is called peritoneal dialysis
solution, or dialysate. Diffusion and osmosis
exchanges take place between the solution and the
bloodstream across the natural body membranes.
These exchanges remove the waste products that the
kidneys normally excrete. The waste products
typically consist of solutes like sodium and
chloride ions, and the other compounds normally
excreted through the kidneys like urea, creatinine,
and water. The diffusion of water across the
peritoneal membrane during dialysis is called
ultrafiltration.Conventional peritoneal dialysis solutions
include dextrose in concentrations sufficient to
generate the necessary osmotic pressure to remove
water from the patient through ultrafiltration.Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis
(CAPD) is a popular form of PD. A patient performs
CAPD manually about four times a day. During CAPD,
the patient drains spent peritoneal dialysis
solution from his/her peritoneal cavity. The 
patient then infuses fresh peritoneal dialysis
solution into his/her peritoneal cavity. This drain
and fill procedure usually takes about 1 hour.Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) is another
popular form of PD. APD uses a machine,
called a cycler, to automatically infuse, dwell, and
drain peritoneal dialysis solution to and from the
patient's peritoneal cavity. APD is particularly
attractive to a PD patient, because it can be
performed at night while the patient is asleep.
This frees the patient from the day-to-day demands
of CAPD during his/her waking and working hours.The APD sequence typically last for several
hours. It often begins with an initial drain cycle
to empty the peritoneal cavity of spent dialysate.
The APD sequence then proceeds through a succession
of fill, dwell, and drain phases that follow one
after the other. Each fill/dwell/drain sequence is
called a cycle.During the fill phase, the cycler transfers
a predetermined volume of fresh, warmed dialysate
into the peritoneal cavity of the patient. The
dialysate remains (or "dwells") within the
peritoneal cavity for a time. This is called the
dwell phase. During the drain phase, the cycler
removes the spent dialysate from the peritoneal
cavity.The number of fill/dwell/drain cycles that
are required during a given APD session depends upon
the total volume of dialysate prescribed for the
patient'

pumping means (P1,PA1) for moving liquid from the source (20) towards
the pumping means, and control means (16) including monitor means for

generating a first command signal when the pumping means fails to move
liquid from the source, through the source tubing (32) to the pumping

means,

to the first command signal, to operate the pumping means (P1,PA1) to

attempt to move liquid from the pumping means (P1,PA1) through the
source tubing (32) towards the source and, if successful, registering an

empty source condition and, if not successful, registering an occluded
source tubing condition.

a liquid flow rate by measuring liquid volume moved by the pumping

mechanism over a prescribed time period and generates the first command
signal when the derived flow rate is less than a predetermined value.

comprises a diaphragm (59) overlying a pump chamber (P1) and operable

in response to applied fluid pressure for moving liquid through the pump
chamber.
A system according to Claim 3, wherein the monitor means senses
fluid pressure variations during operation of the pumping means (P1,PA1)

second command signal when the pumping means fails to move liquid
from the pumping means (P1,PA1) through the destination tubing (26)

towards the destination (22), and the control means (16) is operative in
response to the second command signal to cause the pumping means
