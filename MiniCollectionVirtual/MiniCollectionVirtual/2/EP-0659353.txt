<ABSTRACT>
A kit for making a smoking article comprises a hull 10 
which itself comprises a hollow cylinder 14 of cigarette paper 

having a filter at one end joined to it by tipping 16. The kit 
also includes a rectangular sheet 12 of reconstituted tobacco, 

the long side of which is the same length as the cylinder. The 
smoker rolls the sheet into a cylindrical shape and inserts it 

into the hull to make a cigarette.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kit for making a smoking
article for assembly by a smoker. It also relates to a novel
smoking article.It is known to provide, separately, unsmokable components of
cigarettes to smokers for assembly into smokable cigarettes.
Conventionally, a tobacco rod wrapped in a very high porosity
paper wrapper and, separately, an empty hull consisting of a
cylinder of conventional cigarette wrapper closed at one end by a
conventional filter plug attached to the wrapper by conventional
tipping are provided.The porosity of the very high porosity wrapper is such that the
tobacco rod cannot be smoked. It is chosen, bearing in mind the
packing density and other characteristics of the tobacco in the
rod, to ensure that this is the case. Typical porosity values
for the very high porosity wrappers are around 20000 Coresta
units. The smoker inserts the tobacco rod into a hull to make a
smokable cigarette. A cigarette of this type is disclosed in
EP-0 155 514, in which the tobacco rod has a wrapper with many
large perforations, rendering it unsmokable.Another cigarette component system, described in European Patent
Application No. 93 305 363.9, consists of a tobacco column
wrapped in a conventional cigarette wrapper. At one end, a
hollow cylindrical extension is provided by a continuation of the
wrapper beyond the tobacco column. The extension is treated to
make it unsmokable. The rod cannot be smoked, since drawing on
the extension will cause it to collapse, and the unsmokeable 
nature of the extension makes it impossible to light that end and
smoke the rod. The smoker renders the rod smokable by inserting
a filter plug into the extension.DE-A-1 809 983 discloses the manufacture of a cigarette of
conventional appearance the filler of which is a bunched up sheet
of reconstituted tobacco.According to the invention there is provided a kit for making a
smoking article comprising: a hull comprising a hollow cylinder
of wrapping closed at one end by a filter; and separately,
reconstituted tobacco, characterised in that the reconstituted
tobacco comprises a plurality of sheets of reconstituted tobacco,
at least one of the sheets having a different tobacco composition
to others of the sheets, a principal dimension of each sheet of
reconstituted tobacco being substantially equal to the length of
the hollow cylinder.Preferably the sheets of smoking material are generally
rectangular, and have a width the same as the hollow length of
the hull.In order to make a smoking article, a smoker rolls a

A kit for making a smoking article comprising: a hull (10)
comprising a hollow cylinder (14) of wrapping closed at one end

by a filter; and separately, reconstituted tobacco, characterised
in that the reconstituted tobacco comprises a plurality of sheets

(12) of reconstituted tobacco, at least one of the sheets having
a different tobacco composition to others of the sheets, a

principal dimension of each sheet of reconstituted tobacco being
substantially equal to the length of the hollow cylinder.
A smoking article made from a kit according to claim 1.
A smoking article comprising a plurality of sheets of
reconstituted tobacco, at least one of the sheets having a

different tobacco composition to others of the sheets, rolled
into a cylinder inside a cylindrical wrapper (14), the

cylindrical wrapper being closed by a filter.
