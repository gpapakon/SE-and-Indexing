<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method for removing a liquid from a 
container (12) having a bowl (28) and a flange (30), the bowl holding the 

liquid and containing a hydrophilic ophthalmic lens, 
wherein there is provided a nozzle (16) with a central face and 

a shoulder around the periphery of the face. The shoulder 
has a sealing means (22) which is sized to fit on the flange of 

the container, where it forms a sealed volume above the 
container bowl, this volume including the volume of the 

bowl itself. The central face has through it at least one 
fluid entrance passage (24) and at least one fluid exit passage (26) 

arranged so that the flow is distributed substantially 
symmetric about the center axis of the lens so that when 

the purging fluid is introduced into the sealed volume, 
there is no migration of the lens. There is connected to 

the entrance passage a source of purging fluid that has a 
pressure and flow sufficient to remove substantially all 

the liquid through the exit passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
removing processing liquid from a lens-bearing container 
during manufacture of molded ophthalmic lenses. This 
invention is suited to molded ophthalmic lenses such as 
hydrogel contact lenses, although the method is also 
suitable for other hydrophilic, high-precision ophthalmic 
lenses such as intraocular lenses. In particular, this 
method and apparatus are directed to the removal of 
deionized water from an ophthalmic lens package after lens 
inspection, and immediately prior to saline dosing and 
package sealing. As the ophthalmic lens industry has grown, and in 
particular the industry related to supplying contact 
lenses that are provided for periodic frequent 
replacement, the number of lenses that need to be produced 
has increased dramatically. This has required 
manufacturers to strive for methods and apparatus that can 
be adapted to automated practices and perform with 
consistency. Similarly, the promise of easier insertion of a 
folded or rolled intraocular lenses through a smaller 
incision has increased the interest in soft intraocular 
lenses for patients undergoing cataract removal and lens 
replacement. Soft ophthalmic lenses for placement on the cornea or 
within the eye, such as contact lenses or soft intraocular 
lenses, can be made by a variety of techniques.  
 
Ophthalmic lenses can be made by spin casting a monomer 
material in a rotating mold then polymerizing the material 
so shaped. Another method used to manufacture both 
contact lenses and intraocular lenses is precision lathing 
of a piece of material which is then polished and used as 
a lens. Recently the molding of soft contact lenses and soft 
intraocular lenses has come into favor. This technique 
has the advantages of repeatability and speed that 
compares favorably with the prior methods of manufacturing 
lenses, such as by forming a monomer or monomer mixture in 
a mold such as one made from polystyrene or polypropylene. Techniques for successfully molding such lenses can 
be found in U.S. Patents 4,495,313 and 4,640,489 to Larsen 
and 4,889,664; 4,680,336 and 5,039,459 to Larsen et.al. 
These patents specifically described the use of a diluent, 
a material which substitutes for water during the molding 
process, and which is replaced with water after the 
molding has been completed. The advantage of this 
technique is that the optical properties, size and shape 
of the lens thus made does not change as radically as with 
methods that do not utilize such

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for removal of a liquid from a 
container (12) having a bowl portion (28) said bowl 

portion (28) containing said liquid and containing a 
hydrophillic ophthalmic lens, said apparatus 

comprising: a nozzle (16) having a central face (18) 
and a shoulder (20) about the circumferential 

periphery of said central face (18), said central face 
(18) having therethrough at least one fluid entrance 

passage (24) and at least one fluid exit passage (26), 
characterised in that: said shoulder (20) contains a 

sealing means (22), said shoulder/sealing means 
combination being sized to fit said sealing means (22) 

on said container (12) and to position said central 
face (18) above the lens within said bowl portion 

(28); a source of purging fluid is connected to said 
entrance passage (24) and has a pressure and flow 

sufficient to remove substantially all of said liquid; 
and said passages (24, 26) of said nozzle face (18) 

are located in an arrangement so as to distribute the 
flow of said purging fluid and liquid in a manner so 

as to retain the lens in the bowl (28). 
The apparatus (10) of claim 1 wherein there is a 
single entrance passage (24) located along the central 

cylindrical axis of said nozzle (16) and there are a 
plurality of exit passages (26) between said entrance 

passage (24) and said shoulder (20). 
The apparatus (10) of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said 
nozzle (16) further comprises a bias means (37) for 

supplying a separation force between the apparatus 
(10) and the package (12). 
The apparatus (10) of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein 
said purging fluid is a gas. 
The apparatus (10) of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein  
 

said purging fluid is saline solution. 
A method of removing a liquid from a container (12) 
having a bowl portion (28), said bowl portion (28) 

containing said liquid and containing a hydrophillic 
ophthalmic lens, said method comprising: 


forming a sealed volume above said container bowl 
(28), said volume comprising the volume of the bowl 

(28) itself, introducing purging fluid through at 
least one entrance passage (24) into said sealed 

volume and removing substantially all of said purging 
fluid and liquid from said sealed volume through at 

least one exit passage, characterised in that the 
purging fluid is introduced in such a manner that 

there is no migration of the lens, said fluid being 
introduced at a pressure and with a flow sufficient 

to remove substantially all of said liquid. 
The method of claim 6 wherein the purging fluid is 
introduced along the central axis of the lens, and 

the purging fluid and liquid are removed at a location 
between the central axis of said lens and the 

periphery of said sealed volume. 
The method of claim 6 or claim 7 wherein said 
introduction of purging fluid is sufficiently rapid 

to cause pressurisation of said sealed volume. 
The method of any one of claims 6 to 8 wherein said 
forming of a sealed volume seals the liquid in the
