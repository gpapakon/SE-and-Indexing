<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable
silicone composition which is suitable for a silicone
coating, pressure-sensitive adhesive or a hot melt pressure-sensitive
adhesive. This composition is based upon an
aminoalkoxy-functional diorganopolysiloxane polymer and
cures upon exposure to ambient moisture.Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives (hereinafter
PSAs) typically contain at least two primary components,
namely a linear siloxane polymer and a tackifier resin
comprising triorganosiloxane (M) units (i.e., R3SiO1/2
units, in which R denotes a monovalent organic group) and
silicate (Q) units (i.e., SiO4/2 units). In addition,
silicone PSA compositions are generally provided with some
crosslinking means (e.g., peroxide or hydrosilation cure
systems) in order to optimize various properties of the
final adhesive product. In view of the high viscosity
imparted by the polymer component, these PSA compositions
are typically dispersed in an organic solvent for ease of
application. Some of these PSAs contain reactive groups
which allow the compositions to be cured by exposure to
moisture. When the proportions of the above described resin
and polymer and other parameters are adjusted, similar
combinations can be formulated into coating compositions.
Under certain other conditions, hot melt PSAs can be
obtained. The following citations are illustrative of the
prior art: US-A 4,865,920; US-A 5,162,410; EP 0 529 841 A1;
JP-A 4/81,487; US-A 5,091,484 and US-A 4,143,088.While the above systems rely upon alkoxy-functional
groups for their cure by ambient moisture, they 
also require an organometallic catalyst in order to attain a
reasonable cure rate. The addition of such catalysts may
not be desirable in certain applications since these
compounds contribute to side reactions. Such reactions
reduce shelf life of the uncured adhesive and contribute to
network bond rearrangement and reversion in the cured
product. These side reactions can lead to the deterioration
of physical properties. Furthermore, with the current
emphasis on the control of volatile organic compound (VOC)
emissions, the use of conventional PSAs and solvent-borne
coatings is losing favor. As a consequence, there is an
ever growing need for systems which contain little or no
solvent. Additionally, many applications require that an
essentially instant bond be formed between parts so that the
parts can be transported or otherwise manipulated without
waiting for a solvent to evaporate or the composition to
cure. This characteristic is defined herein as
