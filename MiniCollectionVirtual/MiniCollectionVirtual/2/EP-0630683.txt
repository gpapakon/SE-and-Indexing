<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for cooling hot gas in a reactor 
(10) in which the lower section of the reactor is provided 

with an inlet (16) for hot gas and a chamber (12) 
encompassing a bubbling fluidized bed (14), the middle 

section is provided with a riser (22), and the upper 
section with a gas outlet (30), and the reactor has heat 

transfer surfaces (24, 44, 46) for recovering heat from 
solid particles. The riser is defined by vertical walls 

(24), which are arranged above the bubbling fluidized bed 
so that they divide the fluidized bed into an outer (12') 

and inner (12'') part. From the inner part (12'') of the 
fluidized bed (14) solid particles are supplied to the 

hot inlet gas for cooling thereof. The gas containing 
solid particles is conveyed through the riser (22) into 

the upper section of the reactor, where solid particles 
are separated from the gas in a particle separator (28) 

and returned to the fluidized bed into the outer part 
(12') thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for cooling or utilizing hot gas in a reactor in which
the lower section of the reactor is provided with a hot
gas inlet and a chamber encompassing a fluidized bed, the
middle section is provided with a riser, and the upper
section with a gas outlet, and the reactor has heat
transfer surfaces for recovering heat form solid particles.
The invention especially relates to a method, in
which hot gas is introduced through the inlet into the
lower section of the reactor, and solid particles from
the bubbling fluidized bed are fed to the inlet gas for
cooling thereof, solid particles are separated from the
cooled gas and returned to the fluidized bed, heat is
recovered from the separated solid particles, and the
cooled gas is discharged through the gas outlet.Fluid bed reactors are well applicable to cooling of hot
gases containing molten and/or vaporized components and/or
tar-like particles. Gas coolers are suited to, e.g.,
cooling of exhaust gases from industrial plants and dry
purification of gases containing dust and tar and other
condensing components, which gases have resulted from
partial oxidation of biomass, peat or coal. The hot gases
introduced into the reactor are efficiently cooled by
mixing solid particles therewith, such solid particles
having been cooled in the reactor earlier.Finnish patent 64997 teaches cooling of hot gases in
circulating fluidized bed reactors. Here hot gases are
fed as fluidizing gas into the mixing chamber of the
reactor, where the gases cool efficiently as they come
into contact with a large amount of solid particles,
i.e., bed material. Solid particles are carried by the 
gas flow through the riser into the upper section of the
reactor, where they are separated and then returned to
the fluidized bed in the mixing chamber. In the riser,
the gas flow conveying solid particles is cooled by heat
transfer surfaces.A drawback of the method described above is, however,
that the hot gases to be cooled have to fluidize a large
amount of solid particles, whereby the power requirement
is high. On the other hand, a sudden interruption in the
power supply may result in the entire bed flowing through
the inlet and further out of the reactor.Finnish patent application 913416 (DE-A-4 023 060 defining the method and apparatus of the preambles
of claims 1 and 10) also teaches cooling of
hot process gas in a stationary fluidization, i.e., a so-called
bubbling fluidized bed. Here the hot gas flowing
into the reactor is supplied with
