<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel compounds having activity as histamine H3-receptor antagonists. In a preferred aspect, the compounds of the invention exhibit ready penetration of the blood-brain-barrier and reduced toxicity. The novel compounds of the invention include compounds of the formula (I) wherein D is CH2 or CH2-CH2, Z represents S or O, preferably O, x is 0 or 1, n is an integer from 0 to 6, R1 represents preferably hydrogen, or a hydrolysable group, but can be a lower alkyl or aryl group, and R2 represents a linear chain, branched chain or carbocyclic group or aryl group of up to about 20 carbon atoms, and salts thereof. If R2 is tert-butyl, cyclohexyl, or dicyclohexylmethyl, x or n must not be 0. If R2 is adamantane, the sum of x and n must be greater than 1. The various alkyl or aryl groups can have functional group substituents. Illustrative of the compounds of the invention is the molecule 4-(1-cyclohexylvaleryol-4-piperidyl)-1H-imidazole.

-|[4 ' -PIPERIDINYL OR 3 ' -PIRR0LIDINYLJ SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZOLES AS H3-RECEPT0R ANTAGONISTS AND THERAPEUTIC USES THEREOFThe present application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/862 , 657 , filed April 1, 1992 , which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .1. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel compounds having potent activity as histamine H3-receptor ("H3") 0 antagonists, and methods of using such compounds .2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dementias tend to be characterized by cognitive disorders and often by depression. A particularly15 devastating dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD) . AD affects more than 30% of humans over 80 years of age, and as such, represents one of the most important health problems in developed countries (Evans et al., J.A.tf .A. 262; 2551-2556 (1989) ; Katzman and Saitoh, 0 FASEB J. 280: 278-286 (1991)). This neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology is clinically characterized by gradual impairment of cognitive function. The large buildup of intracytoplasmic neurofibrillary tangles and neurite plagues observed 5 histopathologically in AD plausibly leads to degeneration of affected nerve cells. At least one study showed decreases in histamine and histidine levels in frontal, temporal and occipital cortices and in the caudate nucleus of brains from AD patients 0 examined post mortem (Mazurkiewics and sonwah, Can . J. Physiol . Pharmacol . , 62:75-78 (1989)).Histamine is a chemical messenger involved in various complex biological actions. It is widely distributed in the plant and animal kingdoms. In 5 mammals, including man, it occurs mainly in an inactive bound form in most body tissues. When 

released, histamine interacts with specific macromolecular receptors on the cell surface or within a target cell to elicit changes in many different bodily functions. Histamine (4(2-aminoethyl) imidazole) is a base. Its chemical structure is:Histamine receptor pharmacology has revealed three subtypes of receptors which mediate (or are associated with) the activity of histamine. These receptors are most commonly referred to as Hlf H2, and H3. The most recently discovered of these receptors is the H3 histamine receptor. Early studies suggested the presence of another histamine receptor when it was demonstrated that histamine inhibits its own synthesis and release in brain slices by a negative feedback process operating at the level of histaminergic nerve- endings (see, for example, Arrang, J.M. et al. Nature 302:832-837
