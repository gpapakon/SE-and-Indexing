<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 07/933,492,
filed August 21, 1992.The invention relates to recombinant vector systems and more specifically to
the use of these systems for production of cationic peptides.In 1981, the self-promoted uptake hypothesis was first proposed to explain the
mechanism of action of polycationic antibiotics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
According to this hypothesis, polycations interact with sites on the outer
membranes of Gram-negative bacteria at which divalent cations cross-bridge
adjacent lipopolysaccharide molecules. Due to their higher affinity for these
sites, polycations displace the divalent cations and, since the polycations are
bulkier than the divalent cations, cause structural perturbations in the outer
membrane. These perturbations result in increased outer membrane
permeability to compounds such as the Î²-lactam antibiotic nitrocefin, the
eukaryotic non-specific defense protein lysozyme and to hydrophobic
substances. By analogy, molecules accessing this pathway are proposed to
promote their own uptake.It has been clearly demonstrated that the outer membranes of Gram-negative
bacteria are semipermeable molecular "sieves" which restrict access of
antibiotics and host defense molecules to their targets within the bacterial cell.
Thus, cations and polycations which access the self-promoted uptake system
are, by virtue of their ability to interact with and break down the outer 
membrane permeability barrier, capable of increasing the susceptibility of
Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and host defense molecules.
Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad range of such compounds
could overcome the permeability barrier and coined the name "permeabilizers"
to describe them (Hancock and Wong, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 26:48.
1984). While self-promoted uptake and permeabilizers were first described for
P. aeruginosa, they have now been described for a variety of Gram-negative
bacteria.Over the past decade, non-specific defense molecules have been described
in many animals, including insects and humans. One subset of these
molecules have in common the following features: (a) they are small peptides,
usually 15-35 amino acids in length, (b) they contain 4 or more positively
charged amino acid residues, either lysines or arginines, and (c) they are found
in high abundance in the organisms from which they derive. Several of these
molecules have been isolated, amino acid sequenced and described in the
patent literature (e.g.,
