<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a reference diode formed in an insulated N-type well (10). An avalanche diode includes a deep P-type region (20) with high doping level, under and extending from which is formed a buried N-type layer (3), a first P-type deep diffusion (15) joining a central part of the said deep region, a second P-type deep diffusion (21) joining the periphery of the said deep region, a N-type surface region (16) with high doping level forming an avalanche junction with the surface of the first deep diffusion. At least one other structure (31-34, 41-44) is provided, identical to that of the said avalanche diode except for the N-type surface region, forming a resistor between its first and second electrodes (33, 34; 43, 44).

(10) of a first conductivity type epitaxial layer (2) 

that coats a substrate (1) of the second conductivity 
type, comprising: 


an avalanche diode including:

that the insulation of the well is ensured by the 

contact of a base (13) of the second conductivity type, 
formed in the substrate, with a third deep diffused 

region (12) of the second conductivity type extending 
from the external surface of the epitaxial layer, and 

wherein said deep region (20) is of the same nature as 
said base (13). 
A reference voltage circuit, characterized in 
that it includes between a high supply source and 

ground:
