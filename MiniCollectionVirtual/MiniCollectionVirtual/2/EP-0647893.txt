<ABSTRACT>
A CNC apparatus capable of transferring data from an external device with ease at a high speed. In a 
numerical controller (1), a hard disk device (HDD) (3) is incorporated. The hard disk device (3) is connected to a 

personal computer (2) through an interface (4). The interface (4) is a parallel communication interface such as SCSI. 
In the personal computer (2), data on the numerical controller (1) are prepared. The data thus prepared are transferred 

to the hard disk device (3) in the numerical controller (1) through the interface (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transfer 
system for a computer numerical control apparatus (CNC) for 
transferring data from an external device to the CNC, and 
more particular to a data transfer system for a CNC for 
transferring data prepared using a personal computer or the 
like. A typical method for allowing a computer numerical 
control apparatus (CNC) to read in data from an external 
device generally uses a floppy disk. One problem 
associated with this method is that a lot of time is 
required for reading data. Conventionally, a system has been popular in which 
an external device 42 such as a personal computer or the 
like and a CNC 41 are directly connected via an interface 
43 such as an RS 232C or the like as shown in FIG. 6(A). 
According to this system, data are supplied in a serial 
transfer fashion, so that data transfer rate is low. In 
addition, in order to transfer data, the same communication 
software must be provided respectively in the CNC 41 and 
the external device 42, and system setting is difficult.  Accordingly, more recently, another system has 
been proposed which transfers data from the external device 
42 to a hard disk drive (HDD) 44 via an interface 45, then 
transfers the data from the HDD 44 to the CNC 41 via an 
interface 46. The interfaces 45 and 46 belong to a kind of 
parallel communication interfaces like a small computer 
system interface (SCSI). Owing to this system, data can be 
transferred at higher rate without using a special 
software. Although this system would basically solve the 
abovementioned problem, it has a disadvantage that working 
efficiency is low, because it needs two interfaces for one 
data transfer. In view of the above problem, it is an object of 
the present invention to provide a data transfer system for 
a CNC by which data can be transferred more easily at 
higher rate than those of the prior art. To achieve the above object, there is provided in 
accordance with the present invention a data transfer 
system for a CNC for transferring data from an external 
device to the CNC, wherein a hard disk drive which is 
electrically connectable to both the CNC and the external 
device is incorporated in the CNC. As the hard disk drive which can be electrically 
connected to both the CNC and external device is  
 
incorporated in the CNC according to the present invention, 
data can be easily transferred only by connecting between 
the CNC and the external device. Further, as the CNC and the external device can 
independently
