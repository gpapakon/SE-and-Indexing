<ABSTRACT>
Image data conversion processor converting a raster format 
of composed image data comprising line-work and picture data into 

a format of engraving pixel data for realizing a staggered-row 
screen of gravure printing cells, image density weighted for 

high-fidelity reproduction of tone value and line sharpness of an 
originally scanned image pattern. The dual-valued line-work 

pixels are in high resolution relative to the picture data 
pixels and are converted into multiple-valued line-work 

equivalent pixels in a picture-raster equivalent format. The 
multiple-valued line-work data and the picture data are assembled 

according to layout data operator controlled through a CRT to 
form the composed image data for conversion. A format converter 

in the processor maps the converted multiple-valued line-work 
equivalent pixels in the picture-raster equivalent format into 

gravure engraving pixels each corresponding to an engraved 
gravure cell of the stagger-format printing screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processing of printing
data, scanned in a screen of image points from an image pattern
which can include both line work and continuous tone portions and
computer stored as pixel data in a raster or rasters
corresponding to the scanning screen, making the data suitable
for use in electromechanical engraving of printing forms with a
screen of printing cells arranged in nested or staggered rows
different from the screen arrangement of the pixel data raster(s)
derived from the scanned image. More particularly, the invention
relates to a gravure data processor by which stored image pixel
data comprising tonal density dual-value line work pixels in a
higher line-concentration raster, and multiple tone-value picture
pixel data in a lower line-concentration raster, are converted
into a format of engraving pixel data for realizing a nested- or
staggered-row screen of gravure printing cells, image density
weighted for high-fidelity reproduction of tone value and line
sharpness of the originally scanned image pattern.Half-tone scanning of a printing subject will produce image
information corresponding to a screen of scanned image pattern 
points which can be digitalized and stored as pixel data. The
image density of the pixels (corresponding to the point tone
values of the scanned image) and the format in which the pixel
data are arranged will depend upon the type of printing process
for which the pixel data is to be used. For offset printing, the
image pattern pixel data corresponding to the printing screen of
dots is mapped in rectangular rasters of pixels representing a
relatively high concentration of printing dots, from between 300
to 2,000 dpi (dots/in where "in" means inch, taking into account that 1 inch = 2,54 cm), for example {depending upon the image
resolution}; for character or line work, the dual-valued pixel
data {"0" or "1", i.e., no tone value, or full printing tone
value} should be in a raster of higher pixel concentration than
that of the pixel raster for printing the continuous tone
(picture) portions of the subject image pattern.In contrast, in gravure printing, the cells electromechanically
engraved into a printing form are arranged in lines of
lower density, for example, 150 to 200 lines/in, compared with
the dots/in density in offset printing, wherein each cell can be
cut in a range of sizes (depths) corresponding to multiple tone-value
gradations (256 in the case of 8-bit tone value
resolution). If each gravure cell is to correspond to pixel data
from the
