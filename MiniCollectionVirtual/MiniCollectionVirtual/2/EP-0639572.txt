<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a certain kind of
oxazoline derivative, and more detailedly to 2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-oxazoline
represented by the following formula (I)

, and a miticide containing it.Heretofore, several reports have been made
about 2,4-diphenyl-2-oxazoline compounds. See, for
example, Tetrahedron Letters, 22 (45), 4471-4474 (1981);
Chemical Abstracts, 98, 160087k (1983); and J. Org.
Chem., 52, 2523-2530 (1987), etc.Japanese Patent Official Announcement No.
501962/1982 (= PCT International Publication No. WO
82/02046) discloses Δ2-N-heterocyclic compounds, for
example 2,4-diphenyl-2-oxa- or -thia-zoline derivatives
and 2-phenyl-4-benzyl-2-oxa- or -thia-zoline derivatives,
useful as intermediates for preparation of effective
ingredients of pharmaceuticals and/or as compounds
having, as they are, biological actions, e.g. as an
antidiabetic drug.However, the above-mentioned literatures do not
mention at all activities of the compounds disclosed
therein on pests noxious to agrohorticultural crops, for 
example insects, mites, etc.On the other hand, the present inventors found
that a series of 2,4-diphenyl-2-oxa- or -thia-zoline
derivatives represented by the following general formula
(A)

   wherein,
X1 and X2 are the same or different, and each
denote a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a
lower alkoxy group, a halogen atom, a trifluoromethyl
group or a trifluoromethoxy group;Y1 and Y2 are the same or different, and each
denote a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a
lower alkoxy group, a lower alkylthio group, a
cyano group, a nitro group, a halogen atom or a
trifluoromethyl group;Z denotes an oxygen or sulfur atom; and n is 0
or 1;
provided that
(1) Y1 and Y2 are not simultaneously hydrogen
atoms,(2) when n is 0 and both X1 and X2 are hydrogen
atoms, or when n is 1, and X1 and X2 are
the same or different and each are a hydrogen
atom, a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom or a
bromine atom, Y1 and Y2 are the same or different,
and each denote a lower alkyl group, a
lower alkoxy group, a lower alkylthio group, a
cyano group, an iodine atom or a trifluoromethyl
group, and(3) X1 or X2 and Y1 or Y2 cannot denote alkyl
groups having 4 to 6 carbon atoms at the 2- or
6-position of the benzene ring, 
have excellent insecticidal and miticidal activities
against harmful insects which are parasitic on useful
plants, and proposed them (see Japanese Laid-Open patent
Publication No. 85268/1990 = US Patent No. 4,977,171 and
EP 345775A1).JP,A, 3-232867 and EP,A, 432 661 disclose
