<ABSTRACT>
In order to control an energy-saving state of a cathode screen (M) by a control device (PC) connected thereto via a standard interface (SS) for its operation without the individual devices' being restricted to use in an arrangement with instruments tuned to one another relatively to the control of the energy-saving state, there are means for transmission, independent of the function of the standard interface (SS), of information (SB) controlling the energy-saving state of the cathode screen (M) in coded form between the control device and the cathode screen (PC and M).

Electric functional unit (PC) and cathode-ray 
tube visual display unit (M) having respective connection 

points for connection lines of a standard interface (SS) 
for supplying the cathode-ray tube visual display unit 

with signals appropriate for its basic function coming 
from the electric functional unit, and having matched 

means (VC, PSB-DC) for the transmission of a message on 
the part of the electric functional unit to the cathode-ray 

tube visual display unit for controlling the cathode-ray 
tube visual display unit into an energy-saving state, 

characterized in that the said means are assigned to the 
standard interface and comprise device elements for 

generation, transmission and evaluation of the message, 
in that the device elements are arranged for generation 

of the message in the electric functional unit and for 
evaluation of the message in the cathode-ray tube visual 

display unit, and in that the device elements are 
operated in such a mannner that for setting the cathode-ray 

tube visual display unit into a predetermined energy-saving 
state a coded message is generated and evaluated, 

resulting in the cathode-ray tube visual display unit 
initially adopting a first predetermined energy-saving 

state and at a later time adopting at least a second 
predetermined energy-saving state. 
Electric functional unit and cathode-ray tube 
visual display unit according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that the electric functional unit (PC) has a device 
for switching off the function of the transmission of the 

message (PSB) controlling the energy-saving state of the 
cathode-ray tube visual display unit (M).  

 
Electric functional unit and cathode-ray tube 
visual display unit according to Claim 2, characterized 

in that the device for switching off the function of the 
transmission of the message (PSB) controlling the energy-saving 

state of the cathode-ray tube visual display unit 
(M) can be operated freely selectively by a user.
