<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for interchangeably attaching an implement to the front end of an arm 3 of an excavator. The implement is provided with a first, transversely running rod 12 as well as with a first locking element. The exchange device 1 is provided with a first recess 7, by means of which the exchange device 1 can be slipped onto the first rod 12, as well as with a second, displaceable locking element which can be brought into engagement with the first locking element and as a result the implement is held by positive locking on the exchange device 1. In order to provide a technically simple and universally usable device for interchangeably attaching an implement to the front part of an arm of an excavator, it is proposed with the invention that the first locking element of the implement be a second rod 12' parallel to the first rod 12, that the exchange device 1 be capable of being slipped onto the second rod 12', and that the second, displaceable locking element block the escape of the second rod 12' from the second recess 7' in a positive-locking manner in the locking state.

Device for interchangeable fixing of a tool-like 
attachment to the front end of an excavator arm (3) of 

an excavator, the attachment having two transverse rods 
(12) parallel to each other, the interchange device (1) 

having a first pair of recesses (7) by means of which 
the interchange device (1) can be pushed onto the first 

rod (12), and a second pair of recesses (7') by means of 
which the interchange device (1) can be pushed onto the 

second rod (12'), and finally two sliding locking 
elements which in their locked state tightly block the 

emergence of the second rod (12') from the second pair 
of recesses (7'),
 
characterised in that
 
to slide the two locking elements, an omega-shaped 

bracket (11) is provided which is attached by its 
outward-pointing legs to each locking element. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
bracket (11) consists of two Z-shaped bracket elements 

(11', 11'') which are fastened together by one leg 
essentially at a point in the area of the centre axis of 

the device and which are attached by the other leg to 
the respective locking element. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that a double acting cylinder/piston 

unit (9) is provided for the movement. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the two recess pairs (7, 7') are 

aligned to each other such that the second recess pair 
(7') can be pushed onto the second rod (12') when the 

first recess pair (7) has first been pushed onto the 
first rod (12) and, after a swivel movement, held there 

by an interference fit.  
 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the first pair of recesses (7) are 

sufficiently long that attachments with rods at 
different spacings (12, 12') can be attached with the 

same interchange device (1). 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the locking elements are wedges 

(8). 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that a spring (10) is also provided 

which forces the locking elements into their locking 
position. 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the attachment can be fastened 

with its two rods (12, 12') on either side of the 
interchange device (1). 
Device according to any of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the interchange device (1) 

consists of an upper part (4') for the coupling on the 
excavator arm (3) and a lower part (4") for the 

recesses (7, 7') and the sliding locking element.
