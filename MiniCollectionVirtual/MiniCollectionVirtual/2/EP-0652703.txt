<DESCRIPTION>
 "Methods for Positive Immunoselection of Stem Cells"The invention relates to i "proved methods for positive immunoselection of target cells from a . -lerogeneous cell composition. The invention also relates to immunological kit$ for effecting said immunoselection of cells. The invention also relates to improved methods for assaying the purity of the immunoselected cells using indicator cells, which may be autologous or heterologous, as well as methods for subjecting the recovered cells to further immunoselection procedures.The invention in particular relates to improved methods for the positive immunoselection of stem and progenitor cells, and a specific immunological reagent (monoclonal antibody) for effecting said positive immunoselection of stem and progenitor cells. The invention also relates to improved methods for assaying the purity of said immunopurified stem and progenitor cells using indicator cells (e.g., autologous) as well as methods for subjecting the immunoselected cells to further immunoselection. Finally, the invention relates to purified stem and progenitor cells resulting from these methods, and methods of using these purified stem cells diagnostically and therapeutically. 

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe use of immunoselection for the specific recovery of desired moieties from heterogeneous compositions is conventional in the art. Essentially immunoselection techniques broadly embrace the isolation of a desired moiety from a heterogeneous composition on the basis of its specific reactivity with its immunological binding partner. Essentially, these techniques exploit the specific reactivity of the desired moiety contained in a heterogeneous system, e.g., a particular antigen, bacteria, virus, cell, hapten, antibody, etc. with its immunological counterpart, an immunological reagent which is generally an antibody, antibody-like molecule, or an antigen so as to effect the desired separation.Immunoselection techniques have in particular been utilized for the separation of desired cells from heterogeneous compositions comprising these cells. This application of immunoselection for the purification of specific cell types has been the focus of much recent research given the significant potential applications of purified cell compositions as diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as for biomedical research.For example, the selective recovery of specific highly purified cell types will better enable biological researchers to study the differentiation of these specific cell types, will
