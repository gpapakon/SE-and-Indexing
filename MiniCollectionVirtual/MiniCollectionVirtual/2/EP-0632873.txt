<ABSTRACT>
A wastewater disposal system for a building which recycles grey wastewater for irrigation. The system has interconnected wastewater pipes (20-29) containing two separate passageways (20a, 20b), one for reusable grey water and the other for sewer water, and three different types of T-fittings (30, 40, 50, 60) are used with the two passageway wastewater pipes (20-29), each T-fitting (30, 40, 50, 60) designed to interconnect two axially aligned wastewater pipes and having an offset opening to one of the wastewater passageways in the fitting, one type of T-fitting (30) designed to discharge sewer water into the sewer water passageway in the fitting, the second type (40) designed to discharge grey water into the grey water passageway (20a) of the fitting, and the third type (50, 60) designed to vent to atmosphere both passageways (20a, 20b) in the fitting. A fourth T-fitting (70) is designed to divert reusable grey water into a storage tank and channel sewer water into a sewer system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionWATER CONSERVING WASTE WATER DISPOSAL SYSTEM Technical FieldThe invention lies in the field of systems for the disposal of waste waters generated within a building; and, more particularly, to a waste water disposal system which saves and recycles for further use a portion of the building's waste water, thus conserving a sizable portion of the water usually used in the operation and maintenance of the building.Background ArtMost buildings, whether residential or commercial, contain a number of appliances which require fresh water and generate waste water which has to be drained off and disposed of in an approved and sanitary manner. Some appliances such as toilets and garbage disposals generate waste waters which must be drained off and disposed of in a public sewer or a septic system.However, other appliances such as bathtubs, shower stalls, bathroom and kitchen sinks, and clothes washers generate waste waters commonly called grey water containing only small amounts of soap or detergent residues which can be safely reused to irrigate lawns and plants surrounding the building. Recycling of the grey water generated in the building would save the use of considerable fresh water normally used in the irrigation of the building's lawns and plants.Disclosure of InventionI have invented a waste water disposal system which permits the recapture and storage for irrigation 

or other reuse of the grey waste water generated in a building.My water conserving waste water disposal system in operation drains the waste waters from all the appliances in the building into one common disposal line, but that line contains two parallel but separate passageways, one for the reusable grey water destined to be stored for reuse and the other passageway for the contaminated sewer water to be emptied into a public sewer line or a septic system.In order to drain the waste water classified as reusable grey water into the grey water passageway of the common disposal line and also to drain the contaminated sewer water into the other passageway, I have developed two unique T-fittings which permit the discharge of waste water from an appliance into the proper passageway without interference with the flow of previously discharged waste water through the two passageways in the common line. In order to maintain a continuous flow of waste water through the line, it is desirable to vent to the atmosphere both of the passageways in the line. To accomplish this, I have developed a third T-fitting which vents both passageways

Claims
1. A waste water fitting for use in a waste water piping system which includes a plurality of elongated waste water pipes each having two parallel but separate passageways within the pipe, one passageway for the flow of reusable grey water and the other passageway for the flow of sewer water, the water in both passageways of each elongated waste water pipe flowing in the same direction, said fitting designed to interconnect the ends of two axially aligned elongated waste water pipes so as to keep the reusable grey water separate from the sewer water flowing through the fitting, and having a pair of offset arms each containing an opening into only one of two waste water passageways in the fitting so as to vent to the atmosphere the two passageways in the fitting.
2. A waste water fitting for use in a waste water piping system which includes a plurality of elongated waste water pipes each having two parallel but separate passageways within the pipe, one passageway for the flow of reusable grey water and the other passageway for the flow of sewer water, the water in both passageways of each elongated waste water pipe flowing in the same direction, said fitting designed to connect two axially aligned elongated waste water pipes and divert all of the usable grey water flowing into said fitting from the waste water pipe conveying separate flows of grey water and sewer water and divert all the grey water into a single passageway pipe to be delivered to a storage tank and to deliver all of the sewer water 


flowing from said waste water fitting into a public sewer line or septic system.
