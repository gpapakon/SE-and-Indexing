<DESCRIPTION>
 HERMAPHRODITIC ENDOSCOPIC CLAW EXTRACTORSThis is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial Nos. 07/680,392 and 07/780,014 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention broadly relates to claw extractor surgical instruments. More particularly, the invention relates to disposable endoscopic surgical claw extractors.The endoscopy and laparoscopy procedures have recently become widely practiced surgical procedures. The endoscopy and laparoscopy procedures involve incising through body walls (e.g., such as the abdominal wall) for examining, viewing and/or operating on the ovaries, uterus, gall bladder, bowels, appendix, etc. Typically, trocars are utilized for creating the incisions. Trocar tubes are left in place in the abdominal wall so that the endoscopic or laparoscopic surgical tools may be inserted through the tube. A camera or magnifying lens is often inserted through a relatively large diameter trocar tube (e.g. 10mm diameter) which for the laparoscopy procedure is generally located at the navel incision, while a cutter, dissector, extractor, or other surgical instrument is inserted through a typically smaller diameter trocar tube (e.g. 5 mm diameter) for purposes of manipulating and/or cutting the internal organ. Sometimes it is desirable to have several trocar tubes in place. at once in order to receive several surgical instruments. In this manner, organ or tissue may be grasped with one surgical instrument, and simultaneously may be cut or stitched with another surgical instrument; all under view of the surgeon via the camera in place in the navel trocar tube. 

 The endoscopic and laparoscopic tools of the prior art are primarily reusable stainless steel tools. Between each use of a stainless steel tool, the tool must be soaked, scrubbed, and disinfected. The usual procedure is then to dry the tool, wrap it, and put it in a steam autoclave. The tool is kept sterile until just prior to use when it is removed from the autoclave and unwrapped in the locale of the sterile field of use.While reusable endoscopic and laparoscopic tools have functioned well for their intended purpose, the process of sterilizing the tool is problematic. Small pieces of tissue or organ often become lodged in the end effectors, and much labor is required to ensure that complete sterility is obtained and maintained. In addition, over time, sharp instruments such as a scissors get dull and must be discarded. However, prior to use of a particular instrument,

perpendicular to said second longitudinal axes comprises a substantially solid form.
2. A surgical instrument according to claim 1, wherein: said substantially solid form is a substantially solid circle.
3. A surgical instrument according to claim 1, wherein: all said tooth-like elements of a gripping means are asymmetrical relative to the respective second longitudinal axis of said gripping means.
4. A surgical instrument according to claim 3, wherein: said at least one full tooth-like element comprises two complete tooth-like elements.
5. A surgical instrument according to claim 4, wherein: said second longitudinal axes of said elongate elements are parallel to said longitudinal axis of said hollow tube when said tooth-like elements are in said closed meshed position.
6. A surgical instrument according to claim 4, wherein: each said full tooth-like element is a first quadrilateral based pyramid having a base with two sides parallel to said second longitudinal axes and two sides perpendicular to said second longitudinal axes, and each said partial tooth-like element comprises a part of a second quadrilateral base pyramid identical to a part of said first quadrilateral based pyramid.
7. A surgical instrument according to claim 3, wherein: said side-by-side tooth-like elements comprise at least two substantially fully formed adjacent tooth-like elements and a partially formed tooth-like element in a row commencing 


 with a substantially fully formed tooth-like element and terminating in a partially formed tooth-like element.
8. A surgical instrument according to claim 3, wherein: each of said full tooth-like elements has a cross-section in a form of a triangle in a plane having first and second planar axes transverse to said second longitudinal axes, each said triangle having respective apexes, a distance being defined between apexes of adjacent said triangles, wherein a said apex of one of said triangles is transversely offset relative to said second longitudinal axis by one-quarter said apex-to-apex distance.
9. A surgical instrument according to claim 3, further comprising: clevis means for coupling said end effectors to said hollow tube, said clevis means having a proximal portion fixedly coupled to said hollow tube and a distal portion having at least one pin transverse said longitudinal axis of said hollow tube, wherein said respective base portions of said gripping means having respective first holes through which said at least one pin extends, at least one of said gripping means rotating around said at least one pin.
