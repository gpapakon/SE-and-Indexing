<ABSTRACT>
A cannula assembly (65) comprising an elongated tubular 
cannula body (72) having a tip section (72a) and a stylet (66) 

slidebly positioned within the cannula body such that one end 
of the stylet can extend beyond said tip section. The stylet 

includes a stop (66b) on its outer periphery which slides 
within the interior of the cannula body and limits withdrawal 

of the stylet when engaging an anti-backflow ring (80) in the 
end of the cannula body remote from the tip section (72a) to 

prevent leakage out of the cannula body.Preferably, the ring 
(80) can be forced out of the cannula body and 
a clamp (71) is 
present for limiting fluid flow into the cannula body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cannula assembly comprising 
an elongated tubular cannula body having a tip section and a 
stylet slidably positioned within the cannula body such that 
one end of the stylet can extend beyond said tip section. A cannula assembly of said type is known from US-A-4,511,356 
and is meant for use in operations such as lumbar 
disc puncture. Means are present to temporarily lock the 
stylet relative to the cannula body when the point of the 
stylet extends slightly beyond the tip section. After 
disengaging the stylet from the cannula body the stylet can be 
completely pulled out of the cannula body, e.g. to be replaced 
by another instrument. In recent years, there has been developed a femoral-to-femoral 
cardiopulmonary bypass system wherein it is not 
necessary to open the patient's chest. To accomplish this, it 
is necessary to employ large diameter cannulas and catheters 
in order to maximize blood flow. Cannulating a femoral artery 
is particularly difficult because of the pressure involved as 
well as the large flow through the artery. A cannula of the said last mentioned type is known 
from EP-A-0 232 074. Preparatory to insertion of this cannula, 
an incision has to be made being large enough to bring a flat 
shoulder in contact with the vascular conduit; all the more 
so, because there should be room for rotating the cannula 
around. In other words a stylet for smoothly penetrating a 
femoral artery is not present. The object of the invention is to provide an improved 
cannula which can be inserted into a femoral artery with a 
minimum of blood loss, in a minimum of time, and with a 
minimum of trauma and risk to the patient. This object is according to the invention achieved in 
that the stylet includes a stop on its outer periphery which 
slides within the interior of the cannula body and limits 
withdrawal of the stylet when engaging a seal in the end of 
the cannula body remote from the tip section to prevent 
leakage out of the cannula body. In use, the stylet is placed  
 
in the position with its one end extending beyond the tip 
section of the cannula body. After introducing the tip section 
into the femoral artery the seal, e.g. an anti-backflow ring 
positioned in the end of the cannula body remote from the tip 
section, prevents leakage through the annular passage between 
the stylet and the cannula body. When it is desirable to connect the cannula assembly 
to an extracorporeal circuit, it is preferred that the anti-backflow 
ring forms a temporary limit for

<CLAIMS>
A cannula assembly (65) comprising an elongated tubular 
cannula body (72) having a tip section (72a) and a stylet (66) 

slidably positioned within the cannula body such that one end 
of the stylet can extend beyond said tip section, 

characterized in that the stylet includes a stop (66b) on its 
outer periphery which slides within the interior of the 

cannula body and limits withdrawal of the stylet when engaging 
a seal (80) in the end of the cannula body remote from the tip 

section (72a) to prevent leakage out of the cannula body. 
A cannula assembly (65) according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said seal is an anti-backflow ring (80) 

positioned in the end of the cannula body (72) remote from the 
tip section (72a) and forming a temporary limit for said stop 

(66b) when said stylet (66) is in the process of being 
withdrawn from the cannula body. 
A cannula assembly (65) according to claim 2, 
characterized in that said stylet (66) is adapted to be fully 

withdrawn from said cannula body (72) including forcing said 
ring (80) out of the cannula body, the stylet and the cannula 

body having such lengths that when said stop (66b) engages the 
ring to temporary limiting withdrawal of the stylet, the 

cannula body extends beyond the one end of the stylet, means 
(71) being present at a location between the one end of the 

stylet engaging the ring and the tip of the cannula body for 
limiting fluid flow into the cannula body. 
A cannula assembly (65) according to claim 3, 
characterized in that said means for limiting fluid flow into 

said cannula body (72) include a clamp (71) for squeezing the 
cannula body. 
A cannula assembly (65) according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said end of the cannula body 

(72) remote from the tip section (72a) is provided with means 
for connecting said end to a pump.
