<ABSTRACT>
The method for verifying mailpieces comprises the 
creation of predetermined bit-mapped indicias which are 

printed on a mailpiece (12, 14, 16) and are changed in 
accordance with a predetermined pattern on each 

successive printing. The pattern will allow an animated 
sequence to occur as the mailpieces of a batch are 

flipped through. The animated sequence may be associated 
with a particular mailer. The animation during the 

flipping will allow postal officials to swiftly check to 
assure against some modes of fraudulent copying of postal 

indicias.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of printing indicia 
to enable verification of mailpieces, methods of 
producing a batch of mailpieces, and methods for 
verifying authenticity of a batch of mailpieces. The invention is applicable to postage metering 
systems and especially to postage metering systems which 
include bit-mapped printing of the meter indicias. Digital printing technology has made it possible to 
implement digital, i.e., bit map addressable, printing 
for the purpose of evidencing payment of postage by a 
postage-meter-like device. In order to distinguish such 
postage-meter-like devices from the typical postage meter 
which uses mechanical printing techniques, such devices 
will be named herein Postage Evidencing Devices or PED's. 
The computer driven printer can print the postal indicia 
in a desired location on the face of a mail piece. As 
used herein the postal indicia includes a Postal Revenue 
Block or PRB. The PRB typically contains data such as 
the postage value, a unique PED identification number, 
the date and in some applications the name of the place 
where the mail is originating. From the Post Office's point of view, it will be 
appreciated that the digital printing makes it fairly 
easy to counterfeit an indicia with the PRB since any 
suitable computer may be used to generate multiple 
images. It is known to prevent such counterfeiting by 
including certain information in the block in both plain 
text and cipher text. For example the postage amount, 
date and sequential piece count can be encrypted using 
either a secret or public key encryption algorithm and 
printed along with the plain text counterpart in the PRB. 
The value of the franking used in the encryption can be 
determined from the encryption to learn whether the value 
as printed on the mailpiece is correct. See, for  
 
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,757,537 and 4,775,246 to 
Edelmann et al. as well as U.S. Patent No. 4,649,266 to 
Eckert. It is also known to authenticate a mailpiece by 
including the address as a further part of the encryption 
as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,725,718 to Sansone et 
al. and U.S. Patent No. 4,743,747 to Fougere et al. The 
encrypted messages may be included in graphic form as 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,835,713 and 4,949,381 to 
Pastor. U.S. Patent No. 5,075,862 to Doeberl et al. 
discloses a metering system which includes changes in the 
indicia based on time of day of the printing. The Postal 
Authorities can riffle through a batch of mail to 
determine whether the time

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing indicia to enable verifying of 
mailpieces comprising the steps of creating a 

predetermined first indicia image, printing the first 
indicia image on a mailpiece, changing the first indicia 

image in a predetermined manner after the printing 
thereof, and thereafter sequentially printing and 

changing successive indicias on respective successive 
mailpieces franked by the s
ystem in accordance with a 
predetermined pattern. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said indicia 
images are bit-mapped. 
The method according to claim 2 wherein the step of 
creating the indicia image utilizes a bit map library and 

the changes are made by selecting new images from the 
library. 
A method according to any preceding claim wherein 
the step of creating the mailpiece image utilizes an 

algorithm for providing changes in the indicia. 
A method according to any preceding claim wherein 
the indicias are changed in a predetermined manner to 

produce a pattern such that a sequence of mailpieces in a 
batch will produce animation whenever the batch is 

flipped through. 
A method according to any preceding claim wherein 
each one of a plurality of predetermined patterns is 

associated with a respective selected user of a plurality 
of users. 
A method of producing a batch of mailpieces to 
enable verification of authenticity comprising the steps 

of creating for a user a predetermined bit-mapped first 
indicia image, printing the first indicia image on a 

mailpiece, changing the bit-mapped first indicia image in 
a predetermined manner after the printing thereof in 

accordance with a pattern provided to the user, and 
thereafter sequentially printing and changing successive 

indicias on respective successive mailpieces franked by 
the user in accordance with the predetermined pattern. 
A method of verifying authenticity of a batch of 
mailpieces produced according to claim 7 in which, upon 

receipt at a postal facility, the step of rapidly 
flipping through the batch of mailpieces in the 

sequentially printed order is performed to ensure that 
the corresponding pattern has been reproduced in the 

batch received from the user.
