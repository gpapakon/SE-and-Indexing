<ABSTRACT>
Films to be fed to a photographic printing apparatus 
are continuously fed one after another without the need of 

splicing the films together. The continuous film feed 
device has a case, a film core rotatably mounted in the 

case, and film presser arms each having a presser roll for 
pressing the films toward the center of the film core. The 

films are wound around the film core with their ends 
overlapped by putting the leading end of each film under 

the tail end of the preceding film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of continuously feeding
films according to the preamble of claim 1, and a continuous
film feeding device according to the preamble of claim 5.A method and a device of this type are disclosed in US-A-4 411
725. The known film feeding device discloses a magazine,
including a case and a film core supported therein. The case
is adapted to receive a plurality of films wound on the core,
one above the other, with the leading end of the film spliced
by means of adhesive tapes to the trailing end of the foregoing
film wound onto the core immediately before. The magazine is
then inserted into a printer, and the films are then fed to a
printing/exposure stage.In a further method used for feeding films to a printer, the
plurality of films are fed in separate rolls contained in
separate cartridges as received from the user.It is further known from US-A-4 847 635 to store a plurality of
large copy sheets wound on a supply roll in an interleaved or
overlapping array with the leading end of each sheet
overlapping the trailing end of the sheet immediately wound
before that sheet onto a roll. The roll is driven by a motor
until the outermost end of the uppermost sheet separates from
the roll, and is detected by sensing means. Then rotation of
the roll is stopped, and the outermost sheet is pulled from the
roll, releasing the outermost end of the next sheet, which then
will move down into a tangent arrangement to the roll for being
detected by the sensing means. Either of the above-described methods of continuously feeding films has a
problem in that the number of films which can be set is
limited in view of the mounting position and the like.It is not only-troublesome to mount cartridges each
accommodating one film or to splice a plurality of films
together and then separate them from one another. This
will also complicate the structure of the continuous film
feed device. It is an object of this invention to provide a method of,
and a device for continuously feeding a plurality of films
wound in a case with their ends overlapped without any of
the abovesaid problems.It is another object of this invention to provide a
continuous film feed device which can keep in position the
film leading end simply by closing the lid of the case,
whereby holding the film leading end in position reliably,
safely and at low cost.As means to solve the above objects, there is
provided, according to claim 1, a method of
continuously feeding films comprising the steps of winding 
a plurality of films one
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of continuously feeding films (f) out of a case (2), comprising
the steps of winding a plurality of films (f) one after

another around a film core (3) rotatably supported in the
case (2), and thereafter continuously feeding said films out of

said case by unwinding the films one after the other from said film core (3),
characterised in that
 said films (f) are wound on said
film core (3) with the end of the adjacent films (f)

overlapped by putting the leading end of each film under
the tail end of the preceding film wound immediately

before said each film while said overlapped film
ends are kept pressed toward the centre of said film core (3), and in that

said films (f) are continuously fed out of said case (2) one after the other
by applying a pulling force onto the leading

film (f) while the overlapping film ends remain
pressed.
The method of claim 1 including the step of applying said pulling force by means of a feed roller (10, 11) arranged so that
the pressure on the

overlapped ends of said pulled out film and said
preceding film wound immediately before onto said core

(3) is released, and said films are separated, when said tail end of said preceding film has
reached a feed roller (10,11).
The method of claim 2 wherein said feed roller (10) is
driven for applying a first pulling force to said film and is adapted

to idle when a second pulling force higher than said first pulling force is applied to said film
(f), and said driving of said feed roller (10) is

stopped when said feed roller (10) becomes idling. 
The method of claim 3 including the step of reactivating
driving of said feed roller (10) after a predetermined

interval.
A continuous film feeding device (1) comprising a case
(2) formed with an outlet (12), a film core (3)

rotatably supported in said case (2), and feeding means
(10,11) for feeding said film (f) out of said case (2),

said case (2) being adapted to receive a plurality of
films (f) wound onto said core (3) one after the other,
characterised in that
 said case (2) has a lid (7) which
can be opened, and includes a film pressure means

(4,5,8) provided around said film core (3) and
comprising rollers (4) for pressing against said film

core (3) the films (f) wound around said film core (3)
with the leading end of each film slid under the tail

end of the preceding film, and in that said feeding means
includes a feed roller (10) provided outside said case

(2) near said outlet (12) and a mating roller (11)
provided inside said case (2) and opposite to said feed

roller (10), said feed roller (10) and mating
roller (11) cooperatin
g with each other to pull said films (f) one after the other out of
said case (2).
The device (1) of claim 5 wherein said mating roller
(11) has a shaft urged by an elastic member (11b) so as

to be movable , wherein an opening (18) for receiving
said feed roller (10) is formed in said case (2) near

said mating roller (11), and wherein the inner surface
of said lid (7) at a portion between said feed roller

(10) and said mating roller (11) is formed as a presser
(19) for pressing the films (f) fed therebetween.
The device of claim 5 or 6 wherein the distance between
a roller (4) of said film pressure means and said feed 

roller (10) is shorter than said overlapped portion of
said film (f).
