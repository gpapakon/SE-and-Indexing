<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for 
measuring a relative positional deviation between a 

first pattern (U) and a second pattern (L), printed on an 
article such as a semiconductor wafer (14) at different times, 

the measurement being based on detection of 
interference of diffraction lights (fA1U,fB2U,fA1L,fB2L) 

from at least one of 
the first and second printed patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a measuring method 
and apparatus. More particularly, the invention is 
concerned with a measuring method and apparatus which 
is usable, for example, in an exposure apparatus for 
manufacture of semiconductor devices, for measuring or 
inspecting the correctness in superposition of printed 
patterns on a photosensitive material, in an occasion 
where electronic circuit patterns formed on articles 
such as masks or reticles (hereinafter simply 
"reticle") or those memorized as pattern data are 
printed superposedly upon one and the same substrate 
such as a semiconductor wafer, having a photosensitive 
material. In a lithographic exposure apparatus for 
manufacture of semiconductor devices wherein a circuit 
pattern of a reticle is transferred and printed on a 
photosensitive material of a wafer by using ultraviolet 
light, X-rays or the like, relative alignment of the 
reticle and the wafer is one important factor for 
attaining enhanced performance. Particularly, in the 
alignment process in recent exposure apparatuses, the 
alignment precision higher than submicron order is 
required to meet the increasing degree of integration 
of semiconductor device.  In many alignment systems, features called 
"alignment patterns" for the alignment purpose are 
provided on a reticle and a wafer and, by using 
positional information obtainable therefrom, the 
reticle-to-wafer alignment is effected. For actual 
measurement and evaluation of the alignment 
performance of an assembled apparatus, i.e., an 
exposure apparatus, conventionally a fine pattern 
formed on a reticle is superposedly printed on a wafer 
and any misregistration of the printed pattern with a 
pattern already formed on the wafer is measured through 
visual observation or image processing. With the measurement through visual 
observation, there are inconveniences such as: 
(1) It depends largely on the experience or 
skillfulness of an operator and, therefore, the 
measurement precision is not stable. (2) Since the measurement is not effected 
automatically, it requires time-consuming and 
complicated operations. (3) It is difficult to obtain high measurement 
precision. Also, with the measurement through the image 
processing, there are inconveniences such as that the 
process is complicated and requires a long time, that 
it is difficult to obtain high measurement precision, 
and the like.  It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to provide a method and apparatus for 
measuring or inspecting superposing
