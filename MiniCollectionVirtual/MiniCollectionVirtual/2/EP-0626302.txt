<ABSTRACT>
A variable length shaft assembly (24,28) 
including a first shaft (30,38) having a polygonal 

tubular end (34,46); a second shaft (32,42) having a 
correspondingly polygonal solid end (36,48) 

telescopically disposed in the polygonal tubular end; 
an arched spring (68) in a spring chamber (66) in the 

polygonal solid end having a planar body portion (70) 
bearing in sliding engagement on a planar wall (50A,B) 

of the polygonal tubular end and biasing the polygonal 
solid and tubular ends in opposite directions to a 

substantially zero clearance relationship in which 
linear clearances are reduced to substantially zero, 

and a monolithic plastic block (78) injection moulded 
in situ in the spring chamber behind the flat body 

portion. After the in situ injection moulded plastic 
solidifies, the monolith plastic block captures the 

substantially zero clearance relationship between the 
polygonal solid and tubular ends and encases the 

arched spring such that the flat body portion thereof 
defines a reinforced wear plate on the block in 

sliding engagement on the planar wall of the tubular 
polygonal end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable length
shaft assemblies in motor vehicle steering systems.US Patent No. 3,457,799, describes a motor
vehicle steering column having a column shaft assembly
for transferring steering torque and including a first
shaft having a polygonal solid end telescopically
disposed in a correspondingly polygonal tubular end of
a second shaft. Plastic is in situ injection moulded
into a clearance between the polygonal ends and into a
transverse bore through the ends. When solidified,
the plastic effects an angularly and linearly rigid
connection between the polygonal ends which persists
until the steering column experiences an energy
absorbing collapse event during which the plastic in
the clearance between the shaft ends defines a bearing
for minimising friction. FR Patent no. 2,561,605 shows a steering
column with plastic bearing rings injection moulded in situ to form
a sliding telescopic connection between the shaft and the tubular end.
In applications where the
column shaft assembly normally experiences repeated
extend/retract cycles, e.g. a length adjustable
steering column, an in situ injection moulded bearing
such as described in the aforesaid US Patent No.
3,457,799 and FR Patent no. 2,561,605 may be susceptible to wear and abrasion.US Patent No. 4,509,775, describes an
intermediate shaft assembly for transferring steering
torque between a column shaft assembly and a steering
gear in a motor vehicle steering system. The
intermediate shaft assembly includes a first shaft
having a polygonal solid end telescopically disposed
in a correspondingly polygonal tubular end of a second
shaft and an arched spring in a cavity in the solid
end bearing against a wall of the tubular end. The
spring urges the polygonal ends in relative linear
separation to a substantially zero linear clearance
relationship for torque transfer without angular lash.
During multiple extend/retract cycles characteristic 
of intermediate shaft assemblies in motor vehicle
steering systems, the spring maintains the zero
clearance relationship between the shaft ends while
sliding back and forth relative to the wall of the
tubular end.A shaft assembly according to this invention
is particularly suited for torque transfer in
applications where multiple extend/retract cycles are
normally experienced and is an improvement over the
shaft assemblies described in the aforesaid US Patent
Nos. 3,457,799 and 4,509,775 and FR Patent no. 2,561,605.A variable length shaft assembly is
accordance with the present invention is
