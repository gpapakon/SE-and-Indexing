<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly includes a male 
connector housing (4) having shafts (43) projecting from its 

opposite side walls respectively. A locking hood (2) is 
mounted on the shafts (43) to be rotatively moved about them 

between a lying state that it lies along the top of the male 
connector housing (4) and a rising state relative to the top 

of the male connector housing (4). The locking hood (2) has 
on its distal end a cam projection (13) lifted up with 

insertion of a female connector housing (9) into the male 
connector housing (4). In a temporary latching state of the 

connector housings (4, 9), the cam projection (13) is 
engaged with a cam block (14) of the female connector 

housing (9) so that the female connector housing (9) is 
displaced. The rear end of the locking hood (2) extends 

obliquely downwardly to provide an elastic member (202). 
When the locking hood (2) is rotatively moved to rise up, 

the elastic member (202) abuts against the top of the male 
connector housing (4) to elastically deform, urging the 

locking hood (2) to the former state. As a result, the 
locking hood (2) can be prevented from becoming an obstacle 

in the storage of the connector assembly and can be 
prevented from easily dropping off.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector 
assembly of the type that an operating lever is provided for 
the purpose of mating engagement of connectors. The above-described type electrical connectors in which 
the principle of a lever is utilized for the mating 
engagement of the connectors are known in the art. An 
operating lever having a guide groove is rotatably mounted 
on either one of male and female connectors. A guide pin 
provided on the other connector is inserted into the guide 
groove. The operating lever is held in a rising state 
before the mating engagement of the connectors so that the 
guide pin is easily inserted into the guide groove when the 
connectors are mated with each other. However, the operating lever is held in the rising 
state relative to the outer face of the connector housing in 
the above-described construction. Accordingly, since the 
operating levers sometimes become obstacles when the 
connectors are kept in storage facilities such as a 
stockroom, a storing efficiency of the storage facilities is 
lowered. Furthermore, the levers drop off when the 
operating levers come into contact with or collides with 
other objects during conveyance. To solve these problems, 
the prior art, for example EP-A-0 418 790, has proposed the construction that the 
operating lever be movable between a position at the time of 
the rising state and a position where the operating lever  
 
lies along the outer face of the connector housing during 
storage and conveyance. Even in the proposed construction, 
however, vibration or an external force during the 
conveyance causes the lever to easily move to the position 
of the rising state, resulting in dropout of the lever. The present invention has been made in view of the 
foregoing problems and an object thereof is to provide an 
electrical connector assembly with an operating lever 
wherein the operating lever can be prevented from becoming 
an obstacle in the storage of the connector assembly and can 
be prevented from easily dropping off. This object is solved by an electrical connector assembly according to claim 1. The present invention provides an electrical connector 
assembly comprising first and second connector housings 
fitted with each other. A pair of terminals are provided in 
the first and second connector housings respectively to be 
connected together when the first and second connector 
housing are fitted with each other. An operating lever is 
rotatably mounted on the first connector housing to be 
movable
