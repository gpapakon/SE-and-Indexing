<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of a coupling part (1) which is located on the heald-frame side and which has a jaw-like design and of a coupling part (2) located on the heald-frame drive side and having a body (10) and two locking members (11). The locking members (11) are in operative engagement and are pivoted in opposition under the effect of a force accumulator (13) and are laid against the inside of the coupling part (1) located on the heald-frame side. A coupling with a small space requirement and kinematically advantageous coupling is obtained thereby.
